It could surely have been managed in a more sympathetic way. Thousands of expert staff will be left wondering what their future holds.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This must not become a distraction from the crucial task that lies ahead: dealing with a historic workforce crisis, bringing down waiting lists and restoring the family doctor.”Three health thinktanks, the King’s Fund, theHealthFoundation and the Nuffield Trust also had reservations about the resources and energy that the changes would take up.Thea Stein, the chief executive of the Nuffield Trust, said removing duplication made sense but “profound problems facing the NHS remain: how to meet growing patient need in the face of spiralling waiting lists, and how to invest in care closer to home with the NHS’s wider finances already underwater and social care reform in the long grass”.“It is not immediately clear that rearranging the locus of the power at the top will make a huge and immediate difference to these issues, which ultimately will be how patients and the public judge the government,” she said.However, sources said Sir Jim Mackey, Amanda Pritchard’s successor as “transitional” NHS England’s chief executive, is expected to be much tougher in demanding that the service improves its performance visibly and quickly.In the Commons, Streeting praised Mackey for his “outstanding track record of turning around NHS organisations, balancing the books, driving up productivity and driving down waiting times”.The health secretary cited Prof Ara Darzi’s verdict in his review of the NHS last autumn that the creation of NHS England in 2012 byAndrew Lansley, then the health secretary, as part of a massive reorganisation under the Tory/Lib Dem coalition, had been “disastrous … a calamity without international precedent”.Join Wes Streeting in conversation with Pippa Crerar discussing England’s health and social care system and how Labour plans to turn it around on Tuesday 25 March 2025, 7pm-8.15pm (GMT).

The Guardian understands this includes managers.Det Supt Paul Hughes, the senior investigating officer, said: “As our inquiries have continued, the scope of the investigation has now widened to also include gross negligence manslaughter.“This is a separate offence to corporate manslaughter and focuses on the grossly negligent action or inaction of individuals.“It is important to note that this does not impact on the convictions of Lucy Letby for multiple offences of murder and attempted murder.”International experts said last month they had found no medical evidence to support allegations of deliberate harm after reviewing the babies’ medical records on behalf of Letby’s new defence team.TheCriminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates possible miscarriages of justice, is examining the case after receiving the findings of a detailed report by the 14 experts.It has the power to refer a case to the court of appeal if it believes there is a “real possibility” that judges would quash a conviction.Letby, 35, has alreadylost an attemptto challenge her convictions at the court of appeal.Hughes said those identified as suspects had been notified but the force would not confirm their identity or how many were under investigation. No arrests have been made.“Both the corporate manslaughter and gross negligence manslaughter elements of the investigation are continuing and there are no set timescales for these,” he said.Cheshire constabulary said its investigation into the deaths and non-fatal collapses of babies at the neonatal units of the Countess of Chester and the Liverpool women’s hospital between 2012 and 2016 was also continuing.The announcement comes days before Lady Justice Thirlwall, the judge leading thepublic inquiryinto the deaths, is scheduled to hear legal submissions for the inquiry to be paused given the CCRC is now involved.Letby’s new barrister, Mark McDonald, told the Guardian: “The timing of this is of real concern. Is this really an attempt again by the police to control the narrative right before submissions are being made to Thirlwall for it to pause.“Why are they doing this now? Is this another attempt to control the narrative? Particularly when there is substantial expert evidence that points the finger in a different direction.”McDonald said the development raised “serious question marks” about the force’s decision making.Letby was convicted of murdering four of the seven babies by injecting air into their bloodstreams and attempting to kill several others by the same method.She was also convicted of harming two babies by poisoning them with insulin, pumping air into their feeding tube, force-feeding one with milk and causing trauma to the abdomen.The international panel of experts, however, concluded there was “no medical evidence supporting malfeasance causing death or injury” in any of the babies whose cases they examined.It said there were numerous problems in the care of the babies, including a failure to properly carry out “basic medical procedures, delays in their treatment and the misdiagnosis of diseases”.Explore more on these topicsLucy LetbyHospitalsChesterEnglandNursingHealthNHSnewsShareReuse this content"

But he suggested thatUkraineshould neither rearm nor mobilise and that western military aid to Kyiv be halted during the 30-day ceasefire.Donald Trump responded briefly before a meeting with the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, saying Putin had“made a very promising statement, but it was not complete”.The US president said he was “ready to talk” to Putin. “We will see ifRussiaagrees, and if not, it will be a very disappointing moment,” he said. “I would like to see a ceasefire from Russia. We hope that Russia will do the right thing.”Putin claimed Ukraine was seeking a ceasefire because of the battlefield situation, asserting that Russian forces were “advancing almost everywhere” and nearing full control of the Kursk region, where Kyiv launched a surprise incursion last year.“How will these 30 days of [ceasefire] be used? To continue forced mobilisation in Ukraine? To supply weapons to Ukraine? … These are legitimate questions,” he said.Ukraine has previously indicated it would continue its mobilisation efforts during any ceasefire.“We need to discuss this with our American partners– perhaps a call with Donald Trump,” Putin added, thanking the US president for his involvement in the peace negotiations.Ukraine ceasefire: what’s in the proposed deal – and what’s notRead moreBy avoiding an outright rejection of Trump’s proposal, Putin appears to be balancing between not openly rebuffing Trump’s push for peace while also imposing his own stringent demands – potentially prolonging negotiations.Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, dismissed Putin’s ambivalent response to the proposal as “manipulative”.“We now have all heard from Putin’s very predictable, very manipulative words in response to the idea of a ceasefire,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly address. “As we have always said, the only one who will drag things out, the only one who will be unconstructive, is Russia.”Zelenskyy said Putin was “afraid to say directly to President Trump that he wants to continue this war”, accusing the Russian leader of “framing the idea of a ceasefire with such preconditions that nothing will work out at all, or for as long as possible”.1:54Zelenskyy says 'manipulative' Putin does not want ceasefire – videoSpeaking from the White House, Trump went into further detail on the US negotiations with Russia and Ukraine, saying that a “lot of individual subjects have been discussed”.Trump indicated that the US and Ukraine had discussed “pieces of land that would be kept and lost, and all of the other elements of a final agreement”, including a power plant. Trump said Ukraine had also brought up Nato membership.“We’ve been discussing concepts of land because you don’t want to waste time with the ceasefire if it’s not going to mean anything,” Trump said. “So we’re saying: look, this is what you can get, this is what you can’t get. Now we’re going to see if Russia’s there and if not it’s going to be a very disappointing moment for the world.”Asked whether he had any leverage to compel Russia to agree to a ceasefire, Trump said he did but did not want to go into detail.Trump said he could do“things financially that would be very bad for Russia”if a ceasefire was not agreed, but did not elaborate on whether he meantnew sanctions or tariffs.David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, said: “It would be wrong for Putin to lay conditions. Our support for Ukraine, and that of other partners, remains ironclad.”The Russian president hadtravelled to the Kursk regionon Wednesday in a rare battlefield visit, where he spoke with Russian troops who were on the verge of expelling Ukrainian forces from the land it captured last year.“What will happen in the Kursk region? Will an order be given for the troops stationed there to surrender?” Putin asked. “How the situation along the frontline will be resolved remains unclear.”Ukraine has not officially confirmed an organised retreat from the Kursk region but Zelenskyy said on Wednesday that “the military command is doing what it should do – saving the maximum number of lives of our soldiers”.A map of Russian territory gains in KurskOn Thursday, a source in Ukraine’s military who recently left the Kursk region said: “It’s over. The only question now is managing the withdrawal with as few losses as possible.”But although Ukraine appears to be withdrawing from Kursk, Kyiv has largely stabilised the front in eastern Ukraine, where a Russian offensive has stalled in recent weeks.Putin’s remarks came hours after Trump’s envoy and close ally, Steve Witkoff, landed in Moscow, where he is expected to meet Putin to push for a ceasefire after Washington’s talks with Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia.After those talks, Ukraine said it was ready to accept an immediate 30-day ceasefire and the US said it was putting the proposal to Moscow.Recent rhetoric from Russian officials has shown little urgency to reach an agreement or make concessions, as Moscow remains on the offensive on the battlefield.A Kremlin aide, Yuri Ushakov, said he had informed the US national security adviser, Mike Waltz, that Moscow views the proposed 30-day ceasefire as “nothing more than a short reprieve for Ukrainian forces”.0:38Kremlin aide says proposed ceasefire is just 'a temporary respite for Ukraine' – videoRussia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said on Thursday that Moscow was ready to discuss a US-backed peace initiative “as early as today”. But she indicated that Russia saw little urgency in a halt to fighting, reiterating it would not accept western peacekeepers in Ukraine as a security guarantee and that they would be targeted if deployed.Ukraine has said it would need some kind of security guarantee in order to sign a lasting ceasefire deal.Moscow’s continued resistance to European peacekeeping forces – seen by Ukraine as the only viable alternative to Nato membership for guaranteeing its security – presents a big obstacle to a peace acceptable to Kyiv.Observers believe Putin is determined to put forward a string of maximalist demands before agreeing to any ceasefire, which is likely to prolong negotiations.Reuters and Bloomberg have reported that Russia, in discussions with the US, has presented a list of such demands to end the war in Ukraine and reset relations with Washington. The Kremlin spokesperson,Dmitry Peskov, declined to comment on the reports.These demands could include the demilitarisation of Ukraine, an end to western military aid and a commitment to keeping Kyiv out of Nato. Moscow may also push for a ban on foreign troop deployments in Ukraine and international recognition of Putin’s claims to Crimea and the four Ukrainian regions Russia annexed in 2022.Putin could also revisit some of his broader demands from 2021, which go beyond Ukraine, including a call for Nato to halt the deployment of weapons in member states that joined after 1997, when the alliance began expanding into former communist countries.Many in Europe fear these conditions for peace could weaken the west’s ability to increase its military presence and could allow Putin to expand his influence across the continent.Explore more on these topicsRussiaVladimir PutinUkraineEuropeTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

No, we don’t want to be Danes. We want to be Greenlanders, and we want our own independence in the future,” Nielsen, 33, told Sky News. “And we want to build our own country by ourselves.”Greenland’s outgoing prime minister, Múte Egede, said he would convene a meeting of party leaders to jointly reject Trump’s threats, warning: “Enough is enough.”“This time we need to toughen our rejection of Trump. People cannot continue to disrespect us,” Egede wrote on Facebook.Egede continues to lead Greenland while a new government is formed.“The American president has once again evoked the idea of annexing us. I absolutely cannot accept that,” he wrote.“I respect the result of the election, but I consider that I have an obligation as interim head of government: I have therefore asked the administration to summon the party heads as soon as possible.”The comments came after Trump repeated his vow to take over the island on Thursday.During an Oval Office meeting with the Nato secretary general Mark Rutte, Trump claimed that Greenland’s election had been “very good for us,” adding: “The person who did the best is a very good person, as far as we’re concerned.”Asked whether he thought the US would annex Greenland, Trump said: “I think it’ll happen.”Trump said that “Denmark’s very far away” from Greenland and questioned whether that country still had a right to claim the world’s largest island.“A boat landed there 200 years ago or something. And they say they have rights to it,” Trump said. “I don’t know if that’s true. I don’t think it is, actually.”Trump said US control of Greenland could be important for national security reasons and even suggested Nato should be involved, but Rutte demurred.2:49Nato 'might have to get involved' in US takeover of Greenland, says Trump – videoWith most Greenlanders opposing Trump’s overtures, the election campaign focused more on issues such as healthcare and education than on geopolitics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Four years ago, the party finished in fourth place with 9.1%.Nuuk resident Anthon Nielsen said the party’s victory would be good for the country.“Most politicians want Greenland to be independent,” he said. “But this party who won, they don’t want to hurry things, so everything must be done right.”Carina Ren, head of the Arctic program at Aalborg University in Copenhagen, said the results show that Greenlanders tried to ignore Trump and focus on issues that were important to them.“The voters have been able to drag down all the drama, all the alarmist talk from the outside to say: ‘Well, this is about our everyday lives, our everyday concerns as citizens. Where are we going, how are we going to develop our society from the inside.’”Now, Demokraatit will have to turn its attention to forming a governing coalition.Naleraq, the most aggressively pro-independence party, finished in second place, with 24.5% of the vote.

I feel like she was infatuated with him.”Asked by Gavin Millar KC, for GNM, how she could say Powell had never been uncomfortable away from her own presence, she replied: “I am telling you, she was never uncomfortable around my husband, and even when she was not in my presence I could see she was not uncomfortable, or do I have to be physically beside her?”She also accused Davie Fairbanks, a writer, director and former creative partner of her husband, of lying. Fairbanks’s allegations include claims that Noel Clarke secretly filmed nude auditions and groped an actor at a wrap party.Iris Clarke said Fairbanks had been like a brother to her husband but had been envious of him and deceitful. “He would go around telling people not nice things about my husband to better himself,” she told the court. “He’s a liar … It’s very clear he wanted to target my husband.”She said the former Doctor Who star had tried to help Fairbanks when his friend’s mother had died and with finding a place to live. She told the court she had warned her husband that Fairbanks was manipulative but he was “always with his kind heart trying to help people”.“Noel is a person who is too generous, he’s too caring,” she said.Earlier, completing his evidence on day four in the witness box, Noel Clarke said: “I think the world has changed. I think things that were acceptable 10, 20 years ago are just no longer acceptable and throwing a blanket lens of 2021 on them is just not fair on anybody.”Explore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeGuardian Media GroupThe GuardiannewsShareReuse this content"

She worried whether he could continue to pay the hotel bill.“I told my assistant one day, ‘I have been researching car life,” she said. “I loved what I was seeing.”Despite the first night in the vehicle being “scary” she said she soon learned how to make herself feel safe. She described the first time she watched a sunset from her vehicle as “beautiful.”“I was so free, I felt like I was on a camping trip,” she said. “It was the right thing to do, I didn’t regret it.”According todatafrom the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, over 40% of the unsheltered homeless population in LA county rely on vehicles (defined as cars, vans and RVs) for shelter. According to the University of California, Los Angeles’Institute of Transportation Studies, there is a lack of research on this large and growing population.Robinson rose to fame in the early 1990s as part of En Vogue with Terry Ellis, Cindy Herron and Maxine Jones. The band would go on to become one of the most successful girl groups of all time, selling upwards of 20m records and nabbing seven Grammy nominations, with hits including Free Your Mind, Don’t Let Go (Love), Giving Him Something He Can Feel and Hold On. Billboard named them the second most successful female group of the 1990s.Explore more on these topicsUS newsR&BPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

I could have stayed at home. I am here to provide clarity to this tribunal. I’m not here to mislead.”Staley, who has a wife and two daughters, told the court: “I have been honest such that I have put my marriage at risk these last few days. I have never shied away from telling the truth about all of this … I would not try to mislead the FCA. I never have and I never will.”The comments came a day after he admitted to having intercourse with a woman on Epstein’s staff in a New York apartment owned by the child sex offender’s brother. Staley indicated that it had been consensual but had taken place without the late financier’s knowledge.The FCA had raised questions over the sexual encounter as part of efforts to illustrate that Staley and Epstein were “indeed close” and had a relationship that “went beyond one that was professional in nature”.The case centres on a letter that Barclays sent to the FCA in 2019, which declared that the pair “did not have a close relationship” and that Staley’s last contact with Epstein was “well before” he joined Barclays in 2015. The FCA had originally inquired about their ties in summer 2019, weeks after Epstein was remanded in custody to face trial for trafficking underage girls for sex.Epstein died in prison in August 2019.But Staley’s lawyer, Robert Smith KC, alleged that the FCA referred to the sexual encounter in open court “without any warning”, leading to the “public humiliation of Mr Staley” as the news hit newspaper headlines. The barrister said he was “hugely concerned on Mr Staley’s behalf that he should be treated this way”.The FCA’s lawyer, Leigh-Ann Mulcahy KC, said Staley was given an opportunity to respond in private, but had not applied to do so. “Mr Staley knew this was coming, I dealt with it as fairly and sensitively as I could, I explained the purpose, that it was not meant to intrude on his private life”, but “solely done on relevance to his relationship with Mr Epstein”.The judge, Tim Herrington, said he did not think anything more could be done at this stage, but told Smith: “You’ve made the point, and the world would have heard what has been said.”The court was shown emails suggesting that Staley and Epstein were strategising on how to deal with media inquiries over their relationship weeks beforeBarclaysannounced his appointment as CEO on 28 October 2015. The Mail on Sunday had contacted Epstein with claims he lobbied Barclays to appoint Staley both in 2012 and 2015.Epstein forwarded questions from the paper to Staley, who later replied to say: “Ok. I’m going to play is [sic] simple. I’ve known you as a client. I will tell B tomorrow. Let me know if they say something else. But stay away from them. I’m fine.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In one case, his daughter responded to Epstein’s query about whether Staley might want to be considered for a position in the US Treasury. “Spoke with him. He said not yet, but thanks,” she said.Staley said he did not recall any of those conversations, and he did not realise at the time that his daughter and Epstein were still corresponding.He is due to spend one more day in the witness box on Friday, as he is re-examined by his own lawyers in the final day of the hearing.Explore more on these topicsJes StaleyJeffrey EpsteinBankingBarclaysnewsShareReuse this content"

The disclosure has already caused frustration among ministers, given its possible repercussions.Blair’s gripe was that the act risked stopping the frank discussions needed among ministers and officials. Ever since, it has become notoriously difficult to have a freedom of information (FoI) request granted, as officials exploit various legal exemptions to refuse them.The successful use of the legislation to probe into Kyle’s AI chatbot use has led some to conclude that a new precedent has been set, one that will have officials across Whitehall sweating over their recent chatbot interactions.‘Dubious’ use of the Freedom of Information Act stopping access to files on Prince Andrew, researchers sayRead more“It’s the first time I’ve come across that information being released, but it’s completely in line with the basic principles of the act,” said Martin Rosenbaum, a former BBC journalist and FoI consultant. “If ministers or officials are doing stuff on their phone or computers which is done for work purposes on behalf of a public authority, that is subject to FoI – whatever device they’re using. The same logic would apply to whatever prompts you type intoChatGPT, or any other AI.”WhatsApp messages and texts – even on personal phones – can already be subject to FoI requests, thanks to a series of fiercely fought cases. In practice, however, officials have become adept at finding ways to knock back or heavily redact responses. Given that attitude, the granting of access to Kyle’s ChatGPT queries has shocked experts.“I’m surprised the department didn’t fight it harder,” said Rosenbaum. “Some departments would have tried to resist it all the way. Obviously, it’s going to prompt a lot of other requests.”Chris Stokel-Walker, the journalist behind the request for Kyle’s ChatGPT use, already has plans to ask for further disclosures. “My jaw dropped – I thought there was no way they’re going to give over this data,” he said. “In the time since I got the response, I have put in other requests for other generative AI interactions.”Given this success, could the act now be used to reveal ministerial Google search requests? Rosenbaum said there was no reason in law stopping such a move. “As journalists, that is a theory we should now test,” said Stokel-Walker.There is still plenty of scope to limit what is revealed, however. Access to Kyle’s ChatGPT queries was initially denied on the basis that some of his prompts were made in a personal capacity. It was later granted when the request was limited to prompts he made in an official capacity. But the difference between personal and official use is a grey area.Heather Brooke, whose use of an FoI requesthelped break the MPs’ expenses scandal, said the distinction could be used to keep information secret. “It does give power of interpretation to people who have an interest in keeping things hidden,” she said. “With MPs’ expenses, some of the most egregious abuses were the exact things that they tried to claim were private.”After this rare victory, Rosenbaum envisages a future in which AI could play an even bigger role in the legislation – becoming both the creator of requests, as well the target of them: “I’m sure FoI requesters themselves will be typing into ChatGPT – what should I request next?”Explore more on these topicsFreedom of informationArtificial intelligence (AI)Peter KyleChatGPTComputinganalysisShareReuse this content"

They said the remaining pollutants would leach into rivers as rains wore down the sediment, threatening human health in a region where river water is widely used to make up for shortages in municipal water supplies.Life returns to Ukrainian reservoir drained by Russian strike on damRead moreThe lead author, Oleksandra Shumilova, said the scale of the environmental impacts was comparable to the Chornobyl nuclear disaster.“All these pollutants that were deposited on the bottom can accumulate in different organisms, pass through the food web, and spread from vegetation to animals to humans,” said Shumilova, a scientist at the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries. “Its consequences can be compared to the effects of radiation.”The researchers linked on-the-ground measurements with remote sensing data and hydrology models to map the environmental impacts of the dam’s destruction, which flooded the region and killed 84 people. They estimated water from the breach killed 20-30% of floodplain rodents, along with the entire juvenile fish stock.They said the reservoir released 9,000-17,000 tonnes of phytoplankton each day in the first week after the dam was blown up, driving an increase in water turbidity that led to the “probable loss” of 10,000 tonnes of macroinvertebrates.The destruction of natural life detailed in the study appears to contrast with thestriking imagesof wildlife that has returned to the reservoir since the dam burst. White willows and black poplars have reforested the land, and wild boars and other animals have taken over areas that people still avoid. Fish that have not been seen for decades, such as sturgeon and herring, have returned to the water.The researchers expect that the area will reach a level of biodiversity equivalent to 80% of an undammed ecosystem within five years.“It’s not recovery, it’s better to use a word such as re-establish,” said Shumilova. “It means that it will develop its own way, but not necessarily to the initial conditions.”The Kakhovka dam, which was built in the 1950s on the Dnipro River, was destroyed on 6 June 2023 while under Russian occupation. Its reservoir supplied water to cool the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and irrigate southernUkraine.1:08Before and after Nova Kakhovka dam collapse in Ukraine – videoUkrainian ecologists have debated whether the dam should be rebuilt after the war – and how much land should be flooded if it is – with some arguing for the new ecosystem to be left alone as part of a growing movement to rewild human-disturbed areas. Shumilova said that the unresolved question of heavy metal contamination complicated this approach, because it was unclear whether the vegetation was enough to keep the exposed sediments in place.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Legal scholars say the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, which Ukraineblameson Russia, and which Russia disputes, could constitute an environmental war crime.Shah Maruf, a law researcher at the University of Dhaka who has published research on the legal consequences of the Kakhovka dam’s destruction, said the new findings “suggest that the damage is ‘widespread, long-term, and severe’, fulfilling one of the key requirements for an environmental war crime”.But he added that the speed of the ecosystem’s recovery could affect the strength of the case. “If the recovery is faster – and if that was anticipated by the perpetrator while attacking – that may compromise the finding of ‘long-term’ damage in the context of environmental war crime.”Last month, a separatestudyexploring the effects of the Kakhovka dam destruction on the Black Sea ecosystems observed some habitats and species replenishing, but found “significant habitat destruction, disturbances and pollutant damages remain”.Carol Stepien, an ecologist at the Smithsonian Institution and co-author of the study, said Ukraine’s freshwater, estuarine and marine species “evolved under conditions of longtime flux”, exposing them to a range of temperatures, salinity levels and habitat qualities.

We take a look at what this means for the health service and its patients.What has the government announced?NHS England, the body that has run the NHS in England since 2013, is being abolished. It is being merged with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), which is run by Wes Streeting, the health secretary.Starmer announced the shock – and very significant – move on Thursday in his speech on reforming the state.“Today we are abolishing the biggest quango in the world,” Streeting later said, in reference to NHS England, which has 15,000 staff. The NHS as a whole employs about 1.5 million people, mainly through 220 health trusts, and is one of the world’s biggest organisations.What did the prime minister say?Starmer portrayed the move as a cost-saving and bureaucracy-slashing exercise that would put ministers back in charge and benefit patients. “I don’t see why decisions about £200bn of taxpayer money on something as fundamental to our security as the NHS should be taken by an arm’s length body, NHS England,” the prime minister said.“And I can’t, in all honesty, explain to the British people why they should spend their money on two layers of bureaucracy [NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care]. That money could and should be spent on nurses, doctors, operations, GP appointments.”What did Starmer mean by ‘two layers of bureaucracy’?NHS England was created in October 2013, when it was initially called the NHS Commissioning Board. Since then, it and the DHSC have contained many teams of officials who each do roughly or exactly the same thing. For example, each has a dedicated team covering different areas of care such as GP services, mental health and urgent and emergency care (A&E and ambulance services).In his speech, Starmer cited these examples of duplication in the course of justifying his shake-up of the NHS: “Is it a good idea for the frontline of the NHS to get rid of two sets of comms teams, two sets of strategy teams, two sets of policy teams, where people are basically doing the same thing? Yes, it is.”What does NHS England do?Its key role was to commission clinical commissioning groups – local NHS bodies, which replaced primary care trusts – to provide the range of clinical services needed in their areas, such as GP care.Its name changed to NHS England in spring 2013, by which time Jeremy Hunt had replaced Andrew Lansley as the health secretary.It directs, manages and oversees the whole of the health service in England, including its 1.5 million staff and its budget, which from next month is due to be close to £200bn. It is responsible for ensuring that the NHS’s key waiting times, such as the supposed maximum four-hour wait for A&E care and 18-week wait for hospital treatment, are delivered.Thisdocumentexplains things in more detail.What will happen to NHS England’s 13,000 staff?Some will be made redundant, while the others will start working for the DHSC. Both organisations have their head offices in London: the DHSC’s HQ is in Westminster while NHS England’s is in nearby Waterloo. Both also have premises in different parts of the country, including Leeds.Amanda Pritchard, NHS England’s outgoing chief executive, told staff in an email on Monday that as a direct result of the DHSC’s decision to change its relationship with the NHS, the size of “the centre” – the NHS England/DHSC axis in London – “could … decrease by around half”. NHS England staff working for its 42 integrated care boards – regional bodies which oversee NHS trusts in their area – were told that half of them would be losing their jobs.What changes are being made to the leadership of NHS England?Pritchard announcedon 25 Februarythat she would be leaving at the end of this month.Most of the organisation’s most senior executives have since said they too will be standing down at the same time, including the medical director, Prof Steve Powis, on 6 March, and the deputy chief executive and chief finance officer, Julian Kelly, on 10 March.Pritchard is being replaced by Sir Jim Mackey, and the outgoing chair, Richard Meddings, by Dr Penny Dash, a doctor and former McKinsey executive who chairs the NHS’s integrated care board in north-west London.Had Starmer or Streeting dropped any hints they were considering taking the dramatic step of abolishing NHS England?No. Both the prime minister and health secretary have spoken a lot about their plans to enact bold reform of the NHS in England. Starmer had promised that his government would execute the most radical reform of the service since its creation in 1948.But neither had given any clue that the abolition of NHS England, and its merger with the DHSC, was on the cards.In fact, Streeting had specifically ruled out a merger in the course of an interview with theHealth Service Journal(HSJ) as recently as 31 January.Join Wes Streeting in conversation with Pippa Crerar discussing England’s health and social care system and how Labour plans to turn it around.

As if!Trafalgar theatre, LondonAmy Heckerling adapts her own iconic screenplay for a lumbering production in need of more belters from composer KT TunstallArifa AkbarThu 13 Mar 2025 18.00 EDTShareWhat do you get if you cross a high-school movie with Jane Austen’s comedy of manners?Clueless, of course. The 1995 film was inspired by the plot of Emma, in which a frivolous young schemer falls for the serious-minded landed gent next door. This musical version again transposes the story of misguided friend-zoning to Beverly Hills High but where the film pulled off the outlandish melange of Austen and Americana, Rachel Kavanaugh’s production is a more lumbering hybrid.Emma is reborn as Cher (Emma Flynn), a wealthy LA valley-girl with an ensemble of privileged high schoolers around her who may well be branded nepo babies today. She manipulates grungy new girl Tai (Romona Lewis-Malley), all for the greater good of transforming her into a paragon of high-school popularity. Josh (Keelan McAuley), meanwhile, is the serious-minded chap who is helping Cher’s lawyer father with his cases and has a teasing relationship with her that builds into love.We are definitely in the 1990s because people are using Walkmans, talking lavishly about their pagers and brandishing brick-like mobile phones. Amy Heckerling adapts her own screenplay, sticking closely to the original, including the jibes about high-school cosmetic surgery, although mercifully Cher’s obsessive calorie talk has been excised.View image in fullscreenNeeds more fizz … l to r, Emma Flynn (Cher), Keelan McAuley (Josh) in Clueless.Photograph: Pamela RaithThe songs, composed byKT Tunstall, are disappointingly flat-footed except for two belters accompanied by comically energised choreography. Reasonable Doubts, sung by Josh and the ensemble, is a magnificent ode to teen jealousy, while I’m Keeping an Eye on You, performed when Josh turns up to a dance to watch over Cher, is as winning.If the score could fizz with more numbers like these then what a blast this show might be. But the lyrics by Glenn Slater too often serve as exposition rather than raising the emotional drama.The characters are peculiarly flat. Cher has flecks of Elle from Legally Blonde, Tai sounds like a cross between Bette Midler and Rizzo from Grease, Cher’s love interest Christian (Isaac J Lewis) speaks like a 1950s cliche. Josh is obnoxiously judgmental of Cher with the song Human Barbies, in which he accuses her of treating others like dolls. Maybe if he had watched Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, he might see things differently, although the script references nothing outside its 90s bubble – even when it is crying out for sly sideways glances, such as the moment in class whenCher debatesthe all too Trumpian question of whether immigrants should be admitted to the US.Still, the performances are strong, full of grinningly nasal high-school energy. Flynn nails the comedy in Cher’s failed seduction of Christian, while Blake Jordan, as the stoner skateboarder Travis, is sweetly portrayed, too. There is also some consolation in Mikiko Suzuki MacAdams’s clever set design, which sees sofas transforming into cars and a backdrop of the LA skyline changing colours to suit the mood. But this is a paler version of the film, laden with the retro “naff” factor but having less creativity and soul. The theatrical deification of the 1990s evidently continues apace, for the worse.AtTrafalgar theatre, London, until 27 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsWest EndKT TunstallCluelessreviewsShareReuse this content"

The bottle-blond younger sister, with no formal training and a drug addiction that was the fashion industry’s worst kept secret, was seen as a sentimental appointment by a shell-shocked family.She proved everyone wrong. Versace is now defined as much by Donatella as by Gianni. Shesteps down from designingafter 27 years as an icon in her own right, one of the most successful female designers in modern fashion history. Sober for 20 years, she has steered Versace to become a global household name, valued at $2bn (£1.6bn) when it wassold to Capri Holdingssix and a half years ago.View image in fullscreenGianni and Donatella Versace in 1998.Photograph: Paul Schmulbach/ShutterstockVersace found her voice as a designer and as a champion of LGBTQ+ rights. She was praised fortaking a stand against Italy’s anti-gay policiesafter saying in a speech in 2023: “Our government is trying to take away people’s rights to live as they wish.”She looked destined to be consigned to the fashion history books with the untimely death of GianniVersace. But her talent and determination have helped the brand thrive as a living force that still has the power to set trends, and made it potent and desirable to a generation of consumers who have only ever known her as its designer. Gianni recognised and championed her instincts – the safety pin as a Versace motif was an idea she had brought to his atelier – and her fluency with the codes of the house fuelled a growing self-confidence.With an appetite for pop culture, many of Versace’s defining moments, from Jennifer Lopez in a jungle-green dress slashed to the navel in 2019 to a collection co-designed with Dua Lipa in 2023, have happened under her watch. She has been a hands-on presence in the design studio. “Versace is what it is today because of Donatella Versace,” said Emmanuel Gintzburger, the brand’s chief executive, when the succession plan was announced.In private, she is kind and generous, funny and self-aware. When a journalist enquired how old her adored jack russell was during an interview in 2016, she replied: “Audrey is eight – but can you write six?” Her cartoonish image – shellacked walnut skin, platinum hair, petite frame jacked up on spike heels – belies a lack of ego unusual in a star designer.She has always seen herself as the custodian queen of Versace, with a responsibility to keep her brother’s spirit alive. That she is handing her job title to Dario Vitale, a well-respected designer and image maker who has played a major role in the success of Miu Miu,one of the hottest brands in the world, demonstrates her desire to champion the Versace name, not just her own. “I am excited to see Versace through new eyes,” she said in a statement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Johnny Mathis – Fall in Love (I Want To) (1981)It was criminal that Mathis’s label cancelled the release of his Chic-produced album, I Love My Lady. Finally brought out in 2017, it sounded marvellous: Rodgers had leaned on his love of jazz, lending the funk a slightly Steely Dan-ish edge. Fall in Love is fabulous: Mathis’s gossamer vocals floating above a hypnotic, mid-tempo groove.View image in fullscreenChic … (from left) Bernard Edwards, Norma Jean Wright, Nile Rodgers and Tony Thompson in 1977.Photograph: Gilles Petard/Redferns19. Chic – Dance Dance Dance (Yowsa Yowsa Yowsa) (1977)Taking inspiration from the 1930s was a disco trope – check Dr Buzzard’s Original Savannah Band’s swing-infused debut album or Carrie Lucas’s fabulous Tic Toc – but Dance Dance Dance’s re-appropriation of bandleader Ben Bernie’s catchphrase “yowsa yowsa yowsa!” was the most successful example of the lot: that it was aligned to a killer groove helped.18. Norma Jean – Saturday (1978)The eponymous solo album by Chic’s former vocalist is the great overlooked Rodgers and Edwards production of their golden era. Saturday perfectly evokes the anticipation before a night out, but doesn’t skirt the drudgery a night out provides escape from. Currently the theme to Ant and Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway, which rather misses the point.17. Chic – Soup for One (1982)Good tracks are scattered across Chic’s unloved 80s albums, but Soup for One is their last unequivocal classic: spacier and synth-ier than their 70s output, there’s a hint of the electronic boogie sound prominent in contemporary New York clubs. Its riff will be immediately familiar to latterday listeners thanks to the sample on Modjo’s 2000 chart-topper Lady.View image in fullscreenBernard Edwards and Nile Rogers in a New York recording studio in 1981.Photograph: Allan Tannenbaum/Getty Images16. Madonna – Like a Virgin (1984)The album that turned Madonna into a superstar was evidence of both Rodgers’ hitmaking nous and his adaptability as a producer. Its modish synth-heavy sound bore no resemblance to Chic … almost. Listen closely to the title track and you can hear his trademark staccato guitar driving the whole thing along.15. Chic – At Last I Am Free (1978)Chic’s ballads got less attention than their dancefloor-focused tracks, but At Last I Am Free deserves real shine. It’s an account of being teargassed at a Black Panther rally and the ensuing sense of disillusion, but it’s disguised as a sumptuous, crestfallen love song.Robert Wyatt’s coverdug into the song’s dejected mood.14. Sister Sledge – We Are Family (1979)Arguably the most famous Chic track of all – a song that has been played at everything from feminist rallies to sports victories and that’s clearly going to provoke party singalongs for the rest of time – was actually intended to reintroduce Sister Sledge to record buyers after a series of flops. Incredibly, their record label initially rejected it.View image in fullscreenDiana Ross in 1981.Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/CBS/Getty Images13. Diana Ross – I’m Coming Out (1980)After encountering drag queens dressed as Diana Ross, Rodgers and Edwards aimed to write her a gay anthem with the same power as Say It Loud – I’m Black and I’m Proud (Ross thought the lyrics referred to her breaking free of Motown’s strictures). A joy from start to finish, it became a huge hit and ultimately, achieved its initial aim.12. Sister Sledge – He’s the Greatest Dancer (1979)The faint hint that disco was perhaps getting a little too popular for its own good lurks on He’s the Greatest Dancer’s hymn to a designer-clad Adonis: the dancefloor is packed with “out-of-towners touring”. The problem being that another Chic-penned song as great as this was only going to make disco bigger.11. Daft Punk – Get Lucky (ft Pharrell Williams and Nile Rodgers) (2013)Rodgers’ 21st-century output has been of deeply variable quality, but Get Lucky was a global smash for a reason. A fantastic song built around Rodgers’ unmistakeable guitar, its take on disco is neither knowingly retro nor noticeably modern; even before it became completely inescapable it somehow sounded weirdly familiar, as if it always existed.10. Carly Simon – Why? (1982)A new direction for the Chic Organization’s sound: Rodgers’ guitar plays a reggae off-beat, the rhythm track is influenced by electro, Simon’s voice is cushioned by swathes of synth. The results are magic, the 12in mix a club perennial. Lumbered with an absolutely mortifying video, it flopped in the US, but was a huge European hit.9. David Bowie – Let’s Dance (1983)The Rodgers-produced Let’s Dance album may have been the moment when Bowie’s artistic quality control finally slackened in the quest for commercial acceptance, but the title track is magnificent: a brand of pop more strange and tense than its global smash status and its ubiquity following Bowie’s death might suggest.View image in fullscreenSheila & B Devotion in 1979.Photograph: ullstein bild Dtl./ullstein bild/Getty Images8. Sheila & B Devotion – Spacer (1979)As a point of contrast, it’s worth playing Sheila and B Devotion’s first British hit, a disco version of Singin’ in the Rain: it’s gormless tripe. Enter the Chic Organization, and Shelia and B Devotion are utterly transformed. From its wistful piano intro to its rock-y guitar solo, Spacer is sleek, sexy and surprisingly sparse perfection.7. Chic – I Want Your Love (1978)Chic at their vertiginous zenith, when Rodgers and Edwards seemed incapable of making anything that didn’t sound simultaneously flawless and effortless: the simplicity of the four-note hook balanced out by the complexity of the slow-building horn and string arrangement, which achieves euphoric take off at 3min 25sec.6. Chic – Everybody Dance (1977)More so than their debut single, Everybody Dance defined Chic’s sound, their ethos of music as a form of luxury goods: sophisticated, spare but somehow sumptuous, driven by incredible musicianship (listen to Edwards’s bass), lyrics that hymn the dancefloor as the cure for whatever might be ailing you.View image in fullscreenSister Sledge c 1980.Photograph: Gijsbert Hanekroot/Redferns5. Sister Sledge – Thinking of You (1979)A song that sounds like falling in love feels: check out the breakdown at 2min 53sec, when the strings relax into a gorgeous shimmer, Edwards hits a single bass note and Kathy Sledge sighs: “I’m in love again” – the most beautiful moment in the Chic Organization’s entire catalogue.4. Chic – Le Freak (1978)Rejection made creatively profitable. Originally a complaint about Rodgers and Edwards being refused entry to Studio 54, titled Fuck Off (there’s still a snarky quality to the finished song’s suggestion you “come on down to the 54”), Le Freak’s irresistible call to the dancefloor sold 7m copies, proof that living well is the best revenge.3. Diana Ross – Upside Down (1980)In a sense, Chic’s Diana Ross collaboration was a disaster: Ross hated the results and had the album remixed; the whole business ended up in court. But musically, it was magic, and nowhere more so than on Upside Down, potent enough to buck America’s disco backlash and reach No 1.2. Sister Sledge – Lost in Music (1979)Rodgers said We Are Family was “hands down” the Chic Organization’s greatest album, and Lost in Music – presumably inspired by Sister Sledge’s scuffling years prior to the album’s release – is its crowning glory: a song and production so perfect it never loses its power to transport you to a better place.1. Chic – Good Times (1979)Even in a catalogue as rich as Chic’s, Good Times stands out. For one thing, it’s got a hook of simplistic perfection and the greatest bass line Edwards ever came up with (one of the great bass lines full stop, sampled umpteen times since it was first borrowed by hip-hop pioneers the Sugarhill Gang). For another, it’s infinitely smarter than your average dependable party anthem, packed with lyrical references that equate America’s then-current economic situation to the Great Depression (“Happy days are here again,” it opens, mordantly). If you need proof that Chic were a cut above their disco peers, here it is.Explore more on these topicsRankedNile RodgersDiscoDance musicPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But – given the enduring and increasingly scandalous horrors those victims are facing in a country whose appallingly flawed legal approach haseffectively decriminalised the act– someone’s got to do it.This time it is Stacey Dooley’s job. The two-part documentary Rape on Trial focuses on the difficulties presented by cases in which the supposed perpetrator and victim are known to each other. It also looks at the suffering caused by the ever-lengthening delays between rapes being reported and reaching trial, in the surpassingly rare instance (despite recent efforts to improve matters) that the Crown Prosecution Service agrees to let them proceed. The documentary was slated to take a year to film – it ended up taking three, so slow was the progress on any of the cases its makers were following.Dooley deploys her natural talent for exuding a kind of stalwart sympathy as she interviews three women who all knew the men they say raped them, as they wait for their cases to be heard. Jessie (all the women have waived their right to anonymity and appear on camera) endured, she says, repeated unwanted sex from her much older boyfriend when she was a teenager. (“I would wake up with him inside me.”) It is four years from the time of her reporting the rape to getting a verdict. In the meantime, he is out on bail and Jessie frequently sees him around town, and working near her house. Jessie’s mother, Michelle, says that her daughter has become all but unrecognisable under the strain. “She means everything to me, that girl, and I just want her back.” Jessie’s is a rare case in that she has additional witnesses, including a former girlfriend of the defendant and another woman who each say he raped them too. Will three women’s word against one man’s be enough to win what one defence solicitor calls “the credibility battle” in court? How much does it take to persuade a jury not just that you are telling the truth but to meet the required standard of proof – that the accused could have had no reasonable belief in consent?Emma says she was orally raped at 16 by a classmate in college. Until then, she says, she thought “to be frozen with fear” was just an expression. “You can’t move. You don’t believe it, but it’s true.” Her mum persuaded her to report him to the police. The trial has been postponed three times. “I’ve just got to do it because if not I’ll regret it for the rest of my life … even though I’m dying inside.” She has been suicidal – a woman once intervened as she was attempting to kill herself. After that, Emma’s father slept in a sleeping bag in front of the front door every night so they could keep her safe. In cross-examination, the defence suggests she has made the whole thing up because she was in love with the popular, wealthy accused. Emma is 19 before she gets a verdict. As she sobs uncontrollably in its wake, her mother puts her arms around her and stares dry-eyed into an incomprehensible future.Becca says she was raped by a man she was dating at university. “I felt like I knew him, then in that moment I realised I didn’t know him at all.” She waits three and a half years for the trial, before which she is advised by the witness service team to wear muted colours and keep her shoulders covered. The defence suggests that Becca, as a former drama student, has made up her story for effect.Dooley is the right person for the emotional parts – straightforward, unobtrusive and safe without being soft. But she is underpowered in the interviews with others, such as the deputy national lead on rape and serious sexual offences, Siobhan Blake, and defence lawyers who represent alleged rapists.It will, as Jessie – incandescent with fury alongside her misery – hopes, heighten awareness of the problems faced by claimants who enter this profoundly flawed system and the endemic biases that greet them from every quarter. But it is hard to admire a documentary that doesn’t also move the conversation on. This could be done by proffering some possible answers to what can be done to redress inbred prejudices that accompany he said/she said trials in which there is no forensic or other evidence. Or by interviewing people who have some idea of what reforms can be made to the law, examining what difference further funding could make, or how we change a culture in which disbelief of rape claims is/seems to be the default position. .It is difficult to feel anything very much apart from profound admiration for the women involved, and the loving people who support them, and a profound despair at their suffering – and that which is still to come.Stacey Dooley: Rape on Trial aired on BBC Three and is on iPlayer.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

It usually takes a government a couple of years or so to blame the government for stopping it from achieving what it wants to do. Keir Starmer has got there in eight months. There again, most governments have a clear plan when they get into office, so maybe it takes them longer to notice. With a few honourable exceptions, Labour never had that vision – all their focus had been on winning the election – so maybe without the distraction of having a plan that was being blocked, it took them less time to blame the government for being the problem.Here things took a further turn to the meta. How many people does it take to deliver a speech on cutting the size of the state and making efficiency savings? There appears to be no upper limit. Because it felt as if we had been drip-fed most of the speech over the previous four days. So much so that for much of its duration it felt as if you already knew it word for word. Ministers need to be careful what they ask for when they talk of making efficiencies.First we had Pat McFadden out on the airwaves last Sunday talking about how the government was planning to cut civil service numbers. Pat makes the Grim Reaper look like a Cheerful Chappy, so he was the ideal outrider to let people know they could expect to be repurposed. Over the next few days there were further details from other ministers and lobby briefings. This wasn’t going to be a bonfire of the quangos – this was to be no Elon Musk Doge exercise, even if it looked rather like it and some of the language sounded much the same. This was a more sensitive, thoughtful exercise. Caring Cuts. Ozempic Cuts. Not cuts for the hell of it.On Thursday morning, in the research and development campus of Reckitt in Hull, we finally reached the endpoint. If not the beginning of the end, then at least the end of the beginning. First, a correction. This wasn’t to be considered a speech. Even though it would involve the prime minister standing up and talking for the best part of 30 minutes before taking questions. Rather, it was an “intervention”. You could apparently tell because Keir wasn’t wearing a jacket. Wide-eyed and tieless. Mr Informality.Starmer began with a brief riff on his hosts – repeating back to them what they had already told him: just to show he had been paying attention – before warming to his theme. He had been elected on a promise of change and was determined to deliver.We were living in insecure times and we needed to be strong. To get people and the country working better. And things were improving but not nearly as fast as he would have liked. He believed in the power of government to change lives but didn’t think we were getting good value from the state.Government was overstretched and unfocused. It was time for the state to stop expanding. To let AI do the work of civil servants. Come to think of it, he might also have got AI to deliver this speech. Even when he believes in what he’s saying, Starmer sounds as if he’s struggling to stay awake for the end of the sentence.Now things became a little confusing as Keir cut to the civil service. He really, really loved civil servants. Thought they were the best of the best. This might have come as a shock to the civil servants as a few months ago he had rubbished them as a waste of space. A bunch of lazy bastards whose first instinct was always to say no.Never mind. Let’s assume Keir has had a change of heart. What wasn’t so clear was what he imagined would happen to the civil servants after the efficiencies had been made. He rather glossed over the job losses bit to focus on the benefits for the civil servants. More time to do other things. Like marvel at the wonders of AI. Admire the view out the window. Bread making. Quality of life. The way he was speaking made it sound as if he was thinking of employing more civil servants to make sure that those civil servants with less to do were feeling happy and valued.It was much the same for the quangos themselves. Although there were definitely far too many quangos, he wouldn’t actually commit to getting rid of any. Not even the one in Bingley whose sole purpose was to throw cricket balls at buildings. Or something like that. Keir sounded as muddled as I felt. He also never fully explained how it was that his own government had created more than 20 of its own quangos in the past six months. It wouldn’t have been a surprise if he had announced a new quango to oversee the abolition of other quangos. OFQUANG.“We are driving change forward with a plan for change,” Starmer continued. Just as everyone was trying to work out what the hell that meant and which bit of defective AI had written that deadening sentence, Keir dropped his bombshell. A genuine piece of news in an otherwise forgettable speech. Sorry, “intervention”. He was planning to get rid ofNHSEngland. The NHS would become the sole responsibility of the government and not some arm’s length body. No more duplication. It was such an obvious idea you wondered why no one had thought of it earlier. Perhaps we will soon find out.Then came the questions from the media. GB News became excited at the possibility of the government dropping all its diversity, equity and inclusion policies. An end to wokery. Starmer had to let the broadcaster down gently. This was all about cutting with kindness. Others wondered if this was a return to austerity. Again, Keir said no. Everything would remain just the same but different.Mostly, though, the hacks wanted to know about the planned benefits cuts. Next week’s news that Labour had started briefing the media about long before Starmer had completed this week’s news cycle. Confused? You should be. Efficiency savings have yet to penetrate No 10. Do as I say, not as I do.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe politics sketchNHSPublic services policyHealthPublic sector cutsPublic financenewsShareReuse this content"

The UK spent £58.5m on sourdough in the year to March 2024, according to Kantar data.

The thought of starting a starter may give you lockdown flashbacks, but it’s easy to incorporate into a busy (read: normal, sane) schedule with significantly less hands-on time than you might think once you get the hang of it.Here are all the bits you’ll need to get started, and the things you don’t need to waste your money on. Enjoy the journey – it’s magic.Sourdough essentialsGood flourEverything begins with the flour. To get started you’ll need strong white bread flour, rye flour and strong wholemeal flour. Quality is crucial: sourdough made with basic supermarket flour will be … basic. It simply won’t look or taste anywhere near as good as loaves made with high-quality grain.The most charming thing to do, obviously, is to find your own local wheat farmers and mills and support them. Failing that,Shipton Millis a favourite with UK bakers for producing various consistently reliable flours.Wildfarmed– or as I like to call it, Rave Flour, because it was founded by Andy Cato, 50% of Groove Armada – is increasingly popular for its regenerative backstory.Wessex Millhas several interesting, seeded and flavoured flours often available in delis and supermarkets, but my personal favourite isNR Stoate & Sonsin Dorset, whose stoneground malted bread flour, Maltstar, is almost sinfully delicious. Then there’sGilchesters Organics, a heritage grain farm that supplies flour toCoombeshead Farm bakery. You’ll also need a bag of millet or brown rice flour for dusting bannetons (baskets) to prevent dough from sticking –Shipton Millsells both.Incidentally, the more flour you have in your kitchen, the more wild yeast there will be flying around the air, and the more active your sourdough starter will be. Just watch out for bugs: flour mites, weevils and pantry moths (shudder) love munching on grain, so keep flour in sealed containers and check them regularly for anything, ahem, wriggly.View image in fullscreenGilchesters Organics unbleached white strong wheat flourFrom £3.50 at Gilchesters OrganicsView image in fullscreenNR Stoate & SonsMaltstar flourFrom £3.58 at NR Stoate & Sons‘Hands down my favourite bit of kit’: 13 kitchen gadgets top chefs can’t live withoutRead moreA jam jarSourdough sounds complicated, but making a sourdough starter couldn’t be simpler. Truly. It’s just a case of mixing a small amount of flour with a small amount of water, leaving it alone for 24 hours, and repeating that process a few times until you see bubbles, which should be in three or four days. And all you need to do this in is a clean jam jar with a lid.You don’t need a fancy jar, you don’t need a fancy spoon, and you don’t need to cover the top in gauze lest the yeasts can’t get in through the lid. Don’t panic – the yeasts will be fine. ABonne Maman 370g jam jar– jam eaten, jar washed, lid on loosely – is perfect. A pickle or kimchi jar is also ideal;Eaten Aliveones are the perfect size, and imbuing your starter with the scent of spiced fermented cabbage can only be a good thing as far as I’m concerned. If you want to go slightly fancy, aWeck 850ml jarwith a glass lid – seal and clasps removed just in case your starter wishes to keep expanding until the jar explodes, which genuinely will happen – will probably look the poshest on your kitchen island, if posh-looking kitchen islands are your jam.View image in fullscreenBonne Maman strawberryconserve, 370g£3.30 at Ocado£3.30 at Sainsbury’sView image in fullscreenWeck 850ml jar£6.18 at eBayThe best pans for every type of cooking – chosen by chefsRead moreWeighing scalesBaking isn’t the same as cooking, pals, and while too little salt in a stew is a rectifiable slip-up, too little salt in a batch of sourdough can leave you with a pancaked brick that has only one destiny: the compost heap. A trusty set of digital weighing scales will ensure you measure all your ingredients – especially the salt – accurately. Once you decide it’s time to open your own micro-bakery – heck, why not, everyone else is doing it – an industrial-grade scale can measure weights of up to 15kg.View image in fullscreenLakeland weighing scales£19.99 at Lakeland£19.99 at AmazonView image in fullscreenIndustrial bench scale£190.78 at Nisbets£135.95 at AmazonDough scrapersWhen it comes to dough scrapers, you want two of these little tools: a curved plastic one for scraping down your mixing bowl, and a straight metal one for cutting, shaping and handling your dough, and scraping down your workbench afterwards. The more sourdough you make, the more nimble you’ll be with them. Sourdough dough dries and hardens, sticking like cement to absolutely anything. Be rigorous about cleaning up as you go or you’ll end up with rock-hard doughy gubbins all over your kitchen worktops, floors, walls and – if you’re a particularly flamboyant baker – ceiling.View image in fullscreenCurved scraper£9.99 for five at eBay£2.96 at AmazonView image in fullscreenStainless steel scraper£5 at ProCook£13 at DunelmBannetonsView image in fullscreenOnce you’ve mixed, fermented and shaped your sourdough, you need to leave it to rest in something that will hold its shape before you bake it, either at room temperature for a few hours or – ideally, for depth of flavour – overnight in the fridge. Traditionally, this is done in a cane proving basket, also called a banneton, which comes in two shapes,roundand oval, and many sizes, depending on how much your dough weighs. I prefer oval because they’re easier to stack side by side in the fridge if you’re making several loaves simultaneously, and because a long oval loaf makes more sense in terms of sandwiches. It’s a good idea to get two because many recipes yield two loaves.View image in fullscreenOval banneton£14.38 at Nisbets£18 at John LewisView image in fullscreenRoundbanneton£18 at John Lewis£21.99 for two at AmazonA baker’s lameOnce your beautiful, rested dough comes out of the banneton, you’ll need to score it with a blade before it goes in the oven. This helps the loaf rise in an orderly fashion – ie upwards. If you don’t score it, the gases will find their own weak point to escape from – often at the base of the dough, giving your loaf a funny sort of foot as it bakes. A knife won’t work for this job – you need a baker’s lame, which is essentially a razor blade on a stick. Many lames come with a pack of razor blades, which will see you through many bakes.View image in fullscreenWalfos lame and six razor blades£15.17 at AmazonView image in fullscreenSteel lame£24.95 at Rackmaster£41.98 at EtsyA Dutch ovenThe best way to make sourdough that looks like it’s emerged from a bakery is to bake it inside a Dutch oven. You can use any cast-iron casserole pot that holds about 5 litres, but what you really want is one with a flat lid so you can flip the whole thing upside down, lay and score your dough in the shallower lid, and reduce the likelihood of you either mangling your precious dough baby as you drop it into the hot pot or – more importantly – burning yourself.

The best thing to do, at the start of your journey, is to pick a side and stick to it. The book I learned from is Tartine Bread by Chad Robertson, owner of the legendary San Francisco bakery, butThe Perfect Loaf by Maurizio Leo, author of the award-winning sourdough blog of the same name, is also a bit of a bible.The Dusty Knuckle has written a bookbased on everything learned by running the killer bakery in east London, as has Michelle Eshkeri, owner of north London’s beloved Margot Bakery, in her bookModern Sourdough.View image in fullscreenTartineBreadby Chad Robertson£20.87 at Amazon£30 at BlackwellsView image in fullscreenThe Perfect Loaf by Maurizio Leo£30.36 at WHSmith£24.98 at AmazonDon’t bother with …AthermometerIf you want to get super-duper science class about making sourdough, sure, get a probe thermometer (nothing I’ve used beats aThermapen). However, it’s not initially necessary, will make you stressed even thinking about making sourdough in the winter, and can prevent you from developing innate sourdough instincts, which is the key to bread-baking becoming second nature.ShowercapsCovering your dough with a shower cap while it proves to stop it from drying out is unnecessary. Bakeries aren’t covering 200 loaves with shower caps every night before they close their fridges and, what’s more, a little bit of dryness at the top of the dough will stop it from sticking to your gloves when you scoop it out of the banneton to bake.A proving machineUnless you live in an igloo, there should always be a warm enough spot in your house to make sourdough, even in the dead of British winter. It could be simply near a radiator or inside a switched-off oven with the light on. Yes, sourdough will ferment, grow and prove faster in the summer and slower when it’s cooler, but there are ways to speed things up when it’s cold, such as using hot water or adding more sourdough starter to your mix. If you do live in an igloo, here’s aBrod & Taylor proving machineyou can try.Martha de Lacey is a freelance writer and sourdough baking teacher, now on a baby-based in-person teaching hiatus, from which she is soon to emerge.

I suspected they had something to do with the neurological and physiological changes ofperimenopausebut was frustrated by the absence of clear answers about what was happening to my middle-aged body. Lacking few nuanced representations of this period of life, I began looking at what midlife looks like elsewhere in nature.It was inspiring. Trees, for instance, illustrate the capaciousness of midlife: as they mature, they add rings to their ever-expanding trunks. Mature treesin urban areas– those 20 years and up – remove higher levels of air pollution, sequester more carbon from the atmosphere and provide much more leaf area and shade than their younger counterparts.Another example, leaf cutter ants, showed how midlife can bring change in purpose. These ants forage plant material in order to cultivate fungal gardens, which they use to feed larvae. As ants age and become less efficient at cutting leaves, they transition to different but no less vital tasks, including waste management, removing harmful fungus and managing waste. Elder ants continuemaking meaningful contributionsas they age, which may contribute to them living longer.What a sex educator wants you to know about sexual incompatibilityRead moreBut the most moving example involved Orca whales, my neighbors here in the Pacific north-west. Humans and orcas are two of only six mammals that experience menopause. (The other four are false killer whales, belugas, narwhals and short-finned pilot whales.)A few years ago, I heardan interviewwith Dr Deborah Giles, research director ofWild Orca, that piqued my interest. Giles is one of the world’s experts on southern resident killer whales, an endangered community of just 73 living in the coastal waters of the Pacific north-west. These whales live in three separate pods – social groups of closely related animals led by post-reproductive females – that speak their own dialects but share a common language.“The older females, besides being the repositories of knowledge … lead very rich lives,” Giles said. While all these whales are very tactile and sexual – young males spar with each other using their prehensile penises – post-menopausal females commonly engage in sexual activity and play with both young males and males of reproductive age.Remembering the orcas [...] reminds me to find time for sensual, physical pleasureThis was the most intriguing and inspiring morsel of sexual information I’d heard in a decade. Researchers surmise that these older females are educating males about sex, but also participating in encounters that are sensual and playful without any biological imperative – only pleasure.As my menstrual cycle sputters and revs, my vulvar moisture evaporates and my daily responsibilities accumulate, I occasionally forget that I have a sex drive. Remembering the orcas always makes me smile and reminds me to find time for sensual, physical pleasure – by myself and with my spouse – with no goal beyond feeling good.The sex lives of these orcas is a juicy subject, but these days I find myself thinking more about what Giles said about these whales being “repositories of knowledge”. They are matriarchs, leaders, navigators and teachers valued and celebrated for their expertise accumulated over a lifetime. It’s a powerful corrective to the ageism older women face – an increasing feeling of invisibility and irrelevance in a society that prizes youth.Last fall, I curated a series of conversations at the Seattle Public Library about female middle age and invited Giles to be part ofa discussionon different models of middle age along with Laura Da’, an Indigenous Eastern Shawnee poet, and Putsata Reang, a queer Cambodian journalist. She agreed, in part because her work at Wild Orca is about spreading the word about the whales’ dwindling population and deteriorating environmental conditions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They hold the memory of life before the natural world was disrupted and disturbed by humans – evidence of a world we benefit from but can barely comprehend.The oldest known orca fossil is at least 2.5m years old andscientists believekiller whales have existed in some form for more than 50m years. The scale and scope is staggering – modern humans only have a 300,000-year history on this planet. The plight of these whales saddens and frightens me, but their existence makes me hopeful.

And what can you do to cover up an old flame’s name? Top tattooists, including David Beckham’s artist, reveal allSarah PhillipsThu 13 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 13 Mar 2025 10.36 EDTShareFind the right artist for you“My customers generally come to me for my style,” says Aly Sidgwick, a tattoo artist atTake Notein Edinburgh. “I do a lot of woodland creatures, like bats, badgers and birds, and also mythical creatures.” Trawling through designs on social media can be helpful in choosing an artist, if a little overwhelming: “Work out if you want something bold and bright or soft and subtle,” says Sidgwick, “then look online and see what kind of styles there are and who does those designs in your town.” Be prepared to travel for the right artist, Sidgwick adds.Research the artist’s credentials, says Casey Marie, a tattooist and owner ofSeven Stonesin Bristol. “Ask if they have a licence and insurance.” Find out about cleanliness levels by popping into the studio or checking online videos and reviews: “I always open my needles in front of clients so they know that they are fresh.” Also consider the cost and be clear about the likely price upfront: some artists, including Casey Marie, charge per artwork, while others, like Sidgwick, charge by the hour. Most will ask for a non-refundable deposit on booking.Think about what technique you want to go for. Jemima Keziahis a non-electric or hand-poke tattooist atCrawe Tattooin Leeds: “Instead of the machine moving the needle, I do it with my hands. So it is closer to the traditional way of tattooing. It is a bit slower, gentler and more mindful.”Trust your artist to develop a unique design“I always ask people to send me plenty of reference pictures to make sure that we are on the same page,” says Keziah, who is known for her mermaids and natural designs. “The clearer you are about what you want, the less room there is for error. No amount of detail is too much. But it is also important to give your artist a bit of breathing room.”View image in fullscreenDavid Beckham’s angel, by Louis Molloy, surrounded by the names of his children.Photograph: Ian Kington/AFP/Getty ImagesLouis Molloy ofMiddleton Tattoo Studio, in Manchester, is the artist behind the guardian angel on David Beckham’s back: “He gave me a verbal description of what he wanted, and from that I did a sketch, and he was like, ‘Yeah, that’s it.’ At first, he had it done without the wings; he had them put on a year or so later. It is often likened to a crucifixion pose, but I describe it more as an Olympic diver when they stand on the board just before they dive.”Classic tattoo parlours have flash sheets – collections of readymade drawings – displayed on the walls or in folders; they are “usually not customised, and not necessarily drawn by someone at the shop”, explains Sidgwick. “These days flash is less prevalent, in favour of custom-drawn design, but it is still a mainstay of old-school shops.”Sometimes Sidgwick invites clients in for a consultation: “They usually have a specific idea and want me to translate it into my style. Some of them are really elaborate, with a huge backstory, and they are trying to express something from their life or about themselves, and memorialise a person, pet or something important to them. We’ll talk through their ideas to see what would work best in the space they have allocated for it, to see how it would actually look compared with the idea.”Give the design serious thought“Ask yourself: will I still think that this image is as cool 20 years down the line?” says Molloy, who says he became a tattooist because “it was an instant membership to the bad boy club.” Casey Marie, meanwhile, recommends sitting on a design for as long as possible: “Use it as a screensaver on your phone, or put it in a WhatsApp group and let them rip it apart.” She adds that most tattooists will be happy to make changes until the needle hits the skin. “I will move the stencil 100 times if I have to and if it’s still not right, we can come back another day.”Go for something meaningfulThis is a good idea for a first tattoo. “Try to think of a memory that you know is not going to change,” says Casey Marie. Her first tattoo was a word her dad used in a letter to her that made her feel safe. “I was really small, but it stayed with me.”Be cautious about passing trends“If you want it to be original, don’t pick something off Pinterest because everybody will have it,” says Sidgwick. Molloy has seen trends come and go since he opened his studio in 1981, “like tribal tattoos in the 90s, which massively fell out of favour. Then it was the religious stuff that I did on Beckham and co. Then there was this vogue for pocket watches, with the time set to when their kid was born.” It is OK to nod to other artists’ designs, says Molloy – his Beckham tattoo has made it on to many more backs. “I never had any issue with other tattooists copying my work. It is almost an unwritten thing with tattooists that you plagiarise people’s work. You take it as a compliment, because as they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.” But remember to “go with your heart”, says Sidgwick. “Don’t copy your friends.”Think carefully about how big and whereGo small at first, the tattooists agree, but “set the size of the tattoo to the space”, says Sidgwick. “Don’t get some tiny thing floating around in the middle of your thigh, because it will look silly. Maybe a wrist or ankle for a smaller design.”“With little ones, think about placement,” Keziah agrees. “Don’t just slap it somewhere really visible, like your forearm because you want to see it. Those ones right in the middle of big visible places can get in the way of bigger stuff if you decide to get more.”Tattoos on your hands will fadeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christophe Pierre Suant/Alamy“All tattoos, irrespective of who does them or how good they are, will deteriorate,” says Molloy. “It is a natural process, but if you do them on places like the hands, that process accelerates because you use your hands all the time. You have to tell people this and they either take the advice or they don’t, but if you’ve told them, then at least they are making an informed decision.”Beckham ignored some of Molloy’s guidance.Consider how you would cover it if necessaryTattoos are much more mainstream than they used to be, so this is less of a consideration for the workplace now: “Loads of teachers have them,” says Keziah. “They don’t even have one or two – they are covered in tattoos. I never had any teachers with tattoos growing up. If I did, it would have been really quite inspiring. So it doesn’t have to be hidden, but maybe somewhere that could it be hidden if needed.”Be honest about your pain threshold“Tattooing is painful, but I describe it as a manageable pain,” says Molloy. “Probably the nearest thing I could equate it to is when you have sunburn – that hot, burning feeling. Certain areas can be more painful, like your ribs, stomach and joints, but on fleshy parts, it is very manageable.” If you are anxious about the pain or needles, your tattooist should be able to reassure you. “I ask clients, ‘Are you squeamish in any way?’ If they don’t like needles I will turn my back to them when I’m getting stuff, so they can’t see what I’m doing,” says Casey Marie.Avoid names of partners“I’ve covered so many names,” says Sidgwick. “If you want a name, go with your kid’s because that is less likely to change.”If a tattooist tries to talk you out of something, you should probably listen“Sometimes you get people who want stuff and you just think, that’s not gonna work,” says Molloy, who has turned a few people away on this basis. “Years later, the client comes back in and says: ‘I really appreciate you talking me out of that.’”“If I know something is going to look really bad, I don’t want to be the one to do it,” says Sidgwick. “I’ve also had people ask me for some awful things. I won’t do anything hate-related. I don’t do genital tattoos. Just certain things I know would be a problem. I don’t want to go there.”If in doubt, stick to the classicsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Horst Friedrichs/Alamy“For something a bit timeless, go traditional,” says Sidgwick. “You can’t go wrong with a rose, a skull or an anchor.” “If you are going for colours,” adds Keziah, “reds, greens, browns seem to age quite well. There is a reason why people are still getting trad tattoos 100-plus years after they started in the western world.”On the day, make sure you are well preparedExfoliate and moisturise the skin well beforehand, says Casey Marie, and keep hydrated, all of which will make the process less painful and your tattoo will heal more quickly. Don’t drink caffeine before a tattoo as it can make you more sensitive and fidgety, and make sure you have eaten well to avoid your adrenaline spiking, which can cause you to pass out. But don’t worry if you do – sometimes even tattoo artists succumb, as Casey Marie did during her last tattoo: “The lady put the stencil on my tummy and I fainted.”Pack wiselyUnless you are going for something tiny, it will probably take longer than you think, so be prepared. “I take a bottle of water, a fizzy drink and a packed lunch,” says Casey Marie. “Snacks are your best friend when you get a tattoo because you’re not going to feel hungry as adrenaline suppresses your appetite. Headphones, if you’re not necessarily comfortable chatting. A phone charger. I always take an extra jumper and fluffy socks, because, again, as the adrenaline spikes, you’ll get really hot and then really cold, and that is when your body can go into shock.” Most importantly, she says, don’t forget your ID – passport or driving licence; in the UK, you must be over 18 to have a tattoo.Tell the tattooist if you have allergies“I offer a patch test if you’ve had a previous allergy to ink and are concerned about it, but a reaction is relatively rare,” says Casey Marie. “When you fill out a consent form, state any allergies. Some people are allergic to citrus and that is in some of the products we use, so it is about knowing that and then looking at my setup and finding a backup.”Don’t turn up drunk or ill“My shop is opposite a pub,” says Casey Marie, so a few drinkers have given it a go, “but from an insurance point of view, they can’t consent because they are intoxicated.” It’s also unwise to get tattooed while tipsy because, “if you’ve got alcohol in your system, you tend to bleed more and the more you bleed, the more your body will push out the ink, so [the colour] will heal lighter.” She will also turn away anyone who is obviously unwell: “Your body is already fighting something, so it is probably not a good idea that we are trying to get it to heal a tattoo.”View image in fullscreenAn artist gets to work during the Brighton Tattoo Convention last month.Photograph: Alishia Abodunde/Getty ImagesGive the artist as much notice as possible if you can’t keep the appointment: “Everyone gets ill – that’s life – and I’m as lenient as I can be when it happens last minute,” says Sidgwick. “More often than not, I’ll take the financial hit for that day and rebook them for a future date. But I do have overheads and it can hit me hard if several people no-show or get sick in a week.” If you have had medical treatment for something like cancer, check with your doctor if it is OK to have a tattoo, advises Casey Marie.Don’t be afraid to speak upTell the tattooist how you are feeling – whether you need a break or want a change to the design, says Casey Marie. “Don’t be afraid to ask: can we move it? Can we do this? There are some artists who make you feel inconvenient if you ask to move it. But the chances are, if you don’t, and you go away unhappy, we will be more disappointed that we’ve marked you permanently with something you don’t love. That’s the kind of thing that keeps me awake at night.”Take good care of your body artYou may leave feeling slightly woozy and “tattoo drunk” as Casey Marie calls it, which is why she sends aftercare advice by email rather than talking clients through the process in the chair. Aftercare involves applying a second skin or clingfilm, and lots of coconut oil or cocoa butter. Submerging the tattooed area in water – eg baths and swimming, along with saunas – should be avoided until the scabbing stage is over. Resist the temptation to scratch, as it can damage the tattoo. Instead, “slap it as much as you like,” she says.After a tattoo has healed, “it is about putting effective moisturiser on your skin and using a high-factor sun cream because UV light will fade tattoos and it doesn’t do your skin any favours,” says Molloy. “I have some clients who are meticulous about that – and you can tell – and some who couldn’t care less. If you’ve got a really nice piece of work and then get heavily suntanned, you’re going to destroy it.”Tattoo regrets? There are optionsLaser removal works by breaking down the ink into fragments so that your body flushes out the pigments. After Molloy appeared on the 00s reality television showLondon Ink, he became “an unelected ambassador for my industry and I had two armfuls of really shit tattoos. So I had them all lasered off, then I had them all re-tattooed. That process took four years from start to finish. I’ve now got two Japanese-themed sleeves that I’m very happy with.” You can also have a different design tattooed over an existing one. Black ink is the hardest to laser or cover. “A panther is a classic for covering up,” says Sidgwick.Keziah adds: “I think it is liberating getting a tattoo and going off it because you learn that it is not really a big deal. I am as happy with my tattoos as I am happy with my body in general. Even the ones that I have gone off a bit, they are a part of who I was at the time.”A tattoo can help you to feel differently about yourselfTattooing isn’t for everyone, especially not on the face. Casey Marie has several there, which she says means people cross the road to avoid her, but she loves them: “I didn’t love the size of my forehead, and it distracts from it. I think for a lot of people, tattooing can be a bit of a self-love journey.”Explore more on these topicsTattoosThe expertsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Labour’s “new deal” employment programme was its 1997 flagship. Now those lessons, ignored and trashed in the Tory years, are being revived. WhileLabourwas good at scrupulously monitoring the results of its social programmes, the Tories ruled by their gut instincts.Faced with high unemployment and shocking numbers of youths who had been dumped and neglected, Labour’s new deal for young people worked. By 2002, it could rightly claim thevirtual eradication of youth long-term unemployment.I followed the programme in detail, sitting in on jobcentre interviews, chasing results. How was it done? A total change of attitude and approach, from punitive to encouraging. Employment staff were retrained and put on a higher grade, becoming personal advisers to help remove obstacles to working. They offered 18- to 24-year-olds four well-organised options: a further education course, work on environmental projects or in a voluntary organisation, or a subsidised job with employers given £60 a week to take them on. “No fifth option” was the backstop sanction. About 339,000 long-term unemployed young peoplefound work by 2001. Deep distrust of the Department for Work and Pensions faded, as people discovered genuine help. There were other new deals for the over-50s, disabled people, and a particularly successfulone for lone parents. Jobcentres were transformed from The Full Monty’s bolted-down plastic chairs and shouted interviews behind scratched Perspex to open, less threatening places.But by 2009, in the aftermath of the bankers’ crash, nearly 1 million young peoplelanded in jobcentres. Labour, determined not to see them become a lost generation, dashed to set up the future jobs fund. Employers were paid £6,500 to take an extra young person for six months, who were paid at least the minimum wage,creating 105,000 jobs. (A local panel, including unions, ensured the jobs were new, not substitutes.) I watched Jon, a depressed 19-year-old without qualifications who had despaired of work, amazed as his adviser in a Brighton jobcentre showed him all kinds of good jobs suddenly available. Cost-benefit analyses found people spent70 fewer days on benefitsand 43% were estimated to be in work after completing the programme – a high rate compared with other schemes, and well worth the high upfront cost. But the great George Osborne axe fell on this, as it did on so much else.Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, has for a long time talked up this approach: she knows the research well and, bludgeoning the Treasury with the evidence, has reportedlyextracted as much as £1bn for supporting disabled peopleinto work, as well as the1 million “neets”(young people aged 18-24 not in education, employment or training). That is a significant sum to spend on support programmes, say employment experts. It should create high-quality schemes. Kendall always promised more personal help by easing work coaches’ caseloads. She talks of the need to de-risk taking a job, so disabled people can trust they have the option to try a job but return at once to benefits if it doesn’t work out. Employers need to be more flexible with varying states of illness. She talks of no longer wasting time by harassing those who will never work, while neglecting many who could and want to. But here’s the hitch: actual cash returns will take time to score on the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) and Treasury balance sheets.The great question is: how big an axe will fall on disability benefits whenshe delivers her green papernext week? And, more importantly, how fast? Over time, if schemes work and if the economy perks up, then reducing the number of claims and their costs is possible. But cuts before that success will be brutal. What’s more, aseconomist Jonathan Portes points out, OBR reports show its forecast disability cuts never actually add up. For example, introducing Pip was supposed to be a cut, replacing the disability living allowance; OBR duly scored it, but Pip costs ballooned. Even in the time of truly vicious jobcentre persecution of claimants with sanctions,punishment didn’t work. Chivvying may urge some people into work, but research shows it has thecontrary effect on those with mental ill-health.Squeezing over here bursts out elsewhere, in a half-starved system. With basic unemployment pay at a sub-survivable £393.45 a month, anyone out of work for long is in a miserable state, and likely to describe their condition in medicalised terms. That’s not cheating; it’s a true expression when they apply for disability benefits that lift them above starvation. The country is sicker than it was, and sicker than its neighbours, physically and mentally, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) reports this week, with nearly 1 million more people ondisability benefits than pre-pandemic. It’s not imaginary, they say, as it matches the rise in “deaths of despair”, from drugs, drink and suicide.Jobs arefar harsher than they once were, Prof Ben Baumberg Geiger reports – physically and emotionally more stressful, with less personal control. Efficiency savings have killed off “light work” for frailer people. What Labour does may help: a better NHS, less monstrous gig-working conditions and a better spirit of care. But any savage axe to living standards of hard-up disabled people wouldn’t encourage that. Labour would face a hefty backlash.Nor will voters approve, with 53% saying these benefits are too mean or about right, and only 26% saying they are too high.No wonder disability benefits costs terrify the Treasury, and they are due torise by £35bnin four years time. But here are alternative facts, equally true, if you shake the statistics kaleidoscope another way.The overall proportion of spending on benefits for working age adults and children is similar to 20 years ago, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation told me. And here’s anothershake of the kaleidoscopefrom the IFS: the UK’s spending on working-age health-related benefits is comparable to that of other similar countries.There are no easy billions to be had from the benefits budget, though much reform is needed within it. Look elsewhere: Starmerabolishing NHS Englandshould render savings from this costly duplicate. Whitehall should shed extra staff acquired in Covid. But there are few painless options for large sums, as all the economic choices are terrible. But of all unpalatable ways for Labour to break its election promises, either by borrowing or by taxing more, the worst choice of all would be cuts and austerity, slicing deeper into public services.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That proves our movement is workingValerie CostaI’ve always believed the people are powerful. Now we know the world’s richest man does tooThu 13 Mar 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 13 Mar 2025 08.16 EDTShareOn Saturday morning, I woke up to a nightmare of notifications. On Sunday, it got worse.Elon Muskhad tweeted and amplified inflammatory lies about me and Tesla Takedown, a growing national grassroots movement peacefullyprotestingatTeslashowrooms that I’m proudly a part of. Musk tweeted: “Costa is committing crimes.”As a longtime local activist and organizer in Seattle, I’m accustomed to some conflict with powerful forces. The intention of the Tesla Takedown movement is to make a strong public stand against the tech oligarchy behind theTrump administration’s cruel and illegal actions, and to encourage Americans tosell their Teslas and dump the company’s stock. Protests like these – peaceful, locally organized, and spreading across the world – are at the heart of free speech in a democracy and a cornerstone of US political traditions. So it’s telling that the response from so-called “free speech absolutist” Musk has been to single out individuals – and spread lies about us and our movement. The harassment that has followed his post has been frightening.It’s also proof that theTeslaTakedown campaign is working.I’d like to address the lies spread about me by the world’s richest man and X users. I have not committed any crimes. I have not been funded by ActBlue, or by George Soros – that name is simply a tired antisemitic dog whistle. I’m not inspired by Luigi Mangione nor have I ever said that I am. I am not encouraging any vandalism. Nobody is getting paid to come to these protests. I am not the leader of Tesla Takedown. In fact, no one is.If we can’t show our opposition to what the government is doing, then we’re living in a dictatorshipHere is the truth: Tesla Takedown is a completely decentralized movement with hundreds of protests taking place around the globe, drawing many thousands of people out of their homes and on to the public sidewalks to stand up for programs that support poor people, older people, veterans, the sick. Out of care and concern for others – a foreign concept to those currently in power – people are offering what they can to help. I’ve offered to schlep supplies, and helped someone find a bullhorn. The environmentally focused Seattle organization I’m a part of, Troublemakers, hosts a map where other people and groups can post the locations of forthcoming demonstrations. Troublemakers has about $3,500 in its bank accounts. All of this is a bare-bones, low-budget, people-powered movement – which is exactly why Musk is afraid of it, and casting about to find a villain.Trump calls Tesla boycott ‘illegal’ and says he’s buying one to support MuskRead moreThere are currently 91 Tesla Takedown protests planned across the world this coming weekend, and there will be more the weekend after that. If there isn’t one at the Tesla showroom nearest you, you can start one just by showing up with some friends or family, maybe making some cardboard signs. This exercise of our fundamental first amendment right to peaceably assemble is giving an effective outlet to the outrage this administration has caused here and around the globe, and we’re making a difference. Tesla stock has fallenprecipitously, losing a quarter of its value in the months since the protests began. On Wednesday, JP Morgan analysts told Quartz: “We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly.”Donald Trumpeven got on X this week to defensively claim thathe’ll be buying a Teslato support his good friend Musk. More and more people are unloading the company’s stock and selling their cars. The movement is growing and the administration is taking notice. When enough of us come together to do what we can, this is what effective opposition can be.Musk’s false accusations against me won’t stop this movement, because he is inflicting real harm on the American public and people around the world. In fact, Musk and Trump are the ones committing crimes. Just this week they have announced their intentions to slashsocial security,Medicare, unemployment insurance andfood stamps. They aregutting public institutions,stripping environmental protections,destabilizing the economyandpeople’s lives. Musk is openly and gleefullyfiring federal workersen masse and dismantling programs that serve millions at home and across the globe. They’ve ignored multiple judicial orders, and refused to restart payments that they were ordered to. The unofficial agency Musk leads, the “department of government efficiency”, is digging into systems and pushing out public servants, when its own staff hasn’t received so much as a background check. Musk’s conflicts of interest are piling up without any disclosures. All of the programs this administration is destroying are paid for by people like you and me through our taxes. Tesla – a billion-dollar company –shelled out zero income tax last year. Justice through government processes will be slow, if it comes at all.It might be a small consolation, but Elon Musk is getting poorer by the day | John NaughtonRead moreIf we can’t show our opposition to what the government is doing, we are living in a dictatorship. If we are criminalized for calling out the rich and powerful for their illegal actions, that is a dictatorship. I don’t want to live in a dictatorship.Make no mistake, it’s scary to be personally called out by the richest man in the world on the platform he owns. It’s scary to be targeted by a seemingly endless number of his devoted trolls and bots. To be doxxed, to have one’s life pored over and exposed, to be smeared, attacked and falsely accused. It’s scarier still when the FBI director gets tagged into the threads and asked to investigate. But I’m not backing down – and even if I did, it wouldn’t make a dent in this movement. Hundreds if not thousands of people have participated in the ways that I have.The truth is, the people are powerful. I’ve always believed that.

Hertfordshire zoo offers a World of Dinosaurs, there is the “roarsome” theatre show Dinosaur World: Live, a dinosaur-themed park in Norfolk called ROARR!, Dinosaur World in Torquay, Dinosaur Park near Swansea, Dino Park in Dumfries – the list is as long as the neck of a brontosaurus.Parents will have noticed that unicorns are equally ubiquitous, and marketed exclusively and equally extensively to little girls, usually swathed in pink. Historically, unicorns are a symbol of purity, grace and innocence; their horns are said to be able to heal people and purify poisoned water.There is no evidence that unicorns ever existed – at leastnot those creaturesof the popular imagination – and dinosaurs aren’t around much lately either; it’s almost as if someone doesn’t want our children to become interested in animals that are actually alive.I know children who can list 10 different types of dinosaur but don’t know the difference between anAfrican elephantand an Indian elephant. I know children who believe unicorns are real, but don’t realise that as many as 1,500 ponies live wild onDartmoor. Children go to bed hugging a toy unicorn, but have never sat on the back of a pony. How many of our children are going to want to grow up to be naturalists or environmentalists if they aren’t taught about real animals?My message to parents, grandparents, aunties, uncles, brothers and sisters is: if you want to introduce our tiny humans to animals, please buy them a book about aardvarks, brown kiwi, ring-tailed lemurs, crested porcupines or hippopotamuses. Across Europe, brown bears are beingsuccessfully reintroduced; what a thrilling piece of news to hook in a child’s interest.View image in fullscreenA pair of Eurasian beavers.Photograph: Arterra Picture Library/AlamyAnd it doesn’t have to be bears.Beavers are fantastic little mammalsto learn about: they have gorgeous tails, build little dome-shaped dens called “lodges”, gnaw down trees, build dams, reroute rivers, and create whole new ecosystems. Under anew government licence scheme,they are being returned to waterways in England – so it’s not wildly misleading to teach children that, if they are patient, they might see one swimming along with a stick.There are other great stories about British wildlife to tell: some naturalists, for example, hope to see the reintroduction of the beautiful grey wolf to our shores. There is a role available, in the future, for the first person to successfully reintroduce a pair of wolves to Britain, ashas been doneacross Europe. Maybe that child is alive now. So if you are a parent, please talk to your child about wolves.If they want monsters, tell them about theGila monsterthat lives in Mexico and the south-western US. If they want magic, tell them about chameleons that are alive now in Madagascar and can change colour. Tell them about beautifulpeacock spiders, whose eight eyes are so big that they take up almost their entire heads.The awe-inspiring intelligence of octopuses – podcastRead moreIf children become curious about insects, they won’t grow up with a fear of them. If you show children how intelligent octopuses are, when they are adults maybe they will choose not to eat them. If you tell them stories of orange orangutans then maybe as adults they will want to visit Borneo and play a part in protecting the rainforests – or at least they will avoid buyingpalm oil. If you want to start nearer home, maybe you know someone who has hedgehogs in their garden, snuffling around at dusk?I’m begging those of you that are looking after the next generation: put a picture of a bottlenose dolphin on the wall, or a moose, a porcupine, a gorilla, or a penguin. If you want to take care of the environmentalists of tomorrow, please choose any book, lunchbox, T-shirt, fluffy toy or “experience” that is not about dinosaurs or unicorns.

The PM wants effective, dynamic administration that voters will believe inThu 13 Mar 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 13 Mar 2025 07.44 EDTShareWhen Keir Starmer’s government finally arrives on the threshold of the next general election, due in 2028-29, Labour’s hopes will not rest on the battlefields of Ukraine, however well-judged Starmer’s diplomacy is proving to be in that conflict right now. Labour’s long-term fate will instead be determined here at home, in the way all elections almost always are.As so often, the outcome in four years’ time will be decided by whether voters feel more secure then than they did in the past. If they do, they may vote Labour. If they do not, they may turn to the Conservatives and to Reform UK. The government’s preoccupation with this crossroads explains why Downing Street wants the prime minister’sspeech on the civil serviceon Thursday to be seen as a defining choice of direction.In his speech, Starmer is expected to set out plans for the most radical restructuring of the British state in decades. The plans are said to be extensive, challenging old assumptions of the right and the left, and ranging far beyond the old argument about the size of the state that dominated British politics in the 40 years after Margaret Thatcher came to power. Many previous reform strategies, most recently from Michael Gove, have fizzled out. With his large majority, however, Starmer is particularly well placed to turn his proposals into reality.Starmer’s central contention is that, although the civil service today is larger than ever, it is far less effective and trusted. His spotlight ranges well beyond Whitehall.More than 5 million peopleare now employed in central and local government service, including the NHS: around a million more than in 2000. Partly because of Covid,four times as manywork in NHS England and the department of health compared with 2010, when waiting lists were shortest andpublic satisfaction highest.Cutting numbers, however, is only one of the expected Starmer plans. The prime minister will also announce new incentives to get“failing” civil servants to quit, a thinning-out of top jobs in Whitehall, aslowdown in outsourcingfrom government departments to regulators, a reorganisation of NHS England, and a big boost for data roles and AI.‘Country first, party second,’ says Starmer. So why menace Labour members who actually believe that? | Polly ToynbeeRead moreThe advance billing of Starmer’s address on Thursday as a speech on civil service reform may have served to obscure its wider significance. The reality, though, is that it is about something truly epic. It is about whetherLabourcan make 21st-century British government work at all.Until the speech itself is delivered, the key text for understanding what Starmer thinks he is doing remains the1,500-word letterthat he wrote to cabinet ministers last month. That letter, which clearly reflects the approach of the No 10 chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, was a call to arms for the remainder of this parliament. It said the old ways have failed and are too slow. Politicians have become “complacent about the role of the market and the state”. The public is “hungry for change and disruption”. The letter ends with a demand for “wholesale reform” to provide security and renewal.Today’s intervention needs to be understood in that ambitious context. It is meant as big-picture stuff. It is not solely about changing Whitehall, civil service numbers or AI, though it is partly about all of that. At its root, though, the speech is about the imperative to change how government works in the new technological world. This was something that Dominic Cummings attempted from the centre-right after 2019. The aim this time is from the centre left, to make the state better at doing good for those who rely on it – which, in one way or another, is most of us.There should be no dispute that this is necessary work.A YouGov survey last autumnfound that just 6% thought UK public services were in a good state, with 74% judging them in a bad one. Bad management was seen as the number one cause, not lack of spending.Part of this is down to Brexit, which, far from cutting red tape as pretended, has actually increased it. Covid provided another extreme pressure. Yet, with civil service numbers now more than115,000 higher than before Brexit, there is no compelling sign that more civil servants leads to better outcomes. Better performance management in the civil service is a no-brainer when the public finances are tight, as they are today.Government sources are adamant that – despite the “project chainsaw” label others have given the initiative – it is wrong to equate what Starmer is saying with Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” in Washington. “We are not Doge. We are not wielding a chainsaw. We are not anti-state,” one said. “This is a centre-left Labour government. It believes in the power of the state to make lives better. But the state has to change. Civil servants need to realise that they will never have a more civil-service-supporting set of ministers than they do today.”This is the line that both Starmer and McSweeney take. The influential cabinet minister Pat McFadden also made these arguments on hisweekend media round. But the test of any policy and any speech is whether it can be put into practice as smoothly as possible and whether it produces desirable results for citizens. Here, the government faces big problems.Not least of these is the sheer amount of publicity given to Musk and to Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, for their iconic slash-and-burn,chainsaw-brandishing approachto government. Milei and Musk are opposed to the state, while Labour says it is not. Yet it can be all too easy to equate them, as even the Labour Together thinktank, which is close to McSweeney, has now done.Even if the parallels are fundamentally false, as McFadden argued this weekend, such comparisons can stick. They can be a gift to campaigners against the policy, including in the unions. These are deeply emotive issues, and for good reasons.Nevertheless, everyone, including the unions, also knows that the world has changed since the 20th century. The private sector is being transformed by new technologies bringing new forms of product manufacture, delivery, work and consumption. The public realm cannot sit by and pretend it is unaffected, or that there is some magical way of recreating the past.Starmer’s letter to the cabinet last month was run through with two ideas: the case for disruption of old approaches, and the public’s craving for better security. Disruption and security are not natural bedfellows. Starmer’s challenge is to prove that they can be. If he succeeds, Labour can look forward to the next election with something like cautious optimism. If he fails, the future will surely belong to others.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsCivil serviceOpinionLabourKeir StarmerNHSMorgan McSweeneyHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

I’m tired of it. But there’s one bit I still love. That’s when I find myself right bang in the middle of town early in the morning. I feel the same way about all the other cities in which I ply my trade: Birmingham, Cardiff and Manchester, mainly. At about 6am, all cities have a similar character.I write this in a cafe on Old Compton Street in Soho, in central London, at 6.30am. Here more than anywhere, it feels as though you’re in the eye of a storm. There aren’t many people about because the people, millions of them, are all jammed up on the roads and crammed on to public transport, getting in each other’s way, trying to get here. So for another hour or so we have it to ourselves. “We” being the early starters and a few late finishers.It’s a bit of a club, which feels more exclusive the earlier you’re here before the lightweights turn upMost of us are bleary of eye. Some are already hard at it, mainly working with their hands, building things, cleaning things, getting ready to sell things. Then there are the thrusters, besuited, full of a different purpose. And distressingly there are always the desperate too, wandering – or still sleeping on – the streets. The hopeful and the hopeless, respectively, move quickly and slowly.It’s a bit of a club, which feels more exclusive the earlier you’re here before the lightweights turn up. In the meantime we all exchange looks that, even if they say nothing more profound than “God, early, isn’t it?”, still communicate a togetherness.I have favourite early-morning memories from each city I work in. In Manchester it’s the dozen or so builders I saw next to a site near Piccadilly Gardens, standing in a circle, in hi-vis and hard hats, doing some warmup stretches. In Cardiff it’s going to use the toilet in a massive, deserted Marks & Spencer. There wasn’t a soul on the shopfloor but Rose Royce were playing, singing the saddest pop song ever: “You abandoned me; love don’t live here anymore.” I imagined a newly heartbroken employee had put it on. And in Birmingham, there’s The Friendliest Man In The World, who runs the breakfast cafe next to New Street station. Always a joy, the earlier the better. It’s always special everywhere.Until everyone else turns up and, in the nicest possible way, rather spoils it all.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLife and styleOpinionLondoncommentShareReuse this content"

It locks homeowners, especially those in flats, into an exploitative, serf-like relationship with the freeholder who owns the property and management rights to it.The freeholder can exploit this power imbalance and, with the backing of the law, coerce the leaseholder to pay extortionate sums in ground rent and service charges. The former is a payment conferring no benefit or service to leaseholders, it is owed as tribute to the freeholder’s superior legal rights. Historically a trivial amount, ground rent has been gamed in recent years to extort more money from individual leaseholders. So destructive are ground rents that in 2022,parliament passed a lawbanning them on new homes.The freeholder also appoints a building management company to handle maintenance, funded by a service charge levied on flat owners. In practice, this can lead to conflicts of interest and exorbitant fees. If leaseholders fail to meet demands for a payment above £350 they can face their home being claimed without compensation. The threat of forfeiture forces leaseholders to pay inflated fees – sometimes for services never received.I’ve seen leaseholder exploitation at first-hand.My mum’s service charges to her freeholder have risen to an obscene £33,000 annually, as the no-frills building deteriorates and homes are rendered unsaleable.Hamptonsfound that in 2023 alone, leaseholders in England and Wales paid a punishing £7.6bn in service charges. A 2011 study by Which? estimated leaseholders were being overcharged by £700m every year through inflated service charges. A recent governmentimpact assessmentconsidered this figure to be too low due to growth of the sector. Growing awareness of leasehold’s exploitative nature has widened the price gap between houses and flats. This gap is now at a30-year highwith buyers unwilling to become financial hostages.The government’s newcommonhold white paperpromises to ban leasehold for future flats. New flats would be “commonhold”, a democratic structure whereby each flat-owner owns the freehold to their unit and, through a company, owns a share of the land with their neighbours. Commonholders would appoint their own managing agent and collectively decide how their money is spent. They would be free from ground rents and the risk of forfeiture.However, the government has not committed to providing an assured pathway to commonhold for the millions, like my mum, already in leasehold flats. The proposals expect leaseholders to acquire the freehold before converting to commonhold. However, freehold purchase is extortionate, often costing tens of thousands of pounds a household. The government has suggested this won’t change, stating “the cost is likely to still be significant”. Labour has ruled out government-backed loans for commonhold conversion, a majorLaw Commission recommendation.View image in fullscreenA block of flats in London.Photograph: Toddlerstock/AlamyBeyond cost, many leaseholders are blocked from buying their freehold due torestrictions imposedby the Tories in the 1990s. Labour appears set to replicate these exclusions in their rules on who can acquire their freehold and convert to commonhold. These include the lack of a statutory right for leaseholders to retrospectively buy their freehold share if they did not participate in the original freehold buy-out with their neighbours, either because they couldn’t afford to or hadn’t yet bought into the development. Another exclusion harms leaseholders in flats structurally connected to commercial premises such as a shop.Under the proposals, even qualifying leaseholders who secure majority support for commonholdwon’t be totally free of leasehold. Currently, the process requires 100% support from the leaseholders, lenders and freeholder. Although the government signals it will reduce the participation threshold to 50%, and ensure that only leaseholders decide, pure commonhold will only be secured if every single leaseholder votes and pays for it upfront.Given that this is near impossible, commonhold will coexist with leasehold within individual buildings, potentially resulting in costly administration, disputes and even litigation. Why adopt a policy that the government itself recognises “might prove worse than the leasehold it replaced”?The government’s half-baked intervention risks creating a new two-tier market, divided between shiny new commonhold flats and the legacy stock of leasehold debt traps. Elsewhere in the world, including in Scotland, flat-owners enjoy democratic self-rule without third-party landlords; it’s time we extended these rights to the rest of the UK – and that means commonhold for the many, not just the new.Harry Scoffin is a housing campaigner and the founder of Free LeaseholdersExplore more on these topicsLeaseholdOpinionPropertyHousingCommunitiesLabourEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

Or is there more benefit in allying with Donald Trump?Thu 13 Mar 2025 06.13 EDTLast modified on Thu 13 Mar 2025 11.11 EDTShareAt this stage of the crisis, it is important to be clear-sighted. The US-Ukraine meeting in Jeddah was a damage-control operation.Both parties reset relationsthat had been damaged, largely by Washington’s impatience. The US reversed its previous decisions in exchange for something Ukraine was ready to provide anyway: privileged access to Ukraine’s natural resource wealth and a willingness to start a peace process.It is encouraging to see renewed US-Ukraine dialogue to end the war.As Churchill said, the only thing worse than fighting with allies is fighting without them.The public mugging in the Oval Office, calling Volodymyr Zelenskyy a dictator and the pause in military and intelligence support were hard to fathom. Ukrainians wondered why President Trump was putting the blame and the pressure on the victim, and protecting the aggressor. Trump’s “beautiful” deal involved bullying the weaker and reassuring the stronger. He finds it more natural to put pressure on allies, be it Ukraine or Canada, and relax it on adversaries.This week’s meeting in Jeddah may have been an effort by the White House to re-balance the pressure scale and expose Vladimir Putin’s real intentions. By the beginning of this week the US hadlifted the pause on intelligence-sharingand resumed security assistance. This intelligence is critical for defending Ukrainian cities from the nightly aerial bombings. US satellite images and communication systems sustain several targeting and air-defence platforms. The night the delegations met in Saudi Arabia, the port ofOdesa was hit, killing four people in a strike on a grain vessel. Ukraine is waging a defensive war and perhaps the White House has understood that the best leverage over Putin is powerful and well-equipped Ukrainian armed forces.Nobody wants peace more than Ukraine.When President Trump was accusingZelenskyy of not wanting peace, it must have pleased the Kremlin immensely. Trump was reciting Russian talking points. The US-Ukraine meeting dispelled that falsehood and demonstrated Kyiv’s constructive and cooperative position.View image in fullscreenIryna Petrochenko looks out from her damaged apartment in Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine, after a Russian missile attack killed one and wounded nine on 12 March 2025.Photograph: Paula Bronstein/Getty ImagesThe joint statementpoints out that “Ukraine expressed a readiness to accept the US proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation”.So what will be Putin’s move? I think his agreement on a ceasefire will be driven by two factors: whether his country can stay in the fight for much longer and the terms of the arrangement imposed onUkraine. Putin may decide that the cost of losing a seat at the superpower table with the US president outweighs any benefits of conquering a few more villages in eastern Ukraine. Putin may, therefore, settle for a ceasefire that secures his interim gains: he gets his “grey zone” with a weakened Ukraine outside Nato and an unresolved war that can be reignited at any time. This would mean Ukraine would need to continue to spend a huge portion of its national budget on defence, straining its economy and struggling to deliver on the EU integration agenda. Putin, meanwhile, gets a secure “land bridge” connecting Crimea to Russia via the coast of the Azov Sea.A ceasefire would bring Russia much-needed economic relief and buy time for a military reconstitution. Given Ukraine’s persistent destruction of Russian oil refineries, it will need time to rebuild those too. For this, the lifting of energy-related western sanctions will be key to get new equipment in. And a pause allows for regrouping of manpower, since Ukraine has killed or woundednearly 80% of the ground troops that Russia has mobilised for this war. Russia has struggled to take large chunks of Ukraine because of a deficit of men and equipment.The final incentive to pause the war may come from Putin’s confidence in his ability to wreck Ukraine from within. Recent US insistence on elections and calls for Zelenskyy to resign are also part of the Kremlin’s plans.Putin is determined to destroy Zelesnkyy’s government. The grey zone scenario enables the forces of chaos, fuelled by disinformation, to damage pro-democratic parties. The blame for this neither-war-nor-peace situation will fall on Zelenskyy. Issues of war trauma, lack of foreign investment and new outflows of people when travel restrictions are lifted make a ceasefire risky for Ukraine. A ceasefire that doesn’t lead to a just settlement will worsen regional security in the long run.View image in fullscreenRussian artist Alexey Sergienko’s artwork titled The Peace (2017) on display in St Petersburg, Russia, 12 March 2025.Photograph: Anatoly Maltsev/EPAUkraine may not “have all the cards”, but nor is it bluffing when it says it will not capitulate to Moscow’s demands.Support for Zelenskyy remains high. Despite its own difficulties with military personnel, only 38% of Ukrainians believe Kyiv should agree to relinquish Ukraine’s sovereign territory to Russia. This is mainly driven by the understanding that Russia is waging a genocidal war to destroy the Ukrainian nation –87% of Ukrainians believe Moscow will not stop at the current frontlines.If the US manages to curtail Russian appetites and pressure it to approach a ceasefire as the start of a genuine settlement, peace has a chance. If not, it will create a quagmire that will sink Ukraine and further weaken the rest of Europe.

Less than two weeks after Donald Trump berated Volodymyr Zelenskyy, ejected him from the White House and cut off Ukraine’s support, he U-turned tothreatenfinancial measures “that would be very bad for Russia” if it did not reach a deal with Kyiv. Ukraine’sacceptance of a 30-day ceasefire proposal, building on its own suggestion of a halt in air and maritime conflict, threw the onus on Moscow. On Thursday, Vladimir Putin claimed to support the idea in theory – but warned of “serious issues” to address.Ukraine’s agreement prompted the resumption of US intelligence sharing and military aid, which may well have been Kyiv’s primary aim. Mr Trump would like to take the credit – and perhaps aspires to a Nobel prize – for a peace deal. Mr Trump, who was hosting Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, described the Russian president’s remarks as “very promising” albeit not “complete”. Even if he outsources the patience and focus required to reach an agreement, it is clear that he has no interest in the injustice or illegality of the invasion, that his sympathies lie with Mr Putin, and that he bears a deep grudge against Mr Zelenskyy.Fundamentally, Moscow can be more confident of its position than it was even a month ago. The west has been shown to be fundamentally divided and therefore weakened. On the battlefield, Russia also believes itself to have the upper hand, however painful its progress has been. It does not want togive Ukraine the chance to regroup. Speaking ahead of a meeting with the US envoy, Steve Witkoff, Mr Putin was too canny to dismiss Mr Trump’s plans outright. There will always be ways to defer a deal, or sabotage it later.The bigger issue is not its short-term hope of taking more territory, but its long-term, maximalist ambition to control Ukraine. Mr Putin remarked that a ceasefire should “remove the root causes of this crisis”: among other things, he wants its demilitarisation and assurances that it won’t join Nato. (“They discuss Nato, and being in Nato, and everybody knows what the answer to that is,” Mr Trump remarked.) Mr Putin certainly does not want troops from Nato countries there. But without them, Ukraine has no reason to believe that a halt on Russia’s part would be any more than a tactical measure. This is why, as Sir Keir Starmer said on Thursday, “It has to be a peace where the deal is defended.”Provisional halts in combat can lead to lasting peace; no treaty was signedto end the Korean war. And Mr Putincould yet see genuine advantages to a diplomatic route, especially if it involves early relaxation of sanctions. Russia is expert at interference operations and would surely see opportunities in a post-war Ukraine, with the option to return to warfare always available further down the track.The zigzags of recent days may materially affect the outcome of this conflict. The halting of aid and intelligence facilitated Russia taking back territory that Ukraine had seized in Kursk. Its resumption will allow Ukraine to fight better for longer. But the overall trajectory is still clear, and it leads away from US support for Ukraine and Europe. It is not unthinkable that Mr Trump might attemptto punish European nationsfor supplying arms to Kyiv in due course. Whether he is willing to exert real pressure on Mr Putin will shortly become clear. But neither Ukraine nor its friends can expect it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The move is designed to cut waste, “shift money to the front line” and put the English NHS underdemocratic control. It is a declaration of intent from a prime minister who wants Labour not to be the party of bigger government but the party of smarter government. At least, that’s the theory. The reality, as ever, is more complicated.This is less a grand health reform and more a strategic positioning exercise. The health secretary,Wes Streeting, the architect of this plan, is engaged in a delicate balancing act: convincing the Treasury that the NHS can stay within budget while simultaneously lobbying for more money that he knows the health service will inevitably require. The headline-grabbing cull of NHS England is useful – allowing Mr Streeting to claim that he is shifting cash from managers to patient care, a necessary concession when preparing to argue for more Treasury investment.The problem is that the numbers don’t add up. The savings from axing NHS England will be modest. The organisation’s cost to the Treasury is £2bn, a tiny fraction of the NHS’s £183bn budget for 2025/26. Of this, about£400mis spent on staff who work directly with local NHS bodies, and these roles will probably continue in some form. The savings come nowhere near enough to fill next year’s estimated£6.6bn funding gap. At best, it frees up a few hundred million pounds. At worst, it shifts costs elsewhere while causing months of upheaval in an already overstretched system.The NHS faces mounting pressure to cut costs, with a Labour chancellor insisting that it must live within its means. Hospital trusts will need to tighten their belts even further. It does not take a health economist to recognise that when resources are cut, patient demand does not magically disappear – it simply resurfaces elsewhere. If community services close to balance the books, then the pressure on GPs and A&E departments will only intensify. If the health service is told to domore with less, the risk is that it simply ends up doing less with less.Sir Keir’s embrace of Mr Streeting’s reform agenda is a calculated gamble. The prime minister is backing an NHS shake-up that may not deliver as promised. His support, however, bolsters Mr Streeting’s standing with the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who faces a looming fiscal shortfall. With tax rises off the table and her fiscal straitjacket firmly in place,spending cutsafter 2025/26 seem the only path left.The NHS may have won big in the last budget, but as the Darzi report warned, it remains in “serious trouble”. Years ofunder-investmentand overcrowded hospitals, with no relief from anoverstretchedsocial care system, have left it struggling. Without greater funding, it cannot meet the rising demand of an ageing population, let alone expand its workforce. Mr Streeting must keep pressing the Treasury, cloaking each plea for cash in the fashionable language of “modernising reform”.Such rhetorical agility is, if nothing else, a skill Westminster rewards. But whether he delivers on his three big shifts – moving care out of hospitals, prioritising prevention and digitising theNHS– remains to be seen. If the health service deteriorates further, the government will find that it has not only failed to fix the NHS but has taken ownership of its decline.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I have a mental health condition, physical disabilities and am neurodiverse. To do meaningful part-time work, I had to become self-employed, simply to work at my level of skill and experience. It costs me nearly £1,000 a month in various ways to remain well enough to work consistently – all post-tax.The NHS is merely keeping me alive – it isn’t interested in optimising my life, for example, by tackling the hideous side-effects of my medication – and the tax system refuses to recognise that anything more than keeping me alive is required. And aLabourgovernment thinks it can cast people out into the world of work with no resources to make them well enough to show up, day in, day out?Until the NHS can do a lot more than just keep us alive, and the tax system recognises how much it costs us to fill the remaining gap between existence and wellness to work, any cuts are going to have hideous consequences.I cannot bear the thought of a Labour government repeating thetragic losses of lifeseen when the personal independence payment system was sobadly introducedby the Tories. I have been broadly satisfied with what Labour has done with less money in the kitty, but this is deeply concerning.Heather BinghamWortwell, NorfolkYour article (12 March) mentions plans to cut universal credit for those judged unfit for work. If someone is genuinely unable to work because of sickness or disability, how can there beanyjustification for cutting their benefits? I should really like to understand the logic behind this. If someone is falsely claiming to be unable to work, this should be picked up by the assessment process.As someone who loved their job as a teacher until I was forced to stop working nine years ago as a result of a brain injury, I can assure the government that reducing my benefits will not help my brain heal.Carolyn SuttonGlastonbury, SomersetIn the 1970s, when I worked as an occupational psychologist (OP) for the then Ministry of Labour, there was a much more humane and effective way of getting the long-term sick back into work than the current punitive sanctions and cuts. At industrial rehabilitation units those recovering from injury or illness spent several weeks in work-like settings being assessed by a team including an OP, a doctor, social worker and disablement resettlement officer, before being placed in appropriate work or training. This worked well, a bit like a proper prison rehabilitation scheme that cuts recidivism rates.Enabling the disadvantaged to help themselves is much more effective, and cheaper in the long run, than simple “punishment”.Michael MillerSheffieldThe prime minister is right about Britain’s broken benefits system, but if the country does need to reboot the system, the government needs to respect rights while it does so. Adequate social security is not a political gift, it is a human right. Ensuring people can eat and live safely with their families and in communities is a right that the UK has committed to. However, successive governments have failed to respect and enforce those rights.And now, instead of using this moment to address the root causes of out-of-control costs of housing and essentials, and the resulting reliance on food banks and debt for so many people, it looks like this government is playing to the gallery and selling its reform credentials by making threats to reduce the “burden” on society of people who are ill or disabled. For so many in the UK, poverty is a political choice forced upon them. The prime minister can choose to end it.Sacha DeshmukhChief executive, Amnesty UKKeir Starmercannot reduce the colossal benefits bill without addressing the crisis in primary care in England. Medical certificates are signed by GPs. To help someone back into work or counsel them properly about their situation requires time and, ideally, a face-to-face appointment. I worked as a GP for the NHS for more than 20 years. Every day we had to prioritise seeing people who were acutely unwell over some of these other important needs. I, like many of my colleagues, have reissued a medical certificate to a patient I don’t know without so much as a phone call. And we spend many hours supporting patients with their appeal process when their benefits have been cut or stopped. Demand for appointments will soar as benefits are cut and poverty hits.Dr Natalie SymesLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Published in 2016, the Chilcot inquiry found serious failings in the British government, which ignored the warnings of millions of ordinary people over its disastrous decision to go to war.History is repeating itself. Today, the death toll in Gaza has reportedlyexceeded 61,000. Two Israeli officials are wanted by the international criminal court for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Britain has played a highly influential role in Israel’s military operations, including the sale of weapons, the supply of intelligence and the use of Royal Air Force bases in Cyprus.Transparency and accountability are cornerstones of democracy. Therefore we are demanding an independent, public inquiry into the UK’s involvement in Israel’s military assault in Gaza. This inquiry should establish exactly what decisions have been taken, how they have been made and what consequences they have had. Any meaningful inquiry would require the full cooperation of ministers involved in decision-making processes since October 2023.Many people believe that the government has taken decisions that have implicated officials in the gravest breaches of international law. These charges will not go away until there is an inquiry with the legal power to establish the truth.Jeremy CorbynIndependent Alliance,Brendan O’HaraMiddle East spokesperson, Scottish National party,Carla DenyerCo-leader, Green party,Brian LeishmanScottish Labour,Diane AbbottLabour,Zarah SultanaIndependent,Richard BurgonLabourExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warJeremy CorbynCarla DenyerDiane AbbottLabourScottish National party (SNP)Green partylettersShareReuse this content"

United came atReal Sociedadrelentlessly, a whir of energy and creativity that is the best advertisement yet for where their head coach might take them.Manchester United v Real Sociedad: Europa League last-16, second leg – liveRead moreBruno Fernandes crowned his and United’s night with a blistering hat-trick strike, running on to Alejandro Garnacho’s pass to blaze into the left corner to send United’s faithful ballistic and secure a quarter-final against Lyon.As the captain said: “This club is all about winning. We have a long way to go, but we are confident that if we focus and have the right mentality we can win games.”By the close, United had two legs versus Lyon – on 10 and 17 April – to navigate and make the semi-finals: they should fancy their chances to go all the way.A Stretford End tifo-scale banner featuring United’s pitchfork-­wielding red devil and an explosion of fireworks heralded kick-off but what followed was the visitors pummelling their hosts in an opening that closed with Imanol Alguacil’s men 1-0 ahead.This was via their leader, Mikel Oyarzabal, claiming and converting a penalty. It was too simple for La Real as Fernandes failed to stop Aritz Elustondo’s low cross from the right, Ayden Heaven’s leg did the same at the near post, and down went Oyarzabal under ­Matthijs de Ligt’s clumsy challenge. The VAR sent Benoît Bastien to the monitor, the spot-kick was awarded. Oyarzabal beat André Onana with ease.United struck back and would dominate the rest of the tie. Fernandes initiated the scoring move, aiming a ball for Rasmus Højlund, the striker was impeded from addressing due to Igor Zubeldia’s shove. ­Bastien awarded a second penalty and a Fernandes hop-and-skip prefaced a coolly-taken equaliser that went to Alex Remiro’s right, the keeper diving the other way.View image in fullscreenReal Sociedad’s Jon Aramburu (no 19) and his teammates are left dumbfounded after his red card.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersSuddenly, United were the ­buccaneering force via a ­muscular pace that exhilarated and pleased their head coach. Percussive passes were exchanged, players were pictures of motion and fluidity.One sequence featured Fernandes ­tapping to Joshua Zirkzee, who passed to a Patrick Dorgu stampeding down the left. The wingback dinked over the ball, it reached Garnacho, and his shot was stymied.As piercing, a little after, was the balletic Zirkzee footwork that allowed him to find Højlund whose flick narrowly missed.The latter was joined in the starting XI by Onana and Casemiro, a trio who, according to Sir Jim Ratcliffe, form a not-so fabulous three, the owner referencing them this week as part of a band of squad members who are “overpaid and not good enough”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another from the latter ensued when Dorgu broke through the inside-left channel: the Dane, overlapping, screamed to be fed but Dorgu decided to fire and the ball dribbled tamely into Remiro’s hands. Dorgu, earlier, hit a volley straight from a corner: it missed, too, rippling the roof of the net, but here was more of the inventive play that has been missing for an age from this team.With the contest at 2-2 overall, the second half could be billed as 45 minutes to save United’s bid for silverware. They had the very best start. A raid ended with Zirkzee letting fly, Remiro palming the ball into Dorgu’s path and Elustondo, illegally, ­stopping the Dane’s run. A third penalty was given and Fernandes netted his second, this time aiming to Remiro’s left, the ­keeper guessing – again – the wrong side.Cue rapture from the congregation who were witnessing the most complete performance under Amorim. Dorgu, too, was showing why the Portuguese signed him in the winter window, a next offering a scything burst down the left and pass over that would have been a toe-in for Højlund but for Remiro’s intervention.United were bright and aggressive as Garnacho proved by sprinting to intercept a ball near goal, Remiro, whose loose pass it was, saving his blushes by clutching the cross. In a central zone, he fed Zirkzee who relayed to the excellent Højlund and he ­rampaged in, an effort missing marginally to his right.Zirkzee and Dorgu were among United’s standouts and the two combined to have Jon Aramburu sent off. The first’s curving pass had the second cutting across the substitute who bundled him down and, as the last man, the busy Bastien had to issue the red card.Real Sociedad were stunned. Now came Fernandes’s box-office finish plus a late Diogo Dalot bonus, Dorgu decorating his outing by insisting he should not be awarded a penalty when colliding with Hamari Traoré.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueManchester UnitedReal Sociedadmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It finally ended with Barry Ferguson’s players bouncing up and down in front of the Copland Road stand while José Mourinho, who had worn a face as ashen as his all-grey outfit asFenerbahcefluffed their lines from the spot, led his to perform mea culpas 100 metres away. The night had swung in multiple directions but, over their week’s work, Rangers deserved their shot at toppling Athletic Bilbao in the last eight.Mourinho could only watch as Fenerbahce, having levelled the tie up and brought on the cavalry, failed to putRangersaway in the final 50 minutes. He would surely have expected more from Dusan Tadic and Fred, both of whom saw Jack Butland make tremendous saves, in the shoot-out; when Mert Hakan Yandas spooned the final penalty over it was party time for the home support, a miss from Ianis Hagi amongst it all rendered entirely irrelevant.Tottenham and Rangers reach Europa League quarter-finals – as it happenedRead moreRangers, full of willing and energy but lacking the quality that would eliminate drama, can take credit for maintaining a threat even while wobbling terribly. They had Fenerbahce, who had not seemed capable of matching their intensity for most of the first half, where they wanted them until Sebastian Szymanski scored a superb opener before the teams went in. Fenerbahce are patently a team of moments and found another when Szymanski squeezed in their leveller but Rangers were never quite hanging on for dear life.They did, however, frequently live with hearts in their mouths. That was never more so than the moment when Yandas went down in the box under Nico Raskin’s challenge three minutes from the end of extra time. Fenerbahce screamed blue murder; an apoplectic Mourinho, who had pounded the technical area threadbare all evening, frantically mimed a VAR screen but his only reward was a yellow card and the penalty would soon get worse.The episode naturally provided ample post-match ammunition. Fenerbahce had seen other spot kick appeals turned down, including a Filip Kostic shout for handball against Ridvan Yilmaz. “If you don’t get three [penalties], you get two,” Mourinho said. “If you don’t get two, you get one. If you don’t get one, it’s strange.” The subsequent rabbit hole of conspiracy included the latest dangling of his Roma side’sEuropa Leaguefinal defeat to Sevilla in 2023, which brought him a four-game ban, as a possible reason for Fenerbahce’s perceived ill treatment.Regardless, Mourinho was laying it on thickly when he claimed Fenerbahce were the only deserving cause on show. They had started the match slowly, strutting around in comparison to a Rangers side in which Vaclav Cerny was again an indefatigable, bustling force. Cerny, who let pot shots fly all night and worked the keeper Irfan Egribayat more than once, would later convert impressively from the spot. But Szymanski’s hooked volley was a lifeline and Fenerbahce found it in themselves to probe extensively after the interval.View image in fullscreenFenerbahce’s Sebastian Szymanski scores their spectacular first goal.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersEventually they equalised when Szymanski converted Mert Müldür’s low centre. Ibrox was a skittish, worried place by that point. Mourinho deployed the cavalry in the forms of Tadic and Edin Dzeko; Rangers were alarmingly loose but survived the rocky road to extra time and it is to Ferguson’s huge credit that they gathered breath for a fresh push thereafter.“They’re digging deep for me and that’s all I ask of them,” he said of his team afterwards. That was in no doubt, James Tavernier snuffing out a clear chance at one end and forcing a flying stop from Egribayat with a free-kick at the other. Rangers rode their luck in the additional 30 minutes but Fenerbahce lacked the composure to condemn them and the hosts had enough presence of their own to keep play pinging from end to end.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For all the agonies that led them here, Rangers evidently enjoyed winning in this fashion too.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueRangersFenerbahcematch reportsShareReuse this content"

In his statement on Thursday, however, he conceded that it had not been possible to work out a solution.“For the last six months, my advisors have been working with HMRC in an attempt to find a solution to my financial situation,” Dettori said in a statement. “Regretfully, I will be filing for bankruptcy.“I am saddened and embarrassed by this outcome and would advise others to take a stronger rein over their financial matters.“Bankruptcy is a major decision and its consequences will affect me for many years.”Dettori, who rode hundreds of major winners in Britain and abroad during a glittering 35-year career in the saddle, has been living and riding in California since the end of 2023. He left the European stage with a flourish, winning the Champion Stakes at Ascot, Britain’s most valuable race, aboard King Of Steel.He was also one of very few riders to enjoy a high profile with the general public, not least as a result of his extraordinary achievement in riding all seven winners on a single card at Ascot in 1996.He also appeared as a team captain for several seasons of the BBC’s Question Of Sport, while business ventures outside racing included Frankie’s Bar & Grill, a chain of restaurants in the UK and Dubai, launched in association with the chef, Marco Pierre White.Explore more on these topicsFrankie DettoriHorse racingnewsShareReuse this content"

With three fly-halves in the squad, there is no obvious centre cover and Tommy Freeman is starting there for England for the first time.Earl played the last six minutes ofEngland’s 47-24 victory over Italyon Sunday at centre and scored the final try. Borthwick first used him in the backline during the emphatic victory over Japan last summer.Borthwick deserves credit after bold selection for England’s Wales testRead moreBorthwick’s predecessor, Eddie Jones, highlighted Earl’s suitability to playing in the backs and would regularly talk of the future emergence of “hybrid” players, usingJack Nowell’s ability to play at flankeras an example. His theory seems to be coming true withFrance deploying a 7-1 splitintheir victory over Irelandon Saturday with Oscar Jégou, a back-rower by trade, excelling for 33 minutes at centre. South Africa, who were the first to name seven forwards on their bench, often deploy Kwagga Smith as a hybrid replacement.When naming his team, Borthwick said shifting Fin Smith to inside-centre is also an option, raising the tantalising prospect ofhim, Marcus Smith and George Ford being on the pitchat the same time. But if Fraser Dingwall or Freeman go down early with injury – asOllie Lawrence did last week– Earl is set to join the backs.“That’s the magic of the 6-2 I believe. That’s what it gives you,” Borthwick said. “We saw Jégou come on last week. I thought he was tremendous.“The crossover is crazy between 12 or centre and a back-rower. It’s the same position, you just wear a different number and you defend in a slightly different position off a scrum. That’s the only slight technical difference.”Earl also revealed he tends to chip in with some backs drills to prepare for the potential switch to midfield. “I do some bits but I don’t do it all because I have a job to do as [a member of the] pack but as and when I will do a bit of training there,” he said. “It is not something you overthink. It is just rugby at the end of the day, half the stuff I do is as a 12 anyway. It is all pretty complementary. It is not too dissimilar.”Earl has started at openside flanker for England’s past three matches but returns to No 8 on Saturday with the Curry twins in harness from the start. The back-row battle is likely to be key in Cardiff and Earl believes England’s pace gives them a point of difference.“The thing you are seeing around the park is speed wins,” he said. “France is the classic case, [Louis] Bielle-Biarrey is the quickest person I have seen play the game and every time he gets the ball he can make something happen. Speed seems to be more of a priority to some teams than others but for us, we are talking a lot about moving the ball, being aggressive, outworking teams.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the breakdown. I would caveat that by saying what team doesn’t have good jackallers, what team doesn’t have that threat?”Assuming Ireland secure a bonus point win in Italy, England need to follow suit in Cardiff to move top of the table before France host Scotland. “How does our mindset change? It doesn’t,” said Earl. “Look after our own house first, win, play well, if we can win well even better.“If that gives us a shot on Saturday then so be it, but we can’t control anything that happens other than underneath that roof. It’s quite liberating in that sense.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamSix NationsSix Nations 2025Rugby unionSteve BorthwicknewsShareReuse this content"

Unai Emery is a former PSG manager, Marco Asensio is on loan from the Ligue 1 club, but McGinn’s ties are more modest, if not tenuous.“The only place I’ve been there is the shop,” he says, smiling. “We were in a big campervan and stopped off in Paris. I think I was about seven or eight … I remember getting a PSG strip.”Aston Villa earn shot at greatness after setting up historic PSG showdown | Jonathan WilsonRead moreNext stop, Paris, in the Champions League quarter-finals. It has been quite the adventure: memorable trips toYoung Boys,Leipzig,Monaco, two to Brugge, and McGinn says the ride can continue.PSG defeated Liverpoolover two absorbing legs in the last 16, prevailing on penalties, and the Villa captain, while acknowledging their prowess, is predicting another close tie.“It’s going to be a tighter game than a lot of people realise and we’ll certainly give everything we have to get through,” he says. “We’ve shown over the years, especially at Villa Park that we can compete against the best in the world, whether that’s Man City or Liverpool in full flow. PSG have got a lot in their armoury which can hurt us, but we have a lot in ours that can hurt them.”October’s victory over Bayern Munich, another European superpower, will be hard to eclipse but the claret-and-blue convoys who will cross the Channel have grown used to supposed ceilings being shattered of late. “Whether they get on the ferry, get in their cars, there will be plenty of Aston Villa fans over there,” McGinn says.“We all deserve it. Why not dare to dream? We can carry this journey on. You never, never know – stranger things have happened. We know we’re capable of playing against the best, competing against the best and I’m sure every team that comes up against us will know they’re in for a game.”View image in fullscreenMarco Asensio has scored seven goals in his past five matches, including two against Club Brugge, and is free to face his parent club, PSG in the Champions League.Photograph: Manjit Narotra/ProSports/ShutterstockThere is no shortage of belief. Not under Emery, a coach besotted with European competition; not with the superstar loanees Asensio and Marcus Rashford making a splash. Asensio has scored seven goals in his past five matches, including another doublein victory against Bruggeafter entering at half-time on Wednesday. On another night he would have left with not just the player-of-the-match award but the match ball. Most importantly for Villa, Uefa rules permit Asensio to face his parent club. The ominous bit is Asensio is not yet at full fitness.“That’s the exciting thing for us,” McGinn says. “It’ll be a strange one for him, but maybe he’s got a bit to prove to them. He probably feels he deserved more game time [at PSG]. We love having him here. His quality is just clear to see.

But it said findings that “raised additional suspicions of manipulation” led to the suspensions of Pederson, Sundal and Johansson, who will not be able to take part in any events organized by FIS or national ski associations.“The rules are quite clear. The rules are made by all the ski family,” FIS secretary general Michel Vion told a news conference in Oslo where a World Cup event started on Thursday. “We know exactly the situation and I heard [it said] that, ‘Yeah, but ski jumping is special. They [are always] on the limit, we can play’ ... No, there’s no play. There’s no game here. It’s only rules.”It is not known how widespread the practice of manipulating pre-approved suits is within ski jumping.Lindvik and Forfang said they knew nothing about deliberately altered equipment, but their coach Magnus Brevig and equipment manager Adrian Livelten confessedand were stood down from their jobs.The investigation will be made by the FIS independent ethics and compliance office.“We are all aware that this is not the best moment for ski jumping, but I think this is the way that we want to go,” FIS race director of ski jumping Sandro Pertile said. “In this case we have, we are into an intentional manipulation.

She is deeply concerned by the growing number of incidents of so-called fans abusing players.“We’re always saying we’re proud in the women’s game that we’re very inclusive but somehow that is starting to slip away a bit,” Miedema says. “If we don’t act really strongly right now then it might be too late.Will Gareth Taylor’s Manchester City sacking turn out to be a masterstroke?Read more“As a player and advocate for women’s football, I’ve always been one of the ones shouting that we need to wave our own path in women’s football and we need to be really careful in how we want to grow and develop. Because the easiest thing is to change completely into men’s football. But if we are so proud of the environment we’ve created, we need to be really, really careful in the next steps we’re making.”Miedema issues that warning in a candid interview at City’s training ground, 48 hours after Liverpool’sTaylor Hinds was subjected to a “inappropriate comment”from a spectator at Arsenal on Sunday, and just over a month after her teammate Khadija “Bunny” Shaw was subjected toracist and misogynistic abuse, which remains under investigation by Greater Manchester police.Miedema knows that the majority of women’s crowds are “still a lot of lovely, loving football fans” but says: “The situation in the football world is certainly not where we want it to be. I think Bunny prioritising her mental health [anddeciding to miss a match] after what happened is probably the strongest thing anyone could have done in that situation, which me personally and the team respect her for massively. What we can do is be there for Bunny and keep voicing that things do need to be better.”On the pitch, Miedema, the Women’s Super League’s record goalscorer, enjoys linking up with Shaw, last season’s Golden Boot winner who is leading the WSL’s scoring charts again this term with 12 goals in 14 appearances. Miedema says they have “funny competitions” in training, battling to see “who’s the better finisher”, but knows they can combine effectively.“We’ve got complete opposite strengths, which is probably the reason why we actually can work together really well. At times it’s been difficult because I’ve had my injury, Bunny’s had her injury, so only in the last couple of games you can now see it starting to click. I’m really, really excited to see wherever that can lead us. If you look at the quality we have on the pitch, especially going forward, it’s unreal. The moment that starts clicking then I’m pretty convinced we can still beat anyone.”View image in fullscreenKhadija ‘Bunny’ Shaw with Miedema. ‘We’ve got complete opposite strengths,’ Miedema says.Photograph: James Gill/Danehouse/Getty ImagesMiedema says she had “needed something new” when she joined City last summer after seven years at Arsenal. Knee surgery in October, weeks afterCity’s 2-0 victoryover the defending European champions Barcelona, sidelined her until mid-January, when she embarked on a run of five goals in four games. City have also had to contend with the absence of Lauren Hemp, Alex Greenwood, Shaw and others.“Welcome to women’s football,” Miedema says with a wry smile. “It’s obviously one of the reasons that all of us players keep asking for a better schedule and more breaks. Respect to the whole club and the team on how we’ve dealt with it. We’ve been trying to stay really positive but yes, sometimes it is a wee bit like: ‘Oh, what if everyone was fit?’ because we all still remember that game we played against Barcelona with a fully fit team. Where would we have been? But it’s part of football.”Another thing that Miedema knows is part of the game is managerial changes, after Monday’s surprisesacking of Gareth Taylor. City’s former manager Nick Cushing has taken interim charge for the remainder of the season. Miedema speaks respectfully about Taylor as she says: “We know that big decisions have to be made at times. It’s still difficult, as a group. My personal relationship with Gareth was really positive. I’ve really enjoyed playing under him. I’m really grateful that he’s actually made me enjoy playing football again.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Miedema scoredthe winner in the finalagainst Cushing’s City in 2018 – “I might actually mention that to him tomorrow morning,” she jokes when reminded – to secure the first trophy of Joe Montemurro’s tenure as Arsenal manager, before adding the WSL title the following season. She recalls that 2018 final as one “that shaped a lot of the Joe era at Arsenal” and hopes history can repeat itself.View image in fullscreenVivianne Miedema takes a shot during January’s WSL game against Manchester United.Photograph: Ed Sykes/Action Images/ReutersThe 28-year-old says of Cushing: “A lot of girls are really, really positive about him. This morning he handled the whole situation really well. He got energy into the group straight away. First of all I think [he was] really respectful of where Gareth has brought us in the season. We’re still in three [cup] competitions, still fighting for that Champions League ticket in the league as well [City are fourth in the table].”Saturday’s game at Derby’s Pride Park is the first of four consecutive meetings with Chelsea, their Champions League quarter-final sandwiching next weekend’s league game. “We know each other so well,” Miedema says. “Maybe at one point we’ll actually get fed up seeing each other and playing against each other. We know their qualities, we know how good they can be.

Ordinary enough, except that it is elevated high in the air. Why? Because this is where it will need to be in 2100, given rising sea levels in the Netherlands, where it was made by the artist Boris Maas.Entitled The Urge to Sit Dry (2018), there is another like it in the office of the Dutch environment minister in The Hague, a constant reminder of the real andimmediate threat posed to the countryby rising sea levels.View image in fullscreenThe Dutch artist Boris Maas with his 2018 work The Urge to Sit Dry, which uses wooden blocks to lift the chair to the height it needs to be to sit above predicted sea levelsThe chair is part of Can the Seas Survive Us?, which opens this weekend in the Sainsbury Centre, a Norwich art gallery and museum. The location is significant: Norfolk is one of the areas of the UKmost vulnerable to rising sea levels. Visitors will take a metaphorical dive into the murky complexities of an ecosystem we all know is at risk, but often find hard to decipher, still less to work out what we can do to change things.“As with so many of the big, thorny questions around climate and the future of the planet, people don’t know where to start,” says Jago Cooper, director of the Sainsbury Centre.“ We can project people’s imaginations and realities to places and spaces they would never otherwise have access to – they can be transported to melting Arctic ice floes, to the Pacific hundreds of years ago, to underneath the sea today.”The exhibition consists of three separate shows. The first isA World of Water, held in a series of underground galleries painted, Rothko-like, in a shade of baby blue on top (to symbolise the sea we swim in) and a deep, marine green below (symbolising the vast, hidden sea).View image in fullscreenEvan Ifekoya’s video Contoured Thoughts (2019). The sea is an ‘embodied presence’ in the artist’s work. Courtesy of Lux, LondonOne of objects is a tall, grey-green sculpture, with a Barbara Hepworth-like aperture at its centre. But this is nothing to do with Hepworth: it’s by a Rotterdam artist, Jan Eric Visser, a sculptor whose raw material is rubbish – in this case, plastics collected from waterways.Many of the artists in this show – put together by John Kenneth Paranada, the Sainsbury Centre’s curator of art and climate change – are Dutch, underlining the impact the climate crisis has had and will continue to have on the work of those artists who feel the threat most keenly.In one wonderful textile piece, Radical Furniture for Radical Times (2019) by Koen Taselaar, octopuses – a species known for their intelligence and adaptability – seem to have taken over and now live in an underwater house with brightly painted staircases, dressing tables and lamps, and a sofa on which a couple of them are comfortably sprawling.View image in fullscreenMaggi Hambling’s Wall of Water VIII (2011). ‘Water is a metaphor for life,’ she says. ‘The sea can represent your happiest moments and your darkest moments’And British artists are also responding to the climate emergency: both Maggi Hambling and Claire Cansick, whose work is in the show, have been clear about their concern over climate change and its impact on their painting.Hambling’s Wall of Water VIII (2011) is one of the show’s standout pieces – a tide of greys, blues, pinks and blacks that is at once mesmerisingly beautiful and ominous. Cansick’s canvases, painted from snapshots taken while she was swimming, merge the world of sea, land and air – she depicts waves but they might be grass or clouds.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenYuki Kihara, Two Fa’afafine (after Gauguin), and Darwin Drag.

It was signed by 195 environmental groups such as the Sierra Club, Earthjustice and Sunrise Movement; legal non-profits including the American Association for Justice and Public Justice; and dozens of other organizations.Over the last decade, states and municipalities have brought more than 30 lawsuits accusing big oil of intentionally covering up the climate risks of their products, and seeking potentially billions in damages. The defendants have worked to kill the cases, with limited success.View image in fullscreenAn ad on a truck at the CERAWeek oil and gas conference in Houston.Photograph: Dharna NoorNow, with Republicans in control of the White House and both congressional chambers, advocates fear the industry will go further, pursuing total immunity from all existing and future climate lawsuits. To do so, they could lobby for a liability waiver like the onegranted to the firearms industryin 2005, which hassuccessfully blocked most attempts to hold them accountable for violence.“Lawmakers must decisively reject any attempt by the fossil fuel industry to evade accountability and ensure both justice today and the right of future generations to hold polluters responsible for decades of deception,” said the missive, which is addressed to the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, and Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer.Fossil fuel companies have vied for such a get-out-of-jail-free card for years. In 2017, a coalition of Republican officials, economists and oil companiesproposedlegal liability as a condition of a carbon tax, arguing the industry could not weather both. When the council abandoned the waiver proposal two years later, Exxon threatened toleavethe group,documents subpoenaed by the Senateshow.Then, in 2020, a waiver was quietly included in a draft of a Covid-19 spending package but was later removed, theinvestigative climate outlet Drilled found.Such a waiver could only pass through the Senate with supermajority support, requiring backing from some Democrats. In a January interview, Michael Gerrard, a climate law expert at Columbia University, said it is “hard to imagine” it winning bipartisan backing. But the advocates fear oil companies could lobby officials to once again quietly tuck the proposal into a larger, must-pass piece of legislation.“Democrats need to be on guard,” said Aaron Regunberg, the climate accountability project director at the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, which signed the letter.The authors of the letter do not have hard evidence of a current industry push for legal immunity, but their concerns come amid wider attacks on climate litigation.On the campaign trail, Trumppledgedto “stop the wave of frivolous litigation from environmental extremists”. And this month, a rightwing thinktank launched acampaignattempting to shoot down litigation from “radical climate groups”, which it called the “biggest risk” toDonald Trump’s energy agenda, E&E News reported. The thinktankhas tiesto Leonard Leo, who is widely known as a force behind the Federalist Society, which orchestrated the ultraconservative takeover of the American judiciary.Last year, Leo-tied groups alsolaunched another campaign, which one expert called “unprecedented”, to convince the supreme court to shield oil companies from lawsuits. In decisionsthis weekand inJanuary, the high court denied their request.A truck parked outside a major fossil fuel conference on Monday in Houston, warned that “lawfare and anti-energy laws are threatening America’s pro-consumer energy dominance”, linking to anop-ed from a group with links to Leo.Climate superfund lawsAnother development sparking worry at oil companies: “climate superfund” bills, meant to make big polluters help pay for climate action.Last year, Vermont and New York passed such measures, which are loosely modeled on the US superfund program. Ten other states are considering similar proposals, which could each cost the industry billions or trillions.Red states and oil lobby groups are legally challenging the laws. This week, the Federalist Society – which Leo co-chairs – hosted apanelcriticizing the measures.“If they are seeking a liability waiver, they might also seek congressional action precluding the state climate superfund laws,” Gerrard said.It is a major fear for Cassidy DiPaola of the pro-climate superfund group Make Polluters Pay, which signed the letter.“What’s at stake here isn’t just who pays for climate disasters,” she said. “It’s whether our democracy allows powerful industries to simply rewrite the rules when justice catches up to them.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsDemocracy and justiceFossil fuelsOil and gas companiesClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

That opening event, expected in June, was touched on during the meeting, but a presidential visit was not discussed.The meeting, which is Swinney’s first with any member of the Trump family, took place amid rising tensions between the UK and the White House over the Trump administration’s stance on Ukraine and the punitive tariffs it has introduced, including on British steel and aluminium.The visit suggests Trump is keen to restore friendly links with Scotland, where he owns the Turnberry golfing resort in Ayrshire and a boutique hotel and golf course north of Aberdeen.Eric Trump, the organisation’s executive vice-president, said: “I’m delighted to say that it was a very warm and friendly meeting and this is the first time that a first minister has invited us to Bute House.“The first minister thanked me for the Trump Organization’s ongoing colossal investment and commitment to Scotland. This is the first time that I’ve heard those words from the first minister and they were hugely appreciated.”Swinney’s spokesperson insisted there was nothing unusual about the event. “This is not a political meeting, it’s a business meeting,” he said. “We are trying to act as a responsible government would and treat business figures in the same way.”Lorna Slater, the Scottish Greens’ co-leader, said the meeting was “a bad call that sends a terrible message”.“When it comes to the Trumps, the line between business and politics has always been blurred.“Eric Trump is not a normal businessman. He is a rightwing extremist that has peddled misinformation and conspiracy theories. He is a figurehead for an administration that is wrecking our planet while cosying up to Vladimir Putin and showing total contempt for human rights and democracy.”Until now, Donald Trump has had a chilly relationship with the Scottish government. He publicly fell out with the former first minister Alex Salmond over the latter’s backing for offshore windfarms near Trump’s Aberdeenshire course.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Stephen Flynn, the SNP’s Westminster leader, said on X that the prime minister “better get back up off his knees and revoke that offer of a state visit”.Swinney has rejected those challenges, and told MSPs at Holyrood last week that the state visit should only be reconsidered if Trump continued to threaten and undermine the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Otherwise, he said, Starmer’s offer of a second state visit was prudent given the seriousness of the crisis in Ukraine.Eric Trump is also expected to visit Turnberry, where pro-Palestinian activists heavily damaged parts of his golf course and sprayed pro-Gaza protest slogans on the grass on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsScotlandEric TrumpDonald TrumpJohn SwinneynewsShareReuse this content"

And it’s not a Labour thing to do … It’s not what they’re for.”Labour MPs have already expressed private concerns that some of the proposed changes go further than Osborne’s cuts under austerity. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Keir Starmer insisted again that his plans did not mean a “return to austerity”.Osborne, who oversaw billions in welfare cuts during his time as chancellor, said he faced strong opposition to freezing Pip. “I didn’t freeze Pip. I thought [it] would not be regarded as very fair. What I did try to do was reform Pip,” he told the podcast.He said his final budget attempt to reform the generosity of Pip payments, including to those who could do some work, was the final straw that led to the resignation of the then work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith.“I had to back down on it. And so it’s all very well saying ‘don’t go for the general freeze, it’s not fair’. However, in politics and often for the Treasury, general freezes have been easier to sell than specific reforms that actually cut in cash terms the payments that certain sections of the disability-claiming community received,” he said.The Guardian understands that under current plans, the bulk of almost £6bn of cuts will come from the Pip, which is not linked to work, and eligibility criteria for the key disability benefit will be tightened, while some payments are expected to be frozen.Speaking on a visit to Hull on Thursday, Starmer said the current system “can’t be defended on economic terms or moral terms”. He said: “We’ve set up a system that basically says: ‘If you try the journey from where you are into work and anything goes wrong, you’ll probably end up in a worse position than when you started.’skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’re also the party of equality and fairness, but we’re not returning to austerity. That’s what I said before the election. That’s what I say now.”Figures from the Department for Work and Pensions on Thursday found the number of people on the highest rate of universal credit with no support to look for work had almost quadrupled since the pandemic. For younger people under 25, that figure had risen 249%, from 46,000 to 160,000, since the pandemic.The department said that while a rise in those categorised as “limited capability for work related activity” was expected as part of the transition to universal credit, it had “surged far beyond projections”.Explore more on these topicsBenefitsDisabilityPublic financeEd BallsGeorge OsborneWelfarenewsShareReuse this content"

This does not substitute comprehensive advice he routinely receives from officials.“The government is using AI as a labour-saving tool – supported by clear guidance on how to quickly and safely make use of the technology.”Keir Starmergave a speechon Thursday promising widespread changes to the civil service, including greater use of AI.“If we push forward with digital reform of government – and we are going to do that – we can make massive savings, £45bn savings in efficiency,” the prime minister said. “AI is a golden opportunity.”Kyle has championed initiatives within government, which include spearheadingcontroversial plansto exempt AI companies from copyright rules so they can access creative content for free.Some criticshave accused himof being too close to the industry, pointing out that while Kyle was in opposition, a staff member from the AI company Faculty AI was seconded to his office.In January, the technology secretarytold PoliticsHomehe would often use ChatGPT “to try and understand the broader context where an innovation came from, the people who developed it, the organisations behind them”.He added: “ChatGPT is fantastically good, and where there are things that you really struggle to understand in depth,ChatGPTcan be a very good tutor for it.”He previouslytold the Times: “AI can tutor you. So for example, I can go into a chatbot and say ‘What is quantum mechanics and what are its applications?’, and it can come up with a description, it will tutor you.”When New Scientist asked for his ChatGPT prompts and answers the department initially refused, saying the information would include conversations made in a personal and official capacity. When the magazine explained it wanted to see those made in an official capacity, the department supplied the information.According to the exchanges, Kyle asked why small- and medium-sized businesses had been so slow to take up AI.The chatbot replied: “While the UK government has launched initiatives to encourage AI adoption, many SMBs are unaware of these programs or find them difficult to navigate. Limited access to funding or incentives to de-risk AI investment can also deter adoption.”On another occasion, Kyle asked: “I’m secretary of state for science, innovation and technology in the United Kingdom. What would be the best podcasts for me to appear on to reach a wide audience that’s appropriate for my ministerial responsibilities?”ChatGPT suggestedThe Infinite Monkey CageandThe Naked Scientists.Some have said using ChatGPT in this way poses policy risks.Beeban Kidron, the film director and member of the House of Lords who is leading the opposition to the government’s AI copyright plans, said: “I am a bit worried that the science and innovation department is bedazzled with technical developments and not doing enough to protect UK democratic and economic interests.”Explore more on these topicsPeter KyleChatGPTArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingLabourChatbotsnewsShareReuse this content"

In some cases, bed shortages meant patients were placed in seclusion rooms, sparse rooms with limited furnishings not designed for long-term use.In another service, 16 patients were allocated to a 12-bed ward, meaning that four – who were either being treated voluntarily or were on overnight leave – did not have a bed to return to.Marjorie Wallace, the chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, said sectioned people were “still being shunted around the country like unwanted parcels”.“Callers to our helpline, SANEline, report they are told there are no beds available locally and crisis and intervention teams are full to capacity,” she said.Hughes said: “Fundamental problems with the very basics of safe care, like adequate staffing levels, bed capacity and run-down hospitals, are severely impacting people’s ability to properly recover.“Isolating people and holding them in crumbling, outdated facilities is the very opposite of dignified, humane care. In some cases, people with mental health problems can’t even get outside to a monitored courtyard for fresh air due to such low staffing levels.”Brian Dow, the deputy chief executive of the charity Rethink Mental Illness, said the report provided “yet more evidence that our mental health system is at breaking point”.“Given today’s news that theNHS will now come under direct political control, we’re calling for a clear plan on how it will ensure mental health services have the funding and staff to deliver timely support,” he said.In the UK, the charityMindis available on 0300 123 3393 andChildlineon 0800 1111.

But in January a jury found Sentamu, of New Addington, near Croydon, guilty of murder by a majority verdict.On Thursday the judge, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb, sentenced Sentamu to life in prison with a minimum term of 23 years as he had taken a knife to the scene.View image in fullscreenElianne Andam.Photograph: Metropolitan police/PAAddressing Sentamu, she said: “Elianne was 15 when you murdered her. She will always remain just 15, she will never realise the potential of her life. The pain of her loss to her parents and younger brother is indescribable.”Cheema-Grubb noted that a mural had been painted for Elianne near where she was killed. She said: “Its presence marks the determination of the community as forcefully as they can – put the knives down.”Sentamu had a history of attacking girls and had been cautioned about taking a knife to school, the trial heard.He had been the boyfriend of Elianne’s friend, who cannot be named for legal reasons. After the relationship ended, Elianne accompanied her friend to meet Sentamu to swap personal possessions, including a teddy bear. When he failed to hand over the possessions that he held in a bag, a row broke out that ended in Sentamu fatally attacking Elianne as she tried to run away.Sentamu’s ex-girlfriend told the court that during the row Elianne had grabbed the bag as a joke. Sentamu then chased her and stabbed her on the ground despite her pleas for him to stop, the court was told.As he awaited trial, Sentamu had threatened to “do it again”, the court heard.At this sentencing hearing it was also revealed that he attacked a child at Oakhill secure training centre while on remand.The prosecutor Ben Lloyd said Sentamu punched the victim in the face, knocking him to the floor.In mitigation, the defence barrister Pavlos Panayi KC said: “A crime as horrific as this leaves no real room for advocacy. There are no words that can possibly minimise, justify or excuse anything Hassan Sentamu did.”Referring to Sentamu’s background, he said: “Hassan’s violent streak, his anger, his outbursts, did not come out of nowhere. He was not born with them. They come from his lived experiences from when he was a little boy.”Panayi added: “He has enough good in himself to recognise and hate himself for it.” He cited suicide notes at the time of the murder.Earlier at the hearing, Elianne’s parents, Dorcas and Michael Andam, urged the judge to impose the “strongest possible sentence”.In a victim impact statement read to the court by Lloyd, Elianne’s mother said Sentamu was motivated by “greed and selfishness” and showed disregard for her daughter’s life.Addressing Sentamu, she added: “Your actions were senseless, monstrous and evil. You left the scene without any remorse. Instead you tried to make excuses and cover your act with evil lies.“You did not only kill Elianne, you killed me mentally and emotionally. We are left with nothing but pictures, videos. Your actions were senseless and evil.”A statement from her father, which was also read to court, said his daughter taught him “how to love” and “how to be a dad”.His statement added: “No parent should ever have to bury their child, let alone [one who has died] in such a violent manner.”He added: “I could not protect her; that guilt will weigh on my heart for the rest of my life.”Explore more on these topicsViolence against women and girlsKnife crimeLondonEnglandCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

The trade body has blamed post-Brexit trading arrangements for the slump in UK exports.The total volume of food and drink imports to the UK rose to their highest ever level last year, at a time when British farmers arewarning that a “cashflow crisis”and series of pressures including planned tax changes, bad weather and rising costs are squeezing domestic food production.Imports of food and drink were worth £63.1bn in 2024, as imports from the EU rose by 3.3% compared with a year earlier, and increased by 7.4% from non-EU countries.The EU remains the UK’s most important trading partner in the food and drink sector, accounting for almost two-thirds (61.8%) of exports and three-quarters (75.6%) of imports, worth nearly £45bn in 2024.Imports of EU produce rose despite theintroduction of new border checksfor arrivals of animal and plant products from the EU in April 2024.Food and drink imports entering the UK are still subject to fewer checks than UK businesses exporting equivalent products, the FDF said. It found that the UK’s small and medium-sized exporters are finding it particularly challenging to meet the EU’s “more stringent” import requirements.The FDF is calling on the government to work with the food and drink industry to take a strategic approach to trade relations with the EU and to address “unnecessary barriers” to trade with Europe.“These latest figures show the stark reality for the UK’s 12,500 food and drink businesses who are struggling to deal with the complexity and bureaucracy that comes when trading with Europe,” said Balwinder Dhoot, the director of industry growth and sustainability at the FDF.“Government must prioritise working with the EU, and our industry, to remove as many of these barriers as possible.”Global food export volumes increased by nearly 6% in 2024 compared with a year earlier, the FDF found, as the UK began to see the benefits of free trade agreements. In the first full year after theUK-Australia trade deal came into force, the value of UK exports to Australia increased by 9% to £429.5m in 2024.While Ireland and France remain the UK’s largest individual export markets, the US has climbed into third place after strong growth last year, as classic British products such as tea and biscuits prove popular.The FDF is hoping that a future UK-US trade deal would prevent the food and drink sector being caught up in any future tariffs, as Donald Trumpthreatened a 200% tariff on wine and champagnefrom EU countries on Thursday, in the latest threat of escalation in the global trade war started by the US president.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryTrade policyFarmingBrexitEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

I am not a criminal.”Asked to reaffirm that she had immunity, she told the officer: “Yes, I have a diplomatic passport.”According to her profile on the UN website, Mugambe was appointed to the body’s judicial roster in May 2023 – three months after police were called to her address in Oxfordshire.Mugambe will be sentenced on 2 May.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

She lost her seven-year-old son, Thiago, in the flood.More than 600,000 Brazilians, 46 local governments and about 2,000 businesses aresuing BHP over the disaster in a lawsuitworth up to £36bn.The lawsuit, one of the largest in English legal history, began in October and ended on Thursday with closing submissions.“I will produce a judgment as soon as I can,” the judge, Finola O’Farrell, said as she announced the end of the trial.Pamela Fernandes, 31, lost her five-year-old daughter, Manu. “The memories of Manu are always with me … it’s very difficult,” she said.Fernandes, who like Silva wore a T-shirt bearing her late child’s picture, said: “I want justice so that I can be at peace, so that my daughter can be at peace.”BHP said the London lawsuit duplicated legal proceedings and reparation and repair programmes in Brazil, and should be thrown out. It also said nearly $8bn (£6.2bn) had been paid to those affected through the Renova Foundation, with about $1.7bn going to claimants involved in the English case.BHP argues it did not own or operate the dam, which held mining waste known as tailings. It said a Brazilian subsidiary of its Australian holding company was a 50% shareholder in Samarco, which operated independently.The company also said it had no knowledge that the dam’s stability was compromised before it collapsed.‘You are killing us’: Mariana survivors face ill health, lost culture and a long wait for justiceRead moreThe Brazilian government signed a compensation deal with BHP, Vale and Samarco in October, but Tom Goodhead, the chief executive of Pogust Goodhead, has said victims of the disaster were not involved.Representing the claimants, he said on Thursday that the trial was about accountability.“If the company is [found liable], it will be the biggest victory for us … it would have been worth waiting 10 years,” Silva said.Explore more on these topicsMiningBrazilBHPAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But when two shipments of steel from Marcegaglia Stainless Sheffield were slowed up in crossing the ocean by storms this week it meant more than a few days’ extra journey: the metal was caught up in the global trade war started by the US president,Donald Trump, as well.“Obviously, it’s a massive frustration,” says Liam Bates, the president of long products at the Italian steelmaker’s northern England operation. The company had hoped to rush through two weekly shipments in order to avoid theWednesday deadline for Trump’s 25% tariffson steel and aluminium. Instead, it will have to bear the costs – or hope for grace from the US government.The tariffs have put the US’s trading partners, including the UK, in a tricky situation. They are being pulled in two directions: some want trade war retaliation, while others want “pragmatic” negotiation in the hope that the changeable Trump can be persuaded to ease the levies.The EU’s response was swift. The bloc immediately retaliated withrevived levies on all-American productssuch as bourbon whiskey, jeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, and the promise of more onan array of other productsincluding makeup, chicken, beef and metals.Yet the UK is taking the second path: keeping its head down, and hoping it can persuade the mercurial and deal-driven Trump to change his mind.Keir Starmer told parliament on Wednesday he was “disappointed”, while adding that the UK would “take a pragmatic approach” as ittried to negotiate a deal with the US. “But we will keep all options on the table,” he said, leaving open the possibility of future retaliation.Chris Southworth, the UK secretary general for the International Chamber of Commerce, a business group, says the UK government will come under “tremendous pressure” to retaliate, and it may still do so. However, Starmer’srelative success in mollifying Trumpmay open the way to talks that could roll back tariffs for the UK.“What they’ll be trying to do is avoid going head to head,” he says. The UK, as a “pragmatic broker”, could “try to shift the focus off tariffs, where neither of us win”. However, “it’s a tricky balance”, he adds.Graph showing the 13 biggest exporters of steel to the US, ranked in descending orderIt is not the first time that the Labour government has taken a relatively conciliatory stance on trade since it took power in July: it has also so far declined to impose tariffs on Chinese car imports, even asthe US and EU have done so.Carmakers with UK operations appear much more concerned to avoid retaliation from China – the world’s biggest car market – than on preventing Chinese products from coming into the UK. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has opposed the idea of tariffs on Chinese cars, and is not aware of any appeals from companies for investigation to the UK’s Trade Remedies Authority, the first step to imposing tariffs.A source close to government negotiations said the UK was taking a different approach to the EU because “active and intense” trade negotiations could come up with something.“Coming to an actual agreement is a better weapon in our arsenal,” the source said. However, if talks with the US fail, the government would definitely consider quotas or tariffs for the steel industry.Hoping for a good result from talks may not satisfy businesses. One key effect is the possibility of trade diversion: when exporters try to find new markets when their originals are closed. The steel industry shared its concerns with the business and trade secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, on Wednesday.Gareth Stace, the director general of UK Steel, a lobby group, argues that the government should act quickly to prevent trade diversion, to match the speed of the EU, which is set to tighten protections within days.“The need for quickness doesn’t seem to have landed enough,” Stace says, referring to protections against other countries dumping steel in the UK once the US market is closed. He says the UK should “rip up the rulebook and get on with” protecting the sector.However, Stace strongly praised the government’s efforts to persuade the US: “We’re your friend, not your foe.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That disparity means that the UK, no longer part of the EU, is not likely to be an economic priority for Trump – although there is a chance it could help the UK to win concessions.The Indian-owned Tata Steel, which runs the vast Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales, has great influence with the UK government because it will once again become the country’s largest steel producer when it replaces itsnow-shut blast furnaces with electric arc furnaces. A spokesperson said that the UK must add safeguard measures to “avoid cheaper imports flooding our market and pushing down prices as competitors look to redirect steel originally destined for the US”.Another steel industry executive, whose business exports about 10% of its products to the US, says Trump’s argument for restrictions on the vast supply from China in particular was “something that I don’t totally disagree with”. He argued that “trade remedies to protect our own industry” would help to avoid undercutting by Chinese steelmakers, which are desperate to find buyers amid weak domestic demand.View image in fullscreenTrump has said his tariffs will mean a ‘period of transition’ for the global economy.Photograph: Nathan Posner/Rex/ShutterstockYet not everybody is a fan of immediately moving to protectionism – not least because it could reduce export opportunities if everyone starts to pull up the drawbridge.Bates said he believes the same is true of UK retaliation against the US, which could inflame the situation and lead to tit-for-tat tariffs that could block export markets completely.“At the moment it feels like a better way to see if a deal could be done,” he said.The irony of Trump’s tariffs for Marcegaglia is that they will make things more difficult for its US operations in South Carolina, where 65 employees roll steel shapes known as billets and blooms into products for cars, construction and the oil industry.Trump’s argument when faced by global stock market turmoil in recent days is that there will be a“period of transition”– and maybe even a recession – while businesses are forced to shift manufacturing to the US, “reshoring” jobs. However, that is not an option for Marcegaglia because it does not have a “critical mass” in the US to justify the investment in another melt shop.“It’s quite extraordinary how anyone thinks this will do anything other than damage the US,” says the ICC’s Southworth. “It’s hard to think that anyone is looking at the US as a reliable partner.”Explore more on these topicsSteel industryTrump tariffsInternational tradeDonald TrumpTrump administrationEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The “first-of-a-kind” treatment, which was initially rejected by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), works by blocking the specific hormones that contribute to endometriosis while providing necessary hormone replacement.The medication eliminates the need for multiple medications and regular trips to clinics for injections.Unlike current injectable treatments which can initially worsen symptoms, the pill can be taken at home, works more quickly and combines hormones in one pill.Endometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the womb lining grows elsewhere, such as the ovaries and fallopian tubes, and can affect fertility and other pelvic organs.Symptoms include pain during periods, bowel movements, urination and sex. It is thought to affect about one in 10 women of reproductive age.Endometriosis care has also long been recognised as substandard, with a previous report finding that on average women arewaiting nearly nine years for a diagnosis in the UK.The treatment will be available through routineNHScommissioning for those that medical or surgical treatment for endometriosis has failed. The medication has also already been recommend by Nice for treating moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids.A spokesperson for Endometriosis UK welcomed the decision by Nice, adding: “Endometriosis UK believes that women and those assigned female at birth in the UK should be able to choose the right treatment and management options for them.“We recommend that treatment decisions are always made in partnership with the individual and their medical practitioner. There are far too few options available due to the historic lack of research into endometriosis.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The treatment can also be stopped and started more easily, which is particularly important for those planning to have children and for managing side effects. This convenience not only benefits patients but reduces pressure on NHS services.”Dr Sue Mann, the NHS’s national clinical director for women’s health, said: “This first-of-a-kind treatment for endometriosis – a condition which can be extremely debilitating – will give women greater control of their own health by potentially allowing them to get the treatment they need in the comfort of their own homes, without the need to attend regular appointments.”Explore more on these topicsEndometriosisHealthWomen's healthNHSNational Institute for Health and Care ExcellenceWomenEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He promised to issue the constitutional declaration to serve as a “legal reference” during the transition period.The Kurdish-led administration in north-eastern Syria sharply criticised the declaration, saying it “contradicts the reality of Syria and its diversity”.Earlier this week, the Syrian Democratic Forces – the Kurdish-led administration’s de facto army –struck a deal with the authorities in Damascus to be integrated into state institutions.But the administration on Thursday said the declaration “does not represent the aspirations of our people” and “undermines efforts to achieve true democracy”.The text of the declaration states: “Calls for division and separatism, requests for foreign intervention, or reliance on foreign powers are criminalised,” without offering specifics.It adds, however, that the government “seeks to coordinate with relevant countries and entities to support the reconstruction process”.A UN spokesperson quoted the special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, as saying he “hopes the [constitutional] declaration can be a solid legal framework for a genuinely credible and inclusive political transition”, adding “proper implementation will be key”.The declaration comes a week after the deadly rash of violence on Syria’s coast, in what analysts described as the gravest threat so far to the transitional process.Mass killings mainly targeted Alawites, resulting in at least 1,476 civilian deaths at the hands of the security forces and their allies, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.Sharaa has vowed to prosecute those behind the bloodshed, and the authorities have announced several arrests.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

This included filming and photographing public stripping, nudity and sexualised abuse and torture, and sharing images online.0:56Footage shows Palestinian men stripped to underwear after detention in Gaza – videoMost perpetrators of sexual and gender-based violence listed in the report were members of the armed forces or working in detention centres, but they also included Israeli settlers targeting Palestinians.The chair of the commission that drew up the report, Navi Pillay, said Israel’s failure to investigate or prosecute abuses created a culture of impunity.Israel last monthsentenceda soldier to seven months for severe assaults of Palestinian detainees, the first conviction for abuse in the detention system. Nine other soldiers were arrested last yearover allegations of sexual abuse so violent it left a detainee in a critical condition, but they have not gone on trial.Pillay said: “The exculpatory statements and actions by Israeli leaders and the lack of effectiveness shown by the military justice system to prosecute cases and convict perpetrators send a clear message to members of the Israeli security forces that they can continue committing such acts without fear of accountability.“In this context, accountability through the international criminal court and national courts, through their domestic law or exercising universal jurisdiction, is essential if the rule of law is to be upheld and victims awarded justice.”The ​UN’s international court of justiceorderedthe Israeli government to ensure its forces did not commit acts of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza in January 2024.Israel is party to the genocide convention, but not the Rome statute under which the international criminal court has jurisdiction to rule on individual criminal cases involving genocide.The UN report also highlighted the “unprecedented scale” of female deaths in Gaza as another gendered aspect of the violence. Israeli attacks have killed more than 48,000 people in Gaza, 33% of them women and girls.That is a higher proportion than during Israel’s past wars in Gaza, caused by “an Israeli strategy of deliberately targeting residential buildings and using heavy explosives in densely populated areas”, the report said.Egypt and Hamas officials on Thursday welcomed comments from Donald Trump that Palestinians would not be forced out of Gaza. “Nobody is expelling any Palestinians from Gaza,” the US president said after a White House meeting with the Irish prime minister, Micheál Martin.Trump has repeatedly called for the US to take ownership of the strip and rebuild it as a “riviera” for the Middle East without its Palestinian residents, suggesting they should move to neighbouring countries including Egypt.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesGenderViolence against women and girlsnewsShareReuse this content"

And, evidently, Maria Branyas Morera was right.A study of Branyas’s microbiome and DNA that scientists began conducting before her death reportedly determined that the genes she inherited allowed her cells to essentially feel and behave as if they were 17 years younger than they actually were. And Branyas’smicrobiota– which primarily refers to the bacteria in people’s guts that has a role in keeping them healthy – mirrored that of an infant, according to the research led by University of Barcelona genetics professor Manel Esteller, a leading expert on ageing.The daily newspaper Ara, which covers the Catalan region where she resided much of her life, first reported on the results of the study into what was described as Branyas’s “privileged genome” earlier in March. Esteller’s team found that Branyas retained her lucidity until almost the very end of her life.And the ailments that she grappled with during her extended golden years were largely limited to joint pain and hearing loss.Ara reported that Esteller’s work on Branyas amounts to the most complete research yet into a so-called supercentenarian – someone who is 110 or older – as well as some possible explanations for the longevity that marks some lives in particular.The researchers noted how Branyas made a number of healthy lifestyle choices that also helped her take advantage of her unique genetic makeup. She adhered to aMediterranean dietthat included three yogurts daily.She avoided drinking alcohol and smoking, enjoyed walks, and constantly surrounded herself with family and loved ones, all of which apparently aided her in staving off declines both physical and mental that could have shortened her life, the researchers concluded.Esteller and his colleagues said that they hope the study into Branyas provides useful information to those seeking to develop medications and treatments for age-related illnesses.They said Branyas exemplified how ageing and sickness – at least in certain conditions – do not necessarily have to go hand-in-hand. And the results of the genetic study done on her “challenge the perception that [the two] are inexorably linked”, they also said, according to Spain’s EFE news service.Branyas was born in San Francisco on 4 March 1907, after her parents moved from Spain and Mexico to the US. She also spent time in Texas and New Orleans before her family returned to Spain in 1915 – amid the first world war – and settled in Catalonia.Some of the major global events that she subsequently lived through were the Spanish civil war, the second world war, the 1918 flu pandemic and Covid-19.She made international news headlines by contracting Covid in 2020, when Spain was one of the countries hit hardest by the virus and protective vaccines were not yet available. But her Covid bout was asymptomatic, and she recovered relatively easily.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In response,Canadaand theEUhave put tariffs on American exports worth a total of over $40bn goods.Canadian and European leaders have vowed to not back down to Trump, even as he promises to slap on even more tariffs in response to any pushback. “We will not give in to threats,” said Laurent Saint-Martin, France’s foreign trade minister. “Donald Trump is escalating the trade war he chose to unleash.”The administration has shown it is willing to back down in some instances, at least temporarily. On Tuesday, Trump reversed plans to double the tariff on steel and aluminum imports from Canada to 50% after Ontario’s premier dropped plans to place tariffs on electricity exports to the US. Last week, Trump delayed the 25% tariffs he planned to put on all Mexican and Canadian imports until the start of April.Still, Trump and those within his administration have played down concerns about the lasting impacts the tariffs will have on the US economy. US treasury secretary Scott Bessent toldCNBCon Thursday that the administration was focused on the “long-term gains in the market and long-term gains for the American people”.Global stock markets register heavy falls as White House tries to talk up Trump tariffsRead more“I’m not concerned about a little bit of volatility over three weeks,” Bessent said.The US stock market saw a brief moment of reprieve on Wednesday after February’s inflation report showed that price increases weren’t as bad as expected. But stocks started to drop again after Canada and the EU placed tariffs on American exports.Amid uncertainty around Trump’s trade policies, officials with the US Federal Reserve are expected to hold interest rates steady at their upcoming meeting next week, which is unlikely to improve sentiment on Wall Street.Explore more on these topicsStock marketsTrump administrationTrump tariffsUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

In a newsletter sent to residents on Tuesday, Meiner condemned the film as “a false one-sided propaganda attack on the Jewish people that is not consistent with the values of our City and residents”.No Other Land directors criticise US as they accept documentary Oscar: ‘US foreign policy is helping block the path’ to peaceRead moreMeiner had previously urged the O Cinema to cancel scheduled screenings of the documentary, citing criticism from Israeli and German officials. According to the mayor’s newsletter, O Cinema’s CEO, Vivian Marthell, allegedly agreed to withdraw the film from programming, citing “concerns of antisemitic rhetoric”, but Meiner claimed she reversed her decision the following day. The screenings sold out and the cinema added additional dates in March.“Our decision to screen NO OTHER LAND is not a declaration of political alignment. It is, however, a bold reaffirmation of our fundamental belief that every voice deserves to be heard,” Marthelltold the Miami Herald.The documentary, which won the Academy Award for best documentary feature last week, follows the destruction of Palestinian villages in the occupiedWest Bankand chronicles the unlikely friendship between a Palestinian activist, Basel Adra, and Israeli journalist, Yuval Abraham, who co-directed the film.Abraham responded to the Guardian’s reporting on Meiner’s efforts on Thursday, writing: “Banning a film only makes people more determined to see it.”“Once you witness Israel’s ethnic cleansing of Masafer Yatta it becomes impossible to justify it, and that’s why the mayor is so afraid of our film,” Abraham said in a post on social media.Tensions over free speech and Palestinian activism nationwide have been further heightened this week after Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia student activist and green-card holder who helped lead the Palestinian solidarity movement during the college encampments last year, was detained by immigration authorities. The US president, Donald Trump, has alleged without evidence that Khalil has links to “pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity”.A White House official told the Free Press that Khalil, who was arrested without charge, poses a “threat to the foreign policy and national security interests of the United States” and the “allegation here is not that he was breaking the law”.A recent Gallup pollshows support for Israel has plummeted to a 25-year low, while Palestinian sympathy has surged.Kristen Rosen Gonzalez, a Miami Beach commissioner, said she shared the mayor’s negative assessment of the film but cautioned against a “kneejerk reaction” that could trigger “costly legal battles”, and noted O Cinema’s “longstanding commitment to the Jewish community”.The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida has called the mayor’s retaliation against O Cinema unconstitutional. “The government does not get to pick and choose which viewpoints the public is allowed to hear, however controversial some might find them,” Daniel Tilley, the branch’s legal director,told Axios.‘A chilling effect’: is Hollywood too scared to touch hot-button documentaries?Read moreFree speech advocates are also mobilizing against what they see as dangerous government overreach targeting constitutional rights.“Screening movies to make sure they conform to local censors’ tastes is a practice we left behind with the red scare,” said Adam Steinbaugh, an attorney at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (Fire).“If the first amendment doesn’t mean that a movie theater can show an Oscar-winning film, something is seriously wrong.”Miami Beach has faced past controversy over artistic expression in 2019, when the cityremoved a portraitof Raymond Herisse, a Black man fatally shot by Beach police, from a city art project.The mayor’s proposal to cancel the cinema’s lease is set for a commission vote next Wednesday.Explore more on these topicsFloridaDocumentary filmsNo Other LandWest BankPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Versace will not leave the company – instead she will become chief brand ambassador, looking after (among other roles) philanthropy and red carpet dressing. Of the new role, Donatella said: “I will remain Versace’s most passionate supporter. Versace is in my DNA and always in my heart.”Versace, the youngest and only daughter of a dressmaker in Reggio Calabria, was born in 1955, a decade after her eldest brother, Gianni. Though she left home to study in Florence, along with Santo, the middle brother who ran the business side, she was very much involved in the family business as a supporter and a muse to her brother. By 1989, aged 34, she began working at Atelier Versace, and by 1993 had sole creative responsibility for Versus, Versace’s cheaper diffusion line.It was after the murder of Gianni in 1997 – the 50-year-old designer was shot outside his home in Miami Beach – that Donatella, unexpectedly, was propelled into the top job. Despite having no formal fashion training, she inherited a $807m (£623m) business and 130 shops worldwide. Talking about that time in the Guardian in 2017, she said: “For the first five years, I was lost … I made a lot of mistakes.I would tell myself … don’t try to be Gianni!”At its height, under Gianni, Versace specialised in an aesthetic, synonymous with “flashion” and vulgarity and starry front rows. But with a knack for telling a story through the clothes themselves, Donatella became just as entwined with the look.One of the few brands with a designer who is as much a visual ambassador of the clothes as the customer – not to mention one of the few women in a top job at a fashion house – Versace not only wore the brand, but became it. Instantly recognisable, in2015she even briefly appeared as the face of Givenchy.View image in fullscreenJennifer Lopez, with Donatella Versace, in the plunging ‘jungle’ dress that inspired so many searches it inspired Google to create Google Images.Photograph: Luca Bruno/APAlthough Versace’s status in popular culture rose on Gianni’s watch – he designed Liz Hurley’s safety-pin dress and choreographed the 1991 show in which the supermodels Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford and Linda Evangelista lip-synched to George Michael’s Freedom on the catwalk – it was consolidated by Donatella, who went on to work closely with Madonna and design, among other things, interiors, hotels and Jennifer Lopez’s plunging “jungle” dress worn to the Grammy’s in 2000.

In the statement on Thursday, John D Idol, the chief executive officer of Capri Holdings which owns Versace as well as Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo, called the decision “part of a thoughtful succession plan”.It is also thought that the Prada group, which owns Miu Miu,wants to buy Versaceand has an exclusive bidding window on the brand – and that Vitale will provide a new wave of energy. During his tenure at Miu Miu, the brand recorded a 58% increase in revenue, to €649m (£544m). Sales were up 93% last year.Vitale is not a well known name in fashion. But he had been rumoured to be a contender for roles at Bottega Veneta and Gucci.

However, itsrulesbar content that makes “dehumanising” statements about a person or groups based on protected characteristics such as gender, identity or sex. Content targeting an individual or group for harassment or abuse is also barred.Several Tate podcasts containing offensive or questionable content remain on Spotify platform, including a “PhD course” on “how to get girls fast and easy”.This episode contains “iron clad” rules for dating women, including never allowing a woman to be friends with men and referring to dating as a “sexual marketplace”.He goes on to say the “reason the sexual marketplace is so fucked is because there’s too many women out there who get attention without giving sex”. Later, he claims that men must “build” a woman to be perfect for them, saying: “A woman who is understanding and kind and respects you does not exist, unless you force her to be that way.”He calls some women “more mouldable” than others.Another episode titled “Willing and Able” with his brother, Tristan Tate, was released after their time in prison in Romania, which they refer to as “unfair” and a “matrix attack”.A petition onchange.orgcalling on Spotify to remove Tate’s podcasts has reached more than 92,000 signatures. The petition accuses the streaming company of “cashing in on the exploitation of women and girls”.The Tate brothers, both dual British-US nationals, face charges of rape, human trafficking and other offences in Romania. They are also wanted by UK authoritiesinvestigating allegations of rape and human trafficking. Last month they flew to the US after Romanian prosecutorssuspended a travel banand a court lifted a precautionary seizure on some of their assets.The brothers have denied all the allegations against them and say their wealth has made them targets. “I’m sure at the end we’ll be absolutely exonerated,” Tate said last year.It emerged last week that Kyle Clifford, a former soldier,watched up to 10 Tate videosbefore he murdered Louise Hunt, 25, her sister Hannah, 28, and their mother, Carol, 61, at their home in Bushey,Hertfordshire, last year.In 2022, musician Neil Young removed his music catalogue from Spotify because Joe Rogan’s podcasts were being platformed on Spotify and called Spotify “the home of life-threatening Covid misinformation”.However, he returned to the platform in 2024 as Rogan’s podcast was allowed to be distributed to other platforms including ApplePodcastsand YouTube.Young said he could not protest on all platforms as his music would not be able to be streamed anywhere.Tate’s legal representatives have been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsAndrew TateSpotifyGenderPodcastsnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump has meanwhile repeatedly called forCanadato become the 51st US state – a taunt seen by some north of the border as an annexation threat.The new rule was published on the Federal Registrar on Wednesday as freshUS tariffsof 25% came into effect onsteel and aluminum– widely seen as a blow to Canada, which already faces a separate 25% levy on other goods. Canada, in turn,announced retaliatory tariffson nearly C$30bn worth of American imports.It will probably affect the estimated 900,000 Canadians – known colloquially as “snowbirds” – who spend winters in warmer southern US states such as Florida, Texas and South Carolina.The Department of Homeland Security estimates that between 2.2 million and 3.2 million people will be affected by the new visitor registration rules.The immigration attorney Rosanna Berardi said: “It’s important to clarify that this measure specifically impacts Canadian citizens crossing land borders who intend to remain in the United States for periods exceeding 30 days.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An expanded group of far-right and far-left MPs could oppose it in the new Bundestag, a “blocking minority” Merz is keen to avoid.Can Europe defend itself alone? – podcastRead moreAmid expectations that Germany will relax a key element of its strict fiscal rules known as the “debt brake”, its allies have responded favourably and markets have rallied.

He asked the Greens: “What more do you want from us in so short a time?”View image in fullscreenBritta Haßelmann accused Merz of ‘bad manners’.Photograph: Lisi Niesner/ReutersMerz stressed his belief in the urgency of investing in security. “We have to do something to improve our defensive capabilities, and quickly,” he said, describing a “truly worrying security situation in Europe”. Germany must “do something now … Anything else would be irresponsible,” he added.The Greens’ parliamentary co-leader Britta Haßelmann accused Merz of “bad manners”, saying he had not sought a proper, respectful conversation with her party but had instead simply left a message on her voicemail.Before the nearly four-hour debate, the Greens had indicated that negotiations were at a stalemate, with senior figures citing “grave flaws” in the legislation, including the lack of prominence it gave to climate policies.Throughout the debate, Merz was accused of wanting to use the new money to finance projects that would please the new government’s conservativeand SPD voter base, and was repeatedly called on to provide guarantees, including commitments to much-needed reforms, as well as extra cash to renovate hospitals, schools and kindergartens.View image in fullscreenHeidi Reichinnek of Die Linke.Photograph: Liesa Johannssen/ReutersIn a blistering attack, Heidi Reichinnek of Die Linke accused Merz’s conservatives and the SPD of being “undemocratic”, convening the old Bundestag “because you’re dissatisfied with the election results”.Both the far-right Alternative für Deutschland and Die Linke lodged complaints with the constitutional court before the debate, which could deliver its ruling this week.Merz has argued that raising defence spending has become a matter of urgency because of Russia’s invasion ofUkraine, not just for Germany but for the whole of Europe. With Donald Trump in the White House, he has argued, the continent must become more independent.Economists have described Merz’s multibillion-euro package as everything from a “bazooka” to “an extremely risky bet”, while he has called it vital “in light of the threats to our freedom and peace on our continent”.The second and third readings of the government’s plans will take place next Tuesday, before heading to the upper house.Over the coming days Merz will continue to negotiate with the Greens, according to his party officials.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropeFriedrich MerzUkraineRussiaThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

Netflix released the first previews of the new installment on Thursday, teasing “six electrifying stories” premiering on 10 April.The trailer continues Black Mirror’s trademark uneasy, foreboding tone, previewing several new entries in a universe of tech gone awry. New stars includePeter Capaldi, Issa Rae, Paul Giamatti, Rashida Jones, Tracee Ellis Ross, Emma Corrin, Awkwafina, Chris O’Dowd and more.And breaking from precedent, the anthology series will revisit at least a few previous stories in the new chapter, as the trailer shows Cristin Milioti and other characters from then standout season 4 episode USS Callister continue their virtual voyage. Milioti will reprise her role as Nanette Cole, a computer programmer unwittingly roped into a video game by her sinister boss Robert Daly (Jesse Plemons).Though the original episode ended with the demise of Plemons’s character, several others survived, including Billy Magnussen’s Karl, Milanka Brooks’s Elena and Osy Ikhile’s Nate, all of whom will appear in the new season. Jimmi Simpson, who played a character seemingly sacrificed during the original episode, is also set to return.Other returning cast include Will Poulter and Industry’s Asim Chaudhry, who will return for their second Black Mirror stints each, in new storylines, after starring in the 2018 interactive specialBandersnatch.“We’re doing some things we’ve not done before,” Brookersaidof the new episodes last year. “People can expect quite a lot of emotion and, hopefully, a good mix of chills. We did a couple of horror stories in season six, which we label as Red Mirror. But this time around, the episodes are all, in a way, like OG Black Mirror.

He has struggled a little since, from annoying Woody Harrelson-led comedyWilsonto ho-hum gay high school romanceAlex Strangelove, and so one can understand why Johnson might feel like a big swing in a different direction might make most sense.Novocaine review – throwaway one-joke action comedy brings the painRead moreIt has led him to a script by Saturday Night Live writer Kent Sublette called The Parenting, a throwback supernatural comedy horror that tries to remind us of a time when these rambunctious concoctions were far more common. Think Beetlejuice in the 80s or The Frighteners in the 90s or the deeply underratedHouseboundmore recently, a high-energy rush of scares and laughs that should feel effortless but too often doesn’t, the difficulty of such a balance perhaps serving to explain why so few are made these days. It might also explain why backers New Line didn’t quite know what to do with this one, the film gathering dust on the shelf for almost three years and now landing on Max with a suitably concerning trailer released less than two weeks prior.Said trailer ended up being an accurate representation of a film which starts off as an amiable comedy before going completely off the rails when it becomes a horror. It’s a shame as when the stakes are low and the genre more defined, there’s some fun to be had from the Meet the Parents adjacent set-up. It’s familiar sitcom territory – potential in-laws meeting potential in-laws for the first time – but centered on a gay couple instead, providing an added and less well-explored specificity. Rohan (Nik Dodani) and Josh (Brandon Flynn) have planned a weekend away, renting out a large, remote country house so their families can meet. Rohan’s adoptive parents are rich and a little snobbish (Edie FalcoandBrian Cox) while Josh’s are more working class and unrefined (Lisa Kudrowand Dean Norris).The initial escalation of tension – misunderstood names, inappropriate jokes, an overly amorous dog – edges from amusing to genuinely funny thanks to a cast blessed with a wealth of comedy experience. But as pleasing as it is to see pros like Falco and Kudrow engage in passive-aggressive sparring, it’s also a nice surprise to see how well Flynn handles himself, an actor whose limited credits have been almost entirely dramatic up until now. He is a remarkably light-footed comedian, bringing as many laughs as his older co-stars, even if he is lumped with modern comedy’s most exasperatingly overused cliche: the dreaded weed gummies. A plea to all screenwriters going forward: continue brainstorming if this is what you’ve come up with.What’s frustrating is that there could have been a broad yet funny, character-based comedy here if things had remained of this world. But as soon as a demon enters the picture, summoned by a wifi password and entering the body of Cox’s no-nonsense dad, things start to disintegrate. The standard of jokes takes a sharp nosedive, as puerile lowbrow farce replaces relatably awkward humour, and even a game cast struggles to handle the silliness of it, grimly trying to make fart and dick jokes work. As things get goofier, the only actor able to truly sell any of it is Parker Posey, playing the owner of the house whose presence becomes a saving grace, the actor able to turn the slightest of movements or pronunciations into a laugh-out-loud moment.But while she is able to swiftly identify and nail the exact right tone, everyone else starts to scramble. As a comedy, it stops being funny and as a horror it never starts being scary with Johnson’s direction far too drab and lifeless for something so cartoonish and schlocky. Big swing, bigger miss.The Parenting is now available on Max in the US, Binge in Australia and in the UK at a later dateExplore more on these topicsComedy filmsBrian CoxComedyHorror filmsEdie FalcoLisa KudrowHBOreviewsShareReuse this content"

Is there any particular genre that you haven’t tackled already butwould like to?LickyKickyI don’t care about genre. What interests me is first the story. When I have the story, I try to find the best genre with which to communicate it. So the genre arrives second, and very often I mix them.8 Womenwas not a musical to begin with. That was based on a play. Abadplay. Old-fashioned. But I loved the plot: eight women and one of them is a murderer. It was my idea to make it a musical because it was a way to be democratic. To give each character the chance to express herself with a song, with a dance. With all those actresses together, there might be one scene where, say,Isabelle Huppertis merely an extra in the background. And you say: “Isabelle, don’t move! Now Catherine, say your lines.” Isabelle loved it butCatherine Deneuvedidn’t get what I was trying to do. When she saw the film, she understood. But during the shoot, it was too theatrical for her.8 Women was very successful, and Catherine and I met again afterwards – we are human beings, we are able to talk, sometimes we have problems but we explain ourselves. Maybe our next film,Potiche, was easier for her because she was the main woman rather than one of eight. Also, she knew what kind of movie I wanted to make this time.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Ludivine Sagnier, Virginie Ledoyen, Catherine Deneuve, Danielle Darrieux, Isabelle Huppert, Firmine Richard and Emmanuelle Béart all starred in in 8 Women (2002).Photograph: Jean-Claude Moireau/Canal +/Fidelite Prods/Kobal/ShutterstockI treasure Potiche. Any plans for a sequel? I’d love to see the continuing exploits of the Pujol umbrella factory.JackFenwickThat would be funny because the film happened during the 1970s. The sequel could be in the 1980s. That’s an idea. But I’m not sure it’s possible to shoot again a film withGérard Depardieuwith all the problems he has today. He’s a great actor but now it’s difficult to finance a film with him. I haven’t made a sequel to my films but I know there is an Italian remake of 8 Women on Netflix. But now it’s 7 Women [7 Women and a Murder] because they cut out the Black character. It’s all white Italian women. And it’s not a musical, it’s just a whodunnit. So [raises eyebrow] I will let you see it for yourself.View image in fullscreenCatherine Deneuve in Potiche (2010), a comedy about a housewife who blossoms when she takes over her husband’s umbrella factory.Isabelle Huppert was recently asked:“Can a film change someone’s life?” She said:“Maybe it can change someone’s day.”Would you like to make films that change livesor is it enough for you to change a single day?Dmitry SFor me it’s about helping. I made a film which was very helpful for many people –By the Grace of God[about real-life cases of child abuse by Catholic priests in France]. It was not my goal; it was not what I set out to do. But it was a huge success in France. I had so many testimonies from people after they saw the film and it was so touching to hear people coming out about what they lived through as children. That’s when I realised the film had helped many people. Some were not able to speak out, but after watching it, they went to the police or told their family what happened to them.View image in fullscreenBy The Grace of God (2018), which explores the scandal of child abuse by priests.My original idea for this film was to make a documentary, because I loved the real people who told me their stories. I had conversations with the whole families: the children, the wives. But when I said, “I want to make a documentary about your story,” they said: “Please, no.” I realised they were only able to give me all this information because I was a fiction director. And they were waiting for me to make a kind ofSpotlight.After the brilliantIn the Houseand nowWhen Autumn Falls,I would like to ask: are you the reincarnation ofClaude Chabrol? Because it looks very much like you are carrying on his themes of good people doing bad things or bad people doing good things.jeroenspeculaasChabrol inspired me because he went in many directions and had a way of making movies which is very close to mine. There is a lot of pleasure in his films. He enjoyed telling stories. LikeFassbinder, it was not about making a masterpiece each time. I loveStanley Kubrick, too, but I feel closer to Chabrol and Fassbinder, who made many movies.I met Chabrol when he was filming The Girl Cut in Two. He was very sweet. He knew my films and complimented me on Under the Sand. I was touched. Actually, I met two directors of the Nouvelle Vague: Chabrol andEric Rohmer, who was my teacher. I’m closer to them than to Truffaut or Godard. Oh, Godard – I met him too! He came to my film school,La Fémis. And he was very mean in terms of money. Obsessed with money. Not generous like Chabrol or Rohmer, who wanted to communicate their passion. Cinema has to deal with money; it’s part of the job. But I was so surprised hearing Godard speaking only about money. I was waiting for something more intellectual.You’ve worked with so many iconic French stars. Are there any icons left that you still want to work with?Kal 85What will happen will happen. I know some directors make first the casting and after they try to find the story, but it’s not my way of working.I need first to have the story, to develop the script, and then I look for actors. But there are some counter-examples, such as Potiche, where I already knew Catherine. Before I started that script, I asked her if it was possible for her to be a “potiche” – a trophy wife. She said: “Why not?” Without her acceptance, I wouldn’t have made the film. But usually I work first on the script. When I wroteUnder the Sand, I had in mind a woman of 50 years old who was beautiful and who would agree to be in a swimsuit on the beach. And all the French actresses said no! I proposed the film first toIsabelle Adjani. When I worked with her much later on Peter von Kant, I said: “Do you remember?” And she said: “I never even read the script.”‘I never really learned anything from anybody’: Isabelle Huppert on 50 years in filmRead moreBut I had metCharlotte Ramplingata party and I thought she was beautiful. Everybody said: “Don’t work with her. She’s finished.” When Under the Sand was successful, that felt like a great revenge. And for Charlotte, it was a new start for her career. When I met with her and her agent to offer the role, I said: “I want to see Charlotte Rampling doing the vacuuming.” A very bad idea to say that at the first meeting. Her agent kicked me under the table! So that was a bad start. But she trusted me and we had a beautiful relationship. When she realised she would not be one of the eight women in 8 Women, she said: “That’s not a problem. Because I was the one woman in Under the Sand.”How do you look atPedro Almodóvar’srecent career, and do you have any ambitions like him [in The Room Next Door] to make an American adventure?ZaropansI love Pain and Glory. I thought it was a beautiful movie. Very personal and very honest. I was mixed about The Room Next Door. The fact that it was not in Spanish, I think, made him less comfortable with the dialogue. It can be difficult when you don’t have the ear for the language. That was the case for me when I made Angel, which was in English and was a big flop. In France, cinema is more important than everything, so we work all together for the film. And when I worked in England, I had the feeling everybody worked just for their own little area. By the way, people were surprised when I cast Michael Fassbender because he was not famous at that time. “Why this actor?” they said. But I loved Michael – he was beautiful and clever, and very involved.View image in fullscreenOzon in 2002, when he made 8 Women.Photograph: Mars Distribution/AllstarAs for working in the American system, I think it is difficult, especially for the French. There are some female directors right now who have done very well. ButCoralie Fargeatshot The Substance in France, remember, and I think with English money, no? [It was a Working Title production.] When you are used to working in the French system with final cut, the American way can be hard. I came close to working in Hollywood but there was not a lot of imagination in what I was being offered: after Swimming Pool, I was sent many scripts of erotic thrillers. But I don’t want to repeat myself. And I realised that in America, the producer is the master of the film and the director is just a technician. François Truffaut said that Americans respect you when you work in your own country, but when you work in their country, they destroy you.When Autumn Falls [When Fall Is Coming in the US] is in UK and Irish cinemas from 21 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmThe reader interviewFrançois OzonCharlotte RamplingIsabelle HuppertCatherine DeneuveinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Its dazzling performances, and the devastating questions it asks, will linger with youLucy ManganThu 13 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 13 Mar 2025 07.28 EDTShareIn the late 80s, there was a trilogy of dramas by Malcolm McKay called A Wanted Man. It starred Denis Quilley and Bill Paterson and at the centre had the most phenomenal performance by Michael Fitzgerald as Billy, a man arrested for gross indecency who comes to be suspected of the murder of a child. The first instalment followed his interrogation by a detective (Quilley), the second his trial and the third its aftermath. It was, and remains, the most devastating and immaculately scripted and played series I have ever seen – as close to televisual perfection as you can get.There have been a few contenders for the crown over the years, but none has come as close as Jack Thorne’s and Stephen Graham’s astonishing four-part series Adolescence, whose technical accomplishments – each episode is done in a single take – are matched by an array of award-worthy performances and a script that manages to be intensely naturalistic and hugely evocative at the same time. Adolescence is a deeply moving, deeply harrowing experience.Is this the most terrifying TV show of our times? Adolescence, the drama that will horrify all parentsRead moreIt begins with the police bursting into 14-year-old Jamie Miller’s family home and arresting him on suspicion of murdering his classmate Katie the night before. The first two episodes immerse us in the world of the police station, procedural detail and the detectives’ building of the case against Jamie (Owen Cooper), although he denies involvement.He chooses his dad, Eddie (Stephen Graham), as his appropriate adult. We will watch this man’s disbelief turn over the course of the 13-month period of the story into unfathomable grief. It is no spoiler to say that Jamie killed Katie – the evidence is given to us early and incontrovertibly. The drama’s concern is with why. We are led into a teenage world that is lived primarily online and which adults are, whatever they might think, incapable of properly monitoring or understanding.DI Luke Bascombe (Ashley Walters, supremely good, especially at capturing the essential bleakness of a job that may or may not bring justice, but will never restore a dead child to her parents) only really begins to understand the possible “why” when his own teenage son translates the emojis used in Katie’s comments under some of Jamie’s Instagram posts. The world of “incel” culture, the message spread between boys and young men about what they are entitled to expect and to take from girls and women, comes alive.Andrew Tate’sname is mentioned by adults as they try to get to grips with what they are learning, but the children don’t bother – it is just the water they swim in.The most astounding episode – of a dazzling quartet – is the penultimate, which consists almost entirely of a session between Jamie and a child psychologist, Briony (Erin Doherty), who has been sent to make the independent assessment required before the court case. Doherty’s signature cool and quick intelligence is perfectly deployed here as Briony nudges and corrals the boy by turns, pushing him closer and closer to truths he doesn’t want to acknowledge and the articulation of beliefs he barely knows he holds. She pins him at times like a butterfly to a card.And it’s here we should pause, as he goes toe-to‑toe with a woman who is surely emerging as one of the best actors of her generation, to note that this is 15-year‑old Cooper’s first role, won by sending a tape to the casting director, Shaheen Baig, who looked at 500 boys for the part. It’s an astonishing performance that lets us see the radicalised misogynist Jamie is or could yet become. But to do that with no previous experience is a testament to innate talent and the creative fostering that must have attended the entire shoot.If the final episode, which concentrates on the family’s desperate attempts to hold themselves together, feels slightly weaker, it is only in the context of what has gone before. Its refusal to offer easy get‑outs (no abusive parents, no dark family secrets), no clear explanation as to what leads one boy to murder and others not, feels brave and real. Adolescence asks who and what we are teaching boys and how we expect them to navigate this increasingly toxic and impossible world when our concept of masculinity still seems to depend on boys and men doing so alone. And it keeps the victim present enough that the question of how many girls and women will die while we try to work it all out stays with us, too.Adolescence is onNetflixnowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewDramaTelevisionStephen GrahamNetflixreviewsShareReuse this content"

The author narrates, in a fizzy historic present, her youthful idealism when she arrives atFacebook(now Meta) to work on global affairs in 2011, after a stint as an ambassador for New Zealand. Some years later she finds a female agency worker having a seizure on the office floor, surrounded by bosses who are ignoring her. The scales falling from her eyes become a blizzard. These people, she decides, just “didn’t give a fuck”.Mark Zuckerberg’s first meeting with a head of state was with the Russian prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, in 2012. He was sweaty and nervous, but slowly he acquires a taste for the limelight. He asks (unsuccessfully) to be sat next to Fidel Castro at a dinner. In 2015 he asks Xi Jinping if he’ll “do him the honor of naming his unborn child”. (Xi refuses.) He’s friendly with Barack Obama, until the latter gives him a dressing-down about fake news.In 2016, Facebook embeds staff in Donald Trump’s campaign “alongside Trump campaign programmers, ad copywriters, media buyers, network engineers, and data scientists”, helping him win. This inspires Zuckerberg to consider running for president himself, and he tours US swing states in 2017. Wynn-Williams describes his speeches as sounding “like what a kid thinks a president sounds like”. One goes: “The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, act anew.”Zuckerberg calls politicians unfriendly to Facebook ‘adversaries’ and instructs his team to apply pressure to ‘pull them over to our side’Meanwhile, in an effort to do business in China, his company has been offering the Chinese Communist party a “white-glove service”, and a genocide has occurred in Myanmar following a flood of false anti-Muslim stories posted on Facebook. In time Facebook abandons internet.org, its idea to give developing countries free access to the internet, or at least Facebook, pivots to the “metaverse”, a bad virtual-reality game populated by people who for a long time did not have legs, and finally pivots again to AI.Zuckerberg, in short, turns out to be a giant man-baby suffering from a severe case of the Dunning-Kruger effect, whereby people overestimate their own cognitive abilities. His colleagues obsequiously let him win at board games. He calls politicians unfriendly to Facebook “adversaries” and instructs his team to apply pressure to “pull them over to our side”. He blames his assistants when he forgets his own passport.Floating through the book like a toxic ice queen, meanwhile, is Facebook’s COO, Sheryl Sandberg. Wynn-Williams isn’t buying her “Lean In” talk. In one of two remarkable body-horror interludes in the book (the first is when she is almost eaten by a shark as a child), Wynn-Williams nearly dies in childbirth, but she is still harassed for work updates during her recovery. When she returns to the office her male boss gives her an unflattering performance review. “You weren’t responsive enough,” he says. “In my defense,” she replies, “I was in a coma for some of it.”This sounds like a job for a famous champion of women in the workplace. “Friends who have fallen for Sheryl’s Lean In schtick,” Wynn-Williams writes, “earnestly recommend going to her with my concerns.” But she is not convinced. She has already been sent to a Zika hotspot while heavily pregnant, and to Japan while pregnant again, to help promote Sandberg’s book.Wynn-Williams left Facebook in 2018 to work on “unofficial negotiations between the US and China on AI weapons”. Has the company’s office culture improved since then? A clue might be Zuckerberg’s recent appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast. He complains that corporate culture has become too “neutered” and needs a new injection of “masculine energy”. In February, he visited the White House to talk to Donald Trump about AI.Editor’s note: since this review was written Meta has responded to Wynn-Williams’ book, calling it “a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives”.Careless People by Sarah Wynn-William is published by Macmillan (£22).

The nine songs that make up La Bonne Chanson are all settings of poems by Paul Verlaine that Fauré shaped into a celebration of his love for the married Emma Bardac, who would later become the second wife of Claude Debussy.With immaculate French diction, Spence marvellously conveys the scarcely contained ecstasy of each song, his vocal lines beautifully cushioned by the strings of the Piatti Quartet and double-bass player. But the cycle occupies less than half the running time of the disc; the remainder is filled with a selection of other, mostly early Fauré songs, which includes such favourites as Lydia, En Sourdine and Clair de Lune, as well as the three settings that make up Poème d’un Jour, Op 21; all are delivered with equal finesse by Spence and pianist Julius Drake.Listen on Apple Music (below) orSpotifyAllow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted on embed.music.apple.com.

While the trends we have seen come to fruition in New York, London, Milan and Paris won’t start materialising in stores until late August, the styling hacks spotted on the catwalk will have more of an immediate impact. Especially those that are free. Here are nine to get you started.Grab aSharpie penView image in fullscreenBack to school … Coach’s autumn/winter look.Photograph: Armando Grillo/Gorunway.comSimilar to those school leavers signing shirts on the final day of classes, the shrunken T-shirts atCoachcame covered in freehand scribbles.

AtBurberry, models including the actor Richard E Grant walked the catwalk with a sprig ofEryngium planum, AKA sea holly, pinned to their lapels. It grows best, as the name suggests, by the seaside, but keep your eyes peeled for it around gravel gardens, too. Jeff Goldblum is already on it.

Sadly, despite almost certainly being more profitable than many a faded football club currently languishing in the lower reaches of the Premier League, the Thursday quiz has been quite unable to convince the government to also stump up a load of taxpayer cash as part of the deal to regenerate the neighbourhood.

I don’t think you can stop that. You might think I’m biased because I’m guilty of it, but it’s different for me and my wife, because one day we’ll choose between living here or in Canada. Here, we’re constantly told we can’t afford this or we can’t afford that. Do we have a need for social housing in this country? By the sounds of things, we have a need for quite a lot of social housing because, back in the 80s, Margaret Thatcher decided that every Englishman should have his own castle and flogged them all off.Dining across the divide: ‘She objected to people coming to the UK who haven’t been invited’Read moreJCFor me, it’s not so much about second or third homes, it’s properties standing empty. I feel the same about landlords who don’t maintain their properties. I gave passionate examples of younger colleagues of mine trying to find somewhere to live; just to rent, you have to bid over the asking price – it’s a real Squid Game scenario. I think he approves of social housing, but wants to shrink the state.BobSurely we need a new social housing building programme? After the second world war, Winston Churchill got dumped out of office because the people of the country said, “We’ve endured five years of hardship and war, where’s our reward?” Suddenly Attlee comes in, and despite the fact that we were bankrupt, we managed to start the NHS and the biggest housing programme we’ve ever seen. Broke or bankrupt, it’s all bollocks, isn’t it? You just have to take the long view.JCHe said you need to be bold and take risks, and what you need for that is strong leaders.

And I thought, listening to what he said, there’s a lot of similarity between engineering and medicine: it has to be evidenced; the consequences of getting it wrong are significant. I found him to be quite compassionate and insightful, I wouldn’t agree with the lack of empathy. I asked who said that, and he said, “My wife.”BobAs engineers, you’ve got to have a final physical thing that works. It’s not a set of ideas, it’s a finished item.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.For visitors in search of scenic walking routes, the province of North Holland is perhaps not an obvious choice. The landscape is famously as flat as the local pancakes and picturesque mountains, forests and waterfalls are in short supply.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Head into the countryside south of Amsterdam, however, and you can find lovely walking routes amid a quintessentially Dutch landscape of green fields, windmills and waterways. Walks along the Amstel River, which flows north into Amsterdam, also offer an opportunity to follow in famous footsteps. Rembrandt van Rijn lived for much of his life close to the river, was fond of walking its banks and produced some beautiful pictures here. With Amsterdam about to celebrate its 750th birthday in June, it’s a good moment to see the city from another angle, along the waterway which gave the city its name.AmsterdamMy walk in Rembrandt’s footsteps begins in Ouderkerk aan de Amstel, a small town a few miles south of Amsterdam. Ouderkerk isn’t big but it’s exceedingly pleasant; a warren of narrow brick streets cradled by the river, with a tall church tower standing at the centre like an upturned drawing pin. I don’t linger long but take a moment to see theBeth Haim Jewish cemetery, where dozens of old gravestones tilt in the soft grass. Nearby, streets are filled with diggers piling sandbags, and signs warning:Let op! Drijfzand(Watch out! Quicksand) – a reminder that much of the area I’ll be walking through was reclaimed from the water over many centuries, and remains below sea level today.Leaving Ouderkerk, I walk north along a narrow gravel footpath that tracks the Amstel like a handrail. It is a glorious sunny day, with birds flitting in and out of the tall rushes on the riverbank, and rowers skimming across the water like skittery insects. Yet despite all this movement, the Amstel itself is as tranquil as a mill pond – in a land without hills, you can barely tell many waterways are moving.View image in fullscreenRembrandt statue and De Riekermolen windmill.Photograph: Robert vant Hoenderdaal/AlamyAs I walk north, the Amstel is at first lined with terrace houses but the landscape soon opens out, with raised riverbanks offering views across the emerald fields beyond. During Amsterdam’s Golden Age in the 17th century, many of the city’s wealthy merchants owned weekend homes here. Today, most of the older homes have been replaced by modern mansions, but there’s still one magnificent 18th-century creation left, the Oostermeer, with a sweeping gravel drive. I take a photo and resolve that if my little book on Amsterdam turns out to be a bestseller, I’ll buy a palace here too.I see a view that hasn’t changed much since Rembrandt etched it in 1641: a rumpled meadow, a slender church tower, and a small boat on the riverContinuing north, I pass a stone obelisk as high as a house, engraved with the wordsTerminus Proscriptionis. Studying my map, I realise it is abanpaal(ban pole), marking the outer boundary of Amsterdam, which any criminal banned from the city would be forbidden to pass. Rembrandt, as a notorious spendthrift and love rat, may have been lucky to have avoided being banished himself. A mile or so later, on a big bend in the river, there’s a pretty windmill next to a big statue of Rembrandt kneeling on the grass in hat and cape, sketching on a pad that rests on his knee. Looking south, I see a view that hasn’t changed much since Rembrandt etched it in 1641: a rumpled meadow, a slender church tower in the distance, and a small boat sailing along the river.Five miles after leaving Ouderkerk, I arrive in Amsterdam proper. After the tranquillity of the countryside, the bustle of the city comes as a shock. The narrow riverside trail is replaced by wide streets with clanging trams, joggers, cars and cyclists. Here, the Amstel is perhaps half as wide as the River Thames, and lined with big old sailing barges converted into houseboats. Rembrandt sketched another picture showing this area, known as the Omval, with a massive tree standing like a gnarled fist by the river. Things look rather different these days. Just after midday on a weekday, restaurant terraces overlooking the Amstel are already filled with people drinking white wine and eating expensive salads. The Dutch work some of theshortest hours in Europe, and it shows.View image in fullscreenThe Night Watch by Rembrandt.Photograph: Peter Horree/AlamyI continue north, past theH’ART museum, which will host a Rembrandt exhibition from 9 April. Then I cross the river over the stately Blauwbrug, or blue bridge, which isn’t blue. Rembrandt drewa famous view of the Amstel from the Blauwbrugin the late 1640s, now in the Rijksmuseum. Looking west I see the grand waterside home of Rembrandt’s patron Jan Six, who commissioned many works. If you ask nicely, many weeks in advance (via theSix Collection website), you may be allowed inside to see theportrait Rembrandt did of Jan Sixin 1654, now hanging so Six appears to be keeping a watchful eye on the river.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The space is dominated by theWaag, a big turreted building. It was here that Rembrandt created one of his most famous works,The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp, showing doctors dissecting the corpse of an executed criminal. Nearby, on the Nieuwe Doelenstraat, you can also see the spot where Rembrandt delivered his most famous work:The Night Watch.View image in fullscreenThe pub Sluyswacht (on the right) is close to the Rembrandthuis.Photograph: Christophe Cappelli/AlamyI walk south along the Sint Antoniesbreestraat. My final stop is hard to miss: in a street of ugly modern buildings there’s one beautiful 17th-century facade; a five-storey brick mansion with red shutters on the windows like the doors on an Advent calendar. This is the house where Rembrandt lived for nearly two decades, nowa museum. The interior is largely a modern reconstruction but it’s hard not to feel a shiver of excitement when you see the sunlit studio where he painted some of history’s most famous art.The museum closes and I decamp to theSluyswacht, a pub just across the street in a little lockkeeper’s cottage which looks as if it’s been lifted from the pages of a fairytale. This place is not quite as old as Rembrandt – it was built 26 years after he died – but it is surely one of most picturesque pubs in Europe. I sit outside by the canal, drink apilsjeof beer and eat a plate of cheese, and think: that Rembrandt, he had good taste.The Invention of Amsterdam, A History of Europe’s Greatest City in Ten Walks by Ben Coates is published by Scribe UK (£12.99).To support the Guardian and the Observer buy a copy atguardianbookshop.com.

They switched careers: ‘I’m making twice as much money now’Former hospitality workers reflect on how the pandemic spurred job pivots – and big life changes – five years laterSupported byAbout this contentAdam ReinerThu 13 Mar 2025 13.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 13 Mar 2025 15.23 EDTShareFive years ago on 16 March, the sound of my cellphone buzzing on the nightstand jolted me awake around 8am. Unless you’re a morning prep cook or a baker, restaurant workers aren’t typically early risers.Sleepinglate isn’t a luxury when you work inrestaurants; it’s a necessity – essential to managing the job’s rigorous mental and physical demands.“I can’t believe I’m saying this, but we’re laying everyone off at the restaurant,” the gravelly voice on the other end said. “Someone from HR will be in touch with you shortly.” It was the general manager of the midtown Manhattan steakhouse where I had been waiting tables for over two years. Like most hard-nosed restaurant managers, he wasn’t known for being very sentimental. But that morning, he seemed genuinely remorseful.At the time, I could not possibly have known that I would never serve another table in a restaurant again. I had been working as a waiter in fine dining for over two decades, and a world without fancy places to eat was a contingency that no one could ever have predicted. But for many restaurant workers like me, the trauma of the pandemic led to epiphanies that forced us to reconsider our priorities and, for some, it became a catalyst for leaving the restaurant industry behind.When you’re in the grind, you don’t have a moment to think about whether it’s fulfillingAlice ChengThis month marks the fifth anniversary of theCovid-19lockdowns that spurred mass layoffs across the restaurant industry. During the first six months of the pandemic,over 100,000 restaurants closedacross the United States, many of them permanently, and more than5m restaurant jobswere lost. Government-mandated closures and capacity restrictions left hordes of restaurant workers in a lurch, causing many of them to defect from the industry in search of more secure employment.Even whileoverall hiring in the restaurant industry has reboundedto pre-pandemic levels, a majority of full-service independent restaurants still consider hiring and retaining high-quality staff a primary challenge. According to a recent survey by7 Shifts, 65% of restaurant operators characterize the labor market as “tight” or “very tight”, with 30% of respondents citing recruiting as their top concern.“The pandemic forced people to take a step back and breathe. When you’re in the grind, you don’t have a moment to think about whether it’s fulfilling,” said Alice Cheng, the founder ofCulinary Agents, a firm that specializes in job marketing for the hospitality industry. “A lot of people reprioritized. Some people started families. Some people relocated and realized that life was better wherever they moved.”Trading aprons for steady paychecksAfter working over a decade as a craft bartender in the Detroit area, Chas Williams dreamed of opening his own cocktail bar. He had amassed an impressive resume, including stints shaking tins at some of the most popular craft cocktail destinations in Detroit, such as Bad Luck Bar and The Oakland. In late 2018, Williams landed a dream job as lead bartender for three bar and restaurant venues inside the swanky Shinola Hotel in Detroit’s Woodward district. He would lose that job less than a year and a half later when the pandemic abruptly closed the hotel.Today, Williams is a carrier for the US Postal Service (USPS), one of myriad former restaurant workers who never returned to their jobs post-pandemic. He’ll be the first to admit that delivering mail is a significant departure from stirring up martinis and old fashioneds, but he’s learned to embrace the financial security and healthier work-life balance of his new career.“In bars and restaurants, you always have that stress of not really knowing how much money you’re going to make every day, every week or every month,” said Williams. “With this job, I know I’ll have at least 40 hours a week with overtime. And there’s the security of knowing exactly how much money I’ll make from how many hours I work.”After the pandemic, I think I realized what life could be likeKeira BakerWilliams credits the skills he honed behind the bar for helping him better serve neighborhood residents along his postal route every day, a dynamic that he compares to having bar regulars. “The idea of providing service to the community is something that I enjoyed about hospitality,” said Williams. “As a postal carrier, now I help bring things to people who are disabled or homebound and deliver products to folks who have small businesses – the real connection I feel to the community doing this work is very rewarding.”His transition to the public sector has been more lucrative than he expected, and the peace of mind that comes along with having more predictable income, healthcare coverage and retirement savings has been invaluable. “As a bartender or bar manager, I was usually making between $50,000 and $60,000 a year,” said Williams. “At the Postal Service, I’ve been making between $65,000 and $75,000 with much better benefits.”Government jobs have proven to be a popular refuge for displaced restaurant workers. One month before the pandemic shut down restaurants in Cincinnati, Mary Goodhew was feeling fatigued with her assistant manager job at a gourmet pizza restaurant where she had worked in various capacities for over 16 years. She was finally ready to take on a new challenge, but less than a month after she started working as a server in an upscale, chef-driven restaurant, she was unemployed.After bouncing around odd jobs such as a personal shopper and landscaper, Goodhew secured employment as a printer technician for the Ohio department of jobs and family services. Over a year into her new role now, she’s working fewer hours without taking a pay cut. “I’m making about 20% more than I made at my old restaurant job on average,” said Goodhew, “except that now I know exactly what my paycheck’s going to be, unlike when I was working for tips. I can budget better. I can save better. I can plan better. The security factor is really what I wanted.”Translating skills to a new industryForrest Seamons had a four-month-old baby girl when he was abruptly laid off his sommelier job at an upscale Manhattan restaurant in March 2020. After briefly returning to work later that year, he and his wife concluded that moving closer to her family would make it easier for them to raise their daughter. “I thought I was doing pretty well in my restaurant life, but it turns out that I was ignoring a lot of much better opportunities that were open to me,” said Seamons. “Leaving when I did turned out to be exactly the right move.”Today, Seamons works as a corporate sales trainer for a home remodeling company in Portland, Oregon, leaving behind more than a decade of experience as a sommelier in some of New York’s top restaurants including the Standard Grill and Carbone.The skills he garnered selling extravagant vintage Burgundies and single-batch bourbons have transferred to his new career convincing homeowners to undertake major renovation projects. “Sales is all about reading people,” said Seamons. “There’s a similar dynamic to restaurants. Whether you’re giving people the specials or a two-hour presentation on remodeling your home, if you’re good at it, you can sense where you’re connecting and where you’re not.”He expected to take a massive pay cut when he first made the move, but remunerative commissions raised his earning potential beyond anything he could have made in his sommelier job. “I’m in Portland, where the cost of living is much lower, and I’m making twice as much money now as I did in my last restaurant job,” said Seamons.View image in fullscreenSince Keira Baker lost her line-cook job in New York City, she’s worked as a substitute teacher and a ski-lift operator. Though she’s now a head chef at an Oahu, Hawaii, eatery, gigs in other industries made her realize how particularly punishing restaurant work is.Photograph: Jeff FierbergKeira Baker also left New York City when she was laid off as a line cook. Since then, she’s lived in four states in five years (including Hawaii where she currently resides); hiked all 2,198 miles of the Appalachian Trail; and worked in at least five different jobs from ski-lift operator to substitute teacher. The experience of working in other industries brought into focus how she had become conditioned to accept the dysfunctional work environment in many professional kitchens.“Working in the industry made me a worse person,” said Baker. “I was angry all the time. Nothing was ever enough.” Post-Covid, she noticed that she wasn’t encountering the same aggression and intimidation in other workplaces that she had become so accustomed to cooking in professional kitchens. “After the pandemic, I think I realized what life could be like,” she says. “I didn’t want to deal with all the things about the industry that frustrated me anymore: the belittling, the work hours, always having to be perfect. Most jobs are not like this.”Blessings in disguiseAfter the culture shock of adapting to more structured work environments has subsided, most of the restaurant workers I spoke to feel very little nostalgia for their restaurant careers. A few still miss the adrenaline rush of a busy Saturday night, but they don’t miss the anxiety that accompanies it.“When I do go out for drinks or dinner, it’s more fulfilling now,” said Goodhew. “When you work in the industry, you can be overly judgmental about the service and food. I’m not in ‘restaurant manager-mode’ all the time anymore.”Restaurant workers face hard decisions after Hurricane Helene: stay or leave?Read moreWilliams was just elected union steward at his local USPS station. He’s found solace in working toward more secure future for himself, one that might be conducive to realizing the dream of owning his own bar someday. “I don’t miss drunk people yelling at me,” he said. “I’m not being physically threatened, and I don’t have to worry about someone being passed out in the bathroom and having to make sure they’re OK.”After applying unsuccessfully for a job as a corrections officer, Baker recently returned to restaurants as the head chef of a brewpub in Oahu, where her parents have a home. She doesn’t consider the move long-term but hopes it might help provide some closure, a scenario she says is akin to going through a five-year breakup. “I feel like I’ve come to the end of my journey,” she said, “where now if I get out of the industry forever, at least I can say I became a head chef”.Seamons’s new daytime schedule affords him more quality time with his two children, ages two and five. “I wake up now when I used to get home from closing the restaurant,” he says – referring to his new 4 am weekday morning start time. Like many others who left the industry, Seamons reflects on his restaurant past with a mix of reverie and contempt. “I don’t really see myself going back to restaurants,” he added, pausing for a moment to consider the finality of his statement. “I don’t miss the job. I miss the wine.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsOur unequal earthCoronavirusRestaurantsFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You don’t matter’: what Trump’s war on DEI means for every American who’s not a straight white manThe US government’s move to abolish diversity, equity and inclusion policies is a naked attempt to appeal to prejudice – but it may well backfireArwa MahdawiThu 13 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 13 Mar 2025 07.46 EDTShareAlmost a decade ago,I started a business called Rent-A-Minority, which enabled companies to hire a minority ethnic person whenever they needed an injection of diversity to boost their image. I had a variety of inclusivity-enriching hires available, including an “ethnically ambiguous” category and a selection of smiling Muslim women (guaranteed not to support Islamic State or your money back).Like every good startup, Rent-A-Minority posted testimonials from clients and influencers on its website. I made up all the blurbs, because that is the Silicon Valley way:fake it till you make it. One of those fake comments was from Donald Trump, who was still considered a long shot for the presidency in January 2016, when my business launched. “When I’m president, I’ll shut this site down,”Trump’s blurb read.My business, just in case you are reeling in horror,was a joke. I launched it to satirise the superficial and patronising way in which many companies were approaching diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Not to toot my gay Palestinian horn, but the website went viral. Ironically, it briefly got one minority ethnic person (me) a lot of business speaking to companies around the world about how to approach diversity in a more meaningful manner.Rent-A-Minority may have been a joke, but that fake Trump testimonial seems to have been a prophecy. Trump’s second term has become a crusade against DEI. Hours into his presidency, hesigned two executive orderstargeting “radical and wasteful” DEI programmes. If a federal initiative has anything remotely to do with the issue, Trump has decreed that it must be eliminated. References tothe Enola Gayaircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan, for example, were marked for deletion by the Department of Defense. Why? Because the aircraft’s name has the word “gay” in it.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump was quick to suggest, without evidence, that the deadly mid-air collision over Washington DC in January could have been the result of diversity hiring.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesDEI has been turned into a scapegoat. When a passenger jet and a US army helicoptercrashed over Washington DCin January, killing 67 people, one of the first things Trump said was that the collision could have beenthe result of diversity hiring. This has been a favourite talking point of the right for a while – in January 2024, Elon Musk spluttered on X about how the aviation industry had “prioritized DEI hiring over safety” – but it has gone from the fringe of politics to the frontline.Now that the political landscape has changed, many companies that used to talk the big talk about inclusivity have changed their tune. Some, such as Costco and Apple, have defended their diversity policies and chosen tostay the course. But roughly 20% of companies in theS&P 100–including Meta, Amazon, Target and McDonald’s– have retreated from DEI commitments since Trump’s re-election, according to aBloomberg News analysis.To understand where we are today in the US, we have to look at where we have been. DEI may be a relatively new term, but the idea has roots in the civil rights movement of the 50s and 60s. TheCivil Rights Act of 1964made it illegal for most employers with 25 or more staff (reduced to 15 or more by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972) to discriminate on the basis of race, colour, religion, sex and national origin. At the same time, affirmative action policies emerged to try to redress the historical under-representation of racial minorities and women.There is one group in workplaces where over 90% believe they are working in meritocracies – and that’s white menJoan WilliamsThat under-representation was immense: in 1966, African Americans comprised about 11% of the US population yet heldfewer than 1%of all “officials and managers” roles (the most senior category defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which captured the data). By 2013, that had risen to 6.8%. As for women, they made up 9.4% of officials and managers in 1966,rising to 38.6% in 2013.While DEI has its roots in addressing injustices, there is a strong business case for it. According toresearch by McKinsey, companies with a representation of women exceeding 30% (which puts them in the top quartile) are significantly more likely to perform well financially than those with 30% or fewer. Companies in McKinsey’s top quartile for ethnic diversity show an average “financial advantage” of 27% over others.Joan Williams, a law professor and the founding director of the Equality Action Center at UC Law San Francisco, has done data‑based research that shows that, when approached properly, DEI initiatives result in more effective organisations. And “properly” doesn’t mean forcing employees to sit through one-off training sessions on unconscious bias, Williams stresses; it means introducing structural tweaks that remove bias in hiring and performance reviews, such as “keeping track of who’s rejected based on lack of ‘culture fit’ and looking for demographic patterns”. In other words, when you create an environment where all talent – regardless of what they look like or where they come from – can rise to the top, rather than just the people whose faces and backgrounds “fit”, you are more likely to get something approaching meritocracy.View image in fullscreen‘Heterosexual, non-disabled, cisgendered white men and women have always had validation in the workplace’ … DEI practitioner Akilah Cadet.Photograph: Jon Kopaloff/Variety/Getty Images“We all want a meritocracy, but too often we don’t have them,” Williams says. “There is one group in professional workplaces where over 90% believe they are working in meritocracies – and that’s white men. Every other group has sharply less confidence that they are working in meritocracies because they feel that they are being held to a different standard.” And those people tend to be correct. “We did 22 DEI experiments inside companies,” says Williams. “One company was horrified to find that they were hiring white men who had lower ratings than women and people of colour who weren’t hired.”In short, DEI should always have been treated as a serious business issue. Instead, it has often been approached as a box-ticking exercise or a PR manoeuvre. Never was that truer than afterthe murder of George Floydin 2020: as racial justice demonstrations erupted around the world, corporations suddenly started shouting about DEI from the rooftops. Listings for roles in DEIincreased by 55%in the two months after Floyd’s death, according to the recruitment website Glassdoor.“The amount of money I made starting May 2020 until about 2023 – I’ve never made so much money in my entire life,” says Akilah Cadet, a DEI practitioner and the author ofWhite Supremacy Is All Around. Some of that money came from brands who genuinely seemed to care, she says, but others were just in it to look good. Now, however, the jobs have dried up. “I’ve laid off my staff. I have a much smaller team. I’m being punished as a result of people no longer wanting to care about people they should have been caring about in the first place,” Cadet says.She is not the only one feeling punished. “Imagine that you were working for a company where you had tools in place, access to an executive coach, a programme that got you into a leadership track,” Cadet says. “These individuals had support and were told they were valued. Heterosexual, non-disabled, cisgendered white men and women have always had that [validation] in the workplace. And it will still be there after the attack on DEI, but it won’t be for people who don’t identify as those groups.“That’s the bigger unfortunate thing that’s happening here: ‘You mattered – and guess what? I’m going to remind you that you don’t matter again.’”View image in fullscreenListings for DEI roles rose 55% after George Floyd’s murder.Photograph: Julio Cortez/APThe Trump administration’s crusade seems to be less about effectiveness and more about reminding certain people that they don’t matter. “It is not about diversity, equity and inclusion,” says Vernā Myers, a DEI pioneer who was the vice-president of inclusion strategy at Netflix until September 2023. “This is a takedown of structures that have been put together for over 30, 40 years to really get us to be the America that we say we are.”The Washington Post’s Karen Attiah shares that sentiment. “Let’s call this what it really is: resegregation,” she wrotein a column last month. “I mean it in the sense that a Black woman would never even be considered for a federal job or a management position at a big company – the way it was in, say, the 1960s. It is not ‘inclusion’ the Republicans want to get rid of, it’s integration.”Trump’s purge of DEI sympathisers within federal ranks has already affected some high-ranking people of colour. In late February, Trumpabruptly firedthe US air force general CQ Brown Jr as chair of the joint chiefs of staff. Pete Hegseth, the former Fox News host who is now the defence secretary, had previously questioned whether Brown had been made chair because he was Black. “Was it because of his skin colour? Or his skill? We’ll never know, but always doubt – which on its face seems unfair to CQ. But since he has made the race card one of his biggest calling cards, it doesn’t really much matter,” wrote Hegseth in one of his books.View image in fullscreenKaren Attiah wrote in the Washington Post that Trump’s policy was an attempt at ‘resegregation’.Photograph: Arturo Holmes/Getty ImagesOther Trump staffers have been even more blunt. “Competent white men must be in charge if you want things to work,” wroteDarren Beattie, who now has a senior job in thestate department, on X in October. “Unfortunately, our entire national ideology is predicated on coddling the feelings of women and minorities, and demoralizing competent white men.” The implication seems to be that white men should be automatically considered competent until proved otherwise; everyone else should be seen as a “diversity hire”.Heather Mac Donald, a fellow of the right-leaning thinktank the Manhattan Institute and the author of the book The Diversity Delusion, makes a similar argument. “If you know that every institution is practising race and gender preferences, you have no confidence that, if you’re in an emergency room and a Black doctor walks through the door, that doctor has been hired on the basis of merit and not race,” she says.But what about white men? Wouldn’t it be ignorant to assume that every white man in a position of prominence was chosen solely on the basis of his qualifications and not, say, because he played golf with the right people or his face “fitted”? “Today, to be a white male is to be at the bottom of the hiring pool,” Mac Donald says. “You have to be twice, three times as good to be considered as a white male. The main elite institutions have made absolute preference for anybody other than heterosexual white males.”The idea that being white or male puts you at a disadvantage in the recruitment process isnot reflected in reality, says Williams. “We have over 10 years of data, including very recent data that shows that, in professional workplaces, white men report wildly less bias and wildly more fairness,” she says. “There are some white men who are really hurting, but those are non-elite white men. The economic and cultural position of elite white men is still pretty peachy.”White men still occupy most of the top-level roles in US companies. According toa 2023 study, “ethnically and racially diverse executives hold just 12.5% of CEO, CFO and COO positions in Fortune 500 and S&P 500 companies … while women occupy 13.7% of the seats”.Plenty of studies showthat white-sounding names get called back for jobs more than Black‑sounding ones.View image in fullscreenPete Hegseth, the defence secretary, has questioned whether CQ Brown Jr – whom Trump sacked abruptly last month – was made chair of the joint chiefs of staff because he was Black.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersNo matter what the data says, however, there is still a sense among a lot of white men that women, LGBTQ+ people and racial minorities are suddenly the ones getting every advantage in life while they are being discriminated against. The podcast hostScott Galloway, who is very far from a rabid rightwinger, has argued that anti-discrimination laws exist already and there isno need for DEI: “Corporations and universities are now advantaging 76% of the populace [minority groups and women in the US] – and when you’re advantaging 76% of the populace, you’re not advantaging anybody.”Galloway is right that some DEI interventions haven’t benefited anyone:numerous studiesshow that the most common programmes, including mandatory diversity training, increase resentment in the workplace.“Too often in the past, DEI language used highly technical ‘social justice warrior’ language and you had scolding training without much guidance,” Williams says. “A lot of people found it irritating.” This isn’t to say that we should just tear up DEI altogether, however. We have an opportunity to remake it in a more meaningful and effective manner. We are at an inflection point, but it doesn’t have to be a regressive one, says Williams: “The hope is – and there’s some evidence of this – that the attack on DEI will cause people to actually focus on the evidence and making structural changes that make sure people are treated consistently.”Myers is also optimistic. “We’ve made so many inroads that it will be very hard, especially in the young generation, to convince them that somehow a whitewashed version of talent is a place where they want to be,” she says. “The reason that I’m optimistic is because I believe that humanity is always evolving. We will always move forward. Will there be obstacles and retrenchment? Yes. But I think we’re better positioned than we ever have been to resist.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpInequalityRaceTrump administrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Much of the country, along with the rest of the world, has moved on from the pandemic, with fewer people wearing masks and life returning to the way it was before the outbreak started.Among the dozens of people who shared with the Guardian how their lives have changed since, many talked about embracing remote working and the greater work-life balance they have achieved. Others mentioned feeling encouraged to change jobs or start their own business, as well as how their relationships were strengthened by the shared experience.‘I don’t feel part of society’: how Covid is still taking its toll five years onRead moreMany reported being diagnosed with long Covid and the permanent impact this had had on them. Some still said they experience loneliness and find it difficult to socialise, while others feel trust between people has eroded and that differing views highlighted by the pandemic has made society more divisive.Here, six people in the US tell us how their lives have changed since the start of the Covid outbreak.‘It’s like everyone is moving on without us’In February 2020 I was living a vibrant, full life. I hiked, backpacked and rock climbed. I had a strong community. I was planning to go to med school. Lockdown was hard but we were all in it together.Then, in 2022, I got Covid despite taking extreme precautions. Now, I am bed-bound with long Covid while everyone thinks the pandemic is over. My partner and I are so lonely, seeing everyone believe Covid is over and moving on without us.I used to be whip-smart and witty, and now I labor to process basic sentences. I used to be a risk-taker and spontaneous, and now I have to plan out my walks to the bathroom. I used to love six-hour talks with friends; now I can barely handle a short phone call. I had traveled to 20 countries and 30 states; now I leave the house once or twice a year for medical appointments.I lie in bed and think of how my life used to be. I miss the sky. I miss my old life so much it’s unbearable. I feel like a ghost. Some days, I feel everything is behind me except suffering and oppression. Others, I am able to listen to a good book and text a friend, and I feel hopeful I could improve someday, though most likely never recover.Nash, 25, unemployed, Washington DC‘I harvested dead trees and left behind tables and benches’View image in fullscreenThomas Locatell.Photograph: Thomas Locatell/Guardian CommunityIn March 2020, I began frequenting Gilbrook nature area, a local woodland I had become fond of near my apartment. As a carpenter, my love of all things tree-related had caused me to notice the unusual nature of this little patch of woods.Every day I would walk there and wonder why more people weren’t doing the same. That’s when the gravity of the situation of the pandemic really sank in. People were scared. I wasn’t. That was freeing.With a few hand tools and a wagon, my trips became not walks in a lovely park, but a mission to harvest dead trees on the ground. Once I made my first cut, I was hooked.I hardly missed a day up there for over a year and left behind tables and benches – one of my largest pieces was a 16ft table. I even replaced a rotten set of steps down to a pond where beavers lived. It was an experience like no other.View image in fullscreenThomas’s workshop and some of the pieces he has worked on.Photograph: Thomas Locatell/Guardian CommunityPeople started to notice and I was on the local news and featured in a YouTube video about different characters in Vermont. The city became aware of my activity and actually approved of it. To my great surprise, they provided me with a place to work where I am engaged to this day. Five years on, I never expected for any of this to come out of the pandemic – it’s been fun.Thomas Locatell, 67, retired carpenter, Winooski,Vermont‘We’ve become closer as a family’Prior to the pandemic, I had a good relationship with my parents overall. My father’s chronic condition started accelerating and I think it brought my mother and I closer together. When the pandemic started getting serious, I started talking to talk to my sister more often and I think that brought us closer to one another.Just before the pandemic, my father was in a memory-care facility for his advanced dementia so when the world shut down my mother called me in a panic. She was living alone for the first time ever, so I took control and made a point of making sure that I sounded confident and knowledgable for her sake. Being panicky or diffident in that situation serves no one.Looking back, I think the pandemic gave us all a lesson in patience, grace and compassion, and I think our reactions to the pandemic showed all of us who we really are.Now that my father’s passed away, I’ve become the de facto head of my family. I think that role would have happened eventually but that the pandemic accelerated that. I’ve taken a more parental role with my 80-year-old mother; not that she isn’t capable, but being my father’s caretaker took a lot out of her. The three of us are still close and supportive of each other, but most of all we’ve learnt to be more honest with one another.David, 54, engineer, Washington DC‘We have spent thousands on masks, PCR testing and Hepa filters’As someone with a previous traumatic brain injury and a heart arrhythmia, I am at high risk of catching Covid. It’s an ever-present threat and one I am forced to navigate on a daily basis.Five years on, being Covid conscious is my reality now and the precautions I take in order to avoid infection are exhaustive. Both my wife and I wear N95 respirators every time we leave the house. We never eat in restaurants, or meet with friends and family for drinks or anything that potentially exposes us to sick people. Holidays are now impossible to enjoy because we cannot remove our masks. We have spent thousands on masks, home PCR testing equipment and Hepa filters. Every interaction in public is a calculation of risk versus reward.It’s isolating, sad and exhausting that we still must live this way to protect ourselves while the rest of the world has moved on. I’ve grown apart from my family as our values have diverged considerably, and I no longer trust people to be considerate of others. What’s worse is the denial of Covid while it continues to go on. It makes me feel crazy at times for keeping up with the precautions I do. It’s as if the word Covid has become a taboo to speak about.The one good thing to come out of the pandemic is that both of us have worked remotely at different jobs since 2020. This has allowed us to alter our lifestyles to be more aligned with our values and it’s been exceptionally liberating.Austin, 31, graphic designer, Austin,Iowa‘It feels as though we have ignored the lessons of yesterday’View image in fullscreenNicholas from New York.Photograph: Nicholas/Guardian CommunityI have worked in public health for 10 years now, most of that time spent in applied infectious disease control. While I was finishing my graduate degree I read an email about some “undiagnosed pneumonia” in a Chinese city. I still remember the goosebumps flittering up and down my arms. We had always been taught about “Disease X” and that another pandemic would eventually happen, but here it was.Studying pandemics in textbooks and through academic journals pales in comparison to living and working through one. I remember receiving calls from friends and family asking about what to do, how to respond, questions about anything from masking to vaccines. I learned to take responsibility for each word I gave in answer.At the same time, I remember the sense of pride I felt that I was able to go into work each day and help people. I remember the joy at hearing about the results of the vaccine trials and the excitement I felt standing in line at the hospital to receive my first dose.Being adjacent to such suffering has taken a toll on me that I have yet to fully process. If I have changed as a person, it is perhaps that I feel more cynical. How could so many people die, and yet so many more be so unmoved by such tragedy? It feels as though we have ignored the lessons of yesterday at our own peril.My anger at the injustice around me has driven me to consider political work and to continue my path towards practicing medicine. There is always work to be done, there is always responsibility to be taken, and I want to be involved.Nicholas, 29, works in public health, New YorkFive years on from the pandemic, how has Covid changed our world? | The panelRead more‘I doubt I would have quit my old job without the pandemic’I used to work for a prominent university and was the associate director of a research institute. My life was very stable and I thought I would be in the same job until retirement.During the first year of the pandemic, I felt like we were all in this together. I found the second year harder and didn’t feel like the students or institutions were as supportive as before.After teaching every semester during the pandemic, organizing two summers of remote internships, and trying to keep my student advisees on track, I was burned out and took a one-year sabbatical from teaching and administration in 2022.Discouraged by the resistance from higher-ups to giving me this break, I started looking for alternative jobs. I’ve now been working remotely at my new employer for 18 months and have a much better work-life balance. It’s more challenging but I doubt I would have quit my old job without the pandemic push.Sonya, 50s, research scientist, USExplore more on these topicsUS newsCoronavirusHealthInfectious diseasesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I have no idea how they lived up there, how they got there.”The chance find of a logbook by De Groot’s father, Mense de Groot, an administrator who from 1942 lived in the Mauritshuis museum with his wife and children, including Menno, inspired researchers to examine the museum’s history.“People were hiding in November 1944 because of theArbeitseinsatz,but hiding in the Mauritshuis was hiding in plain sight,” Quentin Buvelot, a researcher and curator, said. “It was a house in the storm.”View image in fullscreenWilhelm Martin, the director of the Mauritshuis museum, quietly resisted by removing artworks from the museum during the Nazi occupation.Photograph: rkd/MauritshuisArt from the museum, including Johannes Vermeer’sGirl With a Pearl Earring, was first hidden in a bomb-proof bunker underneath the building and later stored in locations around the Netherlands. The German-born museum director Wilhelm Martin played a careful role, allowing the Nazis five propaganda exhibitions while also quietly resisting.A newly discovered note on Martin’s retirement in 1953 revealed he was involved in supporting people who had gone undercover on Assendelftstraat and in the museum. “Martin doesn’t say how many, but he says that on a daily basis, 36 loaves of bread were delivered … And we also found [an expenses claim] for a first-class carriage to Maastricht, where he went with the Girl With a Pearl Earring under his arm on 11 May 1942,” said Buvelot.Secret concerts were also held in the museum’s basement between 1942 and 1944, according to Frank van Vree, an author and researcher at the NIOD institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies. “They were held to support musicians who were cornered by their resistance to German measures, especially compulsory membership of the Nazi Kultuurkamer,” he said. “People who refused to become members were out of work.”Mense de Groot, who was hired to work at the museum when the janitor retired, also worked for the resistance. “He usually got Trouw, an underground newspaper,” Menno de Groot says in the exhibition. “And my dad, he copied them, made more copies. ‘Menno, are you ready? I’ve got 25 here.’ I folded them up small, then I put them under my shirt and went to where people were living and distributed them.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photography and video by María Magdalena ArréllagaThu 13 Mar 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 13 Mar 2025 13.23 EDTShareJosé Iquebi was hunting wild pigs in the forest when he was kidnapped at gunpoint by men on horseback. They lassoed him, locked him in a cage, and transported him hundreds of miles downriver toParaguay’s capital, Asunción. His captors charged people money to stare and take photographs. He was about 12 years old.“They treated us like animals,” recalls Iquebi, now 84. It would be decades before he saw his nomadic Ayoreo community again.The colonisation of Paraguay’s portion of theChaco– a sprawling South American outback of gnarled hardwoods, arid grasslands and brackish swamps – had just begun in earnest.In 1926, the firstMennonitesarrived: a group of ultra-traditional Protestants from the Soviet Union and Canada. Paraguay promised them virgin territory and freedom from persecution.View image in fullscreenA copy of an undated picture showing a group of the first Mennonite immigrants posing with a group of Indigenous people.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesThe German-speaking settlers sent missionaries to catch and convert hunter-gatherers like the Ayoreo who already called the Chaco home. Untold numbers ofIndigenous people died from disease. The survivors were given jobs clearing the undergrowth and herding cattle, while the Mennonites razed a country-sized swathe of forest and became wealthy from ranching.Today, a few small bands of uncontacted Ayoreo –estimated to number roughly 150 people– still hold out in the remaining patchwork of green. They are one of the world’s last cultures living in voluntary isolation outside the Amazon. But representatives from a dozen Indigenous communities and organisations say a fresh wave ofdeforestation poses an “imminent risk”to their forest-dwelling relatives.Locator map of Paraguay, Faro Moro ranch and the Dos de Enero Indigenous communityAn “extraordinary” – and fiercely disputed – flurry of traces of uncontacted Ayoreowere reported throughout 2023 and 2024around a vast cattle ranch called Faro Moro. Until recently, the property encompassed 40,000 hectares (99,000 acres) of intact forest. The ranch served asa sanctuary for endangered jaguars.View image in fullscreenJosé Iquebi sits in front of his home in an Ayoreo villageSome Ayoreo recall stories of family members returning to the forest at Faro Moro after the trauma of contact. Iquebi remembers it as Tamucode, a place with plentiful game and abundant streams. “There’s water there, even during drought,” says Guei Basui Picanerai, 43, the leader of Ebetogue village. “That’s why we think our isolated brothers still live there.”But since early 2023, satellite imagery indicates at least 13,000 hectares (32,000 acres) of vegetation at Faro Moro have been bulldozed and replaced with pasture for cattle.Community leaders say the accelerating destruction ispiling pressure on their isolated relatives, forcing them out of their territory. Nowadays, they fear, white people will treat any uncontacted Ayoreo not as a curiosity, but an inconvenience to be quietly disposed of.“The cattle ranchers only think about money. When they see an isolated Indigenous person, they know their business will be put at risk,” says Iquebi.Satellite view of new pasture areas around Faro Moro ranchSatellite view of new pasture areas around Faro Moro ranch.Carlos Diri Etacore, 56, props a corroded shotgun over one shoulder and follows a trail along the perimeter of Faro Moro, slipping between towering cacti, thorn bushes and a wire fence. The leader of Ijnapui – an Ayoreo village of dust-blown wooden shacks – was also born in the forest, and can read it like a book.As a neighbour widens the path with a machete, Etacore studies a shredded branch. “We’re looking for some kind of sign,” Etacore says. “Because many people deny the information we put out, and the sightings.” Community patrols like this have helpedIniciativa Amotocodie, a Paraguayan nonprofit, register dozens of clues to the existence of uncontacted Ayoreo at Faro Moro.View image in fullscreenVegetation near the Faro Moro ranch. Campaigners say the ranch is the central link in a migration corridor between an Ayoreo reserve, and the dense forest along the Bolivian borderExperienced Ayoreo trackers say they have seen and heard clearcut evidence: an axehole in a tree for extracting honey; tribal marks cut into bark; a discarded wasps’ nest, whose larvae settled Ayoreo no longer eat; whistles and singing issuing from the trees; salt taken from a village, where a stone tool and harvested plants were left behind.Some report finding prints beside their vegetable plots: whether those made by the tell-tale splayed toes of the forest Ayoreo, or their sandals made of rectangular strips of wood, tapir hide, or salvaged vehicle tires.Mirian Posoroja, 30, the primary school teacher in the Dos de Enero community, says she glimpsed a half-naked figure with a child on the edge of the dirt road that runs past the ranch. “Suddenly, they disappeared,” recalled Posoroja. “I think they saw me and returned to the forest.”View image in fullscreenAyoreo community leader Carlos Diri Etacore examines animal footprints in an area near the forest reserve where the Ayoreo believe their uncontacted relatives areIniciativa Amotocodie has also logged a handful of reported sightings. In testimony shared by the NGO, two Ayoreo villagers say the son of a Faro Moro foreman approached them in a store and told them that workers on the ranch had seen two uncontacted people running away while they were felling a section of forest. He also reportedly told them workers had discovered – and destroyed – what seemed to be an Ayoreo shelter made of branches. An Ayoreo student subsequently claimed to have seen a photograph of the shelter on the mobile phone of his classmate, the son of another Faro Moro employee. However, the Guardian was unable to verify this account.Others say that intruders – possibly isolated Ayoreo searching for food and metal tools – have crept into their villages at dawn, causing their dogs to bark incessantly. But they know contact could be lethal for both groups.A red sky over a large expanse of fields.A view though smoke-filled air across grazing land on the Faro Moro property during wildfires in August 2024Though highly vulnerable to outsiders’ illnesses, the forest-dwellers are fierce warriors. “Because we wear clothes, they consider us white people,” Picanerai says. “They won’t recognise that we are the same blood, and could do us harm.”A contract from December 2022, seen by the Guardian, indicated the ranch was then owned by Faro Moro Limited,a company registered in the Isle of Man, a British Crown Dependency. Its directors arePeter Kaindl, an Austrian lumber baron, and Danish citizen Henrik Buchleitner.A request for comment was made via another company owned by Kaindl. Buchleitner could not be reached for comment.The contract andthe environmental impact assessmentindicated that a Paraguayan company, Hekopora SA, has rented the ranch from Faro Moro Limited and received environmental permits to raze more than half the property’s forested area for ranching.View image in fullscreenGuei Basui Picanerai, 43, leader of the Ayoreo village of EbetogueAndrés Cramer, Hekopora’s vice-president, denies any evidence of uncontacted Ayoreo living at Faro Moro, and defends the deforestation as fully compliant with Paraguayan law. The ranch “has been constantly monitored for the last 35 years,” he says. “At no moment have people, footprints, remains of campfires, [or] signs of human occupation been identified.”He said any sighting of uncontacted people within Faro Moro “would be considered extraordinary and exceptional, and without doubt would have been reported to management and spread throughout the whole region”.Citing client confidentiality, Cramer declined to confirm who owns Faro Moro. But he revealed that leadership positions within Hekopora are occupied by AgrInvest, an agricultural investment and management firm with offices in Hamburg, Germany and a portfolio of 13 ranches across Paraguay, adding to growing concerns overrich nations exporting biodiversity loss.Dr Jeffrey Thompson, who studies jaguars and their prey with Conacyt, Paraguay’s national scientific council, sayshe conducted research at Faro Moro for several years starting in 2017, including operating more than 200 camera traps for four months. He lamented the large-scale licensed deforestation “from the perspective of habitat loss”.But Thompson says he had seen no evidence of isolated groups, and that neither the ranch’s then-owner, employees, nor neighbouring communities had mentioned them. “I don’t think there are uncontacted Indigenous people there,” he says.Yet according to Iniciativa Amotocodie, Faro Moro is the central link in amigration corridorbetween thePNCAT, an Ayoreo reserve, and the dense forest along the border with Bolivia. If this fragile chain of tree cover is broken, Ayoreo groups that range widely in search of sustenance could perish, or be forced to leave the forest, says the NGO.We’re still in the era of feudalism, where the lord does what he wants with his property and whatever’s in itMarilina Marichal, lawyerThose that survive this process – the most recent contact was in 2004 – are “always kept on the margins” of modern society, left dependent on Mennonite, Paraguayan and Brazilian landlords for work, says Miguel Alarcón, the NGO’s coordinator. “So much is lost,” he adds. “It’s the annihilation of a culture and a way of life.”In February, the International Working Group on Indigenous Peoples Living in Voluntary Isolation (GTI-PIACI), a coalition of native organisations from across South America, warned that uncontacted Ayoreo at Faro Moroface an “alarming risk of contact and genocide”.Last May, Ayoreo communities went before a judge in the Mennonite colony of Filadelfia, about 80km (50 miles) south, in search of an urgent court order to halt the deforestation. The court ruled against them. Appeals have since been rejected. They are now preparing to take the case before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, says Marilina Marichal, a lawyer representing the Ayoreo.International treaties legally bind Paraguay – and its own constitution – to protectIndigenous peoples, she argues. But in practice, “we’re still in the era of feudalism, where the lord does what he wants with his property and whatever’s in it”.The threats to the Ayoreo and their forest home are mounting. TheBioceanic Corridor, a new highway for agribusiness bisecting the Chaco, due to be completed in 2026, will ramp up road traffic and ranching activity – anddeepen penetration by drug cartels.Mining firms are searching for lithium, the mineral crucial for smartphones, datacentres and electric vehicles, also linked todepletion of ecosystems in neighbouring Argentina, Bolivia and Chile.Years of drought –worsened by the climate crisis– have left the Chaco’s vegetation prone to raging wildfires. One such blaze, started on deforested ranch land in September,scorched 200,000 hectares (495,000 acres) of Ayoreo territory.Yet Paraguay’s farming groups and many Mennonites dispute the scientificconsensus on human-made global heating. They also defend the cattle industry as bringing growth to an isolated region of one of South America’s poorest countries. Top destinations for Paraguayan beef – witha record 22 million cattle slaughtered in 2024– include Chile, Taiwan, Brazil, Israel, the US and Russia.View image in fullscreenWerner Schroeder, regional president of Paraguay’s ranching lobby groupThe Paraguayan Rural Association claims that reports of uncontacted people at Faro Moroare part of a plot. Werner Schroeder, 57, a Mennonite lawyer and the ranching lobby group’s regional president, assisted Faro Moro’s defence in the lawsuit. He has never visited the property, but he thinks it is “99.9% impossible” that uncontacted Ayoreo live there.“There should exist some trace,” says Schroeder. “They haven’t even shown us a photo.” He claims that witnesses who testified before the court that they had seen “wild people” had imagined it, or been coached.“Who is behind this?” he asks. “Why do they want to put a brake on development?”He complains that ranchers’ margins are being squeezed by Europe’s “extremist” environmental standards and punishing drought, although he maintains that humans contribute “little or nothing” to global heating.Two-thirds ofParaguay’s native population lives in poverty, three times the national average. Schroeder argues that they enjoy “excessive” privileges, suggesting they should have to choose between Indigenous status and the right to vote. “The Indigenous are our neighbours, and we’ll have to live with them,” he concedes. “They need us.”View image in fullscreenWomen and children of the Ijnapui Ayoreo communityBut if the gulf between the native majority and the Mennonites widens further, he predicts, “tomorrow they will kidnap us, or do us harm,” adding “we’re going to have to build prisons if we can’t create jobs.”Other Mennonites agree that the Chaco is at a crisis point but differ profoundly on the way forward. Riky Unger, 53, is the high school principal in the colony of Neuland.The tall biologist and theologian in a tweed jacket and jeans is unpopular with his peers for several reasons: he’s divorced, believes in human-made climate change, encourages his students to question their elders and recently awarded a scholarship to an Indigenous Nivaclé girl.Unger is also scathing about Mennonite claims to have brought Christian values such as humility and respect for God’s creation to the Chaco. His people, he argues, “are extremely hard working, they’re well-organised, but they’re also hypocrites”.View image in fullscreenRiky Unger, principal of Neuland high school, at his farm in Neuland Mennonite colonyHunting down and forcibly evangelising the Chaco’s pre-existing cultures “was the greatest error we ever made,” he continues. “We complain that the natives don’t want to work and can’t support themselves. But what did we do? We took their identity away.”He warns that the amassing of wealth and power by a few families risks triggering internal splits and draws the hatred of other Paraguayans, factors that forced the Mennonites to flee multiple historical homelands. “We always make the same mistake,” he says.Unger says a century after the Mennonites arrived, they urgently needed to preserve what was left of the Chaco and reach a new understanding with those who were there first. “The first step,” he says, “is to ask for their forgiveness and admit that we’ve done wrong.”View image in fullscreenBoys play football in an Ayoreo village in the Paraguayan Chaco, 2024Iquebi, the formerly enslaved Ayoreo elder, thinks the reckoning should extend more widely. “The Paraguayan government doesn’t protect the lives of Indigenous people in general, much less the Ayoreo,” he argues. “They should send an official, an authority, to see our needs and concerns.”The government’s Indigenous instituteandthe environment ministrywere contacted for comment.If deforestation continues, and the forced contacts that marked his childhood are repeated, Iquebi warns: “that will be the end of the Ayoreo.”Explore more on these topicsIndigenous peoplesUncontacted peopleParaguayAmericasCattleFarmingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fagan was episodically homeless in his youth, sleeping in his car and camping outside while he attended college and later in doorways abroad as a traveling musician.Over the course of his career, he has kept a relentless focus on what really matters: the people living outside. Now in a new book,The Lost and the Found, Fagan argues powerfully that the “atrociously unforgivable” poverty in the US continues to stymie efforts to alleviate the situation. He dives deeply into human stories, exploring the paths of two people who wound up living on the streets of San Francisco:Rita Grant, a mother of five from Florida, andTyson Feilzer, a charismatic young man who grew up in an affluent Bay Area community. Both reconnected with loved ones who found them through Fagan’s stories in the Chronicle, and Fagan tells of lives ravaged by homelessness and addiction and their families’ tireless efforts to help.The Guardian spoke with Fagan about homelessness and what has changed in the decades he has been reporting on the issue, and why there is still reason to be hopeful.This interview has been edited for length and clarity.You’ve been covering homelessness for many years. How have you watched this crisis change in that time?It just got more calcified. I started as a paid daily newspaper reporter the year Ronald Reagan got elected. I watched homelessness explode through the 80s. The root of it all, it seemed clear to me, was the decimation of social aid programs under Reaganomics. And in the late 70s and early 80s when mental institutions were pulled down through an effort by both the left and the right. Liberals thought that it was compassionate to close institutions – which had problems – and put patients into board-and-care homes. The right thought “we can save a lot of money”. The trouble was government didn’t follow up adequately with funding, so we wound up with a lot of mentally ill people in the streets.View image in fullscreenA tent outside Best Buy in San Francisco, on 18 January 2016.Photograph: David Levene/GuardianThrough the 90s, the country discovered supportive housing was a terrific fix for the most severely troubled people. You bring them inside and then deal with the problems that put them out in the street to begin with. As the years have gone by, there’s been a lot of effort put into supportive housing, but it’s expensive.The problem that has consistently stood out for me as a reporter for the last 45 years is poverty. Affordable housing has disappeared in large numbers. My research, which I put in the book, shows that about 30% of the country lives right at or below poverty level, if you take the cost of living for the individual areas and demographics into account. When you have that amount of poverty and people struggling, you’re not going to get rid of homelessness. You need to attack it at the root, but we’re treating it on the other end with Band-Aids for people who’ve been ruined who shouldn’t have been ruined to begin with.In 2003, you spent months on the street documenting homelessness in San Francisco. How do you think that experience would be different today?I don’t think it would be different. The number of homeless people is about the same today as it was then. The main difference is that people use tents. Back in 2003, it was mostly tarps draped over shopping carts and cardboard and shacks. Other than that, you have the same dynamics: poor people who can’t afford a place to live and wound up disabled in one way or another. These are the long-term chronically homeless.We concentrated on the chronically homeless because that’s usually about 30% of any city’s homeless population but it’s the most visible. They are the most desperate and dysfunctional folks. We wanted to figure out what was going to help them. It’s the same fix today as it was then – supportive housing, outreach, counseling, drug rehab, mental rehab, healthcare.Today a lot of us have done stories about the scourge of fentanyl. Fentanyl is horrible, but, frankly, heroin was killing people by the droves in 2003, in the 90s, in the 80s. Fentanyl kills quicker and is more volatile. But you still have a very similar dynamic of desperation and fear and mental trauma and addiction today that you did 20 years ago.What are the most common misconceptions about homelessness?View image in fullscreen‘No one wants to be homeless. People get stuck in their survival modes.’Photograph: Courtesy of One Signal Publishers/Atria BooksA lot of people think people are homeless by choice. It’s not a choice. No one wants to be homeless. People get stuck in their survival modes. They wind up in the street unable to pull themselves off or to find a way off. The most severely troubled become addicted, which then starts this awful cycle. You’re stuck and it becomes scary to think of giving up your survival routine to go into a shelter when you hear bad things about shelters. No one wants to sleep outside. It’s hard, it’s cold, it’s dirty. You put cardboard down to keep yourself from getting too cold. People can come by steal your stuff, beat you up, especially if you’re sleeping alone, which I did a lot of in my young life. That’s no way to be. People want a door that they can lock, and a bed they can sleep in with a roof over their heads.The other thing is most cities believe people are pouring into their city from outside. That is way overblown. Only 30% of homeless people in San Francisco came from outside the city. The rest were housed before they became homeless.In the time that you’ve been reporting on this issue, are there approaches that stand out to you for their ability to really lead to meaningful change?The prime example of that is veteran homelessness. Over the last 10 years, veteran homelessness has been cut in half, at a time when homelessness overall has risen. The reason that worked is the VA [US Department of Veterans Affairs] and HUD [US Department of Housing and Urban Development], those two in particular, teamed up to address chronic veteran homelessness. The advantage was the VA could supply healthcare and in combination with HUD special housing vouchers and those could be used in independent housing or in supportive housing contexts. A lot of housing was created for homeless veterans both as complexes and individually, and healthcare was key to helping them. It showed what can happen if we as a society put enough of the right kind of resources into the problem.Many of the solutions to address homelessness happen at a systems level. What can individual people do to help?Support programs that work. Pay attention. And that’s hard. Most people are working their jobs, taking care of their families. But be an informed citizen. Read stuff like in the Chronicle, in the Guardian, that examines programs in a journalistically objective way, trying to show what works and what doesn’t. On a personal level, it’s really good to volunteer at soup kitchens, food banks. They always need to help because everyone is underfunded.On the most personal level, walking down the street, when you pass by homeless folks, be kind. Stop and talk. With the range of difficulty that a chronically homeless person has, having someone just have a conversation and treat you with dignity and make you feel seen for a few minutes, that’s a gift. That having been said, if you walk by someone shooting up, acting out with a mental episode or dopesick, those kinds of behaviors you’re not gonna wanna stop and talk because a lot of times you’ll be talking to the behavior not the person. Stop and talk to people who are rationally available for a conversation.With the recent supreme court ruling allowing cities to take a more punitive approach to homelessness, and an administration that is seeking major cuts to important programs, where do you think we’re headed?Cutting social services to the bone probably won’t lead to anything productive in terms of alleviating homelessness. I think that could lead to a more punitive approach. We’ll see where the federal government hits. State and local governments are gonna have to react in their own way as resources dwindle. Whatever it is, it’s gonna be tough.A lot of cities have been under a ton of pressure over the last several years, as the street population has become more visible, to erase it. The public goes through these periods of compassion fatigue, and we’re in a heavy one right now. The general feeling is: “OK, just make it go away.” So you see people being swept to the edges of town. In the case of San Francisco, the city doubled the number of shelters, vastly increased the amount of supportive housing, so a good number of people are going into facilities. But there are still people being swept off to other neighborhoods, which is how it’s always been.There is so much about the homelessness crisis that is so heartbreaking. What gives you hope?Stories like Rita’s give me hope because Rita blossomed into the person she should’ve been. She became a health nutritionist and a licensed massage therapist. She was a delightful person, street smart, and just enjoying the hell out of life. The possibility was always there when she was in the street. Watching her reconnect with her sisters and her kids was wonderful. They came to appreciate each other again in the way that you can when someone’s not in distress on the street. It’s really inspiring to see how someone can become restored.Explore more on these topicsUS newsHomelessnessPovertyUS politicsSocial exclusionHousingCommunitiesinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Now peregrine numbers are collapsing again in many countries and no one is quite sure whyThe age of extinction is supported byAbout this contentEvert LindquistThu 13 Mar 2025 08.00 EDTShareFor the past six years, Gordon Propp, who builds sets forBritish Columbia’s film industry, has kept a close watch over 13 peregrine falcon nests in and around Vancouver, including 10 on the city’s bridges.A self-described wildlife enthusiast and citizen scientist, Propp has had a lifelong fascination with these raptors. “To see a creature that high up the food chain adapting to an urban environment, to me, that’s quite remarkable,” says Propp.Watching peregrines (Falco peregrinus) flit about and hunt with their trademark speed, swooping in pursuit of prey at speeds of up to a staggering 250mph (400km/h), is “etched in my mind”, says Propp.But for the past couple of years, most of Propp’s winged wards have been nowhere to be found. Construction and egg predation by clever ravens can probably explain the disappearance at two locations, but he cannot explain why the other nests are empty.It is interesting that coastal populations are showing impact while those in the middle of the continent do notPatrick RedigPropp’s observations are hardly isolated. Scientists around the world have been recording plummeting peregrine populations in at least 11 countries.Name any place in the world and peregrine falcons are likely to have soared across its skies. They breed throughout the eastern US and northernCanada, as well as in Greenland, Russia and Scandinavia. They are widespread year-round along North America’s west coast, in South and Central America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, across Asia and in Australia.In North America, Skip Ambrose, a peregrine expert formerly with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, has beenmonitoring the falcons along Alaska’s Yukon River since 1973. He, too, has seen a sharpdecline in numbers.In the summer of 2023, Ambrose reported that 20 of 60 peregrine nesting sites were empty, with nearly a dozen more missing a parent. That is particularly notable because peregrines are generally loyal to both their nesting site and their partner.Ambrose’s dire observations kicked Bud Anderson into action. In May 2024, Anderson, a retired peregrine monitor who ran the now-disbanded Falcon Research Group in Washington state, helped launch a forum focusing on the mysterious declines.View image in fullscreenIt took intensive captive-breeding programmes to rebuild peregrine falcon populations after the pesticide DDT was banned in the US in 1972.Photograph: Bryan Watts/BiographicSince then, more than 100 researchers have joined to discuss hypotheses and share their own observations of dwindling peregrine populations in Denmark, south-west France, Germany, Malaysia, the Netherlands, central Norway, northern Russia, southern Sweden and Switzerland.While none of the scientists can definitively say what is going on, Ambrose says nothing has ever killed adult peregrines so quickly – not even DDT, the heavily used pesticide that nearlydrove the birds to extinctionby the 1970s.Curiously, the peregrine’s plight in North America seems most pronounced along the coasts. In New Jersey, for example, 22 of the 44 known nesting peregrines went missing during the last breeding season. In Virginia, local scientists recently noted that a dozen out of roughly 70 birds had vanished.Peregrine nests in inland Washington state, near the Cascade mountains, seem stable, Anderson says, while those on the nearby San Juan Islands are struggling.“It is interesting that coastal populations are showing impact while those in the middle of the continent, so far, do not,” says Patrick Redig, a veterinarian and president of theMidwest Peregrine Society, who helps track 200 nesting pairs across seven states.Though scientists lack an official answer as to what is driving such sudden and far-reaching disappearances, many – including David Bird, who formerly led the Avian Science and Conservation Centre at Canada’s Montreal’s McGill University in Quebec – thinkhighly pathogenic avian influenza(HPAI) may be largely to blame.Since 2022, the variant of the virus known as A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b has been spreading around the world, infecting birds but also leaping across species to cattle, foxes, seals andeven people.Bird suspects peregrine falcons could be picking up HPAI after preying on shorebirds, seabirds and waterfowl – transitory populations that may have been infected on poultry farms.View image in fullscreenA fledgling named Hugo spreads its wings at the University of Montreal last year. It is one of about 30 peregrines in the Canadian city.Photograph: Canadian Press/Rex/ShutterstockThat HPAI is to blame fits with the observations of Eve Bélisle, who has been monitoring peregrine falcons in Montreal, Canada, since 2008. Montreal’s roughly 30 or so peregrines prey on a mix of pigeons, starlings and other urban birds, but will also go after the occasional waterfowl and shorebird.Necropsies confirmed that at least two falcons in the city died of HPAI last year, while others disappeared, laid infertile eggs or lost chicks during the breeding season.Jérôme Lemaître, an avian biologist with the Quebec government, has been tracking the nesting success of peregrine falcons in the province. He says that while peregrines have not been missing from their nests, as is the case elsewhere, in 2022 the bird’s reproductive success in southern Quebec did fall from 50% to 30%, though reproduction rates rebounded in 2023. Lemaître says it is unclear what role avian influenza may have played in the decline.Without a large-scale surveillance effort across North America, determining whether avian influenza is driving the declines in peregrine falcons along the coast – and in some places even farther inland – is difficult.Live ones go in paper bags, dead ones in the freezer: the volunteers saving birds that fly into windowsRead moreBut Kathy Clark, who leads New Jersey’s endangered and non-game species programme, says that to get a better view of the situation, New Jersey and Virginia state officials may begin collecting and testing the blood of dead peregrines for HPAI starting from this breeding season.In the longer term, Guy Fitzgérald, a veterinarian who launched Quebec’s raptor rehabilitation programme, says the province’s peregrine population has plateaued and remains susceptible to further declines until the bird flu outbreak ends.If HPAI is ultimately driving the declines, Bryan Watts, an ecologist who leads the Center for Conservation Biology at William & Mary university in Williamsburg, Virginia, says North America’s peregrine falcons have a difficult journey ahead. “This disease is just going to have to work its way through, and they’re going to have to develop an immunity.”This story was originally published inbioGraphic, an independent magazine about nature and regenerationfrom the California Academy of SciencesExplore more on these topicsEnvironmentThe age of extinctionCanadaBirdsWildlifeAmericasAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad/The GuardianAt 18, Mustafa was told his only way out of prison was to join the regime forces. After 14 years, his past as one of Assad’s fighters could get him killedByGhaith Abdul-AhadThu 13 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 13 Mar 2025 07.54 EDTShareMustafa was 16 when he was detained and beaten by the police for the first time. It was early 2011, and the first stirrings of the Arab spring had grown into anti-government demonstrations across the Middle East. InSyria, a sense of anxious anticipation hung in the air, and the government was responding with propaganda films and TV shows designed to fire up nationalist sentiment. A friend of Mustafa’s hired him to play an extra in one of these shows. The job didn’t pay much, but it was more fun than the long hours Mustafa spent working in a restaurant kitchen. Tall and handsome, with dark eyes and long eyelashes, Mustafa dreamed that maybe one day he could join the long list of Syrians who starred on Arab TV dramas.The youngest of three brothers and a sister, Mustafa had grown up in a crowded working-class district in the eastern part of Damascus. His father was a stern and conservative cleric, who would beat his children for even minor infringements. At 14, Mustafa had run away and a relative in another neighbourhood had found him the restaurant job. On his first day at work, it took him four hours to peel a sack of potatoes. Within a week, he could do it in half an hour. He soon began working two shifts: mornings in the kitchen and nights making deliveries. He worked 20 hours a day. Looking back now, Mustafa thinks of this as the happiest time of his life.On the day of the shoot, Mustafa arrived in a downtown Damascus square, and joined a crowd of other extras marching in front of a large Syrian flag, chanting their love for the homeland and the president. Afterwards, feeling elated, he lingered in the square, and pulled out his mobile phone to take a picture of the scene. He did not notice the police station on the other side of the square, in the background of his photo. Two policemen approached him, asked for his ID and phone, and then, without warning, began beating him. They dragged him inside the station, threw him to the ground and stamped on him with their military boots. Then they tossed him in a filthy, dark toilet, where he remained for hours before finally being released.Sitting on the bus home, Mustafa looked up at himself in the driver’s mirror. He didn’t recognise the bruised and bloodied face staring back at him. The arbitrariness of the assault shocked him. His own shouts for mercy had disgusted him. He vowed he would never let anything like this happen to him again.Over the previous few years, police violence had increased as social unrest grew. SinceBashar al-Assadhad taken power in 2000, he had accelerated Syria’s economic liberalisation, opening up a vast divide between the wealthy and the poor. The neglected agricultural regions, already ravaged by years of drought, were the worst affected. Many unemployed workers moved to the big cities, where they often felt ostracised and depended on communal networks for support. Disillusioned by religious institutions that had long ago been co-opted by the regime, poorer people sought comfort and inspiration in more radical, socially conscious young clerics, many of whom were advocating social reform through a hardline Islamist programme.In March 2011, a few weeks after Mustafa’s encounter with the police, these tensions came to a head, as tens of thousands of Syrians took to the streets, denouncing the Assad regime and demanding freedom, justice and dignity. Even as the security forces responded to peaceful protests with violent repression, thousands of civilians continued to take to the streets. But increasingly, small bands of fighters began to assert themselves as the true leaders of the uprising. These fighters soon formed into armed Islamist factions, adopting religious symbols and rhetoric, many embracing an ultraconservative ideology. These gangs spread across Syria’s impoverished rural villages and marginalised city suburbs. President Assad and his supporters labelled civilian demonstrators and armed rebels as terrorists, portraying the regime as the protector of a secular Syria from a radical Islamist takeover.After his beating, Mustafa’s heart was gripped with terror every time he passed through a government checkpoint. He did not participate in the anti-government protests – juggling two jobs, he had hardly enough time to sleep – but he still feared his name might be flagged by the security services. He worried that his father’s status as a cleric, and the fact that his sister wore a burqa, marked the entire family as suspect in the eyes of the regime.Within months, the uprising had erupted into all-out civil war. Armed rebel groups captured towns and villages across large swathes of Syria. By May 2012, even the suburbs of Damascus, and parts of Homs, a major commercial centre, had fallen into rebel hands. The regime detained and tortured thousands of Syrians, yet they could not break the rising tide of the rebellion.In the working-class neighbourhood where Mustafa grew up and where his father still lived, pre-existing feuds were grafted on to the new political situation. Those with grievances against the government, or already wanted by the police, aligned themselves with the protesters, offering protection against regime crackdowns. Their rivals pledged loyalty to the regime, and served as informants and collaborators.One night in 2013, members of a pro-regime clan raided Mustafa’s father’s home, searching for Mustafa’s brothers who, unlike him, had joined the uprising. They ransacked the house, stole everything they could carry, and humiliated and insulted Mustafa’s father. The commander of an auxiliary force attached to an army brigade offered his protection to the family, on the condition that Mustafa and his younger brother join his troops. (Their elder brother had been detained by the regime, but managed to escape and flee to Germany.) Mustafa and his brother refused.A few nights later, Mustafa was visiting his father when he was stopped in the street and bundled into a car. That night, the commander had him brought into the local branch of the security service. His men hung him from the ceiling and beat him so severely that he lost consciousness. He woke up in a small cell packed with dozens of other detainees. Many stood, taking turns to lie down on the filthy floor. A small hole in the corner, with a tap above it, served as both a toilet and a drinking source. The air stank of sweat, blood and rotting flesh. Some of the men had been there for months, with festering wounds.After nearly three weeks of torture and starvation, Mustafa was given the same choice: either join the regime forces or remain in prison. For the second time in his life, he vowed that, no matter what happened next, he would do whatever it took to avoid prison, torture or humiliation again. He agreed to join the regime forces.Along with other young men from the neighbourhood, Mustafa was co-opted into the national defence committees – an auxiliary force attached to the fourth armoured brigade, commanded by Maher al-Assad, the president’s brother. Mustafa was stationed at a checkpoint. It was a tedious job. He spent half the week standing guard at his position, one of many fortified points along the defensive line that encircled the rebel-held strongholds of eastern Ghouta, an area east of Damascus with a population of 400,000. For the rest of the week, Mustafa lived in Damascus, working multiple odd jobs – at a motorcycle repair shop, painting houses, or as a day labourer.In these years, the regime and its allies – Iranian, Iraqi and Hezbollah fighters – were relentlessly bombarding the rebel-controlled areas in Damascus, Homs and elsewhere. They employed the same siege tactics across different parts of the country, but in eastern Ghouta it was particularly brutal. The siege lasted for years, trapping hundreds of thousands of civilians under relentless bombardment, starvation and deprivation. Entire neighbourhoods were flattened, while food and medical supplies were reduced to a trickle, controlled by regime checkpoints and war profiteers.Not long ago, in Jobar, one of the neighbourhoods that had been under siege, I met an older man, short and stocky with closely cropped white hair. “We ate everything. Once, we ate a wolf. I think it was a wolf,” he recalled with a toothless smile. He scrolled through the photos on his phone, showing me images of the dead, scores from his extended family. Some were young men in fatigues, rebel fighters, but most were civilians, children, entire families. He pointed at a hole in the ground, a dark shaft descending beneath the rubble-strewn street. “We built a city under the city,” he said. “We moved through tunnels, and lived underground.” In the house where we spoke, everything of value had been stripped away: electrical wires, sockets, doors and window frames and furniture. “We could have resisted for a hundred years,” he said. “But the hunger … the hunger was what finally broke us.”View image in fullscreenRuins in the neighbourhood of Jobar.Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad/The GuardianBack then, Mustafa did not spend much time thinking about the suffering of the other side. Working at checkpoints, he must have noticed how civilians were barred from bringing in fuel, cigarettes, or medicine. He must have seen them desperately bribing soldiers just to smuggle in meagre amounts of rice or flour.“At that time, I didn’t see the revolution as something good because the ones who ended up dominating it were the neighbourhood thugs,” said Mustafa. “They looted shops, broke into homes, and destroyed the city, all in the name of the revolution.” But he also had few illusions about his own side. “When the regime forces entered these areas, they did the same: looting, raping, killing and leaving behind nothing but destruction.”Mustafa got married, moved back into his father’s house and tried to eke out a living by buying old motorcycles, fixing and reselling them. In his neighbourhood, the pro-regime collaborators had lost interest in him after he joined up; he was one of them now. Their main concern were those who stubbornly refused to take up arms for the regime. But as Mustafa discovered, serving in one branch of the armed forces did not shield you from the others.The Assad regime maintained multiple layers of oppressive state apparatuses, with overlapping and competing intelligence branches – for the military, the air force, state security and so on – each controlling vast networks of informants. These agencies had no clear jurisdiction, often detaining individuals, torturing them, releasing them, only for them to be arrested by another branch, creating a Kafkaesque cycle of repression.Mustafa’s third arrest came in October 2017 – this time at the hands of the military police, who disregarded the fact that he was serving with the national defence militia and found him guilty of failing to report for military service. He spent two months in a dank, overcrowded cell. Detainees were not beaten or tortured as severely as they had been in Mustafa’s previous experience, but the stench and the suffocating heats were unbearable.Upon his release, Mustafa was assigned to a newly formed army brigade. His battalion commander was a young officer in his 20s, just a few years older than him. Unlike most officers, who treated soldiers like cockroaches, this one was different, he seemed kind, and he treated Mustafa and the other soldiers with respect; a rare anomaly in the hierarchy of violence and cruelty that defined the Syrian army. The officer even allowed them to pray and fast during Ramadan – something strictly forbidden in the Syrian army – which earned him the ire of senior officers. His name was Ashraf.Like Mustafa, it had never been a dream of Ashraf’s to fight for the Assad regime. When he had enrolled in military academy in 2010, Ashraf had hoped for a comfortable office job, a stable salary, maybe even a government car. It didn’t turn out like that.Ashraf had grown up in a poor Alawaite family in Hama province. His father often worked as a labourer, sometimes loading animal manure on to trucks. Other times, he joined his brothers in a small workshop producing concrete cinder blocks. When Ashraf finished high school, he was accepted into the history department at Damascus University. However, his family could not afford to support him through four years of study on the uncertain prospect that he might secure a government job after graduation. Instead, he joined the stream of Syrian labourers heading to Lebanon in search of work. He tried to find work on construction sites, but foremen considered him too young and slight. Unable to secure a job, he returned to Syria.Like many men in the Alawite community, who make up about 12% of Syria’s population, Ashraf’s only viable option was military school. For centuries, the Alawites eked out a living in the harsh, mountainous terrain of western Syria. Their society was structured around clan hierarchies, with powerful local bosses ruling over communities on behalf of feudal lords. Military service provided a stable income and a rare path out of poverty. In the five decades of the Assad family’s rule, the Alawite community experienced a significant rise in status. While some served as a praetorian guard, the community as a whole became a reliable reservoir of young rural recruits for the military and security apparatus.In the early days of the Arab spring, Ashraf didn’t quite know what to make of the uprisings. He would listen to the morning military radio broadcasts that framed the events as a foreign conspiracy orchestrated by western and Zionist forces. Then, on Facebook, he would watch videos of the demonstrations and find himself sympathising with the protesters. Yet when clashes escalated into full-scale street battles across Syria, Ashraf – like the vast majority of the Syrian military – sided with the regime against the protesters, not out of sectarian loyalty but out of fear of an Islamist jihadist takeover.By the end of 2012, Ashraf found himself in the midst of a gruelling war. Aleppo had fallen to the rebels, and fighting had spread across the whole of Syria. Isis was taking large tracts of land in the east. Most of Syria was under rebel control, with the regime holding only parts of Damascus, Homs and Hama.Foreign backers had established a presence from the early days of the war, with Hezbollah, Iran and Iraqi militias on the side of Bashar al-Assad, while Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the US, Britain and Turkey armed and supported rebel factions. But it was not until Russia got involved in September 2015 that the war reached a turning point. “The Russians intervened, bringing massive firepower,” Ashraf recalled. Thenthe heavy battles began, and the regime started gradually regaining control, forcing the rebels into retreat.During these years of fighting, the government forces were highly fragmented. Some units operated like militias, following the commands of rogue officers who acted as warlords, using their checkpoints for extortion, smuggling drugs and looting villages. There were also auxiliary units made up of civilian volunteers, alongside a host of Iranian, Iraqi, Afghan and Lebanese fighters. The Russians tried to impose some order. As a young and capable officer, Ashraf was picked to serve under the Russian command, where he underwent training and helped equip newly formed units. He was constantly on the move, shifting to a new sector every couple of months. Once an area was cleared, they would establish a base, only to withdraw and redeploy elsewhere soon after.In 2018, Ashraf was part of an offensive to secure a major highway. The operation progressed until they reached a point where the Turkish military had established an observation post. Then came an order from the Russians: no shooting beyond this line. It became clear that there was an international agreement dictating the demarcation of territories. “They told us: ‘This is it. The army has reached its designated point, and you can’t advance further.’ That was the agreement between the Turks, the Iranians and the Russians. It marked the division of Syria,” Ashraf said.For two years, the frontlines remained stable and most of the fighting ceased. By 2020, the rebel-held territory had shrunk to a small enclave in north-western Idlib, one of Syria’s poorest provinces even before the war, where millions of people were crammed into refugee camps. After nearly a decade of war, few believed Assad would be toppled.“It was the lowest point for our morale,” a leading officer in the rebel faction told me of this period. Ashraf thought the war was over.During this time, for soldiers and civilians in regime-controlled areas, the economic situation was getting worse by the day. Soldiers were not getting paid. Ashraf thought that this was worse than war; people could barely make enough money to feed their families.After 15 days at their post, soldiers were given two days’ leave, but they didn’t make enough money to get home. “They couldn’t even feed their children on the government salary, even with the extra $20 bonus they were given,” Ashraf said. “The soldiers’ salary was not enough to pay for transport, let alone cigarettes.” Since the state no longer supported its armed forces, any remaining loyalty Ashraf felt towards it evaporated. “My nation is my home, if I can only secure my home, then life is good.”Desperate for resources, the regime resorted to any means possible to extract money from the population. Those who could afford it could buy an early release from their military service for $12,000. Deserters could also pay fines and legalise their status. The most common practice for officers wastafyish,where officers pocketed the soldiers’ salaries, along with an additional monthly bribe of $150 to $200. In return, soldiers – who were badly treated, underpaid and underfed – were allowed to return to their home towns and work civilian jobs. The officers, who themselves were poorly paid, gathered as many bribe-paying soldiers under their command as their rank and influence allowed, effectively transforming a large sector of the Syrian army into a serf-like workforce. For these officers, their tafyish soldiers were a kind of commodity, to be jealously guarded or traded to higher-ranking officers when the opportunity arose.Under this system, Mustafa managed to spend most of his military service at home in Damascus, juggling multiple jobs to scrape together a living. He and his wife had a son. Mustafa always paid his officers their bribes punctually and even provided extra favours – a house paint job here, a car repair there. Mustafa would pay Ashraf, who would pass the payment up the chain of command.Mustafa was a survivor. Not everyone who had been detained by regime forces early in the war chose to join the militias, but he did – out of fear and self-preservation. He disdained the violence deployed by both the regime and the rebels. He sought compromises to navigate the realities of war; his only desire was to be left alone so he could scrape together enough money to get himself out of poverty, but each decision led him deeper into the chaos.When he bribed officers to return to Damascus, he still lived under the constant risk of being stopped at checkpoints and questioned about why he was not at his military post. To avoid trouble, he paid money to obtain a permit to carry a gun – not because he wanted a gun, but because simply flashing the licence at a checkpoint ensured safe passage. Yet, in the end, that permit would return to haunt him.As the years passed, Ashraf felt increasingly detached. He still wore his uniform but saw himself and others in the army more and more as expendable tools in a war dictated by outside powers. The fractures within the army were obvious. Officers like him were poor and exhausted. Some of his colleagues were moonlighting as fuel smugglers from neighbouring Lebanon. Others still clung to the war as a means of preserving their power.In late November 2024, Mustafa received an unexpected phone call from Ashraf, his senior officer, telling him to return to his military unit immediately. The call had nothing to do with developments in the war. It was more urgent than that: another officer had accused their commander of taking bribes. Ashraf assured Mustafa that he only needed to stay at the base for a few days, just long enough for things to quiet down. Mustafa donned his ill-fitting military uniform and headed to the base, carrying with him a ceramic washbasin, a gift for his commanding officer whom he and others had bribed to let them stay home.That same day, Israeli jets struck targets along Syria’s border with Lebanon as part of their war with Hezbollah; to the east, American forces hit Iranian positions in retaliation for an attack on US bases; to the north, Kurdish and pro-Turkish forces exchanged artillery fire; and in the Idlib countryside, not far from Mustafa’s base, the army continued shelling rebel-held villages.All in all, it was just another day in Syria’s 14-year-old civil war. None of the participants, not even the rebels preparing their long-awaited military operation against the regime, suspected that within just a few weeks, the war would be over.Early on the morning of 27 November 2024, two rebel columns launched coordinated attacks on Syrian army positions in the countryside west of Aleppo, overwhelming government forces with their speed and coordination. Drones struck key communication and command hubs, as well as artillery batteries.Over the previous four years, the rebel forces had transformed themselves. Gone were the old ragtag rebel fighters in mismatched uniforms and tracksuits. In their place emerged a more professional force made up of soldiers in military uniforms and flak jackets, carrying modern weapons and communications equipment. Rebel units advanced rapidly, cutting off supply lines and forcing regime troops into retreat. By the next day, advanced rebel units had reached the outskirts of Aleppo. After 36 hours of fighting, Aleppo, Syria’s second largest city, fell to the rebels, a conquest some of their leaders had envisaged would take months.Isolated in their camp near Idlib, wary that some of the soldiers would denounce others to the regime’s security services and convinced they were under surveillance, Mustafa and his fellow soldiers struggled to understand what was happening. On 28 November, Mustafa approached his senior officer, Ashraf, who confirmed that Aleppo had fallen, but offered little else. “I’ll have more answers later tonight,” he assured him.The following night, Ashraf, along with two other battalion commanders, were summoned to the general’s quarters. There, under a thick haze of cigarette smoke, the men drank whisky and discussed the unfolding crisis. The general admitted there were no clear orders from army command, no explanation of what was happening on the ground, only the usual rhetoric of defiance blaring from regime-controlled radio and television.The next day, Ashraf rang a few fellow officers at brigade headquarters, and they all assured him that reinforcements were coming. But as the rebels continued their advance, Ashraf wondered whether these reinforcements even existed. He listened to the military reports and followed the rebels’ progress on the map in disbelief. Town after town was falling without resistance – Ma’ara, Saraqib, Khan Sheikhun. Only in one mountainous area did army units and villages resist, fearing they would be slaughtered. Elsewhere, from Aleppo to Hama, army units withdrew without firing a shot.View image in fullscreenA Syrian waves the flag of HTS on Mount Qasioun, overlooking Damascus.Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad/The GuardianOn 1 December, the general gave orders for Ashraf’s brigade to abandon its fortified positions and withdraw 20 miles to the south. Shortly after the brigade arrived at their new quarters, a former agricultural institute in the town of Sqilbiya, a fleet of black vans belonging to a loyalist battalion pulled up. Military intelligence officers stepped out and detained the general. A new brigade leader was swiftly appointed. Military intelligence officers passed out weapons to the villagers in the area – who were mostly Shia and Ismailis, wary of the advance of the rebels, many of whom had jihadi backgrounds – to form a cordon behind the soldiers, blocking any further withdrawal. In front of Mustafa and Ashraf were the rebels; behind them were armed villagers and state security. They were stuck in the middle.As the rebel forces advanced, Mustafa, Ashraf and the other soldiers remained in their new barracks. Soldiers who had once laid siege to rebel enclaves were now themselves trapped with no access to food or medicine. They had not received rations for five days, not even bedding for the freezing winter nights. They had not been paid, leaving them without money to buy food or cigarettes. Not that it mattered. The armed villagers behind them, loyal to the regime, would not have allowed them to enter a nearby village to purchase supplies.Isolated, with no access to news or the internet, they had little understanding of what was happening around them. They feared making calls, knowing that the regime still tightly controlled the phone networks. At night, Mustafa and a friend, a former schoolteacher, would whisper about the course of the war. The teacher told him that it was all over, that the regime was going to fall. But he also warned Mustafa against trying to defect on his own. If they were to escape, it had to be a coordinated mass defection.They began speaking with other soldiers, who were equally determined to defect. They had heard from a fellow soldier in Aleppo that the rebels were not behaving as they had before – they weren’t killing or torturing enemy soldiers who had defected. Instead, they disarmed them and let them go. For years, soldiers and militia had chosen to fight to the end rather than surrender, fearing they would be executed. It was a fate they had seen in numerous gruesome videos filmed by rebel soldiers over the course of the war. But in Aleppo, everything seemed to have changed. When word spread that captured soldiers were not being harmed, they began defecting in droves.The army that had fought for 14 years was collapsing in a matter of days. “Maybe there were orders not to fight,” Ashraf said. “But there was also exhaustion – 14 years of it. No one could bear it any more. Our economic situation was in ruins. I couldn’t even feed my own children, so why would I keep fighting?”On 7 December, Ashraf and Mustafa’s unit mounted their tanks and personnel carriers, but instead of advancing on the enemy, they turned towards the villagers, who were still loyal to the regime. A tense standoff ensued. “We told them we would fight our way through if they didn’t move,” Mustafa recalled. “But they refused. We told them the rebels were already in Damascus.”After hours of negotiations, the deserters with their tanks and armoured vehicles forced their way through the cordon. With tanks leading the way, they drove for nearly four hours south towards Damascus. At dawn, the soldiers began receiving phone calls: the rebels had broken into the prisons, and reached the television station. The unit, now about a couple of hundred of them, abandoned their armoured vehicles and tanks, shedding their uniforms, and continued on foot.They walked for nearly five hours before coming across a group of rebels in mud-spattered SUVs and pickup trucks. The rebels ordered the soldiers to surrender their weapons and destroy their military ID cards. By midday, they reached a bridge near Masyaf, a city 140 miles north of Damascus. Mustafa and the others, dressed in their tracksuits, stood aside and watched as a massive column of rebel vehicles drove past – brand-new SUVs and pickup trucks mounted with anti-aircraft guns.“They didn’t even stop for us,” Mustafa recalled. “They jeered and laughed. And I thought, these pickups would have stood no chance against the tanks we had just abandoned, if we had stayed and fought.” Like other units all over Syria, the 76th mechanised division had melted away.Mustafa arrived in Damascus, his feet bruised and blistered, but elated that the nightmare was over. “I thought, I am free,” he recalled. “I didn’t care if Syria was free, all I thought was, I am free.”A week later, Mustafa visited Sednaya, the most notorious prison in Syria. After the fall of the regime, crowds had surrounded the prison, breaking down walls, using jackhammers to dig through concrete floors in search of secret cells, where they believed thousands were still imprisoned. Many dispersed when they realised that, beyond the few thousand men who had emerged in the first hours, there was no one else left alive. On the day Mustafa arrived, some people were still milling around the prison yard or sifting through thousands of documents strewn across the floors or piled high in storage rooms, desperately searching for a clue about the fate of their loved ones – a name, a picture, anything. Mustafa’s purpose was different: he wanted to see for himself if all the stories he had been hearing for years were in fact true. In the dark kitchen halls on the ground floor, Mustafa stood in front of iron stoves brimming with the ash of burned documents.One rebel fighter, named Omar, walked down a dark corridor lined with small cells. He and two of his men peered into each cell, screwing up their faces at the stench before moving to the next. Omar roared at anyone standing nearby, demanding to know where the hidden cells were. Standing in a cell littered with dirty blankets, he said: “Those soldiers of Assad were worse than the Mongols and Tartars in the brutality they imposed on the people – worshippers of monkeys and pigs.” Then he turned and walked out.View image in fullscreenA man looking for his missing son in the Sednaya prison.Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad/The Guardian“Worshippers of monkeys and pigs,” Mustafa hissed under his breath. The term was a common insult used against Shia and Alawites. “They [the rebels] all lived in the north, [in rebel-held areas] free from Bashar, and now they come here and insult us. Do they have any idea what we went through?” he added.I followed Omar to speak to him. He was there to find his brother, he said. When he was 10, his two elder brothers were detained and his family fled from Damascus to the rebel-controlled Idlib province. A few years later, the family received news that the elder brother had been executed. But rumours persisted about the other brother – someone had seen him, someone had spoken to a prisoner who swore he was alive. As he spoke, Omar’s eyes burned with anger, but with his round, chubby face, there was also something childlike about him. He had been fighting for a decade, but he was still only 24.As Omar was about to leave, a woman approached one of his men and said she had found an entrance outside the prison walls, one she was certain led to a hidden underground passage. Omar went with the woman in a small taxi. She sat in the front, while he squeezed his hefty frame into the backseat. His two men followed behind in their SUV.The two cars drove along the service road that skirted the massive concrete bulk of the prison. A deep, wide moat ran alongside the road, separating it from a vast stretch of land littered with boulders and shrubs. The moat was just a dry trench, but Omar feared it was lined with mines. When the cars came to a stop, the woman pointed toward a small patch of disturbed earth in the distance, at the edge of the moat. “That’s the entrance to the underground chambers,” she said.Omar and the two men skidded down the earthen embankment to the bottom of the moat. Omar took the lead, instructing the men behind him to step exactly where he stepped. A small herd of goats stood above the moat, oblivious to the imagined mines, watching curiously. The barren hills stretched beyond, silent and indifferent.The men found nothing. By the time they returned to their starting point, where the woman was standing, the sun was setting, casting long shadows across the dry earth. “Can’t you call the military command to send digging equipment?” the woman asked angrily. “I know the passage is here.”She pointed at different patches of earth. At first, Omar and his men dutifully followed her instructions, prodding the ground with their bayonets. Any fear of landmines faded, replaced by exhaustion. As the woman frantically pointed at different spots, it became clear there was no secret entrance. She sat on the ground, weeping. “Three brothers I had. They took them one after the other. For 10 years, I have been looking for them,” she sobbed.Omar squatted on the edge of the moat, opposite her, and covered his face with his hands. The fierce, angry warrior faded away, revealing the boy still searching for his brother. Silently, he cried.The woman called for revenge, her voice trembling, but Omar tried to reassure her. “It will come,” he said. “All in good time. Every one of them, those Alawi pigs, will be slaughtered and hung for the crimes they committed,” he said, his mouth quivering with anger. “I promise you, we will wipe them all out.”When the forces of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Islamist group that led the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad’s regime, swept into Damascus at the end of the war, they found a city that looked old and exhausted, worn out by years of violence and crippling sanctions, its Ottoman and Mamluk architecture blackened by the fumes of rattling old cars and buses. Its people, wrapped in shabby clothes, stood in long queues for bread, which stretched along the sidewalks. Inflation was skyrocketing and stalls openly sold smuggled Lebanese fuel, and exchanged dollars in the street – the mere mention of which would previously have landed people in jail.View image in fullscreenA woman holds the ID card of a detainee.Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad/The GuardianMarjeh square, also known as Martyrs’ Square, in the centre of the city, became a symbol of the roughly 150,000 people who had gone missing since the start of the war. At the centre of the square stands the Telegraph Column, an ornate monument built in 1905 by an Italian architect to mark the completion of the telegraph line connecting Damascus to Mecca. One day in December, someone must have first hung a flyer there – a single sheet of A4 paper with a photograph, a name, and a phone number, taped to the base of the monument. Then others followed. Within weeks, the base had turned white, plastered with hundreds of these desperate notices. Men climbed, sticking the flyers higher and higher, long past the point where anyone could read the names or numbers. The mere act of hanging a picture was in a way an act of acknowledging their existence publicly after years of fear.What didn’t happen in the weeks after the fall of Damascus was almost as significant as what did. Unlike Baghdad in 2003, most public buildings and state institutions were neither looted nor burned, and life resumed quickly. Traffic clogged the streets, edging slowly past abandoned trucks and armoured vehicles. Discarded military uniforms piled up like street trash. Jubilant crowds filled the yards of the iconic Umayyad mosque, where foreign jihadis brushed shoulders with young Syrians waving revolutionary flags and posing for selfies. Young men flocked back into the city, many setting foot in Damascus for the first time in years after staying away to avoid conscription. The hated military checkpoints had been dismantled – only a few traces remained, a burned-out shell, an abandoned military Jeep.In the ministries, employees of the former government resumed work under a new administration. They huddled in their overcrowded offices around small heaters, uncertain about their future, while upstairs, their new bosses – most of whom had come down to Damascus from the religiously conservative and economically liberal local administration of rebel-controlled Idlib – began their work in dismantling the legacy of the former regime.The new administrators were baffled by how backwards Damascus seemed. They complained about the sluggish internet, the suffocating bureaucracy and the meagre salaries. “He [Bashar] had committed countless crimes against us, but we were the opposition,” Mohammad Ghazal, the newly appointed deputy minister in the ministry of local affairs in Damascus, told me in his office. “But these people here? They are his people, they lived under his rule all these years, and this is how they were left? All they can think about now is how to make it through the day.”“Isee that 14 years of my life have been wasted,” Ashraf told me, when I met him in his village a few weeks after the fall of the regime. “If I had studied history, I would have been a teacher by now, still receiving my salary. But now, all of that is gone.”View image in fullscreenA man poses for pictures on top of an abandoned Syrian army tank.Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad/The GuardianAt home in his village, the poverty that had driven Ashraf to join the army was everywhere around him – in his small living room with its bare concrete floor, in his father’s old, tattered coat, in the rough tobacco they smoked. With the army and security forces disbanded and tens of thousands of government employees sent home – many of them Alawites – a growing sense of persecution was taking hold within Ashraf’s community.He felt he had been betrayed twice over: once by the regime that he served and then, when it fell, by the rebels. By not fighting, he and other officers thought they would be rewarded by the new rulers in Damascus. Instead they were fired from their jobs, and they spent their days fearing reprisals. The rebels had managed – at least in major cities – to prevent widespread revenge attacks on former regime loyalists. Initially, Ashraf told me, HTS fighters entered his village and held a meeting with the elders, assuring them that all was well. But in much of the countryside, especially in areas where Sunni and Alawite villages coexisted, dozens of Alawite men had been kidnapped. Some had been summarily executed, others had disappeared. “My fears now,” Ashraf said, “are not of the regime any more, but of the gangs roaming the countryside and the people calling for vengeance.”In December, when I spoke to a senior member of the HTS political bureau in Damascus, he told me that many involved in the revolution were enraged by the presence of people from the former regime still serving in state institutions. “We are fully convinced that many of these people remain loyal to the former regime,” he admitted. But he was also conscious that there were 4 million members of Assad’s Ba’ath party in Syria. “If they were to organise around a central figure, they could mobilise to form a counter-revolution. In other words, this is a very sensitive issue that we have to deal with calmly,” he said.“Now, displaced Syrians are returning to their towns and villages, and some of them find themselves living next to individuals who had imprisoned or killed their relatives. Imagine how difficult it is to control such emotions,” he said. He feared that revenge killings against the Alawites could spiral out of control. The only solution was for alleged victims to pursue justice in the courts, he said. “Only this way, we can preserve peace.”On 6 March, nearly three months after Damascus fell, a group of former regime officers attacked units from the newly formed Ministry of Defence and Interior in villages in the heart of the Alawite areas. Nearly 100 fighters from the new government were killed and 125 loyalist insurgents. What followed was a bloodbath. Government forces and battalions under their command attacked Alawite towns and villages, killing 1,225 civilians over one weekend, including women and children, execution style, often filming their brutal acts, forcing the men to crawl and howl like dogs before executing them. Bodies piled up in the streets as the fighters chanted sectarian slogans.When I reached Ashraf on the phone, he spoke in a low voice, afraid of being overheard. He said he was staying with his brothers, and they had watched with terror as the convoys of armed soldiers from the new government drove past their house. In two neighbouring villages, civilians were killed, but Sunnis in Ashraf’s village had protected them so far.“I don’t know what to do,” he said on the phone. He sounded fearful. “We can’t leave the area because anyone seen outside is being killed. We just sit here and wait, expecting them to attack the house at any minute.”Late last year, Mustafa was arrested for the fourth time, this time by a couple of men from the neighbourhood who claimed they were working for HTS. Someone in the neighbourhood had informed them that Mustafa had a gun permit issued before the fall of the regime, and the two men demanded that he hand over the gun. Blindfolded, he was led to the same security service building where he had been first arrested more than a decade ago, now appropriated by the new regime. A few hours later, friends intervened and he was released.“At least I wasn’t tortured this time,” Mustafa told me, scowling at the bowl of lentil soup in front of him. We were sitting in a restaurant in the centre of Damascus, an old establishment where the waiters wore suits and tried to intimidate clients with their haughty attitude. “I can cook much better lentils,” Mustafa said. “It doesn’t have enough lemon.”He said that his dream was to save enough money so that one day he could open a restaurant, but his life had taken another tragic twist. His wife left him, took their child and all his money; she had called her brothers to help her strip the house, took everything and left. In this new reality, Mustafa felt very weak and exposed. His wife had a hold on him, he said, because she knew that he feared his past as a collaborator could come to light.In the meantime, he said, he would join the security branch of HTS, which has been renamed the general security directorate of the new Syrian administration.I asked him why.“Because,” he replied, “you can’t survive on your own in this country.”Some names have been changedListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readSyriaBashar al-AssadIslamMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, obviously, this would be transformative for the fortunes of Farage’s party, and he was extremely excited about the prospect.“Now, all of that kind of went south around Christmastime …[when Musk published] a tweet saying Farage doesn’t have what it takes to lead Reform UK, and they need somebody else.”Support the Guardian today:theguardian.com/todayinfocuspodPhotograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAExplore more on these topicsReform UKToday in FocusNigel FarageRupert Lowe"

She lost her seven-year-old son, Thiago, in the flood.More than 600,000 Brazilians, 46 local governments and about 2,000 businesses aresuing BHP over the disaster in a lawsuitworth up to £36bn.The lawsuit, one of the largest in English legal history, began in October and ended on Thursday with closing submissions.“I will produce a judgment as soon as I can,” the judge, Finola O’Farrell, said as she announced the end of the trial.Pamela Fernandes, 31, lost her five-year-old daughter, Manu. “The memories of Manu are always with me … it’s very difficult,” she said.Fernandes, who like Silva wore a T-shirt bearing her late child’s picture, said: “I want justice so that I can be at peace, so that my daughter can be at peace.”BHP said the London lawsuit duplicated legal proceedings and reparation and repair programmes in Brazil, and should be thrown out. It also said nearly $8bn (£6.2bn) had been paid to those affected through the Renova Foundation, with about $1.7bn going to claimants involved in the English case.BHP argues it did not own or operate the dam, which held mining waste known as tailings. It said a Brazilian subsidiary of its Australian holding company was a 50% shareholder in Samarco, which operated independently.The company also said it had no knowledge that the dam’s stability was compromised before it collapsed.‘You are killing us’: Mariana survivors face ill health, lost culture and a long wait for justiceRead moreThe Brazilian government signed a compensation deal with BHP, Vale and Samarco in October, but Tom Goodhead, the chief executive of Pogust Goodhead, has said victims of the disaster were not involved.Representing the claimants, he said on Thursday that the trial was about accountability.“If the company is [found liable], it will be the biggest victory for us … it would have been worth waiting 10 years,” Silva said.Explore more on these topicsMiningBrazilBHPAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Around 5.30pm officers droveinto the crowds on motorbikes, pointing guns at the demonstrators and causing hundreds to flee.Footage circulating on social media showed an elderly woman being hit with a baton and being knocked to the ground, her head soon covered in blood. In another, an elderly man wearing a football shirt is seen being beaten by police.A freelance photographer and activist was also left in a critical condition, after being hit in thehead with a teargas canister. Pablo Grillo reportedly suffered a skull fracture and loss of brain mass, a graphic photo of which was shared online. The 35-year-old was rushed to a hospital where he underwent emergency surgery and remains in an induced coma.View image in fullscreenMedics tend to a photographer injured during clashes as police confronted demonstrators in Buenos Aires.Photograph: Rodrigo Abd/APHis father, Fabián Grillo,blamedthe president and national security minister, Patricia Bullrich, and said: “My son’s life is in danger.” Bullrich responded by calling the photographer an activist.The Argentinian Graphic Reporters Association (aRGra) is demanding Bullrich’s resignation. “Today our former student was vilely and seriously injured by security forces,” their statement said. “We demand that the president of the republic immediately remove her and her subordinates from office and bring them to justice. Otherwise we make him [Milei] morally, politically and criminally complicit in the crimes committed by his minister.”Hundreds of people protested peacefully, chanting from the sidelines. But others threw stones, firecrackers and bottles at police containment lines. A police van and rubbish cans were also set ablaze. Al Jazeera reported that a police officer had been shot.Preliminary figures from the independent human rights group Comisión Nacional por la Memoria suggest more than 500 people were injured.More than 100 peoplewere detained, authorities said, with Bullrichalleging on TVthat organised and violent football fans had turned up “prepared to kill”.‘Financial suffocation’: Argentina’s medics fear impact of Milei’s chainsaw cutsRead moreAxel Kicillof, the opposition governor of Buenos Aires province,condemnedthe government’s “ferocious, illegal and premeditated” repression of the protest. “While a photographer fights for his life, government spokespeople lie, justify violence, and spread hatred. This authoritarian rampage must be urgently curbed,” he said.Retirees were described as thebiggest losersduring Milei’s first year in office, with pension increases falling significantly under inflation and the list of free medications being cut.Nearly 60% of retirees receive only the minimum pension payment, which amounts to approximately $340 a month.From 23 March,those who have not completed 30 years of contributions will reportedly be unable to access the retirement pot – estimates suggest thousands will be affected.Liliana Morono, a 73-year-old pensioner and grandmother, attended Wednesday’s protest for the first time. “Milei’s government is reducing our money every month, we can’t live, we can’t buy medications,” she said.“I can’t understand how any Argentinian could vote for this crazy man who is so sick and full of hate. He has created a clash, a division, across our country,” she added.Manuel Adorni, the presidential spokesperson, dismissed the demonstration as a politically motivated stunt.Bullrich said: “InArgentina, the law rules, not the hooligans or the left.”Explore more on these topicsArgentinaAmericasJavier MileinewsShareReuse this content"

Trump has meanwhile repeatedly called forCanadato become the 51st US state – a taunt seen by some north of the border as an annexation threat.The new rule was published on the Federal Registrar on Wednesday as freshUS tariffsof 25% came into effect onsteel and aluminum– widely seen as a blow to Canada, which already faces a separate 25% levy on other goods. Canada, in turn,announced retaliatory tariffson nearly C$30bn worth of American imports.It will probably affect the estimated 900,000 Canadians – known colloquially as “snowbirds” – who spend winters in warmer southern US states such as Florida, Texas and South Carolina.The Department of Homeland Security estimates that between 2.2 million and 3.2 million people will be affected by the new visitor registration rules.The immigration attorney Rosanna Berardi said: “It’s important to clarify that this measure specifically impacts Canadian citizens crossing land borders who intend to remain in the United States for periods exceeding 30 days.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The tariffs have started a chain reaction of retaliatory tariffs as countries around the world decide how to respond to Trump’s policy.Canada’s announcement comes after the EUannouncedits own tariffs on American imports, including products such as motorcycles and whiskey, totaling $28bn.Trump had doubled the steel and aluminum tariffs againstCanada, in retaliation for Canada raising the prices on electricity exports to the US, to 50%. But the White House dropped the measure after Canada said it would hold off on its electricity tariff.Meanwhile, the Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, said the country would wait until 2 April to determine whether it would respond to the steel and aluminum tariffs.Trump had initially announced 25% tariffs on all imports from Canada and Mexico, which were initially to take effect on 1 February, but paused the tariffs twice. The tariffs are now expected to go into effect on 2 April.EU retaliates against Trump tariffs with €26bn ‘countermeasures’Read moreCanadian and EU leaders voiced regret over the impact the tariffs will have on domestic businesses, but argued countries need to respond appropriately to Trump’s actionsMélanie Joly, the country’s minister of foreign affairs, said in a press conference on Wednesday that the country will “not back down and we will not give into this coercion”, denouncing the chaos Trump has ensued on the global economy.“The only constant in this unjustified and unjustifiable trade war seems to be President Trump’s talks of annexing our country’s through economic coercion,” Joly told a press conference.Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission,saidthat the steel and aluminum tariffs were “unjustified trade restrictions”. “Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business and worse for consumers. They are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy,” she said.Despite the criticism from global leaders, Trump defended the tariffs after meeting with the Business Roundtable, a group of key US business leaders on Tuesday. “Markets are going to go up and they’re going to go down, but you know what? We have to rebuild our country,” Trump said on Tuesday.After a weeklong slump, US markets started making small gains on Tuesday morning after inflation figures that were better than projected.Trump and members of his administration have spent the last week on the cable news circuit downplaying the impacts the tariffs could have on the economy. When asked whether the US could experience a recession in aninterviewwith Fox News on Sunday, Trump said the country was in a “period of transition”.“What we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America. That’s a big thing. And there are always periods of, it takes a little time. It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us,” Trump said.Kevin Hassett, head of the national economic council,toldCNBC on Monday that Trump’s economic policies were having their intended effect of “creating jobs in the US” and said there were lots of reason to be “bullish going forward”.The uncertainty around Trump’s trade policies has made officials with the Federal Reserve all but confirm that they will not be changing interest rates at their meeting next week. The Fed chair, Jerome Powell, said in prepared remarks last week that there was “heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook” but said that the economy was stable for now.“It remains to be seen how these developments might affect future spending and investment,” he said.Meanwhile, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll found that most Americans have found Trump’s recent actions on the economy to be “too erratic”. Some 70% of themore than 1,400 respondents– including nine in 10 Democrats and six in 10 Republicans – said they expected higher tariffs would make groceries and other purchases more expensive. Americans instead want Trump to continue to focus on combating high prices even as there are growing concerns his policies will drive costs up, not down, the poll found.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsCanadaAmericasDonald TrumpUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

The prosecutor said the alleged offences were “committed by a criminal organisation” and had been practised regularly and discreetly from 2021 to the present.Since the first Donald Trump administration, European countries have facedintense pressure from the US not to use Huawei equipmentin their 5G networks on national security grounds.A Huawei spokesperson said the company took the allegations seriously and would urgently communicate with the investigation to further understand the situation. “Huawei has a zero-tolerance policy towards corruption or other wrongdoing, and we are committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations at all times,” they said.People involved in the alleged criminal “cash for influence” scheme are suspected to have been paid for taking political positions or to have received “excessive gifts” such as food, travel expenses and invitations to football matches. All this was done for “promoting purely private commercial interests in the context of political decisions”, the prosecutor said.Investigators are also examining whether money laundering took place, as they suspect intermediaries may have received payments to disguise the trail.The allegations were first reported by the Belgian media and the investigative outlet Follow the Money, whichsaid that about 15 current and former MEPs were “on the radar” of investigators.The authorities said “several people” had been arrested for questioning, including one male suspect in France under a European arrest warrant, but declined to give further details. More than 21 searches were carried out by more than 100 police officers across Belgium and in Portugal.A European parliament spokesperson said: “We have received a request for cooperation from the Belgian authorities to assist the investigation, which the parliament will swiftly and fully honour.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I said this already, that I will protect you, and I will be responsible for everything,” he said.The video message, which appeared to have been filmed on board the aircraft thatbrought him to the Netherlandsto face charges of crimes against humanity, were his first comments to the Philippines public since hisdramatic arrest on Tuesday.Rodrigo Duterte’s arrest could be telling blow in the Philippines’ dynastic feudRead moreDressed in a plain white shirt, and speaking to the camera, he said: “This will be a long legal proceeding. But I say to you, I will continue to serve the country. So be it. If that is my destiny. Thank you”.Duterte has previously said he offered “no apologies, no excuses” for his bloody anti drugs crackdowns which activists say may have killed as many as 30,000 people.Duterte’s plane landed at Rotterdam airport at just before 5pm local time on Wednesday, and he was transferred to a detention unit on the Dutch coast.In a statement the ICC confirmed it had taken custody of the former leader, with the court’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, calling it “a crucial step in our continuous work to ensure accountability for the victims of the most serious crimes under ICC jurisdiction.”Duterteis the first former leader of an Asian country to be served an arrest warrant filed by the ICC.In a statement the ICC said its chamber, composed of three judges, had assessed material submitted by office of the prosecutor and found reasonable grounds to believe that Duterte is “individually responsible as an indirect co-perpetrator for the crime against humanity of murder, allegedly committed in thePhilippinesbetween 1 November 2011 and 16 March 2019.”A hearing will be scheduled “in due course” for Duterte’s initial appearance before the court, it said, which will confirm his identity and the language in which he is able to follow the proceedings. It is not clear when a trial will begin.Supporters of the former leader gathered at The Hague Penitentiary Institution, waiving the Philippines flag and chanting “bring him back”. While rights experts and victims’ families have been overjoyed by the news of Duterte’s arrest, the former leader retains a strong support base, especially in the south of the country.“I am OK, do not worry,” Duterte, who will turn 80 this month, said in the video message. His daughter, Sara Duterte, the vice-president, also arrived in The Hague on Wednesday evening to offer support.Lawyers for Duterte on Wednesday filed a petition on behalf of his youngest daughter, Veronica, accusing the government of “kidnapping” him, and demanding he be returned to the Philippines.Duterte’s supporters have argued that, as the Philippines withdrew from the Rome statute in 2019, the ICC no longer has jurisdiction. However, the court has previously said it retains jurisdiction for alleged crimes that occurred in the country before its withdrawal.The country’s president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, who once ran in an alliance with vice-president Sara Duterte but is nowembroiled in a bitter feudwith the family, told reporters this week he was confident “the arrest was proper, correct and followed all necessary legal procedures”.Explore more on these topicsRodrigo DutertePhilippinesInternational criminal courtAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

They’re internally inconsistent. So on one hand, he says we’re going to have all these tariffs to make all this tariff revenue to be able to cut taxes – noting that the tax cuts are for the rich. At the same time, he says we’re going to onshore everything. So America will produce everything at home. Either have lots of tariff revenue, or you’re producing everything at home – you don’t get both.“Then the other problem is, even if you are producing everything at home – and the US conceivably can do that, unlike Australia – they’ll be a lot poorer. So the US is really shooting themselves in the foot.”Are Trump’s tariffs the beginning of a global trade war and should Australians be worried?Read moreGordon, a former chief economist at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, said retaliatory tariffs would simply lead to Australians paying more for imported goods.She argued the best option would be to use the World Trade Organisation to mount a unified defence of free trade alongside other trade-reliant countries, such as South Korea, Japan and even China.The United States is Australia’s number one international market for beef, lamb and goat meat.

What we won’t do is to punish Australians by lifting prices, which is what tariffs would do,” Albanese told ABC radio.Graph showing Australia’s trade balance with the United StatesThe three states that drive beef and sheep meat production and export are Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales.The general manager of international markets at Meat & Livestock Australia, Andrew Cox, said the red meat industry “supports free and fair trade” and that the US is “a highly valued and long-term trading partner”.“We are watching the trade environment very closely and are avoiding speculation about any tariffs that would drive up prices of food,” Cox said.Explore more on these topicsBusinessAustralian economyDonald TrumpEconomicsAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Asked what impact the plan would have on women with caregiving duties, he replied: “There are plenty of job-sharing arrangements.“I don’t think it’s unreasonable that people, like in many other workplaces, are asked to go back to work for that face-to-face contact,” he told 2GB radio.“That’s exactly what will happen if there’s a change of government after the election.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailOn Thursday, Dutton appeared to walk those comments back, saying levels of working from home in the public service should return to pre-Covid levels.Some senior Coalition figures and candidates who spoke to Guardian Australia on the condition of anonymity said there were “no positives” to the policy. The Coalition should be more focused on the cost of living instead, they said.“Flexible work arrangements are cherished in many households, and it looks like we [the Coalition] don’t get that,” one said.Some said there was growing discontent about the Coalition’s economic policy, that it was not robust enough, and the work from home policy added to those concerns, they said.“It does nothing to actually build [our economic policy] or point to what we’re good at,” a senior Liberal source said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You essentially need to get staff to agree by majority to vary the agreement, or you have to wait until the agreement is expired and renegotiate,” he said.“If there was a new blanket policy of saying no to these [flexible work] requests, it’s clearly foreseeable that you end up with cases in the Fair Work Commission and in the courts.”But Stewart said there was scope to shift the balance between work from home and work from office arrangements within the current agreement.Other Coalition insiders who supported the policy agreed there was a risk it was being misinterpreted. They added that maintaining flexible arrangements in the workplace, including in the public service, were important.One MP said employees and employers “should have the opportunity” to come to an arrangement.Labor’s Katy Gallagher, the minister for the public service and women, claimed the policy showed the opposition had “no idea” how working families operate. She said workplace agreements in the public service already set parameters on how staff can work from home.“The EBA [enterprise bargaining agreement] is clear. Employees have a right to request working from home arrangements and employers have the right to approve or not approve that,” she told reporters.Gallagher also criticised Dutton’s apparent backflip, saying that “policy ideas copied from the US won’t work for Australian families”, referencing Donald Trump calling time on public servants working from home.Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsCoalitionPeter DuttonAustralian election 2025newsShareReuse this content"

But he suggested thatUkraineshould neither rearm nor mobilise and that western military aid to Kyiv be halted during the 30-day ceasefire.Donald Trump responded briefly before a meeting with the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, saying Putin had“made a very promising statement, but it was not complete”.The US president said he was “ready to talk” to Putin. “We will see ifRussiaagrees, and if not, it will be a very disappointing moment,” he said. “I would like to see a ceasefire from Russia. We hope that Russia will do the right thing.”Putin claimed Ukraine was seeking a ceasefire because of the battlefield situation, asserting that Russian forces were “advancing almost everywhere” and nearing full control of the Kursk region, where Kyiv launched a surprise incursion last year.“How will these 30 days of [ceasefire] be used? To continue forced mobilisation in Ukraine? To supply weapons to Ukraine? … These are legitimate questions,” he said.Ukraine has previously indicated it would continue its mobilisation efforts during any ceasefire.“We need to discuss this with our American partners– perhaps a call with Donald Trump,” Putin added, thanking the US president for his involvement in the peace negotiations.Ukraine ceasefire: what’s in the proposed deal – and what’s notRead moreBy avoiding an outright rejection of Trump’s proposal, Putin appears to be balancing between not openly rebuffing Trump’s push for peace while also imposing his own stringent demands – potentially prolonging negotiations.Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, dismissed Putin’s ambivalent response to the proposal as “manipulative”.“We now have all heard from Putin’s very predictable, very manipulative words in response to the idea of a ceasefire,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly address. “As we have always said, the only one who will drag things out, the only one who will be unconstructive, is Russia.”Zelenskyy said Putin was “afraid to say directly to President Trump that he wants to continue this war”, accusing the Russian leader of “framing the idea of a ceasefire with such preconditions that nothing will work out at all, or for as long as possible”.1:54Zelenskyy says 'manipulative' Putin does not want ceasefire – videoSpeaking from the White House, Trump went into further detail on the US negotiations with Russia and Ukraine, saying that a “lot of individual subjects have been discussed”.Trump indicated that the US and Ukraine had discussed “pieces of land that would be kept and lost, and all of the other elements of a final agreement”, including a power plant. Trump said Ukraine had also brought up Nato membership.“We’ve been discussing concepts of land because you don’t want to waste time with the ceasefire if it’s not going to mean anything,” Trump said. “So we’re saying: look, this is what you can get, this is what you can’t get. Now we’re going to see if Russia’s there and if not it’s going to be a very disappointing moment for the world.”Asked whether he had any leverage to compel Russia to agree to a ceasefire, Trump said he did but did not want to go into detail.Trump said he could do“things financially that would be very bad for Russia”if a ceasefire was not agreed, but did not elaborate on whether he meantnew sanctions or tariffs.David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, said: “It would be wrong for Putin to lay conditions. Our support for Ukraine, and that of other partners, remains ironclad.”The Russian president hadtravelled to the Kursk regionon Wednesday in a rare battlefield visit, where he spoke with Russian troops who were on the verge of expelling Ukrainian forces from the land it captured last year.“What will happen in the Kursk region? Will an order be given for the troops stationed there to surrender?” Putin asked. “How the situation along the frontline will be resolved remains unclear.”Ukraine has not officially confirmed an organised retreat from the Kursk region but Zelenskyy said on Wednesday that “the military command is doing what it should do – saving the maximum number of lives of our soldiers”.A map of Russian territory gains in KurskOn Thursday, a source in Ukraine’s military who recently left the Kursk region said: “It’s over. The only question now is managing the withdrawal with as few losses as possible.”But although Ukraine appears to be withdrawing from Kursk, Kyiv has largely stabilised the front in eastern Ukraine, where a Russian offensive has stalled in recent weeks.Putin’s remarks came hours after Trump’s envoy and close ally, Steve Witkoff, landed in Moscow, where he is expected to meet Putin to push for a ceasefire after Washington’s talks with Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia.After those talks, Ukraine said it was ready to accept an immediate 30-day ceasefire and the US said it was putting the proposal to Moscow.Recent rhetoric from Russian officials has shown little urgency to reach an agreement or make concessions, as Moscow remains on the offensive on the battlefield.A Kremlin aide, Yuri Ushakov, said he had informed the US national security adviser, Mike Waltz, that Moscow views the proposed 30-day ceasefire as “nothing more than a short reprieve for Ukrainian forces”.0:38Kremlin aide says proposed ceasefire is just 'a temporary respite for Ukraine' – videoRussia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said on Thursday that Moscow was ready to discuss a US-backed peace initiative “as early as today”. But she indicated that Russia saw little urgency in a halt to fighting, reiterating it would not accept western peacekeepers in Ukraine as a security guarantee and that they would be targeted if deployed.Ukraine has said it would need some kind of security guarantee in order to sign a lasting ceasefire deal.Moscow’s continued resistance to European peacekeeping forces – seen by Ukraine as the only viable alternative to Nato membership for guaranteeing its security – presents a big obstacle to a peace acceptable to Kyiv.Observers believe Putin is determined to put forward a string of maximalist demands before agreeing to any ceasefire, which is likely to prolong negotiations.Reuters and Bloomberg have reported that Russia, in discussions with the US, has presented a list of such demands to end the war in Ukraine and reset relations with Washington. The Kremlin spokesperson,Dmitry Peskov, declined to comment on the reports.These demands could include the demilitarisation of Ukraine, an end to western military aid and a commitment to keeping Kyiv out of Nato. Moscow may also push for a ban on foreign troop deployments in Ukraine and international recognition of Putin’s claims to Crimea and the four Ukrainian regions Russia annexed in 2022.Putin could also revisit some of his broader demands from 2021, which go beyond Ukraine, including a call for Nato to halt the deployment of weapons in member states that joined after 1997, when the alliance began expanding into former communist countries.Many in Europe fear these conditions for peace could weaken the west’s ability to increase its military presence and could allow Putin to expand his influence across the continent.Explore more on these topicsRussiaVladimir PutinUkraineEuropeTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

REPRESENTED COUNTRIES.“This will be great for theWineand Champagne businesses in the U.S.,” he added.The US already circumvents the protected geographical origin rules on European products – American supermarkets are full of US-made imitations of champagne and other delicacies such as parmesan and gorgonzola.Senior figures in Europe vowed to hold firm. “We will not give in to threats,” the French foreign trade minister, Laurent Saint-Martin, wrote on X. “Donald Trump is escalating the trade war he chose to unleash.”France was “determined to retaliate” and would “always protect our sectors”, he added.Trump wrote on Thursday: “The U.S. doesn’t have Free Trade. We have “Stupid Trade.” The Entire World is RIPPING US OFF!!!” Channeling the former US president Franklin D Roosevelt, he added: “The only thing you have to fear, is fear itself!”In France, independent winemakers represent 60% of the country’s wine production. They are watching closely to see how the dispute plays out. “We’re very prudent at this stage,” said Jean-Marie Fabre, who makes wine in Fitou in the south of France.French winemakers were concerned they could be swept into the broader tariff row, and had feared tit-for-tat measures when the EU announced retaliatory tariffs on some American products, including US whiskey.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

France’s Cac 40 index gave up morning gains to fall by 0.3%, while Germany’s Dax index fell by 0.6%.Leading European drinks giants came under pressure.

LVMH, owner of Moët & Chandon, slipped 1.4%.In New York, the benchmark S&P 500 dipped 0.7% after Wall Street opened for trading. Trump’s officials have attempted to brush off days of stock market declines, claiming they are not worried about it.“We’re focused on the real economy,” the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said during his latest interview on CNBC news network, a fixture on Wall Street. “I’m not concerned about a little bit of volatility over three weeks.”When asked if he could rule out a recession, vice-president JD Vance said in a Fox News interview yesterday that “you can never predict the future”, but noted that he believes the economy is strong.Trump also repeated a longstanding criticism of the EU, that the trading bloc “was formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States”, calling it “one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the world”.Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the EU’s executive, said on Wednesday that trade between Europe and the US “brought prosperity and security to millions of people, and trade has created millions of jobs on both sides of the Atlantic”.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsFood & drink industryInternational tradeEuropean UnionDonald TrumpEuropeTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The bottle-blond younger sister, with no formal training and a drug addiction that was the fashion industry’s worst kept secret, was seen as a sentimental appointment by a shell-shocked family.She proved everyone wrong. Versace is now defined as much by Donatella as by Gianni. Shesteps down from designingafter 27 years as an icon in her own right, one of the most successful female designers in modern fashion history. Sober for 20 years, she has steered Versace to become a global household name, valued at $2bn (£1.6bn) when it wassold to Capri Holdingssix and a half years ago.View image in fullscreenGianni and Donatella Versace in 1998.Photograph: Paul Schmulbach/ShutterstockVersace found her voice as a designer and as a champion of LGBTQ+ rights. She was praised fortaking a stand against Italy’s anti-gay policiesafter saying in a speech in 2023: “Our government is trying to take away people’s rights to live as they wish.”She looked destined to be consigned to the fashion history books with the untimely death of GianniVersace. But her talent and determination have helped the brand thrive as a living force that still has the power to set trends, and made it potent and desirable to a generation of consumers who have only ever known her as its designer. Gianni recognised and championed her instincts – the safety pin as a Versace motif was an idea she had brought to his atelier – and her fluency with the codes of the house fuelled a growing self-confidence.With an appetite for pop culture, many of Versace’s defining moments, from Jennifer Lopez in a jungle-green dress slashed to the navel in 2019 to a collection co-designed with Dua Lipa in 2023, have happened under her watch. She has been a hands-on presence in the design studio. “Versace is what it is today because of Donatella Versace,” said Emmanuel Gintzburger, the brand’s chief executive, when the succession plan was announced.In private, she is kind and generous, funny and self-aware. When a journalist enquired how old her adored jack russell was during an interview in 2016, she replied: “Audrey is eight – but can you write six?” Her cartoonish image – shellacked walnut skin, platinum hair, petite frame jacked up on spike heels – belies a lack of ego unusual in a star designer.She has always seen herself as the custodian queen of Versace, with a responsibility to keep her brother’s spirit alive. That she is handing her job title to Dario Vitale, a well-respected designer and image maker who has played a major role in the success of Miu Miu,one of the hottest brands in the world, demonstrates her desire to champion the Versace name, not just her own. “I am excited to see Versace through new eyes,” she said in a statement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They said the remaining pollutants would leach into rivers as rains wore down the sediment, threatening human health in a region where river water is widely used to make up for shortages in municipal water supplies.Life returns to Ukrainian reservoir drained by Russian strike on damRead moreThe lead author, Oleksandra Shumilova, said the scale of the environmental impacts was comparable to the Chornobyl nuclear disaster.“All these pollutants that were deposited on the bottom can accumulate in different organisms, pass through the food web, and spread from vegetation to animals to humans,” said Shumilova, a scientist at the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries. “Its consequences can be compared to the effects of radiation.”The researchers linked on-the-ground measurements with remote sensing data and hydrology models to map the environmental impacts of the dam’s destruction, which flooded the region and killed 84 people. They estimated water from the breach killed 20-30% of floodplain rodents, along with the entire juvenile fish stock.They said the reservoir released 9,000-17,000 tonnes of phytoplankton each day in the first week after the dam was blown up, driving an increase in water turbidity that led to the “probable loss” of 10,000 tonnes of macroinvertebrates.The destruction of natural life detailed in the study appears to contrast with thestriking imagesof wildlife that has returned to the reservoir since the dam burst. White willows and black poplars have reforested the land, and wild boars and other animals have taken over areas that people still avoid. Fish that have not been seen for decades, such as sturgeon and herring, have returned to the water.The researchers expect that the area will reach a level of biodiversity equivalent to 80% of an undammed ecosystem within five years.“It’s not recovery, it’s better to use a word such as re-establish,” said Shumilova. “It means that it will develop its own way, but not necessarily to the initial conditions.”The Kakhovka dam, which was built in the 1950s on the Dnipro River, was destroyed on 6 June 2023 while under Russian occupation. Its reservoir supplied water to cool the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and irrigate southernUkraine.1:08Before and after Nova Kakhovka dam collapse in Ukraine – videoUkrainian ecologists have debated whether the dam should be rebuilt after the war – and how much land should be flooded if it is – with some arguing for the new ecosystem to be left alone as part of a growing movement to rewild human-disturbed areas. Shumilova said that the unresolved question of heavy metal contamination complicated this approach, because it was unclear whether the vegetation was enough to keep the exposed sediments in place.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Legal scholars say the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, which Ukraineblameson Russia, and which Russia disputes, could constitute an environmental war crime.Shah Maruf, a law researcher at the University of Dhaka who has published research on the legal consequences of the Kakhovka dam’s destruction, said the new findings “suggest that the damage is ‘widespread, long-term, and severe’, fulfilling one of the key requirements for an environmental war crime”.But he added that the speed of the ecosystem’s recovery could affect the strength of the case. “If the recovery is faster – and if that was anticipated by the perpetrator while attacking – that may compromise the finding of ‘long-term’ damage in the context of environmental war crime.”Last month, a separatestudyexploring the effects of the Kakhovka dam destruction on the Black Sea ecosystems observed some habitats and species replenishing, but found “significant habitat destruction, disturbances and pollutant damages remain”.Carol Stepien, an ecologist at the Smithsonian Institution and co-author of the study, said Ukraine’s freshwater, estuarine and marine species “evolved under conditions of longtime flux”, exposing them to a range of temperatures, salinity levels and habitat qualities. This “may aid their resilience and recovery”, she added.Explore more on these topicsUkraineWaterEuropePollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

An expanded group of far-right and far-left MPs could oppose it in the new Bundestag, a “blocking minority” Merz is keen to avoid.Can Europe defend itself alone? – podcastRead moreAmid expectations that Germany will relax a key element of its strict fiscal rules known as the “debt brake”, its allies have responded favourably and markets have rallied. Economic forecasters have said a public spending boost is likely to help the country emerge from two years of economic doldrums.View image in fullscreenFriedrich Merz speaking in the Bundestag. ‘We have to do something to improve our defensive capabilities, and quickly,’ he said.Photograph: Lisi Niesner/ReutersBut an unusually tense and fractious debate proved on Thursday that the deal is far from being realised, as Merz’s CDU/CSU alliance and his probable future coalition partner, the Social Democrats (SPD), are far from securing the required support of the Greens.In an attempt to win them over Merz offered to expand the scope of defence spending to include civil defence and intelligence spending, as well as allowing up to €50bn for climate protection. He asked the Greens: “What more do you want from us in so short a time?”View image in fullscreenBritta Haßelmann accused Merz of ‘bad manners’.Photograph: Lisi Niesner/ReutersMerz stressed his belief in the urgency of investing in security. “We have to do something to improve our defensive capabilities, and quickly,” he said, describing a “truly worrying security situation in Europe”. Germany must “do something now … Anything else would be irresponsible,” he added.The Greens’ parliamentary co-leader Britta Haßelmann accused Merz of “bad manners”, saying he had not sought a proper, respectful conversation with her party but had instead simply left a message on her voicemail.Before the nearly four-hour debate, the Greens had indicated that negotiations were at a stalemate, with senior figures citing “grave flaws” in the legislation, including the lack of prominence it gave to climate policies.Throughout the debate, Merz was accused of wanting to use the new money to finance projects that would please the new government’s conservativeand SPD voter base, and was repeatedly called on to provide guarantees, including commitments to much-needed reforms, as well as extra cash to renovate hospitals, schools and kindergartens.View image in fullscreenHeidi Reichinnek of Die Linke.Photograph: Liesa Johannssen/ReutersIn a blistering attack, Heidi Reichinnek of Die Linke accused Merz’s conservatives and the SPD of being “undemocratic”, convening the old Bundestag “because you’re dissatisfied with the election results”.Both the far-right Alternative für Deutschland and Die Linke lodged complaints with the constitutional court before the debate, which could deliver its ruling this week.Merz has argued that raising defence spending has become a matter of urgency because of Russia’s invasion ofUkraine, not just for Germany but for the whole of Europe. With Donald Trump in the White House, he has argued, the continent must become more independent.Economists have described Merz’s multibillion-euro package as everything from a “bazooka” to “an extremely risky bet”, while he has called it vital “in light of the threats to our freedom and peace on our continent”.The second and third readings of the government’s plans will take place next Tuesday, before heading to the upper house.Over the coming days Merz will continue to negotiate with the Greens, according to his party officials.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropeFriedrich MerzUkraineRussiaThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

He promised to issue the constitutional declaration to serve as a “legal reference” during the transition period.The Kurdish-led administration in north-eastern Syria sharply criticised the declaration, saying it “contradicts the reality of Syria and its diversity”.Earlier this week, the Syrian Democratic Forces – the Kurdish-led administration’s de facto army –struck a deal with the authorities in Damascus to be integrated into state institutions.But the administration on Thursday said the declaration “does not represent the aspirations of our people” and “undermines efforts to achieve true democracy”.The text of the declaration states: “Calls for division and separatism, requests for foreign intervention, or reliance on foreign powers are criminalised,” without offering specifics.It adds, however, that the government “seeks to coordinate with relevant countries and entities to support the reconstruction process”.A UN spokesperson quoted the special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, as saying he “hopes the [constitutional] declaration can be a solid legal framework for a genuinely credible and inclusive political transition”, adding “proper implementation will be key”.The declaration comes a week after the deadly rash of violence on Syria’s coast, in what analysts described as the gravest threat so far to the transitional process.Mass killings mainly targeted Alawites, resulting in at least 1,476 civilian deaths at the hands of the security forces and their allies, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.Sharaa has vowed to prosecute those behind the bloodshed, and the authorities have announced several arrests.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

This included filming and photographing public stripping, nudity and sexualised abuse and torture, and sharing images online.0:56Footage shows Palestinian men stripped to underwear after detention in Gaza – videoMost perpetrators of sexual and gender-based violence listed in the report were members of the armed forces or working in detention centres, but they also included Israeli settlers targeting Palestinians.The chair of the commission that drew up the report, Navi Pillay, said Israel’s failure to investigate or prosecute abuses created a culture of impunity.Israel last monthsentenceda soldier to seven months for severe assaults of Palestinian detainees, the first conviction for abuse in the detention system. Nine other soldiers were arrested last yearover allegations of sexual abuse so violent it left a detainee in a critical condition, but they have not gone on trial.Pillay said: “The exculpatory statements and actions by Israeli leaders and the lack of effectiveness shown by the military justice system to prosecute cases and convict perpetrators send a clear message to members of the Israeli security forces that they can continue committing such acts without fear of accountability.“In this context, accountability through the international criminal court and national courts, through their domestic law or exercising universal jurisdiction, is essential if the rule of law is to be upheld and victims awarded justice.”The ​UN’s international court of justiceorderedthe Israeli government to ensure its forces did not commit acts of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza in January 2024.Israel is party to the genocide convention, but not the Rome statute under which the international criminal court has jurisdiction to rule on individual criminal cases involving genocide.The UN commission of inquiry also highlighted the “unprecedented scale” of female deaths in Gaza as another gendered aspect of the violence. Israeli attacks have killed more than 48,000 people in Gaza, 33% of them women and girls.That is a higher proportion than during Israel’s past wars in Gaza, caused by “an Israeli strategy of deliberately targeting residential buildings and using heavy explosives in densely populated areas”, the report said.Egypt and Hamas officials on Thursday welcomed comments from Donald Trump that Palestinians would not be forced out of Gaza. “Nobody is expelling any Palestinians from Gaza,” the US president said after a White House meeting with the Irish prime minister, Micheál Martin.Trump has repeatedly called for the US to take ownership of the strip and rebuild it as a “riviera” for the Middle East without its Palestinian residents, suggesting they should move to neighbouring countries including Egypt.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesGenderViolence against women and girlsnewsShareReuse this content"

Following his arrest, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) accused him of leading “activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organisation”.Who is Mahmoud Khalil? The detained Columbia graduate praised as steady negotiatorRead moreThe White House has not specified publicly or in court that Khalil has committed any crime, or how this invalidates his status as a US legal permanent resident. The Trump administration has instead sought to use a provision within immigration law specifying that the secretary of state,Marco Rubio, “has reasonable grounds to believe that your presence or activities in the United States would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States”, according to a charging document provided to Khalil.Andrew Waller, a former British diplomat who worked with Khalil at the UK office for Syria, a diplomatic mission housed inside the British embassy in Beirut, described Khalil as a thoughtful individual and highly valued colleague during his government service.“This is a naked example of the US administration arresting someone for their political opinions, and I think the British government should be exercised about this,” he said.“He is a former British government employee who was vetted and well liked.”Waller added that the British government was entirely dependent on non-British nationals working at embassies worldwide to provide the language skills and local knowledge needed to operate. Khalil worked for years on the British government’s flagship grant programme that brings foreign students to study at UK universities, as well as in a support role for which he helped to inform and shape British foreign policy on Syria through his knowledge and Arabic skills.“The British government relies on people like Mahmoud all over the world,” he said. “Without them the UK could not operate overseas. It could not conduct diplomatic activity without this raft of employees who do this kind of work.”Waller said he was “disappointed” that Khalil’s loyalty to the government he served for years has not been publicly recognised by the UK’sForeign and Commonwealth Development Office. The Foreign Office declined to comment, saying it did not discuss former employees.“There is an element of loyalty here that is really important: If there is one thing Mahmoud showed while working for the British government, it is loyalty,” said Waller.Columbia University did not respond to questions about how the campus administration intends to protect other students like Khalil, after it emerged that he emailed the university begging for legal protection in the days before his arrest.The White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier this week that DHS was “using intelligence” to find other students who took part in campus protests over the Israeli assault on Gaza.A spokesperson for Columbia University referred instead to a statement by the interim president, Katrina Armstrong, earlier this week pledging to “follow the law”, and underlining a “commitment to freedom of speech”.International students at the Columbia journalism school were warned about angering the Trump administration by its dean, Jelani Cobb, and a professor of media law, Stuart Karle,accordingto the New York Times.“Nobody can protect you,” said Cobb, advising them to avoid filling their social media with commentary on the Middle East. Karle reportedly warned the students to avoid coverage of protests of Khalil’s arrest.Both Waller and Khalil’s lawyer, Samah Sisay, pointed to the extensive background checks and screening, including about his political views and those held by his family, that Khalil had been through in order to work for the British government, and then later to obtain a US green card.“It’s completely absurd that US government is saying Mahmoud presents a threat to its foreign policy interests,” said Sisay.“They don’t even say national security interests ... they are not accusing him of specific terrorist or criminal activity, they are just saying a discretionary belief by the secretary of state is enough to deport him.”Khalil was subject to extensive background checks to obtain a green card last year, said Sisay, which granted him legal permanent residency as the spouse of an American citizen.“He would not have been granted it if they truly believed he was a threat. The only difference is a change in the executive, which is incredibly concerning,” she said.Waller described the “rigorous security clearance”, that Khalil was subject to before he began work for the British government at the embassy in Beirut. He oversaw applicants for the prestigious Chevening scholarship, an academic fund for students coming to the UK.Khalil rose up the ranks at the UK office for Syria before deciding to study for a masters degree at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs. Before starting work for the British government, Khalil would have been questioned about his political beliefs, said Waller.“I would say, and I am sure the vetting officers would disagree, that if you’re going to work in a place like Beirut, they take that process a lot more seriously than some other countries,” he said. “Lebanon is a difficult place to work, and they take the security of the embassy there really quite seriously for obvious reasons. So it’s not a box-ticking exercise, it’s a considered process.”US relies on rare foreign policy provision to try to deport Mahmoud KhalilRead moreWaller added that his friend and former colleague was motivated by a desire to help others after his family fled Syria in 2012.“He is a political exile from Syria, who fled the oppressive regime and civil war there. Everything he has done has been driven by a sense of basic humanitarian mission and a sense of justice, to try and help people less fortunate,” he said.The former diplomat also pointed toJD Vance’s comments during a visit by Keir Starmer, when the US vice-president described “infringements to free speech in the UK”.“Given that the US has just reprimanded the UK on freedom of speech extremely publicly, the least the British government could do is to say they are concerned about Mahmoud’s case and the free speech violation it so clearly represents,” said Waller.Explore more on these topicsMahmoud KhalilUS immigrationTrump administrationUS campus protestsForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeUS politicsSyrianewsShareReuse this content"

Satter received his OCI through marriage. The cancellation of his OCI status means he is no longer able to travel to India,where members of his family live.In recent years, the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government, led by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, has been accused ofrevoking OCI privilegesfor those it has deemed critical, part of what Human Rights Watch has called a campaign of “politically motivated repression”.Journalists, academics and activists have been a particular target. Several high-profile journalists have been forced to leave the country after their OCI cards were revoked and academics have been turned away at the Indian border.According to the letter sent to Satter in December 2023, his OCI status was revoked for his alleged “practising [of] journalism without proper permission” and for work that had been “maliciously creating adverse and biased opinion against Indian institutions in the international arena”.Satter, who works in Washington DC, denies ever conducting journalism in India and has only travelled to the country to visit family.The Indian government provided no specifics to Satter’s lawyers on how his journalistic work had been deemed a national security threat to India. However, Satter’s lawyers noted that the cancellation of his OCI came at exactly the same time that a defamation case had been filed against him in India for a story he had written on the Indian cybersecurity company Appin and its co-founder Rajat Khare.Satter’s investigation for Reuters, titled “How an Indian startup hacked the world”, exposed the workings of Appin, alleging it had become “a hack-for-hire powerhouse that stole secrets from executives, politicians, military officials and wealthy elites around the globe”.Rajat Khare’s US representative, the lawfirm Clare Locke, rejected any association between its client and the cyber-mercenary business, telling Reuters that Khare “has never operated or supported, and certainly did not create, any illegal ‘hack for hire’ industry in India or anywhere else”.During the course of his inquiries into Appin and Khare, Satter said that he had received a series of threats made by individuals associated with the company, “one of whom alluded to potential ‘diplomatic action’ unless I abandoned my reporting”.“The petitioner and his employer, Reuters, began receiving threats from individuals linked to a company called Appin, which has hacked organisations in India and abroad,” Satter’s court petition says.On the same day that Satter received the notice of the OCI cancellation, a Delhi judge granted an injunction against the story, forcing it to be temporarily taken down. It was restored 10 months later. Karuna Nundy, the lawyer representing Satter, said the timing clearly “linked” the two events. She emphasised that, under Indian law, defamation is not grounds for OCI cancellation.Khare has been active in pursuing news organisations that have published articles on the activities of Appin. According toan investigation by Reporters Without Borders, at least 15 media outlets investigating Appin received legal notices and five have been subjected to legal proceedings.The New Yorker and the Sunday Times are among those who have faced legal action by entities representing Khare, who also has initiated legal proceedings in Switzerland against a story that mentioned his name. Reporters Without Borders described the magnitude of these gag lawsuits as “unprecedented”.The first court hearing for Satter’s case was heard in Delhi this week. In a statement sent to the Guardian, Satter said the Indian government’s decision to cancel his OCI had “effectively cut me off from members of my family and a country I hold in great affection and respect”.Satter was insistent that the decision was a “mistake or on a misunderstanding” by the ministry of home affairs and that he had only decided to go to court after not receiving any response to his appeal to the government for more than a year.“I am confident that, once the integrity of my journalism is demonstrated before the Indian courts and the true and correct facts are brought to the fore, the ministry of home affairs will see fit to restore my OCI card,” he said. The ministry of home affairs did not respond to requests for comment about Satter’s case.The Indian government now has until the next hearing, on 22 May, to respond to the petition and give legal justification for Satter’s OCI cancellation.The Modi government has cancelled more than 100 OCI cards while in power for the last decade. Among them was thejournalist Aatish Taseer, after he wrote a cover article for Time magazine criticising the prime minister.“The Indian authorities should not be attempting to silence critics by revoking residency rights or other means,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, the deputy director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch. “Instead, the authorities should have the maturity to accept legitimate criticism and work on reforms.”Explore more on these topicsIndiaJournalist safetyNarendra ModiSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The Guardian understands this includes managers.Det Supt Paul Hughes, the senior investigating officer, said: “As our inquiries have continued, the scope of the investigation has now widened to also include gross negligence manslaughter.“This is a separate offence to corporate manslaughter and focuses on the grossly negligent action or inaction of individuals.“It is important to note that this does not impact on the convictions of Lucy Letby for multiple offences of murder and attempted murder.”International experts said last month they had found no medical evidence to support allegations of deliberate harm after reviewing the babies’ medical records on behalf of Letby’s new defence team.TheCriminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates possible miscarriages of justice, is examining the case after receiving the findings of a detailed report by the 14 experts.It has the power to refer a case to the court of appeal if it believes there is a “real possibility” that judges would quash a conviction.Letby, 35, has alreadylost an attemptto challenge her convictions at the court of appeal.Hughes said those identified as suspects had been notified but the force would not confirm their identity or how many were under investigation. No arrests have been made.“Both the corporate manslaughter and gross negligence manslaughter elements of the investigation are continuing and there are no set timescales for these,” he said.Cheshire constabulary said its investigation into the deaths and non-fatal collapses of babies at the neonatal units of the Countess of Chester and the Liverpool women’s hospital between 2012 and 2016 was also continuing.The announcement comes days before Lady Justice Thirlwall, the judge leading thepublic inquiryinto the deaths, is scheduled to hear legal submissions for the inquiry to be paused given the CCRC is now involved.Letby’s new barrister, Mark McDonald, told the Guardian: “The timing of this is of real concern. Is this really an attempt again by the police to control the narrative right before submissions are being made to Thirlwall for it to pause.“Why are they doing this now? Is this another attempt to control the narrative? Particularly when there is substantial expert evidence that points the finger in a different direction.”McDonald said the development raised “serious question marks” about the force’s decision making.Letby was convicted of murdering four of the seven babies by injecting air into their bloodstreams and attempting to kill several others by the same method.She was also convicted of harming two babies by poisoning them with insulin, pumping air into their feeding tube, force-feeding one with milk and causing trauma to the abdomen.The international panel of experts, however, concluded there was “no medical evidence supporting malfeasance causing death or injury” in any of the babies whose cases they examined.It said there were numerous problems in the care of the babies, including a failure to properly carry out “basic medical procedures, delays in their treatment and the misdiagnosis of diseases”.Explore more on these topicsLucy LetbyHospitalsChesterEnglandNursingHealthNHSnewsShareReuse this content"

The choice facing the country’s most vital service was “reform or die – we choose reform”, he said.Beyond that bold rhetoric, however, Starmer and Streeting have – until now – given little in the way of concrete detail about exactly what that plan for reform will entail. The detail will be set out in a 10-year health plan, due in late May, which is being drawn up by Streeting and a coterie of advisers. It will put flesh on the bones of the “three big shifts” in how healthcare is provided that both have promised: from an analogue to a digital service, from care in hospital to community-based care and from treating people’s illness to preventing them from getting sick in the first place.But the biggest, most radical element of the plan is now in the public domain:the abolition of NHS England, which theprime minister announcedin a speech on Thursday about re-engineering the state. The executive body has run the health service in England since its creation in 2012, when it was handed independence from ministerial control and given responsibility for the operation of its 220 trusts, delivering treatment waiting times and making its ever-larger budget fit.Streeting is merging NHS England with his own Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and axing half of its 15,000 staff. The unexpected move amounts to a dramatic and brutal grabbing back of power that every health secretary since Andrew Lansley – whosecontroversial Health and Social Care Act 2012spawned the now-doomed organisation – has wanted to do but never attempted, as Streeting pointedly reminded MPs in his Commons statement on Thursday.By deciding to abolish NHSEnglandoutright, rather than clip its wings, Streeting has marked himself out as the most radical health secretary since Lansley. Siva Anandaciva, the head of policy at the King’s Fund health thinktank, says the move is “a sudden and dramatic revolution in how the NHS is directed and managed. A radical reshaping of how the health service is led will [mean] a seismic shift in power back towards ministers and government departments, who will have more control and direction over how the NHS operates.”The potential advantages to ministers should be less duplication betweenNHSEngland and the DHSC, quicker decision-making and more ministerial oversight of how the NHS operates, he adds.Richard Sloggett, a DHSC special adviser under Matt Hancock, said: “Like many other secretaries of state who have come before him in the post-Lansley era, Streeting has concluded he needs more power to deliver change in the NHS. But unlike those Conservatives who were reluctant to grab too much power, fearing the political fallout, Streeting has concluded that a takeover of NHS England is possible and indeed necessary under aLabourgovernment.”He sees the impending departures of most of NHS England’s senior leaders such as its chief executive, Amanda Pritchard, its medical director, Prof Sir Stephen Powis, and the finance chief, Julian Kelly, as proof of “Streeting’s ‘night of the long knives’”. Given the huge number of dedicated, knowledgable NHS staff who will lose their jobs, it is unsurprising that others have likened the casualty count to blood-letting more reminiscent of ancient Rome or an episode of Game of Thrones.The abolition is also a mystery as well as a surprise. Streeting had previously, explicitly ruled out a reorganisation of the NHS. His planned reform would not need one, he insisted. Indeed, as recently as 30 January he ruled out reorganisation as a costly, complicated and politically challenging waste in an interview with the Health Service Journal (HSJ). “My conclusion at this stage is that I could spend a hell of a lot of time in parliament and a hell of a lot of taxpayers’ money changing some job titles,Tupe-ing over staffand changing some email addresses and not make a single difference to the patient interest.”He assured the HSJ that he would not get into legal scraps. He would simply do more to “eliminate waste and duplication” across the two bodies. Yet he has now embarked on an undeniably massive reorganisation and one which he acknowledged will require legislation. The history of NHS-related legislation does not inspire confidence that the ensuing bill will proceed smoothly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those privy to his thinking say that, behind his respect for the NHS itself and those who have led it in recent years, including Pritchard, he has become convinced that putting ministers back in charge – going back to the pre-2012 model – is the best way to ensure that Labour’s ambitious plans, to “fix” the service the most rely on most, can succeed. He has reached that conclusion after developing “massive frustration” with what he sees as an apparent inability by NHS England’s leadership to make meaningful progress in tackling persistent problems such as taking the pressure off hospitals and GPs by keeping more patients from needing emergency healthcare in the first place by looking after them better at home.Streeting, a driven, impatient character, has been left in “shock” by what he has perceived to be a can’t-do mentality among senior people who, when asked what their plans are to address key challenges, respond by stressing how difficult they are to fix.Starmer has pledged to get treatment waiting times back to where they were under the last Labour government and make the NHS work better in ways that patients notice. Both have to happen by the next general election in 2029, and both are huge tasks. Opinion polls show that nothing matters more to voters than the NHS. That absolute imperative seems to have persuaded Streeting, who needs to visibly turn the NHS’s performance around, to act so decisively, despite the cost and peril involved.Join Wes Streeting in conversation with Pippa Crerar discussing England’s health and social care system and how Labour plans to turn it around on Tuesday 25 March 2025, 7pm-8.15pm (GMT).

The disclosure has already caused frustration among ministers, given its possible repercussions.Blair’s gripe was that the act risked stopping the frank discussions needed among ministers and officials. Ever since, it has become notoriously difficult to have a freedom of information (FoI) request granted, as officials exploit various legal exemptions to refuse them.The successful use of the legislation to probe into Kyle’s AI chatbot use has led some to conclude that a new precedent has been set, one that will have officials across Whitehall sweating over their recent chatbot interactions.‘Dubious’ use of the Freedom of Information Act stopping access to files on Prince Andrew, researchers sayRead more“It’s the first time I’ve come across that information being released, but it’s completely in line with the basic principles of the act,” said Martin Rosenbaum, a former BBC journalist and FoI consultant. “If ministers or officials are doing stuff on their phone or computers which is done for work purposes on behalf of a public authority, that is subject to FoI – whatever device they’re using. The same logic would apply to whatever prompts you type intoChatGPT, or any other AI.”WhatsApp messages and texts – even on personal phones – can already be subject to FoI requests, thanks to a series of fiercely fought cases. In practice, however, officials have become adept at finding ways to knock back or heavily redact responses. Given that attitude, the granting of access to Kyle’s ChatGPT queries has shocked experts.“I’m surprised the department didn’t fight it harder,” said Rosenbaum. “Some departments would have tried to resist it all the way. Obviously, it’s going to prompt a lot of other requests.”Chris Stokel-Walker, the journalist behind the request for Kyle’s ChatGPT use, already has plans to ask for further disclosures. “My jaw dropped – I thought there was no way they’re going to give over this data,” he said. “In the time since I got the response, I have put in other requests for other generative AI interactions.”Given this success, could the act now be used to reveal ministerial Google search requests? Rosenbaum said there was no reason in law stopping such a move. “As journalists, that is a theory we should now test,” said Stokel-Walker.There is still plenty of scope to limit what is revealed, however. Access to Kyle’s ChatGPT queries was initially denied on the basis that some of his prompts were made in a personal capacity. It was later granted when the request was limited to prompts he made in an official capacity. But the difference between personal and official use is a grey area.Heather Brooke, whose use of an FoI requesthelped break the MPs’ expenses scandal, said the distinction could be used to keep information secret. “It does give power of interpretation to people who have an interest in keeping things hidden,” she said. “With MPs’ expenses, some of the most egregious abuses were the exact things that they tried to claim were private.”After this rare victory, Rosenbaum envisages a future in which AI could play an even bigger role in the legislation – becoming both the creator of requests, as well the target of them: “I’m sure FoI requesters themselves will be typing into ChatGPT – what should I request next?”Explore more on these topicsFreedom of informationArtificial intelligence (AI)Peter KyleChatGPTComputinganalysisShareReuse this content"

I feel like she was infatuated with him.”Asked by Gavin Millar KC, for GNM, how she could say Powell had never been uncomfortable away from her own presence, she replied: “I am telling you, she was never uncomfortable around my husband, and even when she was not in my presence I could see she was not uncomfortable, or do I have to be physically beside her?”She also accused Davie Fairbanks, a writer, director and former creative partner of her husband, of lying. Fairbanks’s allegations include claims that Noel Clarke secretly filmed nude auditions and groped an actor at a wrap party.Iris Clarke said Fairbanks had been like a brother to her husband but had been envious of him and deceitful. “He would go around telling people not nice things about my husband to better himself,” she told the court. “He’s a liar … It’s very clear he wanted to target my husband.”She said the former Doctor Who star had tried to help Fairbanks when his friend’s mother had died and with finding a place to live. She told the court she had warned her husband that Fairbanks was manipulative but he was “always with his kind heart trying to help people”.“Noel is a person who is too generous, he’s too caring,” she said.Earlier, completing his evidence on day four in the witness box, Noel Clarke said: “I think the world has changed. I think things that were acceptable 10, 20 years ago are just no longer acceptable and throwing a blanket lens of 2021 on them is just not fair on anybody.”Explore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeGuardian Media GroupThe GuardiannewsShareReuse this content"

It could surely have been managed in a more sympathetic way. Thousands of expert staff will be left wondering what their future holds.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This must not become a distraction from the crucial task that lies ahead: dealing with a historic workforce crisis, bringing down waiting lists and restoring the family doctor.”Three health thinktanks, the King’s Fund, theHealthFoundation and the Nuffield Trust also had reservations about the resources and energy that the changes would take up.Thea Stein, the chief executive of the Nuffield Trust, said removing duplication made sense but “profound problems facing the NHS remain: how to meet growing patient need in the face of spiralling waiting lists, and how to invest in care closer to home with the NHS’s wider finances already underwater and social care reform in the long grass”.“It is not immediately clear that rearranging the locus of the power at the top will make a huge and immediate difference to these issues, which ultimately will be how patients and the public judge the government,” she said.However, sources said Sir Jim Mackey, Amanda Pritchard’s successor as “transitional” NHS England’s chief executive, is expected to be much tougher in demanding that the service improves its performance visibly and quickly.In the Commons, Streeting praised Mackey for his “outstanding track record of turning around NHS organisations, balancing the books, driving up productivity and driving down waiting times”.The health secretary cited Prof Ara Darzi’s verdict in his review of the NHS last autumn that the creation of NHS England in 2012 byAndrew Lansley, then the health secretary, as part of a massive reorganisation under the Tory/Lib Dem coalition, had been “disastrous … a calamity without international precedent”.Join Wes Streeting in conversation with Pippa Crerar discussing England’s health and social care system and how Labour plans to turn it around on Tuesday 25 March 2025, 7pm-8.15pm (GMT).

And it’s not a Labour thing to do … It’s not what they’re for.”Labour MPs have already expressed private concerns that some of the proposed changes go further than Osborne’s cuts under austerity. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Keir Starmer insisted again that his plans did not mean a “return to austerity”.Osborne, who oversaw billions in welfare cuts during his time as chancellor, said he faced strong opposition to freezing Pip. “I didn’t freeze Pip. I thought [it] would not be regarded as very fair. What I did try to do was reform Pip,” he told the podcast.He said his final budget attempt to reform the generosity of Pip payments, including to those who could do some work, was the final straw that led to the resignation of the then work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith.“I had to back down on it. And so it’s all very well saying ‘don’t go for the general freeze, it’s not fair’. However, in politics and often for the Treasury, general freezes have been easier to sell than specific reforms that actually cut in cash terms the payments that certain sections of the disability-claiming community received,” he said.The Guardian understands that under current plans, the bulk of almost £6bn of cuts will come from the Pip, which is not linked to work, and eligibility criteria for the key disability benefit will be tightened, while some payments are expected to be frozen.Speaking on a visit to Hull on Thursday, Starmer said the current system “can’t be defended on economic terms or moral terms”. He said: “We’ve set up a system that basically says: ‘If you try the journey from where you are into work and anything goes wrong, you’ll probably end up in a worse position than when you started.’skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’re also the party of equality and fairness, but we’re not returning to austerity. That’s what I said before the election. That’s what I say now.”Figures from the Department for Work and Pensions on Thursday found the number of people on the highest rate of universal credit with no support to look for work had almost quadrupled since the pandemic. For younger people under 25, that figure had risen 249%, from 46,000 to 160,000, since the pandemic.The department said that while a rise in those categorised as “limited capability for work related activity” was expected as part of the transition to universal credit, it had “surged far beyond projections”.Explore more on these topicsBenefitsDisabilityPublic financeEd BallsGeorge OsborneWelfarenewsShareReuse this content"

He had been absent from Congress as he underwent cancer treatment in recent months.Grijalva’s office said in a statement: “From permanently protecting the Grand Canyon for future generations to strengthening the Affordable Care Act, his proudest moments in Congress have always been guided by community voices.”Another Democratic House member, Sylvester Turner of Texas, died last week from health issues.Grijalva, the son of a Mexican immigrant, was first elected to the House in 2002. Known as a liberal leader, he led the Congressional Progressive Caucus in 2008 and dedicated much of his career to working on environmental causes on the natural resources committee. He stepped down from that position this year, after announcing that he planned to retire rather than run for re-election in 2026.During his time in Congress, Grijalva championed protections for endangered species and wilderness areas, as well as stronger regulations on the oil and natural gas industries. He played a key role in writing the National Landscape Conservation System Act and the Federal Lands Restoration Act, which were passed and signed by Barack Obama.Grijalva had announced in April last year that he had been diagnosed with cancer but would be able to continue his work.

REPRESENTED COUNTRIES.“This will be great for theWineand Champagne businesses in the U.S.,” he added.The US already circumvents the protected geographical origin rules on European products – American supermarkets are full of US-made imitations of champagne and other delicacies such as parmesan and gorgonzola.Senior figures in Europe vowed to hold firm. “We will not give in to threats,” the French foreign trade minister, Laurent Saint-Martin, wrote on X. “Donald Trump is escalating the trade war he chose to unleash.”France was “determined to retaliate” and would “always protect our sectors”, he added.Trump wrote on Thursday: “The U.S. doesn’t have Free Trade. We have “Stupid Trade.” The Entire World is RIPPING US OFF!!!” Channeling the former US president Franklin D Roosevelt, he added: “The only thing you have to fear, is fear itself!”In France, independent winemakers represent 60% of the country’s wine production. They are watching closely to see how the dispute plays out. “We’re very prudent at this stage,” said Jean-Marie Fabre, who makes wine in Fitou in the south of France.French winemakers were concerned they could be swept into the broader tariff row, and had feared tit-for-tat measures when the EU announced retaliatory tariffs on some American products, including US whiskey.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

LVMH, owner of Moët & Chandon, slipped 1.4%.In New York, the benchmark S&P 500 dipped 0.7% after Wall Street opened for trading. Trump’s officials have attempted to brush off days of stock market declines, claiming they are not worried about it.“We’re focused on the real economy,” the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said during his latest interview on CNBC news network, a fixture on Wall Street. “I’m not concerned about a little bit of volatility over three weeks.”When asked if he could rule out a recession, vice-president JD Vance said in a Fox News interview yesterday that “you can never predict the future”, but noted that he believes the economy is strong.Trump also repeated a longstanding criticism of the EU, that the trading bloc “was formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States”, calling it “one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the world”.Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the EU’s executive, said on Wednesday that trade between Europe and the US “brought prosperity and security to millions of people, and trade has created millions of jobs on both sides of the Atlantic”.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsFood & drink industryInternational tradeEuropean UnionDonald TrumpEuropeTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

That sounds a little counterintuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions.“We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad, incident is one too many. We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.”Justine Roberts, the head ofMumsnet, told the BBC’s Today programme that parents could not watch everything their child was doing “24/7”, even if all the parental controls were set and especially if they had several children. She said parents on the forum had spoken of how they struggled to manage their children’s use of Roblox.The US-based company is one of the world’s largest games platforms, with more monthly users than Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation combined. In 2024 the site averaged more than 80 million players a day, and roughly 40% of those were under 13.Players who behave badly can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform. The company is increasingly using more advanced AI systems to flag certain behaviour for investigation.In November last year, under 13s were banned from sending direct messages and also from playing in “hangout experiences”, spaces that feature chat between players.Baszucki said: “We don’t condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you’ll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour.”He added that Roblox used rigorous guidelines and had a “consistent policy” on age ratings, based on the content as well the titles of the games.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The pair’s first company was an education software provider called Knowledge Revolution, but they quickly noticed that children were using the platform to do activities other than homework.Baszucki said: “They wanted to play and build stuff. They were making houses or ships or scenery, and they wanted to jump in, and all of that learning was the germination of Roblox.”As the platform’s popularity grew, the founders noticed players “starting to act out”, prompting them to appoint four people as safety moderators.Despite attracting decent numbers of gamers, it was only when the company launched its digital currency, Robux, a year later that it really started to make money – Roblox is now worth $41bn (£32bn).Players use Robux to buy accessories and unlock content. Content creators now receive 70% of the fee and the store operates on dynamic pricing, meaning popular items cost more.Baszucki said he believed Roblox was “the future of communication” and was now focused on its evolution into a metaverse-style experience where people go about their daily lives in a virtual world, in avatar form, and hoped eventually to attract 10% of the world’s gamers.Explore more on these topicsChild protectionChildrenGamesGame cultureInternet safetyDigital mediaYoung peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

But how does the faux BEC compare?Alaina DemopoulosThu 13 Mar 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 13 Mar 2025 13.20 EDTShareLike a yellow taxi or the pizza rat, the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich has become a symbol ofNew YorkCity. You can find a BEC in just about any bodega, or corner store, where it serves as a cheap, filling breakfast, quick lunch or hangover cure.But withegg prices soaringacross the country due to inflation and theworst avian influenzaoutbreak in history, delis are struggling to keep the price down. It’s been tough since 2022, when the bird flu began, with reports of farmers having to slaughter millions of birds a month. Francisco Marte, a bodega owner in the Bronx and president of the Bodega and Small Business Association,toldNY1 that about 50% of delis had to raise prices on BECs to make a profit.Prices vary across the city, but a few years ago it was easy to find a BEC for $3. Now you’re likely to pay at least $5, with some bodegas charging over $10.One solution, according to two enterprising vegan food companies: try the faux option.As firstreportedin the Daily News, more than 50 New York bodegas rolled out their “Bird Flu Bailout” initiative this week. Dreamed up by Just Egg, a plant-based egg substitute produced by Eat Just, and Plantega, which acts like a deli consultancy, helping bodegas to include more vegan items and encouraging customers to try plant-based alternatives.Just Egg uses mung bean, a member of the legume family, to imitate the texture of light, fluffy eggs. The San Francisco-based startup’s product is available in nearly 50,000 grocery stores across North America, though it’s not that much cheaper than a carton of eggs: one 16oz bottle costs $7.50.View image in fullscreenThe vegan BEC.Photograph: Alaina DemopoulosJosh Tetrick, the CEO of Eat Just, said that bird flu had been a boon to business. “All the major retailers, from big convenience stores to restaurant chains, are reaching out to us now saying, ‘Hey, what’s up with this plant-based egg?’” he said.Though Eat Just’s Silicon Valley headquarters are on the opposite coast to New York’s bodegas, Tetrick believes that a presence in corner stores is key. “Bodegas are a cultural symbol of New York,” he said. “We don’t want to be just a northern California egg. We want to introduce JustEggsto people who think the idea of a plant-based egg is the weirdest thing they’ve ever heard of.”I love and respect all people and believe that vegans should eat their meat and dairy alternatives freely. Still, the idea of Eat Just, a California-based company using the language of venture capitalism to come for bodegas, doesn’t feel great, either. (Plantega is a New York-based company, and its founder, Nil Zacharias, is a lawyer with a background in advertising and technology.) I decided to try a faux BEC at a bodega near my apartment in Brooklyn that offers the Plantega/Just Egg version.I arrived right as the early lunch rush hit, and noticed that my sandwich cost $8, which was just as much as the real thing. That seems to invalidate basically every part of this experiment, but Tetrick says that Just Egg doesn’t control prices at bodegas. According to a “quick survey” from the company, the majority of NYC corner stores sell fake BECs for less than the traditional option. “The ones who go more expensive have just chosen to do that,” he said.The owner of one Upper East Side bodegatoldABC that his vegan options used to be more expensive than the real deal, but that’s changed because of inflation. “It’s cheaper now, because of the price of eggs,” he said. The local outlet New York Groovereportedthat Plantega sandwiches were still “relatively cheaper” than many egg options, with most coming in at about $10 apiece.According to Zacharias’s anecdotal knowledge from working with Plantega bodegas, the average price of a regular BEC tends to be between $4.50 and $6.50. “Within the last month or so, many bodegas are adding upcharges of $1 or $2 for regular sandwiches, so in some areas, the price gap between traditional and plant-based has narrowed.”Right now, however, it seems like it’s still cheaper to get an expensive egg sandwich in most locations than an even more expensive vegan egg one – and the “Bird Flu Bailout” scheme might just be smart marketing, rather than a cheaper alternative.But most experts predict that egg prices couldrise even further, changing those economics. Some bodega owners have used classic NYC creativity to combat rising costs. One in the Bronx garneredheadlineslast month for selling “loosie” eggs, not unlike single cigarettes, to customers who didn’t want to pay for a full carton.When I got my sandwich, I noticed it didn’t have the familiar, comfortable heft of a full-on BEC. I took my first bite and thought, oh, this is cute. It tasted close to the real thing with salty bacon, tangy cheese and soft eggs.I chewed, and chewed, and chewed, because the leather, gummy faux bacon required quite a bit of gnawing. What existed of the cheese – there wasn’t much – lacked the warm, melty consistency that holds a sandwich together. I fear that if I relied on this fake BEC to ease a hangover, I’d be setting myself up for a pretty terrible day.And what about the egg? That was probably the best part of the vegan BEC, if only because it tasted so unremarkable. I just didn’t notice it that much, which is strange, as it took up most of the sandwich.Tetrick says Just Egg’s path to breakfast domination comes from infiltrating local joints, “whether that’s a bodega or a biscuit and gravy restaurant in South Carolina”. And they’re not just going after the do-gooders who are vegan or concerned about the climate. Ninety-one per cent of their customersare not vegan or vegetarian. They’re hoping more traditional egg eaters will try their plant-based alternative as prices continue to rise.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkEggsFoodVegan food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

United came atReal Sociedadrelentlessly, a whir of energy and creativity that is the best advertisement yet for where their head coach might take them.Manchester United v Real Sociedad: Europa League last-16, second leg – liveRead moreBruno Fernandes crowned his and United’s night with a blistering hat-trick strike, running on to Alejandro Garnacho’s pass to blaze into the left corner to send United’s faithful ballistic and secure a quarter-final against Lyon.As the captain said: “This club is all about winning. We have a long way to go, but we are confident that if we focus and have the right mentality we can win games.”By the close, United had two legs versus Lyon – on 10 and 17 April – to navigate and make the semi-finals: they should fancy their chances to go all the way.A Stretford End tifo-scale banner featuring United’s pitchfork-­wielding red devil and an explosion of fireworks heralded kick-off but what followed was the visitors pummelling their hosts in an opening that closed with Imanol Alguacil’s men 1-0 ahead.This was via their leader, Mikel Oyarzabal, claiming and converting a penalty. It was too simple for La Real as Fernandes failed to stop Aritz Elustondo’s low cross from the right, Ayden Heaven’s leg did the same at the near post, and down went Oyarzabal under ­Matthijs de Ligt’s clumsy challenge. The VAR sent Benoît Bastien to the monitor, the spot-kick was awarded. Oyarzabal beat André Onana with ease.United struck back and would dominate the rest of the tie. Fernandes initiated the scoring move, aiming a ball for Rasmus Højlund, the striker was impeded from addressing due to Igor Zubeldia’s shove. ­Bastien awarded a second penalty and a Fernandes hop-and-skip prefaced a coolly-taken equaliser that went to Alex Remiro’s right, the keeper diving the other way.View image in fullscreenReal Sociedad’s Jon Aramburu (no 19) and his teammates are left dumbfounded after his red card.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersSuddenly, United were the ­buccaneering force via a ­muscular pace that exhilarated and pleased their head coach. Percussive passes were exchanged, players were pictures of motion and fluidity.One sequence featured Fernandes ­tapping to Joshua Zirkzee, who passed to a Patrick Dorgu stampeding down the left. The wingback dinked over the ball, it reached Garnacho, and his shot was stymied.As piercing, a little after, was the balletic Zirkzee footwork that allowed him to find Højlund whose flick narrowly missed.The latter was joined in the starting XI by Onana and Casemiro, a trio who, according to Sir Jim Ratcliffe, form a not-so fabulous three, the owner referencing them this week as part of a band of squad members who are “overpaid and not good enough”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another from the latter ensued when Dorgu broke through the inside-left channel: the Dane, overlapping, screamed to be fed but Dorgu decided to fire and the ball dribbled tamely into Remiro’s hands. Dorgu, earlier, hit a volley straight from a corner: it missed, too, rippling the roof of the net, but here was more of the inventive play that has been missing for an age from this team.With the contest at 2-2 overall, the second half could be billed as 45 minutes to save United’s bid for silverware. They had the very best start. A raid ended with Zirkzee letting fly, Remiro palming the ball into Dorgu’s path and Elustondo, illegally, ­stopping the Dane’s run. A third penalty was given and Fernandes netted his second, this time aiming to Remiro’s left, the ­keeper guessing – again – the wrong side.Cue rapture from the congregation who were witnessing the most complete performance under Amorim. Dorgu, too, was showing why the Portuguese signed him in the winter window, a next offering a scything burst down the left and pass over that would have been a toe-in for Højlund but for Remiro’s intervention.United were bright and aggressive as Garnacho proved by sprinting to intercept a ball near goal, Remiro, whose loose pass it was, saving his blushes by clutching the cross. In a central zone, he fed Zirkzee who relayed to the excellent Højlund and he ­rampaged in, an effort missing marginally to his right.Zirkzee and Dorgu were among United’s standouts and the two combined to have Jon Aramburu sent off. The first’s curving pass had the second cutting across the substitute who bundled him down and, as the last man, the busy Bastien had to issue the red card.Real Sociedad were stunned. Now came Fernandes’s box-office finish plus a late Diogo Dalot bonus, Dorgu decorating his outing by insisting he should not be awarded a penalty when colliding with Hamari Traoré.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueManchester UnitedReal Sociedadmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Spurs manager had been hoping that someone would step up to save their season and his salvation arrived in the shape of Wilson Odobert, with a little bit of help from James Maddison.When the England midfielder made it 2-0 early in the second half to add to Odobert’s well-taken first goal for the club, it looked like Postecoglou’s side were cruising to a last-eight showdown with Eintracht Frankfurt. This being Tottenham, however, things are never that simple and a mistake from Odobert allowed Peer Koopmeiners to level the scores on aggregate with 20 minutes to play to leave the home crowd fearing the worst. But Odobert kept Postecoglou’s hopes of ending the season with some silverware alive – and perhaps even saved his job – when the Frenchman swept home at the end of a flowing move instigated by Maddison to send Spurs into the quarter-finals of theEuropa Leaguefor the first time since 2013.Tottenham v AZ: Europa League last-16, second leg – live (plus Rangers and Chelsea updates!)Read more“We made it more nervy than we needed to,” admitted Postecoglou. “It was a big night for us and I couldn’t be happier with the way the players handled it. We looked strong, we looked dominant and threatening in the final third – all the things we want to be.”Postecoglou had promised to provide the home supporters with “something to get behind” in his programme notes after his side’s disappointing display in last week’s first-leg defeat in the Netherlands. They duly responded with a much-improved performance that was typified by the captain Son Heung-min, who was embraced by a bear hug from his manager at the full-time whistle in joyous scenes. Many have questioned whether Son, at 32, can still deliver on the biggest stage after a difficult season but he was instrumental in Odobert’s winner having covered every blade of grass for the cause.Lucas Bergvall – tasked with playing the holding role in midfield ahead of Yves Bissouma after Rodrigo Bentancur’s suspension – also impressed before he was taken off with a suspected injury five minutes from full time. But the return of Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven – who hadn’t started a game together since 8 December against Chelsea when both picked up injuries that have severely disrupted Tottenham’s season – at last gave Postecoglou the security he has been missing at the back. It was no coincidence that they conceded minutes after Van de Ven was replaced by Archie Gray on the hour mark in what looked like a pre-planned move. “That disrupted us a bit,” admitted Postecoglou.Ajax’s elimination against Eintracht earlier in the evening meant that AZ were the last Dutch side left in European competition when the game kicked off, although they had never won an away match against English opposition in 10 previous attempts. They defended well for more than 25 minutes but that all changed when Wouter Goes found himself under pressure from Son on the edge of his own area. Son’s block ricocheted into Dominic Solanke’s path and he showed great awareness to tee up Odobert for a curling finish that belied the fact that his last goal came for Burnley in a 4-1 victory over Luton in August. Postecoglou pumped his fist in celebration in a rare show of emotion.View image in fullscreenJames Maddison scores Tottenham’s second goal during the 3-1 win against AZ Alkmaar.Photograph: Ian Walton/APAZ were finding it much more difficult to penetrate the Tottenham defence than in the first leg but there was a reminder of the hosts’ tendency to shoot themselves in the foot when they gifted possession to Zico Buurmeester on the edge of their area and he dragged his shot wide of Guglielmo Vicario’s post.The Tottenham goalkeeper had another lucky escape at the start of the second half when he had to perform a Cruyff turn inside his own area to elude Troy Parrott after taking too long on the ball. But the home crowd’s nerves turned to delight when Pedro Porro won possession to feed Son and he exchanged passes with Maddison, who finished with aplomb. This time, Postecoglou raised two arms in the air to celebrate, although his heart must have been in his mouth when Romero blocked Parrott’s goalbound shot moments later.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But disaster struck within three minutes after he had departed when Odobert appeared to have won back possession, only to divert the ball into the path of Koopmeiners via a touch from Bergvall and the AZ midfielder could barely believe his luck as he slammed the ball past Vicario.Suddenly the visitors looked like they believed it could be their night, although Maddison and Odobert had other ideas. A last-ditch goalline clearance from Bissouma in injury-time drew one of the biggest roars of the evening as a relieved Postecoglou can start planning for their next challenge.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueTottenham HotspurAZ Alkmaarmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It’s as if someone took a wrong turn. Cowboy hats and helmets, saddles and ski boots, belt buckles and snowsuits – those two types of gear aren’t usually cut from the same cloth. But this weekend in the midwest, at this year’s Extreme Skijoring event, they go together like “Minnesota” and “nice”.The sun is beating down on the snow-covered track at Canterbury Park, 25 minutes from downtown Minneapolis, where fur and fringe fill the stands and old-school country blares from the speakers. It’s noon, but people are already taking shotskis. There’s a bison named Kidd Buffalo off in the distance, and the American flag beats against the wind.There’s no doubt about it, we’re in cowboy country now.After an opening ceremony, prayer and the national anthem, it’s off to the races. At about 40mph, horse and rider fly down the snow-packed track while a skier or snowboarder holds on to a 30ft long rope attached to the saddle 8 to 10ft behind the horse. Thecoursesinclude 6ft tall jumps and obstacles where the skier grabs plastic rings with their arm, all while maintaining balance, speed and the grip of the tow rope. Skiers fall, others crawl over the finish line, but most catch air.In about 20 seconds, the entire run is finished.View image in fullscreenA rider and skier compete at the Extreme Skijoring event at Canterbury Park in Shakopee, Minnesota in February.Skijoring, orskikjøringin Norwegian, means “ski driving”, and it originated in Scandinavia, where reindeer pulled skiers for transportation.Competitive skijoring first started in the Nordic Games in Sweden in 1901, and by 1949 a slower carnival event version was introduced to the United States in Colorado.Today, the western US largely dominates the sport. Each year, the Skijoring World Championship is held in Whitefish, Montana, and dozens of races happen in Colorado, Idaho, Wyoming and Utah. Abroad, Switzerland, France, Poland, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia all have their hand in the sport, too.It was once an exhibition sport in the Olympics, but it’s mostly a thrill sport for the people involved. The top teams receive prize money and rodeo belt buckles.side by side pictures of a person carrying ropes and a man on a horse wearing fringed chapsLeft: Towing ropes are prepared for the skijoring races at the Extreme Skijoring event at Canterbury Park. Right: A rider gallops down the track during a race.In the midwest, equine skijoring is less common, with skijorers harnessing themselves to one or several dogs instead. Oftentimes, people skijor on cross-country trails with their personal pup for an outing and not a competition.But in good northern fashion, Minnesotans always find a way back to their Scandinavian roots. In 2018, Ted Slathar from Extreme Events MN introduced the skijoring event to the region at Canterbury, and the rest is history.Slathar’s daughter Rachel has been skijoring since she was 13. She has long since lost her midwestern accent, carrying a western drawl while she pulls her chaps over her jeans and introduces us to her horses.Six years ago, at just 17, she started her own business,Daisy If You Do Co, a western wear company. She says she took a wrong turn in Amarillo, Texas, and “caught the first ride out of there” to Stillwater, Oklahoma, where she says she found God.Slathar teams up with the snowboarder Benton Obregon, who race under the name “the Winning Team”. Obregon, a native Minnesotan, now lives in Bismarck, North Dakota. The pair travel back to their home state together every year to compete in the event.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenAbove: Rider Rachel Slather of Stillwater, Oklahoma, chats with a friend as she prepares for the opening ceremonies at the Extreme Skijoring event. Below: Snowboarder Nathan Obregon flies through the air after taking a jump during the freestyle race.“Trust and chemistry are everything in skijoring,” he says. “Rachel and I have been partners since the beginning, and her skill as a rider makes my job easier. While we can’t exactly talk during runs, our practice sessions help us fine-tune everything from timing to path selection.”There’s a lot of magic that happens between the rope and the skier. It’s no easy feat. Holding the tow rope is an art in its own right, plus the added athleticism need to stay upright on their skis. During the run, the rope will travel up, down and through the skier’s hands. They’ll hold it with one hand, turn it taut, and let it rip.Obregon began snowboarding when he was five years old. By eight, he was competing in regional events. This will be his seventh year competing with Slathar at Canterbury Park.The skijoring event is scheduled by different categories: youth, novice, snowboard, freestyle and open. Race winners are determined by the fastest time and attaining all of the rings. If a ring is missed or dropped, the team gets a 2-second penalty added per ring. Winners in freestyle, which is when a skier gets towed into a jump and lets go of the rope to do a trick, are judged on style, difficulty and overall impression.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenAbove: A skier is towed by his teammate at the Extreme Skijoring event. Below: A line of snowboarders and skiers enter the track for the opening ceremonies.As a team, Slathar and Obregonare racing champions and have earned titles in freestyle. “We even have a claim on throwing the first double backflip in competitive skijoring,” says Obregon.Nick Franta, a skier from the small town of LaCrescent, Minnesota, says: “Being able to rely on my rider to keep the pace up on the straights and make minor adjustments during the run is key to success. As the skier, the rider needs to be able to depend on me to make adjustments on the fly depending on how fast he and the horse are going, not to mention holding on and not falling.”And fall, they do.The crowd roars with “oohs” and “aahs” as skiers and snowboarders land on their backs or lose the rope, tumbling toward the snow. Last year, someone broke both of their arms.side by side pictures of a woman riding a horse towing a man in a colourful skisuit on skis behind her, and of spectators wearing colourful hatsLeft: A rider and skier team after successfully completing a jump. Right: Cowboy hats are a costume staple for many of the competitors and attendees at the event.Franta, sporting chaps with a turquoise design, and his teammate, Spencer Sansevere, made their skijoring debut in 2023. “Since I have been skiing for over 20 years and Spencer has been riding since before he could walk, we thought we would make a pretty good team,” says Franta.Last year they placed second in the novice division. This year, the competition is more intense as they participate in the open division.Franta says: “Ever since I can remember, the streams and bluffs of the Driftless region have provided me with endless outdoor activities.” But, he says, the midwest “hasn’t caught on to how much fun skijoring is” just yet.Whether more areas in the region pick up equine skijoring or not, Franta says: “You will definitely find me competing in skijoring as long as I have a horse and rider to pull me.”Obregon echoes this sentiment. He says the uniqueness of skijoring keeps him coming back, despite his retirement from snowboarding as a professional career last year.He says that the event is special to the region. “I’m grateful to be part of it. Seeing the sport grow in the midwest, especially here in Minnesota, is exciting.”View image in fullscreenA rider and skier team compete.Explore more on these topicsExtreme sportsSkiingSnowboardingMinnesotaHorsesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

IT HAS NOW BEEN …0… DAYS SINCE THE LAST VAR CONTROVERSY.The second leg ofa scintillating Madrid derbyin the Champions League round of 16 went to penalties on Wednesday, sending Real through over Atlético. Antonio Rüdiger hit the winning spot kick, but the shootout truly turned on an especially eagle-eyed call by the video assistant referee.On Atlético’s second spot kick, Julián Alvarez’s plant foot slipped, grazing the ball ever so slightly before he swept his shot past Thibaut Courtois with his other boot. The contact was all but imperceptible even with the benefit of an endless stream of replays, zooms and alternate angles shared in the minutes and hours afterwards. Yet the VAR intervened so quickly and decisively that CBS’s referee analyst, Christina Unkel, speculated that ball sensor technology must have been used to determine that contact had taken place (Uefa later clarified that it had not; the call was made solely with video evidence). Alvarez was deemed to have touched the ball twice and his penalty was disallowed, ultimately helping eliminate his beleaguered club.Atlético Madrid’s torment goes on – Real are the nightmare they can’t wake up from | Sid LoweRead moreThe issue is not so much the correctness of the call – the contact was near-microscopic, but it did happen – it’s the aggressive way in which VAR was used at all. Referee Szymon Marciniak didn’t appear to have spotted the infraction, despite standing just a few feet away and staring right at the ball when it was struck. As such, he had hardly committed a “clear and obvious error”as Uefa defines the burden of prooffor the use of VAR in the Champions League. That will be scant consolation to Atlético, who saw a Champions League campaign ended by cross-town rivals Real for a sixth time in six European meetings.This is the nature of soccer in the age of VAR. What was heralded as a way to quell controversy has instead, added layers of exactly that.VAR incidents are now so endemic that Norway’s clubs were compelled to vote on whether use of the technology should be scrapped two weeks ago. Ultimately, they decided tostick with VAR, even though most of the country’s professional clubs want rid of it.In the Norwegian league, the use of VAR has become so unpopular that fans felt they had no choice but topelt the field with fishcakesin protest, which may or may not be A Norwegian Thing. (If it isn’t, please don’t tell me. It’s preferable to live in the illusion that there is a Nordic nation out there that registers its umbrage through airborne fish delicacies.)Ultimately, the decision on whether to keep or scrap VAR devolved into a power struggle of a sort between Norway’s 32 top professional clubs and the federation. Whereas the vote to introduce VAR – which Norway didn’t adopt until 2023, years later than most European countries – was conducted by those pro teams alone, the decision to scrap it was voted on by every club in the country. Several amateur clubstold the Guardianthey felt conflicted about being dragged into a fight about a technology not in use at their level. Had it been left up to the pros, VAR would have been scrapped, by a 19-13 margin. Instead, the federation orchestrated a vote among all the country’s clubs to force the retention of VAR – and avoid becoming the first nation to scrap it – prevailing by 321 votes to 129.Next door, Sweden remains a holdout in never introducing VAR in the first place. But the Swedes, Norway’s fellow travelers in techno-skepticism, don’t think of themselves as luddite outliers. “We are a leader,” the chief executive of Swedish club Malmötold the Independentlast year.Perhaps they are. When England’s Football Supporters’ Association polled its members on the introduction of VAR before it actually came to the Premier League in 2019,almost three-quarterswere in favor. When it asked them again in 2023, almost two-thirds opposed it. Last summer, Wolverhampton Wanderers went so far as tocall for a vote among Premier League teamsto abolish VAR – no other clubs voted with Wolves.The reason VAR remains in dispute in some leagues, and unloved in most, is that it implicitly promised to do something that it couldn’t achieve: eliminate human error.A year ago, the Premier League’s chief football officerclaimedthat VAR had helped referees make the correct decision 96% of the time, up from 82% in the pre-VAR era. Even if you take that number on its face, the rub is in that last 4%. In the first half of the 2024-25 EPL season, VAR made 10 errors – by either missing an “intervention” or simply getting it wrong –as totted by up ESPN. While the mistakes were cut down by half year-over-year, misapplications or miscommunications in VAR, or outright errors, are still so common that they dominate the discourse on many Premier League matchdays.The incurable issue with VAR is that it was framed in the wrong way upon its introduction. Or rather, it wasn’t framed at all. If it had been presented by the leagues and various bodies that adopted it as a tool for referees to getfewercalls wrong, a tolerance for mistakes might have been baked into the recipe. If it had been sold as a way to correct only the biggest, most obvious missed calls (thinkThierry Henry v Ireland), there would be a different level of expectation among everyone about how often it would be used.But it wasn’t introduced with those caveats. Success was never really defined. In this vacuum, it was broadly assumed that there would be no more bad calls. Fans figured that the total avoidance of mistakes would be beneficial – or better fortheirteam, at any rate, convinced as many fans are that they are the victim of conspiracies.Though the accuracy of refereeing may have gone up, the attendant costs to the game’s flow and the emotion of scoring goals feel to many like they don’t justify the price of admission. Goals, the whole objective of the sport, are guilty until proven innocent by VAR validation. Based on the ending of Real v Atlético, so are spot kicks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAnd goals are the very reason why the Swedes have resisted VAR. “When a goal is scored, you let the feelings go, you don’t have to wait for a decision at a later stage,” Malmö CEO Niclas Carlnentold the Independent. “Of course, that means you have to accept that the decision is not always right. In Sweden we have prioritized the feelings and the explosion that you have inside stadiums when you score.”The frothing scrutiny of referees, meanwhile,has hardly abatedfor their being given better equipment.Whether the game realizes it or not, modern football has been living through a case study on whether fairer sport actually makes for better sport. And if the often marginal and sometimes inequitable gains in fairness yielded by VAR – some MLS stadiums have more TV cameras available for VAR use than others, for instance – justify the damage to the sport’s cadence.It’s certainly done nothing to stop the metastasizing of aparanoid stylewithin the sport’sbroader grievance culture. These are symptoms of our time writ large, perhaps, when the onlybroad, global consensuslies in a desire to smash the status quo.The difficulty of applying the rules accurately and correctly in a sport that only ever moves faster while the eyesight and judgment of the refs stays the same, has not been resolved. It has merely been deflected, slightly, from the refs on the field to some other refs near the field, or in a booth somewhere.Elite sport is, at heart, a dance of skill and savvy and physique and, yes, mistakes. By automating the trickiest parts of a referee’s job, the notion that match officials are also entitled to human error has sloughed off. By giving a few people on the field a chance at a do-over, the leeway to get any little thing wrong – even the faintest touch of a ball at the wrong time – vanished.Maybe things were better before. Many think so in Norway. And inSweden. And probably in the Atlético half of Madrid. If you go by public sentiment, in other places, too. That’s the trouble with VAR: it didn’t solve a problem. Not entirely. Or even close to it. It merely dulled one issue and presented a few new ones. And so the discussion over its merits can’t be resolved either.Leander Schaerlaeckens is at work on a book about the United States men’s national soccer team, out in 2026.

Fortune definitely favoured the team for whom luck is a constant companion.Real squeaked through on penaltiesagainst Atlético, but the new Galácticos resembled less a team than a disparate group of sulking prima donnas. Jude Bellingham was dishing out rollickings to his teammates when his own performance was below par. Vinícius Jr’s penalty miss was so bad it will probably cost him this year’s Ballon D’Or. As normal time and extra-time ticked on, it was Real rather than Atlético who reached for the dark arts: Brahim Diaz threw himself to the ground in search of a penalty. Then came the shootout, and the video-assisted decision that Atlético’s Julián Alvarezhad double-touched his kick, ruling it out. The decision, rather less than clear-cut, was awarded quicker than regular offside calls are decided from the video booth. It appeared the type of ruling Real Madrid usually get when others are left disappointed. They roll on, having found a novel way to win. It’s the Real Madrid way.Paris Saint-GermainOver the two legs with Liverpool, PSG were the far better team. PSGprevailed on penalties at Anfield, and only the two remaining Spanish giants are more favoured to win the trophy that has eluded the Parisians. Ousmane Dembélé and Bradley Barcola have been converted by Luis Enrique from unreliables to two of the best attacking players in Europe. Vitinha pulled the midfield strings at Anfield – not bad for someone who once failed to make the grade at Wolves. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, their January signing, is a delight, a throwback dribbler with thoroughly modern muscle. PSG’s travelling ultras filled the Anfield night air, their team echoing that confidence once a first-half storm had been ridden out after Dembélé’s goal. In the shootout, that confidence was repeated.Aston VillaThere are two Aston Villas in circulation. One of them, in the Premier League, is grinding the gears to return to European football. The other has graced theChampions League. Over two legs a revenge mission on Club Brugge, who had beaten Villa in the group stage, was completed with surgical precision. A 3-0 victory at Villa Park made it a 6-1 aggregate win, and set up the chance for more vengeance. Next up are PSG. Villa manager Unai Emery was jettisoned by PSG as he was perceived to lack the personality to take on such a big club. While Villa are no minnow, the club have proved to be the right size for Emery’s alchemy and obsessive coaching to take root. And, in Europe, those Villa fans are having their best time in more than 40 years.Going outAtlético MadridAtlético hearts will have sunk when Real were drawn from the pot but they let a golden chance slip by. After taking the lead through Conor Gallagher on Wednesday, it was Diego Simeone’s team who had the tie by the throat. A lack of quality in attack was costly, and Real proved just as adept at the spoiling tactics Simeone’s team are known for. The rashness of Clément Lenglet’s foul on a previously anonymous Kylian Mbappé did not result in a goal as Vinícius shanked his penalty, but they will rue Ángel Correa’s late miss. The penalty shootout – from that Alvarez decision to Marcos Llorente’s woodwork clank to Jan Oblak’s fumble of Antonio Rüdiger’s decisive kick – spoke of an Atlético team unable to overturn the weight of history. They are still yet to get the better of their aristocratic neighbours in this competition.Atlético Madrid’s torment goes on – Real are the nightmare they can’t wake up from | Sid LoweRead moreLiverpoolThe 36-team group-stage winners exiting in the last 16 may lead some to question the expanded competition’s structure. Arne Slot’s first Liverpool season has been an unexpected success, one likely to result in a Premier League title – and beyond Sunday’s Carabao Cup final, the rest of the season will now resemble a victory lap. One tinged with disappointment? Perhaps, though there was evidence of where a rebuild will take place. Darwin Núñez’s tears following his penalty miss suggested a last chance squandered. Virgil van Dijk showed far less than his usual assurance and was then pictured in conversation with PSG officials,his contract still unsigned. That was explained – unconvincingly – as as an apology for previous behaviour. Still, at least Slot enjoyed it. “It was the best game of football I have ever been involved in,” said the Dutchman, now left to bemoan “small margins” and plan for next season.LilleIf anyone let an opportunity slide by in the last 16, it was the French club. Instead, Borussia Dortmund were allowed to use the competition as their haven from continued Bundesliga pain. The first leg in Westphalia had ended in a 1-1 draw, so when Jonathan David opened the scoring on Wednesday a quarter-final meeting withBarcelonafor Lille looked on. Lille’s Lucas Chevalier delivered a series of brilliant saves, but Thomas Meunier’s push on a rampaging Serhou Guirassy swung the tie. Chevalier failed to read Emre Can’s penalty and had no chance with Maximilian Beier’s winner, either. Lille return, with regret, to Ligue 1’s battle to play in this competition next season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the second leg shootout, the Italian giant reminded us of his candidacy. When it comes to penalties, no one compares. That made it six of the seven penalty shootouts he has taken part in for club and country that Donnarumma has decided, making 24 saves from 103 penalties. Having dashed back to the dressing room after extra-time, he returned with a point to prove. “I see a lot of criticism from journalists, if you can call them that, without knowing what the goalkeeper’s job is,” he said.Lamine Yamal, BarcelonaIf Vinícius Jr blew his chances of the “Ballon d’Or, Ballon d’Or, Ballon d’Ot”, as Rio Ferdinand styled it, then how long until Barcelona’s jewel wins the prize? Lamine Yamal won’t be 18 until July but the Euro 2024 winner plays with the assurance of a veteran. His linkup play with Raphinha cut Benfica to shreds. He set up the first goal for the Brazilian then scored his own beauty, cutting in from the right and curling the ball in with his left foot. His talents seem limitless. He’s already close to the franchise player of the type Barcelona built their empire on.Marco Asensio, Aston VillaA second successive nomination for perhaps the most transformative signing of the transfer window just gone. The depth of Asensio’s impact since arriving on loan from PSG can be shown by deduction. He didn’t play for against Brentford at the weekend, and Villa were bereft of his eye for a key pass. And goal, too. He was clinical against Brugge, scoring twice. His first was a rising shot, scored in front of the Holte End that now idolises him. The second reflected a growing understanding with Marcus Rashford, who is showing signs of revival at Villa. Though PSG are Villa’s next opponents, Asensio is still eligible to face his parent club. Uefa sets different rules to the Premier League that “strictly forbid any club to exert, or attempt to exert, any influence whatsoever over the players that another club may (or may not) field in a match”. PSG may rue that.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueReal MadridParis Saint-GermainAston VillaLiverpoolLilleAtlético MadridfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It finally ended with Barry Ferguson’s players bouncing up and down in front of the Copland Road stand while José Mourinho, who had worn a face as ashen as his all-grey outfit asFenerbahcefluffed their lines from the spot, led his to perform mea culpas 100 metres away. The night had swung in multiple directions but, over their week’s work, Rangers deserved their shot at toppling Athletic Bilbao in the last eight.Mourinho could only watch as Fenerbahce, having levelled the tie up and brought on the cavalry, failed to putRangersaway in the final 50 minutes. He would surely have expected more from Dusan Tadic and Fred, both of whom saw Jack Butland make tremendous saves, in the shoot-out; when Mert Hakan Yandas spooned the final penalty over it was party time for the home support, a miss from Ianis Hagi amongst it all rendered entirely irrelevant.Tottenham and Rangers reach Europa League quarter-finals – as it happenedRead moreRangers, full of willing and energy but lacking the quality that would eliminate drama, can take credit for maintaining a threat even while wobbling terribly. They had Fenerbahce, who had not seemed capable of matching their intensity for most of the first half, where they wanted them until Sebastian Szymanski scored a superb opener before the teams went in. Fenerbahce are patently a team of moments and found another when Szymanski squeezed in their leveller but Rangers were never quite hanging on for dear life.They did, however, frequently live with hearts in their mouths. That was never more so than the moment when Yandas went down in the box under Nico Raskin’s challenge three minutes from the end of extra time. Fenerbahce screamed blue murder; an apoplectic Mourinho, who had pounded the technical area threadbare all evening, frantically mimed a VAR screen but his only reward was a yellow card and the penalty would soon get worse.The episode naturally provided ample post-match ammunition. Fenerbahce had seen other spot kick appeals turned down, including a Filip Kostic shout for handball against Ridvan Yilmaz. “If you don’t get three [penalties], you get two,” Mourinho said. “If you don’t get two, you get one. If you don’t get one, it’s strange.” The subsequent rabbit hole of conspiracy included the latest dangling of his Roma side’sEuropa Leaguefinal defeat to Sevilla in 2023, which brought him a four-game ban, as a possible reason for Fenerbahce’s perceived ill treatment.Regardless, Mourinho was laying it on thickly when he claimed Fenerbahce were the only deserving cause on show. They had started the match slowly, strutting around in comparison to a Rangers side in which Vaclav Cerny was again an indefatigable, bustling force. Cerny, who let pot shots fly all night and worked the keeper Irfan Egribayat more than once, would later convert impressively from the spot. But Szymanski’s hooked volley was a lifeline and Fenerbahce found it in themselves to probe extensively after the interval.View image in fullscreenFenerbahce’s Sebastian Szymanski scores their spectacular first goal.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersEventually they equalised when Szymanski converted Mert Müldür’s low centre. Ibrox was a skittish, worried place by that point. Mourinho deployed the cavalry in the forms of Tadic and Edin Dzeko; Rangers were alarmingly loose but survived the rocky road to extra time and it is to Ferguson’s huge credit that they gathered breath for a fresh push thereafter.“They’re digging deep for me and that’s all I ask of them,” he said of his team afterwards. That was in no doubt, James Tavernier snuffing out a clear chance at one end and forcing a flying stop from Egribayat with a free-kick at the other.

For all the agonies that led them here, Rangers evidently enjoyed winning in this fashion too.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueRangersFenerbahcematch reportsShareReuse this content"

Unai Emery is a former PSG manager, Marco Asensio is on loan from the Ligue 1 club, but McGinn’s ties are more modest, if not tenuous.“The only place I’ve been there is the shop,” he says, smiling. “We were in a big campervan and stopped off in Paris. I think I was about seven or eight … I remember getting a PSG strip.”Aston Villa earn shot at greatness after setting up historic PSG showdown | Jonathan WilsonRead moreNext stop, Paris, in the Champions League quarter-finals. It has been quite the adventure: memorable trips toYoung Boys,Leipzig,Monaco, two to Brugge, and McGinn says the ride can continue.PSG defeated Liverpoolover two absorbing legs in the last 16, prevailing on penalties, and the Villa captain, while acknowledging their prowess, is predicting another close tie.“It’s going to be a tighter game than a lot of people realise and we’ll certainly give everything we have to get through,” he says. “We’ve shown over the years, especially at Villa Park that we can compete against the best in the world, whether that’s Man City or Liverpool in full flow. PSG have got a lot in their armoury which can hurt us, but we have a lot in ours that can hurt them.”October’s victory over Bayern Munich, another European superpower, will be hard to eclipse but the claret-and-blue convoys who will cross the Channel have grown used to supposed ceilings being shattered of late. “Whether they get on the ferry, get in their cars, there will be plenty of Aston Villa fans over there,” McGinn says.“We all deserve it. Why not dare to dream? We can carry this journey on. You never, never know – stranger things have happened. We know we’re capable of playing against the best, competing against the best and I’m sure every team that comes up against us will know they’re in for a game.”View image in fullscreenMarco Asensio has scored seven goals in his past five matches, including two against Club Brugge, and is free to face his parent club, PSG in the Champions League.Photograph: Manjit Narotra/ProSports/ShutterstockThere is no shortage of belief. Not under Emery, a coach besotted with European competition; not with the superstar loanees Asensio and Marcus Rashford making a splash. Asensio has scored seven goals in his past five matches, including another doublein victory against Bruggeafter entering at half-time on Wednesday. On another night he would have left with not just the player-of-the-match award but the match ball. Most importantly for Villa, Uefa rules permit Asensio to face his parent club. The ominous bit is Asensio is not yet at full fitness.“That’s the exciting thing for us,” McGinn says. “It’ll be a strange one for him, but maybe he’s got a bit to prove to them. He probably feels he deserved more game time [at PSG]. We love having him here. His quality is just clear to see. There’s a lot more to come for Marco and I’m sure he’ll be giving us some tips on how to get past PSG.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is a long way below Europe’s elite and fans expect their team to ­overwhelm opponents who operate in much smaller financial circles. They are waiting for Enzo Maresca to prove his positional play can dazzle.This was another strange Stamford Bridge occasion. The mood was muted, even though Chelsea advanced to a last-eight clash with Legia Warsaw by ­beating FC Copenhagen 3-1 on aggregate. A fourth consecutive win in all ­competitions was not without its complications and that meant the doubts around Maresca are not going away before Sunday’s trip to Arsenal.Admittedly, Maresca could take satisfaction from Chelsea ­securing a slender win thanks to a piece of individualism from Kiernan ­Dewsbury-Hall. His goal had ­nothing to do with coordinated team play. It was all down to Dewsbury-Hall’s ­persistence and opportunism.Maresca may be an easy target but sedate Chelsea need to up the tempo | Jacob SteinbergRead moreThe former Leicester midfielder will hope this can kickstart his ­Chelsea career. He was crucial when Maresca’s Leicester won promotion last season but has struggled since being reunited with the Italian. It is an odd situation. Dewsbury-Hall is the Maresca stalwart who rarely plays for Maresca. He is the replacement for Conor Gallagher, who was busy ­scoring for Atlético Madrid against Real Madrid this week. Fans who ­wonder about the wisdom of ­Chelsea’s ­project have buys like Dewsbury-Hall in mind.Afterwards, Maresca pointed to his side’s duty to please the supporters. “This club always won trophies in the past and we need to do our best to achieve our target this season,” he said. “We have to give the fans and the club a title.”Yet the disconnect between Maresca and the crowd was impossible to ignore. There was more booing at the end of a first half in which Chelsea fell woefully short of producing anything resembling incision in the final third. Copenhagen, who had hope of pulling off an unlikely comeback after a late goal left them 2-1 down after the first leg, did not have to extend themselves to keep their hosts at bay.Everything was too robotic and restrained. Only Tyrique George, the 19-year-old winger, threatened to inject urgency with a few direct runs down the right. On the whole, though, there was little flow or imagination to Chelsea. They played in front of Copenhagen and again seem puzzled about how to pull a back five out of shape.Jadon Sancho was quiet on the left. Pedro Neto threatened to burst through on goal on a couple of occasions but was mostly shut out. ­Copenhagen, who were backed by a vociferous away following, soon found confidence. Mohamed Elyounoussi was ­dangerous in the pockets. Josh Acheampong, filling in at left-back for Chelsea, had to make an important block early on.Maresca was concerned enough to introduce Cole Palmer and Marc Cucurella at half-time. Palmer had hoped to take the night off after playing with a stomach bug ­during Sunday’s victory against Leicester. Chelsea, though, cannot function without him. Palmer, who has been in a rut, needs others to step up and take on more responsibility in attack. Chelsea cannot rely on him every week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They remained unconvincing at the start of the ­second half and could have conceded when they Copenhagen caused ­problems with a couple of deep crosses.It was just as well that Copenhagen lacked the quality to take advantage. It always seemed likely that ­Chelsea’s greater resources would tell. So it proved when ­Dewsbury-Hall ­underlined his eagerness to impress by showing ­wonderful desire to force his way past a couple of ­challenges and advance on goal in the 55th ­minute. It was fine, determined play from the midfielder, who had moved into a deeper role following Palmer’s ­introduction, and he capped it off by driving a low shot past Diant Ramaj.Soothed by a two-goal cushion, the pressure lifted. Palmer was on a mission to end his goal drought, bending a shot wide. Neto tested Ramaj from 20 yards. Although Rodrigo Huescas wasted a late chance for Copenhagen, overall Filip Jörgensen had a quiet evening in goal. The problem is it was just as sedate in the stands.Explore more on these topicsEuropa Conference LeagueChelseaFC Copenhagenmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Rangers also squeaked past José Mourinho’s Fenerbahce in apenalty shootout.Of Fernandes, who now has 15 goals in all competitions this season, Amorim said: “We need to help him win titles because he deserves this. It is hard for a player like him sometimes – he wants to win really bad and sometimes too much. It is not a bad thing but sometimes he doesn’t trust his teammates but he is always there.“He can play set pieces, score -penalties, make transitions and help in the last 15 minutes of the game. I am trying to help the team, not thinking about Bruno but the team [and] near the box he is so dangerous.”United will face Lyon in the quarter-finals, with the first leg in France on 10 April before the return at Old Trafford a week later. Amorim was asked about Patrick Dorgu informing the referee, Benoît Bastien, that a late collision with Hamari Traoré was not a penalty. “It is the right thing to do so I am quite proud of him,” said the manager. “But I cannot say if it is 0-0 or losing I have the same response. He did well, he had a great performance. He is learning a lot in that position. He has the physicality.”Amorim was asked how important the win was for the remainder of the season. He said: “The feeling – and you can feel the fans, the noise: it is hard to explain, you feel the confidence from the supporters, it was a really good night.

Fine margins ensured the defender’s wait to make his mark under Arne Slot moves on to Wembley.Barring an unexpected selection decision from the Liverpool head coach on Sunday Quansah will start as an emergency right-back in theCarabao Cupfinal against Newcastle. Trent Alexander-Arnold is set to miss out with an ankle injury sustained against PSG on Tuesday, the second choice, Conor Bradley, remains sidelined with a hamstring problem and Slot’s third option, Joe Gomez, will not return from his own hamstring issue until the final weeks of the season. In many respects it is the opportunity Quansah has been longing for since the opening weekend of the season. Here it is, with the second League Cup winners’ medal of his young career at stake. The duel between the reinforcements, with Harvey Barnes likely to replace the suspended Anthony Gordon on Newcastle’s left flank, could prove significant.Liverpool may not be in the mood to dwell on positives from their performance against Luis Enrique’s slick and more resilient version of PSG, even if a penalty shootout is what ultimately separated an exhilarating contest between two of the best teams in Europe. But the central defender’s adaptation to an unaccustomed full-back role after his 73rd-minute introduction to a game of the highest quality was one. Not that the loss of Alexander-Arnold can be portrayed as anything but a setback forLiverpoolas they attempt to lift the gloom of their Champions League elimination by claiming the first trophy of the Slot era.Alexander-Arnold’s influence was growing at Anfield when he launched himself into a touchline challenge on Vitinha and turned an ankle. Concerns his departure would stymie Liverpool’s threat from right-back and enable Khvicha Kvaratskhelia to dominate from PSG’s left were allayed by the performance of the 22-year-old from Warrington. Quansah twice went close to heading Liverpool level on the night and back in front on aggregate, agonisingly so on the second occasion when his diving header beat Gianluigi Donnarumma but bounced away off the inside of the goalkeeper’s post. Quansah would have joined Harvey Elliott in achieving unlikely hero status against the French champions had that gone in.Defensively, Quansah was focused, alert and front-footed against the gifted Georgian and the equally impressive Désiré Doué when the PSG forwards switched. One sliding interception, having read Vitinha’s intentions perfectly, flipped a promising PSG opening into another Liverpool counterattack but Slot’s forwards failed to capitalise. The England Under-21 international established a benchmark in the second leg that Slot will want to see repeated at Wembley.View image in fullscreenJarell Quansah (left) was substituted at half-time against Ipswich in Liverpool’s first Premier League game of the season.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PALiverpool showed their faith in Quansah’s talent and long-term future in October by awarding him a new, improved contract only 17 months after his previous deal. It was reward for a fine breakthrough season in Jürgen Klopp’s final campaign in charge that brought 33 appearances, including a substitute’s contribution to the Carabao Cuptriumph against Chelsea. Winning Slot’s trust has been more of a battle, however, with the defender given a few punishing, public lessons in what the head coach expects.There was his half-time substitution in Slot’s first Premier League game in chargeat Ipswich. Liverpool’s new head coach was unhappy with the amount of duels his entire team lost in the first half at Portman Road but it was Quansah who paid the price and was taken off early. His hold on the centre-back position alongside Virgil van Dijk disappeared in that moment. Ibrahima Konaté replaced him for the second half, helped spark an immediate improvement, and went on to establish a commanding partnership with Van Dijk that could not be dislodged.“The next day he pulled me in,” Quansah later said of Slot’s substitution. “He went through his mindset and why he made the decision. I think the reasons he gave me were fair enough. It’s better it happened now than at any other point in the season. It gives me a bit of a kick up the backside, you could say.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After that rout it would be another five weeks before the defender featured again, this time in the fourth-roundtie at Brightonwhere one mistake led to a goal for the home side and he deflected in their second. Quansah then had to endure another difficult substitution when Slot replaced him with Konaté in stoppage time to preserve Liverpool’s 3-2 lead. The Liverpool head coach attempted to cushion the blow by insisting Quansah was in “an unlucky period” where the smallest error would result in a goal but, “if I look at his overall performance I really liked what I saw.”Patience has been required to wait for an opportunity behind one of the strongest centre-back pairings in the Premier League this season. Quansah’s 21 appearances under Slot have included 10 starts, two of them in the top flight. His next opportunity should come alongside Konaté and Van Dijk at Wembley. On the brief evidence of Tuesday night against PSG, Quansah is determined to seize it.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolCarabao CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The German has held talks with a ­number of players and there is intrigue over the direction he plans to takeEnglandin when they begin their ­qualifying campaign for the 2026 World Cup with home games against Albania and Latvia this month.Thomas Tuchel’s big England puzzle: picking the right players not the best | Jonathan WilsonRead moreLewis-Skelly, who has impressed since breaking into Arsenal’s first team this season, could be one of the standout picks in Tuchel’s squad. The versatile 18-year-old has caught the eye at left-back this season and his blistering rise could lead to him being fast-tracked into the senior set-up. Lewis-Skelly, who is yet to feature for the under-21 side, offers a solution on the left with Lewis Hall and Luke Shaw injured and Ben Chilwell short of match practice. Newcastle’s Dan Burn, who can play left-back or at centre-back, is a shock contender for a first call up. Tottenham’s Djed Spence and Crystal Palace’s Tyrick Mitchell are also left-sided options.On the opposite flank, Tuchel is expected to be without Liverpool’s Trent ­Alexander-Arnold, who has a knee injury, and must decide whether to keep faith with Kyle Walker. There is also the issue of whether to end White’s self-imposed exile. The ­Arsenal defender, who can play in the middle or on the right, left the 2022 World Cup early amid whispers of an uneasy relationship with Tuchel’s predecessor, Gareth Southgate, and his No 2, Steve Holland. Tuchel has spoken to White and opened the door to him returning but the Arsenal player is just back from injury.The Chelsea right-back Reece James is another Tuchel favourite who could come into contention after their time together at club level and there is a decision to make on the fitness of the Manchester United centre-back Harry Maguire. Manchester City’s John Stones is out. Everton’s Jarrad Branthwaite could feature alongside Ezri Konsa, Marc Guéhi and Levi Colwill, with Milan’s Fikayo Tomori potentially missing out. The West Ham right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka is rated as an outsider.England have enviable depth in attack and there is the possibility of a recall for Rashford, who has enjoyed a resurgence since joining Aston Villa on loan from Manchester United. But sources close to the forward fear that this camp could come too soon for Rashford, who was not selected for Euro 2024. Jack Grealish, another high-profile omission from the Euros, is at risk again. The Nottingham Forest winger Callum Hudson-Odoi is hopeful of a recall, with Noni Madueke and Bukayo Saka unavailable.Jarrod Bowen, Morgan Rogers, Morgan Gibbs-White and Anthony Gordon are pushing for selection but there are doubts over Eberechi Eze and James Maddison, while the Arsenal teenager Ethan Nwaneri is expected to be in the under-21 squad despite some sparkling displays for his club.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins has been the captain’s understudy and Tottenham’s Dominic Solanke has returned from a knee injury but they face competition from Ipswich’s Liam Delap. Brighton’s Danny Welbeck is a wildcard option, as is Ivan Toney, despite playing in Saudi Arabia. Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton could replace Lille’s Angel Gomes in midfield.

Under the current rule, the VAR had to call the referee signalling that the goal should be disallowed.“Uefa will enter discussions with Fifa and Ifab to determine whether the rule should be reviewed in cases where a double touch is clearly unintentional.”Atlético have lost against their city rivals in each of their six encounters in European competition. Madrid will contest their 12th quarter-final in the past 15 seasons when they face Arsenal next month, with the first leg at the Emirates Stadium on 8 April and the return on 16 April.Explore more on these topicsLaws of footballAtlético MadridReal MadridChampions LeagueUefaVideo assistant referees (VARs)newsShareReuse this content"

They added that Jones is “fully cooperating with law enforcement as they continue to actively investigate the violence that occurred.”“Ms Jones has chosen to use her voice to speak up for herself,” said Angelica Cogliano, who is one of the lawyers representing Jones. “In doing so, she looks forward to the facts and circumstances of that night coming to light through the formal legal process, and getting the justice that she deserves.”Worthy was arrested last Fridayand held on a charge of assault on a family or household member in which their breath was impeded, or choking in common terms. He was released the following day, when Williamson county district attorney Shawn Dick said that his office has spoken with witnesses and was not accepting the case at that time. Williamson county includes parts of Austin, where Worthy played college football at the University of Texas.In a statement, Worthy’s attorneys, Chip Lewis and Sam Bassett, said their client was innocent of the charge against him. They said the allegation was made by a woman who had been living in Worthy’s home, and that she had been asked to leave multiple times over the last two weeks “upon discovery of her infidelity.”“She has refused to vacate the residence and made a number of extortive efforts prior to resorting to this baseless allegation against Mr Worthy,” the lawyers said. “The complainant further destroyed a room in the residence, scratched Mr Worthy’s face and ripped out parts of his hair, which there is photographic evidence of. Worthy told law enforcement at the time of the incident he did not want to press charges against the complainant.”The Chiefs said on Saturday that they were aware of the situation and still gathering information.Worthy was chosen by the Chiefs with the 28th overall pick in last year’s draft after setting the record for the fastest 40-yard dash at theNFLcombine. He got off to a quick start by scoring a pair of touchdowns in his NFL debut, and after a midseason lull, he became the Chiefs’ go-to wide receiver as they chased an unprecedented third consecutive Super Bowl title.Worthy finished with 59 catches for 638 yards and six TDs while running 20 times for 104 yards and three more scores. He was one of the few bright spots for the Chiefs in their 40-22 loss to Philadelphia in the Super Bowl. Worthy caught all eight of his targets for 157 yards and a pair of touchdowns at the Superdome in New Orleans.Explore more on these topicsKansas City ChiefsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Tan left in August over differences about the chipmaker’s direction after the company suffered several years of market underperformance.Tan will be tasked with reviving the company’s fortunes after it missed out on the artificial intelligence-driven semiconductor boom while plowing billions of dollars into building out its chip-making business.Intelhas posted several quarters of market share losses in data centers and PCs, as well as billion-dollar losses in its manufacturing business, and over the past five years, the stock has lost about 60% of its value, a period of time when the Nasdaq Composite Index and S&P 500 have both more than doubled.Delays and uncertainty dog Intel’s dream of Rust belt manufacturing hubRead more“Tan in as CEO at Intel was as good as stakeholders could have hoped for,” said TD Cowen analysts, noting that he has “deep relationships” across the chip ecosystem that could draw customers to the company’s contract manufacturing business. Tan will take the helm next week, three months after Intel ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger. Tan had been brought on to the board two years earlier to help turn the company around, but left due to disagreements over the size of the company’s workforce and its culture. Skepticism about Intel’s future has deepened in recent months amid reports that rivals, including Broadcom, were evaluating the chip design and marketing business, while TSMC has separately studied controlling some or all of its plants.Analysts expect Tan to follow Gelsinger in keeping the chip design and manufacturing operations together, a plan that Tan hinted at in a letter to employees by vowing to make Intel a top foundry, an industry term for a contract chip manufacturer. Some analysts have said the foundry business may find it difficult to draw orders from chip designers wary of entrusting production to a rival.But Tan, who oversaw more than a decade of strong growth at Cadence Design Systems, an Intel supplier and chip-design software firm, enjoys strong credibility as a “neutral party” that could help Intel overcome some of the challenges, analysts said.Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research also said Tan’s previous two-year tenure on the Intel board would aid his efforts.That “should have given him a pretty good idea of where all the bodies are buried, and he should be much realistic in his evaluations and outlook than prior leadership (it was unbridled optimism proved to be Pat’s undoing)”, Rasgon said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Plus, can the left reclaim techno-optimism?Blake MontgomeryThu 13 Mar 2025 13.20 EDTLast modified on Thu 13 Mar 2025 13.23 EDTShareHello, and welcome to TechScape. In this week’s edition, the crypto industry’s political investments pay off in spades, the left attempts to reclaim an optimistic view of our shiny technological future, and your memories ofSkype.Why crypto is enjoying a political bonanzaThe US presidenthosted prominent crypto leaders at the White House on Fridayin what seemed like a choreographed climax to weeks of handing the industry win after win.The day before,Donald Trumpsigned an executive order to create a “strategic reserve” of cryptocurrency for the US, which he called “digital Fort Knox for digital gold to be stored”. It’s just one of several recent announcements that indicated a new and friendly posture toward the industry.Throughout last week, US oversight agencies announced they would drop investigations into major crypto companies without penalty – Coinbase, Gemini, OpenSea, Yuga Labs, Robinhood Crypto, Uniswap Labs, Consensys, Kraken – and nixed fraud charges against an entrepreneur who had bought $75m worth of Trump’s meme coin, $Trump. Two weeks ago, the new leadership of the US’s main financial regulator declared that “meme coins”, flash-in-the-pan cryptocurrencies like the onelaunched by Donald Trump himself, would not face strict oversight.Trump had signaled the moves already on the campaign trail. He was the first major-party presidential candidate to accept crypto campaign contributions and promised while campaigning to make the US “the crypto capital of the world”. On Friday, he reiterated that pledge to make the country “the bitcoin superpower”.As an industry, crypto displays a victim complex similar to that of Trump, who often speaks from the highest seat of power as if his mother were ordering him to bed without dessert. David Sacks, Trump’s appointed czar of crypto, said that the industry had been “subjected to persecution” and that “nobody understands that better than you”.He was speaking to Trump, of course. Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, said at the White House crypto summit: “This marks another milestone to the end of the war on crypto.” Though Winklevoss’s whining may seem unearned, Joe Biden’s administration had, in fact, adopted a tough regulatory attitude towards cryptocurrency, aiming to oversee digital, decentralized finance as securities, subject to the same regulations as Wall Street’s stocks and bonds. All those investigations had to originate somewhere.The summit was a victory for crypto and a spectacular return on its collective investment in politics. Combined, the attenders had donated $11m to Trump’s inauguration, according tothe Intercept. During the 2024 campaign, crypto spent nearlya quarter of a billion dollars, far more than any other sector, though the industry’s main political action committee notably did not contribute to the presidential race.Crypto is riding high, but you wouldn’t know it by the price of bitcoin, usually considered a sign of the industry’s overall health. The main character of cryptocurrency is down some 13% since the start of the year, which tracks more closely with the outlook of the overall US stock market – not good – than many crypto enthusiasts would care to countenance. Trump has said out loud that arecession might come for the US economyas he flips and flops on major tariffs, which has bewildered investors and sent US equities spiraling, particularly in recent days.If you only click on four headlines about Elon Musk, click on these:SpaceX’s Starship explodes in second failure for Elon Musk’s Mars programMusk tells Republicans he isn’t to blame for mass firings of federal workersMusk survives as fellow of Royal Society despite anger among scientistsWhite House to overhaul $42.5bn Biden-era internet plan – probably to Musk’s advantageCan the left reclaim techno-optimism?View image in fullscreen‘The left used to embrace technology.’Illustration: Edward Carvalho-Monaghan/Guardian DesignDo you have faith in the future?An excitement for the polished chrome of days ahead reads as conservative in today’s political climate. Techno-optimism has become the provenance of the right. It’s a counterintuitive development: liberal politics may aim to change the present for the better, but the left, in its opposition to Silicon Valley’s billionaires, is now the party of techno-pessimism. Conservative politics, by contrast, aim to preserve and return to the past, but US Republicans and rightwingers around the world trumpet technological progress in their alliance with its funders. The rapid advancement of technology would seem to lend itself to the liberal ethos, upending ossified norms in the name of human betterment, and yet today, the dominant vision of an advanced future is one hawked by billionaires expressing adoration for unfettered capitalism.My colleagueAmana Fontanella-Khanwrites in an essay introducing a new Guardian series, Breakthrough, about how the left can reclaim its lost belief in the possibility of a platinum tomorrow:“Hope is scarce, pessimism is high and despair is pervasive. As one meme that captures the grim, morbid mood of our age reads: ‘My retirement plan is civilisational collapse.’“On the extreme other end of public sentiment sit Silicon Valley billionaires: they are some of the most optimistic people on earth. Of course, it’s easy to be optimistic when you are sitting on enough money to sway national politics. And yet, the source of their optimism isn’t simply money. It is also a deep-seated faith in unfettered technological advances.“But can and should the left advance its own techno-optimism? Can it put forward a vision of a brighter future that can compete with the grand visions of space exploration presented by Elon Musk? Can it make the case that science and technology ought to be harnessed to deliver breakthroughs, abundance, sustainability and flourishing of human potential? And what would a progressive, leftwing techno-optimism look like? A techno-optimism that the 99% could get on board with, especially communities of color, including Black people who have historically been excluded, and even harmed, by scientific and technological breakthroughs? These are some of the questions that this new series, Breakthrough, launched by the Guardian examines.”Read her full essay and others in the series hereskip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hundreds of you responded, and we have compiled your reminiscences, which include not only photos and your words but also an original song based on the inimitable Skype ringtone. I can’t embed the song in this email, but you can listen to it on the article page:Skype shutdown surfaces sweet memories: ‘I proposed marriage’.In addition to musical inspiration, you recounted to us how Skype bridged the distance to faraway loved ones, both family and soon-to-be family – two of you proposed marriage via Skype video calls. I am not often moved to tears while editing stories, but these recollections touched me.***Here are a few excellent examples of what you told us:I proposed to my Swedish husband over Skype using sticky notes. We got married on 5-5-15, the same day Skype will end its service. It’s very sad, I especially liked it since it was from my husband’s homeland of Sweden. Skype played a big part in our lives in keeping us connected while we were dating and it will always be in my heart.– Holly, IowaIn 2004, I moved across the world to attend university in the United States. Phone calls were too expensive, so I would spend hours on Skype chatting with my family and friends back home. When we went around the dinner table saying what we were grateful for my first American Thanksgiving, Skype was my answer. Homesickness was my malady, Skype was my medicine.– Laura, Los AngelesThe person with whom I used Skype the most and used it last was my friend Harald. I live in Wisconsin and work at the university in Madison. Harald was from Germany but did a postdoctoral fellowship in Madison in the early 2000s. We became friends and, interestingly, we grew much closer after he moved back to Germany. We would get together before or after conferences and do bike trips together, and we visited each other many times over the years.Harald’s preferred way of communicating when we were on opposite sides of the world was by Skype. He’d use it as a verb. “Let’s Skype next Tuesday,” he’d say. I would often tease him as new platforms became popular that he was wedded to this outdated mode of communication. He died about two years ago, and I miss him terribly. And any time I hear about Skype I think of him.– Matthew, WisconsinFor more memories of Skype, read the full story hereThe wider TechScape‘Trump Gaza’ AI video intended as political satire, says creatorUK watchdog drops competition review of Microsoft’s OpenAI partnershipI have been an AI researcher for 40 years.

Much more than cosy – it’s healingSarah Maria GriffinThu 13 Mar 2025 07.04 EDTShareThe term “cosy game” typically inspires one of two responses in those of us who play video games regularly. It will either call you in with the promise of soft, resource-management oriented gameplay whose slower pace offers a gentle escape and a bucolic alternative to gunslinging and high-stress adventure. Or it will repel you – as admittedly, it repels me. Cosy is often a kind of code for twee, low-stakes domestic adventures where drama is eschewed in favour of repetitive tasks intended to generate comfort, or imitate lightning-in-a-bottle resource management sims such asStardew ValleyorAnimal Crossing.So when faced with Wanderstop, a colourful game in which a fallen warrior trades in her fighting life for managing a tea shop, I was hesitant. However, this is Davey Wreden’s third project, after The Stanley Parable and The Beginner’s Guide, which means that, if it is anything like its predecessors, it will be full of surprises and made with deep attention to detail and artistic vision. Wreden is an auteur – one of his trademarks being a knowing, wry postmodernism. His work bends what the medium of the video game is capable of, and thankfully this latest offering is no exception.View image in fullscreenUrn your living … Wanderstop.Photograph: Annapurna InteractiveWanderstop excels at combining the nature of the gameplay with a narrative about the perils of burnout. The game practises what it preaches – it does not simply gesture towards a quiet life; rather, it erects one around the player whether they like it or not.Alta, our fallen warrior protagonist, distinctly does not like it. She has lost too many battles in a row, and on a quest to study under her hero, finds herself collapsing in the woods. Boro, a benevolent gentleman who runs the Wanderstop teashop, takes Alta in and coaxes her into participating in some tea-making and light chores until she recovers. Characters come and go while the player makes them tea and maintains the colourful and dangerously Ghibli-esque gardens. Aside from making tea, you can take care of some fine creatures that look like puffins. Take photos. Sweep. Gather trinkets. Read some of the books that are lying around. Grow plants, pick seeds, grow bigger plants, pick fruit. Use the fruit to make tea. Give the tea away to your guests, or drink it yourself, staring into the lovely landscape.View image in fullscreenGrowing pleasure … Wanderstop.Photograph: Annapurna InteractiveThis is not an unfamiliar vignette. Wytchwood, Spiritfarer, Spirittea, Moonstone Island – there are plenty of games that deal in combining botanical ingredients to fulfil the wishes of whimsical creatures. What makes Wanderstop different is that it refuses to hand you progress or resolution. There is no way to optimise, no way to tick off boxes, no pressure. No winning. The game refuses to give you the satisfaction of the grind, of boxes ticking up, neat little rows of plants. To explain how the story manages this would be to spoil the great magic trick of the game – but suffice to say I was awestruck at real ludonarrative harmony in action. It is one thing to talk, within the dialogue and story of a game, about burnout. About working so hard you can no longer even think about working. It is one thing to extol the virtues of rest. It is another altogether to actively demonstrate what surrender and healing look and feel like.On a technical level, the game offers no resistance – the controls are immaculate, straightforward and cleanly executed. The music is pleasant and unobtrusive, the voice acting is used in small doses and is very strong. The mechanical aspects of the game are perfectly tuned and the dialogue and incidental text are funny, surprising, and shockingly poignant when they need to be. There are no snags to trip up on, nothing in the way of a deeply transporting experience.It takes around 12 hours to “complete” Wanderstop, but for me the game demanded a replay immediately. I was eager to return to the gardens around the teashop, to look for secrets, to talk to Boro as much as possible. To linger for a little while more. To slow down, and to consider what exactly it is that is rushing all of us. If the slippery and infallible nature of the gameplay is frustrating to seasoned resource management fans, I would argue that that is exactly the point. To play while letting go.Wanderstop’s cosy and cute exterior belies something much richer and much cleverer than I have seen in quite some time. It is a masterpiece in a cute disguise – offering the player a place worth visiting, staying and paying attention to.Wanderstop is out now, £20Explore more on these topicsGamesPCPlayStation 5Xbox series S/XreviewsShareReuse this content"

The author narrates, in a fizzy historic present, her youthful idealism when she arrives atFacebook(now Meta) to work on global affairs in 2011, after a stint as an ambassador for New Zealand. Some years later she finds a female agency worker having a seizure on the office floor, surrounded by bosses who are ignoring her. The scales falling from her eyes become a blizzard. These people, she decides, just “didn’t give a fuck”.Mark Zuckerberg’s first meeting with a head of state was with the Russian prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, in 2012. He was sweaty and nervous, but slowly he acquires a taste for the limelight. He asks (unsuccessfully) to be sat next to Fidel Castro at a dinner. In 2015 he asks Xi Jinping if he’ll “do him the honor of naming his unborn child”. (Xi refuses.) He’s friendly with Barack Obama, until the latter gives him a dressing-down about fake news.In 2016, Facebook embeds staff in Donald Trump’s campaign “alongside Trump campaign programmers, ad copywriters, media buyers, network engineers, and data scientists”, helping him win. This inspires Zuckerberg to consider running for president himself, and he tours US swing states in 2017. Wynn-Williams describes his speeches as sounding “like what a kid thinks a president sounds like”. One goes: “The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, act anew.”Zuckerberg calls politicians unfriendly to Facebook ‘adversaries’ and instructs his team to apply pressure to ‘pull them over to our side’Meanwhile, in an effort to do business in China, his company has been offering the Chinese Communist party a “white-glove service”, and a genocide has occurred in Myanmar following a flood of false anti-Muslim stories posted on Facebook. In time Facebook abandons internet.org, its idea to give developing countries free access to the internet, or at least Facebook, pivots to the “metaverse”, a bad virtual-reality game populated by people who for a long time did not have legs, and finally pivots again to AI.Zuckerberg, in short, turns out to be a giant man-baby suffering from a severe case of the Dunning-Kruger effect, whereby people overestimate their own cognitive abilities. His colleagues obsequiously let him win at board games. He calls politicians unfriendly to Facebook “adversaries” and instructs his team to apply pressure to “pull them over to our side”. He blames his assistants when he forgets his own passport.Floating through the book like a toxic ice queen, meanwhile, is Facebook’s COO, Sheryl Sandberg. Wynn-Williams isn’t buying her “Lean In” talk. In one of two remarkable body-horror interludes in the book (the first is when she is almost eaten by a shark as a child), Wynn-Williams nearly dies in childbirth, but she is still harassed for work updates during her recovery. When she returns to the office her male boss gives her an unflattering performance review. “You weren’t responsive enough,” he says. “In my defense,” she replies, “I was in a coma for some of it.”This sounds like a job for a famous champion of women in the workplace. “Friends who have fallen for Sheryl’s Lean In schtick,” Wynn-Williams writes, “earnestly recommend going to her with my concerns.” But she is not convinced. She has already been sent to a Zika hotspot while heavily pregnant, and to Japan while pregnant again, to help promote Sandberg’s book.Wynn-Williams left Facebook in 2018 to work on “unofficial negotiations between the US and China on AI weapons”. Has the company’s office culture improved since then? A clue might be Zuckerberg’s recent appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast. He complains that corporate culture has become too “neutered” and needs a new injection of “masculine energy”. In February, he visited the White House to talk to Donald Trump about AI.Editor’s note: since this review was written Meta has responded to Wynn-Williams’ book, calling it “a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives”.Careless People by Sarah Wynn-William is published by Macmillan (£22).

Oldish people like myself are less likely to own smartphones, increasingly likely to be marginalised as a result, lucky to remember life without their constant intrusion.Whatever your age, fight back, be phone-free and proud.

Less than two weeks after Donald Trump berated Volodymyr Zelenskyy, ejected him from the White House and cut off Ukraine’s support, he U-turned tothreatenfinancial measures “that would be very bad for Russia” if it did not reach a deal with Kyiv. Ukraine’sacceptance of a 30-day ceasefire proposal, building on its own suggestion of a halt in air and maritime conflict, threw the onus on Moscow. On Thursday, Vladimir Putin claimed to support the idea in theory – but warned of “serious issues” to address.Ukraine’s agreement prompted the resumption of US intelligence sharing and military aid, which may well have been Kyiv’s primary aim. Mr Trump would like to take the credit – and perhaps aspires to a Nobel prize – for a peace deal. Mr Trump, who was hosting Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, described the Russian president’s remarks as “very promising” albeit not “complete”. Even if he outsources the patience and focus required to reach an agreement, it is clear that he has no interest in the injustice or illegality of the invasion, that his sympathies lie with Mr Putin, and that he bears a deep grudge against Mr Zelenskyy.Fundamentally, Moscow can be more confident of its position than it was even a month ago. The west has been shown to be fundamentally divided and therefore weakened. On the battlefield, Russia also believes itself to have the upper hand, however painful its progress has been. It does not want togive Ukraine the chance to regroup. Speaking ahead of a meeting with the US envoy, Steve Witkoff, Mr Putin was too canny to dismiss Mr Trump’s plans outright. There will always be ways to defer a deal, or sabotage it later.The bigger issue is not its short-term hope of taking more territory, but its long-term, maximalist ambition to control Ukraine. Mr Putin remarked that a ceasefire should “remove the root causes of this crisis”: among other things, he wants its demilitarisation and assurances that it won’t join Nato. (“They discuss Nato, and being in Nato, and everybody knows what the answer to that is,” Mr Trump remarked.) Mr Putin certainly does not want troops from Nato countries there. But without them, Ukraine has no reason to believe that a halt on Russia’s part would be any more than a tactical measure. This is why, as Sir Keir Starmer said on Thursday, “It has to be a peace where the deal is defended.”Provisional halts in combat can lead to lasting peace; no treaty was signedto end the Korean war. And Mr Putincould yet see genuine advantages to a diplomatic route, especially if it involves early relaxation of sanctions. Russia is expert at interference operations and would surely see opportunities in a post-war Ukraine, with the option to return to warfare always available further down the track.The zigzags of recent days may materially affect the outcome of this conflict. The halting of aid and intelligence facilitated Russia taking back territory that Ukraine had seized in Kursk. Its resumption will allow Ukraine to fight better for longer. But the overall trajectory is still clear, and it leads away from US support for Ukraine and Europe. It is not unthinkable that Mr Trump might attemptto punish European nationsfor supplying arms to Kyiv in due course. Whether he is willing to exert real pressure on Mr Putin will shortly become clear. But neither Ukraine nor its friends can expect it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Trump’s cuts put us all at riskTerry GarciaNoaa, my former employer, is an integral part of our daily lives, tracking hurricanes, supporting safe flights and helping farmersThu 13 Mar 2025 09.00 EDTShareAcross theUnited States, from rural communities to coastal cities, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) is an integral part of our daily lives, safeguarding communities and fostering economic vitality.Whether it is tracking the path ofhurricanes, managing our nation’s fisheries, providing critical information to air traffic controllers and airlines, or helping farmers plan for weather extremes, Noaa’s science, services and products have a significant impact on every American.Having served as the deputy administrator of Noaa and before that its general counsel, I have witnessed first-hand the indispensable role this agency plays. TheTrump administration’s proposed draconian, reckless and, in many cases, unlawful budget and personnel cuts to the agency should alarm us all.These cuts will do little to achieve their stated goal of reducing the size and cost of government. They instead jeopardize the safety, economic prosperity and overall wellbeing of our nation.I should add that the administration’s assault on science is not limited to my former agency. Government-wide cuts are sparking outrage and demonstrations across the country.Funding Noaa saves lives, guides critical industries, strengthens our economy and reinforces our global leadershipEach year, Noaa’s National Weather Service (NWS) issues more than 1.5m forecasts and 50,000 weather warnings. By providing critical lead time ahead of hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires and severe storms, Noaa’s forecasts save billions of dollars in economic losses annually and thousands of lives.Noaa’s continuing efforts to improve the accuracy of hurricane track forecasts have reduced the area of uncertainty for coastal evacuations, helping local governments, businesses and families avoid unnecessary costs. A recent study estimated that improvements in forecasting have resulted in an annual per-hurricane cost reduction of $5bn.In the aviation industry, Noaa forecasts and data-monitoring systems help ensure safe and efficient operations. Accurate weather information is essential for planning flight routes, avoiding severe weather and ensuring safe takeoffs and landings. Noaa also tracks weather in space, including solar flares and geomagnetic storms that can disrupt or interfere with technologies essential to safe air travel: satellite communications, GPS navigation and aircraft communication systems.The importance of Noaa’s work extends beyond public safety and economic savings to a range of private-sector applications. Private weather providers such as AccuWeather and the Weather Channel depend on Noaa’s open data to offer localized forecasts, while insurance companies use it to assess risk and set policy rates.‘Cruel and thoughtless’: Trump fires hundreds at US climate agency NoaaRead moreThe US commercial seafood industry supports roughly 1.7m jobs and generates more than $300bn annually in total sales. Noaa’s fisheries management, research and inspection programs are critical to sustaining these jobs, preserving ecosystems, ensuring robust seafood supplies, and guaranteeing that safe seafood is sold throughout the United States.Additionally, saltwater recreational fishing is a significant economic driver in coastal communities, supporting tens of thousands of jobs and contributing billions annually to local economies. All of this is reliant on well-managed fisheries and healthy marine habitats.Moreover, Noaa marine sanctuaries protect critical habitats, support biodiversity and provide opportunities for research, education and tourism, contributing billions of dollars to local economies. For instance, the Florida Keys national marine sanctuary, one of 18 in the US, is estimated to contribute $4bn annually to Florida’s economy and supports 43,000 jobs.Farmers and ranchers depend on Noaa’s seasonal and sub-seasonal forecasts to make decisions about planting, harvesting, irrigation and risk management. A single drought or flood forecast can mean the difference between profitable harvests and financial ruin.Similarly, the US Department of Transportation reports that more than $5.4tn of commerce crosses US ports annually. Noaa’s nautical charts, tide tables and navigation services are essential for keeping these ports and waterways running safely and efficiently, thereby supporting global trade and local jobs.Furthermore, urban planners and emergency managers at all levels rely on Noaa’s climate data and long-range forecasts and projections to design roads, bridges and flood defenses capable of withstanding rising sea levels and stronger storms. By ensuring that infrastructure investments are based on accurate, up-to-date data, billions of dollars in future repair and disaster costs can be avoided.From safeguarding families in the path of severe storms to supporting the economic health of fishing towns and agricultural communities, Noaa’s programs are indispensable. Efforts by theTrump administrationto hobble the agency through budget and wholesale staff reductions are not only misguided but also dangerous. If President Trump and his administration are serious about making America great, they will recognize that funding Noaa is an investment that saves lives, guides critical industries, strengthens our economy and reinforces our nation’s global leadership in innovation and science.Terry Garcia served as the assistant secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere and as deputy administrator of Noaa.

He declared that the Washington Post will focus its opinion section on “personal liberties and free markets”. That surely means more editorial attention onstifling monopolies like Amazon, right?Mainstream media outlets have longfaced dwindling audiencesand, as a result,relied more and moreon corporate benefactors. Now that those benefactors are competing to prove loyalty to their own benefactor in the White House, these essential institutions are stuck carrying water for the billionaire class, or elsedisappearing altogether. The task of rebuilding truly independent news outlets, then, falls to journalists, readers and any concerned citizens who recognize how imperiled our free press has become – if there is to be any hope of the fourth estate holding the line against the second Trump regime.Editorial encroachment by corporate interests dates back to the inception of the media age, when the competing newspaper empires of the ultra-wealthy William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer engaged in a sensationalistrace to the bottom, publishing incendiary headlines, exaggerations, gossip and rumors that (among other ramifications) helpedprovoke the Spanish-American war.Yellow journalism, as it was called, abated thanks to the regulatory efforts of independent agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which establishedthe fairness doctrinerequiring equal coverage of conflicting viewpoints on consequential issues (like Trump’s ongoing attemptto take over the FCC). But Ronald Reagan, in his laissez-faire frenzy,repealed that rule. Not to be outdone, Bill Clinton signed the deregulatoryTelecommunications Act of 1996, whichcritics have deemed“essentially bought and paid for by corporate media lobbies”.We are now witnessing mass public capitulation from corporate media owners in a way that feels unprecedentedThat same year, the Nation published a special issue on what we calledthe National Entertainment State. It detailed the growing media-industrial complex, where the corporations programming our news were increasingly programming public opinion. We represented this syndicate via a glossy centerfold diagram of an octopus with four tentacles, one for each of America’s dominant media conglomerates: Disney, General Electric, Time Warner and Westinghouse (now CBS). Today,six tentacles controlover 90% of our information.Things are different now, and not for the better. While the news has represented a small cog in larger corporate structures long before this second Trump administration, we are now witnessing mass public capitulation from corporate owners in a way that feels unprecedented. Whether today’s billionaire media owners are angling for large federal contracts or anticipatorily bending the knee so their companies are not seen as “the enemy”, the chilling effect is the same: major media publications are even more incentivized now to treat the rich and powerful with kid gloves, if not outright sycophancy.The few that refuse to do this will have to face the wrath of our notoriously censorious,litigioushead of state. The most powerful man in the world is currentlysuing Iowa pollster Ann Selzerfor merely predicting that Kamala Harris would win the state last November; what he calls “election fraud” most people call “polling”. With that context, is there any reason to expect that prominent players likeParamount and Skydancewould do anything but hold the line if it means getting FCC approval for their merger?The natural counterbalance to for-profit media would seem to be non-profit newsrooms. They need not go cross-eyed from trying to keep in view both the public’s interest and that of their owner. In the US alone there are at least475 independent outlets, fromthe Marshall Projecttothe Center for Public Integrity, which haswon several Pulitzer prizesfor its investigative reporting. And independent journalism is currently enjoying a renaissance on self-publishing platformslike Substackandthe newly launched Noosphere. These sites offer refuge for writers that have renounced (or been renounced by) corporate news, includingMehdi HasanandMatt Taibbi. The journalistic equivalent of farm-to-table, it cuts out any meddlesome middle-moguls between the writer and the reader.

For all their latent bias, our media behemoths are uniquely positioned to furnish the resources to fund years-long investigations that often incur legal backlash, such asthe Pentagon Papers– which might not have resonated as deeply with the Mailchimp logo at the bottom.Not so long ago, Jeff Bezos was proud to bear this torch. At the inception of his ownership, heclaimed Katharine Graham’s pugnacious leadershipas his model, and seemingly sincerely so, even if the Post didgo soft on its coverageof Amazon of its own volition. I experienced Bezos’s benign neglect first-hand. From 2011 to 2022, Ipenned over 500 columnsfor the paper, most of them during Bezos’s tenure – including columnsdirectly criticizing Amazon’s labor practicesand eventhe corporate bias of the Post itself. I never received any note remotely resembling the kind of editorial restrictions that he is imposing today – the likes of which just led the columnist and associate editor Ruth Marcus toresignafter four decades at the paper. Nevertheless, for a time, at least in this case, corporate ownership didn’t have to be mutually exclusive with editorial independence.But until that detente between owner and editorial is re-established, audiences and reporters will continue to flee compromised publications. In his email to the Washington Post’s team, Bezos argued that this newspaper of record could dodge offering a variety of perspectives because “the internet does that job”. It will take a new movement of responsible readers and benefactors to ensure that this is true.Katrina vanden Heuvel is editorial director and publisher of the Nation, she is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and she has contributed to theWashington Post, the New York Times and the Los Angeles TimesExplore more on these topicsWashington PostOpinionNew York TimesPress freedomUS press and publishingNewspapersNewspapers & magazinescommentShareReuse this content"

Mahmoud Khalil’sdetentionby federal agents – reportedly Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers – despite his legal, permanent resident status will probably have its intended effect. People will speak up less; their fear of the irreversible harm meted out by a vengeful state is justified. Now we are all left to contend with the wreckage of the first amendment to the US constitution, which used to guarantee the right to speech in this country.Responsibility for the erosion of our rights is attributable – in part – to the bipartisan embrace of the non-governmental, non-profit sector. That’s because from the 1940s onward, the federal government has ceded much state authority to philanthropies and non-profits. Those groups, in turn, have acted to craft policy – everything from how to develop equitable housing or the benefits of inoculating children to ensuring that speech targetingIsraelis punishable by law.Mahmoud Khalil’s treatment should not happen in a democracy | Moustafa BayoumiRead moreThe tax code ensures that we subsidize special interest groups, such as theIsrael lobby, even as it skirts the ordinary mechanisms of democratic policymaking and accountability. Today, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a rightwing Israel advocacy group, has taken the lead in seeking to undermine bedrock American freedoms in support of Israel. The Heritage Foundation’sProject Estherroadmap explicitly describes its goal of having “foreign [‘Hamas Support Network’] leaders and members deported from the US”.It should be said here that “Hamas Support Network” is a made-up, strangely emotional and overwrought phrase used by the Heritage Foundation to describecollege students who opposeIsrael’s genocide in Palestine.Inher essayHow Philanthropy Made and Unmade American Liberalism, Lila Corwin Berman, a professor of American Jewish history at New York University, argues that the rise of the philanthropic apparatus in America, defined broadly as tax-exempt, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), presented special interests with the means to exercise power in an unregulated, nontransparent way.Starting in the early 20th century, when the federal income tax was codified into law, special effort was made to exempt “public-benefit associations” from taxation. The argument was that they acted in the public good while simultaneously representing the best of capitalist success, a core tenet of American liberalism.There was a practical component to the argument, too. Philanthropies could act as policy labs – in the 1930s, the Carnegie Foundationcould support educational programsaway from the public. If policies were successful, they could be implemented across a broader swathe of society. For their utility, NGOs and philanthropies received tax-exempt status. Yet, as Corwin Berman said, “any time there’s a tax exemption, it’s a tax expenditure, but it’s an expenditure which avoids public scrutiny”. When Nixon restructuredUSAidthrough the Foreign Assistance Act in 1973, it was in part to obscure government efforts “that doubled as global capitalist and neocolonial ventures” – all without democratic oversight or public participation.Early opposition to private policymaking for the “public good” came from anti-elite quarters and from the right. In the 1960s, Wright Patman, a populist Democratic representative from Texas, kicked off a series of investigations designed to curtail the power of what’s sometimes called the “submerged state”.But in the 80s and 90s, the right began to co-opt non-governmental frameworks. The Heritage Foundation and others learned how to leverage “philanthropy as a tool and a cudgel”, as Berman said to me. Today, non-profits work across a broad range of policy issues both domestically and abroad. Many of the groups that have engineered the bipartisan consensus on the suppression of speech that is critical of Israel are non-profits. They obtain tax-exempt status and simultaneously craft policy, and they do so on behalf of Democrats andRepublicans, away from public scrutiny.The ADL, which controls total net assets of 200m tax-free dollars, in particular lobbied for policy responses to student activism in both the Biden andTrump administrations. In 2022, the ADL – whichregularly conflatesantisemitism with criticism of Israel –commendedthe Biden administration for developing a “national strategy to combat antisemitism”.The statement went on to take credit for the policy: “This is one of the steps that we have long advocated for as part of a holistic approach to address the antisemitism that has been increasingly normalized in society.”After Khalil’s detention, the ADL, whose leader, Jonathan Greenblatt, was paidmore than $1.2min 2022, issued astatementon X that reads in part: “We appreciate the Trump Administration’s broad, bold set of efforts to counter campus antisemitism.”Threaten campuses, shut down debate: that’s what free speech looks like under Trump | Owen JonesRead moreThere is an irony in all this. The right is now on a mission todefund universities, a process which started withangry pro-Israelbillionaires on X. It seems reasonable to expect the IRS to be weaponized to revoke the tax-exempt status of philanthropies and other elite institutions deemed to be sympathetic to the Democratic party’s agenda.Khalil’s detention – a shocking assault by the Israel lobby on American freedom – is not the first time that constitutional rights in this country have been assailed by a president. Abraham Lincolnfamously suspendedhabeas corpus during the civil war, this country’s first major constitutional crisis. But this may be the first time that a dramatic erosion in Americans’ constitutional liberties has been engineered by policymaking organizations that are subsidized by the public but are accountable to no one at all.Ahmed Moor is a writer and fellow at the Foundation for Middle East Peace.

Now we know the world’s richest man does tooThu 13 Mar 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 13 Mar 2025 08.16 EDTShareOn Saturday morning, I woke up to a nightmare of notifications. On Sunday, it got worse.Elon Muskhad tweeted and amplified inflammatory lies about me and Tesla Takedown, a growing national grassroots movement peacefullyprotestingatTeslashowrooms that I’m proudly a part of. Musk tweeted: “Costa is committing crimes.”As a longtime local activist and organizer in Seattle, I’m accustomed to some conflict with powerful forces. The intention of the Tesla Takedown movement is to make a strong public stand against the tech oligarchy behind theTrump administration’s cruel and illegal actions, and to encourage Americans tosell their Teslas and dump the company’s stock. Protests like these – peaceful, locally organized, and spreading across the world – are at the heart of free speech in a democracy and a cornerstone of US political traditions. So it’s telling that the response from so-called “free speech absolutist” Musk has been to single out individuals – and spread lies about us and our movement. The harassment that has followed his post has been frightening.It’s also proof that theTeslaTakedown campaign is working.I’d like to address the lies spread about me by the world’s richest man and X users. I have not committed any crimes. I have not been funded by ActBlue, or by George Soros – that name is simply a tired antisemitic dog whistle. I’m not inspired by Luigi Mangione nor have I ever said that I am. I am not encouraging any vandalism. Nobody is getting paid to come to these protests. I am not the leader of Tesla Takedown. In fact, no one is.If we can’t show our opposition to what the government is doing, then we’re living in a dictatorshipHere is the truth: Tesla Takedown is a completely decentralized movement with hundreds of protests taking place around the globe, drawing many thousands of people out of their homes and on to the public sidewalks to stand up for programs that support poor people, older people, veterans, the sick. Out of care and concern for others – a foreign concept to those currently in power – people are offering what they can to help. I’ve offered to schlep supplies, and helped someone find a bullhorn. The environmentally focused Seattle organization I’m a part of, Troublemakers, hosts a map where other people and groups can post the locations of forthcoming demonstrations. Troublemakers has about $3,500 in its bank accounts. All of this is a bare-bones, low-budget, people-powered movement – which is exactly why Musk is afraid of it, and casting about to find a villain.Trump calls Tesla boycott ‘illegal’ and says he’s buying one to support MuskRead moreThere are currently 91 Tesla Takedown protests planned across the world this coming weekend, and there will be more the weekend after that. If there isn’t one at the Tesla showroom nearest you, you can start one just by showing up with some friends or family, maybe making some cardboard signs. This exercise of our fundamental first amendment right to peaceably assemble is giving an effective outlet to the outrage this administration has caused here and around the globe, and we’re making a difference. Tesla stock has fallenprecipitously, losing a quarter of its value in the months since the protests began. On Wednesday, JP Morgan analysts told Quartz: “We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly.”Donald Trumpeven got on X this week to defensively claim thathe’ll be buying a Teslato support his good friend Musk. More and more people are unloading the company’s stock and selling their cars. The movement is growing and the administration is taking notice. When enough of us come together to do what we can, this is what effective opposition can be.Musk’s false accusations against me won’t stop this movement, because he is inflicting real harm on the American public and people around the world. In fact, Musk and Trump are the ones committing crimes. Just this week they have announced their intentions to slashsocial security,Medicare, unemployment insurance andfood stamps. They aregutting public institutions,stripping environmental protections,destabilizing the economyandpeople’s lives. Musk is openly and gleefullyfiring federal workersen masse and dismantling programs that serve millions at home and across the globe. They’ve ignored multiple judicial orders, and refused to restart payments that they were ordered to. The unofficial agency Musk leads, the “department of government efficiency”, is digging into systems and pushing out public servants, when its own staff hasn’t received so much as a background check. Musk’s conflicts of interest are piling up without any disclosures. All of the programs this administration is destroying are paid for by people like you and me through our taxes. Tesla – a billion-dollar company –shelled out zero income tax last year. Justice through government processes will be slow, if it comes at all.It might be a small consolation, but Elon Musk is getting poorer by the day | John NaughtonRead moreIf we can’t show our opposition to what the government is doing, we are living in a dictatorship. If we are criminalized for calling out the rich and powerful for their illegal actions, that is a dictatorship. I don’t want to live in a dictatorship.Make no mistake, it’s scary to be personally called out by the richest man in the world on the platform he owns. It’s scary to be targeted by a seemingly endless number of his devoted trolls and bots. To be doxxed, to have one’s life pored over and exposed, to be smeared, attacked and falsely accused. It’s scarier still when the FBI director gets tagged into the threads and asked to investigate. But I’m not backing down – and even if I did, it wouldn’t make a dent in this movement. Hundreds if not thousands of people have participated in the ways that I have.The truth is, the people are powerful. I’ve always believed that.

That Australia, as a country, believes in and benefits from trade being as free as possible.But what about some voluntary protectionism in the wake of the government’s failure to win an exemption fromDonald Trump’s tariffs? Not counter-tariffs of course – the government has ruled out that brand of retaliation. But it is looking to find ways to encourage consumers to buy locally produced products rather than defaulting to (often cheaper) imports.Anthony Albanese flags this will be a feature of the 25 March budget. All in the name of supporting “Team Australia”.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email“I would urge Australians, if they’re in a local shop, to look to buy Australian,” the prime minister said on Thursday. “That’s one way that consumers can assist to create jobs here and to support our local industries.”Despite the unfortunate circumstances in which it comes, this exhortation actually fits with the government’s pre-Trump policy ofFuture Made in Australia, with its incentives for projects especially in the clean energy area. Critics thought the policy was too interventionist, indeed protectionist. The government argued it was securing Australia’s place “in a changing global environment”.Peter Dutton’s work from home policy has many in Coalition ranks worriedRead moreJust as he seems to be wreaking havoc around the world, Donald Trump is now embedded in Australia’s domestic politics in the run-up to the election. Both sides are struggling to deal with the consequences of that.Albanese is trying to contain the damage of the exemption failure, while pinning the “Trumpist” label on Dutton, accusing him of being “a cheer squad” for the Trumpites. “He had a choice yesterday of backing in the Trump administration in this decision or backing Australia. He chose to not back Australia.”Dutton is attempting to exploit the government’s inability to sway Trump but duck the accusation of not being on the national team.The opposition says the tariff affair shows Albanese is weak, using this latest problem to feed into a general theme it is running about the PM. Dutton (though without evidence) claims he could get the Americans across the line. Kos Samaras from the political consultancy Redbridge, which does extensive research, says voters do think Dutton would be the better leader to deal with Trump.Dutton’s challenge on the tariff issue is to criticise the government while not appearing to exult in Australia’s misfortune. It’s just one of the fine lines the opposition leader is needing to walk at the moment.Dutton is tantalisingly close to power, but the last steps will be the hardest.A Newspoll finding published the week must give him cause for worry. More than half (55%) doubted the Coalition was ready for government. The poll found while this feeling was strongest among young voters, 61% of those aged 35 to 49 doubted its readiness.No wonder some Coalition MPs are worrying Dutton has left it too late to release and flesh out much of his policy,He contests claims of a policy vacuum, pointing to the nuclear policy, housing measures and some other initiatives.Nevertheless, because Dutton has run a basically small-target strategy (nuclearaside) there will be a feeling among some voters that in government he could be a surprise packet. We know more of what he is against than what he is for or what he would do.Many voters would recall Tony Abbott going out of his way to reassure people in the 2013 election campaign, and then unleashing the shock 2014 budget. A logical (and reasonable) question is, what would Dutton’s first budget be like?If Dutton wouldn’t act like Abbott, would he follow the example of John Howard, whom he highlights as a role model?Howard promised before the 1996 election that there’d “never ever” be a GST under him, then unveiled one (which he took to the following election).In such uncertain times, it will be particularly important for Dutton to reassure voters that they will get what they vote for, not something completely unexpected.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He told the Conversation’s podcast he thought this was “one of the most important areas”, and pointed to declining school completion rates and the need for a more back-to-basics approach.But what would this mean in detail? How much would he seek to impinge on the states, which have prime responsibility for government schooling?The more general point is that it is not clear whether Dutton would be an incrementalist or have his eyes on radical reform in government. Yet voters want more signals. Samaras says Dutton in recent weeks has been looking “flat-footed”, that he is not going to be able to get away with the small-target strategy. “He needs to build a case for change.”4:27Albanese's dating show, Peter Dutton has a soul, and Clive Palmer unveils his trumpet – videoIn some areas, the Coalition is leaning to potential heavy intervention. It has said it would break up supermarkets if they exploited their market power.More recently, Dutton has ventured further, saying (and re-confirming on the podcast) that insurance companies could also face divestiture.But on the insurance issue there has been open division and confusion.Some Liberals were unhappy with the supermarket divestiture policy, which was substantially driven by the Nationals.On insurance companies, shadow treasurer Angus Taylor and deputy leader Sussan Ley both asserted divestiture was not opposition policy, before Dutton brought the team into line.That raises another problem Dutton has. His team remains weak. Taylor still can’t stack up effectively against treasurer Jim Chalmers. This is a potential vulnerability in the election campaign.Politicians facing elections often liken their situation to climbing Everest. For Dutton the last stage will be treacherous.Michelle Grattan is a Professorial Fellow, University of Canberra.

Labour’s “new deal” employment programme was its 1997 flagship. Now those lessons, ignored and trashed in the Tory years, are being revived. WhileLabourwas good at scrupulously monitoring the results of its social programmes, the Tories ruled by their gut instincts.Faced with high unemployment and shocking numbers of youths who had been dumped and neglected, Labour’s new deal for young people worked. By 2002, it could rightly claim thevirtual eradication of youth long-term unemployment.I followed the programme in detail, sitting in on jobcentre interviews, chasing results. How was it done? A total change of attitude and approach, from punitive to encouraging. Employment staff were retrained and put on a higher grade, becoming personal advisers to help remove obstacles to working. They offered 18- to 24-year-olds four well-organised options: a further education course, work on environmental projects or in a voluntary organisation, or a subsidised job with employers given £60 a week to take them on. “No fifth option” was the backstop sanction. About 339,000 long-term unemployed young peoplefound work by 2001. Deep distrust of the Department for Work and Pensions faded, as people discovered genuine help. There were other new deals for the over-50s, disabled people, and a particularly successfulone for lone parents. Jobcentres were transformed from The Full Monty’s bolted-down plastic chairs and shouted interviews behind scratched Perspex to open, less threatening places.But by 2009, in the aftermath of the bankers’ crash, nearly 1 million young peoplelanded in jobcentres. Labour, determined not to see them become a lost generation, dashed to set up the future jobs fund. Employers were paid £6,500 to take an extra young person for six months, who were paid at least the minimum wage,creating 105,000 jobs. (A local panel, including unions, ensured the jobs were new, not substitutes.) I watched Jon, a depressed 19-year-old without qualifications who had despaired of work, amazed as his adviser in a Brighton jobcentre showed him all kinds of good jobs suddenly available. Cost-benefit analyses found people spent70 fewer days on benefitsand 43% were estimated to be in work after completing the programme – a high rate compared with other schemes, and well worth the high upfront cost. But the great George Osborne axe fell on this, as it did on so much else.Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, has for a long time talked up this approach: she knows the research well and, bludgeoning the Treasury with the evidence, has reportedlyextracted as much as £1bn for supporting disabled peopleinto work, as well as the1 million “neets”(young people aged 18-24 not in education, employment or training). That is a significant sum to spend on support programmes, say employment experts. It should create high-quality schemes. Kendall always promised more personal help by easing work coaches’ caseloads. She talks of the need to de-risk taking a job, so disabled people can trust they have the option to try a job but return at once to benefits if it doesn’t work out. Employers need to be more flexible with varying states of illness. She talks of no longer wasting time by harassing those who will never work, while neglecting many who could and want to. But here’s the hitch: actual cash returns will take time to score on the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) and Treasury balance sheets.The great question is: how big an axe will fall on disability benefits whenshe delivers her green papernext week? And, more importantly, how fast? Over time, if schemes work and if the economy perks up, then reducing the number of claims and their costs is possible. But cuts before that success will be brutal. What’s more, aseconomist Jonathan Portes points out, OBR reports show its forecast disability cuts never actually add up. For example, introducing Pip was supposed to be a cut, replacing the disability living allowance; OBR duly scored it, but Pip costs ballooned. Even in the time of truly vicious jobcentre persecution of claimants with sanctions,punishment didn’t work. Chivvying may urge some people into work, but research shows it has thecontrary effect on those with mental ill-health.Squeezing over here bursts out elsewhere, in a half-starved system. With basic unemployment pay at a sub-survivable £393.45 a month, anyone out of work for long is in a miserable state, and likely to describe their condition in medicalised terms. That’s not cheating; it’s a true expression when they apply for disability benefits that lift them above starvation. The country is sicker than it was, and sicker than its neighbours, physically and mentally, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) reports this week, with nearly 1 million more people ondisability benefits than pre-pandemic. It’s not imaginary, they say, as it matches the rise in “deaths of despair”, from drugs, drink and suicide.Jobs arefar harsher than they once were, Prof Ben Baumberg Geiger reports – physically and emotionally more stressful, with less personal control. Efficiency savings have killed off “light work” for frailer people. What Labour does may help: a better NHS, less monstrous gig-working conditions and a better spirit of care. But any savage axe to living standards of hard-up disabled people wouldn’t encourage that. Labour would face a hefty backlash.Nor will voters approve, with 53% saying these benefits are too mean or about right, and only 26% saying they are too high.No wonder disability benefits costs terrify the Treasury, and they are due torise by £35bnin four years time. But here are alternative facts, equally true, if you shake the statistics kaleidoscope another way.The overall proportion of spending on benefits for working age adults and children is similar to 20 years ago, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation told me. And here’s anothershake of the kaleidoscopefrom the IFS: the UK’s spending on working-age health-related benefits is comparable to that of other similar countries.There are no easy billions to be had from the benefits budget, though much reform is needed within it. Look elsewhere: Starmerabolishing NHS Englandshould render savings from this costly duplicate. Whitehall should shed extra staff acquired in Covid. But there are few painless options for large sums, as all the economic choices are terrible. But of all unpalatable ways for Labour to break its election promises, either by borrowing or by taxing more, the worst choice of all would be cuts and austerity, slicing deeper into public services.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It locks homeowners, especially those in flats, into an exploitative, serf-like relationship with the freeholder who owns the property and management rights to it.The freeholder can exploit this power imbalance and, with the backing of the law, coerce the leaseholder to pay extortionate sums in ground rent and service charges. The former is a payment conferring no benefit or service to leaseholders, it is owed as tribute to the freeholder’s superior legal rights. Historically a trivial amount, ground rent has been gamed in recent years to extort more money from individual leaseholders. So destructive are ground rents that in 2022,parliament passed a lawbanning them on new homes.The freeholder also appoints a building management company to handle maintenance, funded by a service charge levied on flat owners. In practice, this can lead to conflicts of interest and exorbitant fees. If leaseholders fail to meet demands for a payment above £350 they can face their home being claimed without compensation. The threat of forfeiture forces leaseholders to pay inflated fees – sometimes for services never received.I’ve seen leaseholder exploitation at first-hand.My mum’s service charges to her freeholder have risen to an obscene £33,000 annually, as the no-frills building deteriorates and homes are rendered unsaleable.Hamptonsfound that in 2023 alone, leaseholders in England and Wales paid a punishing £7.6bn in service charges. A 2011 study by Which? estimated leaseholders were being overcharged by £700m every year through inflated service charges. A recent governmentimpact assessmentconsidered this figure to be too low due to growth of the sector. Growing awareness of leasehold’s exploitative nature has widened the price gap between houses and flats. This gap is now at a30-year highwith buyers unwilling to become financial hostages.The government’s newcommonhold white paperpromises to ban leasehold for future flats. New flats would be “commonhold”, a democratic structure whereby each flat-owner owns the freehold to their unit and, through a company, owns a share of the land with their neighbours. Commonholders would appoint their own managing agent and collectively decide how their money is spent. They would be free from ground rents and the risk of forfeiture.However, the government has not committed to providing an assured pathway to commonhold for the millions, like my mum, already in leasehold flats. The proposals expect leaseholders to acquire the freehold before converting to commonhold. However, freehold purchase is extortionate, often costing tens of thousands of pounds a household. The government has suggested this won’t change, stating “the cost is likely to still be significant”. Labour has ruled out government-backed loans for commonhold conversion, a majorLaw Commission recommendation.View image in fullscreenA block of flats in London.Photograph: Toddlerstock/AlamyBeyond cost, many leaseholders are blocked from buying their freehold due torestrictions imposedby the Tories in the 1990s. Labour appears set to replicate these exclusions in their rules on who can acquire their freehold and convert to commonhold. These include the lack of a statutory right for leaseholders to retrospectively buy their freehold share if they did not participate in the original freehold buy-out with their neighbours, either because they couldn’t afford to or hadn’t yet bought into the development. Another exclusion harms leaseholders in flats structurally connected to commercial premises such as a shop.Under the proposals, even qualifying leaseholders who secure majority support for commonholdwon’t be totally free of leasehold. Currently, the process requires 100% support from the leaseholders, lenders and freeholder. Although the government signals it will reduce the participation threshold to 50%, and ensure that only leaseholders decide, pure commonhold will only be secured if every single leaseholder votes and pays for it upfront.Given that this is near impossible, commonhold will coexist with leasehold within individual buildings, potentially resulting in costly administration, disputes and even litigation. Why adopt a policy that the government itself recognises “might prove worse than the leasehold it replaced”?The government’s half-baked intervention risks creating a new two-tier market, divided between shiny new commonhold flats and the legacy stock of leasehold debt traps. Elsewhere in the world, including in Scotland, flat-owners enjoy democratic self-rule without third-party landlords; it’s time we extended these rights to the rest of the UK – and that means commonhold for the many, not just the new.Harry Scoffin is a housing campaigner and the founder of Free LeaseholdersExplore more on these topicsLeaseholdOpinionPropertyHousingCommunitiesLabourEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

Insularity is the name of the game with both – you have to spend a lot of time inside, not really talking to people, trapped totally in your own head.For some time now, the solution to this problem has been my rat, Bob. I’ve had him for two years, and in that time he has been my sounding board, creative confidant and unwavering ally. I’ve written two books with him in the room and I am certain he knows when I’m writing, because he has to deal with me hugging him more, as I try to take breaks from the cruel demands of a first draft.Everyone asks me about my plans for having children. A nest of noisy miner birds has taught me how to respond | Joseph EarpRead moreI am aware what this all sounds like – becoming a rat guy is not, on the face of it, a means of becoming less weird. The filmRatatouilleaside, most of the mainstream representation that rats get is as harbingers of death and destruction, so keeping a little dude in your house whose largest contribution to society is the bubonicplague admittedly lies on the stranger side of pet ownership.But here’s the thing: Bob is my son. He is kind, cuddly, stubborn and wilful. Even people who don’t like rats are moved by him. He’s never even bitten anyone, except my friend Susie, who dared to talk to him when he was gnawing on a cucumber.More than anything else, Bob adores two things: his wheel, and me. (The order of those things is deliberate – I know he’d jump over my dying body for one more hit of the wheel, and that’s fine.) For much of our time together, when I have picked him up, he has stuck out his little ratty hands and asked to grab my hair, which he will then carefully preen. When I googled this behaviour, I discovered it meant that he considered me one of his brood. So we are on the same page: I think he’s my kid and he thinks I’m his too.The animals who live in our home are little scraps of a universe and natural world so much larger, and more complicated, than usAsk any rat person (go ahead, we don’t bite, unless we’re eating cucumber) and you will learn that rats are smart, funny, affectionate and sweet. Probe a little deeper and you will also quickly unearth heartbreak. Rats live for two years. You form a deep bond with them, get used to their constant chatter and then they get wrenched away from you.Because Bob is a remarkable rat, I always assumed he would defy the odds on the issue of mortality, and that in 10 years time he’d be sauntering around with a cane, writing his memoirs, old but not gone. About six months ago though, it became unignorable that he had slowed down. He doesn’t run in his wheel much, if ever, any more. If I pick him up, he settles into my arms and makes little chittering noises that indicate he’s happy.But the days of him preening my hair are mostly gone. If I hold him up to my head, he weakly, gently, runs his little hands through my hair. I like to imagine his mind is willing but his body is not – that he wants me to know how much he still loves me but his joints are too stiff now to show it. He can’t tell me either way.My mentor John Hughes taught me how to write. Then he plagiarised my work | Joseph EarpRead moreThis is one of the remarkable things about pets: we understand them totally, except for the striking times when we really don’t. Owning and caring for a creature takes us outside of ourselves – not just us insular weirdo artists, but all people. The animals who live in our home are little scraps of a universe and natural world so much larger, and more complicated, than us. That we can understand them at all is remarkable and beautiful. The times when we can’t understand them, and we remember that they are so profoundly different to us, is remarkable and beautiful too.We exist with our pets in a strange, wonderful middle point, a meeting ground between species. I never stopped being a person. Bob never stopped being a rat. But we became each other’s little one. We looked out for each other.Each day now, I give Bob a cuddle and try to work out what might be going on for him. There’ll be a time soon when the pain is too much and it’ll be time for him to go. Will I know it? I like to believe I will. And in the meantime, I’ll be sitting here with a little cuddly scrap of the universe in my lap, thanking him for what he’s given me and assuring him I will be OK, even if I have to brush my own hair when he’s gone.Joseph Earp is a critic, painter and novelist.

Or is there more benefit in allying with Donald Trump?Thu 13 Mar 2025 06.13 EDTLast modified on Thu 13 Mar 2025 11.11 EDTShareAt this stage of the crisis, it is important to be clear-sighted. The US-Ukraine meeting in Jeddah was a damage-control operation.Both parties reset relationsthat had been damaged, largely by Washington’s impatience. The US reversed its previous decisions in exchange for something Ukraine was ready to provide anyway: privileged access to Ukraine’s natural resource wealth and a willingness to start a peace process.It is encouraging to see renewed US-Ukraine dialogue to end the war.As Churchill said, the only thing worse than fighting with allies is fighting without them.The public mugging in the Oval Office, calling Volodymyr Zelenskyy a dictator and the pause in military and intelligence support were hard to fathom. Ukrainians wondered why President Trump was putting the blame and the pressure on the victim, and protecting the aggressor. Trump’s “beautiful” deal involved bullying the weaker and reassuring the stronger. He finds it more natural to put pressure on allies, be it Ukraine or Canada, and relax it on adversaries.This week’s meeting in Jeddah may have been an effort by the White House to re-balance the pressure scale and expose Vladimir Putin’s real intentions. By the beginning of this week the US hadlifted the pause on intelligence-sharingand resumed security assistance. This intelligence is critical for defending Ukrainian cities from the nightly aerial bombings. US satellite images and communication systems sustain several targeting and air-defence platforms. The night the delegations met in Saudi Arabia, the port ofOdesa was hit, killing four people in a strike on a grain vessel. Ukraine is waging a defensive war and perhaps the White House has understood that the best leverage over Putin is powerful and well-equipped Ukrainian armed forces.Nobody wants peace more than Ukraine.When President Trump was accusingZelenskyy of not wanting peace, it must have pleased the Kremlin immensely. Trump was reciting Russian talking points. The US-Ukraine meeting dispelled that falsehood and demonstrated Kyiv’s constructive and cooperative position.View image in fullscreenIryna Petrochenko looks out from her damaged apartment in Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine, after a Russian missile attack killed one and wounded nine on 12 March 2025.Photograph: Paula Bronstein/Getty ImagesThe joint statementpoints out that “Ukraine expressed a readiness to accept the US proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation”.So what will be Putin’s move? I think his agreement on a ceasefire will be driven by two factors: whether his country can stay in the fight for much longer and the terms of the arrangement imposed onUkraine. Putin may decide that the cost of losing a seat at the superpower table with the US president outweighs any benefits of conquering a few more villages in eastern Ukraine. Putin may, therefore, settle for a ceasefire that secures his interim gains: he gets his “grey zone” with a weakened Ukraine outside Nato and an unresolved war that can be reignited at any time. This would mean Ukraine would need to continue to spend a huge portion of its national budget on defence, straining its economy and struggling to deliver on the EU integration agenda. Putin, meanwhile, gets a secure “land bridge” connecting Crimea to Russia via the coast of the Azov Sea.A ceasefire would bring Russia much-needed economic relief and buy time for a military reconstitution. Given Ukraine’s persistent destruction of Russian oil refineries, it will need time to rebuild those too. For this, the lifting of energy-related western sanctions will be key to get new equipment in. And a pause allows for regrouping of manpower, since Ukraine has killed or woundednearly 80% of the ground troops that Russia has mobilised for this war. Russia has struggled to take large chunks of Ukraine because of a deficit of men and equipment.The final incentive to pause the war may come from Putin’s confidence in his ability to wreck Ukraine from within. Recent US insistence on elections and calls for Zelenskyy to resign are also part of the Kremlin’s plans.Putin is determined to destroy Zelesnkyy’s government. The grey zone scenario enables the forces of chaos, fuelled by disinformation, to damage pro-democratic parties. The blame for this neither-war-nor-peace situation will fall on Zelenskyy. Issues of war trauma, lack of foreign investment and new outflows of people when travel restrictions are lifted make a ceasefire risky for Ukraine. A ceasefire that doesn’t lead to a just settlement will worsen regional security in the long run.View image in fullscreenRussian artist Alexey Sergienko’s artwork titled The Peace (2017) on display in St Petersburg, Russia, 12 March 2025.Photograph: Anatoly Maltsev/EPAUkraine may not “have all the cards”, but nor is it bluffing when it says it will not capitulate to Moscow’s demands.Support for Zelenskyy remains high. Despite its own difficulties with military personnel, only 38% of Ukrainians believe Kyiv should agree to relinquish Ukraine’s sovereign territory to Russia. This is mainly driven by the understanding that Russia is waging a genocidal war to destroy the Ukrainian nation –87% of Ukrainians believe Moscow will not stop at the current frontlines.If the US manages to curtail Russian appetites and pressure it to approach a ceasefire as the start of a genuine settlement, peace has a chance. If not, it will create a quagmire that will sink Ukraine and further weaken the rest of Europe. Moscow isalready in a non-kinetic war with the west; butwestern intelligence assessmentsshow it is preparing for a “hot”, conventional conflict.

Hertfordshire zoo offers a World of Dinosaurs, there is the “roarsome” theatre show Dinosaur World: Live, a dinosaur-themed park in Norfolk called ROARR!, Dinosaur World in Torquay, Dinosaur Park near Swansea, Dino Park in Dumfries – the list is as long as the neck of a brontosaurus.Parents will have noticed that unicorns are equally ubiquitous, and marketed exclusively and equally extensively to little girls, usually swathed in pink. Historically, unicorns are a symbol of purity, grace and innocence; their horns are said to be able to heal people and purify poisoned water.There is no evidence that unicorns ever existed – at leastnot those creaturesof the popular imagination – and dinosaurs aren’t around much lately either; it’s almost as if someone doesn’t want our children to become interested in animals that are actually alive.I know children who can list 10 different types of dinosaur but don’t know the difference between anAfrican elephantand an Indian elephant. I know children who believe unicorns are real, but don’t realise that as many as 1,500 ponies live wild onDartmoor. Children go to bed hugging a toy unicorn, but have never sat on the back of a pony. How many of our children are going to want to grow up to be naturalists or environmentalists if they aren’t taught about real animals?My message to parents, grandparents, aunties, uncles, brothers and sisters is: if you want to introduce our tiny humans to animals, please buy them a book about aardvarks, brown kiwi, ring-tailed lemurs, crested porcupines or hippopotamuses. Across Europe, brown bears are beingsuccessfully reintroduced; what a thrilling piece of news to hook in a child’s interest.View image in fullscreenA pair of Eurasian beavers.Photograph: Arterra Picture Library/AlamyAnd it doesn’t have to be bears.Beavers are fantastic little mammalsto learn about: they have gorgeous tails, build little dome-shaped dens called “lodges”, gnaw down trees, build dams, reroute rivers, and create whole new ecosystems. Under anew government licence scheme,they are being returned to waterways in England – so it’s not wildly misleading to teach children that, if they are patient, they might see one swimming along with a stick.There are other great stories about British wildlife to tell: some naturalists, for example, hope to see the reintroduction of the beautiful grey wolf to our shores. There is a role available, in the future, for the first person to successfully reintroduce a pair of wolves to Britain, ashas been doneacross Europe. Maybe that child is alive now. So if you are a parent, please talk to your child about wolves.If they want monsters, tell them about theGila monsterthat lives in Mexico and the south-western US. If they want magic, tell them about chameleons that are alive now in Madagascar and can change colour. Tell them about beautifulpeacock spiders, whose eight eyes are so big that they take up almost their entire heads.The awe-inspiring intelligence of octopuses – podcastRead moreIf children become curious about insects, they won’t grow up with a fear of them. If you show children how intelligent octopuses are, when they are adults maybe they will choose not to eat them. If you tell them stories of orange orangutans then maybe as adults they will want to visit Borneo and play a part in protecting the rainforests – or at least they will avoid buyingpalm oil. If you want to start nearer home, maybe you know someone who has hedgehogs in their garden, snuffling around at dusk?I’m begging those of you that are looking after the next generation: put a picture of a bottlenose dolphin on the wall, or a moose, a porcupine, a gorilla, or a penguin.

That  money would be better spent fighting the climate crisisThu 13 Mar 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 13 Mar 2025 11.04 EDTShareThings could be worse for Rachel Reeves, but not much. The economy is stagnant. Donald Trump has decided the UK will not beexempt from tariffson steel and aluminium exports to the US. Stock markets have taken fright andshare prices are tumbling.Five years on from the start of the Covid-19 lockdown, the scars of the pandemic have proved to be deep and long-lasting. The spring statement on the economy that Reeves will deliver later this month will announcecuts to welfarein order to prevent the government breaking its own borrowing rules.Echoes of the 1920s and 1930s are everywhere. The return of protectionism is but one way in which the years between the first and second world wars are being reprised. Just as the 1920s saw failed attempts to turn the clock back to a world economy overseen by the gold standard, so for more than a decade and a half central banks and finance ministries have been seeking a return to the rapid growth of the 1990s and early 2000s.As in the interwar years, the multilateral system is being weakened by US isolationism. Middle-ranking European powers such as Britain and France are being asked to shoulder the burden of collective security. As then, there is a sense of liberal values being under threat. Ukraine is the new Czechoslovakia and I see Vladimir Putin as the new Hitler – to be appeased at Europe’s peril. The peace dividend – higher social spending paid for by spending an ever smaller share of national income on tanks, planes and ships – is considered to be a thing of the past.There has been no repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s – at least not yet – but there is no real sign that a long period of ultra-low interest rates has resulted in stronger economic growth. But in the past month, a new narrative has developed. Countries such as Britain will, as a result of Trump’s reticence about deploying US power for the defence of Europe, have to increase military spending. Theboost to the defence budgetwill help the government’s growth agenda because the extra money will provide a stimulus. After all, didn’t khaki Keynesianism eventually bring about full employment and the end of the depression?If this all sounds like too pat an explanation, that’s because it is. Given that nothing else has worked, it was perhaps inevitable that sooner or later policymakers would eventually alight on arms spending as the cure for stagnation, but the idea that there can be a return to the 1939-45 war economy is a fantasy.For one thing, the evidence of the late 1930s and early 1940s suggests that the current government’s plans are insufficient either to boost growth significantly or prepare the UK to fight a major continental war.Defence spending rosefrom 2.2% of GDP in 1933, the year Hitler came to power, to 6.9% in 1938 when Neville Chamberlain signed the Munich agreement.At its peak in 1944, defence spending accounted for half the UK’s national output. Keir Starmer hasraided the aid budgetto pay for defence spending to be raised from 2.3% to 2.5% of GDP and has the aspiration of further increasing it to 3% of GDP, but these are modest increases.Then there’s the question of how the extra defence spending is to be financed. During the second world war, this was done through a combination of borrowing, taxation and rationing. The national debt rose to 250% of GDP, while the need to divert resources into armaments meant there had to be a squeeze on consumer spending. Without higher taxation and rationing, an overheating economy would have suffered runaway inflation.Military spending is touted as a remedy for Britain’s ailing economy. Here’s why it won’t work | Khem RogalyRead moreThe stance being adopted by Reeves is different. The chancellor is not prepared to break her fiscal rules to pay for higher defence spending, so extra borrowing is not an option. That leaves her with a choice of either further increases in taxation or cuts in spending. It is not just that there is no longer a peace dividend; rather, the peace dividend will go into reverse, with cuts to the peacetime economy paying for additional military spending.Germany is planning to ease its borrowing rules, which means its rearmament will have an impact on growth, but Britain is not. There will be no change to the size of the UK economy or its growth rate, and the government’s attempt to suggest otherwise is nonsense.All that said, the debate about military Keynesianism matters because it proves resources can always be found if the need is considered great enough. When faced with a crisis, governments can always come up with the money. There were three chancellors of the exchequer between 1939 and 1945, all peripheral figures, and that’s because, first, national survival and then the pursuit of victory meant fiscal rules were ditched and the influence of the Treasury diminished.While Starmer harks back to this era with his talk of the economic benefits of higher defence spending, he is really offering military Keynesianism-lite. What’s more, the climate crisis poses a bigger existential threat to this country than Putin does – or ever will, so if money can be found for the military there’s no reason why it couldn’t also be found to accelerate the drive for self-sufficiency in clean energy. That might really do something for national security.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsEconomic policyOpinionRachel ReevesKeir StarmerDefence policyTrade policyLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

The PM wants effective, dynamic administration that voters will believe inThu 13 Mar 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 13 Mar 2025 07.44 EDTShareWhen Keir Starmer’s government finally arrives on the threshold of the next general election, due in 2028-29, Labour’s hopes will not rest on the battlefields of Ukraine, however well-judged Starmer’s diplomacy is proving to be in that conflict right now. Labour’s long-term fate will instead be determined here at home, in the way all elections almost always are.As so often, the outcome in four years’ time will be decided by whether voters feel more secure then than they did in the past. If they do, they may vote Labour. If they do not, they may turn to the Conservatives and to Reform UK. The government’s preoccupation with this crossroads explains why Downing Street wants the prime minister’sspeech on the civil serviceon Thursday to be seen as a defining choice of direction.In his speech, Starmer is expected to set out plans for the most radical restructuring of the British state in decades. The plans are said to be extensive, challenging old assumptions of the right and the left, and ranging far beyond the old argument about the size of the state that dominated British politics in the 40 years after Margaret Thatcher came to power. Many previous reform strategies, most recently from Michael Gove, have fizzled out. With his large majority, however, Starmer is particularly well placed to turn his proposals into reality.Starmer’s central contention is that, although the civil service today is larger than ever, it is far less effective and trusted. His spotlight ranges well beyond Whitehall.More than 5 million peopleare now employed in central and local government service, including the NHS: around a million more than in 2000. Partly because of Covid,four times as manywork in NHS England and the department of health compared with 2010, when waiting lists were shortest andpublic satisfaction highest.Cutting numbers, however, is only one of the expected Starmer plans. The prime minister will also announce new incentives to get“failing” civil servants to quit, a thinning-out of top jobs in Whitehall, aslowdown in outsourcingfrom government departments to regulators, a reorganisation of NHS England, and a big boost for data roles and AI.‘Country first, party second,’ says Starmer. So why menace Labour members who actually believe that? | Polly ToynbeeRead moreThe advance billing of Starmer’s address on Thursday as a speech on civil service reform may have served to obscure its wider significance. The reality, though, is that it is about something truly epic. It is about whetherLabourcan make 21st-century British government work at all.Until the speech itself is delivered, the key text for understanding what Starmer thinks he is doing remains the1,500-word letterthat he wrote to cabinet ministers last month. That letter, which clearly reflects the approach of the No 10 chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, was a call to arms for the remainder of this parliament. It said the old ways have failed and are too slow. Politicians have become “complacent about the role of the market and the state”. The public is “hungry for change and disruption”. The letter ends with a demand for “wholesale reform” to provide security and renewal.Today’s intervention needs to be understood in that ambitious context. It is meant as big-picture stuff. It is not solely about changing Whitehall, civil service numbers or AI, though it is partly about all of that. At its root, though, the speech is about the imperative to change how government works in the new technological world. This was something that Dominic Cummings attempted from the centre-right after 2019. The aim this time is from the centre left, to make the state better at doing good for those who rely on it – which, in one way or another, is most of us.There should be no dispute that this is necessary work.A YouGov survey last autumnfound that just 6% thought UK public services were in a good state, with 74% judging them in a bad one. Bad management was seen as the number one cause, not lack of spending.Part of this is down to Brexit, which, far from cutting red tape as pretended, has actually increased it. Covid provided another extreme pressure. Yet, with civil service numbers now more than115,000 higher than before Brexit, there is no compelling sign that more civil servants leads to better outcomes. Better performance management in the civil service is a no-brainer when the public finances are tight, as they are today.Government sources are adamant that – despite the “project chainsaw” label others have given the initiative – it is wrong to equate what Starmer is saying with Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” in Washington. “We are not Doge. We are not wielding a chainsaw. We are not anti-state,” one said. “This is a centre-left Labour government. It believes in the power of the state to make lives better. But the state has to change. Civil servants need to realise that they will never have a more civil-service-supporting set of ministers than they do today.”This is the line that both Starmer and McSweeney take. The influential cabinet minister Pat McFadden also made these arguments on hisweekend media round. But the test of any policy and any speech is whether it can be put into practice as smoothly as possible and whether it produces desirable results for citizens. Here, the government faces big problems.Not least of these is the sheer amount of publicity given to Musk and to Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, for their iconic slash-and-burn,chainsaw-brandishing approachto government. Milei and Musk are opposed to the state, while Labour says it is not. Yet it can be all too easy to equate them, as even the Labour Together thinktank, which is close to McSweeney, has now done.Even if the parallels are fundamentally false, as McFadden argued this weekend, such comparisons can stick. They can be a gift to campaigners against the policy, including in the unions. These are deeply emotive issues, and for good reasons.Nevertheless, everyone, including the unions, also knows that the world has changed since the 20th century. The private sector is being transformed by new technologies bringing new forms of product manufacture, delivery, work and consumption. The public realm cannot sit by and pretend it is unaffected, or that there is some magical way of recreating the past.Starmer’s letter to the cabinet last month was run through with two ideas: the case for disruption of old approaches, and the public’s craving for better security. Disruption and security are not natural bedfellows. Starmer’s challenge is to prove that they can be. If he succeeds, Labour can look forward to the next election with something like cautious optimism. If he fails, the future will surely belong to others.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsCivil serviceOpinionLabourKeir StarmerNHSMorgan McSweeneyHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

The “petitions” sought parliamentary intervention after the Menzies government excised a portion of the Arnhem Land Reserve and covertly issued licences to a French company to mine bauxite on Yolŋu land. The text of the petitions was typed in English and Yolŋumatha(language) and stuck on to stringy-bark frames painted with the traditional signs and symbols that, if you knew how to read them, proclaimed Yolŋu sovereignty.Though a precocious student at the Yirrkala Methodist mission school, Yunupiŋu was deemed too young to be a signatory by the clan elders, including his father, Mungurruway. That task was appointed by the ŋärra – Yolŋu parliament – to nine men and three women between the age of 18 and 36, literate representatives of the 17 clans of the Yolŋu nation who were sending their bark emissaries to the federal capital of the Australian nation.This unique act of political diplomacy did not attempt to block mining but instead sought three outcomes fundamental to Yolŋu law: consultation before coming on to land; consent before taking any resources from that land; and compensation for any resources extracted. Yolŋu had to abide with these laws in respect of their own territorial clan borders. Macassan traders had been complying with such Yolŋu domestic and foreign policy regulations for centuries.Indigenous leaders celebrate as court rejects appeal in landmark Yunupingu compensation caseRead moreYunupiŋu’s name mightn’t have been written on the bark but his quick, curious eyes were trained on his elders’ dignified attempt at agreement-making with the commonwealth, his searching face looking up to the future. Indeed, when the principal of the Yirrkala mission school held a mock election in mid-1963, ahead of the federal election that Menzies would contest later that year with a knife-edge, one-seat majority – and the first election in whichIndigenous Australianswould enjoy the federal franchise – Yunupiŋu was voted prime minister by his student peers.Three years later, Yunupiŋu was one of only a handful of Yolŋu boys sent away to bible school in Brisbane. Did he want to go into the church, become a minister? I asked him in a series of conversations we conducted in his home on the Gumatj homelands at Gunyaŋgara in 2021, marooned in his beloved Jason recliner chair, one leg short after kidney disease had extracted its rueful price. (He called what we were doing over those weeksŋarraku dhäwu landrightsbuy– telling “my land rights story”.)No, he told me. He went to Brisbane to learn about “the games that they played”. Why? “To look after the elders.” Yunupiŋu wanted to learn how leadership in the white world worked. His ambition, he said, was not to join them, but to know their game so as to beat them at it, fair and square. To do this he needed to learn how to be a leader “in both ways”. To live in two worlds. But he was crystal-clear on one score: his two-ways education was necessary to protect and defend “the oldest way, the Yolŋu way”.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe generous gift of the Näku Dhäruk | Bark Petitions having been rejected and the Menzies government re-installed in a landslide, Yunupiŋu first put his vigilance to work in acting as translator for his father and other elders in Milirrpum v Nabalco, known as the Gove land rights case. Handing down his decision in 1971 – and despite the repeat diplomacy of the elders giving him unprecedented access to their secret sacred knowledge of country – Justice Blackburn rejected the notion of native title.In 2019, over half a century after Mungurruway and other clan leaders first asked for a voice in the decisions being made about their country and fate, Yunupiŋu lobbed the land rights ball back in the federal court. On behalf of the Gumatj people, he launched a claim for compensation over the impact of five decades of mining on lands which, he argued, had not been acquired under just terms. (“Just terms”, it seems, being a legal precept of both the Australian constitution and Yolŋurom/law.)The federal court found in Yunupiŋu’s favour but the commonwealth was not prepared to concede just yet. The Labor government – appearing to want to turn back the sands that Whitlam began pouring into Vincent Lingiari’s open hand in 1975, a legal hourglass flipped – appealed to the high court.Like Eddie Mabo, who did not live to see the court decision that would overturn the legal fiction ofterra nulliusby which Australia’s First Nations had been dispossessed of their land – their sovereignty breached and their property stolen – Yunupiŋu was not in the high court of Australia to see the government’s appeal quashed. He passed away in April 2023.Outside the court, Djawa Yunupiŋu saluted his late older brother as the “mastermind” behind the endeavour to safeguard the future of his people.“He was the one who had the vision,” Djawa said.As a watchful, reverent teenager, Yunupiŋu determined to master the white man’s game. He played for his ancestors, his elders, his children and his grandchildren. He played hard. He played the long game.On Wednesday, the high court of Australiafinally declared game over.“Native title recognises that, according to their laws and customs, Indigenous Australians have a connection with country,” the judgment read.“It is a connection which existed and persisted before and beyond settlement, before and beyond the assertion of sovereignty and before and beyond federation.”“It is older and deeper than the constitution.”In one of our interview sessions, Yunupiŋu proposed a historical hypothetical: what if Blackburn had to face Yolŋu law? Would the scales of Yolŋu justice weigh in his favour? What would a Makarrata process have looked like for a man who had not listened to and respected the elders?Yunupiŋu gameplanned this idea for a while, animated, fire in his eyes. He concluded: “Everybody stands in front of the law. No one escapes judgment.”“A judgment once and for all.”Clare Wright is professor of history at La Trobe University.

But – given the enduring and increasingly scandalous horrors those victims are facing in a country whose appallingly flawed legal approach haseffectively decriminalised the act– someone’s got to do it.This time it is Stacey Dooley’s job. The two-part documentary Rape on Trial focuses on the difficulties presented by cases in which the supposed perpetrator and victim are known to each other. It also looks at the suffering caused by the ever-lengthening delays between rapes being reported and reaching trial, in the surpassingly rare instance (despite recent efforts to improve matters) that the Crown Prosecution Service agrees to let them proceed. The documentary was slated to take a year to film – it ended up taking three, so slow was the progress on any of the cases its makers were following.Dooley deploys her natural talent for exuding a kind of stalwart sympathy as she interviews three women who all knew the men they say raped them, as they wait for their cases to be heard. Jessie (all the women have waived their right to anonymity and appear on camera) endured, she says, repeated unwanted sex from her much older boyfriend when she was a teenager. (“I would wake up with him inside me.”) It is four years from the time of her reporting the rape to getting a verdict. In the meantime, he is out on bail and Jessie frequently sees him around town, and working near her house. Jessie’s mother, Michelle, says that her daughter has become all but unrecognisable under the strain. “She means everything to me, that girl, and I just want her back.” Jessie’s is a rare case in that she has additional witnesses, including a former girlfriend of the defendant and another woman who each say he raped them too. Will three women’s word against one man’s be enough to win what one defence solicitor calls “the credibility battle” in court? How much does it take to persuade a jury not just that you are telling the truth but to meet the required standard of proof – that the accused could have had no reasonable belief in consent?Emma says she was orally raped at 16 by a classmate in college. Until then, she says, she thought “to be frozen with fear” was just an expression. “You can’t move. You don’t believe it, but it’s true.” Her mum persuaded her to report him to the police. The trial has been postponed three times. “I’ve just got to do it because if not I’ll regret it for the rest of my life … even though I’m dying inside.” She has been suicidal – a woman once intervened as she was attempting to kill herself. After that, Emma’s father slept in a sleeping bag in front of the front door every night so they could keep her safe. In cross-examination, the defence suggests she has made the whole thing up because she was in love with the popular, wealthy accused. Emma is 19 before she gets a verdict. As she sobs uncontrollably in its wake, her mother puts her arms around her and stares dry-eyed into an incomprehensible future.Becca says she was raped by a man she was dating at university. “I felt like I knew him, then in that moment I realised I didn’t know him at all.” She waits three and a half years for the trial, before which she is advised by the witness service team to wear muted colours and keep her shoulders covered. The defence suggests that Becca, as a former drama student, has made up her story for effect.Dooley is the right person for the emotional parts – straightforward, unobtrusive and safe without being soft. But she is underpowered in the interviews with others, such as the deputy national lead on rape and serious sexual offences, Siobhan Blake, and defence lawyers who represent alleged rapists.It will, as Jessie – incandescent with fury alongside her misery – hopes, heighten awareness of the problems faced by claimants who enter this profoundly flawed system and the endemic biases that greet them from every quarter. But it is hard to admire a documentary that doesn’t also move the conversation on. This could be done by proffering some possible answers to what can be done to redress inbred prejudices that accompany he said/she said trials in which there is no forensic or other evidence. Or by interviewing people who have some idea of what reforms can be made to the law, examining what difference further funding could make, or how we change a culture in which disbelief of rape claims is/seems to be the default position. .It is difficult to feel anything very much apart from profound admiration for the women involved, and the loving people who support them, and a profound despair at their suffering – and that which is still to come.Stacey Dooley: Rape on Trial aired on BBC Three and is on iPlayer.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Chic – Dance Dance Dance (Yowsa Yowsa Yowsa) (1977)Taking inspiration from the 1930s was a disco trope – check Dr Buzzard’s Original Savannah Band’s swing-infused debut album or Carrie Lucas’s fabulous Tic Toc – but Dance Dance Dance’s re-appropriation of bandleader Ben Bernie’s catchphrase “yowsa yowsa yowsa!” was the most successful example of the lot: that it was aligned to a killer groove helped.18. Norma Jean – Saturday (1978)The eponymous solo album by Chic’s former vocalist is the great overlooked Rodgers and Edwards production of their golden era. Saturday perfectly evokes the anticipation before a night out, but doesn’t skirt the drudgery a night out provides escape from. Currently the theme to Ant and Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway, which rather misses the point.17. Chic – Soup for One (1982)Good tracks are scattered across Chic’s unloved 80s albums, but Soup for One is their last unequivocal classic: spacier and synth-ier than their 70s output, there’s a hint of the electronic boogie sound prominent in contemporary New York clubs. Its riff will be immediately familiar to latterday listeners thanks to the sample on Modjo’s 2000 chart-topper Lady.View image in fullscreenBernard Edwards and Nile Rogers in a New York recording studio in 1981.Photograph: Allan Tannenbaum/Getty Images16. Madonna – Like a Virgin (1984)The album that turned Madonna into a superstar was evidence of both Rodgers’ hitmaking nous and his adaptability as a producer. Its modish synth-heavy sound bore no resemblance to Chic … almost. Listen closely to the title track and you can hear his trademark staccato guitar driving the whole thing along.15. Chic – At Last I Am Free (1978)Chic’s ballads got less attention than their dancefloor-focused tracks, but At Last I Am Free deserves real shine. It’s an account of being teargassed at a Black Panther rally and the ensuing sense of disillusion, but it’s disguised as a sumptuous, crestfallen love song.Robert Wyatt’s coverdug into the song’s dejected mood.14. Sister Sledge – We Are Family (1979)Arguably the most famous Chic track of all – a song that has been played at everything from feminist rallies to sports victories and that’s clearly going to provoke party singalongs for the rest of time – was actually intended to reintroduce Sister Sledge to record buyers after a series of flops. Incredibly, their record label initially rejected it.View image in fullscreenDiana Ross in 1981.Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/CBS/Getty Images13. Diana Ross – I’m Coming Out (1980)After encountering drag queens dressed as Diana Ross, Rodgers and Edwards aimed to write her a gay anthem with the same power as Say It Loud – I’m Black and I’m Proud (Ross thought the lyrics referred to her breaking free of Motown’s strictures). A joy from start to finish, it became a huge hit and ultimately, achieved its initial aim.12. Sister Sledge – He’s the Greatest Dancer (1979)The faint hint that disco was perhaps getting a little too popular for its own good lurks on He’s the Greatest Dancer’s hymn to a designer-clad Adonis: the dancefloor is packed with “out-of-towners touring”. The problem being that another Chic-penned song as great as this was only going to make disco bigger.11. Daft Punk – Get Lucky (ft Pharrell Williams and Nile Rodgers) (2013)Rodgers’ 21st-century output has been of deeply variable quality, but Get Lucky was a global smash for a reason. A fantastic song built around Rodgers’ unmistakeable guitar, its take on disco is neither knowingly retro nor noticeably modern; even before it became completely inescapable it somehow sounded weirdly familiar, as if it always existed.10. Carly Simon – Why? (1982)A new direction for the Chic Organization’s sound: Rodgers’ guitar plays a reggae off-beat, the rhythm track is influenced by electro, Simon’s voice is cushioned by swathes of synth. The results are magic, the 12in mix a club perennial. Lumbered with an absolutely mortifying video, it flopped in the US, but was a huge European hit.9. David Bowie – Let’s Dance (1983)The Rodgers-produced Let’s Dance album may have been the moment when Bowie’s artistic quality control finally slackened in the quest for commercial acceptance, but the title track is magnificent: a brand of pop more strange and tense than its global smash status and its ubiquity following Bowie’s death might suggest.View image in fullscreenSheila & B Devotion in 1979.Photograph: ullstein bild Dtl./ullstein bild/Getty Images8. Sheila & B Devotion – Spacer (1979)As a point of contrast, it’s worth playing Sheila and B Devotion’s first British hit, a disco version of Singin’ in the Rain: it’s gormless tripe. Enter the Chic Organization, and Shelia and B Devotion are utterly transformed. From its wistful piano intro to its rock-y guitar solo, Spacer is sleek, sexy and surprisingly sparse perfection.7. Chic – I Want Your Love (1978)Chic at their vertiginous zenith, when Rodgers and Edwards seemed incapable of making anything that didn’t sound simultaneously flawless and effortless: the simplicity of the four-note hook balanced out by the complexity of the slow-building horn and string arrangement, which achieves euphoric take off at 3min 25sec.6. Chic – Everybody Dance (1977)More so than their debut single, Everybody Dance defined Chic’s sound, their ethos of music as a form of luxury goods: sophisticated, spare but somehow sumptuous, driven by incredible musicianship (listen to Edwards’s bass), lyrics that hymn the dancefloor as the cure for whatever might be ailing you.View image in fullscreenSister Sledge c 1980.Photograph: Gijsbert Hanekroot/Redferns5. Sister Sledge – Thinking of You (1979)A song that sounds like falling in love feels: check out the breakdown at 2min 53sec, when the strings relax into a gorgeous shimmer, Edwards hits a single bass note and Kathy Sledge sighs: “I’m in love again” – the most beautiful moment in the Chic Organization’s entire catalogue.4. Chic – Le Freak (1978)Rejection made creatively profitable. Originally a complaint about Rodgers and Edwards being refused entry to Studio 54, titled Fuck Off (there’s still a snarky quality to the finished song’s suggestion you “come on down to the 54”), Le Freak’s irresistible call to the dancefloor sold 7m copies, proof that living well is the best revenge.3. Diana Ross – Upside Down (1980)In a sense, Chic’s Diana Ross collaboration was a disaster: Ross hated the results and had the album remixed; the whole business ended up in court. But musically, it was magic, and nowhere more so than on Upside Down, potent enough to buck America’s disco backlash and reach No 1.2. Sister Sledge – Lost in Music (1979)Rodgers said We Are Family was “hands down” the Chic Organization’s greatest album, and Lost in Music – presumably inspired by Sister Sledge’s scuffling years prior to the album’s release – is its crowning glory: a song and production so perfect it never loses its power to transport you to a better place.1. Chic – Good Times (1979)Even in a catalogue as rich as Chic’s, Good Times stands out. For one thing, it’s got a hook of simplistic perfection and the greatest bass line Edwards ever came up with (one of the great bass lines full stop, sampled umpteen times since it was first borrowed by hip-hop pioneers the Sugarhill Gang). For another, it’s infinitely smarter than your average dependable party anthem, packed with lyrical references that equate America’s then-current economic situation to the Great Depression (“Happy days are here again,” it opens, mordantly). If you need proof that Chic were a cut above their disco peers, here it is.Explore more on these topicsRankedNile RodgersDiscoDance musicPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is there any particular genre that you haven’t tackled already butwould like to?LickyKickyI don’t care about genre. What interests me is first the story. When I have the story, I try to find the best genre with which to communicate it. So the genre arrives second, and very often I mix them.8 Womenwas not a musical to begin with. That was based on a play. Abadplay. Old-fashioned. But I loved the plot: eight women and one of them is a murderer. It was my idea to make it a musical because it was a way to be democratic. To give each character the chance to express herself with a song, with a dance. With all those actresses together, there might be one scene where, say,Isabelle Huppertis merely an extra in the background. And you say: “Isabelle, don’t move! Now Catherine, say your lines.” Isabelle loved it butCatherine Deneuvedidn’t get what I was trying to do. When she saw the film, she understood. But during the shoot, it was too theatrical for her.8 Women was very successful, and Catherine and I met again afterwards – we are human beings, we are able to talk, sometimes we have problems but we explain ourselves. Maybe our next film,Potiche, was easier for her because she was the main woman rather than one of eight. Also, she knew what kind of movie I wanted to make this time.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Ludivine Sagnier, Virginie Ledoyen, Catherine Deneuve, Danielle Darrieux, Isabelle Huppert, Firmine Richard and Emmanuelle Béart all starred in in 8 Women (2002).Photograph: Jean-Claude Moireau/Canal +/Fidelite Prods/Kobal/ShutterstockI treasure Potiche. Any plans for a sequel? I’d love to see the continuing exploits of the Pujol umbrella factory.JackFenwickThat would be funny because the film happened during the 1970s. The sequel could be in the 1980s. That’s an idea. But I’m not sure it’s possible to shoot again a film withGérard Depardieuwith all the problems he has today. He’s a great actor but now it’s difficult to finance a film with him. I haven’t made a sequel to my films but I know there is an Italian remake of 8 Women on Netflix. But now it’s 7 Women [7 Women and a Murder] because they cut out the Black character. It’s all white Italian women. And it’s not a musical, it’s just a whodunnit. So [raises eyebrow] I will let you see it for yourself.View image in fullscreenCatherine Deneuve in Potiche (2010), a comedy about a housewife who blossoms when she takes over her husband’s umbrella factory.Isabelle Huppert was recently asked:“Can a film change someone’s life?” She said:“Maybe it can change someone’s day.”Would you like to make films that change livesor is it enough for you to change a single day?Dmitry SFor me it’s about helping. I made a film which was very helpful for many people –By the Grace of God[about real-life cases of child abuse by Catholic priests in France]. It was not my goal; it was not what I set out to do. But it was a huge success in France. I had so many testimonies from people after they saw the film and it was so touching to hear people coming out about what they lived through as children. That’s when I realised the film had helped many people. Some were not able to speak out, but after watching it, they went to the police or told their family what happened to them.View image in fullscreenBy The Grace of God (2018), which explores the scandal of child abuse by priests.My original idea for this film was to make a documentary, because I loved the real people who told me their stories. I had conversations with the whole families: the children, the wives. But when I said, “I want to make a documentary about your story,” they said: “Please, no.” I realised they were only able to give me all this information because I was a fiction director. And they were waiting for me to make a kind ofSpotlight.After the brilliantIn the Houseand nowWhen Autumn Falls,I would like to ask: are you the reincarnation ofClaude Chabrol? Because it looks very much like you are carrying on his themes of good people doing bad things or bad people doing good things.jeroenspeculaasChabrol inspired me because he went in many directions and had a way of making movies which is very close to mine. There is a lot of pleasure in his films. He enjoyed telling stories. LikeFassbinder, it was not about making a masterpiece each time. I loveStanley Kubrick, too, but I feel closer to Chabrol and Fassbinder, who made many movies.I met Chabrol when he was filming The Girl Cut in Two. He was very sweet. He knew my films and complimented me on Under the Sand. I was touched. Actually, I met two directors of the Nouvelle Vague: Chabrol andEric Rohmer, who was my teacher. I’m closer to them than to Truffaut or Godard. Oh, Godard – I met him too! He came to my film school,La Fémis. And he was very mean in terms of money. Obsessed with money. Not generous like Chabrol or Rohmer, who wanted to communicate their passion. Cinema has to deal with money; it’s part of the job. But I was so surprised hearing Godard speaking only about money. I was waiting for something more intellectual.You’ve worked with so many iconic French stars. Are there any icons left that you still want to work with?Kal 85What will happen will happen. I know some directors make first the casting and after they try to find the story, but it’s not my way of working.I need first to have the story, to develop the script, and then I look for actors. But there are some counter-examples, such as Potiche, where I already knew Catherine. Before I started that script, I asked her if it was possible for her to be a “potiche” – a trophy wife. She said: “Why not?” Without her acceptance, I wouldn’t have made the film. But usually I work first on the script. When I wroteUnder the Sand, I had in mind a woman of 50 years old who was beautiful and who would agree to be in a swimsuit on the beach. And all the French actresses said no! I proposed the film first toIsabelle Adjani. When I worked with her much later on Peter von Kant, I said: “Do you remember?” And she said: “I never even read the script.”‘I never really learned anything from anybody’: Isabelle Huppert on 50 years in filmRead moreBut I had metCharlotte Ramplingata party and I thought she was beautiful. Everybody said: “Don’t work with her. She’s finished.” When Under the Sand was successful, that felt like a great revenge. And for Charlotte, it was a new start for her career. When I met with her and her agent to offer the role, I said: “I want to see Charlotte Rampling doing the vacuuming.” A very bad idea to say that at the first meeting. Her agent kicked me under the table! So that was a bad start. But she trusted me and we had a beautiful relationship. When she realised she would not be one of the eight women in 8 Women, she said: “That’s not a problem. Because I was the one woman in Under the Sand.”How do you look atPedro Almodóvar’srecent career, and do you have any ambitions like him [in The Room Next Door] to make an American adventure?ZaropansI love Pain and Glory. I thought it was a beautiful movie. Very personal and very honest. I was mixed about The Room Next Door. The fact that it was not in Spanish, I think, made him less comfortable with the dialogue. It can be difficult when you don’t have the ear for the language. That was the case for me when I made Angel, which was in English and was a big flop. In France, cinema is more important than everything, so we work all together for the film. And when I worked in England, I had the feeling everybody worked just for their own little area. By the way, people were surprised when I cast Michael Fassbender because he was not famous at that time. “Why this actor?” they said. But I loved Michael – he was beautiful and clever, and very involved.View image in fullscreenOzon in 2002, when he made 8 Women.Photograph: Mars Distribution/AllstarAs for working in the American system, I think it is difficult, especially for the French. There are some female directors right now who have done very well. ButCoralie Fargeatshot The Substance in France, remember, and I think with English money, no? [It was a Working Title production.] When you are used to working in the French system with final cut, the American way can be hard. I came close to working in Hollywood but there was not a lot of imagination in what I was being offered: after Swimming Pool, I was sent many scripts of erotic thrillers. But I don’t want to repeat myself. And I realised that in America, the producer is the master of the film and the director is just a technician. François Truffaut said that Americans respect you when you work in your own country, but when you work in their country, they destroy you.When Autumn Falls [When Fall Is Coming in the US] is in UK and Irish cinemas from 21 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmThe reader interviewFrançois OzonCharlotte RamplingIsabelle HuppertCatherine DeneuveinterviewsShareReuse this content"

As if!Trafalgar theatre, LondonAmy Heckerling adapts her own iconic screenplay for a lumbering production in need of more belters from composer KT TunstallArifa AkbarThu 13 Mar 2025 18.00 EDTShareWhat do you get if you cross a high-school movie with Jane Austen’s comedy of manners?Clueless, of course. The 1995 film was inspired by the plot of Emma, in which a frivolous young schemer falls for the serious-minded landed gent next door. This musical version again transposes the story of misguided friend-zoning to Beverly Hills High but where the film pulled off the outlandish melange of Austen and Americana, Rachel Kavanaugh’s production is a more lumbering hybrid.Emma is reborn as Cher (Emma Flynn), a wealthy LA valley-girl with an ensemble of privileged high schoolers around her who may well be branded nepo babies today. She manipulates grungy new girl Tai (Romona Lewis-Malley), all for the greater good of transforming her into a paragon of high-school popularity. Josh (Keelan McAuley), meanwhile, is the serious-minded chap who is helping Cher’s lawyer father with his cases and has a teasing relationship with her that builds into love.We are definitely in the 1990s because people are using Walkmans, talking lavishly about their pagers and brandishing brick-like mobile phones. Amy Heckerling adapts her own screenplay, sticking closely to the original, including the jibes about high-school cosmetic surgery, although mercifully Cher’s obsessive calorie talk has been excised.View image in fullscreenNeeds more fizz … l to r, Emma Flynn (Cher), Keelan McAuley (Josh) in Clueless.Photograph: Pamela RaithThe songs, composed byKT Tunstall, are disappointingly flat-footed except for two belters accompanied by comically energised choreography. Reasonable Doubts, sung by Josh and the ensemble, is a magnificent ode to teen jealousy, while I’m Keeping an Eye on You, performed when Josh turns up to a dance to watch over Cher, is as winning.If the score could fizz with more numbers like these then what a blast this show might be. But the lyrics by Glenn Slater too often serve as exposition rather than raising the emotional drama.The characters are peculiarly flat. Cher has flecks of Elle from Legally Blonde, Tai sounds like a cross between Bette Midler and Rizzo from Grease, Cher’s love interest Christian (Isaac J Lewis) speaks like a 1950s cliche. Josh is obnoxiously judgmental of Cher with the song Human Barbies, in which he accuses her of treating others like dolls. Maybe if he had watched Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, he might see things differently, although the script references nothing outside its 90s bubble – even when it is crying out for sly sideways glances, such as the moment in class whenCher debatesthe all too Trumpian question of whether immigrants should be admitted to the US.Still, the performances are strong, full of grinningly nasal high-school energy. Flynn nails the comedy in Cher’s failed seduction of Christian, while Blake Jordan, as the stoner skateboarder Travis, is sweetly portrayed, too. There is also some consolation in Mikiko Suzuki MacAdams’s clever set design, which sees sofas transforming into cars and a backdrop of the LA skyline changing colours to suit the mood. But this is a paler version of the film, laden with the retro “naff” factor but having less creativity and soul. The theatrical deification of the 1990s evidently continues apace, for the worse.AtTrafalgar theatre, London, until 27 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsWest EndKT TunstallCluelessreviewsShareReuse this content"

Dancers explain the appeal of GiselleLyndsey WinshipThu 13 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 13 Mar 2025 01.02 EDTShare‘Ithought I looked too healthy to play her,” says Miyako Yoshida of her debut in Giselle, back in the 90s, when she was a vibrant, strong young dancer asked to play the part of the sweet village girl with a weak heart. “But from the first time I came on stage, I could just live her,” she says; she simply became Giselle. Yoshida is not the only dancer, or audience member, or ballet critic, to fall in love with this 19th-century peasant girl. “It was always my favourite,” says English National Ballet’s Erina Takahashi, “emotionally you can explore yourself in such a wide range.” “It’s a perfect ballet choreographically,” according to veteran dancer Alessandra Ferri.Giselle is almost the oldest ballet heroine to still grace the stage, created in 1841 by librettist Théophile Gautier, choreographers Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot, and a young star ballerina of the day Carlotta Grisi. Through the decades the character has inspired legendary performances from some of the world’s best ballerinas: Galina Ulanova, Natalia Makarova, and more recently a startling interpretation fromNatalia Osipova.View image in fullscreenMiyako Yoshida in Giselle by the Royal Ballet in 1997.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianThe story centres on open-hearted Giselle who has fallen deeply in love with Albrecht, not knowing that he is actually a nobleman (and betrothed to boot) who is on holiday from responsibility and only pretending to be a fellow peasant. When she discovers his betrayal, Giselle descends into madness, and depending on which version you watch, either dies of a broken heart, or stabs herself with Albrecht’s sword. The second act shifts from sunny pastorale to ghostly woods and the vengeful wilis, the spirits of jilted women who force men to dance themselves to death. They’re gunning for Albrecht, except that Giselle’s love for him is so enduring that she saves him. It’s a rich role for a ballerina, from girlish to deranged to otherworldly all in one night. “You die for your soul to be free, so you learn how one should love,” Ferri told a meeting of theLondon Ballet Circlerecently. “When you are able to dance from that profundity, the ballet is eternal.”The ballet is as popular as ever, performed by major ballet companies around the world. One of those,National Ballet of Japan, under Yoshida’s direction, is bringingtheir version to Londonthis summer. It’s also been repeatedly reinvented.Mats Ek’s versiontook place in an asylum, Dance Theatre of Harlem’s in a Louisiana plantation. InAkram Khan’s award-winning 2016production, a huge hit for English National Ballet (it tours to Taiwan in May), Giselle and her fellow “villagers” are migrant factory workers, trapped in poverty behind the set’s huge domineering wall.Another reimagining of Giselle is about to debut in London made by two artists who had never actually seen the ballet before they decided to make the show. Swiss theatre director François Gremaud was simply looking for a ballet with its heroine’s name in the title, having made a successful piece based on Racine’s Phèdre (he completed the trilogy with operatic heroine Carmen). But in the end, “we fell in love with the ballet, and I must say, with the character,” says Gremaud. His partner in the production is Dutch dancer Samantha van Wissen, known for her work with Belgian choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker – austere, rigorous contemporary dance that’s worlds away from floaty Romantic ballet. The work they have made,Giselle..., showing as part of theDance Reflections festival, is a deconstruction of the ballet, with van Wissen explaining the story, the scenery, the historical context, and playing all the characters.For Gremaud, it’s about revisiting the work and trying to give a modern take. “Ballet has greatly constrained the female body, not least because it was a masculine projection of the feminine ideal,” he says. “In our show, we wanted to tell the story of the original ballet very faithfully, with respect, and at the same time make a real contemporary gesture by putting on stage a performer who is absolutely free. Samantha improvises her dances every night.”View image in fullscreen‘I never thought I could be touched like this by a classical ballet’: Giselle... by François Gremaud and Samantha van Wissen with music by Luca Antignani.Photograph: Dorothée Thébert FilligerIn the research, Gremaud and van Wissen watched videos of multiple productions, but their favourite wasAmerican Ballet Theatre’s from 1977, with Makarova and Mikhail Baryshnikov. “It goes beyond technique,” says van Wissen. “You really see, through the movement, the love between those people. It made a link to my work with Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, where she always said: ‘It starts from the movement.’ You don’t add too much theatricality, the movement speaks enough.” It was revelatory for van Wissen. “I never thought I could be touched like this by a classical ballet.”Gremaud says great theatrical characters stand the test of time when they represent universal ideas. For Giselle, that’s unconditional love. “She places love above everything, above revenge, even her own death,” he says. It’s not very feminist though, is it? Unconditional love for someone who treats you badly. “Some have interpreted Giselle as a submissive woman,” Gremaud admits. “But in the second act she really takes control. She’s the one who acts, and it’s thanks to her that Albrecht survives. So she can also, I think, be seen as a strong woman who stands up for what she believes is right.”View image in fullscreenFrom girlish to deranged … James Streeter (Albrecht), Stina Quagebeur (Myrtha) and Tamara Rojo (Giselle) in Akram Khan’s Giselle.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianTakahashi danced the leading role in Khan’s version and saw the character recast in a more 21st-century light, but still sees the same woman at heart. “Classical Giselle is quite vulnerable,” she says, “and Akram’s Giselle might look strong, she’s the leader of the group, but I think inside she has the same sensitivity. She’s also very open, she’s a positive person, and when tragedy comes, that really hurts.” Giselle continues to be an inspiration, 184 years on. “It’s a piece of genius,” says choreographer Sally Marie, who is working on an idea for a “Fuck-you feminist sci-fi punk version of Giselle”, yet one she says will be “still filled with the innocence and the longing for love”.Gremaud found other connections with the present, looking at how the Romantic movement was in part a reaction to the industrial revolution. “They were fighting against the way we were treating nature,” he says. “They were artists who were angry with their world.

The record probably wouldn’t have existed at all had crate-digging record collectors not chanced upon Waiting for the Trumpet to Sound, a 1974 single by gospel group the Staples Jr Singers, released on a Mississippi label so obscure that only one copy has ever been sold on Discogs. It came to the attention of Greg Belson, a British-born, LA-based soul DJ, who has carved out a niche playing recherché dancefloor-friendly gospel (if you want to hear the Lord’s praises being sung amid the sweatily hedonistic environs of Glastonbury’s gay club NYC Downlow, then he’s your go-to guy). He included its B-side on a 2019 compilation, The Time for Peace is Now: Gospel Music About Us.The song’s author, Annie Caldwell, has recalled receiving “a call from a man, I think his name was David”. It was former Talking Heads frontman David Byrne, whose Luaka Bop label released the compilation and then the Staples Jr Singers’ solitary album. Caldwell’s surprise at being contacted about records she had made in her early teens didn’t deter her from suggesting Byrne’s label might also be interested in the band she had been leading for the last 40 years, comprised of her husband, children and goddaughter. They were, and you can see why.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Can’t Lose My (Soul).Traditional gospel has been having something of a moment, thanks to a series of archival releases, 21st century artists – most notably theHarlem Gospel Travelers– and sampling: 70s tracks by Pastor TL Barrett have been plundered by Loyle Carner and Kanye West, whose album 2019 Jesus is King was similarly packed with gospel interpolations.Even so, a band releasing their debut album and playing hip European festivals 40 years into their existence is undoubtedly peculiar. The climate might be welcoming, but this wouldn’t have happened had Annie and the Caldwells not been exceptionally good at what they do, and Can’t Lose My (Soul) underlines just how good that is.The vocals are raw but perfectly pitched; there’s a kind of telepathic interplay between Annie Caldwell’s lead and the harmonies of her daughters during the improvised sections of the lengthy title track and Don’t You Hear Me Calling. So is the band, who somehow contrive to sound both extremely tight and yet spontaneous: if, as Deborah Caldwell has claimed, the band “don’t practise”, then their performances here are an advert for the honing effect of playing in church every other Sunday.They’re also musically diverse. For all Annie Caldwell claims to have co-opted her daughters into the band after hearing them singing blues – “I said: let me get those girls before the devil gets them,” she told me last year – there’s a distinct blues undertow to the title track. Dear Lord deals in tough funk, equipped with a liquid bassline that Bootsy Collins would have been proud of. I’m Going to Rise bears the influence of southern soul, the emotional edginess of the vocals cushioned by the wah-wah lushness of the music. Their uptempo tracks, meanwhile, sit in the vicinity of disco: you can detect something of Chaka Khan’s late 70s solo albums about I Made It and Wrong, the latter track momentarily shifting its gaze from the heavens to infidelity – albeit laying the blame at Satan’s door – to the accompaniment of a fabulous cyclical guitar lick that’s begging to be sampled (disco legend and sometime house producerNicky Sianohas already remixed it).Annie and the Caldwells: Wrong ft Deborah Caldwell Moore – videoThese are great, powerful, moving songs, made all the more potent by the fact that they’re recorded live, without an audience, in a church in the band’s hometown of West Point, Mississippi. The plain production makes Can’t Lose My (Soul) feel as if it’s happening before your eyes, adding a vividness and urgency, particularly in extempore moments. Mercifully, it steers clear of the kind of faux-antiquing that’s often applied to 21st-century soul music rooted in the past, as if trying to convince you that you’re listening to a long-lost album.The lyrics steer clear of the hellfire and brimstone sermonising to which southern gospel can be prone: they never stint on describing hard times – bereavement, grief, a miraculous escape from a house fire (“God spoke to death, he told death: behave!”) – but their message is ultimately one of hope. You don’t need to share the Caldwells’ faith to find something powerful and inspiring in that, particularly given the current climate, which can easily incline you towards hopelessness; something steeped in tradition seems apropos right now. You should listen to Can’t Lose My (Soul) purely on musical terms. Moreover, it’s an album you might need.Can’t Lose My (Soul) is released on Luaka Bop on 21 MarchThis week Alexis listened toSteven Wilson – The OverviewAn 18-minute-long suite that throws in every influence imaginable from Warp Records-style techno to Floyd melancholy to gleefully OTT prog-metal and somehow, astonishingly, works: unexpected but triumphant.Explore more on these topicsMusicAlexis Petridis's album of the weekSoulalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

I was doing A-levels in Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, the former mining community I depict in my TV seriesSherwood. My comprehensive school was one of the biggest in the country, one of a very small number with a working theatre. I wouldn’t be doing what I get to do now without that massive bit of luck.I started doing loads of acting, and the department decided to do the first A-level drama they’d ever done because there were about a dozen of us who wanted to keep going after GCSEs.The course introduced us to commedia dell’arte and we got to do a scene from Accidental Death of an Anarchist. The plot is inspired by a real event that happened in Milan in the 1960s when an anarchist died after he “fell out of the window” from a high floor of a police station. The wisecracking fraudster Maniac arrives to be interviewed by a low-level inspector. When the inspector is called away, Maniac answers the phone and learns that a judge is coming in to review the case. He sees the opportunity to impersonate that judge by working with them to generate “a better version” of the lie. So he begins joyfully unravelling their story. I and a bunch of other lads thought it was the most hilarious thing we’d ever read.We all had to do “work experience” – go to, say, Halfords and stack shelves. We thought, let’s see if we can convince our teachers that we’re going to do a production of Accidental Death of an Anarchist. Under the pressure of weekly rep. Monday morning you learn your lines, Friday night you’re on stage. And it went so well that in 2000, we took it to the Edinburgh festival.I was the constable, a barely speaking role. But I loved it because you got to be part of the whirligig of madness as it begins to spiral out of control. They let me choreograph the beginning of the scene when the constable was on his own waiting for the senior officers to arrive. I was just sweeping up, listening to some music, and it turned into a dance sequence in that classic cliche of a private moment when a character gets taken by the music and starts to dance with his broom. I’m not saying it was stage magic but it always ended with my arse stuck in a dustbin, legs over my head. The audience just roared. I couldn’t really understand why but I remember looking out as they applauded, thinking: “God,thisis interesting”.I get to write big political plays these days but I feel very fortunate that my introduction to live theatre was the low-art laughs that unite an audience. I probably take it too far sometimes in my own work, but the shameless search for a gag is never far away. Whenever I’m watching one of my own plays and I know there’s not a joke coming for the next three or four minutes I start to fidget.I was quite an introverted, shy kid. But finding a bunch of mates whose enthusiasm and commitment carried me along gave me the confidence to keep going. Along with another lad in the show, Gary, I went on to study drama at Hull and we were both the first in our family to go to university. It was a big deal for us.They called Fo “the Master” and Anarchist is a Venn diagram of perfection for me when it comes to political anger: a play in search of justice, exposing corruption, but also just the most impeccably crafted escalation of farce and stupidity and silliness and wonder.As told to Lindesay IrvineJames Graham’s adaptation of Alan Bleasdale’sBoys from the Blackstuffis on tour until 5 July.

It will bring the frequently warring Gallagher brothers back together for the first time since an acrimonious split in 2009.NME reported this week that sources close to the group claimed the full band lineup would be the brothers plus original guitarist Paul “Bonehead” Arthurs, along with Andy Bell (bass), Gem Archer (guitar) and Joey Waronker (drums).An unimpressed Liam Gallagher wrote on X in response: “It’s not the lineup reveal I’m bothered about I’ll reveal that to you in a minute I’m more bothered about the line where it says a source close to the band and tour that really causes me a great deal of concern.” He jokingly wrote his own lineup, featuring four of Oasis’s former drummers.The tour film adds another project to a busy recent slate for Knight, who has been the writer-producer of TV series This Town, The Veil and A Thousand Blows in the last two years.He has also written and produced The Immortal Man, a film which continues the Peaky Blinders saga, filmed for Netflix in autumn 2024 with a release date yet to be announced.Explore more on these topicsOasisDocumentary filmsTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

Robinson added that she had since become devoted to the lifestyle.LiveFormer En Vogue singer Dawn Robinson reveals she has lived in her car for three years – video“This is not like, ‘Oh my God, poor Dawn. She’s living in her car. It’s terrible. Oh, woe is me,’” Robinson said in the nearly 20-minute video. “I’m learning about who I am. I’m learning myself as a person, as a woman.”Though Robinson did not go into detail, she explained that she began taking refuge in her car in 2020 after living with her parents in Las Vegas and that her relationship with her mother became troubled, causing her to move into her car.She said she slept in her car for about a month before staying with a manager in LA, but he ultimately didn’t have room for her, so she wound up in a hotel he paid for. She worried whether he could continue to pay the hotel bill.“I told my assistant one day, ‘I have been researching car life,” she said. “I loved what I was seeing.”Despite the first night in the vehicle being “scary” she said she soon learned how to make herself feel safe. She described the first time she watched a sunset from her vehicle as “beautiful.”“I was so free, I felt like I was on a camping trip,” she said. “It was the right thing to do, I didn’t regret it.”According todatafrom the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, over 40% of the unsheltered homeless population in LA county rely on vehicles (defined as cars, vans and RVs) for shelter. According to the University of California, Los Angeles’Institute of Transportation Studies, there is a lack of research on this large and growing population.Robinson rose to fame in the early 1990s as part of En Vogue with Terry Ellis, Cindy Herron and Maxine Jones. The band would go on to become one of the most successful girl groups of all time, selling upwards of 20m records and nabbing seven Grammy nominations, with hits including Free Your Mind, Don’t Let Go (Love), Giving Him Something He Can Feel and Hold On. Billboard named them the second most successful female group of the 1990s.Explore more on these topicsUS newsR&BPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

While Netflix has not confirmed which novel is being adapted, it is thought to be The Magician’s Nephew, which islisted on the Internet Movie Databaseas Gerwig’s next project.Published in 1955, The Magician’s Nephew was the sixth in Lewis’s seven-novel series, but is the first chronologically. It acts as an origins story for the celebrated wardrobe of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, and chronicles the creation of Narnia by Aslan the lion. Two children, Digory and Polly, are the novel’s central characters, with Digory’s uncle Andrew also playing a significant role.Speculation has centredon Craig playing either Uncle Andrew or Aslan (the latter presumably being a voice role).Netflix purchased the rightsto make film and TV adaptations of the Narnia series in 2018 – and it is the first time rights to all seven books have been held by a single company. Lewis himself did not sell screen rights to the books, believing it was not possible to make convincing adaptations. His estate later had a rights agreement with Walden Media, which released three Narnia films – The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Prince Caspian and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader – between 2005 and 2010. However, the agreement ended after Dawn Treader struggled at the box office, leading to Lewis’s heirs looking elsewhere.While confirmed details of Gerwig’s project are thin on the ground,Deadline reportedthat singer Charli xcx was under serious consideration for a role.Explore more on these topicsFilmDaniel CraigGreta GerwigCS LewisFilm adaptationsNetflixnewsShareReuse this content"

Martha, an enthusiastic writer, died in 2021 aged 13.Entrants are asked to submit up to 500 words of prose – such as a diary entry, a fictional story or a piece of schoolwork – by 6 June.Young writers can take the theme in any direction they would like – the “new world” could be “a physical place, a past or future community or simply a different or novel experience”, say the organisers. “You might write about something that has affected your life, or the life of someone you know. Or your ideas could be purely imaginative.”View image in fullscreenMartha writing a story on holiday in 2018.Photograph: Courtesy of Merope MillsThree winning writers will each receive £200 along with a selection of books and a “special souvenir”.

Don’t worry if you haven’t written much before or don’t know if you’re a ‘writer’.”Last year’s prize, which Philip Pullman helped judge, was won by Sophia Austin, Isla Barrack and Noa Spencer-Brown for their entries on the theme of “A Secret”.Pullman, Cottrell-Boyce, Malorie Blackman and Katherine Rundell – who featured on the inaugural judging panel – were among the writers Martha was inspired by. “We weren’t able to witness her grow as a reader and writer, but we hope the Martha Mills prize will inspire other young writers,” said Mills and Laity.Further details on how to enter can be found on theLondon Review Bookshop’s website.Explore more on these topicsBooksAwards and prizesChildren and teenagersFamilynewsShareReuse this content"

Everyone is watching and there are huge tectonic shifts and enormous questions facing leadership and political leadership at the moment,” she said.“But we have an advantage with the arts in that we can speak that language of allegory. We can speak to both pertinent and timeless issues at once, [so] now is the time to double down on exactly that.”The opening event features a marathon eight-hour performance at the Usher Hall of Sir John Tavener’s religious song cycle The Veil of the Temple, which Benedetti said spoke to the role religious belief played in illuminating universal truths.Give Edinburgh fringe the same status as Olympics, departing head urgesRead moreBeing staged for the first time in the UK in 20 years, it features 250 singers from several companies singing about the Christian, Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist faiths in five languages, including Aramaic and Church Slavonic.The following day the Usher Hall will host 120 teenage musicians from the NYO2 youth orchestra based at Carnegie Hall in New York, who start a three-year festival residency this year, as well as 20 young Scottish musicians. They will collaborate in a family concert that afternoon, followed by a performance of Prokofiev’s fifth symphony.Benedetti said grand scale and mass participation were central to the festival’s ethos. In another event, chamber musicians with the Aga Khan music programme would jam on the spot, with audience members able to request pieces of music.She said: “We are committed to infusing a relatable, casual, open and trusting vibe into everything we do, in spirit and in action.” That would include again selling about 50,000 tickets for £30 or less, alongside £10 offers and half-price tickets for teenagers.Other notable events, she said, included the premiere of a new play starring the Succession actor Brian Cox, satirising the Scottish banker Fred Goodwin and his role in the 2008 financial crisis, with Cox playing the ghost of the economist Adam Smith.There is also a newScottish Ballet production on the feud between Mary, Queen of Scots and Elizabeth I, featuring punk couture costumes, stilts and a male dancer playing Mary; an Australian production of the opera Orpheus and Eurydice, featuring a contemporary circus company and video projections; and the premiere of a hip-hop interpretation of JS Bach’s work featuring dancers from Acland Burghley school in north London and 18th-century period instruments.This year’s festival would be smaller than previous years, Benedetti said, because of funding cuts, with contemporary music and opera pared back.Speaking in January, Benedetti expressed alarm about thethreat to Scottish arts from cutsin government and philanthropic funding. But she said a subsequent award to the festival of £11.75m over the next three years, part of a £200m nationwide funding package from Creative Scotland, was “pivotal”.She said she hoped three-year funding pledges would be honoured. “You have to proceed with a level of confidence and plan ambitiously, but you also hope for a level of non-partisan integrity around promises made,” she said.The Edinburgh international festival runs from 1 to 25 August and tickets go on general sale on 27 March viaeif.co.uk.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The nine songs that make up La Bonne Chanson are all settings of poems by Paul Verlaine that Fauré shaped into a celebration of his love for the married Emma Bardac, who would later become the second wife of Claude Debussy.With immaculate French diction, Spence marvellously conveys the scarcely contained ecstasy of each song, his vocal lines beautifully cushioned by the strings of the Piatti Quartet and double-bass player. But the cycle occupies less than half the running time of the disc; the remainder is filled with a selection of other, mostly early Fauré songs, which includes such favourites as Lydia, En Sourdine and Clair de Lune, as well as the three settings that make up Poème d’un Jour, Op 21; all are delivered with equal finesse by Spence and pianist Julius Drake.Listen on Apple Music (below) orSpotifyAllow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted on embed.music.apple.com.

The excitement with which various “bookfluencers” clutched them was twofold. Brown appeared on the Granta Best of Young British Novelists list in 2023, and Universality is the follow-up to her 2021 debut,Assembly, which saw her shortlisted for a Goldsmiths, Orwell, and Folio prize: its critical and commercial popularity has undoubtedly created a sense of anticipation for this next book. But alongside that fact was the feeling that the proof itself provoked as an aesthetic object: striking and slender, with its reflective gold jacket and spectrally engraved lettering. “Oh, it’s a book,” a family member of mine exclaimed on holding it, having been intrigued by what I was carrying around. It wasn’t an absurd response. Those early copies were fashioned to look like bars of gold, in reference to the fact that the first 49 pages are delivered in the style of a magazine feature about a young man who uses one to bludgeon the leader of a group called The Universalists, a faction of political activists (or squatters, depending on who you ask) attempting to form a self-sustaining “microsociety” on a Yorkshire farm during the Covid-19 pandemic.It’s the sort of story that would set social media alight for days, or rather, as Brown wryly notes in the book’s second chapter, two weeks: “a modern parable [that exposes] the fraying fabric of British society”. Each detail is more eye-popping than the last. Both the farm and the gold belong to a banker named Richard Spencer, a man with “multiple homes, farming land, investments and cars […] a household staff; a pretty wife, plus a much younger girlfriend”. A perfect symbol, in short, of “the excessive fruits of late capitalism”. Jake, the young man doing the bludgeoning, is the son of a reactionary British journalist, Miriam “Lenny” Leonard, whose columns are designed less to provoke thought and more to go viral online. The Universalists themselves share DNA with Extinction Rebellion, and do just as good a job at polarising the great British public. At the centre of it all is that gold ingot, with which, post-bludgeoning, Jake absconds after police raid the farm. Hence the flashy proofs. Except – not really. Engraved on the back of each copy is a quote from the penultimate chapter: “Words are your weapons, they’re your tools, your currency.” After the first section the conceit of a magazine feature drops, with succeeding chapters told from different characters’ perspectives. We learn to read carefully.It’s worth, in this case, not spoiling the remainder of the plot. Brown worked in financial services for a decade, and her novels so far inherit as themes the mediums through which she has earned her living: the circulation of money, and language – both their own salient forms of capital. Nevertheless, Brown knows that her readers’ biases are the most satisfying currency shecan trade on and so creates, in a mere 156 pages, an impressive matryoshka doll of a story, where each established fact is progressively re-rendered with increasing detail and nuance.Pronouncements on 'wokeism', on meritocracy, on race and culture wars fall from characters’ mouths like bombsAssembly was a similarly slim novel about a Black female banker recently diagnosed with cancer who prepares to attend a party at her boyfriend’s parents’ country estate. It drew comparisons to Mrs Dalloway, but should rightfully have been read against French philosopher and linguist Roland Barthes: Brown’s self-professed aim when she began writing was to assess whether “language can be neutral” in the context of 21st-century identity politics. Despite a lucrative job and a dynamic mind, as an ill Black woman the narrator of Assembly functioned as a discrete semiotic system on to which other characters (and, regrettably, various readers) projected, to quote Barthes, “the weight of a gaze conveying an intention that [ceased to be] linguistic”. Various well-meaning remarks uttered by other characters betrayed a series of flawed insights regarding the narrator’s status, potential, health, emotional wellbeing and desires. “I grew up dirt poor, you know […] So I get it. I get the grind. All this – it’s as foreign to me as it is to you,” a work colleague tells the narrator, despite having no discernible knowledge of her upbringing or previous work history. That such utterances were rejected by the narrator herself went somewhat ironically unnoticed by most of the people who interviewed Brown during her publicity run for the book. “Why subject myself further to their reductive gaze?” read one passage. “To this crushingobjecthood. Why endure my own dehumanisation?” Why not, in other words, try to be free?This time Brown is having more fun within the constraints of our current sociopolitical discourse. Universality is less measured than its predecessor, and trades on the inverse of its core question: nothing about the language in it is neutral. Pronouncements on “wokeism”, on meritocracy, on race and culture wars fall from characters’ mouths like bombs. Thanks to the novel’s ingenious structure, the more you hear them, the more you realise how inhibiting they are, and how soul-crushingly tiring it is to spend your one precious life negotiating their deployment in a rigged and utterly useless system: a realisation only one character profits from, though dangerously so.It’ll be interesting to watch Brown navigate her publicity run in an era of tech bros heralding a very particular mode of free speech. If Assembly was a meditation on the linguistic construction of cultural myths that dominate our present-day understanding of identity, then the final two chapters of Universality successfully consolidate this new novel as an observational satire about the language games that enable that process. To this end, Brown is one of our most intelligent voices writing today, able to block out the short-term chatter around both identity and language in order to excavate much more uncomfortable truths. And despite how genuinely satisfying it is to watch her deconstruct the world as we know it now, Universality arouses in me an excitement over what could happen should she ever choose to stray from social realism. Whatshouldwe be doing with language? How might things look otherwise?Universality by Natasha Brown is published by Faber (£14.99).

Tonight’s opening show sets out the intention: to honour classics of 20th-century dance, and introduce current artists following in their slipstream.Here, Working Title, from 1985, by the great postmodern choreographer Trisha Brown (who died in 2017) is paired with a recent piece from French choreographerNoé Soulier, made for Brown’s company. Soulier’s piece,In the Fall, is full of Trisha Brown-ness. It opens with the dancers in long, still poses, bodies making sharp V-shapes or finely tuned angles. They balance, they lean, they inevitably fall. They create perfect forms and yet at the same time they’re so human: all that impossible striving, all the failure, and the keeping-trying.The solos and duos build to a mesmerising mass of movers on stage, who lunge, lean, hop, fold and push forward – you can see the weight travelling through their bodies. There’s a gathering power and a clarity that is utterly satisfying.View image in fullscreenEase and naturalness … Working Title by Trisha Brown Dance Company.Photograph: Joyce BaranovaWorking Title is built on a similar highly skilled simplicity, with purposeful angles and casual bounce. There’s ease and naturalness at the same time as absolute command of the material. Some of the movement is improvised, apparently, but it feels logical, as if someone had a plan. There’s none of the mild anxiety of watching dance where you’re wondering what’s going on. It just is. And it invites you to just be.The music, by composer Peter Zummo, keeps introducing new ideas, phrases phasing in and out, much as the dancers do. It’s like a walk in nature – Look at this! Look at that! Listen! – or people-watching in the city. The world changes around us: duos, trios and different groupings, there’s concord (never discord) and counterpoint. And there’s a brightness too, an uncynical nature to the work. It feels hopeful. Onwards, they keep dancing, keep moving – as we all must.AtSadler’s Wells, London, until 13 March.Dance Reflectionscontinues until 8 April.Explore more on these topicsDanceTrisha BrownSadler's WellsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The quartet’s blend of funk grooves, soulful vocals and thunderous basslines were on regular rotation from Hoxton’s Blue Note to Camden’s Dingwalls courtesy of DJs such as Gilles Peterson and Eddie Piller. Today, their hits Dream on Dreamer and Midnight at the Oasis are more likely to be regular picks for Magic FM’s drive-time slot, while their 11 albums have been released to lessening levels of fanfare, mostly leaving the group to be defined as pioneers of a bygone genre: acid jazz.So they seem to have a point to prove as they arrive at a sold outRoyal Albert Hall, rounding out a tour that’s marked 30 years since the release of their most commercially successful album, 1994’s Brother Sister. Backed by the colossal London Concert Orchestra, original members guitarist Simon Bartholomew (adorned in a feather boa) and bassist Andrew Levy (sporting tight sequined trousers) and new vocalist Angela Ricci launch into a lively two-hour set.View image in fullscreenIndefatigable … Angela Ricci.Photograph: Sonja Horsman/Sonja Horsman / The GuardianThe rhythm section thumps for most of the show and keeps the audience on its feet, with Levy and drummer Luke Harris drowning out the string section on the disco-funk of Sister Sledge pastiche Back to Love and locking in tight for the mid-tempo groove of Stay This Way. While interest drops on slower numbers such as Brother Sister’s title track and the woozy lovers rock track People Giving Love, the room bounces when the band go back to punchy tempos. Dream on Dreamer shows off the group’s knack for uplifting, earworming melody and a sprightly, strings-led version of Never Stop highlights Ricci’s indefatigable vocals. A special appearance from their acid jazz contemporaries – James Taylor on Hammond organ, and Incognito vocalist Tony Momrelle – highlights the genre’s urban-sophisticate appeal, charging through Incognito and Jocelyn Brown’s classy 1991 classic Always There.Closing out in similarly joyous fashion on the vamping melodies of Forever, the 2025 iteration of the Brand New Heavies demonstrates that there is plenty more party-starting life left in these three-decade-old songs.Explore more on these topicsMusicSoulR&BPop and rockRoyal Albert Halllive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

The lights flicker and we hear a few bars of the 60s hit You Don’t Own Me: “Don’t tell me what to do / Don’t tell me what to say.”Enter stage left: a body zipped inside a clothes bag, wriggling then rolling along the floor. Emerging from this chrysalis is Josie Dale-Jones, here to revisit the high-profilecancellation mid-rehearsalsof her company’s sex education theatre production three years ago. Part autobiography and part fiction, this inquest – previously staged at the Edinburgh festival where it won a Fringe First award – explores events before, after and in the eye of the storm surrounding The Family Sex Show. Thousands signed a petition against it, one of its venues received a bomb threat and Dale-Jones was branded sick, irresponsible – and much worse – for exploring material deemed “inappropriate” for young audiences.While this opening strikes a note of defiance, Dale-Jones also issues mea culpas in a production with text by Abbi Greenland and directed by Rachel Lemon. One section features a list of mistakes made with the show and its supporting material online. Another section itemises inaccurate assumptions and claims made against the show, contrary to its planned content. There are many eye-watering quotes from abusive emails received by the theatre-maker.View image in fullscreenStriking … A Little Inquest Into What We Are All Doing Here.Photograph: Alex BrennerIt is a difficult subject to tackle in more ways than one as at the centre of this production is something intangible: a performance shut down before it existed. “The idea of the show” is what was dangerous, says Dale-Jones, who expected it to be controversial – as, you may assume, did Arts Council England, which funded her company. But the institution is depicted as being equally ambushed by the backlash. “I wanted you to be less scared than I was,” she tells them.Dale-Jones discusses her experience of sex education (condoms on courgettes, tampons in Ribena) and why she wanted to equip children for “healthy and functional relationships”. There could be more nuance here about how and when children should learn about sex and what the current curriculum is doing (a snippet from PMQs is underpowered). In one section she poses like a sculpture in a gallery as a contrast is drawn between nudity on stage and in visual art – one of several scenes where you wish the perspective was wider. Censorship, freedom of expression, failure of leadership and a climate of fear in the arts are all live issues in the wake ofA Midsummer Night’s Dream being cancelled at Manchester’s Royal Exchange. Here, the focus is usually micro not macro.But it makes for a bold, nightmarish and surprisingly humorous hour of artistic self-assessment, with a striking lighting design by James Mackenzie. A late rug pull featuring co-star Laurence Baker weakens the impact of a memoir that is often imaginatively rendered – the script at one point continually glitching on the word “safe” – with an edge of jeopardy akin to whenRichard Gadd first performed Baby Reindeer. And the startling opening scene is darkly recast in a conclusion that captures her still fluctuating responses to the furore.AtShoreditch Town Hall, London, until 15 March.

Much more than cosy – it’s healingSarah Maria GriffinThu 13 Mar 2025 07.04 EDTShareThe term “cosy game” typically inspires one of two responses in those of us who play video games regularly. It will either call you in with the promise of soft, resource-management oriented gameplay whose slower pace offers a gentle escape and a bucolic alternative to gunslinging and high-stress adventure. Or it will repel you – as admittedly, it repels me. Cosy is often a kind of code for twee, low-stakes domestic adventures where drama is eschewed in favour of repetitive tasks intended to generate comfort, or imitate lightning-in-a-bottle resource management sims such asStardew ValleyorAnimal Crossing.So when faced with Wanderstop, a colourful game in which a fallen warrior trades in her fighting life for managing a tea shop, I was hesitant. However, this is Davey Wreden’s third project, after The Stanley Parable and The Beginner’s Guide, which means that, if it is anything like its predecessors, it will be full of surprises and made with deep attention to detail and artistic vision. Wreden is an auteur – one of his trademarks being a knowing, wry postmodernism. His work bends what the medium of the video game is capable of, and thankfully this latest offering is no exception.View image in fullscreenUrn your living … Wanderstop.Photograph: Annapurna InteractiveWanderstop excels at combining the nature of the gameplay with a narrative about the perils of burnout. The game practises what it preaches – it does not simply gesture towards a quiet life; rather, it erects one around the player whether they like it or not.Alta, our fallen warrior protagonist, distinctly does not like it. She has lost too many battles in a row, and on a quest to study under her hero, finds herself collapsing in the woods. Boro, a benevolent gentleman who runs the Wanderstop teashop, takes Alta in and coaxes her into participating in some tea-making and light chores until she recovers. Characters come and go while the player makes them tea and maintains the colourful and dangerously Ghibli-esque gardens. Aside from making tea, you can take care of some fine creatures that look like puffins. Take photos. Sweep. Gather trinkets. Read some of the books that are lying around. Grow plants, pick seeds, grow bigger plants, pick fruit. Use the fruit to make tea. Give the tea away to your guests, or drink it yourself, staring into the lovely landscape.View image in fullscreenGrowing pleasure … Wanderstop.Photograph: Annapurna InteractiveThis is not an unfamiliar vignette. Wytchwood, Spiritfarer, Spirittea, Moonstone Island – there are plenty of games that deal in combining botanical ingredients to fulfil the wishes of whimsical creatures. What makes Wanderstop different is that it refuses to hand you progress or resolution. There is no way to optimise, no way to tick off boxes, no pressure. No winning. The game refuses to give you the satisfaction of the grind, of boxes ticking up, neat little rows of plants. To explain how the story manages this would be to spoil the great magic trick of the game – but suffice to say I was awestruck at real ludonarrative harmony in action. It is one thing to talk, within the dialogue and story of a game, about burnout. About working so hard you can no longer even think about working. It is one thing to extol the virtues of rest. It is another altogether to actively demonstrate what surrender and healing look and feel like.On a technical level, the game offers no resistance – the controls are immaculate, straightforward and cleanly executed. The music is pleasant and unobtrusive, the voice acting is used in small doses and is very strong. The mechanical aspects of the game are perfectly tuned and the dialogue and incidental text are funny, surprising, and shockingly poignant when they need to be. There are no snags to trip up on, nothing in the way of a deeply transporting experience.It takes around 12 hours to “complete” Wanderstop, but for me the game demanded a replay immediately. I was eager to return to the gardens around the teashop, to look for secrets, to talk to Boro as much as possible. To linger for a little while more. To slow down, and to consider what exactly it is that is rushing all of us.

But Grozev is just one of the many in Putin’s crosshairs, so the film opens out to cover several whistleblowers, dissidents and activists. Hopping between location-stamped world cities like a Hollywood thriller, the film has a Michael Mann-like dynamism and pathos in detailing the emotional cost of this defiance.After identifying hitmen and helping a whistleblower from Russia’s chemical weapons programme to flee toEurope, Grozev finds himself on a kill-list. Warned of an imminent threat, he is unable to return home to Vienna; exiled in New York, he impotently frets about his family’s safety. His doctor points out that, where most people’s stress levels fluctuate, his are unwaveringly high – even when asleep. His situation is better, though, than his friend Alexei Navalny or fellow dissident Vladimir Kara-Murza, both in Russian detention in 2023; Grozev is involved in attempts to negotiate prisoner swaps for both.The common thread in these vignettes of resistance is the sheer vindictiveness of the Putin regime’s retribution. Even after poisoning Kara-Murza twice, they continue to tighten the screw; he is imprisoned on specious slander charges and punished at one point for lying down in his cell. All of these rebels are protagonists in their own paranoid thrillers, with Putin as the the ultimate malefactor bent on psychologically breaking them. Employing noirish two-tone animation to fill gaps in his footage, Jones never misses a dramatic beat, with the climax being Grozev’s father beingfound dead in mysterious circumstancesin March 2023; after an inconclusive autopsy, his body is cremated by Austrian authorities.Possibly, the film prioritises narrative over insight a touch too much. The overarching question is what motivates these rebels to continue down these paths of isolation, and how they justify putting their families in the firing line. But despite his lucid testimony Grozev, and his inner motivations, remain opaque. Elsewhere, Kara-Murza, finally freed as part of theGershkovich prisoner exchange, has a great rejoinder for the FSB agent who tells him bid farewell to the motherland: “I’m a historian by trade, and I know that I’ll be back – and it’ll be much quicker than you think.” You desperately hope he’s right, or at least he and his family are now secure in the US. But with Putin’s little helper now in the White House, it seems safe havens may be a thing of the past.Antidote is released in UK cinemas from 14 March, and is on Channel 4 on 27 March (as Kill List: Hunted by Putin’s Spies).Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsInvestigative journalismRussiaEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

The landscape is famously as flat as the local pancakes and picturesque mountains, forests and waterfalls are in short supply.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Head into the countryside south of Amsterdam, however, and you can find lovely walking routes amid a quintessentially Dutch landscape of green fields, windmills and waterways. Walks along the Amstel River, which flows north into Amsterdam, also offer an opportunity to follow in famous footsteps. Rembrandt van Rijn lived for much of his life close to the river, was fond of walking its banks and produced some beautiful pictures here. With Amsterdam about to celebrate its 750th birthday in June, it’s a good moment to see the city from another angle, along the waterway which gave the city its name.AmsterdamMy walk in Rembrandt’s footsteps begins in Ouderkerk aan de Amstel, a small town a few miles south of Amsterdam. Ouderkerk isn’t big but it’s exceedingly pleasant; a warren of narrow brick streets cradled by the river, with a tall church tower standing at the centre like an upturned drawing pin. I don’t linger long but take a moment to see theBeth Haim Jewish cemetery, where dozens of old gravestones tilt in the soft grass. Nearby, streets are filled with diggers piling sandbags, and signs warning:Let op! Drijfzand(Watch out! Quicksand) – a reminder that much of the area I’ll be walking through was reclaimed from the water over many centuries, and remains below sea level today.Leaving Ouderkerk, I walk north along a narrow gravel footpath that tracks the Amstel like a handrail. It is a glorious sunny day, with birds flitting in and out of the tall rushes on the riverbank, and rowers skimming across the water like skittery insects. Yet despite all this movement, the Amstel itself is as tranquil as a mill pond – in a land without hills, you can barely tell many waterways are moving.View image in fullscreenRembrandt statue and De Riekermolen windmill.Photograph: Robert vant Hoenderdaal/AlamyAs I walk north, the Amstel is at first lined with terrace houses but the landscape soon opens out, with raised riverbanks offering views across the emerald fields beyond. During Amsterdam’s Golden Age in the 17th century, many of the city’s wealthy merchants owned weekend homes here. Today, most of the older homes have been replaced by modern mansions, but there’s still one magnificent 18th-century creation left, the Oostermeer, with a sweeping gravel drive. I take a photo and resolve that if my little book on Amsterdam turns out to be a bestseller, I’ll buy a palace here too.I see a view that hasn’t changed much since Rembrandt etched it in 1641: a rumpled meadow, a slender church tower, and a small boat on the riverContinuing north, I pass a stone obelisk as high as a house, engraved with the wordsTerminus Proscriptionis. Studying my map, I realise it is abanpaal(ban pole), marking the outer boundary of Amsterdam, which any criminal banned from the city would be forbidden to pass. Rembrandt, as a notorious spendthrift and love rat, may have been lucky to have avoided being banished himself. A mile or so later, on a big bend in the river, there’s a pretty windmill next to a big statue of Rembrandt kneeling on the grass in hat and cape, sketching on a pad that rests on his knee. Looking south, I see a view that hasn’t changed much since Rembrandt etched it in 1641: a rumpled meadow, a slender church tower in the distance, and a small boat sailing along the river.Five miles after leaving Ouderkerk, I arrive in Amsterdam proper. After the tranquillity of the countryside, the bustle of the city comes as a shock. The narrow riverside trail is replaced by wide streets with clanging trams, joggers, cars and cyclists. Here, the Amstel is perhaps half as wide as the River Thames, and lined with big old sailing barges converted into houseboats. Rembrandt sketched another picture showing this area, known as the Omval, with a massive tree standing like a gnarled fist by the river. Things look rather different these days. Just after midday on a weekday, restaurant terraces overlooking the Amstel are already filled with people drinking white wine and eating expensive salads. The Dutch work some of theshortest hours in Europe, and it shows.View image in fullscreenThe Night Watch by Rembrandt.Photograph: Peter Horree/AlamyI continue north, past theH’ART museum, which will host a Rembrandt exhibition from 9 April. Then I cross the river over the stately Blauwbrug, or blue bridge, which isn’t blue. Rembrandt drewa famous view of the Amstel from the Blauwbrugin the late 1640s, now in the Rijksmuseum. Looking west I see the grand waterside home of Rembrandt’s patron Jan Six, who commissioned many works. If you ask nicely, many weeks in advance (via theSix Collection website), you may be allowed inside to see theportrait Rembrandt did of Jan Sixin 1654, now hanging so Six appears to be keeping a watchful eye on the river.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The space is dominated by theWaag, a big turreted building. It was here that Rembrandt created one of his most famous works,The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp, showing doctors dissecting the corpse of an executed criminal. Nearby, on the Nieuwe Doelenstraat, you can also see the spot where Rembrandt delivered his most famous work:The Night Watch.View image in fullscreenThe pub Sluyswacht (on the right) is close to the Rembrandthuis.Photograph: Christophe Cappelli/AlamyI walk south along the Sint Antoniesbreestraat. My final stop is hard to miss: in a street of ugly modern buildings there’s one beautiful 17th-century facade; a five-storey brick mansion with red shutters on the windows like the doors on an Advent calendar. This is the house where Rembrandt lived for nearly two decades, nowa museum. The interior is largely a modern reconstruction but it’s hard not to feel a shiver of excitement when you see the sunlit studio where he painted some of history’s most famous art.The museum closes and I decamp to theSluyswacht, a pub just across the street in a little lockkeeper’s cottage which looks as if it’s been lifted from the pages of a fairytale. This place is not quite as old as Rembrandt – it was built 26 years after he died – but it is surely one of most picturesque pubs in Europe. I sit outside by the canal, drink apilsjeof beer and eat a plate of cheese, and think: that Rembrandt, he had good taste.The Invention of Amsterdam, A History of Europe’s Greatest City in Ten Walks by Ben Coates is published by Scribe UK (£12.99).To support the Guardian and the Observer buy a copy atguardianbookshop.com.
