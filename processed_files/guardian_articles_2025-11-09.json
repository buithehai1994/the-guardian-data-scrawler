With these resignations, it has given inJane MartinsonThe corporation should have stood up to the Telegraph, Trump and the Tories. Now, its enemies know how little it takes for it to foldSun 9 Nov 2025 14.38 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Nov 2025 16.09 ESTShareThe resignation of the BBC’s director general,Tim Davie, over accusations of bias comes as a shock and leaves a gulf at the top of the corporation when it needs leadership most. Davie stressed that the decision was his alone – neither the board, nor even many of those who led the coordinated attack among rightwing press and politicians expected it.Now the resignations of both Davie and the CEO ofBBCNews, Deborah Turness, have shown that baying for blood gets results.The biggest shock is that this saga began just a week ago with the leak of a 19-page “devastating memo” from Michael Prescott, a former political journalist who spent three years as anexternal adviserto the broadcaster, published in the Telegraph. The dossier alleges BBC Panorama doctored a speech by Trump, making him appear to support the January 6 rioters, that its Arabic coverage privileged pro-Hamas views, and that a group of LGBTQ employees had excessive influence on coverage of sex and gender. The Telegraph wrote that the BBC’s very silence “proves there is a serious problem”. Meanwhile, the former UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s “blast” at Nick Robinson, the only BBC staffer to publicly fight back against the accusations, leads the Mail on Sunday, and Donald Trump’s press secretary has called the BBC “100% fake news”Leave to one side for now the direct allegations about specific failures of BBC coverage, and the BBC’s own baffling inability or unwillingness to defend itself over the past week. But the row obscures the context that explains what is, at the heart of the matter, a political campaign against the BBC that could act as a textbook example of how to confuse and undermine the kind of journalism that is, at the very least, aiming for impartiality in a sea of spin and distortion.Prescott stresses he has never been a member of a political party and that his views “do not come with any political agenda” in the introduction to his 8,000-word note. Yet each criticism of BBC coverage comes from the anti-progressive culture-war playbook.For example, he is “shocked” that after an hour-long Panorama documentary dealing with Trump and the January 6 insurgency, there was no “similar, balancing” programme about the Democrat presidential candidate, Kamala Harris. As someone who has spent years dealing with the issue of impartiality told me, this is an entirely wrongheaded and now discredited view of impartiality, the sort of view that led to airtime beinggiven to climate denial.Prescott also accuses the BBC of amplifying “issues of racism”. Yet his own argument and suggested source material undermines his own claims of neutrality. He cites a 2022 report byHistory Reclaimed, also published in the Telegraph, which highlights four BBC programmes with “an overly simplistic and distorted narrative about British colonial racism, slave-trading and its legacy”. While some of its members are senior Oxbridge academics, History Reclaimed’s website makes clear that the group was formed to counter “culture war” narratives in the media that suggest British history is shameful.Prescott remains “mystified” that his requests for BBC producers and editors to meet the report’s authors were ignored. Yet in its own review at the time, the BBC concluded that History Reclaimed “cherrypicking a handful of examples or highlighting genuine mistakes in thousands of hours of output on TV and radio does not constitute analysis and is not a true representation of BBC content”.Sadly, there has been no corresponding BBC response to the rehashed criticism in Prescott’s own extensive review of past complaints.None of this is to say that the BBC has not made mistakes. At the very least, the Panorama documentary appears to have included a bad and misleading edit of an hour-long Trump speech, which is unacceptable even if that speech was subsequently found to have encouraged insurrection. The BBC is expected to apologise on Monday over the Trump edit. That should have been enough.Prescott’s 10 years as chief political correspondent and then political editor of the Sunday Times must have also helped his laser focus on two issues in particular that have divided even the BBC’s biggest supporters. Its reporting in Gaza, specifically that of theBBC Arabic service– given greater prominence recently not just because of the war but because of cuts in BBC News – has wounded many in the Jewish community, while the BBC’s handling of trans rights has divided even its own staff.Yet pity the BBC that, while tiptoeing not always gracefully through these editorial minefields with thousands of hours of content, it has also to deal with enemies from within.Concerns about an apparentconflict of interestwere raised when Johnson appointed Prescott toadvise Ofcomover its new chair four years ago. Prescott, whose PR firm Hanover was involved in advising media companies such as Sky, has also been described as a friend of Robbie Gibb, a former Conservative government head of communications who joined the BBC board after helping to launch the rightwing news channel GB News. However, Prescott was allowed to continue in that role, and a government spokesperson said on Prescott’s behalfthat the appointmentwas “fair and open and there are no conflicts of interest”. He was later appointed external adviser to the BBC standards board.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

BBC sources tell me that the chair, Samir Shah, immediately ordered Peter Johnston, the director of editorial complaints and reviews, to work on a response and a briefing was discussed at the board on 16 October.So why has the BBC so far said nothing, apart from letting it be known that Shah is likely to apologise for the Trump edit when called to respond to the culture, media and sport committee tomorrow?Given the sheer volume of the content it airs and criticism it receives, the BBC can sometimes be forgiven for not wanting to stir passions further. But by spending days insisting that it did not comment on “leaked documents”, the corporation has simply looked weak and cowardly, just when it needs to be robust and brave. October Films, the independent production company that made the Trump Panorama, is said to be working on a film about Nigel Farage.With many of the criticisms already looked at and addressed internally, should it really take so long to come out with a response? These are difficult times for the BBC. About to enter into negotiations to renew its charter after more than a decade of licence-fee cuts, it is also caught in political and economic headwinds. Johnson’s threat tocancel his licence feecomes after300,000 more householdsdid so over the past year.Trump’s threat of a lawsuit against the BBC follows his successful cowing of the US media, with a succession of commercial broadcasters agreeing to pay damages on the flimsiest of charges. The BBC must be independent of government and political interference. But to do that, it needs the trust of everyone who pays for its services.In his resignation letter, Davie pleads for a better future after 20 years at an organisation he loves. “We should champion [the BBC],” he writes. “Not weaponise it.” It feels as if this plea is already too late.Jane Martinson is professor of financial journalism at City St George’s and a member of the board of the Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian Media Group.

If only it hadn’t been bumped down the schedules because of StrictlyFrances RyanSun 9 Nov 2025 14.10 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Nov 2025 18.04 ESTShareAs I watch a leopard hunt in Kingdom, the BBC’s latest David Attenborough-narrated documentary, I find myself thinking about aYouGov surveyfrom a few years ago that found that half of Britons wouldn’t take a free trip to the moon, with 11% turning it down because “there isn’t enough to see and do”. As well as it providing a fantastic insight into the great British public’s psyche (would outer space be better if it had Alton Towers?), I can’t help but wonder if it also explains the pressure that TV commissioners feel under to find new ways to interest the pesky human race in sights that would previously have been greeted with wonder.Back in 2017,Blue Planet IIwas the most-watched programme of the year, with 14.1 million viewers tuning in to see dolphins surf on prime time. Today, the six-part Kingdom has been bumped to the teatime slot, and finding out which Strictly celeb’s rumba has been voted the most mediocre is deemed more important to the schedule.Still, it is not as if Attenborough, and the enormous team behind him, have stopped trying. Billed by the BBC as “one of the most ambitious projects” ever undertaken by its Natural History Unit, Kingdom was filmed over the course of five years and has an impressive scope. But it focuses on the lives of four African animal families – leopards, hyenas, wild dogs and lions – as they jostle for dominance in a fertile river valley in Zambia.It is essentially Game of Thrones if Cersei was a hyena and everyone was competing for some dinner. Watching the opening title sequence, in which images of the various animal dynasties are superimposed over a map of their territory, you half expect Sean Bean’s face to pop up on the northern border.Winter is coming! No, sorry, that’s some leopards. We are introduced to Olimba, undisputed queen of the valley for a decade, who is teaching her son Moyo, and daughter, Mutima, about danger at the local mud bath. As Moyo – courageous but quite daft – wanders through the water oblivious to a hippopotamus camouflaged beneath, Mutima looks on from the sidelines with a stare many sisters will recognise. Disaster is averted this time (we’re only 11 minutes in, after all) but the producers may as well hold up a sign that reads “FORESHADOWING”. Viewers with a sensitive disposition should not get attached to Moyo/Jon Snow.Shots of elephants, giraffes and zebras congregating at the river are striking. It’s as if we’re spying on utopiaAs we watch Olimba hunt to feed her cubs, new arrival Storm – a wild dog and rival queen – enters with her pack stage left to get the prey for herself. Outnumbered, Olimba has no choice but to hide from the dogs in a treetop; a humbling sight for such a majestic creature.If you’re siding with the leopards at this point, nature conveniently provides a plot twist. As Storm enjoys her feast, hyenas – a species typically twice the size of wild dogs – turn up to try to steal her spoils. Suddenly you find yourself swapping allegiances. Team Wild Dog! But also Team Leopard.Saying that, I can only respect pregnant hyena Tandala. While her family are off nabbing prey, she keeps out of the drama, sunbathing by the water with her eyes half shut. Anthropomorphism risks aside, by the time Tandala is hiding her snack in the river to keep it away from her annoying relatives, you can’t help but see your mum storing the Celebrations under the bed because your dad won’t stop eating the Maltesers Teasers.View image in fullscreenTeam wild dog! One of Storm’s older sons greets the newest pups.Photograph: BBC Studios/Anna PlaceWildlife shows often spotlight the innate quest for survival, and Kingdom puts it at the forefront. But the shots of supporting characters – from elephants and giraffes to zebras – congregating at the river are some of the most striking, as if we are spying on utopia.The third act brings another pack to threaten the leopard’s reign, and with it, the most emotive scene of the hour. When Moyo goes missing, Olimba searches day and night for her son. By morning, Moyo has been found dead, his wounds likely caused by a lion.We have been privileged to see much of this before. And yet that’s the thing about the Attenborough franchise in 2025. No matter how many times viewers have watched similar chains of events, it is still deeply moving to hear a mother call for her child and know he is not coming back.The episode ends with a cliffhanger, when Storm’s new litter are surrounded by a group of lions. Seven puppies hide in a den but one is left behind. Attenborough teases the next episode: “Can Storm rescue her pup in time or will it have to face the lions alone?”Repetitive? Perhaps. Awe-inspiring, exhilarating and affecting? Certainly.Kingdom aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now in the UK, and will air on the Nine Network in Australia at a later dateExplore more on these topicsNature documentariesTV reviewDavid AttenboroughTelevisionWildlifereviewsShareReuse this content"

Out of the window she saw a flat, shadeless landscape. First-day jitters had Guo questioning what she was doing there.The former consultant had left corporate America to attempt something no woman had completed: a single, continuous hike of the Continental Divide Trail (CDT) and the Great Divide Trail (GDT) in one calendar year.The rare linking up of the two trails – which traverse New Mexico’s Chihuahuan Desert, Colorado’s high-elevation passes, Old Faithful in Yellowstone national park in Wyoming, the alpine scenery of Montana and Glacier national park and the remote backcountry of Banff, Canada – captivated tens of thousands of viewersonlineas Guo recorded and edited her daily journeys, while keeping a pace of around 48km (30 miles) each day.View image in fullscreenJessica Guo.Photograph: Joseph Scheller Photography/The Montana StandardShe completed the epic, five-month-long trek in September, becomingthe first female hiker to do so– and decided to leave her six-figure job for good to spend more time helping others get on trail.“I didn’t start out as some crazy endurance athlete and I really think of myself as a normal person,” she said of the 5,698km (3,541-mile) hike, which has been completed by only three men since 2005. “I was scared about sleeping outside alone in the woods or hiking alone or in the dark when I first started backpacking nearly a decade ago.”Her short, narrated videos, which feature landscapes ranging from hot deserts to snowy peaks, were originally meant for family, friends and other hikers. But it wasn’t long before a larger community became invested in them; she now counts nearly 50,000 followerson her Instagramaccount. Guo documented her progress each day, editing on the go during easier sections of the trail, and would text the files to her brother when she had cell service so he could upload them on her behalf.Guo, who turned 30 on the trail, battled everything from swarms of mosquitoes and thick mud and snow to rocky ridgelines and dense forests (spotting bears, caribou and 193 species of birds along the way) as she gained 179,450 meters (588,747ft) in elevation – the equivalent of hiking Everest 20 times.On 19 September, day 152, Guo reached the end of her journey, posting an emotionalvideofrom the remote Kakwa Lake in the Rocky Mountains in British Columbia, Canada. “If there’s something out there that calls to you, I hope you listen,” she said. “Give yourself permission to do the thing.”‘It’s hard when you don’t see people who look like you’Although Guo was raised in a suburb outside of Seattle, where she was regularly exposed to nature during hiking and camping trips with her family, it took many years for her to give herself the permission to do something extraordinary.It was on a pivotal trip to Panama after high school, which she earned by selling Girl Scout cookies, that Guo learned of the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), which spans the US border with Mexico to the Canadian border and was made famous by Cheryl Strayed’s 2012 memoir Wild. She liked the idea of hiking through her home state, but was intimidated.View image in fullscreenThe high route of Wyoming’s Wind River Range.Photograph: Jessica Guo“I think a lot of women tend to underestimate what they can do, and feel like we have to be overly prepared,” she said. “I later realized you don’t have to feel like you’re 100% ready to go after it. We’re not really conditioned to think that way as women.”The percentage of women hiking and backpacking has been increasing over the years. In 2018, women representedone-thirdof thru-hikers – people who hike a long-distance trail end to end in one expedition – but 2024Appalachian Trail(AT) andPCTsurveys showed nearly half of all long-distance thru-hikers identified as women. Even so, Guo has encountered “benevolent sexism” – men underestimating her capabilities or acting as protectors – both on the trail and in the comments sections of her posts. A few people on the trail seemed surprised that she was an Asian woman, and other Asian hikers have told Guo they have been mistaken for her.“I hope we have more and more diversity to the point where you don’t have to comment on it,” said Guo, who is the daughter of Chinese immigrants. “It’s hard when you don’t see people who look like yourself doing the things you want to be doing.”Guo finally made her 10-year dream of hiking the PCT come true in 2023. She picked up her trail nickname, “Stitches”, after a branch impaled her calf and she needed six stitches, and another incident involving a sharp rock where her knee received three stitches.From post-trail depression back to the trailThe joy of her accomplishment was short-lived as she quickly experienced post-trail depression and, later, a severe clinical depression after returning to her day-to-day life as a design strategist and facilitator at a consulting firm. “You’ve just been in this place where you’re getting dopamine every day, being outside and tuned into nature and then coming back to work and a 9-to-5 and being sedentary,” she said. “It’s a big shift.”View image in fullscreenGuo at the northern terminus of the GDT at Kakwa Lake in Kakwa provincial park, British Columbia.Photograph: Jessica GuoHer doctor told Guo she needed to get back on trail to remember who she was.Last year, she took medical leave and hiked the Colorado Trail (CT) in about a month. “That was really empowering because previously I wasn’t eating, I wasn’t sleeping, I wasn’t moving outside. I wasn’t doing all the things that keep you alive and well, but those are also the things I have to do when I’m on trail,” she said. “I have to move forward, I have to eat, I have to sleep.”Seeing the progress she made on the CT helped Guo heal from depression and find a new dream. That’s when she came up with the idea of linking the CDT and GDT, but found there was virtually no information available about doing both hikes. She decided she would blaze her own trail and document it so future hikers could follow her example.Guo’s CDT and GDT hikes were largely solitary, which gave her time to think and write about her experiences, which included witnessing the effects of climate change first-hand.In one post, Guo wrote: “I did not start this hike intending to talk about climate, but it is untenable, the effect we are having. You may not see it in your homes because you turn on the tap and clean fresh water comes out. And I am at the source and I see the glaciers dwindling. I see that there is supposed to be a glacier here, but there is nothing. And that scares me.”She also spoke about the current threats topublic landsandthe roadless rule, which protects the US’s backcountry recreation areas. “The whole point of being out there is to be in that isolated space,” she said, “and I think it’s worth preserving.”View image in fullscreenJessica Guo on the trail, south of Helena, Montana.Photograph: Joseph Scheller Photography/The Montana StandardWhen Guo saw the end of the GDT trail, she was overwhelmed with emotion and began to cry.“I thought about how I had walked along the ridgeline of North America that is the source of the water nourishing so many millions of people in two countries, nurturing so many millions of creatures and plants and ecosystems,” she said. “It was humbling, and reaching the terminus the next day, I felt joy, relief, grief and pride. It was bittersweet to know that the end was here.”Explore more on these topicsWalkingHealthMental healthHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the foreground of that photo was a familiar blond head: Giorgia Meloni.During her three years as the Italian prime minister, Meloni has moved beyond her hard-right populism, not to mention her fascism-adjacent origins, to earn at least the respect of other leaders – Keir Starmer among them – for her pragmatism and flexibility. Among those watching this transformation from the sidelines will be the man hoping to be Starmer’s replacement:Nigel Farage.If campaigning is, as the political truism goes, conducted in poetry while government is prose, this is doubly so for insurgents and outsiders, whose careers are built on promising rapid and straightforward solutions to seemingly intractable national troubles.View image in fullscreenGiorgia Meloni has become respected among other world leaders for her pragmatism.Photograph: Stefano Carofei/Sintesi/SIPA/ShutterstockWhen this unstoppable force of rhetoric meets the immovable object of actual government, the results can be turbulent, as with the currency bailouts and increased poverty of Javier Milei’s Argentina, or the stability-shedding chaos of Donald Trump’s impetuous policymaking.Although Meloni arrived in power as the overtly far-right leader of a party, Brothers of Italy, with neofascist roots, she has tempered her ideologywith realism and compromise, for example mixing plans to process asylum claims in Albania with a marked increase in work visas to address labour shortages.As shown by the G7 photo, she has also been able to work closely with a series of very different world leaders, among them Starmer, helped by a relaxed manner and proficiency in English, French and Spanish.So could Farage pull off a similar trick? In one sense he already has, also dragging a hard-right party from support once measured in the few percent to mainstream popularity.There are some ways in which Farage’s ideology has remained fairly consistent, not least – and this is one very clear difference from Meloni – his consistent refusal to ally with openly far-right groups, all the way from shunning the British National party in the early days of Ukip to his more recentdistancing fromElon Musk and the far-right agitator Tommy Robinson.“I don’t see Nigel’s principles as having changed one little jot,” said Gawain Towler, who was Farage’s press chief for years and is closely involved with Reform UK.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer talks to Emmanuel Macron, Giorgia Meloni, Mark Carney and Friedrich Merz at the G7 summit in Canada this June.Photograph: Simon Dawson/No 10 Downing StreetThis has not meant a never-changing worldview, Towler argued, saying the “blood and thunder Thatcherism” acquired by Farage during his period as a metals trader in the City during the 1980s was tempered by “25 years going around the poor parts of our country and realising that Thatcherism didn’t work well for everybody”.In a closer parallel to Meloni, Farage does very clearly shape his message to his audience. One example is the repeatedairing of tropes and conspiracy theoriesassociated with the far right and antisemitism in US interviews over several years, rhetoric now firmly abandoned and – Farage hopes – largely forgotten.He has also shown himself happy to junk policies which could hamper Reform’s rise, notably the recent move todrop £90bn in planned annual tax cuts, promised only last year.There is, however, much more to running a government than ideological flexibility. It is also a question of personality and experience. And this is where the differences between Farage and Meloni become more stark.For all that she is still a relative newcomer to the world stage, Meloni has been a member of Italy’s parliament for nearly 20 years and first served as a minister in a Silvio Berlusconi-led coalition government in 2008.In contrast, while Farage is undoubtedly a political veteran – he was a founding member of Ukip more than three decades ago – almost all his experience, even in the European parliament, involved being the undisputed head of a relatively small group of outsiders.Some former colleagues question how well he may adapt to the endless compromises and delegation involved in running a national government.“Nigel was not at all collegiate back in the day,” said someone who saw him operate as an MEP. “It was his way or the highway, and he’d consider genuine disagreement to be treachery. The question is, has he changed?”According to Robert Ford, a professor of political science at Manchester University, any comparison with Meloni “falls down if you actually look into her biography, because she had done time in government before she headed her own party”.He went on: “It’s important to remember that the question of how much Farage is willing to compromise to get into power is different from the question of whether or not he’ll be good at the compromises necessary.“She has been in parliament for years and years. He has been in parliament for all of one year and has already managed to lose two of his MPs.“The problem that Farage has long had organisationally is the only kind of organisation he has ever been very effective at running is one where he basically is a sort of autocracy, where his word is holy writ.“Whenever his parties have had any kind of a more differentiated internal structure, he has ended up getting into massive arguments with everybody and marginalising people, and splits have happened. The Brexit party and Reform were explicitly set up with a goal of, essentially, if anyone disagrees with Nigel, Nigel wins. In government that model doesn’t work.”Meloni, Ford noted, “has had a lot of experience at bargaining, compromise, negotiation – the more subtle arts of manoeuvring yourself into a position where you win and get what you want. None of this is necessarily familiar political terrain for Farage.”Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageGiorgia MeloniItalynewsShareReuse this content"

Theplanetary health diet, introduced in 2019 and updated last month, recommends that everyone eat a portion every day (unless you have an allergy). Alongside eating more fruit, vegetables, whole grains and legumes, and fewer animal products and sugary foods, this couldhelp prevent 40,000 early deaths a dayacross the world, as well as slash food-related greenhouse gas emissions.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Yet according to Prof Sarah Berry, thechief scientist at Zoe, many don’t eat any nuts at all. In the UK, the average consumption is 6g a day.Romanian researchers foundhigher levels of nut consumption in Canada, some African countries and some regions of Europe and the Middle East, and lower levels in South America. But overall, they said: “Consumers may not have a comprehensive understanding of the multiple benefits that nuts might bring.”In particular, people are often put off nuts because they are high in fat. But in fact, say the researchers, “Nuts have been found to have positive health impacts, such as the potential to manage obesity and decrease the occurrence of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, several types of cancer and other chronic diseases associated with food.”What explains this apparent paradox – and how can you get the most out of your daily peanuts, pecans or pistachios?First, what counts as a nut?While there are botanical quibbles, the 2024 bookNut Consumption and its Usefulness in the Modern Worldincludes “tree nuts or fruit seeds with an edible grain and an indigestible hard shell”. In culinary terms, that most commonly means almonds, brazil nuts, cashews, chestnuts, hazelnuts, macadamias, peanuts, pecans, pine nuts, pistachios and walnuts.How many of them should I eat, and how often?“The recommended portion size is 30g every day, or at least five days a week. That’s a handful, so it’s easy to remember,” saysDr Sze-Yen Tan,asenior lecturer in nutrition science at Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia. It’s also the size of one of those little packs of peanuts you get in pubs. If you prefer nut butter, then it’s two tablespoons. Tan, who has authoreda number of studiesinto the benefits of nuts, says he eats them almost every day – usually cashews or peanut butter.Why are they good for me?View image in fullscreenUnique benefits … nuts keep your cardiovascular system healthy.Photograph: Adela Stefan/Getty Images“Nuts are little nutritional powerhouses,” says Berry. “They are extremely nutrient-dense, packed with healthy fats, protein and fibre that can help stabilise your blood sugar, energy and hunger levels. They are also packed with micronutrients and vitamins.”Eating nuts can reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease, she continues. “Studies have shownthat people who eat a small handful of mixed nuts regularly have a significantly lower rate of heart attack, stroke and death from heart disease compared with a control group who were told to reduce their fat intake. So something as simple as adding a few nuts to your breakfast or snack can have big long-term benefits.”And it doesn’t take long to see an improvement: “My study showedthat swapping typical UK snacks for nuts can improve blood vessel function and lower cholesterol in as little as six weeks, resulting in a predicted 30% reduction in cardiovascular disease risk,” says Berry.Are some nuts better than others?“Nutritionally speaking, no matter which you prefer, all nuts are fantastic. Every serving contains unsaturated fats to support heart health, protein for satiety, fibre to aid digestion and feed beneficial gut bacteria, and polyphenols for their antioxidant properties,” says Berry.“However, some types of nuts offer unique benefits. Brazil nuts, for example, are the best source of selenium; just one or two a day can meet your requirements for this essential element that helps fight cell damage. Walnuts contain the highest amount of the plant-based omega-3 fatty acid (ALA) among all nuts, which supports brain health and provides anti-inflammatory effects.” This makes them a great alternative for anyone who doesn’t eat oily fish.View image in fullscreenEat the rainbow … pistachios.Photograph: Aniko Hobel/Getty Images“The colourful pigments in pistachios are important forprotecting eye health,” continues Berry. “And almonds are some of the most nutrient-dense nuts. My own research shows that eating them instead of typical snacks may even improve cardiac function when we are under mental stress.”Tan adds peanuts to the list: “They contain high levels of vitamin E.”In summary, says Berry, “Choosing a diverse mix of nuts is really the best course of action to ensure you get all the different health advantages they can provide.”Are flavoured nuts still beneficial?“Ideally, opt for plain or lightly roasted nuts most of the time, as many flavoured versions are loaded with added salt and sugar,” says Berry. “But healthy eating isn’t about perfection. If you love flavoured nuts, try making your own at home by roasting them with spices or herbs – or just buy the readymade ones every once in a while.”What about nuts covered in chocolate?View image in fullscreenNutritiousanddelicious!Photograph: Iryna Olkhova/Getty ImagesHappily, “including chocolate-covered nuts in your diet – especially dark chocolate (70% cocoa or more) – can be a smart choice compared with skipping nuts altogether,” says Sammie Gill, a registered dietitian andBritish Dietetic Associationspokesperson. “Dark chocolate provides greater health benefits than milk chocolate due to its higher polyphenol content and lower sugar levels, making it the more nutritious option. That said, eating snacks you enjoy matters too, so if you prefer milk chocolate nuts, have them. As with anything, the key is to be mindful of portion sizes. It’s all about how much and how often. Chocolate-covered nuts strike a nice balance between enjoyment and nutrition.”Even chocolate-nut spread can be beneficial, Gill says – she recommends choosing one with a high nut and low sugar content, such asPip & Nut’s Chocolate Hazelnut Spread(39% almonds, 24% hazelnuts) orNut Blend’s Cacao, Cashew & Almond Butter. It’s well worth checking the label; some brands contain as little as 13% nuts.Nuts are high in fat and calories. Won’t eating them every day make me put on weight?“It’s a common misconception that eating nuts can make you put on weight,” says Berry. “People who eat nuts regularlyoften have lower body weightandless body fat. That’s partly because nuts are high in fibre and healthy fats, which help you feel full for longer – and less inclined to reach for the bag of crisps later on. But most importantly,we have shownthatnuts have a special structurewhich means that about 25% of the calories remain undigested, so they are not as high-calorie as the back-of-pack labelling would suggest. This is also great news for our gut microbiome, as lots of intact nut cells end up in our large intestine providing great fuel for our microbes to feast on.”Don’t be put off by the fat in nuts, says Gill. “Nuts are mistakenly perceived as unhealthy due to their high fat content (40-80%, depending on the type of nut). But ‘fat’ is a very broad term. Fat is an essential nutrient and there are different types. Healthy, unsaturated fats should make up the majority of all the fat we consume. The good news? Nuts primarily contain polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats. For example, the majority of fats in peanuts – around 75-80% – are healthy, unsaturated fats.”Tan is categorical. As long as you eat the recommended portion size, “All types of studies have shown that including nuts in our diet doesn’t lead to weight gain.”Can I eat too many?“It’s very easy to overeat nuts,” says Tan – especially the salted and flavoured kinds. “Prepackaged nuts can help.” (I think that’s true – somehow, I’m less likely to open a second 25gsnack packthan I am to reach for another handful from a big bag.) But don’t worry too much if you have a second helping. “The main problem with overeating is simply the excess calories,” Tan continues. “Even though, for example, Brazil nuts are high in selenium, you’re not at risk of toxic levels.”Gill makes the point that eating too much of any one food, including nuts, isn’t ideal. “Chances are you’re missing out on other key nutrients because you’re crowding out other foods and limiting overall diet diversity.” If you can stick to a handful of nuts a day, you’ll get all the benefits without any downsides.Should I buy skin-on nuts?View image in fullscreenChoose skin-on nuts where possible.Photograph: sergeyryzhov/Getty Images/iStockphotoBerry says yes, when possible and if you enjoy them. “The skins of nuts, including almonds and peanuts, contain many of the protective plant compounds – such as polyphenols and antioxidants – that help to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress. Around60% of the skin is pure dietary fibre, which is essential for comfortable digestion and keeping your good gut bacteria happy.” Tan warns that the skin of some nuts can become bitter when roasted, though, so you may prefer blanched nuts sometimes.Do I need to soak my nuts?“Soaking or ‘activating’ nuts is a bit of a myth,” says Tan. “The idea was to remove some of the antinutrients [compounds that interfere with the absorption of nutrients], but studies show it doesn’t, and it can cause some food safety issues. That said, soaking can soften nuts for older people with dental problems.”Gill agrees: “Soaking nuts is best done for personal preference in taste and texture, as nutritional changes – such as minor alterations in mineral and phytate content – are generally negligible.”How do I cook with nuts?View image in fullscreenMeera Sodha’s beans with gnocchi Trapanese.Photograph: Louise Hagger/The GuardianIf you tire of sprinkling them on your porridge or eating them as a snack, there are lots of ways to cook with nuts. “Nuts are very important in vegetarian and vegan diets to help meet protein requirements,” says Tan. The Guardian’s Meera Sodha uses them widely in her meat-free recipes. My recent favourites includetahini beans topped with pine nuts;walnut and tempeh noodles;lentils with chestnuts, red wine and cavolo nero; andleek, pistachio and jalapeño galettes. Sodha also uses cashews in avegan mac’n’cheese; almonds in apesto Trapanese with gnocchi; and peanut butter in aquick noodle sauce. Finally, herdark chocolate, date and pretzel slicesalso contain 100g of brazil nuts.Are other nut-based products worth buying?“Nut butters, nut milks and nut oils are a perfectly healthy addition to your daily diet,” says Gill. “I’d recommend a nut butter with as few ingredients as possible – look for jars that say ‘100% nuts’ on the label.” Tan says the most benefits come from whole nuts. “But for older people who may find them difficult to eat, nut butter can be really beneficial.”There is an ever-growing range of nut milks available, from almond and cashew to hazelnut and pistachio. “Many nut-based milks are fortified with vitamins to better match the nutritional content of cow’s milk,” says Gill.Should I give nuts to my children?In the UK,NHS adviceis that whole nuts should not be given to children under the age of five due to the risk of choking. Ground and crushed nuts, and nut butters, can be given to babies from six months old.View image in fullscreenPeanut butter makes a fine sandwich.Photograph: Elizabethsalleebauer/Getty Images/RooM RF“Research indicates that tree nut allergies have increased in recent decades, with children generally showing a higher prevalence compared with adults,” says Gill. “It’s now widely accepted that babies should be introduced to allergenic foods – such as peanuts – at around six months old to help reduce the risk of developing allergies later on in life. Delaying introduction beyond six to 12 months may increase the risk.”She adds: “Direct ingestion is the most common trigger of allergic reactions. Studies have shown that non-ingestion exposure – such as skin contact or inhalation of airborne nut particles – is very rare.” Of course, if you are ever asked not to eat nuts – on a plane with a severely allergic passenger, for example – then don’t.Nuts are so expensive. How can I afford to eat them daily?Peanuts tend to be the best value. For example,Tescohas 500g of redskin peanuts for £2.30.With more expensive nuts, look out for “splits” (cashew nuts) and pieces (brazil nuts, walnuts, pecans), which are cheaper than whole nuts.If you can, buy in bulk. For example,Grape Treehas 1kg of mixed nuts (walnuts, almonds, cashews and peanuts) for £9.99.Look in the baking and world food aisles in supermarkets, where nuts are often cheaper than in the snack aisle.Take advantage of promotions.Holland & Barrett, for example, usually has three-for-two deals on nuts, including pricey pistachios and macadamias.Stock up on packs of cooked chestnuts in January – they are often reduced to clear after Christmas.Pine nuts are undeniably expensive. The cheapest I could find were fromAldi(£1.69 for 60g) andAsda(£3.36 for 100g).

I had accompanied her – my dear friend – to a recent doctor’s appointment. She is in her 70s, lives alone while navigating multiple chronic health issues, and has been getting short of breath climbing the front stairs to her apartment. In the exam room, she spoke slowly and self-consciously, the way people often do when they are trying to describe their bodies and anxieties to strangers. Midway through her description of how she had been feeling, the doctor clicked his mouse and a block of text began to bloom across the computer monitor.The clinic had adopted an artificial-intelligence scribe, and it was transcribing and summarizing the conversation in real time. It was also highlighting keywords, suggesting diagnostic possibilities and providing billing codes. The doctor, apparently satisfied that his computer had captured an adequate description of Pamela’s chief complaint and symptoms, turned away from us and began reviewing the text on the screen as Pamela kept speaking.When the appointment was over, as a physician myself and anthropologist interested in the evolving culture of medicine, I asked if I could glance at the AI-generated note. The summary was surprisingly fluid and accurate. But it did not capture the catch in Pamela’s voice when she mentioned the stairs, the flicker of fear when she implied that she now avoided them and avoided going out, the unspoken connection to Pamela’s traumatic relation to her own mother’s death that the doctor never elicited.Soon, not using AI to help determine diagnoses or treatments could be seen as malpracticeCraig SpencerScenes like this are becoming increasingly common. Physicians, for generations, have resisted new technologies that threatened their authority or unsettled established practice. But artificial intelligence is breaking that tradition by sweeping into clinical practice faster than almost any tool before it. Two-thirds ofAmerican physicians– a 78% jump from the year prior – and 86% ofhealth systemsused artificial intelligence as part of their practice in 2024. “AI will be as common in healthcare as the stethoscope,”predictsDr Robert Pearl, the former CEO of Permanente Medical Group, one of the largest physician groups in the country. As my colleague Craig Spencerhas observed: “Soon, not using AI to help determine diagnoses or treatments could be seen as malpractice.”Policymakers and aligned business interests promise AI willsolve physician burnout,lower healthcare costsandexpand access. Entrepreneurstout itas the great equalizer, bringing high-quality care to people excluded from existing systems. Hospital and physician leaders such as Dr Eric Topol have hailed AI asthe means by which humanity will finally be restoredto clinical practice; according to thiswidely embraced argument, it will liberate doctors fromdocumentation drudgeryand allow them to finally turn away from their computer screens and look patients in the eye. Meanwhile, patients are already making use of AI chatbots as supplements to – or substitutes for – doctors in what many see as a democratization of medical knowledge.The problem is that when it is installed in a health sector that prizes efficiency, surveillance and profit extraction, AI becomes not a tool for care and community but simply another instrument for commodifying human life.It is true that large language models can churn through mountains of medical literature, generate tidy summaries, and even outperform human physicians on diagnostic reasoning tasks in some studies. Last month, a new artificial intelligence system from OpenEvidence became the first AI toscore 100%on the United States Medical Licensing Exam. Research suggests AI can read radiologic images with accuracy rivaling human specialists, detect skin cancers from smartphone photos, and flag early signs of sepsis in hospitalized patients faster than clinical teams. During the Covid-19 pandemic, AI models were deployed to predict surges and allocate scarce resources, fueling hopes that similar systems could optimize everything from ICU beds to medication supply chains.What makes AI so compelling is not simply faith in technology but the way it suggests we can improve medicine by leapfrogging the difficult work of structural change to confront disease-causing inequality, corporate interests and oligarchic power.The rise of end times fascism | Naomi Klein and Astra TaylorRead moreThe US is the most medicalized country on Earth. Incentivized by profit, it spends roughly twice as much per capita on healthcare as other high-income nations, while simultaneously excluding millions from it and suffering –across all income levels– from far higher rates of preventable disease, disability and death. At the same time,public health scholarshave longarguedthatmedicine alone cannot fixwhat ails us at a population level. Instead, much more attention and public investment must be directed towardsnon-medical social carethat is essential for preventing disease, lowering preventable healthcare needs and costs, and enabling medical interventions to be effective.For many, tackling the perversity of American healthcare feels out of reach as the US lurches ever further into authoritarianism. In this context, AI is offered as a balm not because it addresses root causes of abysmal US public health, but because it allows policymakers and corporations to gloss over them.This faith in AI also reflects a misunderstanding of care itself, a misunderstanding decades in the making in the service of an idea now treated as an unquestionable good: evidence-based medicine (EBM).Emerging in the 1990swith the unassailable goal of improving care, EBM challenged practices based on habit and tradition by insisting decisions be grounded in rigorous research, ideally randomized controlled trials. First championed at McMaster University by physicians David Sackett and Gordon Guyatt, EBM quickly hardened into orthodoxy, embedded in curricula, accreditation standards and performance metrics that reshaped clinical judgment into compliance with statistical averages and confidence intervals. The gains were real: effective therapies spread faster, outdated ones were abandoned, and an ethic of scientific accountability took hold.But as the model transformed medicine, it narrowed the scope of clinical encounters. The messy, relational and interpretive dimensions of care – the ways physicians listen, intuit and elicit what patients may not initially say – were increasingly seen as secondary to standardized protocols. Doctors came to treat not singular people but data points. Under pressure for efficiency, EBM ossified into an ideology: “best practices” became whatever could be measured, tabulated and reimbursed. The complexity of patients’ lives was crowded out by metrics, checkboxes and algorithms. What began as a corrective to medicine’s biases paved the way for a new myopia: the conviction that medicine can and should bereduced to numbers.View image in fullscreenThe loss of the unsaidThe uses of AI do not just affect how we listen but also how we think and speak about ourselves, particularly as patients. Not long ago, a young woman came to see me, in my capacity as a psychiatrist, for chronic fatigue and associated experiences of sadness, anxiety and loss. She had experienced many rounds of dismissal by other doctors to whom she had appealed for help. Along the way, she developed strategies to try to avoid the experiences of humiliation she associated with doctors’ offices. One of those strategies: using ChatGPT to refine her narrative of herself. In the week leading up to her appointment with me, she had already told her story at least 10 times to the ChatGPT app she had installed on her phone. She had described her headaches, her racing heart in the early morning, the exhaustion that did not ease with rest. Each time, the bot responded in calm, fluent medical language, naming diagnostic possibilities and suggesting next steps. She refined her answers with each attempt, learning which words elicited which responses, as if she were studying for an exam.When she spoke to me, she used the same phrasing ChatGPT had given back to her: precise, clinical, flattened language largely stripped of affect or reference to her personal history, relationships and desires. Her deep fears were now encased in borrowed phrases, translated into a format she thought I would recognize as legitimate medical concerns, take seriously and address.It is true that her efforts made bureaucratic documentation easy. But much else was lost in the process. Her own uncertainty, distrust of her own self-perception and body, and her life history and idiosyncratic way of making sense of her suffering had been sanded away, leaving a smooth, ready-made medical discourse ready for transcription and transmission to pharmacists and insurance companies. In the hands of a clinician practicing EBM predicated on symptom scales, a reflexive prescription for antidepressants or stimulants – or a battery of tests for endocrine or autoimmune diseases – might have seemed the natural response.But those interventions, while perhaps later appropriate, would have skated over the deeper social and personal roots of her exhaustion. My patient’s AI-distorted narrative of herself thus not only obscured her experience but it also risked directing her care down a path of algorithmic pseudo-fixes that carry considerable risk of unintended harm.AI views both suffering and care as computational problemsThis encounter has been replicated in various forms with several other patients I have met over the last year as AI tools have rapidly infiltrated everyday life. One man in his late 60s, retired after a lucrative business career, divorced, estranged from his two adult sons and enmeshed in an abusive relationship came to me struggling with profound loneliness, regret and severe alcohol dependence, punctuated by panic attacks so severe he feared he might die alone of a heart attack in his downtown high-rise condo. Before seeing me, he had spent weeks using ChatGPT as a therapist to great effect, he told me. He spent hours every day writing to it about his symptoms and past, and taking comfort in its consistently complimentary replies that assured him he had been wronged by others in his life.ChatGPT had become not only his counselor but his main source of companionship. By the time we met, he fluently named his attachment style and the personality disorders ChatGPT had assigned to his family members, and repeated treatment suggestions – none of which addressed his daily consumption of a fifth of vodka. When I asked how he was feeling, he hesitated, then looked down at his phone in his hand as if to check whether his words matched what the psychological profile ChatGPT had laid out for him. The machine had substituted for both his voice and the human connection he craved.We risk entering a perverse loop: machines are supplying the language with which patients relay their suffering, and doctors are using machines to record and respond to that suffering. This cultivates what psychologists call “cognitive miserliness”, or a tendency to default to the most readily available answer rather than engage in critical inquiry or self-reflection. By outsourcing thought, and ultimately the most intimate definitions of ourselves to AI, doctors and patients risk becoming yet further alienated from one another.In this trajectory we can see the evolution of what Michel Foucault described in The Birth of the Clinic as the “medical gaze” – the separation and isolation of the diseased body from the lived experience of the person and their social environment. Where the 19th-century gaze fragmented the patient into lesions and signs visible to the clinician, and the late 20th-century evidence-based gaze translated patients into odds ratios and treatment protocols, the 21st-century algorithmic gaze dissolves both patient and doctor alike into never-ending streams of automated data. AI views both suffering and care as computational problems.The arguments in support of this transformation of the clinic are familiar. Human physicians misdiagnose, while algorithms can catch subtle patterns invisible to the eye. Humans forget the latest science; algorithms can absorb every new article the instant it is published. Physicians burn out, but algorithms never tire. Such claims are true in a narrow sense. But the leap from these advantages to a wholesale embrace of AI as medicine’s future depends on dangerously simplistic assumptions.The first is that AI is more objective than human physicians. In reality, AI is no less biased; it is merely biased differently, and in ways harder to detect. Models rely on existing datasets, which reflectdecades of systemic inequities: fromracial biasesbaked into kidney and lung-function tests to the underrepresentation of women and minorities in clinical trials. Pulse oximeters, for example,systematically underestimate hypoxemiain people with darker skin tones; during the Covid pandemic, these errorsfed into triage algorithms, delaying care for Black patients.Race-based correctionsfor kidney function long influenced transplant eligibility across the country. Once such biases are embedded in protocols, they persist for years.These problems are compounded by the assumption that more data automatically translates to better care. But no amount of data will repair underfunded clinics, reverse physician shortages or protect patients from predatory insurers.‘Headed for technofascism’: the rightwing roots of Silicon ValleyRead moreAI threatens to deepen these problems, obscuring discriminatory and profit-driven policies behind a sheen of computational neutrality. Emerging AI tools are ultimately controlled by the billionaires and corporations who own them, set their incentives, and determine their uses. And as has become increasingly apparent in Trump’s second term, many of these AI scions – Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and others – are open eugenicists guided by prejudice against gender and racial minorities and disabled people. What is emerging is a form of technofascism, as this administration helps a small cadre of allied tech magnates consolidate control over the nation’s data – and with it, the power to surveil and discipline entire populations.AI tools are perfectly suited to their project ofauthoritarian surveillance, which theTrump administrationis actively advancing through its “AI action plan”. By stripping away regulatory guardrails and granting tech firms free rein so long as they align with the administration’s ideology, the plan hands unprecedented power to corporations already steeped in eugenicist thinking. Beneath the rhetoric of innovation lies a simple, sobering fact: AI can only function by vacuuming up enormous troves of human data – data about our bodies, pain, behaviors, moods, anxieties, phobias, diets, substance use, sleep patterns, relationships, work routines, sexual practices, traumatic experiences, childhood memories, disabilities and life expectancy. This means that each step toward AI-driven medicine is also a step toward deeper, more opaque forms of data capture, surveillance and social control.Already, health insurance companies have usedAI-driven “predictive analytics”to flag patients as too costly, quietly downgrading their care or denying coverage outright. UnitedHealthrejected rehabilitation claimsfor elderly patients deemed unlikely to recover quickly enough, while Cigna used automated review systemsto deny thousands of claimsin seconds, with no physician ever even reading them.The result of all this efficiency is not more presence in caregiving, but lessAnother key assumption behind AI optimism is that it will free physicians to devote more time and attention to patients. Over the last several decades, countless technological advances in medicine – from electronic health records to billing automation – have been sold as a way to lighten the clinician’s load. Indeed,controlled trialsin which AI scribes wrote patient notes for doctors resulted in time savings and improved satisfaction with their workdays – but only in controlled experiments in which time savings are not accompanied by increased productivity expectations.The real world of the US healthcare system doesn’t generally work that way. Each technological advancement that could free up physician time has instead tightened the productivity ratchet: these “efficiency gains” have simply been used to squeeze more visits, more billing, and more profit out of every hour. In other words, whatever time and energy technology saves, the system immediately recaptures them to maximize profit. With private equity gobbling up healthcare facilities at an alarming rate, there is little reason to think the medical industry’s uses of AI will be different.The result of all this efficiency is not more presence in caregiving, but less. Already, patients’ most common complaint is that their doctors do not listen to them. They describe being treated as bundles of symptoms and lab values rather than as whole people. Good clinicians know what matters most in interactions with patients are the hesitations, silences and nervous laughs – the things left unsaid. These cannot be reduced to data points. They require presence, patience and attunement to the affective states, social relationships, family dynamics and fears of each patient. This is obviously true in the case of mental healthcare, but it is no less true in internal medicine, oncology or surgery, where patients are appealing for care in what are often the most vulnerable moments of their lives – moments in which a physician responds not just as a technician but as a person.AI, by contrast, is built to erase silence and isolate the patient as a calculable organism. It cannot recognize that a patient’s first version of their story is often not their real one – not the one that is troubling them most. Moreover,studiesof doctors’ reliance on AI underline that it frequently causes rapidclinical deskilling: when algorithms propose diagnoses or management plans, physicians’ reasoning skills atrophy, leaving them more dependent on machines and less capable of independent judgment. Rather than correcting human fallibility, AI seems more likely to amplify it by training clinicians out of their capacity to listen and think critically, collaboratively and creatively.View image in fullscreenReclaiming careIf the danger of AI medicine is forgetting what genuine care entails, then we must collectively recall the foundation of caregiving that has been obscured under US health capitalism. Care is not about diagnoses or prescriptions. It relies on something more fundamental: the provision of support to the other alongside the cultivation of an inner experience of concern toward others.This kind of care is inseparable from politics and the possibility of community. As philosophers from Socrates to Søren Kierkegaard and feminist theorists like Carol Gilligan and Joan Tronto have long argued, care is not only a clinical task butan ethical and political practice. It is, in the deepest sense, a practice of disalienation – of recovering our sense of ourselves as singular beings in community with one another in which individual difference is valued rather than erased.That is why care has transformative power beyond health. To be truly listened to – to be recognized not as a case but as a person – can change not just how one experiences illness, but how one experiences oneself and the world. It can foster the capacity to care for others across differences, to resist hatred and violence, to build the fragile social ties upon which democracy depends.By contrast, when medicine is reduced to data and transactions, it not only fails patients and demoralizes doctors. It also degrades democracy itself. A system that alienates people in their moments of deepest vulnerability – bankrupting them, gaslighting them, leaving them unheard – breeds despair and rage. It creates the conditions in which authoritarians gain traction.True care is not a transaction to be optimized; it is a practice and a relationship to be protectedIn this light, the rush to automate care is not politically neutral. To hollow out medicine’s capacity for presence and recognition is to hollow out one of the last civic institutions through which people might feel themselves to matter to another human being – to suffocate the very basis of society itself.Perhaps the most dangerous assumption behind the rise of AI in medicine is that its current trajectory and private ownership structure is inevitable. When we refuse this narrative of inevitability, we can finally recognize thatthe real alternative to our present is political, not technological.It requires investing in the caregiving workforce, strengthening publicly owned systems for both medical and social care, expanding the welfare state to combat growing inequality, and creating conditions for clinicians to care for patients as people, not data.Maga’s era of ‘soft eugenics’: let the weak get sick, help the clever breedRead moreTechnology, including AI, need not be inherently dehumanizing or alienating. In a national health system oriented toward genuine care, AI in medicine could help track medication safety, identify the most vulnerable individuals for intensive social and financial support, prioritize remedying inequities, or support overburdened clinicians and support staff without monetizing their every move. But such uses depend on a political economy premised on care, not extraction and the endless commodification of human life – one that values human diversity, collective flourishing and supporting each individual’s unique life potential over data capture, standardization and profit.If AI in service of corporate imperatives becomes medicine’s guiding force, these dimensions will not merely be neglected. They will be actively erased, recoded as inefficiencies, written out of what counts as care.To resist AI optimism is often cast as anti-progress or naive luddism. But progress worth pursuing requires refusing the illusion that faster, cheaper and more standardized is the same as better. True care is not a transaction to be optimized; it is a practice and a relationship to be protected – the fragile work of listening, presence and trust. If we surrender care to algorithms, we will lose not only the art of medicine but also the human connection and solidarity we need to reclaim our lives from those who would reduce them to data and profit.Eric Reinhartis a political anthropologist, psychiatrist and psychoanalystSpot illustrations by Georgette Smith"

Insiders say it ‘feels like a coup’ by broadcaster’s enemiesBBC bias row: how a week of hostile headlines from rightwing media led to resignationsMichael SavageMedia editorSun 9 Nov 2025 14.35 ESTFirst published on Sun 9 Nov 2025 13.07 ESTShareTim Davie, the BBC’s director general, and the head of BBC News have resigned after a former adviser to the corporation accused it of “serious and systemic” bias in its coverage of issues including Donald Trump, Gaza and trans rights.In an announcement that caused shock within the corporation, Davie said his departure was “entirely my decision” and it comes as the BBCprepares to apologisefor the way it edited a Trump speech.Deborah Turness, the head ofBBCNews, has also resigned. Sources within that department described a mood of dismay at Turness’s exit. “It feels like a coup,” one said. “This is the result of a campaign by political enemies of the BBC.”It is a huge moment for the corporation, as it heads into critical talks with the government over its future and funding. The hunt is now on to fill two of the biggest roles in British media.The BBC is facing a coordinated, politically motivated attack. With these resignations, it’s given in | Jane MartinsonRead moreThe Commons culture, media and sport select committee had set a Monday deadline for the BBC to respond to the claims made by Michael Prescott, a former independent external adviser to its editorial guidelines and standards committee. He left that role in the summer.Prescott criticised the editing of Trump’s speech in an edition of Panorama, which spliced together clips from an address the US president made on 6 January 2021. The edit suggested Trump told the crowd: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you, and we fight. We fight like hell.”The words were taken from sections of his speech almost an hour apart. The incident has led tocriticism of the BBC by Karoline Leavitt, Trump’s press secretary, who described the corporation this weekend as “100% fake news” and a “propaganda machine”.Last night, Leavitt appeared to celebrate the departures, referring on X to her complaints about the BBC’s treatment of the US president’s speech.Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that “very dishonest people” had “tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election”, adding: “On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for democracy!”Tim Davie: the marketing man who became the BBC’s director generalRead moreIn a note to staff, Davie said he had retained the “unswerving and unanimous support” of the BBC’s board and its chair, Samir Shah, throughout. However, he said the current accusations had contributed to his decision.“Like all public organisations, the BBC is not perfect, and we must always be open, transparent and accountable,” he said.“While not being the only reason, the current debate around BBC News has understandably contributed to my decision. Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director general I have to take ultimate responsibility.”Davie’s departure comes after a torrid year in which the BBC has been criticised over the comments of its former presenter Gary Lineker, the livestreaming of a Glastonbury festival performance of the rap punk duo Bob Vylan, and criticisms over a Gaza documentary.The departures of Davie and Turness appear to be an attempt to protect the BBC from further attacks following Prescott’s criticisms, which he made in a letter to the BBC’s board.View image in fullscreenDeborah Turness said: ‘In public life leaders need to be fully accountable, and that is why I am stepping down.’Photograph: Richard Kendal/RTS/PAShah said Davie’s departure was a “sad day” for the BBC. “He has had the full support of me and the board throughout,” he said. “However, I understand the continued pressure on him, personally and professionally, which has led him to take this decision today. The whole board respects the decision and the reasons for it.”The Prescott letter, which was passed to the Daily Telegraph, also condemned BBC Arabic for using contributors who had expressed antisemitic views. It included the views of a contributor who had previously stated online that Jews should be burned “as Hitler did”. The BBC has previously said he should not have been featured in the way he was.Another featured contributor had described Jews online as “devils”. The BBC said in May that the person had been barred from being a contributor in future.The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, had said she was confident that Shah and Davie were “treating this with the seriousness that this demands”.In her departure note to staff, Turness said: “The ongoing controversy around the Panorama on President Trump has reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC – an institution that I love.“As the CEO of BBC News and current affairs, the buck stops with me. In public life leaders need to be fully accountable, and that is why I am stepping down.”However, she used her departure statement to push back on Prescott’s allegations of general bias at the corporation. “While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong,” she said.The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said the corporation needs “to turn a new leaf”, the Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, called for “top-to-bottom” reform and Reform UK’s leader, Nigel Farage, said it was the BBC’s “last chance”.While many BBC figures believe Prescott’s letter refers to some genuine errors, there is also concern it is being used by its political opponents.Some BBC figures point to an effort to shift the corporation politically,dating back to Boris Johnson’s time in government. The Guardian has been told Prescott’s appointment as an external adviser had been pushed by the BBC board member Robbie Gibb, Theresa May’s former communications chief who helped set up the rightwing broadcaster GB News.Gibb was first placed on the BBC board during Johnson’s time in government. Gibb and Prescott have previously been reported as being friends. Gibb was on a four-person interview panel that appointed Prescott.Johnson told the Guardian that any suggestion of an attempt to undermine the BBC was “complete and utter bollocks”. Prescott said in his letter that his criticisms “do not come with any political agenda”.Explore more on these topicsTim DavieBBCnewsShareReuse this content"

During the conversation the lights went out twice.Ukraine facing widespread power cuts after generating capacity reduced to ‘zero’ by Russian attacksRead moreThe Ukrainian president denied claims Trump had tossed maps of the battlefield aside in a stormy exchange in October at the White House, where he had arrived hoping to secure supplies of US Tomahawk cruise missiles. “He didn’t throw anything. I am sure,” Zelenskyy said. He described their relations as “normal”, “businesslike” and “constructive”.According to theFinancial Times, Trump hadreportedly pressed Zelenskyyto accept Vladimir Putin’s maximalist terms for ending the war and said the Russian leader would “destroy” Ukraine if it did not agree. Zelenskyy said the meeting unfolded differently.The visiting Ukrainian delegation set up three stands in front of Trump and his US team, laying out successive measures including weapons and economic sanctions that would “weaken” Moscow, he said. The goal was to reduce Russia’s ability to bomb Ukraine and to force Putin to the negotiating table.Speaking at his presidential palace in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said “everyone in the world” was afraid of Trump. “That’s the truth,” he added. Asked if that applied to him as well, he said: “No … we are not enemies with America. We are friends. So why should we be afraid?”View image in fullscreenUkrainian soldiers receive awards to mark national paratroopers’ day at the presidential palace.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianHe said: “Trump was elected by his people. We have to respect the choice made by the American people, just as I am elected by my people. The US is our strategic partner, for many years, perhaps even decades and centuries.” The two countries had deep shared values, in contrast with an “imperialist” and revisionist Russia, he suggested.He also revealed King Charles had played a crucial behind-the-scenes role in encouraging the US president to support Ukraine more enthusiastically, following a tempestuous Oval Office meeting on camera in February whenTrump publicly browbeat Zelenskyyand kicked him out of the White House.During astate visit to the UK in SeptemberTrump held a one-on-one meeting with the king. “I don’t know all the details but I understand His Majesty sent some important signals to President Trump,” Zelenskyy said.He said Trump respected the king and considered him to be “very important”, a genuine compliment not extended – he thought – to very “many people”. “His Majesty is very sensitive to our people. Maybe sensitive is not the right word. He’s very supportive,” Ukraine’s president said.A few seconds after Zelenskyy sat down to talk to the Guardian, the interview was plunged into darkness when the electricity supply failed inside theMariinskyi Palacein the heart of the Ukrainian capital.In recent weeks Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine’s national power grid, leading to frequent blackouts in many towns and cities. Further attacks over the weekend havereduced the country’s energy generating capacity to “zero”, the state power firm Centrenergo said. Russian drones also hit two nuclear power stations deep in western Ukraine, and Kyiv has called on the UN’s nuclear watchdog to respond.However, after a palace backup generator came on the lights flickered into action.“These are our living conditions,” Zelenskyy said with a wry grin. “It’s normal. We have fluctuations with electricity in Kyiv, like everywhere else.” He said Putin was ordering “terrorist attacks” on Ukraine’s energy system, killing civilians and leaving them without power and water. “He can’t create tension within our society in any other way.”View image in fullscreenA dark street and residential buildings during a power blackout in Kyiv on Saturday.Photograph: Maxym Marusenko/NurPhoto/ShutterstockZelenskyy said he was working closely with international partners to protect Ukraine from nightly Russian drone swarms. So far, though, the UK and other allies have ruled out sending fighter jets to patrol the skies above the centre and west of the country – a longstanding Kyiv request. Zelenskyy said he wanted to order 27 Patriot air defence systems from US manufacturers. In the meantime, European states could lend Ukraine their existing Patriots, he said.Asked if the EU and UK were doing enough, ahead of a freezing and dark winter, Zelenskyy replied: “It’s never enough. It’s enough when the war ends. And enough when Putin understands that he has to stop.” He said he enjoyed warm relations withKeir Starmerand had “constant contacts” with London. “It’s not about him [the prime minister] personally,” he said, on the issue of insufficient aid.With Trump ruling out US military involvement, the French and UK governments have promised to send troops as part of an eventual peace settlement. Asked if he would like British soldiers to arrive sooner – to take up a defensive position on Ukraine’s border with Belarus, for example – Zelenskyy said: “Of course. We’ve been asking for many things including weapons and membership of the EU and Nato.”But he said the question of a European armed presence in Ukraine while fighting rages had to be handled carefully. “Leaders are afraid of their societies. They don’t want to be involved in the war,” he said. It was ultimately “their choice” over whether to deploy troops. If he pushed too hard, there was a risk Kyiv could lose “financial and military support from our partners”.In recent days Russian troops havecaptured most of the eastern city of Pokrovsk, after a long and bloody campaign. Zelenskyy said Moscow had thrown enormous forces into its operation – “170,000 men” – with the war at its fiercest and most brutal in Donetsk province, Putin’s main objective. “That’s the whole story. There is no [Russian] success there. And many casualties,” he said.According to Zelenskyy, Moscow suffered 25,000 soldiers killed and wounded in October – a record.He said the Kremlin was also waging a “hybrid war against Europe” and testing Nato’s red lines.He argued it was entirely possible Russia would open a second front against another European country before the Ukraine war ended: “I believe so. He can do that. We must forget about the general European scepticism that Putin first wants to occupy Ukraine and then may go somewhere else. He can do both at the same time.”View image in fullscreenZelenskyy during his interview with the Guardian. ‘I want to live in a world where I am simply respected. Not intimidated, not killed. I want to live in such a world.’Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianUkraine’s president linked the increase in malign activity across Europe – includinga decoy drone incursion over Poland, and the later appearance of drones over airports inCopenhagen,MunichandBrussels– to Russia’s failure to progress significantly on the frontline since the initial months after the 2022 full-scale invasion. “Putin is in a dead-end situation in terms of real success. It’s more like a stalemate for him. That’s why these failures could lead him to look for other territories. It’s very difficult for us but we are at home and defending ourselves,” he said.He described Russia as a large and aggressive country that needed a big external adversary to unite its different ethnic groups and regions. Putin saw the US and the west as the enemy, he said. “Befriending Russia is not a solution for America. In terms of values, Ukraine is much closer to the US than Russia.”Commentators have claimed that Russia’s land-grab in Ukraine – and Trump’s threat earlier this year to acquire Greenland “one way or another” – means the post-1945 rules-based order is effectively over. Asked if he agreed, Zelenskyy said: “No one should impose anything on you from outside. I want to live in a world where I am simply respected. Not intimidated, not killed. I want to live in such a world.”Zelenskyy has been Ukraine’s president since 2019 and has been leading his nation for almost four years of gruelling all-out war. How was he bearing up? “Well, I just love Ukraine. I can’t really find any reasons for it, you know. I think that people are held together by something greater than just logic. I love our people very much. It’s hard right now in Ukraine because of the war. But I want to be here.”Just before his interview with the Guardian, Zelenskyy gave out awards in a ceremonial hall to a small group of Ukrainian soldiers, to mark national paratroopers’ day. They collected their medals one by one, briskly saluting the president, who is Ukraine’s commander-in-chief. Several were made heroes of Ukraine, the state’s highest honour.Zelenskyy checked with his aides that his visitors had departed the palace building. They had. “Now we’ve finished we will reduce some electricity consumption here. We need to save it,” he said.Explore more on these topicsVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkraineRussiaDonald TrumpForeign policyUS foreign policyVladimir PutininterviewsShareReuse this content"

Yet fragile and conflict-affected countries hosting refugees receive only a quarter of the climate finance they need.Refugees and displaced people, often living in precarious physical and political conditions, are among the hardest hit by the climate crisis despite contributing little to its causes.In May 2024, catastrophic flooding in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul killed 181 people, causing billions of dollars of damage. The floods displaced 580,000 people, including 43,000 vulnerable refugees from Venezuela, Haiti and Cuba, who were living in some of the most flood-affected areas in the region, according to UNHCR.A year earlier, Cyclone Mocha – the most destructive storm to hit Myanmar in years – made landfall in Rakhine state where 160,000 ethnic Rohingya have been living in overcrowded camps since 2012.“We had very little to begin with,” Ma Phyu Ma, 37, an internally displaced Rohingya told UN researchers. “The hut was our shelter. The boat and nets allowed us to fish. The clothes were my source of income. It is painful for me to lose everything.”In 2024, a third of all emergencies declared by UNHCR involved floods, drought, wildfires and other extreme weather events affecting people displaced by war.Three-quarters of refugees and other displaced people now live in countries facing high or extreme exposure to climate-related hazards, with repeated displacement becoming increasingly common.Chad, one of the most politically fragile and climate-vulnerable countries, hosts more than 1.4 million refugees and asylum seekers. In 2024 alone, floods forced more than 1.3 million people to flee their homes and camps – more than the previous 15 years combined. Refugees from war-torn Sudan receive less than 10 litres of water a day – far below emergency standards.Almost half the world’s displaced people are facing conflict and climate impacts in politically fragile states, including Sudan, Syria, Haiti, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lebanon, Myanmar and Yemen. These countries contribute negligibly to global greenhouse gas emissions yet have limited access to climate finance and solutions needed to adapt.Without radical action to curtail climate catastrophe and help poor countries adapt, the situation is likely to get much worse, the report warns.By 2050, the hottest refugee camps could face nearly 200 days of dangerous heat stress per year, with serious risks to health and survival, with many locations becoming uninhabitable.The UNHRC is calling on climate negotiators atCop30in Brazil to pay attention to this largely ignored and rapidly growing population.Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees, said: “Funding cuts are severely limiting our ability to protect refugees and displaced families from the effects of extreme weather. If we want stability, we must invest where people are most at risk. To prevent further displacement, climate financing needs to reach the communities already living on the edge.“They cannot be left alone. This Cop must deliver real action, not empty promises.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisCop30RefugeesnewsShareReuse this content"

The flip between the dream of driving for this amazing team and then the nightmare of the results that we’ve had. We are just really having to fight through those hardships at the moment.Lando Norris victorious after a thrilling São Paulo Grand Prix – as it happenedRead more“This weekend has been disastrous and disappointing for everyone. I am trying to keep my head above water and remain positive.”In a race won byLando Norristo extend his world championship lead to 24 points from his McLaren teammate, Oscar Piastri, Hamilton once more toiled to little effect. He had qualified in 13th and then early in the race was clipped by Carlos Sainz and shortly afterwards took floor damage when he misjudged an attempted pass on Franco Colapinto.He was forced to retire the car on lap 37, another poor result in a season in which he is sixth in the championship, 66 points behind his teammate, Charles Leclerc, and still without a podium finish.However, the seven-time champion remained resolute that he andFerrariwould find their feet as they focus on next season. “I believe there is something extraordinary up ahead in my life and in my destiny,” he said. “I truly still believe in this team and what we can achieve together. I just have to keep pushing and keep giving them everything I can.”Meanwhile, a punchy Norris has insisted he would ignore critics “talking crap” and attempting to bring him down as he focused only on himself in attempting to close out his first world championship, after victory in Brazil.Norris won at Interlagos with a superb drive from pole position but immediately after the race hit out at questions that had been raised previously regarding his ability to fight for a title. “Just ignore everyone that talks crap about you and focus on yourself,” he said of his approach since he came from behind to retake the lead in the title race.He was the subject of booing at the last round in Mexico and went on to emphasise that he felt he had to cut out the noise that now surrounds the title fight with three races remaining.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Most of the previous exhibitions have been about the ‘boys’ toys’, as I call them sometimes, somewhat facetiously – the weapons.“There have also been exhibitions, particularly inJapan, about the arts of the samurai. But this is trying to say that there’s a lot that is misunderstood and based on myth.”Recalling that the British Museum previously staged two exhibitions on samurai swords, she said: “Swords are important, but they are by no means the whole story. So this is going to be much bigger than has ever been attempted before …“What I want to address in the exhibition is the way that perception of the samurai has become narrowed down to just this male warrior in armour wielding a sword.“That’s a tiny part of what they were over hundreds of years. They were warriors in the beginning, but there was a balance between the military and the literary and the artistic. So that’s a huge part of the story.”She added: “This rediscovery of female samurai history reframes centuries of gendered myth and challenges the hyper-masculine image of the samurai that still dominates film, anime and gaming.”The samurai emerged in the 900s as mercenaries for the imperial court. They were formidable and fearsome warriors during the middle ages.They gained political dominance from the 1100s and, during a long era of peace from 1615, they became government officials, scholars and patrons of the arts. By the late 19th century, their hereditary status had been abolished as Japan modernised itself.The exhibition will feature more than 280 objects, many of which have never been seen in the UK before. It will also draw on the British Museum’s own collection – one of the largest outside Japan – whose objects are too delicate to be displayed permanently.View image in fullscreenWoman’s firefighting jacket and hood.Photograph: John C. Weber Collection/John Bigelow TaylorAs well as arms and armour, there will be paintings, woodblock prints, books, clothing and ceramics.“Because the samurai were elite, the best quality objects were made for them,” Buckland said. “Different types of clothing for samurai men and women differentiated them from the other classes in society. Most importantly, the men were allowed to wear two swords.”Exhibits to be seen for the first time include a spectacular suit of armour recently acquired by the British Museum. Its helmet and golden standard, shaped like iris leaves and coated in gold leaf, made the wearer both identifiable and fearsome.Buckland said that such suits were recycled over the centuries, reusing the robust sections from those inherited from previous generations and remaking more delicate ones such as silk sleeves, among other elements. Even away from the battlefield, a suit of armour was a status symbol.In one such exhibit, the oldest part dates from 1519, while other details were made in the early 19th century.View image in fullscreenBamboo folding fan, Watanabe Kazan.Photograph: Trustees of the British MuseumThe exhibition will reflect that the samurai enjoyed centuries of peace, with plenty of time to pursue artistic and intellectual interests. The paintings range from a cute cat depicted by a samurai lord’s wife to botanical studies.There is also a firefighting jacket that women wore while serving within Edo Castle. Fires were so common in the wooden city of Edo – present-day Tokyo – that the fires were known as the “flowers of Edo”, and this jacket’s watery motifs of tasselled anchors and waves evoke protection against the flames. High-ranking samurai were responsible for raising the alarm, supervising firefighting and evacuations.The word “samurai” is used increasingly in Japan but only because it is used by foreigners, Buckland said: “It’s difficult to unearth when it started to be used by foreigners. That was a long time ago.“But there are other words in Japanese that mean warrior or member of the military class. Literally, samurai means something like ‘subordinate’. It’s actually got quite a pejorative sense, which is why it was never previously used in Japanese.“In the early times, the word for warrior was ‘musha’ and, in the later times when the samurai were in charge of everything, they were called ‘bushi’.”Buckland observed the Japanese have imported some of the western perceptions “because it’s useful for the tourist industry”.She added: “I went to a hotel last year and was greeted by three virtual check-in receptionists, Godzilla, a geisha – and a samurai warrior.”Samuraiis at the British Museumfrom 3 Februaryto 4 May2026.

That all changed on Sunday, when Tim Davie and Deborah Turnessboth quittheir jobs.Davie oversaw no shortage of scandals during his five years as director general – in recent months these included rows over aGaza documentaryandGlastonburycoverage – and was nicknamed “Teflon Tim” by BBC insiders because nothing seemed to stick.But this week, it did.Odd, though, that the trigger for this crisis was a largely forgotten report by the Panorama programme, broadcast more than a year ago, about the US election.The BBC is facing a coordinated, politically motivated attack. With these resignations, it has given in | Jane MartinsonRead moreThe Daily Telegraph, never a friend to theBBC, was leaked a report by Michael Prescott, a former adviser to the BBC committee overseeing editorial standards.Prescott’s report suggested Panoramaedited a Donald Trump speechso it looked as if he had explicitly encouraged the Capitol riots.Prescott accused the corporation of “serious and systemic” bias in its editorial coverage. Perhaps predictably, parts of the right immediately leapt on the report.Boris Johnson told the Telegraph that Davie “must either explain or resign”. The Tory party leader, Kemi Badenoch, said “heads should roll”. The story was picked up in the US, where the White House described the BBC as “100% fake news” and a “propaganda machine”.Senior BBC insiders were dismayed.Aware of the crucial role the corporation plays in national life, they have admitted to genuine concern about the proclivity for big editorial errors. But they have also had deeper fears: that the attacks are part of an ongoing political and ideological campaign by those who want to undermine the organisation.Yet the government has had concerns of its own over the BBC.Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, said on Sunday – before the resignations – that she had “countless conversations with the senior leadership, too many to name, and far more than I would like” since the election. There appeared to be have been little trust between her and Davie.‘I have to take ultimate responsibility’: Tim Davie’s BBC resignation statementRead moreNandywarned that there was “a very, very dangerous environment in this country where people can’t trust what they see”. BBC News – with its huge reach at home and abroad – plays a key role in challenging disinformation in the increasingly polarised media landscape.It is because of this that Nandy is understood to privately share the concerns of many BBC staff that some of the attacks on the corporation are politically orchestrated – and that there has been a dearth of figures at the top of the organisation who can successfully navigate culture wars.Many inside government – and across the progressive parties – share the view that, for all its faults, the public service broadcaster’s role in preserving democracy, which is under threat from the rise of the populist right, is vital.“The BBC isn’t perfect, but it remains one of the few institutions standing between our British values and a populist, Trump-style takeover of our politics,” the Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, said on Sunday.Yet whatever politicians think of the BBC, its fate lies with the public, and whether the British people have confidence in its future. Ultimately, that depends on fair and accurate reporting, free from political or ideological bias – from either side.The BBC regularly comes out top in UK media trust rankings. Yet the latest row comes at a particularly sensitive time, with the government due to review its royal charter before the current term expires in 2027.Senior government insiders hope to use the charter review process to “future proof” the BBC by putting in place structures that protect its independence – but also to make sure the corporation is more accountable.It will have to be for the BBC to repair the broken trust with politicians, with some of its own journalists and – crucially – with parts of the public.Explore more on these topicsBBCTim DavieLisa NandyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Eating out here is rarer, as strict kosher rules mean families have fewer options, and what’s eaten at home is often imported.This means more nappies, more plastics and more demand for bins in a city where domestic waste – excluding food, garden waste and paper recycling – is typically collected only once every three weeks.View image in fullscreenFull domestic bins in Broughton Park, where families tend to be larger.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianBut when a local councillor proposed a radical solution to the area’s bin problems, it sparked death threats, a backlash from rabbis across the country and antisemitic rumours of “a Jewish council taking over”.Earlier this year, Andrew Walters, the rapporteur for waste inSalford, proposed a breakaway town council for Broughton Park that he hoped would give local people more control over bins and public spending. On 19 November, councillors in Salford – a city of nearly 300,000 people – are expected to vote on the “Town of Broughton Park” plan, nicknamed BrePxit (Broughton Park exit).However, in a statement this week, Salford’s city mayor, Paul Dennett, said he feared the proposal posed a risk to community relations and safety, after last month’s attack on a Manchester synagogue a mile away from Broughton Park.Dennett spoke out after 47 British rabbis urged him to “veto” the proposal.Letters obtained by the Manchester Evening Newsrevealed some Jewish community religious leaders feared the proposed new council, which would cover an area of 10,000 voters over two neighbouring wards – Kersal and Broughton Park, and Broughton – would be seen as an “ethnic” political enclave, jeopardising Salford’s amicable community relations and generating “strife, violence and hate crimes”.The councilheld a consultationon the parish council plan after a community governance review was triggered by a petitionsigned by at least 7.5% of the residents affected– about 1,000 residents. A source said Salford council had received its largest ever response to a public consultation on the plan, including expressions of support, antisemitic messages and fears of division.Salford’s Jewish population doubled to 10,373 between 2001 and the last census in 2021, driven by high Haredi birthrates and large, young families moving to the area,according to the Institute for Jewish Policy Research.Walters, an independent councillor for Kersal and Broughton Park, said his “hyper-localisation” governance proposal was never intended to be “ethnocentric” in an area that also has significant white, black and Asian populations. He said he was concerned a “one-size-fits-all” approach to services wasn’t meeting local, idiosyncratic needs in an area where he believed there was more demand for play spaces and bins than adult social care.“Waste collection is the same whether it’s a single-person household or a family of 12 – people cannot manage,” he added.However, misunderstanding about the motive and uncertainty about the plan’s cost had spread in the current anti-immigration climate, he said.“I’ve personally had death threats, which are subject to an ongoing police investigation,” he said. “Some of the non-Jewish populace felt that this was going to be a Jewish council taking over [and] some members of the Jewish community felt that it would cause community tensions.“This is a democratic process recognised under statute. It’s not a religious council by any sense. Anyone can stand as a councillor unless otherwise disqualified. But there’s that fear factor, exacerbated due to the recent terror attacks, that we need, as Orthodox Jews, to keep a low profile. And this was wrongly seen by some as an ethnocentric thing, which it completely is not.”On 2 October, Adrian Daulby, 53 and Melvin Cravitz, 66, were killed after Jihad Al-Shamieattacked Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue.In a recent letter to Dennett, rabbis wrote: “Even at the best of times, the instigation and creation of a parish council by an ethnic minority is for obvious reasons not to be encouraged. What would Great Britain look like were the map to be dotted with numerous enclaves of parish councils created and governed by diverse ethnic, religious or political groups?”In a statement, Dennett said: “Following the receipt of the letter of concern from 47 rabbis across the country, I want to make it clear that I share their concerns regarding community cohesion and safety – particularly in light of the horrific [synagogue] attack.”Walters, a member of the interfaith Muslim Jewish Forum of Greater Manchester, said the process had shown an appetite for local democracy, while highlighting the need for community cohesion.He added: “I deal with Jewish and non-Jewish constituents and do my best to help everyone equally.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

She and the drama’s creators discuss the challenges of staging masturbation, and getting audiences to relate to its troubled leadSun 9 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTShareIn Sophia Chetin-Leuner’s Porn Play, which has just opened at London’s Royal Court, Ani is a 30-year-old academic at the frontier of intellectual discovery: she’s winning awards for her radical revision of John Milton’s Paradise Lost, effortlessly earning the admiration of her mentor and her students alike. She’s also addicted to violent pornography and is masturbating constantly. She can’t stay in a real-life sexual moment, but she can’t stay in a real-life conversation, either – constantly reaching for her phone, watching porn and wanking, often in situations just about believable yet so outlandishly wrong that reading the play, and observing Ani’s career and relationships unravel, is like being trapped in someone’s anxiety dream.So it’s quite a bold choice of role for the person playing Ani,Ambika Mod. Since starring in This Is Going to Hurt in 2022, but even more so since One Day last year, she has become known, in her words, “for playing very noble characters who die”. Mod has the world of romantic leads at her feet – a beautiful, relatable everywoman, who could tell you the truth of the human heart with one raised eyebrow. Starring in a play whose opening scene has her on all fours atop a mirror, in a frenzy of narcissistic delight, whose every action is centred on her body … well, it feels like it must have been a decision to wrestle with?“This is going to make me sound really crazy,” Mod says, “but actually no. My initial thoughts when I read the script were: ‘What a fucking great play, what a fucking great character, what an interesting thing that I’ve never seen before.’”View image in fullscreenClose reading … Ambika Mod and Will Close in rehearsals for Porn Play.Photograph: Helen MurrayChetin-Leuner started writing Porn Play eight years ago, while she was on a scholarship at Tisch School of the Arts at NYU. She has a sweet, soft voice and demeanour, which seem almost comical when all you know of her is her play’s caustic dialogue. She says she wanted to write about porn, broadly, because “the internet has just ruined what, in essence, could be a really gorgeous exploration of different kinks. When you’re 12, which is the age that children start looking at pornography online now, the way algorithms work is they might start with one thing, but then it pushes more and more violence. By the time people are becoming sexually active, they’ve absorbed so much that it’s shaped their idea of intimacy, their sexual preferences, everything.”Some of the details in the play that might sound madly embellished – Ani has to go to the GP because she’s masturbated so much that she’s done herself a mischief – are actually drawn from real-life porn addicts Chetin-Leuner interviewed while she was in the US. Plenty has been written about this addiction, but almost all of it through a male lens, while in her research she found that women were much more likely than men to watch violent pornography (though it’s low single digits for either gender to search for non-consensual violence,according to the most often-cited study).But how on earth do you stage a play like this? Masturbation is such a private thing. Across the whole spectrum of possible ways you could portray it – from grotesque to erotic – there is something about turning that privacy inside out that is so confrontational as to amount to a kind of violence.Josie Rourke, the play’s director, is one of those people who you take one look at and think, “OK, she’s got this”, given her previous work as artistic director at London’s Donmar Warehouse theatre and, before that, the Bush. “One of the nice things about having been a theatre director for a couple of decades is that it’s possible for me to look at a scene very practically, thinking about how it’s going to be delivered,” she says. “Your brain is thinking: ‘How do we do that?’ using exactly the same technical bits that you’d use for, ‘How are we going to kill Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet?’”This isn’t Rourke’s first rodeo, which she illustrates with even less stageable moments in her career than 24/7 masturbation. In her 20s she directed Loyal Women, a play about the women’s wing of the Ulster Defence Association, in which someone had to be tarred and feathered. “There’s always another question, beyond ‘How do you get it to deliver?’, which is: ‘How do you make it eloquent?’” she says. “Although what occurs in the play is extremely graphic, how do we have the audience feellikethe character, and not like they’re observing the character?”From Mod’s perspective, the challenge is part of the point. “Especially as a brown woman, you feel the push towards meekness, towards sexlessness, towards being a good girl. A personal desire of mine is that I want more mess in the characters I play, in the stories I tell.”It’s still on my mind that audiences might revolt. Ten years ago, I covered the scandal at the Royal Opera House, when there was nudity and a rape scene in Guillaume Tell, and the audience booed, people walked out. Rourke is unperturbed about this prospect, partly because the Royal Court is well known for pushing at boundaries, whether those are of decency, taste or simply the frame of what does and does not belong on stage. “Some people walked out of Look Back in Anger,” Rourke says (if you’ve forgotten the fine details, audience members audibly gasped at the sight of an ironing board on stage).“It’s not about sensationalism, it’s about this being a theatre you come to to understand what is occurring in the world, that may reach beyond our own experience. Tough stuff happens here.”And truly, Porn Play is about more than the impact of porn: how it flattens, homogenises, abstracts and finally disembodies sex, as it removes you from the world and the people in it. That is a backdrop, really, to other, searching questions in the play: about shame and grief; kink and authenticity; God and the patriarchy; Milton; Adam and Eve; addiction and relationships; how different generations bounce off each other.A lot of research on addiction, isn’t it always a search for love, for connection and intimacy?Ambika ModIndeed, part of Ani’s unravelling as an academic actually isn’t because she’s watching porn all day; it’s because she hits the hard edge of one of her gen Z student’s boundaries by describing rape as “sexy”. Arguing thatshewasn’t calling it sexy, she was considering whether Milton was, does nothing to soften the exchange. It’s a perfect distillation of the condition of millennial womanhood; the first generation to have porn omnipresent through their sexual awakening, they’re policed by the conservatism of their elders, which still sees sexual destiny as a guy thing, while at the same time, the generation beneath them is more militant about consent, abuse, trauma and trigger warnings. The space in which millennial women can discuss desire is vanishingly small, and full of landmines.“We are not given the grace of nuance and complexity in any of our discussions,” Mod says – born in 1995, she is, like Ani, almost too young to be a millennial, but just too old for gen Z, which technically started in 1997. “It feels so healthy to sit in the swirl of this play, because outside it, binaries are becoming stronger and stronger. In the same way that pornography is very harmful, social media is also fucking us up.”View image in fullscreenGlass action … Ambika Mod in rehearsals for Porn Play.Photograph: Helen MurrayBesides tearing up what you can and can’t say, Porn Play might also upend what you thought about Milton – classic patriarch, in art and in life, a man so violently domineering that his first wife left him because she couldn’t stand the sound of him beating his students over Latin grammar. Ani argues that in his portrait of Eve, in Paradise Lost, her worship of the serpent is essentially penis worship – her self-love is indivisible from her sexuality, and the fall is worth it. So the poem doesn’t just allow for female desire, it frames it as elementally powerful. If you squint a bit, Porn Play recasts Milton as a feminist sexual adventurer and philosopher of kink.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She approaches this obliquely: “I was talking to a lot of recovering sex and porn addicts, and loads of it was about religion,” she says. “They’d either come from really religious backgrounds, or they’d found religion as part of their recovery. I didn’t want to do a play about that, but I understood there’s something about the ultimate patriarch, God …” she tails off, I’m guessing because the thought ends somewhere blasphemous from both a religious and feminist perspective. “Anyway, that’s where Milton came in: he has this great quality, where his poetry shifts beneath your feet. Is he a proto-feminist or a horrible arsehole? Probably both.”Mod was raised a Hindu but isn’t particularly religious now, though she is spiritual. “We decided for Ani that she would have that same background and heritage, but I wanted to be really clear that I didn’t want her specialism in academia to be in any way tied to her own faith,” she says. Rourke was raised Roman Catholic, and says this play has uncovered “a childhood and teens that were spent being told how to worship, how to think about my body. The church needed to sit in between me and those ideas, not just in between me and God.“I think a lot about original sin,” she continues. “Is there a thing we can’t get out of ourselves? That we’re continually trying to? It makes immediate sense to people who went through that doctrine, and no sense at all to people who didn’t: you are told that there is this sin that you carry around from birth. There’s something about that that I find so evocative and profound.”In the end, the porn addiction is just that, an addiction: some of the most powerful scenes are the tragic, ugly loneliness of the addict, and the hero’s journey is, Mod says, “trying to get Ani to interact with the real world. Trying to get her back to a place where she remembered that she was loved. I don’t want to sound really pedestrian, but a lot of research on addiction, isn’t it always a search for love, for connection and intimacy?”‘I spoke complete twaddle for four minutes’: Meera Syal, Larry Lamb and more on the terror of stage frightRead moreBut Ani’s arc is so much richer than an addict’s journey back into the world of healthy, responsible adults. Her basest instincts are interlaced throughout with her most truthful, her ugliest moments slide in and out of her noblest. Mod, Rourke and Chetin-Leuner never sound more similar than when they’re laughing about how many times they’ve been asked to make a female character more “likable”. “No one’s going, ‘Is Macbeth likable enough, though?’” Mod says. Chetin-Leuner “can’t believe people are still saying that about women in stories, but they are”. Rourke says that whenever she hears “likable” in a meeting, she says “heroic” at exactly the same time, “so that word sits above ‘likable’”.“A play is also a poetic space,” Rourke continues. “I don’t want anybody leaving Porn Play shocked and trembling; I want to open up the poetic space within their own sense of shame, their own sense of who they are. And for that, they have to have a heroic relationship to this character. She’s the hero of the play.”Porn Playis at the Royal Court theatre, London, to13 December.Explore more on these topicsAmbika ModTheatreJosie RourkeRoyal Court theatrePornographyJohn MiltoninterviewsShareReuse this content"

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told toNaomi Larsson PiñedaSun 9 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTShareClaudine, 60With John there’s never any pressure, unlike in my old relationshipAbout five years ago I came out of a relationship of more than 30 years and really didn’t expect to meet anybody else. I tried internet dating, but felt like a dinosaur. It was so confusing – people would just say “Hi” and then not contact you for a week.John kept popping up, and when we finally met, about two years ago, I thought, “Oh my God, he’s lovely. There was a real spark.”I couldn’t believe I really fancied him – and that everything worked. When you haven’t had sex for a long time you think nothing will work anymore. I thought I was old and dried up, and then I found out I wasn’t at all. The sex was instantly very good. I walk around with the most ridiculous smile on my face. The joy is unbelievable.John is someone with amazing stamina. You feel like you’re in your 20s. The only difference is you’re knackered the next dayIn the beginning, we were having sex every day. It was so nice, though now we live together real life gets in the way. But as long as we’ve got time, we have sex, so it’s not for a lack of desire. We’re probably down to about once a week now. The big difference with John is that there’s never any pressure, unlike in my old relationship. The more pressure there is, the more it puts you off sex.If we’re too tired to have sex at night, we’ll plan for a couple of hours in the middle of the day because we know that a quickie isn’t going to really do it for me, and John has amazing stamina. You feel like you’re in your 20s. The only difference is you’re knackered afterwards.I’m sure we’re super vanilla in what we do – we’re not kinky. It’s just healthy, great sex. The big thing is that because we’re older we need a lot of time. In the beginning, we would go to bed at 11, and then still be up at three in the morning.Being older, you know what you want and it’s not about just lust. It’s about a real, deeper connection.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

It changed my life overnight, from feeling quite alone to being really excited for life and meeting new people. I had quite a lot of dates, and the majority of those ended up with sex of some description.In all my relationships, sex has been very important. And with Claudine it’s really, really nice. She says I just have a very short memory, but each time is always the best. I suppose it’s because there seems to be an equal level of understanding, pleasure and communication.We only ever have slow sex. And for that we need at least an hour. Finding that time isn’t as easy as when we first startedWe only ever have slow sex. And for that we need at least an hour. Finding that time isn’t as easy as when we first met. Then we were probably having at least one and sometimes two sex sessions a day, and walking around half dead due to lack of sleep. Now we are living together – and have been for a year – the frequency has reduced. The way we end most days is going to bed together, sometimes completely naked, sometimes with underwear on. Ordinarily she will have her back to me, I think it’s called spooning. There’s a lovely closeness in that.One of the advantages of getting older is that I don’t come so quickly. When I was younger, I could never have spent this long in foreplay, being touched and caressed without coming. Instead of having maybe 15 minutes of pleasure – which it may have been in my previous relationships – it runs over an hour and it feels very exciting.In fact, many of our lovemaking sessions won’t actually involve penetrative sex. And that’s OK too, it’s about building up to a crescendo.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThis is how we do itSexRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It really hits a nerveJack SealeSun 9 Nov 2025 17.15 ESTShareWe could be happy together, if only we weren’t here and it wasn’t now: the tragedy of sweethearts caught up in conflict, their love overcome by others’ hate, is an old and powerful story. Trespasses, an adaptation of Louise Kennedy’s novel, written by Ailbhe Keogan, hits that nerve.A small town outside Belfast, 1975: rancour, suspicion and grief shadow every moment in the thwarted life of Cushla (Lola Petticrew), a Catholic primary-school teacher in her mid-20s who is giving up her spare time to work shifts in her brother’s pub. The priests at the school are hollering bigots, telling the children that every Protestant is an evil enemy, despite one of the kids being the son of a Catholic father and Protestant mother. Cushla takes an interest in the boy, who tends to arrive at school without a coat, and his elder brother, who shows signs of secretly sharing Cushla’s love of reading. She gives them lifts back to their house on a flag-strewn Protestant estate, at the risk of her car being pelted with bricks, and redoubles her support for the family when the dad has his legs and skull broken by vengeful neighbours.In the pub, meanwhile, the British soldiers who drink there make every evening a tense ordeal, fraught with the possibility of it ending in violence that Cushla and her brother would be powerless to stop. After closing, Cushla invariably arrives home to find her widowed mother Gina (Gillian Anderson) drowning in loneliness and gin.View image in fullscreenDrowning in loneliness and gin … Gillian Anderson as Gina Lavery in Trespasses.Photograph: Peter Marley/Channel 4We know that in six months’ time, Cushla will be picking through the pub’s smoking ashes, with who knows who having been caught in the blast, and we suspect that this is the end of a sequence of events set in train when controversial local celebrity Michael Agnew (Tom Cullen) walks in. Cushla visibly loves him from that moment, before he has sat down and suavely ordered his first Jameson. Michael is a Protestant barrister who defends young Catholics, in the belief that securing them a fair trial is the best way for him to personally slow Northern Ireland’s cycle of violence – a gesture that has made him unpopular with other Protestants, but also with Catholics, who feel he legitimises the repressive judicial system. He’s a walking target, he’s married and he’s at least a decade older than Cushla, probably more like two. Embarking on an all-enveloping affair with him would be wild.With the tousled hair and tight waistcoat of a romantic hero from two centuries prior, Cullen’s Michael is a dreamy old goat. His charisma is timeless. It’s not clear how seriously Cushla (and we) should take his grand “this is the point of the series, folks” speech about how “we must find the bravery to choose freedom over fear”, delivered on a gorsey hillock away from all the urban warfare, but the sentiment is intoxicating anyway.“It’s yourself,” he says as she stands in front of him alone for the first time, in his posh city shag-pad. Van Morrison spins tastefully on his turntable two minutes later as Cushla dangles her head off the edge of the mattress, with Michael’s head in the middle. In Cullen’s hands, the guy has game, and the show wouldn’t work if he didn’t. But the bigger burden is borne by Petticrew, who is in every scene and who, if she played Cushla with less care, could let the character’s ever-changing intentions and passionate purity tip into naivety. Instead she makes the tension between Cushla’s energy and cold reality at first rousing, then heartbreaking.As it establishes itself, Trespasses seems like a collection of familiar melodramas, each borrowing from the Troubles for extra dramatic heft. We have the woman in love with a married man who isn’t honest about his home life, the teacher who goes outside her remit to help a deprived pupil, and the woman whose alcoholic mother’s final descent to oblivion will surely coincide with the one time her daughter focuses on her own happiness. It’s all Cushla, with each relationship drawing on the visceral enmity between Catholics and Protestants to rescue it from cliche. But the narrative is constructed with deceptive skill. Small moments and minor characters turn out to be crucial and, as the strands knit together, agonising ironies pile up.Strip down the show’s politics and they would be dangerously close to a hand-wringing plea for both sides to stop being as bad as each other, to end the violence, and won’t somebody please think of the children. But the Troubles give Trespasses what it needs. As individuals’ hopes and feelings are crushed in the gears of events much bigger than them, we feel that pain.Trespasses is on Channel 4 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewGillian AndersonreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here, unfortunately, was the essence of the event’s absurdity: as if to confirm people’s most cynical views of politics, she served notice that she is about to do something hugely significant, but refused to explicitly say what it is.But thanks to nods, winks and the usual anonymous briefings, what she was signalling was obvious: she could no longer honour her party’s manifesto pledge not to raise national insurance, VAT or income tax – and that, in a gambitlast tried bya chancellor in 1975, the basic rate of the last is likely to go up.If that happens, it will be a massively dangerous moment. Whatever sweeteners are offered and however much ministers might point to additional measures that will hit higher earners, one of the few memorable promises made at the last election will have been broken. The move, moreover, will confirm something that I see and hear whenever I go out reporting: the fact that millions of people resent the feeling of paying more and more for less and less. The public’s already woeful levels of trust in traditional politics will probably reach a new low, with potentially seismic consequences – and not just for Reeves and her party.The essential pointwas madea few days before Reeves’s speech by Luke Tryl, the UK director of the thinktank and research organisation More In Common, and someone with an incisive understanding of where we have arrived. “I still don’t think enough people realise how much traditional mainstream politics is in the last chance saloon, in no small part because it can’t be trusted to deliver what it promises,” he said on X. “Already the combined Green/Reform vote is higher than [the] Tory/Labour vote – previously unthinkable.”We are, in other words, in the middle of a huge fragmentation-cum-realignment, which Reeves, Keir Starmer and their colleagues seem only to be accelerating. Reform UK’s lead in thepolls will soon be a year old. The Green party seems to have recently drawn level with Labour – and, in at leastone recent case, pulled slightly ahead. The Liberal Democrats are rarely far behind. The Tories, who got 43% of the vote in 2019, are now also in the mid-teens. Factor in Plaid Cymru’screditable ratingsin Wales and therevival of the SNPin Scotland, and the picture is complete (for now).The truth is that a trend of turbulence and insurgency has been gaining pace for years. If you wanted to take a very long view, you couldgo back to 1974, and two general elections when the old Liberal party got nearly 20% of the poll, there were Plaid breakthroughs and, in the second contest, the SNP won nearly a third of the vote in Scotland. But the clearest story goes back about a decade. In the wake of Ukip winning nearly 4m votes in the 2015 general election, the vote for Brexit told the same story even more spectacularly. In turn, that led on to the wild swings that turned so many Labour heartlands blue in 2019 , and the defining facts of last year’s election: advances for Reform, the Greens and the Lib Dems, and a Labour win secured with the support ofonly 20%– 20%! – of the total electorate.Why is all this happening? Clearly, the reasons run much deeper than the charisma and agility of Nigel Farage and the Greens’ new leader,Zack Polanski, and the comparatively leaden vibes of Starmer, Reeves and Kemi Badenoch. Though the country’s stagnating condition is massively relevant, the fundamental reasons also go beyond an economy and society that have sat basically unchanged since the financial crash of 2008, and the failures of the various administrations that have run the UK since.Fundamentally, politics is fast-changing and multifaceted mainly because modern human beings are – and in the absence of the kind of institutional guardrails that preserve the two-party system in the US, voters’ choices reflect their lives. People’s identities are complicated – something intensified by the means of communication we still clunkily call social media. There will, therefore, be no going back to a majoritarian politics in which most voters loyally choose one of two archaic teams. All that has gone. What hasn’t yet occurred to most politicians is that the same applies to people in suits spouting cliches about “hardworking families”, the daily (legacy) media round, “pitch-rolling” speeches and all of Westminster’s other outmoded rituals.In the face of that huge change, the Tories andLabourhave a lot in common. They carry on in the hope that 20th-century politics can somehow be revived, and behave as if something is terribly wrong when the old ways don’t work. On the current evidence, despite the fact that this is clearly no time for unforced errors, they have also responded to transformed realities with panic, and a governing style that tends to mix complacency with ineptitude.Labour has not, of course, got anywhere near the Liz Truss catastrophe – indeed, Reeves’s core principle is the avoidance of anything even remotely similar. But after less than 18 months in power, it is now indelibly the party thatgot in a terrible messover the winter fuel allowance, and then fell into theup-the-hill-then-down-againfarce of its proposed cuts to disability benefits. Amazingly, it still has no coherent narrative it can call on when it collides with completely predictable difficulties – such as the need to break a rash promise on tax that it was probably never going to be able to keep. We now learn that itslast electoral hopemay lie in people tactically voting en masse against Reform, and the belief that, as one insider put it last week, “even if they hate us, they hate Farage more”. That is pitiful, and a sign that Labour may simply not be able to cope with the 21st century.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That would be a waking nightmare, but there is one ray of hope. One of the key elements of the political mood is the sense of a constant, bitter revolt against power, and the fact that incumbency is the worst political look of all. If today’s insurgents and troublemakers become tomorrow’s ruling establishment, the turbulence and complexity they feed off will soon come for them too.

A pope speaking up again and again for immigrants. Furious judges dressing down the Trump administration and ruling against it time after time after time, in response to the blizzard of lawsuits filed by human rights and environmental groups, states, cities and individuals. A senator speaking nonstop for 25 hours and another flying to El Salvador to find out what happened to his kidnapped constituent. The biggest day of protest in US history as an estimated 7 million people showed up for No Kings on 18 October in small towns and red counties as well as big blue cities.Weekly protests at Tesla salesrooms earlier this year that succeeded in damaging the brand, depressing global sales and prompting Tesla CEOElon Muskto retreat from his Doge slash-and-burn project. Federal workers resisting sometimes merely by adhering to law, truth and fact, and sometimes by speaking out as whistleblowers or in protests, as with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staff whostageda walkout in late August in solidarity with senior staff who’d just resigned in protest against the health and human services secretaryRobert F Kennedy Jr’s anti-vaccine policies.Extraordinary solidarity organizing for and with immigrants, refugees and the people targeted for looking like them on the streets, in the neighborhoods of Chicago, at Home Depot parking lots, around schools, in courtrooms. Democratic state attorneys general suing again and again, independently and together, and Illinois and California’s governors spending a lot of time ripping into Trump. Airports refusing to play the homeland security secretaryKristi Noem’s partisan-propaganda video about the congressional shutdown. Seven major universitiesrefusingto sign a contract with the administration promising financial incentives for compromising academic freedom. This is some of the resistance to the Trump administration and its policies we’ve seen since 20 January, and it’s worth surveying on the anniversary of the election.When people tell me that there’s been no resistance to the Trump administration, I wonder if they’re expecting something that looks like a guerrilla revolution pushing out the government in one fell swoop or just aren’t paying attention, because there has, in fact, been a tremendous amount and variety of resistance and opposition and it’s mattered tremendously. When will it be enough is a question that can only be answered if and when all this is over and we find out what comes next. Another source of disappointment seems to come from the expectation that there will be some sort of obvious and logical building up toward regime change, rather than the reality that tipping points in particular and histories in general are unpredictable animals.Resistance is everywhere, both geographically and in terms of the constituencies participating: civil society and civil servants; human rights, climate and environmental groups (who in many cases had plans in place before the election and hit the ground running when the new administration came in); religious leaders and institutions, elected officials at all levels from city councils to the US Senate, the military, lawyers and judges, educators and students, librarians, of course, medical professionals, journalists, editors and publishers, people in the arts. Of course there’s been shameful collaboration, submission and silence from many figures in most of these constituencies as well. It has been striking that the most wealthy and theoretically most powerful have, in this crisis, often been the first to surrender. It’s non-elites who have stood on principle even when it means taking risks.It wasn’t clear beforehand what the focal point of opposition would be, and the early protests against Doge and the Tesla Takedown actions were in response to the administration and Musk’s attacks on the federal government. Though activists and organizations are defending everything from renewable energy to reproductive rights, the heart of active resistance is now solidarity with those under attack by the border patrol, ICE and the other agencies assigned to terrorize, brutalize, kidnap and violate rights across the country. This manifests in myriad ways from volunteers striving to protect immigrants and refugees when they show up for their immigration-court appointments to neighbors walking kids to school when their parents are afraid to leave home to the lively protests in front of ICE in Portland, Oregon, and the extraordinary neighborhood activism across Los Angeles, and then Washington DC, and then Chicago.As Sarah Conwayreportedin New York Magazine: “In their free time, or, in some cases, by actively taking time off work, everyday Chicagoans are building rapid-response teams to keep eyes on the streets and follow the movements of federal agents. Some pass out whistles in bars and laundromats; others keep vigil outside Home Depots and taquerías. Activists have begun locating agents’ suburban hotels and hosting noisy protests outside. Some take shifts patrolling their neighborhoods on foot, in cars, and on bikes to alert neighbors to the presence of federal agents and to document their aggressive tactics and arrests.”The Catholic church has shown up, from a midwestern church that put cardboard silhouettes in the pews to represent members of the congregation afraid to attend to Chicago-bornPope Leo XIV. The new pope, seemingly in direct opposition to loud-about-his-Catholic-conversionJD Vance, has repeatedly spoken up for immigrants and the poor. It’s not just Catholics, though: ministers and rabbis have participated in protests, and more than 200 Chicago-area clergy signed a letter titled Jesus is Being Tear Gassed at Broadview. Many cities have reaffirmed their statuses as sanctuary cities and their policies of not cooperating with Ice.Miles Bruner, in resigning from his job as a Republican fundraiser,wrotein the Bulwark: “I quit the Republican party and my job as an accomplice to the party in the throes of an authoritarian cult.” Marine Col Doug Krugmanexplainedhis resignation from the military in the Washington Post: “Instead of trying to work within the Constitution, or to amend it, President Trump is testing how far he can ignore it.” The admiral who resigned abruptly from the navy’s southern command last month did not give a reason, but it was widely assumed to be in response to the murderous attacks on small boats in the Caribbean. The veterans group About Facelauncheda campaign on the Fourth of July to support military members refusing illegal orders and encouraging them to do so.Boycotts have always been a powerful tactic of nonviolent resistance. The Tesla, Target and Disney boycotts all had an effect, and Indivisible has justlaunchedone against Spotify for running Ice recruitment ads. The Disney boycott seems to be why late-night hostJimmy Kimmelgot reinstated after being pushed out for making mild remarks after far-right activistCharlie Kirkwas assassinated. Often acts of submission to the administration provoke their own acts of resistance, as when individual lawyers left some of the big law firms that caved to the administration early this year. A lot of journalists have left the Washington Post and other publications that have shifted right to go independent, and small, alternative and independent media have been a vital part of keeping the public informed and engaged.Indivisible has grown hugely in chapters and membership since the new administration took over, 50501 was founded soon after the inauguration to organize more activism and a number of other local and national resistance organizations have sprung up. Trump has called the resistance and progressives more generally “the enemy from within”. But the enemies of human rights, the rule of law, the balance of powers and the constitution, of voting rights and fair elections, of science and history, are in the partially demolished White House. If this country has a future, it’s in the streets, the courts, the movements and the continued exercise of free speech and freedom of assembly against this administration.Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

Early awareness is crucialThe modern mindis a column where experts discuss mental health issues they are seeing in their workSun 9 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Nov 2025 17.48 ESTShareWhen Mia*, 35, walks into my office, she looks composed and ready to start her day fresh with a counselling session. But having seen Mia for almost half a year now, I know she masks the truth behind her polished facade, and I notice the subtle tension in her shoulders that gives it away.Mia tells me that the night before, she had poured herself “just one glass of wine” to unwind after a long day. One glass became two, then three. It’s a pattern she has grown used to; a quiet ritual that helps her “switch off” from the racing thoughts that flood her mind when the day finally slows down.Mia’s story reflects what I have been seeing at a growing rate in my practice. As a psychotherapist, I have noticed a striking pattern: an increasing number of Australians who are turning to alcohol to manage theiranxiety.According to research, 34.9% of Australian adults who drank alcohol did so to relieve stress and 18.5% to deal with anxiety.The ‘immoral, unthinkable’ political dispute rupturing a friendship requires a delicate therapeutic approach I Bianca DennyRead moreWe are living in a time of what psychologists call global distress exposure. Never have we been so constantly reminded of crisis, conflict and instability. Even when we switch off our screens, the worries remain of financial strain, job insecurity, climate fears and the emotional fatigue that comes with feeling so powerless.For many, a drink at the end of the day becomes a quiet escape. Yet while alcohol may seem to offer short-term relief,it can worsen anxietyover time, disrupting sleep, heightening physiological stress and eroding emotional resilience.Research showsthat people experiencing anxiety are significantly more likely to drink at risky levels and that the relationship between the two often becomes cyclical: anxiety fuels drinking and drinking fuels anxiety.Left unchecked, anxiety can do more than cause worry. It can disrupt relationships, affect sleep and lead to harmful coping behaviours such as substance use or compulsive online habits. Early awareness is crucial. That’s why it’s important to take a moment to reflect on one’s own anxiety and recognise the signs before they become overwhelming.One of theonline anxiety self-assessmentsavailable can help people identify how their worries might be affecting their wellbeing. It’s not a diagnosis but a first step: a quiet space to check in with yourself, understand what’s happening beneath the surface and consider whether extra support could help. Sometimes that self-reflection is the beginning of real change.The truth is, we can’t turn off the world’s crises. But we can learn to listen to what our minds and bodies are telling us when the noise becomes too much.Anxiety, in its own way, is a signal that something within us needs care. Understanding it is the first step to easing it.In an age of endless updates, perhaps the most radical act of self-preservation is this: pause, breathe and take stock of your own state of mind. If the world feels overwhelming, don’t face it alone; seek support, talk to someone or take that small step of self-assessment. Sometimes, that pause can be the beginning of feeling safe again.*All clients discussed are fictional amalgamsDiane Young is a trauma specialist and psychotherapist atSouth Pacific Private, a trauma, addiction and mental health treatment centreIn Australia, support is available at Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636, Lifeline on 13 11 14, and at MensLine on 1300 789 978.

Surely even he must realise that unilateral US military intervention wouldinvite disaster. And he’s got his facts wrong. The threat of Islamist terrorism is real, but itaffects Nigerian Muslimsas much, if not more, than Christians. There’s no evidence of genocide, contrary to the alarmist claims of US far-right internet warriors. Trump’s intervention was about politics, not faith.In speaking out, he was massaging a key domestic constituency, not acting from genuine, God-fearing concern for “our cherished Christians” in a land he’s never visited.Christian nationalist votes helped clinchTrump’s two presidential victories despite the obvious insincerity of his professed beliefs. His support among white evangelical Protestants is much higher than the average – 72% in April, compared with 40% among all US adults. Trump’s histrionics about Nigeria were primarily for their (and his) benefit.Cynical efforts by political leaders to harness and exploit religious sentiment are as old as human society. Through his conversion, the fourth-century Roman emperor Constantine co-opted the rising power ofChristianity. Medieval popes battled European monarchs who presumed to rule by divine right. England’s King Henry VIII, a self-worshipping misogynist like Trump, even invented his own (Anglican) church. Until 1946, Japan’s Shinto emperor counted himself a living god. The House of Saud gained in authority from overseeing Islam’s holiest sites. And given the way he behaves, Iran’s ageing supreme leader must surely have a direct line to Allah.Today’s generation of secular authoritarian leaders is similarly intent on exercising absolute power. They, too, are eager for the legitimisation, influence and leverage established religions can offer. They also demand obedience and subservience from the faithful, the more so now due to anaccelerating global religious revivalfor which their sinful earthly depredations are partly responsible.Take Vladimir Putin. The personification of evil in Ukrainian eyes, he has successfullyrecruited the Russian Orthodox churchto his cause. Its primate, Kirill, “Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus”, enthusiastically endorses Putin’s neo-imperial ambition to restore the so-called “Russian world” and reinforce “traditional” conservative values. For Kirill, Ukraine is a “holy war”. The late Pope Francis called him “Putin’s altar boy”.Narendra Modi operates on an altogether higher plane. His seductively mystical conflation of Hinduism, India’s majority religion, with his chauvinist brand of ultra-nationalism has won him three consecutive terms as prime minister. Supporters say he has divine powers. Critics say amessianic personality cultis undermining democracy. Amid rising anti-minority hate speech, India’s 200 million Muslims recall the2002 pogrom in Gujarat,when Modi was chief minister, and pray it’s not repeated.Compared with Modi, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s Islamist populist president, has feet of clay – the Book of Daniel’s biblical metaphor for a kingdom lacking firm foundations. For more than 20 years, the “new sultan” haschipped awayat secular shibboleths governing public life, education and the wearing of headscarves. Fears that heplans a new Islamist constitutionfuel the latest backlash. Turkey’s experience shows how dangerously divisive and undemocratic the politicising of faith can be.If they’re unable to co-opt believers, authoritarian states seek to control or suppress them. China isone of the worst. Under Xi Jinping, leader of the officially atheist Communist party, religious persecution has increased significantly. Muslims in Xinjiang and Buddhists in Tibet suffer appalling abuses. Last month saw arenewed crackdownon unauthorised Christian “house churches”. A 2016 Xi diktat requires the “Sinicisation” of all religions.The reported worldwide revival in religious observance and spiritual practice poses a challenge to authoritarian exploitation and political control, and comes in direct reaction to it. In the US, where Trump routinely pits Christians and Jews against Muslims (behaviour seen again in last week’sNew York mayoral election),a recent survey found 31% of respondents believereligion is gaining influencein American life – the highest figure for 15 years. And 59% welcome the change.In the UK, churchattendance is growing, especially among young men, after years of decline, a Bible Society poll indicated. Similar trends are evident among European Catholics, withgen Z setting the pace. In France, baptisms of 18- to 25-year-olds havemore than quadrupledsince 2021. Likewise, globally,attendance at Shinto shrinesand Buddhist retreats is reportedly up. In Turkey and India, too, the politicisation of religion has increased engagement among younger people. Some reject it, others embrace it.Numerous factorsexplain the resurgent interest in established belief systems. Economic insecurity and an impersonal, digitalised world exacerbate social isolation, feeding a need for belonging, meaning, community and identity. Today’s global hellscape of war, conflict and want is frightening; faith may vanquish fear. Demographic change, including migration, boosts church and mosque congregations in countries such as the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Online platforms like Albertine’s play an expanding role in carrying religious ideas to the disenfranchised, alienated young.Demand is plainly growing. In a world where authoritarian leaders trash the old rules-based order, where brute force, injustice, inequality and the relentless despoliation of nature are the norm, where genocide goes unpunished and war criminals thrive – and where truth and morality are warped and twisted to serve secular political ends – is it really any wonder people yearn for a different, better, faithful way?In order to hope, to banish despair, to stay sane, it seems people of all nations need something to hold on to.

Reeves should not cut welfare to placate the CityRichard PartingtonKeeping the markets on side is the chancellor’s priority but it’s not an easy task given their simplistic, misplaced views on welfare cutsSun 9 Nov 2025 06.56 ESTFirst published on Sun 9 Nov 2025 06.40 ESTShareThere are less than three weeks to go. In the lengthy wait for Rachel Reeves’sautumn budget, the chancellor will on Monday get the first verdict on her tax and spending plans from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).After the interminable weeks of speculation, kite flying and bad headlines, this moment matters. Has the widely anticipated fiscal gap of up to £30bn been filled? At what cost for growth, inflation, and living standards?Heading into this moment the chancellor can take some heart. Gilt markets haverallied in recent weeks, bringing down the cost of government borrowing. What the OBR thinks is one thing. But the bond market is theintimidator-in-chiefof governments the world over.A million young people aren’t in a job or training. Britain has a problem | Richard PartingtonRead moreThe backdrop in global markets has helped in recent weeks. FallingUS borrowing costsare a tailwind. Reeves has also succeeded in rolling the pitch for jittery investors in UK government debt by talking up her commitment to fiscal discipline. The negative space framing the chancellor’s otherwise vacuousspeechlast week was the acknowledgment that taxes will rise, spending could be cut.Keeping the bond market on side is important. There are plenty of voices arguing the dangers are overplayed. But Reeves is right to say there is “nothing progressive, nothing Labour” about risking a bond market reaction that would drive up borrowing costs. However, there is a fine line to tread. Bending to the bond market view is no risk-free bet.In the City, investors are looking for Reeves to be tough on public spending in particular. Doing so would send out the strongestmessage of budget disciplineto the bond market – far more than a manifesto-busting round of tax hikes.As debt market analysts at Barclays put it last month: “Spending reform is now seen as a totemic issue by the market.” That Keir Starmer’s government foundered in its attempt to cut£5bn from welfare earlier this yearwas “a red flag from the perspective of the gilt market,” they said.At the same time, bond investors worry big tax increases could torpedo Britain’s growth prospects. Doing so would lock the country in a debt-laden, low-growth doom loop.“The gilt market can see the more you’re sticking up taxes, the more that you’re trashing growth,” says Mark Dowding, the chief investment officer at the hedge fund RBC BlueBay. He would rather Reeves prevent a “culture of benefits dependency” from taking root by cutting welfare.“The tax burden is already historically high, and if spending continues to move on an upwards trajectory, you’re almost saying that taxes will need to continue to increase. That doesn’t feel sustainable.”Reeves will need to be alive to the risk that tax rises could hit growth – the government’s No 1 mission. TheBank of Englandcould take some of the slack by cutting rates. But it is a gamble. A slowdown would sap tax receipts, living standards. Efforts to balance the books and Labour’s re-election chances would take a serious knock.However, the welfare-cutting bias in the City is simplistic, misplaced, and could condemn Britain to a worse trajectory.”Cutting welfare might sound an attractive cost saver. Total spending in cash terms is rising at a dramatic rate: from roughly £300bn to about £370bn by the end of the decade – largely as a result of the pensions triple lock and rising disability and health-related benefit caseloads.Britain is an ageing and increasingly unwell nation, fuelled not just by simple demographic changes; but also an underperforming economy and crumbling public services. A fifth of the population is of retirement age, and as life expectancy increases and the baby boomer generation reaches older age, these changes will only accelerate. The welfare bill is a reflection of this.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Pensioners get most of the money, with 13.1 million recipients. Much of the rest goes to 10 million working-age adults, most through universal credit – where more than a third of claimants are in work.Despite these pressures, total welfare spending is projected to remain flat as a percentage of GDP up to the end of the decade. Tell this to the next person who says welfare spending is on an unsustainable path but holding the defence budget constant as a share of national income is a disaster.For all of the pressure on the state, overall working-age welfare spending isflat and similar to the levels in 2015. Cash spending on health-related benefits is rising, but as a share of GDP it is lower now than in the 1990s.When push comes to shove, welfare cuts affect more people than might be immediately imagined in the othering narratives about welfare scroungers. Evidence shows health-related benefit cuts woulddrive up poverty, not employment. Meanwhile, taking money out of the pockets of vulnerable people would reduce spending in the economy. Raising taxes is not the only way to slow an economy to stall speed.Increasingly, there is recognition that Britain’s economic prospects have been undermined by the erosion of the country’s social safety net.The debate at the last election was centred on boosting growth to fund public services and the welfare state. But this negates the point that the relationship between the two is symbiotic. The last decade and a half of austerity is proof enough.Explore more on these topicsOffice for Budget ResponsibilityEconomics viewpointBondsGiltsEconomic growth (GDP)Economic policyEconomicsBudget deficitcommentShareReuse this content"

Surely, that is the definition of spoiling your own fun? “Like going into a corn maze and just wanting a straight line to the end,” says one TikToker quoted in the article. There’s also an interview with a keen reader who uses ChatGPT as a book club replacement, scraping the internet and aggregating “stimulating opinions and perspectives”. All well and good (actually, no, it sounds bleak as hell) until he had a character’s death spoilered in the fantasy epic he had been enjoying.Meanwhile, Substack seems to be clogging up with AI-generated essays. The nu-blogging platform is an earnestly artisanal space where writers craft their stuff; subcontracting that to a bot seems like the acme of pointlessness. Will Storr, who writes about storytelling, examines this boggling trend and the tells that give it away onhis own Substack, including a penchant for what he calls “the impersonal universal”: sweeping statements that sound deep but aren’t. There is, he says, “A white-noise generality to its insights, an uncanny vagueness that makes the mind glaze over.”I’m baffled how anyone could enjoy using a large language model (LLM) to sound blandly “clever” or participate in any AI-hacked hobby. It doesn’t matter much, I suppose – this isn’t AI as existential threat. But it matters for fun – let the bots take our work, but not our joy! I wouldn’t presume to tell anyone how to enjoy themselves – I’mno expert on fun, and would definitely end up sounding like an AI-generated Substack if I did (hug a tree, speak to a stranger, laugh with loved ones). But I have been thinking what makesmefeel most vividly alive and I’m aiming to do more of it – my individual fightback against the “impersonal universal”.The first one is singing. I expect AI can scrape the musical canon to compose an ethereal robot madrigal, but it can’t conjure the eccentric entertainment of my small choir composed of very particular humans. We’re not the most polished singers, but listening to one another and trying to blend our voices gives me an intense sense of connection (research agrees: group singing mediatesspeedy social bonding). Occasionally, everything comes together and we produce a few seconds of surprising beauty, earning our choir director’s sparingly granted, quietly mimed chef’s kiss. When it doesn’t, it’s fun anyway.The next is stuff – not my own but other people’s. I find the idiosyncratic things people prize, acquire and discard endlessly stimulating. I usually get my fix at York’s weekly car boot sale – an overwhelming jumble of inexpertly stuffed badgers, Power Rangers merch, fishing tackle and ceramic mice dressed as Victorian washerwomen that makes my heart sing. It works with more exalted stuff, too, especially textiles in Renaissance paintings: clothes, rugs, curtains, tapestries. I recently spent a heady 10 minutes in a miraculously empty room in gathering darkness at New York’s Frick Collection withHolbein’s portrait of Thomas More, examining his fur collar and red velvet sleeves and imagining how they felt and why he chose them.I get a fair amount of unbridled joy from simply being an animal: walking, digging in the soil and watching other animals (OK, yes, I mean birds), but mostly – and I say this as a lifelong introvert – I get it from people. When I try to identify my most reliable source of pleasure, it’s wandering round a strange city looking at its inhabitants. What are people wearing, eating, talking about; what pisses them off; what kind of dogs do they have? From toddler tantrums to displays of affection to queue etiquette, it’s an all-you-can-eat human buffet. I just watchedI Am Martin Parr, a documentary on the photographer with a magpie eye for the essence of British life, and he gets it. Now in his 70s, Parr is as driven to observe and document people in all their beautifully strange specificity as ever; he is, he says, “still excited about going out and seeing this crazy world we live in.”That’s the secret for me: AI can obligingly aggregate and explain what we are en masse, but it blends all our colours to a muddy brown; it can’t capture the joy of the absolutely particular.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionComputingHobbiesSubstackcommentShareReuse this content"

What if that’s a good thing?Hanna Thomas UoseAuthors are sounding warnings about the length of the modern attention span, but my series of abandonments is a sign of something elseSun 9 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Nov 2025 13.51 ESTShareThis is embarrassing, but here goes. There are five novels beside my bed, all partially read. On my phone, I am partway through 36 audiobooks, which pales in comparison to the 46 ebooks I have abandoned on my Kindle. This doesn’t count the growing pile of advance copies beside my coffee table, vying for blurbs, now that I am a published novelist myself.At first glance, these stats seem to corroborate Ian Rankin’s words. Commentinga fortnight agoon how easy it is to lose a reader’s focus, when it is fragmented by social media and the news cycle, the writer said: “Maybe as people’s attention spans change the literature will have to change with them.” But as someone who used to doggedly finish whatever I was reading, I now consider it a human right to put down a book that I’m not in the mood for.I don’t believe that this habit is due to my short attention span – rather more to the feeling of life slipping through my fingers. I’ve always been struck by the Benedictine teaching: “Keep death daily before your eyes.” Oliver Burkeman’s reminder that we each have a mere4,000 weekson this Earth was as horrifying to me as to anyone else. And yet at what other point in human history have we ever had such immediate access to so many mind-blowing works of art, whenever we want? A glut of riches awaits me in every bookshop and behind every screen, and I want to be intentional about where I direct my attention. Could “DNF-ing” a novel (shorthand in the book world for Did Not Finish) be not a sign of a weak mind, but a discerning one?Especially at a time when publishing (and therefore, commissioning) is still dominated by a certain social class and its quandaries. While reading about people different from ourselves can help tobuild the muscle for empathy, we also read to reflect on our own lives and place in the world. Until the books on the shelves better reflect the identities, lives and concerns of potential readers, it might be very hard to hold their attention.Of course, some authorsaresuccessfully writing for the “modern attention span”: the tweet-length prose of Patricia Lockwood’sNo One Is Talking About This,the tight fragments of Jenny Offill’sDept. of Speculation, and the short chapters of Chris Whitaker’sAll the Colours of the Darkare all a wonderful showcase for a shorter form and style. And there is no shortage of writing advice geared toward grabbing a reader: hone that first sentence, polish that opening chapter, elevate the stakes (higher! higher!) and, if writing crime, put a dead body on the first page. This is all sound advice – a potential agent, publisher or reader will spend only a few precious minutes deciding whether or not to forge ahead. There is no point in being contrary, like the person on a writing course I attended who, when challenged about the plot of their novel, declared that “it all becomes clear about three-quarters of the way through”. No writer should put their reader through a series of 12 labours in order to be understood.And I do write to be understood, as much as that is possible. Sometimes that requires holding the reader’s hand, guiding them through the story beat by economical beat. Sometimes, I’ve realised, understanding takes patience – and I must give myself (and other writers) the grace of meandering, of layering, of digressing, until I hit upon something true. Jane Alison, author of the craft book Meander, Spiral, Explodeargues for the novel finding new forms and that, rather than the traditional dramatic arc, “other patterns might help us imagine new ways to make our narratives vital and true, keep making our novels novel”.In that sense, Rankin and Alison both agree – the novel may have to change to accommodate the modern reader, as it has continually done since it first emerged in the 18th century (in the form that we know it today). Perhaps, like Charles Dickens and Helen Fielding, authors will go back to serialising their novels in the newspapers. The next such authors may already be releasing their work, chapter by chapter, on online platforms such asWattpad, visited by more than 90 million monthly users. Art forms change with the times and we should let them.But let us not say that any changes are all because of shorter attention spans. If that was so, short story collections and flash fiction would be considered much more commercial bets than they are now. And, if we were to follow that argument to its endpoint, the answer may be not to write at all – to admit defeat against VR and AI-generated content in the battle for attention, and let the robots take over. I trust that is not what Rankin, or what most of us, want.Personally, I am more worried about the implications of the “modern attention span” for my own ability to write, rather than read. After this, I will go and flip my sand timer while sitting on a silent Zoom call with six other authors, hoping that their diligent typing will successfully spur me on with my second book. And should a newspaper ever want a serialised novel? They know where to find me.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those most vulnerable to sexual harassment, assault and abuse are, unsurprisingly, those who have less power or are treated with less respect: undocumented migrants; women in precarious employment; women with disabilities; LGBTQ women; young women and girls.Paradoxically, that helps to explain whythe assault of Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, has drawnsuch outragedomestically and internationally. A drunken man tried to kiss her neck and grabbed her chest as she spoke to citizens in the capital’s streets. It is the proof, captured on camera, that no woman is safe. You can be the most powerful person in the land and a man will still feel entitled to grope you, in front of the world, because you are a woman. When you object,some will complainthat you are taking it too seriously, or that it is all made up. As Ms Sheinbaum herself remarked: “If they do this to the president, then what will happen to all the young women in our country?”One in five girls and women inMexicosaid they had experienced sexual violence in the community (as distinct from home, schools and workplaces) in the previous year, according to official figures from 2021. Ten women are killed each day. Ms Sheinbaum, like others, has noted the country’smachistareputation previously. But the problem does not end there. In the US and the UK, surveys suggest four out of five women (and two out of five men) have experienced sexual harassment and assault. When those at the top are targeted, it sends a message to all women, and often deliberately so. Whatever their accomplishments – Ms Sheinbaum is also an environmental scientist who contributed to the reports of the Nobel peace prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – they can be reduced to their bodies.Julia Gillard, Australia’s only female prime minister, was described as “deliberately barren”. Kamala Harris has long faced explicitly sexual rhetorical attacks. When the then prime minister Theresa May met Nicola Sturgeon in 2017,the front page of the Daily Mailasked of the two national leaders: “Never mind Brexit, who won Legs-it!” Politicians in general face an increasingly angry and violent political culture – in Mexico, many are killed each year – but women also face growing and more open sexism. The Reykjavik Index for Leadership, which measures perceptions in the G7 and Iceland,foundlast year that in the US, less than half of respondents felt “very comfortable” with the idea of a female political leader.Ms Sheinbaum is to be commended for pressing for charges and has rightly called for sexual harassment to be criminalised nationwide; many Mexican states have yet to do so. Yet, as mayor of Mexico City, when police cracked down on feminists demonstrating against gender-based violence,she referred to the protests as “provocations”. Women’s services havefaced cutsunder her administration. That does not lessen the importance of her stand this week. But it demonstrates that female leadership does not inevitably benefit women at the bottom, whatever they have in common with those at the top. Expanded social security programmes, initiated under Ms Sheinbaum’s predecessor,are already benefiting single mothersand others. But the president should seize this opportunity to embrace Mexico’s energetic grassroots feminist movement wholeheartedly, and work with it to tackle violence and misogyny, in the interests of all women.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

New legislation suggests democrats still fear powerful interestsSun 9 Nov 2025 12.25 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Nov 2025 15.31 ESTShareNo other European country has such a narrow base of proprietorship as Scotland. Half of all privately owned rural land isheldby 421 people or entities. The roots of such disparities lie in the past. The 18th- and 19th-century Highland clearances emptied the glens and readied them for private takeover. On the continent, and eventually in England, the great estates were broken up by inheritance and land taxes. By comparison, Scotland is still feudal in scale.The passing of a land reform bill, its supporters say, will change that. But doubts remain. Its proponents say the legislation could allow the Scottish government to intervene in private land sales and require large estates to be broken up. At its heart is the so-calledtransfer test. This would see Scottish ministers notified before any land sale over 1,000 hectares. However, they lack an explicit veto. If they wanted a more democratic constraint, they could have adopted the Scottish Land Commission’s 2019 proposal for apublic interest test– forcing big buyers to openly justify their purchases.Scottish ministers point out that by getting landowners to tell the government before any large-scale sale, they can give community groups a chance to put together a rival bid. But many big estates lie in sparsely populated upland areas where communities lack purchasing power. In theory, new “lotting” rules in the bill could diversify ownership by potentially splitting large sales into smaller plots. Yet the land reform expert Andy Wightmanarguesthat such powers will rarely be used – and even then, existing landowners can simply buy the lots back. Mr Wightman, a former Green MSP, argues persuasively that thepattern of ownershipresults from a free market in land which privileges those with the deepest pockets. His reasoning is that Scotland’s land should beregulatedas a shared resource in the public interest.Devolution has made this debate possible. Before 1999, Scottish land reform would have stalled in the Lords, where rich landlords literally sat in judgment. Despite more than a quarter of a century of argument, Scottish ministers are reluctant to adopt a more radical shake up.Craig Dalzell at the Common Weal thinktank suggests that a localland levywould make hoarding costly and fund community investment. The same council powers were used for Scotland’stourist tax. Common Wealarguesthat Scotland should emulate Nordic nations, where smart taxes ensure smaller rural holdings. Significantly, they also encourage more sustainable patterns of forestry, farming and recreational use rather than absentee rents or speculation.Scottish land reform became a flashpoint in the2014 independence campaign, because it raised questions of power and sovereignty that drove the wider debate. Yet it was the ruling Scottish National party that last month voted down attempts by opposition MSPs to place a cap on the amount of land that a single entity could own unless they could meet strict limits. No doubt SNP ministers feared scaring off investment, particularly in forest land brought for carbonoffsetting, or being accused of confiscatory nationalism.The Scottish government’s reasoning – that ownership caps would be “a gift to those who want to maintain the status quo” – got it backwards. By refusing caps, Holyrood preserved the status quo itself. How tightly Scotland retains old structures of land and power depends on whether its democracy has the courage to break the bond.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

My concern is with their modesty in such extreme times. Research has revealed that80% of headteachers in Englandthink their role has a negative impact on their quality of life, with many making plans to retire or leave the profession early. And75% of 16- to 25-year-oldsdescribe the future as “frightening”, with justified anxiety about climate breakdown prevalent. So why focus on trimming the sails rather than turning the wheel?The suggestion of10% less GCSE exam timeand slightly reduced content is welcome. But as education is now compulsory until 18, why do we need GCSEs at all? Our teens spend more time preparing for exams than engaging in depth with the topics they cover, with a relentless prioritisation of targeted performance over broad intellectual, social and emotional development. A little more time on PSHE (personal, social, health and economic education) and sports is great, but not a solution. Teaching more about climate change without giving young people the skills and opportunities to take thoughtful, substantive action is likely to backfire, making them feel both responsible and powerless.The review we truly need would start by breaking a taboo: acknowledging that schooling’s current structure aims to give individuals the chance to demonstrate their superior worth to others and be rewarded with limited higher-value positions in working life. Often euphemised as “social mobility”, it lies in tatters as parental income continues to shape children’s economic success.As the world continues to catch fire, that new review would set out new pragmatic and humane principles for our critical times – that cooperation, more than competition, will secure young people’s futures, and that knowledge without the capacity to bring about change is a fast-devaluing currency.Curriculums that enable these principles already exist – many academics and teachers restlessly await the chance to implement them.Dr Rupert HighamAssociate professor, UCL Institute of EducationAt last, the curriculum review has confirmed what creatives up and down the country have long campaigned for: the end of theEnglish baccalaureate(Ebacc). The qualification had a woeful oversight at its heart – an absence of arts and vocational subjects.Creative subjects should never have been treated like an optional extra for our children’s education. They provide young people with communication skills, independence and adaptability, supporting employability across a range of sectors.This move begins to repair the damage done by years of narrowing focus. Yet that progress will only endure if it is matched by joined-up reform beyond the classroom.The important work of creative education doesn’t stop at 16, but proposed changes set out in thepost-16 education and skills white paperraise important questions about this continuation. The new V-levels aim to simplify level 3 qualifications, but it is still unclear if creative subjects will be eligible for maintenance support.Unless we join these dots, creativity will be left at the school gate – and the pipeline cut short. Post-16 policy must build on what schools have just regained. A rounded, cohesive, creative education is one of the most powerful investments this country could make. That cannot stop at 16.Caroline NorburyChief executive, Creative UKAny rethink of the national curriculum, ambitious or otherwise, faces at least two intractable difficulties. One is captured in the observation “Curriculum is a 10-letter word; that’s the extent of agreement about curriculum”. The other is “Everyone is in favour of reform; it’s change that isn’t liked and will be resisted”. With these caveats in mind, the curriculum and assessment report is a valuable, though overambitious, document that underplays the very difficulties facing the implementation of its many proposals.Prof Colin RichardsSpark Bridge, CumbriaHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

As part of this, we should also specifically acknowledge the impact of women’s health issues and the role of employers in addressing these.In a report by the NHS Confederation in partnership with our foundation, we found that an estimated£11bn is lost annuallydue to absenteeism for gynaecological conditions alone. And earlier this year,our researchfound that 15% of women report having to change to part-time work and 14% have had to quit work due to women’s health conditions. Furthermore, 32% of women reported that they aren’t receiving enough support for their health issues from their employers.It is therefore essential that employers take action as a matter of urgency. For too long, women have faced persistent inequalities in their career aspirations, and a lack of support for reproductive health issues is one such barrier.It is positive to see that the review has highlighted the impact of ill health of the UK’s workforce, and its recommended investment from employers could prove transformational. We also welcome the government’s plans to renew thewomen’s health strategy, which could provide employers with the guidelines they need to better support women’s health in the workplace. These two commitments together could truly boost the UK’s economy.Prof Geeta NargundFounder, Create Health FoundationHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

As an Italian, vigilantism is for me always a road to fascism, but as an academic, I’m also struck by the contradictions that your article did not pick up on.So the road is for everyone, as we all have a right to walking, but if I want a stroll I should “go to a park”? How about areas that don’t have a park? The issue is that we live in a disconnected world, but two people having a conversation as they walk, or a group having a chat must be shamed? I’m sure Roh pays attention to elderly people and children, but how about hidden disabilities?As the mother of a young child, a person with a job that demands flexibility and who was subject to stalking, I have been in the situation of having to look at my phone on my way to the tube.I have always tried to be considerate to fellow walkers, but, especially as a mother and a victim, I shouldn’t also have to be worried about a total stranger filming me. And I’m certainly not ready to walk in the efficient single line that is advocated so that it is deemed adequate by some self-appointed judge.Dr Tiziana MorosettiLondonOne of my great bugbears regarding pavement pedestrians walking in opposite directions is – in which direction should they give way when passing?

Norris gave a performance of precision and control exactly when it was required to put real daylight on his two title rivals.Lewis Hamilton laments ‘nightmare’ first season driving for FerrariRead moreYet Verstappen, as ever, was irrepressible at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace, where he drove from 17th to victory last season and is now the scene of two of his best drives. With Verstappen andRed Bullhaving found the pace that eluded them all weekend after taking a new engine and employing a new setup after a dire qualifying, he scythed through the field with verve and dash that was a joy to watch.Every opening he went for he made, even as he made three pit stops, including an early one for a slow puncture. He had to come back from 19th at the start then 18th after his first stop and yet his rise through the field appeared inexorable.Norris matched him with the controlled drive required to convert his pole and in so doing now has the whip hand. After scoring the maximum possible points with victories in the sprint and the GP, Norris has a 24‑point advantage over Piastri while Verstappen is 49 points behind, with 83 points still to race for in the final three meetings at Las Vegas, Qatar and Abu Dhabi.The turnaround for Norris, with his seventh victory this season, has been extraordinary since he was 34 points behind Piastri after the Dutch GP in August – a period when his credentials as a world champion and whether he had the steel to fight for it were being questioned. They were opinions he felt he had answered emphatically when asked on the reasons for his recent form.“Just ignore everyone who talks crap about you and focus on yourself,” he said. “There’s not a long way to go but it can change so quickly, like we’ve seen today. So, just focus on myself, keep my head down, ignore everyone and keep pushing.”View image in fullscreenRed Bull’s Max Verstappen came from the pit lane to finish third.Photograph: Amanda Perobelli/ReutersFor all that Verstappen played centre stage with a captivating soliloquy, Norris’s performance drives the narrative: a decisive moment in the title race given that Piastri endured another blow to his hopes. Starting from fourth he took an early 10‑second penalty for causing a collision when he locked up and hit Kimi Antonelli at turn one. Although he delivered a strong performance to recover, the damage was done.Piastri might feel aggrieved that he was not at fault as he made a legitimate move up the inside and that Antonelli had not given him enough space, but he has been on the back foot all weekend. He crashed out in the sprint race while Norris completed the full monty of pole and victory in both disciplines.Drivers’ standingsAfter taking pole on Saturday Norris had acknowledged that he had addressed weaknesses in his performances this season and noticeably was now expressing a quiet confidence in how he was driving. Norris can, as he has admitted, be a glass half-empty character, unafraid of self-criticism – so that he now feels he really is on top of his game is telling and was manifest from his control in a tough test in Brazil.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As the race ebbed and flowed, a complex challenge marked by varying tyre strategies was made all the more intriguing by Verstappen barrelling about as an excitable stallion as he advanced on the leaders – theMcLarenpit wall and Norris having to factor in a Red Bull that had looked all but irrelevant on Saturday afternoon.Having opted to take the penalty and start Verstappen from the pit lane in an effort to address the setup issues which had left him struggling so badly, Red Bull’s boldness paid off. His pace at times was fearsome, up to a second and half up on Norris, who insisted the world champion remained a player in the title race.“With how quick he was today, he probably would have won if he started higher up.” he said, “He will be a threat, he always is, he is always fighting and will fight to the end. When asked if he could have covered Verstappen’s pace in a straight fight, he gave an unequivocal “no”.It is, nonetheless, Norris who holds all the cards, but Verstappen demonstrated in striking fashionhe really is not quite ready to forget the championship yet.Antonelli took a superb career-best second for Mercedes, with his teammate, George Russell, in fourth and Haas’s Ollie Bearman an excellent sixth. Lewis Hamilton endured another disappointing race, forced to retire his Ferrari after taking floor damage in the opening laps.Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2025Lando NorrisOscar PiastriMax VerstappenMcLarenRed BullFormula OnenewsShareReuse this content"

Their present form is in stark contrast to that of 12 months ago when England were mired in a run of six defeats in seven games, all by narrow margins. Three of those losses were inflicted by New Zealand – two on the 2024 summer tour before a 24‑22 defeat at Twickenham after George Ford missed two late kicks at goal.New Zealand edged out Scotlandon Saturday to keep alive the All Blacks’ hopes of a home nations grand slam and, though the Springboks cemented their spot at the top of the rankings by beating France, George has heralded New Zealand as “arguably the best side in the world”. Of the past 11 meetings, England’s only win against New Zealand came in the 2019 World Cup semi-final and the All Blacks have not been beaten in the past five games at Twickenham.“What a lot of teams do is sit back in awe of the All Blacks with their history and all their incredible players,” George said. “It’s easy to do that. I’ve probably done it. We’ve also got to be aware we’ll be back here at Allianz Stadium. We’re very proud to be playing here. We are going to do everything we can to win that game.“You have to be at your best. New Zealand are arguably the best side in the world at the minute. They’re an unbelievably fantastic team and they seem to step up a gear when they come to Allianz Stadium.“The important thing for us to do is work out where we could have been better in the first half this week. But also have a clear gameplan which can put them under as much pressure as we possibly can. If we do that, we’ll give ourselves a chance.“We came under a bit of heat 12 months ago for not coming out on the right side of tight games and not finding a way to win. Now we’re doing the exact opposite. By no means have we cracked it. But we’ve placed a big emphasis on the latter stages of games and closing games out. Scoring however many tries in the last quarter of that game is a sign of a good team.”Borthwick is again expected to make a number of changes to his side with the captain, Maro Itoje, Tom Curry and Ford all expected to return to the starting lineup. Tommy Freeman and Immanuel Feyi‑Waboso were both in the wars against Fiji but have been selected in the squad to face the All Blacks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So I’m sure next week’s going to be a great assessment for us.”Ben Earl, meanwhile, believes that England’s present ability to pull clear in the closing stages of matches owes much to their three narrow defeats by New Zealand last year. “You feel battle-hardened, you feel like you’ve got the wounds, you’ve got the scar tissue to learn from those losses, and they hurt at the time,” said Earl, who was named man of the match against Fiji.“But I wonder, to a man in the changing room, would we have changed our journey now, with the joy that we’re sometimes enjoying now? I’d be interested to know because I think they’re very, very valuable lessons.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamNew Zealand rugby union teamRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The Bills (6-3) had not lost to Miami (3-7) since Week 3 of the 2022 season but came out flat on Sunday.Achane finished with 225 scrimmage yards and fourth-quarter touchdowns of 59 and 35 yards. Tagovailoa completed 15 of 21 passes with two interceptions to give him a league-leading 12 picks this season. It was also the most dominant performance of the season for Miami’s defense, which had three takeaways and three sacks. Josh Allen threw for 306 yards and two touchdowns, with an interception and fumble, but was replaced by Mitchell Trubisky after Achane’s second TD put the Dolphins up by 17 with three minutes left.Jacksonville Jaguars 29-36 Houston TexansDavis Mills delivered a trio of fourth-quarter touchdowns to help the Houston Texans erase a 19-point deficit and rally for victory over the visiting Jacksonville Jaguars (5-4). Mills completed 27 of 45 passes for 292 yards, two touchdowns and an interception in his first start since January 2023 as he took the place of CJ Stroud, who was absent through concussion. Mills led the Texans on three straight scoring drives after they fell behind 29-10 with 1:33 left in the third quarter. After touchdown passes with 12:16 and 7:29 left, the game-winning drive for a TD came on a 14-yard Mills scramble on third-and-goal with 30 seconds left, finishing off an improbable comeback for a win the Texans (4-5) badly needed. The win marked the biggest fourth-quarter comeback in Texans franchise history.Los Angeles Rams 42-26 San Francisco 49ersMatthew Stafford threw four touchdown passes, setting a Rams franchise record for the most in a three-game span as Los Angeles beat the San Francisco 49ers (6-4) on Sunday, marking their fourth straight win. Kyren Williams added two touchdown runs for the Rams, who hold a 7-2 record. Stafford has been a key player, with 20 touchdown passes and no interceptions in the past six games.Detroit Lions 44-22 Washington CommandersJared Goff threw three TD passes and Jahmyr Gibbs found the end zone three times to help the Detroit Lions earn a bounce-back win over the Washington Commanders in front of Donald Trump. Dan Campbell’s Lions do not lose consecutive games and the head coach seemingly took over play-calling Sunday to rebound after a defeat last time out.With Trump watchingfrom a suite after arriving late in the first half – making him the first sitting US president at a regular-season NFL game since 1978, and just the third ever – the Lions scored the first 22 points and never looked back. Washington have lost five games in a row.New York Giants 20-24 Chicago BearsCaleb Williams threw a touchdown pass and scrambled for a go-ahead score in the fourth quarter, helping the Chicago Bears beat Jaxson Dart, who left the game with a concussion, and the New York Giants (2-8). Led by Williams, Chicago scored the last 14 points after Younghoe Koo’s 19-yard field goal gave New York a 20-10 lead with 10:19 left. CJ Gardner-Johnson had two sacks for the 6-3 Bears, including one of Russell Wilson on a key third down in the final period. Williams sparked the rally with a two-yard touchdown pass to Rome Odunze, making it 20-17 with 3:56 left.Atlanta Falcons 25-31 Indianapolis Colts (OT)Jonathan Taylor completed a 244-yard rushing day with a touchdown run in overtime to give the Indianapolis Colts (8-2) victory over the Atlanta Falcons (3-6) in the first regular-seasonNFLgame in Berlin. It was Taylor’s third touchdown of the game and came after Colts kicker Michael Badgley tied the game with a 44-yard field goal with 25 seconds left. Tyler Allgeier’s second touchdown was a one-yard plunge that give the Falcons a 25-22 lead with 1:44 left in regulation.Arizona Cardinals 22-44 Seattle SeahawksThe Seattle Seahawks dominated the first half on the way to a convincing win over the Arizona Cardinals. DeMarcus Lawrence returned two fumbles for touchdowns in the first half. He became the sixth player since at least 1991 with at least two defensive TDs in a half. Seattle led 38-7 at halftime and cruised from there to improve to 7-2. The Cardinals fell to 3-6. Sam Darnold threw a TD pass to Jaxon Smith-Njigba on the Seahawks’ first possession. The NFC West-leading Seahawks beat their division rivals for the ninth straight time, and this one was hardly competitive.New England Patriots 28–23 Tampa Bay BuccaneersTreVeyon Henderson had touchdown runs of 69 and 55 yards, Drake Maye threw two TD passes, and the New England Patriots beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for their seventh straight win. After Maye threw an interception in the end zone, the Patriots (8-2) made a big stop on fourth-and-three at their own 27. Henderson then sealed the win with his 69-yard TD run. The rookie finished with a career-high 147 yards rushing on 14 carries. The Buccaneers were the first team in NFL history to have each of their first four wins of the season come on a game-winning score in the final minute of regulation. They had a chance to do it again when Tykee Smith intercepted Maye’s pass from the 2 in the end zone with 5:17 left.Baltimore Ravens 27–19 Minnesota VikingsLamar Jackson completed 17 of 29 passes for 176 yards and a touchdown, and the Baltimore Ravens finished strong to secure a win over the Minnesota Vikings. Justice Hill rushed for a touchdown and Mark Andrews hauled in a touchdown pass for Baltimore (4-5), who won their third game in a row after a four-game losing streak. Derrick Henry had 20 carries for 75 yards. JJ McCarthy completed 20 of 42 passes for 248 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions for Minnesota (4-5). The Ravens outscored the Vikings 18-9 in the second half to grab the lead and secure the win. The Ravens turned three takeaways into 13 points. Meanwhile, the Vikings committed eight false-start penalties.Cleveland Browns 20–27 New York JetsNew York got touchdowns on a kickoff return and a punt return in the same game for the first time in franchise history, Breece Hall took a screen pass from Justin Fields 42 yards for the go-ahead score and the Jets held on to defeat the Cleveland Browns.Five days after tradingAll-Pro cornerback Sauce Gardner and defensive tackle Quinnen Williams, the Jets came off their bye-week break to win their second game in a row. Kene Nwangwu returned a kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown in the first quarter, and Isaiah Williams brought back a punt 74 yards for a score. Will McDonald had four sacks to tie a Jets single-game record. The result leaves both teams at 2-7 this season.New Orleans Saints 17–7 Carolina PanthersRookie Tyler Shough earned his first win as an NFL starting quarterback, throwing for 282 yards and two touchdowns as the New Orleans Saints (2-8) beat the Carolina Panthers (5-5) to snap a four-game skid. Shough connected with Chris Olave and Juwan Johnson for long touchdowns, and Alvin Kamara ran for 83 yards for the Saints. New Orleans outgained Carolina 388 yards to 175.

It is all well and good raising their game for thebiggest Champions League fixturesat St James’ Park, but if they continue to play as meekly as they did against Brentford – just as indefeat at West Hama week earlier and on a concerning number of previous occasions over recent months – those European nights will rapidly become a thing of the past.Two points above the relegation zone is no place for a club of their ambition. “It’s the wrong end of the table for us, but it’s the reality,” Eddie Howe said. That they ended this match with a numerical disadvantage after Dan Burn’s sending off was of little relevance to a defeat that they fully deserved. Harvey Barnes’s goal aside, they were utterly impotent, offering only his solitary shot on target all match.Brentford 3-1 Newcastle, Aston Villa 4-0 Bournemouth and more: Premier League clockwatch – liveRead moreTheir winless away run now stretches to ninePremier Leaguegames, dating back to April. Most worryingly, there was absolutely no sign of it ever ending here. What is this travel malady that so afflicts them when leaving the north-east?“The team has taken a few hits and I think that showed today,” Howe said. “We know we are going to get criticised, we expect that. We know it’s not good enough and I take full responsibility for that – the work to putting that right starts now.“It’s not satisfactory. We haven’t done our jobs and feel we have let everybody down. When you make mistakes it’s not intentional from anyone. All you can do is hold your hands up and say let’s fix it. That’s what we’re going to try and do.”To Liverpool, Manchester United and Aston Villa, Brentford can now add Newcastle to the list of notable clubs they have defeated at home this season. In a game only pockmarked by moments of quality, it was a victory their dominance merited.That they fell behind in the first place was something of a marvel given Newcastle’s lack of threat. Following the visitors’ only truly slick passing move, Barnes picked up the ball just inside Brentford’s penalty area and sent two defenders the wrong way with a wonderful shift of body weight that provided space to drill between Caoimhín Kelleher’s legs.As on their trip to West Ham, they were ahead. And just as occurred then, they promptly conceded three times, Kevin Schade nodding an equaliser and Igor Thiago adding a late double. Newcastle have now dropped more points from winning positions in the Premier League this season than any other side.View image in fullscreenDan Burn brings down Dango Ouattara and is sent off after receiving a second yellow card.Photograph: Adam Davy/PA“Very disappointing that we did get ourselves in a really good position again and we weren’t able to really capitalise,” said Howe. “We were lacking in confidence today. There were a lot of technical mistakes, especially in the middle of the pitch where we’re usually really fluid. That contributed to putting us under pressure. … We know we are good players and have a really good team, but we need to stay grouped together in this difficult period.”There was a sense of inevitability about the manner of Brentford’s comeback. To the hosts’ credit, they had exhibited their ball-playing prowess numerous times without any luck before equalising through a familiar set-piece route.Keith Andrews believes Michael Kayode is the best long‑throw taker he has seen, and the Italian provided the goods yet again for Schade to head home. Since the start of last season, Brentford have now scored more than double the number of Premier League goals from throw‑in situations as any other team.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That Brentford were denied a penalty when Dango Ouattara was first felled by Burn will remain a matter of some bemusement, especially after the video assistant referee suggested replays of the Newcastle defender’s studs nestling into the attacker’s ankle constituted “minimal contact”. Ouattara was even booked for diving.Quick GuidePlay our new game: On the ballShowThe Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles withthe launch of its first daily football game, On the ball.

Played in over the top, Ouattara reached the ball first, again, and was brought down by the same Newcastle player. This time, the referee delivered a different verdict: penalty and a second yellow card for Burn.Thiago duly stepped up and stroked the ball past Aaron Ramsdale, who had come off the bench to replace the concussed Nick Pope as part of a quadruple substitution after the penalty had been awarded. Howe confirmed later that Pope will not join the England squad during the international break.With Newcastle all but buried, the Brazilian striker Thiago added an eighth league goal of a brilliant personal campaign after a Malick Thiaw slide tackle diverted the ball straight into his path in injury time.“Second half we were very, very good and hit high levels in every phase of the game, with the ball, without it, the bits in between and set pieces, obviously,” Andrews said. “We were worthy of the win.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrentfordNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The left-back, who scored on his final Arsenal appearance in May, drilled in from 25 yards to double Celtic’s lead six minutes into the second half. It was the 28-year-old’s first Celtic goal since a Europa League win against RB Leipzig on 8 November 2018.Johnny Kenny had opened the scoring in the 10th minute with his fourth goal in four matches under the interim management team of Martin O’Neill and Shaun Maloney. Daizen Maeda missed several good chances forCelticand Kilmarnock hit the crossbar through Bruce Anderson before Tierney struck. The home side struggled to build on the cushion but late goals from Maeda and Arne Engels, from the spot, added a flattering sheen to the scoreline.O’Neill has stated he expects Celtic to make progress on their search for a permanent successor to Brendan Rodgers during this international break, but he remains in the dark. After the victory he said: “I should imagine at some stage or another during the course of the next week that somebody will let me know what’s happening.”When asked if he would consider an extended stay, the 73-year-old said: “I really don’t know. I was going to say, it’s a young man’s game, and I’m almost talking myself out of this here. But it’s been tough. All the things that I kind of thought I knew about it have come to sort of fruition. You know, about the strength of the side, or what I thought I saw from a distance.”Luca Stephenson equalised just before half-time asHeartswere held to a 1-1 draw at home byDundee United. The leaders, who started the day nine points clear at the top, went in front in the 25th minute when Alexandros Kyziridis’s shot rebounded from a post and ricocheted over the line off the United keeper Yevhenii Kucherenko. But Stephenson headed the visitors level, and the home side – unable to break them down after the break – were forced to settle for a second draw in three matches.View image in fullscreenDundee United’s Luca Stephenson (right) equalises against Hearts at TynecastlePhotograph: Jane Barlow/PATheHeartsmanager, Derek McInnes, said the draw felt like a defeat, although he conceded his team did not warrant anything more. “I thought we didn’t deserve any more than the point we got,” he said. “It’s difficult to be too critical of the fact that we’re 12 games in, we’ve hit 30 points already, we’re in the second week of November and we’re still unbeaten.“But there’s no doubting that we came here with high expectations to get three points and I’ve got to accept that we weren’t good enough to get the three points today.”Quick GuideSaturday roundup: VAR pain for St Mirren in Hibs defeatShowSt Mirrenmanager Stephen Robinson expressed doubts over the accuracy of VAR after seeing two more goals disallowed for offside in their 3-0 defeat byHibernian.Saints had seen two goals disallowed for  offside in their three previous Scottish Premiership matches, as well as losing two players to red cards after VAR reviews. On Saturday, marginal calls denied Marcus Fraser an early headed opener and prevented Dan Nlundulu claiming an equaliser early in the second half.Robinson said: 'We equalise, we go in front, it changes the game completely, so whether they're onside or not, you hope VAR's got it right. Which would be a surprise to be fair.'

LeadingLeicesterwith four minutes to play, news filtered through that Liverpool had conceded a 93rd-minute equaliser to share the points with Brighton in a 1-1 draw. It meant that three points would lift the Hammers off the bottom of the Women’s Super League for the first time this season.Rehanne Skinner’s and Gareth Taylor’s teams have been in lockstep and they somehow contrived to mirror each other once again. As their relegation rivals had done minutes earlier, the Hammers’ conceded in the 97th minute to burst their supporters’ bubble and drop two points in a 1-1 draw, ensuring the parity between the two continued.The two sides have been rooted to the bottom for the first seven weeks of the season, both losing all seven games, unable to find rewards despite improving performances, and their managers will be at a loss to as how their first wins of the season eluded them once again.‘We need justice’: Slegers calls for VAR in WSL after Arsenal denied by officialsRead moreWest Ham’s campaign to date has been epitomised by an inability to take their chances and lapses of concentration. Both characteristics reared their heads again on this occasion against a Leicester side that offered little going forward but managed to remain in the game until the final moments.The Hammers’ frontline has the potential to be very dangerous with the pace of Viviane Asseyi and Ffion Morgan, the instinct of Shekiera Martinez and the industry of Riko Ueki. They have, however, been plagued by a lack of clinical finishing. Chances presented themselves to all four of them throughout but it was only a scrappy finish from Martinez that put their noses in front.Danger always remains when the scoreline is that narrow and the Foxes made the hosts pay with almost the final kick of the match when the substitute Shannon O’Brien snuck in at the far post to turn in Sari Kees’s low ball.Liverpool, meanwhile, earned their first point of the season against eighth-placedBrighton.Both sides have significant injury problems, particularly in attack.The Sweden striker Beata Olsson was handed another start by Taylor after she had impressed last week, scoring her first WSL goal. For the Seagulls, meanwhile, Dario Vidosic again opted for the 20-year-old Carla Camacho to lead the line in place ofMichelle Agyemang, who is out for the season.It was arguably the best performance of Taylor’s tenure as Liverpool took the game to Brighton, getting in behind the defence consistently. Olsson’s first-half opener set them on their way. They proceeded to hit the woodwork twice – first Fuka Nagano and then Sam Kerr – while Faye Kirby had to be alert with a series of smart stops at the other end with the crossbar getting involved once again.Liverpool’s hearts were broken, however, when Rosa Kafaji broke free in the box to strike deep into injury time.View image in fullscreenRosa Kafaji scored the equaliser for Brighton in injury time to dash Liverpool’s hopes.Photograph: Steve Taylor/PPAUK/ShutterstockManchester Citywent top of the table, leapfrogging Chelsea for the first time this season thanks to a hard-working 2-1 victory overEverton.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That came at the 2020 Scottish Open, and was also a playoff victory over Fleetwood.McIlroy thanks PGA chief for Ryder Cup apology and questions LIV changesRead moreRai went into the final round with a one-shot lead over his fellow Englishman Fleetwood and Denmark’s Nicolai Højgaard. He emerged with a total of 263 after a topsy-turvy, five-under final round that included seven birdies and two bogeys.Fleetwood moved one shot clear with two holes to play after a birdie on the 16th, but Rai pulled level again on the 17th and then missed a 10-foot birdie putt to win outright on the last. That set up a playoff at Yas Links where Rai prevailed to win the title and $1.5m (£1.13m) in prize money.“Tommy is a phenomenal player and an even better person. To play with him the last two days was really special,” said Rai, the current world No 30. “You’re so focused on playing the round and staying in the zone, it’s hard to put into words at the moment how it feels. It is amazing to be stood here.”Rory McIlroy left himself just too much to do, coming up one shot short in a tie for third place with Højgaard, after a stunning 10-under final round of 62.

The looming closure comes despite an independent report that estimated the centre is saving the council more than £500,000 a year in costs that include services in mental health, youth justice and social care.Pie Factory Music in Ramsgate,Kent, is a social space for eight- to 25-year-olds that also offers services including counselling, employment advice, life skills sessions, assistance for young refugees, as well as creative and music projects.Cuts by Kent county council (KCC) to youth services last year, which led to the change of use of a nearby youth centre in Margate, have meant that Pie was the last dedicated centre in Thanet. Thanet is the local government district andis among the most deprived in the country. Last year Pie supported almost 1,000 children and young people.“When KCC cut commissioned youth services in 2024 we lost about half of our annual budget,” said Zoë Carassik, who runs Pie. “We had to make up the shortfall fundraising from trusts and foundations to keep the level of provision that we’re running here going. To be told that the building we operate from is to be sold in three months’ time is devastating.”Pie has operated out of the council-owned Ramsgate youth centre for 13 years. However, KCC, which, since May, has been led by Reform UK, intends to put the youth centre up for auction in February. Pie put forward several proposals to either rent the building or buy it outright, strongly supported, said Carassik, by KCC’s Reform UK member for Ramsgate, Terry Mole, but these were rejected. The council has offered Pie a commercial lease at market rent but, Carassik said, this is far beyond its budget.As part of its case to the council, Pie provideda reportfrom business strategy consultancyOutskirts Researchthat concluded Pie’s work generated cost savings of £580,660 to the council last year because of such things as a reduction in youth offending and the provision of mental health care. The return on investment for the taxpayer was estimated to be at least £1.2m.View image in fullscreenZoë Carassik of Pie Factory Music: ‘To be told that the building we operate from is to be sold in three months’ time is devastating.’Photograph: Polly Braden/The GuardianThe situation in Kent is part of a wider picture of cutbacks to youth services in England that began more than a decade ago. A reportreleased this year by the YMCArevealed a 73% decline in funding for youth services in England and a 6% year-on-year decline in Wales between 2010 and 2024.A growing body of work by practitioners and academics points to a need to focus funds on young people on the coast. Earlier this year, a report by Essex University’s Centre for Coastal Communities showed that young people living along the most deprived stretches of England’s coastline arethree times more likelyto have an undiagnosed mental health condition than their peers in equivalent places of deprivation inland.Sun, sea and struggle: growing up in England’s coastal towns – podcastRead moreFurther workby UCL’s Coastal Youth Life Chancesproject found thatyoung people in seaside communities were significantly affected by the limited education, employment and leisure opportunities available in such places.Tom, 16, who uses Pie’s youth centre regularly, said he didn’t know what he would do without it. “It is the place I feel safest when I’m out and about in Ramsgate. If I come here, I know that nothing’s going to go wrong. I’ve made loads of friends and it has become a comfortable place for me to be.”A KCC spokesperson said: “KCC, like other councils, has to make savings to balance the overall budget and protect services it legally has to provide. The former KCC Ramsgate youth centre building was listed as an asset of community value giving local groups the opportunity to develop proposals for the site ahead of the property being sold at auction. As part of this process we received and assessed proposals from the Pie Factory. We’ve responded, setting out a number of options, and understand Pie Factory is considering its next steps.”TheAgainst the Tideseries is a collaboration between the Guardian and the documentary photographerPolly Bradenand reports on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and WalesExplore more on these topicsYoung peopleAgainst the tideSocial exclusionKentCoastlinesPovertynewsShareReuse this content"

Poland has been hit by a wave ofarson and other sabotage attacksthat involve one-time operatives on the ground and are believed to be run by Russian intelligence operatives.Later, Rogov’s wife, Irina Rogova, was also arrested, and the couple were accused of cooperating with the FSB to inform on other Russian opposition activists.Poland has arrested numerous people on charges of preparing or carrying out sabotage on behalf of Russia over the last two years. Many are Polish, Ukrainian or Belarusian citizens believed to have been recruited via Telegram for one-time paid jobs. Rogov’s case is unusual in that he is a Russian citizen and appears to have been in direct contact with the FSB for some years.The Guardian obtained an anonymised copy of the indictment against Rogov and his wife from the Polish court. In accordance with local laws, he is referred to only as Igor R, but exiled Russian media outlets and other sources have identified the defendant as Rogov.The files suggest a long history of cooperation with the FSB. Rogov admitted to interrogators that he had been approached by the security service several years ago while still in Russia and coerced into infiltrating the local branch of an opposition movement.He said he was given a burner phone and sim cards to contact his FSB handler, and when “cooperation reached a higher level” he had in-person meetings at an unmarked apartment near the local FSB headquarters. “At that time, he also began to receive money in exchange for cooperation,” according to the indictment.Rogov told his wife he had been recruited by the FSB, according to the indictment, which quotes her as saying he “probably received money for this, because he was not working at the time but he had money”.Later, in Poland, Rogov asked his wife to help him transfer to his handlers an encrypted USB stick with reports on Russian activists and others in Poland who might be of interest to the FSB. He gave her the USB stick to take on a visit to Russia hidden in a package together with souvenirs from Poland, and an address to post it to.Details from the indictment were previously published by the Polish outlet Wirtualna Polska, which also said Rogov had been blackmailed by the FSB to cooperate when in Poland, with the threat that if he did not, his father would be conscripted to serve in the Russian army.Leonid Volkov, of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, said he could not recall ever meeting Rogov but that the case demonstrated typical methods used by the Russian authorities.“This is not surprising. The FSB has always done this, still does it and will carry on doing so: finding young people with vulnerabilities, recruiting them and then sending them into opposition organisations,” he wrote on X.Another part of the case against Rogov deals with a package that he was reported to have handled. The package contained the components of an explosive device and was addressed to Rogov, although he never received it. He said he had agreed to receive the package as a favour to a friend. A Ukrainian woman was also arrested over the package but has since been released.Since 2022, Poland has made it hard for Russians to get visas, with exceptions made only for those in extreme humanitarian need or those such as Rogov with a background in opposition movements.The first hearing in the trial of the Rogovs is due to take place on 8 December.Additional reporting by Ada PetriczkoExplore more on these topicsPolandRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Searches for those still missing had to be suspended on Sunday due to safety concerns for rescue workers.At least two deaths from Typhoon Fung-wong were recorded before landfall on Sunday. The civil defence office reported that one person drowned in Catanduanes and a woman was trapped by a collapsed home in Catbalogan City. Juniel Tagarino, a rescuer in Catbalogan City, said the body of the 64-year-old woman, who had been trying to leave, had been pulled from under debris and fallen trees.“The wind was so strong and the rain was heavy … According to her family members, she might have forgotten something and went back inside her house,” Tagarino said.Graphic showing expected track of typhoonThe biggest typhoon to threaten the Philippines in years, Fung-wong could cover two-thirds of the archipelago with a 1,118-mile-wide rain and wind band, forecasters have said. Tropical cyclones with sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h) or higher are categorised in the Philippines as a super-typhoon, a designation adopted to underscore the urgency tied to more extreme weather disturbances.Scientists have said storms are becoming more powerful due to the human-driven climate crisis. Warmer oceans allow typhoons to strengthen rapidly and a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, meaning heavier rainfall.More than 1.2 million people have been pre-emptively evacuated across the country, Rafaelito Alejandro, a civil defence deputy administrator, told a news briefing.Typhoon Fung-wong is expected to bring at least 200mm (8in) of rain to many parts of the country, according to government meteorologists. It is the 21st significant storm to hit the Philippines this year, straining disaster response efforts across the country.It blew into Dinalungan town in Aurora province on Sunday night after fierce rain and wind in north-eastern Philippine provinces all day from offshore.In Aurora province, Aries Ora, 34, a government worker, said the rain was still light as he boarded up his home in the town of Dipaculao with steel sheets and wooden boards during daylight hours before landfall, but he said he feared the dark. “What really scares us is that the expected landfall is at night,” he said. “Unlike previous typhoons, we won’t be able to clearly see the movement of the wind and what’s happening around us.”Schools and government offices have been ordered to close on Monday across Luzon, including in the capital, Manila, where nearly 300 flights have been cancelled.View image in fullscreenRescuers evacuate people in Sablayan, Occidental Mindoro province.Photograph: APGilberto Teodoro, the defence secretary, urged people in the storm’s path to obey evacuation orders, saying that to not comply was dangerous and unlawful.“We ask that people pre-emptively evacuate so that we don’t end up having to conduct rescues at the last minute, which could put the lives of police, soldiers, firefighters and coastguard personnel at risk,” he said.Earlier on Sunday, Catanduanes, a small island that the state weather service said could take a direct hit, was already being lashed by wind and rain, with storm surges sending waves hurtling over streets and flood waters rising in some areas.The Guardian view on worsening extreme weather: the injustice of the climate crisis grows ever clearer | EditorialRead moreAlejandro said: “As we speak they are feeling the impact of the typhoon, especially in Catanduanes, because the storm’s eye is closest there.”Edson Casarino, 33, who lives in the town of Virac in Catanduanes, said: “The waves started roaring around 7am. When the waves hit the seawall, it felt like the ground was shaking.”Video from officials in Catanduanes, shared by the government broadcaster, showed houses submerged up to the roofs.“The rain and wind were so strong there was nearly zero visibility,” Roberto Monterola, a disaster mitigation officer for Catanduanes, told the Associated Press by telephone.In Guinobatan, a town of about 80,000 people in Albay province, verified video showed streets transformed into raging torrents.View image in fullscreenAn area affected by Typhoon Fung-wong in Catanduanes province.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockPope Leo offered prayers for the predominantly Catholic nation. “I am close to the people of the Philippines affected by a violent typhoon. I pray for the deceased and their families, for the injured and the displaced,” he said on Sunday.Fung-Wong is expected to head north of the Philippines and reach coastal waters on Monday morning while remaining a typhoon, before heading out to sea and weakening as it reaches west Taiwan on Thursday.Agence France-Press and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsPhilippinesExtreme weatherAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

In previous years, including in 2024, workers have received a book of 50 or 100 first-class stamps, but that has quietly been switched to second class this year.The downgraded perk has caused bemusement among Royal Mail’s workers. It is the first Christmas since Royal Mail’s parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), was bought byCzech billionaireDaniel Křetínský.Seasonal stamps have been a popular feature of the service since 1966, after they were introduced underLabour postmaster general Tony Benn. This year’s edition features biblical scenes illustrated by British artist Paula Doherty, while previous versions have included illustrator Quentin Blake’s 1993 rendition ofEbenezer Scroogefrom Charles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol.View image in fullscreenThe Christmas stamp design for 2025.Photograph: Royal Mail/PAAlthough the immediate costs of the gift to the Royal Mail would be limited to some extra printing and the delivery costs, a sheet of 50 first-class stamps would nominally be worth £85 sincethe price rose to £1.70 in April– more thandouble the price in 2020. A second-class stamp costs 87p – a potentially significant saving for a business that employs 130,000 people.The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said that workers were irritated by the message the change sent.A CWU spokesperson said: “The decision to send employees second-class stamps this Christmas exemplifies the way Royal Mail has been treating its staff for a long time now. Whilst postal workers are disappointed at this latest development they will, as always continue to deliver a first-class service to customers and businesses across the UK.”The change comes asRoyal Mail cuts back second-class deliveries, after it was allowed to make changes to the universal service obligation.A Royal Mail spokesperson said: “Every Christmas, Royal Mail recognises the hard work of colleagues in a number of ways, including a frontline bonus, free stamps and a wider recognition programme, to thank them for their efforts during our busiest time of year. This year, we’ve included 50 second-class stamps to reflect recent changes to the universal service obligation and to help keep mail moving smoothly for customers throughout the festive season.”In previous years the stamps gift was usually sent at the end of November, but this year’s second-class stamps were delivered earlier than expected.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Drax, Britain’s single biggest source of carbon emissions, has receivedbillions of pounds in subsidies from burning biomass derived largely from wood.The report, byStand.earth, a Canadian environmental non-profit, claims that a subsidiary of Drax Group received hundreds of truckloads of whole logs at its biomass pellet sites throughout 2024 and into 2025, which were likely to have included trees that were hundreds of years old.The report could raise fresh questions for the owner of the North Yorkshire power plant, which has been forced in recent years to defend its sustainability claims while receiving more than £2m a day in green energy subsidies from UK bill payers.The report’s findings suggest that the power plant was burning “irreplaceable” trees even as its owners lobbied the UK government for the additional green energy subsidies,which were granted earlier this week.View image in fullscreenLogs at the Burns Lake plant. Drax has been forced to defend its sustainability claims.Photograph: Desiree Wallace/Stand.earthThe company has claimed that it sources wood only from “well‐managed, sustainable forests” to manufacture the pellets that are shipped from its sites in Canada and the US to be burned at its UK power plant.But these claims have been questioned by Britain’s energy regulator andthe Financial Conduct Authorityafter a BBC Panorama documentary in 2022 reported that Drax had cut down primary forests in Canada to turn into wood pellets.The latest investigation into the company’s green credentials, seen by the Guardian, uses official data from the government of British Columbia, along with satellite monitoring, to back claims that a Canadian subsidiary owned by Drax sourced 250-year-old trees to manufacture biomass pellets as recently as this year.‘Old-growth’ forests at riskThe report claims that the company received 90 truckloads of logs sourced from “old-growth forests” in the Skeena region of British Columbia, home to some of Canada’s largest undeveloped wilderness areas.Old-growth forests are defined by the local government as areas that include trees older than 250 years in slow-growth ecosystems, or older than 140 years in ecosystems in which trees are replaced more quickly.Drax said in October 2023 it had stopped sourcing wood from areas designated by the government of British Columbia as “protected” or “deferred” old-growth forest stands, but it did not dispute that it was still sourcing wood from other sites containing old growth.Responding to the Stand.earth report, a spokesperson for Drax said: “Our sourcing policy means Drax does not source biomass from designated areas of old growth and only sources woody biomass fromwell-managed, sustainable forests.”These designated areas of old growth amount to less than half of the total old-growth forest areas in British Columbia. Figures from the BC government show that designated areas total 5.3m hectares, while the total area of old-growth forest in the province spans 11.1m hectares. Another 3.7m hectares are protected under separate designation schemes.Stand.earth claims that in 2024 and 2025 Drax received at least an additional 425 truckloads of whole logs from “cutblocks” – areas of forest land designated for timber harvesting – which contained old-growth forests.The report claims that 63 of these loads came from three cutblocks that contained more than 90% old-growth forest, “meaning that this purchase almost certainly contained old growth”.It added that the remaining 362 lorry loads of whole logs came from 22 cutblocks in the Skeena region that were more than 80% old growth, meaning that it was “likely” they contained old growth.“The true volume of old growth sourced by Drax is likely higher than what our research was able to track, because of spatial data limitations,” the report said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With how logging works here in BC, there isn’t really a way for Drax to be operating in these areas and not include old-growth forests in their wood supply. The people of the UK should know that the risk of old-growth trees being cut down to produce wood pellets is higher than ever,” Hansen said.As part of the investigation, Hansen visited a biomass pellet production site, owned by a Canadian subsidiary of Drax, where the company’s reliance on whole logs was apparent.“It was quite stark. The yards are sprawling and there were huge piles of logs there. These were large, healthy trees of different ages. We saw some trees which had been scorched by fire, but they were still alive when they were cut, which was apparent by the oozing sap,” she said.View image in fullscreenStand.earth says that Drax received 425 truckloads of whole logs from ‘cutblocks’ that contained old-growth forests.Photograph: Desiree Wallace/Stand.earthDrax said the “low-grade” wood used to make biomass pellets had typically been rejected by commercial sawmills and either sold to the biomass industry as waste wood or burned to prevent wildfires. A spokesperson said it was “far better to use [waste wood] to generate renewable electricity rather than leaving it to burn”.The rules that allow companies in the forestry industry to disregard old growth as commercial waste are part of the problem, Hansen said.“Even exceptionally old trees can rot in the middle, which is one of their features that makes them so important for wildlife, but could mean the tree is called defective by the logging industry. This could mean that the tree is dismissed as waste wood. But a tree standing up in a forest is not waste,” she said.“Drax has come into British Columbia claiming to solve some of the problems that our forestry industry has, but they have not. It’s very disheartening, and offensive, to hear Drax claiming to be solving these problems when really they’re entrenching some of the problems that we have in forestry here,” Hansen said.Quick GuideContact Guardian Business about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The pilot scheme savedHMRC£17m but left 46% of the families targeted incorrectly suspected of fraud, a margin of error far in excess of the 1% to 5% scientifically acceptable.In Northern Ireland, 78% were incorrectly identified as not having returned from trips abroad and 129 families were flagged during the pilot as having left the countrywhen only 28 had actually done so.Kim Johnson, the Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside, called for an urgent investigation after being contacted by several constituents who had their benefits stopped.The results of the pilot raise fundamental questions about using Home Office data to infer fraud, experts have said.HMRC cuts child benefit for 23,500 families based on incomplete travel dataRead more“Relying on Home Office data for punitive purposes is always going to be problematic,” said Colin Yeo, an immigration barrister at Garden Court Chambers.The detailed background to the anti-fraud initiative is not yet known, but Yeo said it was “quite alarming” to see Home Office data used “when the data so obviously doesn’t bear the weight that they are placing on it.”The data has emerged two weeks after an investigation by the Guardian and the investigative websitethe Detailrevealed thatthousands of families had had their benefits stoppedas part of a government crackdown on benefit fraud.Cases including one woman who had her benefits stopped after booking a flight to Italy that she never boarded becauseone of her children had an epileptic seizureat the departure gate. Another told of losing benefits despite not taking a flight she had booked because a wedding she was going to attend had been cancelled.The Liberal Democrats and the Green party have raised concerns in parliament.The Lib Dem peer Tim Clement–Jones has asked the government in a written parliamentary question to explain why it had “not published the business case and data protection impact assessments”. The Green peer Natalie Bennett has asked which internal assessment of procedures had been put in place since the child benefit freezes came to light.TheGuardian and the Detail first reported last monththat hundreds of families in Northern Ireland had had their benefits stopped after they returned to the UK via Dublin airport.It then emerged that about 23,500 letters cutting child benefit had been sent to parents across the country including in Rochdale, Liverpool, London, Brighton and Glasgow.HMRC has said it will no longer use data on travel through Dublin airport to infer fraud because it is part of the common travel area, and that it not stop benefits without cross-checking with PAYE records and the person concerned first.Parents said they felt they had been treated like criminals after receiving the letters. Some said they were still arriving this week, more than a week after HMRC apologised for the distress it had caused.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Flights were disrupted at Brussels and Liège airports last Thursday after unidentified drone sightings, which were also reported at military bases and nuclear facilities in the country.Russia has been identified as the most likely culprit, the latest in a string of incidents across northernEuropethis autumn. However, Knighton said even without knowing definitively who was behind the drone flights, he was “very happy” to act in support of a Nato ally.Germany announced last week it had sent specialist assistance, and Belgian authorities said France had followed suit. The UK’s help is expected to come from the RAF’s dedicatedcounter-uncrewed aerial systems unit.Last week Boris Pistorius, the German defence minister, said he believed the drone incursions were “likely connected with the fight over the use of Russian frozen assets held by Belgium”. EU and UK politicians have been discussing how to release Russian central bank assets, held mostly in Belgium, to support a €140bn (£120bn)loan to Ukraine.Knighton was speaking in his first television interviews as chief of defence staff since he took over from Adm Sir Tony Radakin in September. A former head of the air force, he led military tributes to fallen soldiers at the Cenotaph in London on Sunday morning after the king and prime minister.Knighton said in an interview with the BBC that “Russia is the most pressing threat right now” and the UK needed to strengthen itself against “hybrid warfare, this warfare that’s below the traditional threshold”, including threats from cyber and in space, sabotage, and assassination plots on British soil.In an interview with Sky News, Knighton acknowledged that the UK armed forces had been “hollowed out” after 30 years of cuts since the end of the cold war. “We know that we have gaps in things like weapons stockpiles. We know that we don’t have all the people that we need,” he said when asked to elaborate.UK defence spending is expected to increase from £62.2bn this year to £71bn in 2027-28, in line with a plan to lift the total military budget to 2.6% of GDP during this parliament. But money has been limited because of restricted budgets in previous years, internal overspends, and a heavy focus on new equipment rather than day-to-day costs.Knighton said he was “confident the armed forces are a safe place for women” because of changes implemented after the suicide ofGnr Jaysley Beck, 19, who killed herself in 2021 after she was sexually assaulted by a senior colleague and bombarded with texts and voice messages by another line manager.At the beginning of November, Beck’s mother, Leighann McCready, said women should not join the army because they were not properly protected in a male-dominated environment. “They protect themselves and not the soldiers,” she said.Describing it as “a horrible case,” Knighton said: “I can understand why Jaysley Beck’s mother has said that. What happened to Jaysley was entirely unacceptable. It was criminal. She was let down.”He said since then the military had made changes, including introducing an independent defence serious crimes unit and a victim and witness care unit. He said victims were able to choose whether accusations of crimes such as rape and serious sexual assault were handled in the military or civilian courts.Explore more on these topicsMilitaryRoyal Air ForceBelgiumDrones (military)RussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He was followed by his son, the Prince of Wales.The king wore a field marshal uniform – the army’s highest rank – and saluted before withdrawing from the monument after a two-minute silence.The Prince of Wales, dressed in Royal Air Force uniform in the rank of wing commander, saluted after laying his wreath at the Cenotaph.The prime minister,Keir Starmer, also laid a floral tribute, along with senior politicians including Kemi Badenoch, Ed Davey, Yvette Cooper, Shabana Mahmood and Lindsay Hoyle, and representatives from the Commonwealth.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer laid a floral wreath, paying tribute to the ‘extraordinary courage’ of the UK armed forces.Photograph: Alastair Grant/ReutersStarmer said: “This Remembrance Sunday, we pause as a nation to honour all those who have served our country. We reflect on the extraordinary courage of our armed forces in the world wars and subsequent conflicts, whose service secured the freedoms we cherish today.”Reflecting on the 80th anniversary of the second world war, Starmer spoke of “a generation who stood against tyranny and shaped our future”.He added: “Such sacrifice deserves more than silence, which is why this government remains committed to supporting veterans, their families and those who serve. Today, we remember, and we renew our promise to uphold the values they fought for.”View image in fullscreenChelsea Pensioners march past the Cenotaph at the end of the Remembrance Sunday ceremony.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/ReutersThe Princess of Wales andQueen Camilla, both dressed in black, and other members of the royal family viewed the Remembrance Sunday service from a balcony at the Foreign Office overlooking the Cenotaph. The pair were joined by the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, the Duke of Kent and the Duchess of Edinburgh.Standing close to the Cenotaph were eight former prime ministers: John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak.The first minister of Scotland,John Swinney, marked the occasion in Edinburgh, laying a wreath at the Stone of Remembrance outside the City Chambers.View image in fullscreenVeterans lay wreaths at the Stone of Remembrance outside the City Chambers in Edinburgh.Photograph: Jane Barlow/PAAs well as royals and political leaders, 10,000 members of the armed forces participated in the Royal British Legion’s annual march past, including about three D-day veterans among the 20 second world war veterans marking 80 years since the conflict ended in 1945.About a dozen people wearing military uniforms and poppies were pushed in wheelchairs along Whitehall while applause rang out near the Cenotaph and one veteran saluted.Among the marchers was 101-year-old Donald Poole, a Royal Army Ordnance Corps technician who served in India in 1945 when Japan’s surrender was announced, sparking an impromptu celebration.Poole, originally from Bromley, GreaterLondon, said: “It is a great honour to be able to pay tribute to the poor souls who have died in all conflicts, and I know how lucky I am to still be here thanks to all those who have fought and served, past and present.“I also want to pay tribute to the civilian services who suffered during the second world war, particularly the fire service, who saved so many lives during the blitz – many of whom lost their own.”View image in fullscreenSecond world war veterans (from left) Mervyn Kersh, Jim Grant and Henry Rice take part in the march past at the Cenotaph.Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PAHenry Rice, a former signalman who arrived off Juno beach five days after D-day, and Mervyn Kersh, who arrived in Normandy aged 19, three days after the start of the D-day invasion, were also in attendance on Sunday.Sid Machin, one of six 101-year-olds registered to march, is one of the last surviving Chindit special forces soldiers the second world war’s Burma (now Myanmar) campaign.When he was only 19, Machin found himself behind enemy lines in a glider at night in the jungle as part of a unit that disrupted Japanese supply lines and infrastructure.As well as the Cenotaph wreath-laying ceremony, commemorations were held at war memorials in villages, towns and cities across the UK.Explore more on these topicsRemembrance DaySecond world warKing Charles IIIMilitaryMonarchyPrince WilliamCatherine, Princess of WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Lifeguards and medical staff tried to resuscitate him but he died at the scene. His identity has not been disclosed.A woman had a fatal heart attack when a giant wave swept 10 people into the sea in the northern city of Puerto de la Cruz. El Día reported that the woman was a 79-year-old Dutch citizen.Emergency services said on social media that several people fell into the water after a sudden tidal surge. An unexpectedly high wave crashed into a pier, dragging people into the ocean. Three people were seriously injured and treated in hospital.The local broadcaster La Radio Canaria shared footage on X that it saidshowed the momentthe wave swept several people from the Puerto de la Cruz pier.At least five people were injured at Roque de las Bodega beach in the north-eastern corner of the island when a strong wave towed them into the sea. El Día said all were French tourists.Emergency services had previously issued a warning for sudden sea surges and strong winds, which are common in autumn and winter, and the archipelago is on further alert for coastal hazards.The public have been urged to avoid exposed vantage points on piers and breakwaters where visitors often stop to take pictures and videos of crashing waves.Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsSpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Despite initial momentum, she felt the energy from the frontlines of the strikes had dissipated in the last year. That energy reignited when Mamdani entered the picture.How Mamdani is defying immigrant expectations by embracing his identity: ‘His boldness resonates’Read more“We felt so motivated and energized to help people in a city we don’t even live in because of the broader impact on the country,” she said.Many of the people interviewed are part of the 4,000 young members of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) Los Angeles chapter who felt inspired by Mamdani’s campaign and its national implications. Looking ahead, they want to bring the hope and lessons from field organizing back to Los Angeles.New York and Los Angeles have very different geographies and spreads of power. In Los Angeles, city council members’ elections tend to have more weight compared to a mayoral race. And given the DSA-LA chapter has endorsedfive candidatesso far in the city council and local school board elections, there are plenty of volunteer efforts for these hopefuls to work on in the coming year.View image in fullscreenLeslie Chang canvassed for Zohran Mamdani in Manhattan’s Chinatown with Katie Sims (Ithaca), Brynn Lemos (Denver), and Clayton Ryles (Los Angeles) before the Bernie Sanders, AOC and Mamdani rally on 25 October.Photograph: Leslie ChangLeslie Chang, who serves as the East San Gabriel Valley coordinator for Democratic Socialists of America, flew out during the primaries to canvass for Mamdani. She volunteered to canvass in Chinatown, where she spoke the language, and the Red Hook public housing projects.“These were tough conversations,” Chang said, noting residents felt left out in the city’s development. “They would say: look at the condition of this place that I live in. We are still waiting for repairs from the hurricane. Why should I give a shit who is running for office if my life hasn’t gotten better?”Readers on Zohran Mamdani’s victory: ‘It was a collective exhale’Read moreDuring her volunteer field training, Chang met twoNew YorkCity council members who were vouching for Mamdani’s mayoral campaign. They told Chang to give out their phone numbers to start conversations with constituents.“I thought that was really powerful, because in almost all of the canvases that I do here [in Los Angeles], there isn’t that level of engagement,” she said. After canvassing, there was even a social event for volunteers to get to know one another and discuss what strategies worked best.Paul Zappia, an animator and illustrator who also serves in DSA-LA leadership, first met the mayor-elect in 2023 at the DSA national conference in Chicago, where Mamdani served as a keynote speaker. He flew out in late October to canvass with friends in Bushwick. At the beginning of his shift, the field lead asked why each volunteer had come out.“I shared with everybody that I was here from Los Angeles because the victory ofZohran Mamdaniis bigger than New York City,” said Zappia, who attributes his involvement in politics to the 2016 Bernie Sanders campaign.View image in fullscreenPaul Zappia canvassed in the Bushwick neighborhood in late October.Photograph: Álvaro López/Paul ZappiaEven walking to lunch a few blocks away, he encountered another canvassing group. “It’s just a bunch of people who are there on their free time and want to spend a couple hours on their Saturday together with other people that also care about their fellow working class people. And it was just such a blast,” he said.The geography and public transportation layout of New York’s five boroughs makes it easier to canvas in groups. Zappia said he could feasibly knock on hundreds of doors in a one-block radius there. In Los Angeles, a street could be filled with mostly single-family homes. And with the abundance of Ring doorbell cameras, people can easily decline a visitor from the comfort of their couch.How Mamdani built an ‘unstoppable force’ that won over New YorkRead moreClayton Ryles, 31, only canvassed for one afternoon in Manhattan’s Chinatown in late October and felt the contrast between Mamdani’s campaign and others. In September last year, Ryles canvassed for Kamala Harris with his fellow United Auto Worker labor organizers in Las Vegas. Knocks on doors yielded intrepid voters who were “upset and suspicious”. Despite many people being pro-union, they felt that their cost of living was too high under Joe Biden.“Nobody was excited about the election. Everybody was like this is being inflicted upon us. We have to decide one way or another. For Zohran, most of the people were enthusiastic about what could happen with his mayoral tenure,” Ryles said.Davarpanah agreed, pointing to the call and response levels of Mamdani’s speech when crowds could clearly repeat phrases such as “fast and free buses” and “universal childcare”.“You can name them. Harris 2024 was not successful in articulating a vision,” she said. “A policy vision that materially impacts your constituents is something every candidate should take to heart. This is what actually inspires people to get involved when they actually see what you’re going to deliver.”View image in fullscreenDSA-LA members hosted a watch party for Zohran Mamdani and Prop-50 from a Downtown Los Angeles bar for the 4 November 2025 election.Photograph: Daisy Guizar/Alex BrazieAcross social media, users have been making posts about howCalifornia, and Los Angeles specifically, needs a Mamdani.For Zappia, that means bringing back hope after a tough year that started with theAltadena wildfiresand has continued withICE raids,cutbacks to Snap benefits, andrising inflation, among many other difficulties.“People are just really looking for a sort of sign that things can turn around. In order to actually affect the change that we want to see, we have to first believe that we can actually do it,” he said.“And what happened in New York City is proof that it can be done, it’s proof that organized people can beat organized money.”Explore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniLos AngelesNew YorkUS politicsDemocratsWest CoastCaliforniafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Will they succeed? | Moira DoneganRead moreThis is not the first time Trump has questioned the credibility of US elections – he did it almost as vigorously in2016and2024, when he won his bids for the White House, as he did in 2020, when he did not – but now the president’s confidants are threatening emergency powers to seize control of a process over which presidents ordinarily have no control.Trump’s former chief political adviser, Steve Bannon, is urging him to get the elections “squared away” even before the voters have a chance to weigh in. Former legal advisers have suggested the electoral system is in itself an emergency justifying extraordinary intervention, possibly including federal agents and the military stationed outside polling stations.When Bannon was asked whether voters might find this intimidating, he replied: “You’re damn right.”View image in fullscreenSteve Bannon speaks at the New York Young Republican Club’s annual gala in New York on 15 December 2024.Photograph: David Dee Delgado/ReutersThe administration itself, meanwhile, is moving on multiple fronts. Most visibly, Trump is pressuring Republican-run states to redraw their congressional maps outside the usual once-a-decade schedule and lock in as many additional safe Republican seats as possible.Texas has gerrymandered an additional five GOP seats, Ohio two, and Missouri and North Carolina one each, and other states are considering whether to follow suit. (California voters, in response,have just approveda map promising five additional Democratic seats.)Meanwhile, the justice department hasabandonedits decades-long defense of voting rights, and in some instances – notably, a pending supreme court case that riskserasinga key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act – has switched to the side arguingagainstprotecting minority rights. The Department of Homeland Security has slashed funding and cut staff at anagencydedicated to protecting elections from physical and cybersecurity threats.The administration is also demanding states hand over sensitive voter data and purge voter rolls, despite grave concerns about this deterring or disenfranchising large numbers of legitimate voters. In anexecutive orderissued in March, the White House said it wants voters to produce birth certificates or passports as proof of eligibility. It wants the vote count to be over on election night, disregarding provisional and late mail-in ballots. In fact, Trump would like to do away with mail-in balloting altogether.View image in fullscreenVoting rights activists gather outside the supreme court in Washington DC on 15 October 2025.Photograph: Cliff Owen/APIf all that doesn’t suffice – if Democrats still threaten to prevail next year – the administration has a multi-agencyinfrastructureset upto trumpet allegations of voter fraud and threaten legal action, including possible criminal prosecution of poll workers, election administrators, political adversaries and individual voters. “We’re going to come after the people … who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,” Kash Patel, now FBI director,vowedin the run-up to the 2024 race. (No court has ever substantiated Trump’s claims that Biden was not the rightful winner in 2020.) “Whether it’s criminally or civilly, we’ll figure that out.”Another possibility is that Trump will seek to wrest control of voting machines from state and local officials, as hecame close to doingfive years ago.“Those of us engaged in this fight are witnessing a wholesale attack on free and fair elections,” said Marc Elias, a prominent election lawyer involved inmore than 60election-relatedsuits. “From executive orders to budget cuts, the Trump administration is undermining election security and promoting voter disenfranchisement.”Perhaps the biggest underlying fear is that Trump has no interest in democracy and aims, ultimately, to destroy it. “I don’t think Donald Trump wants another election,” California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom,opinedas Trump invokedlegally questionableemergency powers to deploy national guard troops to US cities.Administration officials insist their concern is to prevent cheating by the Democrats and improve electoral security. But on the campaign trail last year, Trump told evangelical Christian supporters they would need to vote for himonly one more time. “Four more years, you know what, it’ll be fixed,” he said. “We’ll have it fixed so good, you’re not gonna have to vote.”Whatever the ultimate goal, the question uppermost in the minds of many voting rights advocates is how much Trump and his allies will be able to pull off over the next 12 months. The president has almost no power over elections under the constitution, and much of what the administration has advocated is being challenged in court. It is, for example, afederal crimeto deploy troops at any election site. Voter intimidation of any kind is similarlyprohibited.For that reason, advocates and lawyers say, the risk is less about what Trump is allowed to do and more about what he can persuade people to do anyway.View image in fullscreenVoters wait in line while others fill out their ballots in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 4 November 2025.Photograph: Alex Kormann/Star Tribune via AP“Donald Trump is a marketing machine, and what he is doing right now is marketing power he does not have,” said Justin Levitt, a lawyer who served as a senior adviser on voting rights in the Biden administration. He described Trump’s March executive order, with its demands for strict voter identification procedures and new voting equipment standards, as just “a piece of paper with a scrawly signature on it”. (A federal judge recentlyblocked the order, saying the president was improperly asserting powers the constitution assigned to Congress and the states.)“It’s an attempt to fool people,” Levitt added. “Trump’s primary power is the power we give him when he asserts he is in control of everything, and we believe him.”The more Trump can say that the vote count can’t be trusted, the more it serves his purposeElisabeth Frost of the Elias Law GroupJasleen Singh, a lawyer with the Brennan Center for Justice, has no doubt Trump is “directing, dismantling andweaponizingagencies” with the ultimate goal of “election subversion”. But she, too, said it was important not to give in to the force of Trump’s personality.“The law is on our side,” she said. “We have the right to vote. We have the right to participate … Part of this is not letting voters forget the power that they have.”The White House had no specific comment about Trump’s actions or intentions. Deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson limited herself to a crack about “Newscum” – Trump’s favored term of abuse for the California governor – and his “doomed-to-fail” (but unannounced) presidential campaign.Resisting Trump’s pull is proving easier said than done. On a variety of seemingly settled issues – from district maps to the grace period granted for postal ballots to reach their destination – Republican state legislatures have either reversed their own decisions or are considering doing so because of instructions from the White House. “States are under enormous pressure to do what they can to pacify this incredibly vindictive administration,” said Elisabeth Frost, a partner with Elias’s election law group.Election administrators have expressed widespread fears of doxing and physical threats, and many hundreds havequit their jobsunder the pressure. The Maga movement hasencouragedsupporters to run for election offices to influence the process from the inside.In a worst-case scenario, voting rights activists say, Trump would win the rhetorical battle and convince large numbers of Americans that voter rolls are corrupted and ineligible voters are casting ballots in large numbers. He could thus muster support for the emergency intervention his allies are pushing for.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The justice department sent federal monitors to California and New Jersey, which some local officials saw as intimidation. Trump called the California ballot initiative a“giant scam”. And New Jersey’s US attorney, Alina Habba, put out avideovowing to prosecute a long list of virtually nonexistent election-related crimes.View image in fullscreenAlina Habba speaks in Washington DC on 25 February 2025.Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPAExperts still said they thought that invoking a national emergency remained a remote possibility. More likely, they said, was a continuation of the pressure campaign to suppress votes and cast doubt on results Trump does not like. They expected the administration to continue to push legal limits first and deal with any blowback from the courts after.“Everyone is seeing the polls,” Frost, the Elias Law Group lawyer, said. “Literally none of their policies are popular, so they are terrified of this election. The more Trump can say that the vote count can’t be trusted, the more it serves his purpose … Either voters will be repressed by laws or they will be repressed by misinformation and made-up bombastic nonsense.”Marpheen Chann, a Cambodian American advocate in Maine, has seen first-hand how pressure from theTrump administration– and, in particular, demands for sensitive personal data in the state’s voting records – has deterred community members from participating next November.“Personally, I’m concerned because I’m politically active. I’m a Democrat,” Chann said. “Will I end up on a list?”What is true for him, a community leader with a law degree, runs even deeper through the membership of his organization, Khmer Maine. Many either experienced the 1970s Cambodian genocide first-hand or have been traumatized by it across generations, making them particularly sensitive to any hint of authoritarian behavior. “The fact that the federal government is trying to break into our voting data and violate our privacy definitely does not feel good for the community,” Chann said.Top of mind is the fear that immigration enforcement agents might seek to use inconsistencies in the data – a missing birth certificate, or a mismatch between a birth name and a name on a passport, both of which are issues for Chann – as a pretext to pursue even naturalized citizens for arrest and deportation. Regardless of how justified those fears are, Chann said they are vivid enough to scare people away from civic engagement. “It makes it really hard for me to get people participating and making their voices heard,” he said. “If they make their voices heard, they feel they’re going to be targeted.”In some parts of the country, Republican state legislatures have needed no pressure from the administration tosuppress votes– they have been tightening voter ID requirements, cutting early voting hours, restricting voter registration drives and reducing the number of polling stations for the past 20 years. In other places, though, they have done Trump’s bidding even though it offers them little or no partisan advantage.Kansans, for example, recently voted to get rid of a three-day window for mail-in ballots to be counted after election day, even though the mail is notoriously slow there and mail-in voting is popular in rural areas, where voters tend to be conservative.Frost, who is part of a lawsuit to reinstate the three-day window, agreed that Trump’s personal animus against mail-in voting was not necessarily aligned with Republican partisan interests. Still, she saw a political advantage for Trump in demonizing parts of the electoral system.“The same way he’s been painting the Oval Office with gaudy gold adornments,” Frost said, “he’s been trying to pre-paint all these conspiracy theories so if the election doesn’t go the way he wants, he and his allies can point to the sea of litigation they’ve triggered, or they can point back to the March executive order, and say these were things that should have been done to begin with.”To counter the chaos and the conspiracies, voting rights groups have most often turned to lawsuits and have been heartened to see lower courts, at least, blocking crucial parts of the Trump agenda. Increasingly, they have also seen judgesreprimandpolitical appointees arguing on behalf of the justice department following a wave of career lawyers being fired or resigning.“The quality of lawyering they are doing now is, in a word, garbage,” Levitt, the former Biden official, said. “You’re going to see the [justice department] lose a lot of cases, and these are cases they should lose.”View image in fullscreenA poll worker holds ‘I Voted’ stickers in Brooklyn, New York, on 4 November 2025.Photograph: Michael M Santiago/Getty ImagesIn the voter data lawsuits, for example, government filings have repeated far-right talking points – and the language of Trump’s executive order – about voter rolls being vulnerable to “illegal voting, discrimination, fraud, and other forms of malfeasance and error”. That assertion flies in the face of mainstream researchgoing back decadesthat shows it is passingly rare for ineligible voters to cast a ballot.“This tells you a lot about what the [justice department] is willing to endorse,” Frost said. “There are not going to be arguments too wild as we get deeper into the election cycle and we start to see other conspiracy theories float to the top.”Chann, the Cambodian American advocate, worried that facts and the law would not be enough to protect voting rights, especially in immigrant communities. “Even though people I trust in local and state government are saying they’re doing what they can,” he said, “that doesn’t give me any consolation when it comes to whether the federal government will obey its own election and voting laws.”Still, Chann acknowledged that legal avenues were the best hope for holding on to democracy, and he did not hesitate in coming forward as anamed defendantseeking to keep the federal government at bay in a lawsuit over Maine’s voter data.“Congress isn’t going to do anything, and the executive branch is overreaching,” he said. “We need to make our last stand in the courts.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, haswarnedthat flight reductions could reach 20% if the shutdown persists, and on Sunday he predicted a “substantial” number of people in the US would be unable to celebrate the upcoming holidays with their families if the shutdown wasn’t resolved.“You’re going to see air travel be reduced to a trickle,” Duffy said Sunday on CNN’s State of the Union. “We have a number of people who want to get home for the holidays. They want to see their family … Listen, many of them are not going to be able to get on an airplane because there are not going to be that many flights that fly if this thing doesn’t open back up.”Nearly 1,500 flights canceled on second day of cuts tied to government shutdownRead moreThe FAA’s requirement for airlines to cut 4% of daily flights at 40 “high-traffic” US airports began on Friday and represented an attempt to ease the mounting pressure on air traffic controllers. Like other federal employees, those controllers have not been paid for weeks amid the government shutdown, which has become thelongest in historyand reached its 40th day.“We are seeing signs of stress in the system, so we are proactively reducing the number of flights to make sure the American people continue to fly safely,” the FAA administrator, Bryan Bedford,saidearlier this week. He alsosaidthat between 20% to 40% of controllers had not been showing up for work over the last several days.The first round of flight reductions led to around 800 cancellations on Friday and 1,460 on Saturday. As of 9am ET on Sunday, more than 1,000 flights across the US had been cancelled for the day, according to the flight tracking websiteFlightAware.On Sunday, Duffy told CNN that the US is “short air traffic controllers” and that he was “trying to get more air traffic controllers into the towers and be certified, but I am about a 1,000 to 2,000 controllers short”.Airlines were offering full refunds to customers for canceled flights.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association has warned that the shutdown was worsening thestaffingshortagesandsaid that many controllers “are working 10-hour days and six-day workweeks due to the ongoing staffing shortage, all without pay.“This situation creates substantial distractions for individuals who are already engaged in extremely stressful work,” they said. “The financial and mental strain increases risks within the National Airspace System, making it less safe with each passing day of the shutdown.”On Saturday, the union said it had delivered 1,600 handwritten letters from members to Congress calling for the shutdown to end.As the shutdown drags on, Democratic and Republican lawmakerscontinued to blame each other for the impasse– and for the flight disruptions.On Friday, the White HouseblamedDemocrats for the cancellations and delays, saying they “are inflicting their man-made catastrophe on Americans just trying to make life-saving medical trips or get home for Thanksgiving”.On Saturday, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat,accusedthe Republicans of “playing games” andsaid: “Instead of negotiating with Democrats, Republicans would rather let air-traffic controllers go unpaid, they’d rather ground flights, and they’d rather punish travelers.”Passengers start to feel bite of flight cuts amid US government shutdownRead moreFor passengers, uncertainty remained about which flights would be canceled, and analysts warned that the disruption would likely intensify and spread beyond air travel if cancellations keep growing and reach into Thanksgiving week.The moderator of NBC’s Meet the Press, Kristen Welker, asked the Democratic US House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, if the shutdown would end before Thanksgiving. “I hope so,” Jeffries said.Asked the same question by Welker, Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma said “it absolutely needs to – it needs to open today if we can get it open”.Rental car companies reported a sharp increase in one-way reservations Friday, and some people simply canceled flights altogether.Some analysts have pointed out that there was the potential for higher prices in stores, as nearly half of US air freight is shipped in the bellies of passenger aircraft. There is also the possibility of higher shipping costs that get passed on to consumers, and further losses, from tourism to manufacturing, that will ripple through the economy if the slowdown continues.The Associated Press and Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025US politicsUS federal government shutdownsAir transportTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The investor followed that up in 2024 with about £85m out of a £125m debt package. Carlyle’s total financing to the business is thought to be more than £500m.Abu Dhabi-based investment fund International Media Investments (IMI), which also lent to Very, is expected to remain a lender.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The White House often seems to believe two opposing policies can work together while one policy can do two or three contradictory things.A heavy dose of hocus pocus will be needed to make the administration’s dollar policy work in the interest of the United States, for it appears that they want to end the US dollar’s supremacy in global finance.At least some part of it does. True,Donald Trumphas warned countries not to replace the dollar,or else. And, reportedly, some members of the administration want to encourage more countries toadopt the dollaroutright. But what is also true is thatStephen Miran, the president’s chief economic adviser, on leave to act as board member of the Federal Reserve, thinks the dollar’s position as the main reserve currency of the world is an undue burden for the US and a principal driver of the large trade deficit that Trump findsso odious.“America runs large current account deficits not because it imports too much,” Miranwrote last year. Rather, it imports too much because it must export Treasury bonds to provide other countries with assets in which to park their reserves. This leads to “persistent dollar overvaluation that prevents the balancing of international trade.”The quote brings to mind Jenny Holzer’s 1980s Times Square billboard, with its dry appeal to a higher power: “protect me from what I want.”It is not impossible that Trump & Co. could effectively debase the dollar. They could do it through policy choice or sheer incompetence. Arguably, they have already started. They will not like the outcome.For sure, foreign countries will suffer if US Treasury bonds quit their job as safe liquid assets in which to park reserves. There are no good alternatives out there. The old hope that the euro would rival the dollar has been stymied by Europe’s fragmented capital markets. A quarter century from the euro’s launch there is no euro T-bond. The renminbi, meanwhile, can’t play a leading role in global finance while China retains capital controls that keep money from freely flowing in and out.The dollar is valuable not only as a financial haven. A recentresearch paperpoints out that roughly two thirds of countries in the world stabilize their currency against the dollar to provide insurance against global economic shocks. Because the US market is so large, the value of the dollar affects the price of traded goods: shocks that appreciate the dollar also raise their price. Holding dollars or, indeed, aligning one’s currency with the dollar – can help hedge against these economic fluctuations.The cost of undermining the dollar to the US would also be enormous. For starters, it stands to lose world influence, alongside its main tool for economic coercion, which allows it to limit enemies’ access to the financial system. Moreover, the US would relinquish what former French president Valery Giscard d’Estaing called the US’s “exorbitant privilege”.Miran is not wrong that the dollar’s reserve status draws a lot of money into Treasury bonds. But that is a gift. It allows the government to fund itsmassive debt– 120% of GDP – at a low interest rate. The privilege also implies that the USearns moreon its holdings of foreign assets than foreigners earn on their US holdings. Indeed, curbing the US current account deficit would be much more difficult if the US lost its reserve status because its interest rate edge would shrink or disappear altogether.Which brings us to the question, will Trump knock the dollar off its perch? Its supremacy has been eroding. These days it accounts for 58% of global foreign exchange reserves, down from 74% at the turn of the century. The interest rate advantage Treasury bonds have over the debt ofcorporationsorother countrieshas shrunk over time.And Trump’s trade war will reduce the dollar’s insurance powers. By curbing US imports, Trump’s tariff wall will dampen the relationship between the dollar and the price of traded goods–reducing its value as a hedge against economic shocks. “We’re basically reducing the impact that we have on the world market, and by reducing the impact that we have on the world market, we also reduce the dollar safety property,”notes Tarek Hassanof Boston University.And that gives countries and investors less of a reason to peg their currency to the greenback or hold dollar assets. Hassan estimates that the tariffs imposed so far have raised US interest rates by half a percentage point, a not-irrelevant amount given that rates are in the 3-4% range. Developing countries have beenswapping out of dollar debtin recent months, turning to currencies with lower interest rates like the Swiss franc and the renminbi.The notion that the president’s trade war might undermine the dollar’s pre-eminence struck hard on“Liberation Day”in April when Trump first announced his round-robin “reciprocal” tariffs. US stocks, bonds and the dollar plunged in unison, like risky emerging market assets, breaking the ironclad rule of modern finance that shocks to the system, whether coming from the US or some faraway developing country, benefit Treasury bonds and the dollar as the world’s safe haven, where governments, investors and regular people park money in times of unrest.Markets have calmed down since then. Investors appear to have forgiven Trump for theincoherent policymaking. Maybe it’s because Trump ultimately walked back many of the tariffs. But blood is in the water. The odds that the Treasury bond will lose its primacy as the world’s safest asset are looking shorter.Who knows what that would entail? Other currencies might fill some of the slack. Europe’s joint effort to rearm, for instance, could open an opportunity for euro-wide bonds to rival US Treasury bonds in other countries’ foreign exchange reserves. But insurance against economic and financial shocks will likely become more expensive. Global welfare will surely suffer.Trump & Co might at first applaud a cheaper dollar, which would likely translate into a smaller US trade deficit. The cheers, however, are unlikely to last. This would come, for the US, at an exorbitant cost.Explore more on these topicsUS economyEconomicsDonald TrumpDollarEuroCurrenciesTrump administrationanalysisShareReuse this content"

The Argonauts author turns her lens on poetry, pop and patriarchyArifa AkbarSun 9 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTShareMaggie Nelson is an unapologetic Taylor Swift fan. She knows the discography, drops song lyrics into conversation and tells me she took her family to the Vancouver leg of the Eras tour. So she’s a dyed-in-the-wool Swiftie? Nelson seems not entirely comfortable with the breathless connotations of that term but yes, the love is real. So much so, she has written a book about the billionaire singer-songwriter, or rather, a joint analysis of Swift andSylvia Plath, who recurs in much of Nelson’s oeuvre.The notion of uniting these two cultural titans, who are seemingly poles apart in sensibility – one a melancholic American poet, the other an all-American poster girl – came to her when she heard Swift’s 2024 album,The Tortured Poets Department. Alongside its literary references to F Scott Fitzgerald, Dylan Thomas and Shakespeare, there are heavy resonances of Plath in its introspection and emotional tumult. But the book only started to take shape after a chat with her 13-year-old son’s friend, Alba. “We were making bracelets and she said ‘Have you ever heard of Sylvia Plath?’ I thought that was funny because I’d written my undergraduate thesis on Plath and I was [almost] 40 years older than her. So I said: ‘Ihaveheard of Sylvia Plath.’ As I sat there, I thought, these kids don’t want to hear me talk on this topic but I have a lot to say because I’ve been thinking of it all.”From that clarifying moment came The Slicks, a book-sized extended essay that is, sweetly, dedicated to Alba. Nelson has written about pop musicians before: there were reflections on Prince and Björk inLike Love. Here she makes a case for Swift as poet as well as lyricist. “She has songwriting moving through her,” she says, referring to the star’s hydrant gush of productivity. “Like Plath said, the blood jet is poetry, there’s no stopping it.”Nelson makes work from the blood jet too. She was a poet before she took to nonfiction and turned it into her own idiosyncratic brand of formally experimental art, sometimes written in what appears like hybrid verse-prose. She has gathered an enormous fan following with books such asBluets, a mournful paean to the colour blue, and her memoir,The Argonauts, about mothering, family and queerness.View image in fullscreenFan-girling … Maggie Nelson.Photograph: Bridgeman ImagesNow, it’s Nelson doing the fan-girling. Sitting backstage at the Edinburgh international book festival at the end of August, she has a scrubbed-faced informality and ease about her. What is it about Swift that appeals to children and celebrated writers alike? “I think one of the most beautiful things about theTaylor Swiftphenomenon has been the celebration of her creativity and her power … She’s modelling for these people (a lot of girls, but not all girls) a form of fame, being proud of yourself and proud of what you’ve done.”Fame, and its relationship to women, is the nub of the book. Those who want it with a clench-jawed desperation but never get it (Plath killed herself, never knowing how famous she would become), those who have it in dazzling abundance (Swift), and those who abjure it entirely (the reclusive poet Emily Dickinson).Neither Plath nor Swift hid their ambitions; both aimed for stratospheric fame. The shadow of a third, unnamed, ambitious woman looms over The Slicks, that ofKamala Harriswho, according to Nelson, takes a more covert tack. “I was writing the essay the entire way up to the election [which Harris lost] and there was almost a heart-in-your-throat kind of way of writing through it. A lot of people made this point about Harris – that she didn’t ever say ‘I want it’. It was given to her by [Joe] Biden standing down. There was something about that which obviated the entire problem of ‘I want this big thing’. I thought that was fascinating. I heard some people saying ‘Well, that’ll give her a better chance because if she actually wanted it, people would hate her for it.’”So the book aims an arrow against the deep-seated cultural belief that flagrantly announced female ambition – and expression – warrants punishment. This is where Swift’s brazen wanting it, and getting it, comes in. Her productivity and profile is analysed by way of ancient Greece as well as Freud’s theories on the female “hysteric”. This history is underpinned by the misogynistic assumption that women who excavate their personal lives for their art are somehow cheapening themselves. Shutting these loud women up is a part of the patriarchal project, suggests Nelson, even now. “There’s something about wanting, and naming your want – which I think both Plath and Swift did – that is still generally a punishing sphere for a woman.”It is not so dissimilar to the judgments that sometimes orbit Nelson’s intimate, boundary-blurring nonfiction, or more generally memoirs written by female writers. “It would not be a hot take to say in the field of autobiography, women have a different time of it,” Nelson says. “We’re somehow considered ethical guardians for our children, our parents, for people that we know. The idea of making revelations for the sake of art is much more ethically freighted because women aren’t supposed to take those kinds of liberties without deeply considering every other factor of how everything they do might affect somebody else.”I came up in the queer and punk world – I’m interested in who gets to be a part of the mainstreamThe Slicks sits adjacent to another book Nelson published this year,Pathemata: Or, the Story of My Mouth. Its title (taken from the Greek for “suffering”), she points out, carries distant echoes of Plath’s words: “I don’t want to mouth other people, I want other people to mouth me.” The mouth being peered into here, though, is Nelson’s own. It is memoir mixed with dreamscapes: Nelson’s own chronic and inexplicable pain in the jaw but also the broader failings of healthcare, and maybe even the collective pain of the Covid pandemic.Her creativity felt crushed by the experience of lockdown, she feared she would never write again, so the book was conceived inadvertently, as a playful diversion from the blank page: “I thought I would mess around with ugly content that I would never publish.”Some of its source material came from a pain diary she had kept for over a decade: a log of her innumerable doctors’ visits, medications and therapies alongside their outcomes – hope raised and dashed, all codified on her desktop. She had also started writing down her dreams, and those two files collided to form the premise of Pathemata. “I thought these documents would be hilarious to marry. So I began amusing myself with a pastiche project … A lot of people who have read it have said ‘I was so mad on the diseased speaker’s behalf.’ But I was very aware of a certain genre of diagnosis and complaint. I was trying to think ‘What’s the next station past that where I could arrive?’”It may not be laugh-out-loud funny, but there is awkward humour and a quietly incendiary absurdism to the probes and promises made by dentists, doctors, alternative therapists and “gurus”. “Maybe because I live in California I’m more tolerant … I think a lot of these people truly believe they’re trying to help. To me, there’s more pathos in them thinking they could help. And for anybody in chronic pain there’s a kind of shame spiral where you want to be the patient who comes back in three weeks and says ‘I did all that and I feel so much better and you’re great’. When you feel yourself drifting into the category of unhelpable, that’s a very sad space for both [patient and doctor].”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

She references Plath “burning away all the peripherals” in her pithiness, leaving no unnecessary word on the page; Nelson could be seen to be striving for that same elemental reduction. Yet paradoxically, she remembers “copious speaking” as an unstoppably talkative child. How has she become so spare on paper? Through “tonnes” of editing, she says. “I began as a poet where you do long sessions of outpourings and then you literally carve … You’re hacking off to get it into a form, so I probably do something similar. I was making this book [Pathemata] so small I kept telling myself ‘Don’t whittle it away to nothing.’”So she really is burning away all the peripheries? “Yeah, I think so. Although in The Slicks I defend Taylor Swift’s excess.” We’re back to the singer, who in some ways presents her own paradox in Nelson’s literary life. As a spangly all-American starlet, along with her famed business acumen and lean-in feminism, she is a creature of the mainstream, while Nelson resides in a far more leftfield space. That, she says, is exactly the appeal: “Part of the joy is to be brought to something that, compared to the world I came up in, which was more queer and punk, is very norm-core … Insisting on being there for it is a way of continuing to insist you are part of this culture.”The example she gives is of the Super Bowl, now synonymous with Swift and her footballer fiance, Travis Kelce, but also the heartland of popular American culture. “I like football so I was watching it but there were these anti-trans commercials that Trump was running. We were having a party to watch the game and it was signalling that ‘this isn’t for you’. I’m interested in who gets to be a part of this mainstream. I’m not willing to give that up.”Living amid Trumpian politics and the contested ground of trans identity within her family – she lives in California with a son and a gender nonconforming partner, the artist Harry Dodge – must carry its own dissonance? “It’s not terrible for my family right now, but it is shifting sands every day in which vulnerable bodies are going to be brutalised,” she says, building to a politely voiced outrage. “I care a lot about freedom. I’m not going to be lectured about it by people intent on taking it away. I wrote a book about it [On Freedom], about the two biggest discourses in the States: one about the abolition of slavery/civil rights, and the other one from white supremacists. They’ve always been present in the States.”Is America currently dealing with white supremacy? “Do you mean Trump? Sure. It’s very obvious what we’re in here.” Perhaps the capacity for joy that Nelson describes Swift as channelling in her music is a necessary light to fend off this darkness. To that end, will Nelson go to aLife of a Showgirlconcert? It will depend on whether her son is still a Swift fan, she says, but also if she can justify the cost of the tickets. Last year, she did a direct trade-off against a book licence she sold, for Bluets, which was adapted into a play in London. “I had wanted to take my son and his friend to the Eras tour but it was too expensive. I was on the fence about licensing the play, but then I realised it was about the same cost to take everyone to the tour. In Taylor Swift’s spirit, I thought I’ll sell it and go to the show.”So, she laughs, if that happens again, she’ll be there for Showgirl. Swiftonomics indeed.Pathemata: Or, the Story of My Mouth by Maggie Nelson is published by Fern (£12.99). The Slicks will be published on 13 November (Fern).

It is refreshing subject matter, enacted on wheels, as a road trip that Winston (Jason Thorpe) railroads Joy (also Farino) into taking, after refitting a school bus as a camper van.Joy is a reluctant passenger, Winston a Tiggerish life coach and overbearing parent who sells the trip to her as an odyssey of discovery after tracing the family tree to County Mayo. Both are in fact seeking escape, she from her depression in the aftermath of her first big break-up, he from a legal case which involves a dead client whose grieving family hold him responsible.It is a potently confined space that enacts the Freudian drama of blame, guilt and parental harm. This rises out of the barbed exchanges on the bus and the flashbacks to the legal case in which Winston is himself receiving coaching, of sorts, by solicitor, Claire (Shona Babayemi). A third narrative prong takes us into Joy’s dream-world which is lyrical, wintry and full of ellipses.There is bristling banter and a great recurring joke about Bono between father and daughter but little else that is warm and fuzzy in their dynamic. He dominates, she acquiesces. A crash blows the roof off their bus and their relationship but before this culminating fight, there are layers of repressed or half-spoken feelings, delicately captured in the dialogue, and a surprisingly moving sing-along.It builds unequally in its three parts, gaining traction in the legal case and road-trip. The liminal aspect of Joy’s interiority has a lovely, dream-like pull but feels slightly as if it is a different play. There are other unfinished elements: Claire’s story is under-explained and reflections on Joy’s heartbreak, which is mentioned again and again, are frustratingly few.But there is deft direction from Tessa Walker and such fine performances that it becomes a pleasure to watch in its disparate parts. There is some thrilling writing here as well, both in the dialogue and Joy’s ruminative monologues. Debbie Duru’s set design brings visual poetry; the bus is just seats on wheels, its effects created by flurries of snow, light, shadow (lighting design by Christopher Nairne) and movement (by Rebecca Wield).The originality of the staging, the invigorating writing and even the oddness of the structure makes this a wonky gem of a first play.At Hampstead theatre, London, until 29 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreHampstead theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

None were what you’d call standard repertoire, and each posed different challenges, yet somehow this multifaceted concert added up to more than the sum of its parts.Samuel Coleridge-Taylor’s Symphonic Variations on an African Air is one of his most warmly appealing works, rooted in 19th-century Romanticism while paying homage to his paternal ancestry. Over 20 minutes, he puts the agreeably malleable spiritual, I’m Troubled in Mind, through its paces, from solemn dirge for the enslaved to cymbal-crashing Edwardian paean. Oramo’s flexible beat saved the work from ever getting bogged down, allowing the music room to breathe while avoiding potential longueurs. This was plain-speaking, big-hearted fare, full of luscious countermelodies, which the orchestra pulled off with appropriate swagger.Thomas Adès’s Violin Concerto “Concentric Paths” seems almost part of the canon these days, a testament to the violinists who have taken it up over the last 20 years. Christian Tetzlaff proved well suited to its technical demands, his laser-focus and white-hot tone capable of cresting the heaviest orchestral swell. His performance here was blisteringly virtuosic, especially in the daredevil upper register where he positively thrives. Contrariwise, the slow movement saw him hovering in the air for a moment of radiant stillness, before cutting a dash in the jaunty, syncopated finale.Sibelius’s Lemminkäinen Suite is a bit of a sleeper in the concert hall, despite the popularity of its second movement, The Swan of Tuonela. Oramo, the composer’s compatriot, took evident delight in revealing the pleasures to be found elsewhere, as in Lemminkäinen and the Maidens of the Island, with its earthy dances and priapic orchestral crescendos. The Swan worked its usual misty magic, cor anglais and cello particularly eloquent, while shuddering strings and sinister Wagnerian chorales conjured up the gloomy mysteries of the Finnish underworld. The finale, in which the resurrected hero gallops home in triumph, found conductor and orchestra basking in some of the composer’s sunniest music.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicBarbicanBBC Symphony OrchestrareviewsShareReuse this content"

Now, this one-off 23,500-capacity show ahead of next year’s arena tour finds the 54-year-old northerner performing with a rocket-boosted confidence reminiscent of his 90s days in the Verve.Back then, the music press dubbed the singer “Mad Richard” for his messianic belief in music and eye-rocketing suggestion that on a good night he could fly. Thirty years later, his arsenal of moves – raining air punches on imaginary foes and so on – would alert the emergency services in any other environment. But on stage, they are ridiculously compelling.Although the opening songs are hampered by muddy sound, the perma-sunglassed singer performs as almost physically trying to transport himself and audience to a higher plane. “Who wants to go up again?” he yells, adding an extra chorus to Music Is Power. A strings section and backing vocalists turn the relatively unloved C’Mon People (We’re Making It Now) into an uplifting epic.Ashcroft is self-aware enough to caution about an approaching “slow one from the new album” and he describes Oh L’Amour as “my Charles Aznavour moment”, but croons it beautifully. His solo career has certainly had its wobbles but was built on the foundations of the Verve-era ballads that come from a deeper place than most pop. The rarely played History from 1995 is raw and wounded. The Drugs Don’t Work – generally believed to be about his father’s death – visibly moves the audience. Sonnet and Lucky Man receive such applause that the singer yells “I wish the music teacher that said I was a ‘cancer in the class’ was here to see this now”.Bitter Sweet Symphony may be 28 years old but lines such as “you’re a slave to money then you die” still clearly speak to modern Britain. A stellar nine-minute rendition sees the singer theatrically fall to his knees to illustrate the words and unleashes a vast, cathartic sing-along, with scenes resembling a gigantic Last Night of the Proms.Richard Ashcroft plays Utilita Arena, Cardiff on March 24, then toursExplore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockRichard AshcroftThe Vervelive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

The towers soared over a golden field, as if dropped into Andrew Wyeth’s bucolic painting Christina’s World. Denes’s Wheatfield: A Confrontationwas a challenge to what she called a “powerful paradox”: the absurdity of hunger in a wealthy world.The global population in 1982 was 4.6 billion. By 2050, it will be more than double that, and the prospect of feeding everyone looks uncertain. Food insecurity already affects2.3 billion people. Covid-19 and extreme weather have revealed the fragility of the food system. Denes was called a prophet for drawing attention to ecological breakdown decades before widespread public awareness. But perhaps she was prophetic, too, in foreseeing how we would feed ourselves. By 2050,more than two-thirdsof us will live in cities. Could urban farming feed 10 billion?Urban agriculture (UA) covers everything from hi-tech approaches such as vertical farming and soil-free processes such as hydroponics, aeroponics and aquaponics, to guerrilla gardening on the urban fringe. It’s not a new idea: victory gardens supplemented rationing during both world wars. In the 1970s and 80s, the “green guerrilla” movement farmed hundreds of vacant lots across Manhattan. In the 1990s, the UN recognised urban agriculture as crucial to development. During the Syrian civil war, citizens of besieged eastern Ghouta farmed mushrooms in their basements.The pandemic spurred a brief urban farming boom, with£4.5bn investedin vertical farming startups in 2021. Many folded as the world emerged from lockdown, suggesting the UA bubble had burst. But like the most tenacious plants, this idea won’t go away. In January, the Scottish government opened a new £1.8mVertical Farming Innovation Centre. Farms have sprouted in Brooklyn shipping containers, subterranean car parks in Paris, second world war bomb shelters beneath London and on rooftops from Hong Kong to Singapore. Already, UA producesbetween 5% and 10%of the world’s legumes, vegetables and tubers.Farming the city would improve diets in the global north and provide the Gglobal south with more calories. One2025 studysuggests that UA could help meet the UN’s 2030 sustainable development goals on hunger, sustainable cities and responsible consumption. It would also cut vulnerable supply chains and the carbon associated with transportation and packaging to keep food fresh. A 2013 study found that a kilo of food grown in London produced on average2.23kg less CO2than conventional agriculture.Growing is a deeply human thing to do … becoming producers as well as consumers would empower communities and enrich individualsSoil-free growing eases pressure on stressed soils and overburdened waterways. The World Economic Forum estimates that vertical farming uses up to98% less waterthan regular farming. Rainwater can be harvested from rooftops and urban wastewater recycled, even human waste-filled “black water”, if treated to remove harmful bacteria, due to its nitrogen and phosphorus content. As these are closed loop systems, no pollution makes its way into rivers.Green rooftops would cool buildings, reducing the urban heat island effect. Moreover, food sovereignty releases people from dependence on industrial agriculture, especially in under-resourced areas. Growing is a deeply human thing to do. Becoming producers as well as consumers would empower communities and enrich individuals.Before the picture becomes too utopian, it’s important to recognise that UA is not a straightforward solution. Open-air farming near roads can draw pollutants into the food chain, whereas indoor growing is highly energy-intensive. A vertical farm occupying a 30-storey building with a 5 acre (2 hectare) footprint could produce ayield equivalent to 2,400 acres(971 hectares), year-round, regardless of climate or weather, but the energy needs, scaled up to planetary levels, are unsustainable.A patchwork approach would be best. Energy-intensive, hydroponic indoor farms suit the Gulf states, where85% of foodis imported, and where there is limited fresh water but access to abundant renewable energy. Elsewhere, low-impact farming of the urban fringe, while less productive, would be more suitable. As reported in this paper, “nature connectedness” – a measure of the closeness of an individual’s relationship with other species and the wild world – hasdeclined by 60% since 1800. A holistic approach to growing known as agroecology could help here. Defined by principles rather than practices – including being responsive to the local environment; building healthy soils; protecting biodiversity; and minimising external inputs – it could transform street corners and waste grounds into bread baskets.In Edinburgh, not a mile from my house,Lauriston Farmis an agroecology cooperative converting 100 acres (40 hectares) of former sheep pasture on the edge of the city into a dynamic mix of market garden, community allotments, agroforestry (where crops are planted alongside trees to improve soils and yields) and orchards, as well as restored wetland and meadow. Like Denes’s Wheatfield, crops grow in sight of tall buildings (flats rather than skyscrapers). It’s one of the most quietly radical spaces in the city.Should we treat environmental crime more like murder?Read moreLauriston Farm can’t feed the city, but small acts combined can achieve remarkably big results. Globally, small farmers producebetween a third and a halfof the world’s calories, without recourse to the damaging, yield-boosting practices of industrialised agriculture. Agroecology could alter not just where our food comes from, but our relationship with the natural world. Its principles should be integrated into municipal and economic planning, changing how the city looks, and mixing green and gold among the grey. But gaps in national and local policy make this difficult. Edge lands should be mapped and disused land made available, along with investment and training, to help communities start growing.UA alone won’t feed 10 billion people. But neither can we afford to ignore it. We need to prevent food wastage, preserve soils, halt pollution, arrest climate breakdown and protect biodiversity, especially pollinators. “My garden’s boundaries are the horizon,” wrote Derek Jarman inModern Nature.

In New York they enter the shadow world of “Bad Bridgets” – sex workers, thieves, drunkards and killers.Peppiatt and his Kneecap producer Trevor Birney optioned the historians’ book, Bad Bridget: Crime, Mayhem and the Lives of Irish Emigrant Women, and will collaborate with Robbie’s production company,LuckyChap.The Oscar-winning production designer James Price and the costume designer Kate Hawley will work on the film which is to begin shooting in Ireland andNorthern Irelandnext year.“I’d like to think we’ll have loads of influence over the film, but I suspect not,” said Farrell. “It’s slightly scary because you’ve got your set ideas as historians, we think of things in particular ways. So there’s a bit of letting go.”View image in fullscreenIrish emigrants sailing to the US during the Great Famine, 1850.Photograph: Illustrated London News/Getty ImagesMcCormick said they had trustedPeppiatt, a former tabloid reportergarlanded for Kneecap, his semi-autobiographical film about the rap trio of that name. “We’ll leave the film up to Rich. He is the expert and he has amazing ideas so we’re really looking forward to seeing how it turns out.”The original academic project, funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, unpicked the conventional narrative that female Irish emigrants were domestic servants, cooks, wives and mothers with reputations for diligence and rectitude.In the 1860s, Irish people made up about a quarter of New York’s population but Irish men comprised half of the male prison population and Irish women 86% of the female prison population. A survey of 1,238 foreign-born sex workers in the city found that 706, just over half, were Irish.The research uncovered individual stories, such as that of Ellen Price, who was described as appearing in a Toronto court in 1865 “drunk as usual, with a flaming red feather in her hat”. Led away to prison, she launched into a chorus of Rocky Road to Dublin.Margaret Brown, a pickpocket known as Old Mother Hubbard, tried to escape from a Chicago prison in 1877 by tying bedsheets together but fell and was badly injured. Lizzie Halliday, originally from County Antrim, was convicted of multiple murders and became the first woman sentenced to die in New York’s electric chair, but the sentence was commuted on grounds of insanity.Fans of the book and podcast, which has just launched a second season, valued learning about this side of the Irish emigrant experience, said Farrell. “It wasn’t all good wives and mothers and nuns or teachers. There’s a slightly darker side. I don’t want to meet those women but I love that we can see their strong attitudes and their defiance.”The historians hope aspects of their “favourite Bridgets” will end up on screen but in the meantime they will continue researching and teaching. “The talk of premieres and all that is really exciting but we still have to do our day jobs,” said McCormick. Even so, they could dream of glitz, Farrell joked. “That’s our main concern, you know, what we’ll wear for the red carpet.”Explore more on these topicsPodcastsIrelandWomenMigrationHeritageEuropeNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

I also really like the design and lots of people at my school have them – the colours are cute. I’d love a Jellycat – ideally the Eggetha Egg & Lance Soldier one – because it’s so cute. It’s from the Amuseables range, and they’re trending among my friends.I want a football goal, too, so I can practise my shooting skills in the park as I’m centre-midfield for my local team. This hair curler would save me so much time – I love doing my hair different ways, but I have to think ahead and plait my hair the night before if I want it wavy.

I don’t think we’ve gone far enough!’ The founder of Peta on gruesome stunts and her bloody fight for animal rightsAfter 45 years as chief fake blood thrower, Ingrid Newkirk is still waging war on everything from leather to cashmere. Is she still relevant?Morwenna FerrierSun 9 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTShareIngrid Newkirk was 54 when she thought she was going to die in a plane crash. It was late summer and the founderofPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals(Peta) was flying from Minneapolis in the US to the company HQ in Norfolk, Virginia when her plane encountered strong wind shear. The pilot attempted an emergency landing, but failed; back up they went.On the third attempt, with “a teaspoon of fuel” in the tank, he finally got the plane down safely. During those moments, Newkirk, now 76, scribbled a will on a napkin. She has tweaked it over the years, but it still reads like a horror movie prop list: her liver is to be sent to France to be made into foie gras, her skin to Hermès to create a handbag and her lips to whichever US president is in power, to shame them for granting a “patronising” pardon to a turkey each Thanksgiving. As wills go, it’s straight out of thePetaplaybook: an audacious stunt of the kind that has made them the world’s most well-known, successful and in some quarters reviled animal rights organisation. “I know I’ll never be made a dame,” Newkirk says, laughing. “I’m too controversial.”Forty-five years into Peta’s existence, she can claim to have won many battles. Animal testing ismarginally down, with multinational companies having to at least pay lip service to ideas around animal cruelty and environmentalism. Andaccording to YouGov, more than 25 million people worldwide have at least dipped a toe into veganism. Peta has certainly playedsomepart in this, with its celebrity endorsements and theatrical stunts now par for the course in mainstream activism. If they didn’t invent direct action, they normalised it. But when it comes to fashion, in an era defined by waste in which our wardrobes are directly linked to global economic, humanitarian and climate crises, do we simply have more pressing concerns than whether or not to wear cashmere? In short: is Peta still relevant?We meet in thePetaheadquarters, a relatively humdrum and leather-free office in a north London office block near the Regent’s canal. Newkirk looks a decade younger than she is, a little like Princess Diana but with a blond Chelsea bob. Her hair used to be longer but she recently cut off a few inches to sew into a scarf she plans to send to her favourite target, Condé Nast head honcho Anna Wintour. Peta has plagued the fashion icon for more than 30 years in protest at US Vogue’s historical policy of featuring animal skin and fur. The brown scarf,made entirely of human hair, is boxed up and on the table next to a plate of vegan croissants, Newkirk’s hair woven into the fringes. “It’s actually a peace offering,” she says, laughing. In using her own hair, she hopes to “teach Anna about consent”.Newkirk is in town to deliver the scarf (Wintour is here forLondon fashion week) but has found time for a grisly stunt in which she’ll dress up as a bloodied goat at one venue (Peta have industry moles tipping them off on show locations and schedules). The target is the cruelty of cashmere farming in Mongolia – one of Peta’s betes noires, along with wool and shearling. “It’s about tactics, and tactics I think work,” she says. But, frankly, she could be talking about any number of the antics that have studded her 45-year-long career.View image in fullscreenNewkirk at London fashion week in September, protesting about the treatment of goats during cashmere production.Photograph: SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty ImagesTake the Victoria’s Secret show in 2002 when a protester got past security to storm the catwalk holding a “Gisele: Fur Scum” sign aimed at the supermodel, or in 2005, when Newkirk lay naked in a coffin in New York’s Times Square to protest at fur in Macy’s. But it was the “I’d rather go naked than wear fur” campaign in the 90s, which saw celebrities such as Kim Basinger and Christy Turlington make good on that promise, that put Peta on the map. Newkirk has lost count of the amount of tofu pies and fake blood thrown at notables since then.But if Peta excel in manufacturing outrage for publicity, they overstep the mark, too. In 2003, they compared thetreatment of animals to the Holocaust, and in 2011referenced the slave tradewhen campaigning to free orcas from an amusement park. “Slavery is not something we can only apply to one species – our own,” Newkirk insists. “To capture, deprive of freedom of movement and association, and to extract forced labour from the orcas fit the definition of slavery.”A “holocaust on your plate” exhibit they displayed was condemned as “graphic” by the Greater London Authority and “shocking and outrageous” by Manchester City Council – and was ultimately banned in the UK. Did she regret the comparison? “It was powerful, but some people, as people do, took it as an attack on them, which it certainly was not.”As you know, the press likes the gawky, gimmicky, sexy bits, so that’s what we’re most associated withNewkirk is broadly unapologetic about Peta’s past stunts. “You might say they are shocking, but it’s just the shocking facts,” she says, plainly. Does she regret any of them? “I have no regrets.” Does she think they ever went too far? “I don’t think we went far enough.”In 2015 Peta sued the photographerbehind a viral series of “monkey selfies”, saying the macaque should hold the copyright and get the proceeds of any sales.The case settled; the publicity went around the world.In the end, whether it’s zoos or fur coats, it all comes back to her central idea that animals and humans are one and the same, and when it comes to animal rights, she is absolute. “We don’twantto put a tofu pie in someone’s face. We don’twantto take red paint on to a catwalk. I don’t enjoy it, I’d prefer it wasn’t like this, but I’m just showing the facts,” she says. “We lose members sometimes. They say we alienate. But you try talking to the press with a list of hard facts on white paper. It’s dull. It’s not news. Chain yourself to the front of a Canada Goose store and gotcha! You get coverage.”Their approach seems to have mellowed over the years; one of their softer tactics is buying shares in the companies they “want to change”, to lobby from the inside. They hold shares in conglomerates such as Kering, Prada and LVMH, which gives them a seat at the boardroom table and access to the CEOs. Peta takes credit for H&M no longer using new down and feathers, and Kering banning fur across their brands in 2021.Mention of Peta’s name is enough to provoke ire and terror in companies that use animal products, but they aren’t exactly beloved in the world of activism either. One environmental campaigner told the Guardian that Peta “have a reputation for riding roughshod over anyone else’s work, sensibilities and strategies”. Newkirk insists they’ve always taken a more measured approach, “talking, writing and litigating” to make their case, “but as you know, the press likes the gawky, gimmicky, sexy bits, so that’s what we’re most associated with”.Newkirk was born in Surrey in 1949. Her father was an engineer and the family moved around, going to India when she was seven, where she went to boarding school, though they also spent time in Orkney. There, her bedroom was full of feather headdresses and statues made of seal fur, souvenirs brought home by her father who often worked overseas. Going to the circus was a family day out. Her uncle owned a dairy farm. They all wore head-to-toe wool. “I loved animals. Let’s just say it took a while for the lights to come on.”Back then, animal protesting didn’t extend beyond shouting about foxhunting. She’s had a few Damascene moments, but the one that sticks in her mind took place in the early 70s. Newly married to an American (they have since divorced) and living in rural Maryland, Newkirk was training to be a stockbroker. One day she discovered a litter of kittens abandoned by a neighbour, and took them to a shelter. The next day, she went back to check on them, only to be told they had been put down. “I was stunned, utterly horrified. It changed everything.”She begged the shelter’s manager for a job. When he agreed, she began this second career, which involved short stints as an animal inspector, then deputy sheriff focusing on animal cruelty cases, then a cruelty law enforcement officer, before becoming the first female master at a dog pound. Through her work, she met fellow animal rights activist Alex Pacheco and in 1980 they founded Peta (he left the company in 1999), though their first fashion stunt – a naked protest on the Oscar de la Renta catwalk – didn’t happen for another decade.When I imply her career may have been complicated by the fact that she’s a woman, she pauses briefly, then balks. “Have I been treated differently? I don’t like the idea that people might have treated me differently,” she says. “But it’s true that people love to ask how I justify working for animal rights given what else is going on in the world and they would never ask a Premier League footballer how they justify playing football.”For a period in the 90s and 00s, Peta was sustained by celebrities who flocked to the cause. Alicia Silverstone, Alec Baldwin, Drew Barrymore, Anjelica Huston and various top-earning supermodels have all backed Peta. Some are approached by the organisation; others, such as Pamela Anderson – Peta’s most famous advocate – come to them. Newkirk recalls receiving a letter from Anderson handwritten on lilac stationery saying she was on a show called Baywatch, but all the press wanted to talk about was her “boobs and boyfriends”; she wanted to use her position to talk about animals. “Inside that big chest beats a very big heart,” Newkirk says.Anderson and the naked campaigns made Peta a household name, but not everyone felt the cause needed nudity to make an impact. Newkirk can’t understand the backlash. “What is so shocking about a naked body? I think it shows strength,” she says. “Thatisfeminism, it’s consensual, it’s Lady Godiva! The Peta women have the right to use their bodies however they wish – we don’t live in Afghanistan. How dare men or other women dictate how much they must cover up.” This is why she admires Anderson. “I’m not a beauty, I don’t have any assets. If I had them, would it have made a difference? Who knows. But she has worked it so well,” she laughs.View image in fullscreenNewkirk protesting outside a KFC in Mumbai in 2014.Photograph: Punit Paranjpe/AFP/Getty ImagesWhile other activists are suspicious of them, those methods have enjoyed a certain amount of success.Peta now has more than 10 million members and supporters, and more than 800 staff worldwide, according to Newkirk. The people who work there tend to be vegan. If Peta isn’t terribly popular within fashion and activism, Newkirk must be at work: around a third of Peta’s staff have been there for more than a decade.Their targets are divided between factory farming, animal research, animal entertainment (such as circuses) and using animal products in fashion and beauty. It’s the last one that carries the most everyday tension, and lands the headlines. “I treat them all as ‘lifestyle’ – food, fashion, it’s all related,” Newkirk says. “If I had to pick a cause that matters most, I couldn’t.”These days, she has largely swapped the stunts for strategising and emails – she receives around a thousand a day – mostly on the road between Washington, Hamburg, India and Norfolk, Virginia. She works seven days a week, leaving little time to cook – breakfast is soy sausages and bean burritos reheated in the microwave. She has a long-term partner; to the disappointment of her mother, she was sterilised in her 20s – “I love children but there are already surplus in the world.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Does she worry about the environmental impact? “It cannot hold a candle to meat, dairy and egg production, which is a bigger contributor to the climate crisis than all forms of transportation put together.”Peta’s aim – to change how the world sees, treats and protects animals – has remained largely unchanged over 45 years, but in terms of animal skins, they’ve made huge progress. “We don’t take full credit for this,” Newkirk says. “I mean, we work our socks off, and a lot of it is attributable to us. But there are lots of companies doing great work, too. Stella McCartney, for example. I knew her mother, and Stella didn’t fall far from the tree. She has always known the use of animals is wrong.”McCartney, who whips up impressively vegan clothes using faux leather, is one of the industry’s most vocal animal and cruelty-free advocates. “My mum and Ingrid were friends – they shared a fearless belief that kindness can change the world,” she tells me in an email. “They’ve never been afraid to call the industry out … That bravery has provoked conversations that needed to happen, often with an edge and even humour.”One of the people who has borne the brunt of this “humour” is Wintour. Newkirk has lost track of the number of Peta stunts levelled at the former Vogue editor, including writing to the IRS “to see if she was declaring tax on free fur gifts”; throwing a dead racoon into her soup at the Four Seasons in New York; occupying, then graffitti-ing Vogue’s HQ (Wintour locked herself in her office and the stunt landed Newkirk in a cell for a night); and offering her a brain scan to check if her motor neurons were underdeveloped. Did Wintour ever reply? “She did not.” Still, the big fur ads stopped appearing in the magazine and its publisher, Condé Nast, says it will no longer feature fur in its titles.Thanks in large part to our relentless campaigning, most of today’s fashion-minded crowd wouldn’t be caught dead in furWas that Peta’s doing? “It’s certainly a signal that fashion is finally shifting,” Newkirk says. “Some people resist change more than others but, thanks in large part to our relentless campaigning, most of today’s fashion-minded crowd wouldn’t be caught dead in fur.”She’s half right. On paper, the fur industry has been dwindling for years. Calvin Klein was among the first big fashion houses to ban it in 1994. Then came Ralph Lauren a decade later. It wasn’t until 2017 when Gucci stopped using fur that things sped up. Burberry, Celine, Patou, Prada, Versace and Marc Jacobs followed. Global fur production fell85%in the last decade, according to the Fur Free Alliance. This year is the first that London fashion week hasbanned all animal skins, and though Paris and Milan have yet to follow suit – among the fashion houses holding firm is Italian brand Fendi, founded a hundred years ago as a fur and leather shop – it’s unusual to see real fur on the catwalk.Instead there has been a slow creep in very realistic fake fur in fashion shows – and with that a renewed demand for vintage fur, which is usually much cheaper. This is good news, says Tea Baines, marketing manager at cult secondhand shopBeyond Retro, because it is “opposed to modern fur production”, while also noting that it is a more sustainable alternative than simply “sending it to landfill, where it would add to textile waste”. The hope “is to ease the pressure on both modern fur and mass-produced faux-fur production”.Newkirk is horrified by the idea that real fur is on trend again, even if it is vintage. “If it comes back, it is a failing on our part. But I also believe it’s a trend, so not lasting; it’s for effect, and it’s flamboyant rubbish.”I always had turkey at Christmas. Then I adopted one. How would I feel about eating my own bird?Read moreShe’s right that trends come and go. But for the past decade, fashion has become as preoccupied with the environment as animal rights. Faux fur is often made from plastic derivatives, which means real, secondhand fur is seen as better for the environment. Just ask Rihanna, who wore old Galliano mink out and about in New York last Christmas without a tofu pie in sight.Newkirk shakes her head. “If you care about health, then eating meat clogs your arteries – and if you care about the climate, you can’t possibly continue to eat animals or consume dairy,” she says, citing methane production and over-farming as the real issue for environmentalists. “People who claim to be one but who eat meat and wear animals just need to look at the amount of energy used in angora production.”One issue could be affordability: not everyone can afford an ethical lifestyle. “But the cost is coming down,” she says. Even so, isn’t real animal skin better for the environment than its faux counterparts? “Look. If the argument is that plastic isn’t biodegradable, then neither is leather – it doesn’t break down because of what it’s been treated with, so that’s neither here nor there,” she says. “It’s fashion, things get replaced.”In person Newkirk is warm and charming, with a wry sense of humour, until you query her defining worldview – that animals have the same rights as humans – at which point the clouds darken, those sharp blue eyes narrow and the proselytising begins.“Even if it’s sustainable, whatever that means, you wouldn’t make something in human skin just because that person was skinned in their sleep at the time, would you?”It’s perhaps a surprise that Newkirk even considers these questions. Yet among her proclamations there is pragmatism, and even logic. If you’re wearing vintage fur, you are arguably perpetuating the idea of fur, she says, which is why Peta has a “fur kitchen”. A what? “People can donate old fur coats to the homeless. Anjelica Huston gave us some, and we’re trying to get Yoko Ono to give up her refrigerated room of fur.” Peta are happy for fur to be used in this way because it’s not as a fashion statement. They also donate fur for school presentations about animals. The best solution for us all is buying secondhand clothing, she says, pointing at her chintz jacket, which came from a charity shop.Afew days after we meet, images of Newkirkdressed up as a goatappear online. She’s wearing a fake fur coat doused in fake blood, lying down on the Strand in London and pretending to have hair violently combed from her body while miming along to the actual sound of screaming goats recorded during a Peta investigation.By the usual standards of the group, the stunt falls slightly flat, drawing a small crowd and meagre press coverage. The same could be said for a semi-naked protest in Pamplona over the famous bull run in July, or the man who lay down outside a Gucci store in Kuala Lumpur in January dressed as a python in protest at their use of snakeskin, neither of which made the news as once they would have. In those moments Peta can feel a relic of a bygone era. Still, it would be impossible to deny the impact Peta – and Newkirk’s singular vision – have had on animal rights, and will continue to have. Her impulse to try to convert everyone she meets to veganism will never leave her, though she admits it’s been a while since she’s had to accost anyone for wearing mink on the street. Is that because the war on fur is largely won? “I’d like to think so,” she says.Explore more on these topicsPetaAnimal welfareVeganismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Later photograph: Pål Hansen. Grooming: Josie McIver at Creatives Agency Ltd. Archive image: courtesy of Harry Aikines-AryeeteyBorn in Carshalton, London, in 1988, Harry Aikines-Aryeetey is a British sprinter and broadcaster. He became the first athlete to win both the 100m and 200m at the World Youth Championships, in 2005; he went on to compete in the Rio Olympics, and to represent Great Britain at multiple world championships, European championships and Commonwealth Games. In 2023, he moved into TV – joining the Gladiators team as Nitro. He lives in London with his wife and daughter. Aikines-Aryeetey is a contestant in this year’s Strictly Come Dancing.This pose is very much inspiredby my love of Hercules and superheroes, but mostly Popeye. I ate a lot of spinach as a kid thanks to that guy.I was born with a myostatin deficiency, which means I don’t need to train hard to build muscle, which is why, at the age of four, I already had biceps. As well as being strong, I had a lot of energy. Whenever my parents opened the front door, they had to look around to see where I was – if they didn’t clock me fast enough, I would escape on to the balcony of the estate and run away. Sport was my obsession – I was fanatical about WWE, and by the age of five all I wanted was to be a Gladiator. That show influenced every part of my life. I even ended up marrying a tanned brunette, just like my first crush, Jet.I had no idea how fast I could sprint until I was 12 and got chased by a dog. We didn’t have pets at home so I had no idea that if you run away from a dog they think you want to play. Fortunately, in this instance, it was just a labrador, and even more fortunately a coach was watching me. He approached me and said: “You’re really fast. Go to Lesley Alder on a Tuesday night and train with him.” Lesley was a hurdles coach, and had a few people from my school who trained with him. I wasn’t a great hurdler but loved sprinting. My parents weren’t so enthusiastic. They wanted me to have a solid education and a proper job. I had to fight to convince them athletics was worth it.By the time I was14, I was the fastestin Europe. I had to be the best in order to justify doing it at all. Every year my parents would tell me I had one more year left to compete – and then I would win a national title, orBBCYoung Sports Personality of the Year, or get sponsored by Nike, and I was allowed to keep competing. At the same time, I had to work hard academically at school. Anything less than an A was considered a failure.Dad was so happy that he finally got his son that he bought a sound system to celebrate. Apparently, they had a rave for a monthIt sounds extreme, but I can understand why my parents were hard on me. My dad came over from Ghana in the late 80s – he was well educated, but when he got to London he had to start all over again. Once he was on his feet financially, he brought my mum and sisters over. Then I came along. Dad was so happy that he finally got his son that he went out and bought a sound system to celebrate. Apparently, they had a rave for a month.Throughout my childhood, my parents were like passing ships. They worked so hard to give us every opportunity and comfort we needed. The house was always filled with the smell of delicious dishes like plantain and okra stew, and we were taught how to cook and clean at a young age so we were independent. No matter how busy he was, my dad had the biggest smile on his face. As well as a work ethic, our family believes that as long as we have each other we will be all right. My big sisters used to dress me up in a pink polka‑dot dress to wind my dad up. We weren’t the richest by any means, but we had everything.Even as a teenager, I never saw training as a sacrifice. I was spending all of my time with like-minded boys and girls, improving my fitness, and making bonds with people who are still my friends now. We were all into [the anime series] Dragon Ball Z, and in between training talked about the latest episode, as well as practising the dance moves to whatever Sean Paul or Jagged Edge videos we’d seen on MTV Base. It was pure innocence and enjoyment.Once you get to a certain level in sport, the outside world starts to stereotype you. There are times when I’ve experienced microaggressions – expectations that were imposed on me because I’m a big, strong black man. I’ve had people surprised that my name is Harry, or that I am well spoken. I was told that I was too “nice” to be a sprinter. There was this sense that I stuck out because I didn’t fit some aggressive rapper type – I wasn’t the sort of guy to stare down the track and look aggy. Of course I can zone in when I need to, but because of my upbringing, my default is to look happy. There are also times when I’ve won medals for Great Britain and I’ve had people say: “Well, you’re not really British, are you?” I was brought up in this country and I’m very passionate about the monarchy. How does it feel? I’ve taken all of it on the chin and made sure that I turned the negatives into a positive; it’s my goal to push the narrative forward. Whatever anyone says, I embrace who I am, and Gladiators has been a huge part of that self-acceptance. I can truly be myself and be celebrated for it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

He thought it was disgusting’’Read moreDealing with failure is a big partof being an athlete. By the time I was 16, I had a stress fracture in my back. I still managed to win the World Juniors, but the following year I pushed it too far. Just as I had the world at my feet, I was put in a back brace. My parents were good at keeping my spirits up, my friends took me out clubbing, I did a lot of pilates and I was ready to go again. When I got injured again earlier this year I had to take a break from Gladiators. I worried I’d never be my full self again. But the whole experience taught me about how important it is to fortify your mentality. My body is my tool, but I’ve got to be stable psychologically, too. I was bed-bound but still found ways to be happy every day, whether it was eating a Crunchie or playing a computer game. Plus, in that down time other opportunities came up: I started doing more presenting and realised I was more than just a body. I felt more looked after in the TV industry compared with the track world, too. If you’re not useful in the sports business, then you’re not used at all.My daughter is around the same age as I was in that photo. Being strong definitely comes in handy as a dad – she loves it when I throw her in the air and catch her. She always laughs, but she’s the first to tell me to stop if she spots another child who wants a turn. That thoughtfulness comes straight from my parents, who taught me that everyone should have a good time. It’s a message that’s run through everything I’ve ever done – athletics, Gladiators or presenting. It’s in my roots. I’m here to make people smile.Explore more on these topicsFamilyFlashbackPhotographyStrictly Come DancingBBCEntertainment TVReality TVTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But they’ve already been usurped by a spot in a repurposed office block less than half a mile away.The fabulously bizarreLilibet’sopened her doors with little or no fanfare in mid-September, beckoning us into her world of strange. Behold the antique fireplaces, the floral chairs and wallpaper, the multitude of gilt-framed, 18th-century French paintings, the pretty etched glassware, the monogrammed napkins, the tall dinner candles. Lilibet’s has about it the air of how the palace of Versailles would look if its designers (in Lilibet’s caseRussell Sage Studio) had been allowed really to let their hair down. The restaurant, by Ross Shonhan, ex-Nobuexecutive chefand founder of theBone Daddiesramen chain, is named after our beloved Queen Elizabeth II, God rest her mortal soul. Apparently, our former monarch was born in this very building on 21 April 1926, when the site was still a Mayfair townhouse.View image in fullscreen‘Really very,verygood’: Lilibet’s ricotta agnolotti with lemon and sage.And what better way to pay tribute to Her Maj than by creating from scratch a multimillion-pound, turbo-chintz, mock-aristocratic dining room serving fire-roasted beef-fat oysters, deluxe seafood platters, anchovy eclairs,trou Normandand a rather regal-sounding fish triptych. “What is a fish triptych?” I hear you cry. Well, this is when the diner selects a fish – gurnard, sea bass or sea bream – and it is then served in three ways: crudo, grilled and as a soup madeà la minutefrom its bones. Is there anything more “trapped at Balmoral for the summer when you’d rather be in the Bahamas” than a fish triptych? Did a fish triptych finally send the Sussexes fleeing to LA? I’m being churlish, of course, because a fish triptych is a fantastically eco-friendly way to eat all the parts of a fish, and is not just –cough– “leftovers”.Still, from the moment you enter, Lilibet’s throws up many questions. You, the bedazzled diner, will sit on your multi-cushioned boudoir chair in this charming, Las Vegas-style royalist fever dream, head spinning and muttering, “But how does it feel and smell so convincingly ancient when it’s been here for only a matter of weeks?” Where the hell do you buy a room fragrance called “Old Forgotten Chamber in the West Wing of Buckingham Palace circa 1976”? In many ways, Lilibet’s is the world’s sexiest purpose-built National Trust building, because, inarguably, all bank holiday Monday visits to a doily-festooned pile would be improved by having a bit less “here’s a moth-eaten tapestry” and a lot more “here’s a twinkly, pink velour-seated cocktail bar – would you like a plate of Cornish crab tarts and a lemon verbena martini?”View image in fullscreen‘The meal I’ll keep returning for’: Lilibet’s dover sole with Café de Paris butter.Obviously, all of the above would be extra-hilarious if the food was dire and the atmosphere stiff, but neither of those is true. Lilibet’s is, rather, pure joy. It’s high drama, camp as heck and utterly uncopyable. This is the place to take your out-of-town parents, your lover who feels neglected, and clients you really don’t want to talk to, because they’ll certainly be distracted by the decor as well as by the plates of fritto misto, warm pittas with spiced tomato salsa, chrysanthemum salad with Caesar dressing and, one of the best things I tasted here, the freshly made ricotta agnolotti with sage and lemon sauce, which is really very,verygood.The meal I’ll keep returning for, though, will be the dover sole, expertly filleted tableside and served with Café de Paris butter, with a side of Lilibet’s mash, which of course comes topped with shellfish bisque and lobster meat, and perhaps with the sprouting broccoli topped withcolaturavinaigrette, chilli and mint alongside. And if you’re not struck with fish, I’ve also heard great things about Lilibet’s veal holstein escalope and its bone-in ribeye.View image in fullscreen‘Like something out of a Tom and Jerry cartoon’: Lilibet’schoux à la crème.Photograph: Beca B Jones/The GuardianThe dessert menu, too, will raise an eyebrow, not least because it features a steak sandwichprego, for some reason that remains unclear to me, because I was too busy debating having the crepe suzette, the princess sponge cake with raspberries and almonds, or the pile ofchoux à la crèmethat turns up on a glass stand looking like something out of a Tom and Jerry cartoon, only to be covered in an entire jugful of hot chocolate sauce.Lilibet’s is endlessly lovable. In fact, I’d go so far as to say it’s my new favourite restaurant. I’m not sure I entirely buy into all the various elements of its royal backstory, but it’s nevertheless a lovely dance through regal Wibbly Wobbly World. It serves mash topped with lobster, too, so I’m more than happy to eat and drink in the fairytale.Lilibet’s17 Bruton Street, London W1, 020-3828 8388.

This richly flavoured cornerstone of the US midwest is a treat on a cold day – here’s how to perfect itFelicity CloakeSun 9 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Nov 2025 08.03 ESTShareBeer and cheese, two ingredients that don’t immediately scream soup to much of the world, are the cornerstones of one such midwestern speciality, particularly beloved in Wisconsin, with its prominent dairy and brewing industries.Beersoups are also found from Alsace to Russia (and, indeed, Wisconsin has a significant northern European heritage population). The cheese, however, appears to be an inspired American addition (though, seeing as Germany boasts both beer and cheese soups, I’m prepared to stand corrected), playing off the bittersweetness of the beer to produce a richly flavoured dish that’s perfectly suited to harsh midwestern winters. That said, it’s a treat on a cold day wherever you are.(Note: this is not to be confused with Germanobatzda, while a thicker version is a popular hot dip in Kentucky, in particular.)The baseView image in fullscreenAmerica’s Test Kitchen’s beer cheese soup doubles down on its sweetness with carrot. All thumbnail images by Felicity Cloake.Many recipes start with a classic sweated onion base, with Saveur magazine also adding shallot, while Wisconsin-native “photographer, author, stylist and farmer” (as she’s described inthe Blasta Soup book)Imen McDonnelladds leek to the mix. Both of these contribute a pleasant sweetness that works well with the beer, but shallot always feels to me as if it has more of an affinity with wine-based dishes, while leek is a time-honoured pairing with cheese. Double down on that sweetness with the carrots used byMinnesota’s Amy Thielenand America’s Test Kitchen, which my testers and I prefer to the former’s red pepper (“Nice, but gives it more of a Tex-Mex vibe” – never mind that Thielen’s recipe comes from Minneapolis chef Steven Brown).McDonnell also adds garlic and rosemary, and starts her soup off with bacon, scooping it from the pan to use as a garnish, and frying the vegetables in its fat. This is an excellent idea, not least for ramping up the savoury flavours, and also feels very American (if in doubt, add bacon), though butter or oil will also work if you’d prefer to keep things meat-free. (No doubt this could also be made with plant-based cheeses, which have come on leaps and bounds in recent years, but I haven’t tried it myself.)The liquidView image in fullscreenAmy Thielen’s beer cheese soup favours ‘a mildly flavoured blonde or pale ale’.A soup made from beer alone is likely to be unpleasantly bitter, so it’s usual to cut it with stock (a neutral chicken is the most popular choice, but you could use Saveur’s vegetable variety, or the beef stock called for byLizzie Kamenetzky in Winter Cabin Cooking, as included inHenrietta Clancy’s book Just Soup) and some sort of dairy. Thielen goes for half-and-half (a slightly thinner US single cream equivalent), and Kamenetzky and McDonnell with a finishing dash of double cream. Given the richness of the cheese, however, I’m inclined to agree with America’s Test Kitchen that“milk work[s] better than the usual cream and half-and-half, which are both heavy, even when cut with chicken broth”.Beerwise, Bianca Valencia, Dee Laffan and Mei Chin, compilers of the Blasta BooksSoupcollection, write that McDonnell’s “ideal beer for this soup is Wisconsin’s Pabst Blue Ribbon, but it’s not easily available here in Ireland. We suggest substituting it with a lager or pilsner.” Thielen, meanwhile, favours “a mildly flavoured blonde or pale ale”, Kamenetzky lager or golden beer, and Saveur “ale”. My testers have a strong preference for mellower, American-style lagers here, as opposed to richer, hoppier blondes and pale ales, which can become bitter and cloying when heated.That said, one should be able to taste the beer; it’s not here just for show, which is why McDonnell’s recipe is so clever. She adds half early on in the process, reducing it to concentrate the flavour, and the remainder near the end of the cooking time, so its freshness does’t get lost. (Teetotallers: alcohol-free lager ought to work just as well.)The thickenerAll the recipes use a roux, with the exception of Kamenetzky’s, which comes from the Swiss Valais region rather than the US, because the idea of bread as thickener intrigued me. She uses a rye loaf, which, when soaked in blonde beer, makes for a very strongly flavoured dish – if I made it again, I wouldn’t bother to puree it, because my testers struggled with the thick, porridge-like consistency; cubes of softened bread in a beery broth would be more akin to similar dishes I’ve eaten in the Italian Alps.Most recipes suggest whizzing the soup until smooth, but, given the richness of the ingredients, my testers and I decide we prefer the chunkiness of McDonnell’s version, which feels less like drinking a fondue (she also stirs in steamed broccoli towards the end, which works wonderfully with the cheese; that said, it turns this into a slightly different dish, so I’ve left it out). Feel free to get your stick blender out if you’d prefer a silkier result, though I’m not sure elegance is what this dish aspires to.The cheeseView image in fullscreenLizzie Kamenetzky’s beer cheese soup uses raclette.Cheddar is the most common choice – but beware! As America’s Test Kitchen explains, “low-moisture cheeses like flavourful aged cheddar are likely to break when melted – resulting in a grainy, greasy soup”. Their solution is to add American cheese, which “contains emulsifiers to promote melting”, but I find that as long as you stick to medium rather than mature varieties (which would, to my mind, be far too strong to consume in such quantity, anyway), add it slowly and don’t let the soup boil, there should be no issue with splitting, and thus no need for processed cheese or the cornflour ATK sprinkle in “to prevent clumping”.As long as you steer clear of anything too hard and dry, you can play around with the mixture as you see fit: Kamenetzky uses raclette, McDonnell a little smoked cheddar, while Saveur crumbles gorgonzola on top to serve (personally, the last feels like a cheese too many, but perhaps I’m being too British).The seasoningsView image in fullscreenSaveur’s beer cheese soup is seasoned with caraway seeds.The Saveur magazine editors’book of Soups and Stews(from 2015, when they still published both a print magazine and books) seasons the soup with caraway seeds, which feels like a nod to Bavarianobatzda, and works brilliantly with the beer – I’ve also added a pinch of sweet paprika for both its colour and gentle warmth, and McDonnell’s mustard powder for the same reason. If you’re not keen on caraway, we also very much enjoyed the thyme used by many recipes.Fans of Welsh rarebit should take a look at Thielen’s recipe in her book The New Midwestern Table, which I picked up on a visit to Chicago many years ago when I realised how little I knew about the cuisine of this vast swathe of the States. Seasoned with nutmeg, dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce, it feels a lot like toast in a bowl, topped with a jaunty dash of peppery mustard oil.Serving suggestionsView image in fullscreenImen McDonnell serves her beer cheese soup in a hollowed-out bread roll.“The best way to showcase this American beauty? In a bread bowl, of course,” McDonnell writes. Individual crusty rolls mean you don’t have to all hunch around one large boule clashing spoons and resolving finally to book that flu jab. Chives are my garnish of choice with cheese. You could make this ahead of time up to the point when you add the milk, and then very gently reheat it before adding the cheese, though you might need a splash of extra stock or milk to loosen it.Perfect beer cheese soupView image in fullscreenFelicity Cloake’s perfect beer cheese soup.Prep10 minCook30 minServes42 tbsp butter, or oil100g bacon lardons(optional)1 medium onion, peeled and finely chopped1 medium carrot, trimmed and finely diced1 medium leek, trimmed and very finely sliced1 tsp caraway seeds, lightly crushed½ tsp sweet paprika230ml American-style lager400ml chicken or vegetable stock1 tbsp flour1 tbsp mustard powder175ml milk200g medium cheddar, grated4 crusty bread rolls, insides hollowed out and saved for breadcrumbs (optional)Chopped chives, to serveMelt half the fat in a medium saucepan, then fry the bacon, if using, on a medium heat until golden and crisp.

There are lots of offers coming into your inbox so it is difficult to sift through them all but then you see a great bargain from your favourite clothes shop.You follow the link from the email in the hope of bagging one of the few remaining jumpers you have had your eye on. The website looks identical to the one you have been on many times so you pay your money for the jumper via bank transfer and settle back, content that you have secured a bargain.The jumper will never arrive, however, as you have fallen for one of the many scams that have caused Black Friday to be calledBlack Fraud Dayby one expert.This year Black Friday falls on 28 November, but discounts and offers are advertised by some retailers week in advance. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has warned people to be on their guard in the run up to the day, and to stop the minute a purchase appears suspicious.The cybersecurity firm Darktrace says there has been a sharp rise in the number of malicious emails mentioning Black Friday through October, with most coming on the last day of the month.Jonathon Ellison, the director for national resilience at the NCSC, adds: “This is … a time when cyber criminals seek to exploit our increased spending, using trusted brands, popular products, and current events to deceive people into clicking malicious links or sharing personal and financial information.”The increased availability of artificial intelligence tools means criminals can createauthentic-looking websitesmimicking famous brands and potentially duping people into handing over money.They may also create fake small businesses, says Adrian Ludwig of Tools for Humanity, a tech company.“With AI, fraudsters can now create entire deceptive small-business identities, complete with faces, stories and photo-perfect shops in just minutes,” he says.What the scam looks likeThe offer may come via email or you may see it on social media, posted from an account which was created recently.The Consumer group Which? says that unrealistically low prices which are inconsistent with other sites should be one of the first alerts.When you click through you may find a website which is not fully developed. It may not have a privacy policy, a postage address or an “about us” page.Instead of asking you to pay by credit or debit card, it will request a bank transfer, the preferred method of moving money by organised crime gangs. Website that ask for payment by cryptocurrency should also raise alarm bells.The illegitimate site may also have an impersonated URL. “Scammers will turn John Lewis into J0hn Lewis (with a zero) … to trick rushed consumers,” said Nathaniel Jones of Darktrace.There will often be an element of urgency to the sale – the site might say you only have a few minutes to secure the deal, or claim there are only a few items left in stock and that you should act immediately to secure one.What to doThe NCSC advises anyone who receives an email they suspect is a scam to forward it to theSuspicious Email Reporting Service. Suspicious text messages should be sent to 7726.If you become a victim of fraud and lose money to a scam, in the UK contact Action Fraud, the national reporting centre for fraud.But mostly, be alert. If there is anything even remotely suspicious about a sale, stop and think. Try to use a credit card for payments, as in the UK many sales will be protected under the Consumer Credit Act 1974.Explore more on these topicsScamsScam watchBlack FridayE-commerceShoppingConsumer affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A favourite is Arkonaplatz in the Mitte district, which is especially alluring in autumn when the light and surrounding trees take on golden shades. There’s old film and camera equipment to be had here, as well as industrial furniture. My favourite buy is a huge, hand-crocheted blanket in shades of lapis and rust.The Rathaus Schöneberg flea market in Tempelhof-Schöneberg is one of Berlin’s oldest, and is located where John F Kennedy made his famous “Ich bin ein Berliner” speech. It’s mostly the wares of people having a clear-out, as opposed to professional dealers, and is affordable.For the most beautiful setting, the Bode antique and book market on Museum Island is pure romanceLesser known to non-Berliners, Neukölln’s Kranoldplatz Flohmarkt – in one of the city’s most vibrant alternative neighbourhoods – is a good choice for cool castoffs. Strict regulations limit what vendors can sell, too, so you’re spared much of the new, mass-produced junk you might find elsewhere.For the most beautiful setting, though, the Bode antique and book market on Museum Island is pure romance. I can’t read any of the books I’ve bought there, nor have I ever served cake with the silver-plated slice I found there, but who cares?Secondhand stores can be found all over the city – but it’s worth homing in on Friedrichshain. It’s home to Europe’s biggest Humana store (five floors of vintage treasure, including a selection of lederhosen) and there are several smaller outfits here, too.V Vintage(Kopernikusstraße 18 and Grünberger Straße 50) has a great range of pieces, from vintage denim to retro après-ski, whileSoul and Style(Krossener Straße 24 and Frankfurter Allee 35-37) serves up fashion with a distinctly 80s flair, complete with band T-shirts, glitter and lurid shell suits.For more insider tips, check out@ezcape,@jessica.miushaAthensView image in fullscreenAntique objects for sale at a shop in Monastiraki, central Athens.Photograph: Simon RB Brown/AlamyWho wouldn’t have old things on their mind when visiting the cradle of western civilisation? Once you’ve taken in the Acropolis and Parthenon, swerve the stalls selling fridge magnets of ancient ruins and head to the port city of Piraeus. About 5 miles south-west of Athens, it’s where the ferries depart for hundreds of Greek islands and a Sunday flea market takes place, alongside the railway tracks, until 2pm-ish. There’s often good retro clothing and vintage homewares – be prepared to rummage, sometimes at ground level, as not all vendors set up on tables. Then head for lunch at one of the many waterfront restaurants.Another Sunday option is Pazari Rakosyllekton, or Scavengers’ Fleamarket (the name alone gets my treasure-hunt heart racing), a few minutes’ walk from Eleonas station, selling everything from furniture and homewares to books and records. Having found Olivia Newton-John’s Xanadu here, I feel I’ve peaked.Elsewhere, curated vintage stores includeKilo Shop(Ermou 120), where finds are charged by weight and rails restocked every second day. Higher-end options includeAnthophile Vintage(Zoodochou Pigis 55), where florals and whimsy reign, andHandpicked Cherries(Frinis 51) for vintage leather and Y2K treats.For more insider tips, check out@athens_thrifts,@posh.vintageStockholmView image in fullscreenAloppisis a ‘particularly Swedish experience – not quite a garage sale, not quite a flea market’Photograph: Berndt-Joel Gunnarsson/AlamySweden and its Scandi neighbours are known for being savagely pricey, so balance the books with a touch of secondhand shopping. Stockholm has two stores from the popular European chainHumana– one in the Norrmalm district and another in Södermalm – good for clothing and accessories. With several locations around the city,Myrorna– owned by the Swedish arm of the Salvation Army – is more for your home than wardrobe. Gustavsberg porcelain and stylish glassware by Kosta Boda pop up frequently, as do pieces by other Nordic brands, such as Marimekko.Södermalm is also home to a branch of the UK chainBeyond RetroandJudits Second Hand(Hornsgatan 75), which operates partly on a consignment basis, selling unwanted garments of local people for a split.For a particularly Swedish experience, seek out aloppis. Not quite a garage sale, not quite a flea market, it’s an immensely popular way to socialise on a weekend, while unearthing the treasure that is someone else’s trash. Some are spontaneous, others semi-permanent with on-site refreshment and music. Spring and summer are prime times forloppisrunda(loppis-hopping), especially in the countryside, but they can be found year-round (checkloppiskartan.se). A vintage Swedish Christmas tablecloth with matching fabric napkins and a pair of sleek brass reindeer, all from Uppsala, a 40-minute train journey north of Stockholm, remain beloved finds.For more insider tips, check out@modernretrostockholm,@vintageretrosimonand@myrornaopstenskip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

As well as its 29Humanashops, where you might stumble upon anything from 90s streetwear to 50s corsetry, those with a yen for designer labels should check out the city’s many upmarket secondhand boutiques, which are more akin to concept stores than thrift shops.TrySecond Chancein the city centre (Calle de la Virgen de los Peligros 11) for lightly used clothes by names such as Loewe, Dolce & Gabbana and Yves Saint Laurent. While not exactly bargains, they are far more affordable than they would be new.Denim is the staple atFriperie(Calle Rodriguez San Pedro 2), which has been name-checked by Vogue; and for those who consider Y2K to be vintage (rude) thenNearein the centre(Corre Alta de San Pablo 21)has a varied selection of clothing and accessories.AtPiel de Mariposa(Calle Embajadores 35)there are books, vinyl and homewares, as well as a good range of fashion and accessories, many for under €10 apiece.The traditional flea market experience is also readily available in Madrid: El Rastro, home to many restaurants and bars, bursts into life on Sundays, when the flea market takes over the neighbourhood. Be prepared to wade through lots of rubbish, but when you do strike gold (for me, the vintage ceramics are particularly beguiling) it glitters for real.For more insider tips, check out@rastro_madrid,@matiz.lifeAmiensView image in fullscreenA makeshift stall at Amiens’ biannual market.Photograph: Clémence MilletThere are plenty of reasons to visit Amiens, the capital of the Picardy region: France’s largest Gothic cathedral, the country’s first purpose-built museum (with displays covering everything from Egyptian artefacts to Francis Bacon), and for Channel-hoppers it’s only a 90-minute drive from Calais. Plus, twice a year it hoststhe Réderie, one of the largest flea markets in France.On the second last Sunday in April and the first Sunday in October, 2,000-plus vendors spread over 50-odd streets in the town centre.Aim to arrive on the Saturday, as many of the vendors start setting up the night before. So wrap up warmly, wear comfortable shoes and a head torch, and maybe you’ll bag an early bargain. Take a camping trolley for your finds: some of my favourites have included framed floral needlepoints, heavy brass swans and acrylic candleholders.While the biannual market is the big draw, the town has plenty to keep vintage lovers happy year-round.Fripes et Merveilles(151 Rue Gaulthier de Rumilly) is a time capsule of well-priced finds, from bric-a-brac to jewellery. Prices are far higher atSilk & Roses(18 Rue Saint-Martin aux Waides), but expect to find the likes of Kenzo, Moschino and Yves Saint Laurent. Meanwhile,Icône Friperie(21 Rue du Général Leclerc) charges by the kilo – €30 a haul.For more insider tips, check out#grandrederieamiens,@se_souvenir_des_belles_chosesExplore more on these topicsShopping tripsVintage fashionHomesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It may seem like an eccentric boast for a Facebook profile page, but then this is no mundane corner of the internet. The group where Rod and other men advertise themselves is a community where women and couples come, in many cases, to fulfil a lifelong dream: parenthood.There is a growing number of online sperm donor groups on social media. They offer people the chance of parenting children in an unregulated, dangerous but surprisingly straightforward way.Membership of groups such as Sperm Donors UK, Start a Family Here and “Get Your BABYDUST Here!” are thriving. This is due, in part, to the prohibitive cost of the official route – through a Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) regulated clinic.For those who do things by the book, the costs can easily run into tens of thousands of pounds, especially if they do not become pregnant at the first attempt.Lengthy delays and shortages of donors from certain religious backgrounds or ethnicities also drive many towards unregulated means.Selling sperm for profit is illegal in the UKand donors are allowed to be compensated only for legitimate costs. And with the illegal route comes considerable risks.In the groups there are numerous posts from women who describe having bad experiences. One woman in a same-sex relationship said they met their donor to receive a sperm deposit, only to find he would not go through with the deal unless the couple showed him their breasts.More alarming still are the responses, many of which tell the couple they should have gone to a sperm bank if they did not want to have a threesome with the donor. There is little time for sensitivity, it seems, in the competitive world of online sperm selling.Suddenly there were thousands of young women aged 18 to 25 joining, and membership went up to 10,000 within a yearFelicity, Facebook group memberHastily arranged online sperm donation can easily lead to the family courts, and judges have warned about the dangers of these ad hoc deals. Recently,a Guardian investigation into Robert Albon, an unregulated donor who claims to have 180 children across the world, revealed he has begun to seek access to his offspring through the courts in England and Wales. The situation has become a “horror story” for the women who paid for his donations.Felicity (not her real name), 39, divorced with one child and wanting another, joined the Start a Family Here group five or six years ago.“My daughter had been IVF due to male infertility – that was an awful experience so even though money wasn’t a problem, I didn’t want to go through with it again,” she says.When she first joined the group, it was “pretty quiet, just a few posts each week from people looking for a donor”.That began to change a couple of years ago when media coverage led to an influx of new members.“Suddenly there were thousands of young women aged 18 to 25 joining and membership went up to 10,000 within a year. Anonymous posting started to become the norm and women were rushing in without research, asking for last-minute donations,” she adds.Recent posts include one by a woman aged 18 hoping to get pregnant, one from someone asking for a donor “with a high rate of girls” and many people asking for urgent donations.“Need a donation some time this evening,” reads one post from a woman who is ovulating and has been “let down” by a donor. Others ask for donations “this weekend”.Felicity describes the younger members as “very immature and selfish”. She says many appear to be have mental health disorders – she has seen posts from women saying they had tried to kill themselves alongside those looking for a donor, while some were “desperate to have a baby, but it seems to be a fix for their own family trauma”.View image in fullscreenCosts for IVF treatment can easily run into tens of thousands of pounds, which is one reason online donor groups are so popular.Photograph: Natalia Lebedinskaia/Getty ImagesThe age profile of donors seems to be considerably higher than recipients – most appear to be between 35 and 50 – so “there’s huge scope for them taking advantage and manipulating the young women”, Felicity says.One common tactic often warned about in these communities is that men will pressure women into sex, telling those who want to use “artificial insemination” with a syringe or baster, that sexual intercourse is more successful at producing pregnancies, which is not true.Sex, euphemistically referred to as “natural insemination” in these groups, is not the preferred method for most women, and yet recipients who are desperate to get pregnant can be persuaded to allow their boundaries to be crossed.Many of the posts in the groups are from people who will donate only through sex or through a method they call “partial insemination”, where the donor’s penis is inserted immediately before ejaculation.In one post, a man complaining about rude recipients says he will no longer donate, except through natural insemination, while many, such as a young Russian donor, simply write something along the lines of: “The NI [natural insemination] method is free, the AI [artificial insemination] method is for money.”A significant problem according to Felicity is that Facebook’s algorithm promotes groups to people it identifies as having similar interests.“One swinger joins sperm donors’ group and Facebook advertises it to all his mates over in Big Women for Desperate Losers,” she jokes. “These guys hide in the background, private messaging new members and sending [dick pics], getting off talking to women about the process.“Some will go so far as to appear genuine and arrange to meet but it’s nothing more than a fantasy to them. For the women who jump in, they get taken in by those and the scammers.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These prolific donors can quickly become minor celebrities in the sperm-donation universe.Men in their 20s and 30s, particularly from the US, appear to travel the world making money from selling sperm. They also cash in on influencer content on Instagram and TikTok, uploading videos about their lives and advising women how to get pregnant.View image in fullscreenUsing online sperm sellers carries risks of sexually transmitted diseases and hidden genetic disorders.Photograph: Motortion/Getty ImagesTheGerman sperm donor influencer Daniel Bayen, who recently visited the UK, is one such influencer. The 25-year-old’s videos, filmed all over the world, preach openness and transparency about being a prolific donor. He answers questions from followers and talks about the rapport he builds with families he donates to, and the “pride” he feels when he sees pictures of his biological children – though he will not give any indication of how many he has.Bayen was conceived through donated sperm himself and has about 30 half-siblings. He says he uses a homemade “sibling registry” to keep track of his biological children and has a Facebook group where the parents can meet.Whether Bayen’s approach is ethical is hotly debated in the groups, and he and others like him are criticised for leaving a trail of possibly hundreds of legally untraceable siblings and thousands of first cousins.UK women driven to unregulated sperm donors by high treatment costs, experts sayRead moreIt is a problem often ignored by the adults in these communities who are so keen to have a baby: the tangled genetic backstory their children will have to unpick later in life if they want to know where they came from. This is especially the case if they do not want to risk starting a sexual relationship with a close biological relative – a genuine hazard, especially when recipient families live close to each other.In one of the sadder posts in the Sperm Donors UK group, one woman enquires about her child’s potential siblings.“How do I find out about the other babies born from his sperm?” she asks. “Obviously there’s no sperm bank with information available as I found him in here. I could message him but I really don’t want to. Is there any other way I can find other families?”She adds: “Any advice welcome I know there were 10 families in total and we all conceived in the same year I believe, also I remember him saying one lady was expecting twins.”More than a dozen respondents say variations of the same thing: “You can’t.”Explore more on these topicsSperm donationParents and parentingFertility problemsHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They were interested in doing a master’s degree in New York, so we’d booked a two-week stay in the Big Apple on the way to London.We arrived at the postgrad residence, a big 10-storey building on the Upper West Side called International House which had been set up by Rockefeller to house postgraduate students. We dropped our bags and went straight to the canteen, where we grabbed food, took a seat and started talking to other diners.Sitting next to me was an Iraqi man studying engineering atColumbia University. He asked me what I did, and I told him that I’d just graduated with a science degree and had been doing some research using an electron microscope at CSIRO.He said there was an electron microscope unit at Columbia University – right next door to the engineering department, which was how he knew about it. He told me I should apply for a job with them. I laughed it off, telling him that I was about to fly to Europe and, much more critically, I didn’t have a US visa.The kindness of strangers: a gang of scary-looking youths stepped in to save me from being muggedRead moreThe next day I went out exploring, returning to the canteen that night. The Iraqi student walked up to me and told me he’d arranged an interview for me with the head of the electron microscope unit at Columbia. Because he’d gone to the trouble of setting it up, I went to the interview – but straight away told my interviewer that I didn’t have a visa, so I was probably wasting her time.In typical New York fashion – a city where anything feels possible – she said: “We can make that happen. When can you start?” I never got on that flight to London.I worked there for three years. A perk of the job was that I also received free tuition at Columbia, and I used the opportunity to complete a master’s of international affairs.I never saw that student again and I don’t even know his name, but his incredible act of kindness changed my life in so many ways. I would never have had the courage or confidence to approach someone at an Ivy League university and ask for a job. And I had always wanted to study abroad, but could never have afforded it without that free tuition.Perhaps most importantly, that gig at Columbia led me to a job in Zurich where I met my beautiful French husband, with whom I now have four amazing children. It was a total sliding doors moment. That kind stranger set me on a different course in life, and I’m forever grateful.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceWhat's the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?From making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

But inNew York, on Tuesday night,Zohran Mamdani, the first Muslim mayor of New York, and an immigrant from Uganda, chose to underline his identity. “New York will remain a city of immigrants: a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants and, as of tonight, led by an immigrant,” he told an ecstatic crowd at Paramount theater in Brooklyn.The son of a Muslim father and a Hindu mother, he was born in Kampala, raised inNew York, and identifies as a democratic socialist. Almost every aspect of Mamdani’s identity had been an issue of contention during the election. Earlier this week, the Center for Study of Organized Hate published a report highlighting the surge in Islamophobic comments online between July and October, most of which labelled Mamdani as an extremist or terrorist.Two days before the election, a Super Pac supporting Andrew Cuomo had run an ad depicting Mamdani in front of the Twin Towers crashing down on 9/11. Earlier, it had artificially thickened and enlarged Mamdani’s beard to make him appear more menacing on a flyer circulated around the city. Towards the end of October, a tearful Mamdani had addressed these accusations in a moving speech in the Bronx. He vowed that as an immigrant, and especially as a Muslim: “I will no longer be in the shadows.”23:03Zohran Mamdani, elected mayor of New York City, full victory speech – videoOn Tuesday night in Brooklyn, he drove that point home: “I am Muslim. I am a democratic socialist. And most damning of all, I refuse to apologize for any of this.”Minhaj Khan, who works with the Indian American Muslim Council of North America, a New Jersey organisation that focuses on the tri-state area, told me what “Zohran offers is something different than any other Muslim candidate who fought an election anywhere in the United States: he took a pretty bold stand against the ill that is spoken aboutIslamand Muslims in this country and his boldness actually resonates a lot with the community right now.”Mamdani’s mayoral race was marred by unhinged Islamophobia. It’s not going away soon | Arwa MahdawiRead more“I think the way that he is not diminishing his identity and all the parts of his experience that have driven him to be pushing his affordability platform is huge,” said Alina Shen, the organising director of CAAAV Voice, the sibling organisation of Committee Against Anti-Asian Violence, which played a crucial part in engaging South Asian residents of the city in Mamdani’s campaign. “I think it’s part of what made him stand out as a political candidate, that he’s not changing who he actually is.”Mamdani also started his victory speech by quoting Eugene Debs, the American socialist who was the son of French immigrants, and borrowed the hopefulness for a new dawn in New York City from Jawaharlal Nehru’s famous address to Indians on the eve of the country’s independence: “A moment comes, but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance.”Khan, who moved to the US from India in the 1990s, said he was “proud” to hear Mamdani quoting Nehru from the podium. “Nehru was a man who brought everyone together,” Khan told me. “At the time of partition, it was a very vicious environment in India, and in that moment, Nehru stood up as a secular leader, brought people together.”In Khan’s eyes, Mamdani offers something similar: “Zohran’s campaign has shown how you can bring together Jews and Muslims and Hindus and Christians in this highly divisive time in this country.”View image in fullscreenZohran Mamdani stands on stage with his wife Rama Duwaji, his father, Mahmood Mamdani, and mother, Mira Nair.Photograph: Yuki Iwamura/APMamdani’s own parents are both children of the Nehruvian age of Indian democracy, steeped in the ideas of pluralism.His father Mahmood Mamdani, a scholar of colonialism and a professor at Columbia University, was born to Gujarati Muslim parents in Mumbai. But he grew up in Kampala,Uganda, and first came to the United States on a scholarship to study at the University of Pittsburgh and became involved in the civil rights movement; he was among the students arrested for travelling to Montgomery, Alabama, from northern universities during the bus boycott led by Martin Luther King Jr.After finishing his master’s at Tufts University, Mahmood moved back to Uganda, only to be expelled from his adopted country as part of Idi Amin’s expulsion of the Indian diaspora, ending up at a refugee shelter behind the Kensington Palace in London. In the 1980s, Amin’s successor, Milton Obote stripped Mahmood of his Ugandan citizenship for criticizing government policies. His status as a thinker and writer only rose, culminating in a tenured professorship at Columbia University, where he continues to work today.The celebrated filmmaker Mira Nair, Zohran’s mother, was born in Orissa, on the other side of the subcontinent from Mumbai, in a family of high-ranking bureaucrats. While in her teens, she turned down a full scholarship to Cambridge University – the scars of British colonialism were still fresh in the Indian psyche – and instead went to attend Harvard. She spent her summers in New York city among the artists and writers, developing an affinity for theater and films. Her first forays into filmmaking explored the lives of residents of Old Delhi, an Indian newspaper dealer in New York, and strippers and street-children of Mumbai.I think that Zohran’s platform ... is about shifting the terrain of power in this countryIrene HsuIt was while researching her second feature film, Mississippi Masala, which follows the lives of Ugandan Indians displaced by Idi Amin, that Nair first met Mahmood, as part of her research. In 1991, the same year the film was released, the couple got married, and had a son: Zohran Kwame Mamdani, who got his middle name in honour of Kwame Nkrumah, the Ghanaian revolutionary who became the country’s first president.Zohran spent the first five years of his life in Kampala, living in a bungalow overlooking Lake Victoria, where part of Mississippi Masala was shot. In a 2002 profile of Nair in The New Yorker, he was introduced as “Nair’s talkative doe-eyed son, Zohran, who exudes the charm of the well-loved, [and] is known by dozens of coinages, including Z, Zoru, Fadoose, and Nonstop Mamdani”.Like his father, Zohran lived an itinerant childhood. After his father moved to New York in a faculty apartment close to Columbia University, Zohran, leaving behind Kampala, was enrolled in the private Bank Street School in Manhattan. Evenings were spent in Riverside Park. At home, dinner guests included Columbia scholars like Edward Said and Rashid Khalidi, close friends of his father. For high school he went to a selective public school in the Bronx, and attended college in Maine, graduating in Africana Studies in 2014.Zohran’s first meaningful brush with the desperation among the city’s working-class families came during his work as a foreclosure prevention and housing counsellor in Queens. During the 2016 presidential election, he was inspired by the campaign of Bernie Sanders, which focused on costs-of-living, affordability and healthcare. Those same issues would go on to become the bedrock of his mayoral campaign. At a town hall in Brooklyn with Sanders this September, Zohran said it was Sanders’s campaign that first exposed him to the language of democratic socialism. During his term as the representative of New York’s 36th state assembly district, his most notable work was with the taxi drivers in the city.We’re not afraid of the money or the establishment anymoreFaidra TzedakisAt a time when immigrants around the country are feeling increasingly threatened under theTrump administration, as masked agents of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) stalk the streets of American cities, harassing, arresting and deporting immigrants, Zohran’s campaign has cultivated a sense of hope among the community.“We are an organization made up of immigrants,” Irene Hsu, communications and media manager at CAAAV, said. “The people who work with us, they’re cooks, they’re restaurant workers, they’re cab drivers, they’re home care workers, they’re students, they’re teachers, they’re parents, they’re elderly folks who have retired from working jobs as construction workers. It’s all these people who really run the city. And I think that Zohran’s platform, which is their own platform, is about shifting the terrain of power in this country.”From scapegoats to city hall: how New York Muslims built power and shaped Zohran MamdaniRead moreOn Tuesday night, as the results started to trickle in, Faidra Tzedakis, who moved to New York from Greece in 2014, went to a watch party organised by the Democratic Socialists of America in Astoria, Queens. Tzedakis became a US citizen during the summer and has been grappling with what that means.“The previous generation had the American Dream of this nice big house with a fence, and a stable nine-to-five job and that, kind of, has died,” said Tzedakis, who grew up amid the economic crisis in Greece. “It doesn’t really exist anymore.”“I think this campaign just proves that immigrants and younger people and educated people have a voice, and there’s hope: like we can change things,” she said. “So I think that the new dream is that we would live in a world where our leaders speak up and stand up for reproductive rights, against genocides, against Islamophobia and antisemitism, and do their best to protect marginalized groups like undocumented immigrants.”“We’re not afraid of the money or the establishment anymore,” she said. “And we can create a world that is just more accepting, and, yeah, loving.”Explore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniNew YorkDemocratsUS politicsUS immigrationDonald TrumpTrump administrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Searches for those still missing had to be suspended on Sunday due to safety concerns for rescue workers.At least two deaths from Typhoon Fung-wong were recorded before landfall on Sunday. The civil defence office reported that one person drowned in Catanduanes and a woman was trapped by a collapsed home in Catbalogan City. Juniel Tagarino, a rescuer in Catbalogan City, said the body of the 64-year-old woman, who had been trying to leave, had been pulled from under debris and fallen trees.“The wind was so strong and the rain was heavy … According to her family members, she might have forgotten something and went back inside her house,” Tagarino said.Graphic showing expected track of typhoonThe biggest typhoon to threaten the Philippines in years, Fung-wong could cover two-thirds of the archipelago with a 1,118-mile-wide rain and wind band, forecasters have said. Tropical cyclones with sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h) or higher are categorised in the Philippines as a super-typhoon, a designation adopted to underscore the urgency tied to more extreme weather disturbances.Scientists have said storms are becoming more powerful due to the human-driven climate crisis. Warmer oceans allow typhoons to strengthen rapidly and a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, meaning heavier rainfall.More than 1.2 million people have been pre-emptively evacuated across the country, Rafaelito Alejandro, a civil defence deputy administrator, told a news briefing.Typhoon Fung-wong is expected to bring at least 200mm (8in) of rain to many parts of the country, according to government meteorologists. It is the 21st significant storm to hit the Philippines this year, straining disaster response efforts across the country.It blew into Dinalungan town in Aurora province on Sunday night after fierce rain and wind in north-eastern Philippine provinces all day from offshore.In Aurora province, Aries Ora, 34, a government worker, said the rain was still light as he boarded up his home in the town of Dipaculao with steel sheets and wooden boards during daylight hours before landfall, but he said he feared the dark. “What really scares us is that the expected landfall is at night,” he said. “Unlike previous typhoons, we won’t be able to clearly see the movement of the wind and what’s happening around us.”Schools and government offices have been ordered to close on Monday across Luzon, including in the capital, Manila, where nearly 300 flights have been cancelled.View image in fullscreenRescuers evacuate people in Sablayan, Occidental Mindoro province.Photograph: APGilberto Teodoro, the defence secretary, urged people in the storm’s path to obey evacuation orders, saying that to not comply was dangerous and unlawful.“We ask that people pre-emptively evacuate so that we don’t end up having to conduct rescues at the last minute, which could put the lives of police, soldiers, firefighters and coastguard personnel at risk,” he said.Earlier on Sunday, Catanduanes, a small island that the state weather service said could take a direct hit, was already being lashed by wind and rain, with storm surges sending waves hurtling over streets and flood waters rising in some areas.The Guardian view on worsening extreme weather: the injustice of the climate crisis grows ever clearer | EditorialRead moreAlejandro said: “As we speak they are feeling the impact of the typhoon, especially in Catanduanes, because the storm’s eye is closest there.”Edson Casarino, 33, who lives in the town of Virac in Catanduanes, said: “The waves started roaring around 7am. When the waves hit the seawall, it felt like the ground was shaking.”Video from officials in Catanduanes, shared by the government broadcaster, showed houses submerged up to the roofs.“The rain and wind were so strong there was nearly zero visibility,” Roberto Monterola, a disaster mitigation officer for Catanduanes, told the Associated Press by telephone.In Guinobatan, a town of about 80,000 people in Albay province, verified video showed streets transformed into raging torrents.View image in fullscreenAn area affected by Typhoon Fung-wong in Catanduanes province.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockPope Leo offered prayers for the predominantly Catholic nation. “I am close to the people of the Philippines affected by a violent typhoon.

If native title were granted, it would recognise the Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung’s rights to access, use and protect land in line with their laws and customs, along with the right to be consulted.Native title is only applied to crown land and does not affect private homes, businesses or public infrastructure. As such it has limited scope within metropolitan areas.The Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung people are hoping to negotiate the transfer of management, or involvement in the administration, of some parks and conservation areas within the claim area. These could include parts of the Dandenong Ranges, Bunyip state park, Wombat state forest and Lerderderg state park.There are six other native title applications before the federal court in Victoria, which collectively encompass most of the state.A Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung elder, Perry Wandin, said when native title claims were launched, “everyone thinks we’re coming after their properties”. But he said their aim was actually to work in conjunction with government and communities to look after and restore the land.“Wurundjeri people have fought for decades for recognition and respect and have been at the forefront of protecting culture and country in Melbourne and surrounds,” he said.“The courts have recognised seven other groups in Victoria.

Living through extreme weather events had only a small effect on concern about climate change, it found.“People have ways of explaining it away, or attributing it to natural factors, or are … unwilling to blame climate change for their misfortune,” Hamilton said.Prof Iain Walker, a social psychologist at the University of Melbourne who was not involved in the survey, said that finding was consistent with other research both from Australia and internationally, which suggested that “experiencing extreme weather events makes little difference, and what difference it does make is likely short-lived”.“I think the explanation to the counterintuitive effect lies in how people interpret the weather event,” Walker said. “People who already accept anthropogenic climate change will accept a flood or heatwave as more evidence that climate change is happening; those who already reject climate change will explain away the extreme weather events.”Though the areas the survey identified as affected by extreme weather events were outside capital cities, it found that concern about the climate crisis was somewhat higher in cities than regional areas.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisAustralian politicsLabor partyCoalitionAustralian GreensnewsShareReuse this content"

Poland has been hit by a wave ofarson and other sabotage attacksthat involve one-time operatives on the ground and are believed to be run by Russian intelligence operatives.Later, Rogov’s wife, Irina Rogova, was also arrested, and the couple were accused of cooperating with the FSB to inform on other Russian opposition activists.Poland has arrested numerous people on charges of preparing or carrying out sabotage on behalf of Russia over the last two years. Many are Polish, Ukrainian or Belarusian citizens believed to have been recruited via Telegram for one-time paid jobs. Rogov’s case is unusual in that he is a Russian citizen and appears to have been in direct contact with the FSB for some years.The Guardian obtained an anonymised copy of the indictment against Rogov and his wife from the Polish court. In accordance with local laws, he is referred to only as Igor R, but exiled Russian media outlets and other sources have identified the defendant as Rogov.The files suggest a long history of cooperation with the FSB. Rogov admitted to interrogators that he had been approached by the security service several years ago while still in Russia and coerced into infiltrating the local branch of an opposition movement.He said he was given a burner phone and sim cards to contact his FSB handler, and when “cooperation reached a higher level” he had in-person meetings at an unmarked apartment near the local FSB headquarters. “At that time, he also began to receive money in exchange for cooperation,” according to the indictment.Rogov told his wife he had been recruited by the FSB, according to the indictment, which quotes her as saying he “probably received money for this, because he was not working at the time but he had money”.Later, in Poland, Rogov asked his wife to help him transfer to his handlers an encrypted USB stick with reports on Russian activists and others in Poland who might be of interest to the FSB. He gave her the USB stick to take on a visit to Russia hidden in a package together with souvenirs from Poland, and an address to post it to.Details from the indictment were previously published by the Polish outlet Wirtualna Polska, which also said Rogov had been blackmailed by the FSB to cooperate when in Poland, with the threat that if he did not, his father would be conscripted to serve in the Russian army.Leonid Volkov, of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, said he could not recall ever meeting Rogov but that the case demonstrated typical methods used by the Russian authorities.“This is not surprising. The FSB has always done this, still does it and will carry on doing so: finding young people with vulnerabilities, recruiting them and then sending them into opposition organisations,” he wrote on X.Another part of the case against Rogov deals with a package that he was reported to have handled. The package contained the components of an explosive device and was addressed to Rogov, although he never received it. He said he had agreed to receive the package as a favour to a friend. A Ukrainian woman was also arrested over the package but has since been released.Since 2022, Poland has made it hard for Russians to get visas, with exceptions made only for those in extreme humanitarian need or those such as Rogov with a background in opposition movements.The first hearing in the trial of the Rogovs is due to take place on 8 December.Additional reporting by Ada PetriczkoExplore more on these topicsPolandRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In New York they enter the shadow world of “Bad Bridgets” – sex workers, thieves, drunkards and killers.Peppiatt and his Kneecap producer Trevor Birney optioned the historians’ book, Bad Bridget: Crime, Mayhem and the Lives of Irish Emigrant Women, and will collaborate with Robbie’s production company,LuckyChap.The Oscar-winning production designer James Price and the costume designer Kate Hawley will work on the film which is to begin shooting in Ireland andNorthern Irelandnext year.“I’d like to think we’ll have loads of influence over the film, but I suspect not,” said Farrell. “It’s slightly scary because you’ve got your set ideas as historians, we think of things in particular ways. So there’s a bit of letting go.”View image in fullscreenIrish emigrants sailing to the US during the Great Famine, 1850.Photograph: Illustrated London News/Getty ImagesMcCormick said they had trustedPeppiatt, a former tabloid reportergarlanded for Kneecap, his semi-autobiographical film about the rap trio of that name. “We’ll leave the film up to Rich. He is the expert and he has amazing ideas so we’re really looking forward to seeing how it turns out.”The original academic project, funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, unpicked the conventional narrative that female Irish emigrants were domestic servants, cooks, wives and mothers with reputations for diligence and rectitude.In the 1860s, Irish people made up about a quarter of New York’s population but Irish men comprised half of the male prison population and Irish women 86% of the female prison population. A survey of 1,238 foreign-born sex workers in the city found that 706, just over half, were Irish.The research uncovered individual stories, such as that of Ellen Price, who was described as appearing in a Toronto court in 1865 “drunk as usual, with a flaming red feather in her hat”. Led away to prison, she launched into a chorus of Rocky Road to Dublin.Margaret Brown, a pickpocket known as Old Mother Hubbard, tried to escape from a Chicago prison in 1877 by tying bedsheets together but fell and was badly injured. Lizzie Halliday, originally from County Antrim, was convicted of multiple murders and became the first woman sentenced to die in New York’s electric chair, but the sentence was commuted on grounds of insanity.Fans of the book and podcast, which has just launched a second season, valued learning about this side of the Irish emigrant experience, said Farrell. “It wasn’t all good wives and mothers and nuns or teachers. There’s a slightly darker side. I don’t want to meet those women but I love that we can see their strong attitudes and their defiance.”The historians hope aspects of their “favourite Bridgets” will end up on screen but in the meantime they will continue researching and teaching. “The talk of premieres and all that is really exciting but we still have to do our day jobs,” said McCormick. Even so, they could dream of glitz, Farrell joked. “That’s our main concern, you know, what we’ll wear for the red carpet.”Explore more on these topicsPodcastsIrelandWomenMigrationHeritageEuropeNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

The applicant’s contract must be reclassified as a permanent contract.”Baraka said he had “filed this case because of the injustice” he suffered.“During the first days of the war inGaza, I was, like all other residents of Gaza, facing an unknown and frightening fate,” he said.“When I was offered evacuation by the EU to a safe place, as an EU employee who had served for 20 years, I accepted the offer. But had I known that my fate would be dismissal from my job and being left in a place with no residence or basic human rights, I would have never agreed to it. None of this was explained to me beforehand.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Flights were disrupted at Brussels and Liège airports last Thursday after unidentified drone sightings, which were also reported at military bases and nuclear facilities in the country.Russia has been identified as the most likely culprit, the latest in a string of incidents across northernEuropethis autumn. However, Knighton said even without knowing definitively who was behind the drone flights, he was “very happy” to act in support of a Nato ally.Germany announced last week it had sent specialist assistance, and Belgian authorities said France had followed suit. The UK’s help is expected to come from the RAF’s dedicatedcounter-uncrewed aerial systems unit.Last week Boris Pistorius, the German defence minister, said he believed the drone incursions were “likely connected with the fight over the use of Russian frozen assets held by Belgium”. EU and UK politicians have been discussing how to release Russian central bank assets, held mostly in Belgium, to support a €140bn (£120bn)loan to Ukraine.Knighton was speaking in his first television interviews as chief of defence staff since he took over from Adm Sir Tony Radakin in September. A former head of the air force, he led military tributes to fallen soldiers at the Cenotaph in London on Sunday morning after the king and prime minister.Knighton said in an interview with the BBC that “Russia is the most pressing threat right now” and the UK needed to strengthen itself against “hybrid warfare, this warfare that’s below the traditional threshold”, including threats from cyber and in space, sabotage, and assassination plots on British soil.In an interview with Sky News, Knighton acknowledged that the UK armed forces had been “hollowed out” after 30 years of cuts since the end of the cold war. “We know that we have gaps in things like weapons stockpiles. We know that we don’t have all the people that we need,” he said when asked to elaborate.UK defence spending is expected to increase from £62.2bn this year to £71bn in 2027-28, in line with a plan to lift the total military budget to 2.6% of GDP during this parliament. But money has been limited because of restricted budgets in previous years, internal overspends, and a heavy focus on new equipment rather than day-to-day costs.Knighton said he was “confident the armed forces are a safe place for women” because of changes implemented after the suicide ofGnr Jaysley Beck, 19, who killed herself in 2021 after she was sexually assaulted by a senior colleague and bombarded with texts and voice messages by another line manager.At the beginning of November, Beck’s mother, Leighann McCready, said women should not join the army because they were not properly protected in a male-dominated environment. “They protect themselves and not the soldiers,” she said.Describing it as “a horrible case,” Knighton said: “I can understand why Jaysley Beck’s mother has said that. What happened to Jaysley was entirely unacceptable. It was criminal. She was let down.”He said since then the military had made changes, including introducing an independent defence serious crimes unit and a victim and witness care unit. He said victims were able to choose whether accusations of crimes such as rape and serious sexual assault were handled in the military or civilian courts.Explore more on these topicsMilitaryRoyal Air ForceBelgiumDrones (military)RussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Esmaeilian said consumption in the city had reached about “8,000 litres per second, of which about 1,000 to 1,500 litres per second is supplied from the dams”.Authorities in Tehran warned over the weekend of possible rolling cuts to water supplies in the capital amid what officials call the worst drought in decades. The Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has cautioned that without rainfall before winter, even Tehran could face evacuation.In the capital, five major dams supplying drinking water are at “critical” levels, with one empty and another at less than 8% of capacity, officials say.“If people can reduce consumption by 20%, it seems possible to manage the situation without rationing or cutting off water,” Esmaeilian said, warning that those with the highest consumption could face supply cuts first.Nationwide, 19 major dams – about 10% of the country’s reservoirs – have in effect run dry, Abbasali Keykhaei of the Iranian Water Resources Management Company said in late October, according to Mehr news agency.The water crisis in Iran follows months of drought across the country. Over the summer, authorities announced public holidays in Tehran to cut back on water and energy consumption as the capital faced almost daily power outages during a heatwave.On Sunday local newspapers attacked what they described as the politicisation of environmental decision-making for the water crisis. The reformist Etemad newspaper cited the appointment of “unqualified managers … in key institutions” as being the main cause of the crisis.Shargh, another reformist daily, said: “Climate is sacrificed for the sake of politics.”Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It added that it had received supportive feedback from many of its 22,200 members.Dr Bradley Hillier, a consultant forensic psychiatrist and a signatory to the letter, said: “I am really quite disturbed that the Royal College of Psychiatrists is seemingly entering a business relationship with a [state] that has significant challenges around human rights. It seems so evidently in conflict with the college’s position and values and its history.”Hillier added that it was hard to envisage how mental health issues relating to gender dysphoria, HIV status or experiences of homophobia would be navigated. The exams involve candidates carrying out mock consultations with actors playing the role of patients and are designed to assess how a doctor would perform in a real-world setting.The college said the content and delivery of the exam in Doha would meet the same standards, values and scrutiny as exams held in the UK and Singapore, and would include competency in addressing mental health problems experienced by LGBTQ+ patients.Prof Annie Bartlett, professor of offender healthcare at City St George’s University, London, said she welcomed the college expanding international access to its exams, but added: “There are lots of countries that you could have chosen that would avoid issues of women’s rights, migrant workers and the death penalty on the statute for certain same-sex practices.”“I think it’s a mistake,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Only then can we overcome any, and all challenges in an uncertain world.”Amrit Kaur Dhatt, Maj Singh Dhatt’s granddaughter, said: “It is so important to capture stories of Commonwealth and ethnic minority soldiers, like my grandfather’s, because they were left out of mainstream history.

That all changed on Sunday, when Tim Davie and Deborah Turnessboth quittheir jobs.Davie oversaw no shortage of scandals during his five years as director general – in recent months these included rows over aGaza documentaryandGlastonburycoverage – and was nicknamed “Teflon Tim” by BBC insiders because nothing seemed to stick.But this week, it did.Odd, though, that the trigger for this crisis was a largely forgotten report by the Panorama programme, broadcast more than a year ago, about the US election.The BBC is facing a coordinated, politically motivated attack. With these resignations, it has given in | Jane MartinsonRead moreThe Daily Telegraph, never a friend to theBBC, was leaked a report by Michael Prescott, a former adviser to the BBC committee overseeing editorial standards.Prescott’s report suggested Panoramaedited a Donald Trump speechso it looked as if he had explicitly encouraged the Capitol riots.Prescott accused the corporation of “serious and systemic” bias in its editorial coverage. Perhaps predictably, parts of the right immediately leapt on the report.Boris Johnson told the Telegraph that Davie “must either explain or resign”. The Tory party leader, Kemi Badenoch, said “heads should roll”. The story was picked up in the US, where the White House described the BBC as “100% fake news” and a “propaganda machine”.Senior BBC insiders were dismayed.Aware of the crucial role the corporation plays in national life, they have admitted to genuine concern about the proclivity for big editorial errors. But they have also had deeper fears: that the attacks are part of an ongoing political and ideological campaign by those who want to undermine the organisation.Yet the government has had concerns of its own over the BBC.Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, said on Sunday – before the resignations – that she had “countless conversations with the senior leadership, too many to name, and far more than I would like” since the election. There appeared to be have been little trust between her and Davie.‘I have to take ultimate responsibility’: Tim Davie’s BBC resignation statementRead moreNandywarned that there was “a very, very dangerous environment in this country where people can’t trust what they see”. BBC News – with its huge reach at home and abroad – plays a key role in challenging disinformation in the increasingly polarised media landscape.It is because of this that Nandy is understood to privately share the concerns of many BBC staff that some of the attacks on the corporation are politically orchestrated – and that there has been a dearth of figures at the top of the organisation who can successfully navigate culture wars.Many inside government – and across the progressive parties – share the view that, for all its faults, the public service broadcaster’s role in preserving democracy, which is under threat from the rise of the populist right, is vital.“The BBC isn’t perfect, but it remains one of the few institutions standing between our British values and a populist, Trump-style takeover of our politics,” the Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, said on Sunday.Yet whatever politicians think of the BBC, its fate lies with the public, and whether the British people have confidence in its future. Ultimately, that depends on fair and accurate reporting, free from political or ideological bias – from either side.The BBC regularly comes out top in UK media trust rankings. Yet the latest row comes at a particularly sensitive time, with the government due to review its royal charter before the current term expires in 2027.Senior government insiders hope to use the charter review process to “future proof” the BBC by putting in place structures that protect its independence – but also to make sure the corporation is more accountable.It will have to be for the BBC to repair the broken trust with politicians, with some of its own journalists and – crucially – with parts of the public.Explore more on these topicsBBCTim DavieLisa NandyanalysisShareReuse this content"

This is entirely my decision, and I remain very thankful to the Chair and Board for their unswerving and unanimous support throughout my entire tenure, including during recent days.I am working through exact timings with the Board to allow for an orderly transition to a successor over the coming months.I have been reflecting on the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times, combined with the fact that I want to give a successor time to help shape the Charter plans they will be delivering.In these increasingly polarised times, the BBC is of unique value and speaks to the very best of us. It helps make the UK a special place; overwhelmingly kind, tolerant and curious. Like all public organisations, the BBC is not perfect, and we must always be open, transparent and accountable. While not being the only reason, the current debate around BBC News has understandably contributed to my decision. Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as Director-General I have to take ultimate responsibility.Our organisation is a critical ingredient of a healthy society, as well as a thriving creative sector. We should champion it, not weaponise it.Despite a hugely competitive market, I am proud that the BBC remains the most trusted news brand globally. We have continued to ensure that it is used by almost everyone in the UK as well as hundreds of millions of people globally. Despite the inevitable issues and challenges, our journalism and quality content continues to be admired as a gold standard. Our transition to a digital organisation has been deeply impressive, and our thriving commercial businesses are admired globally. Also, our work together on ensuring that we have the right culture has been important and motivating. I could not be more impressed by what you are achieving.You will ask why now, why this moment?I am BBC through and through, having spent the last 20 years of my life working for this organisation as Director of Marketing, Communications and Audiences, Director of Audio and Music, acting Director-General and Chief Executive of BBC Studios. I care deeply about it and want it to succeed. That is why I want to create the best conditions and space for a new DG to come in and positively shape the next Royal Charter. I hope that as we move forward, a sensible, calm and rational public conversation can take place about the next chapter of the BBC.This timing allows a new DG to help shape the next Charter. I believe we are in a strong position to deliver growth.Thank you again, it has been a wonderful ride, which I have loved. I count myself very lucky to have served as DG no.17. I will have a proper chance to see many of you before I go but I have been incredibly proud to lead the BBC as DG for over five years. It is a precious UK institution and you are a world-class team. Thank you all for the tireless support and friendship.I will always be a passionate cheerleader for civilised society, a strong BBC and a thriving UK.Best wishes,TimDeborah Turness, who has been the CEO ofBBCNews since January 2022, sent the following statement to staff:Dear all,I have never been more proud of the work that you do every day. You really are the best of the best.I have taken the difficult decision that it will no longer be my role to lead you in the collective vision that we all have: to pursue the truth with no agenda.The ongoing controversy around the Panorama on President Trump has reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC – an institution that I love.As the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me – and I took the decision to offer my resignation to the Director-General last night.In public life leaders need to be fully accountable, and that is why I am stepping down. While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong.In a polarised world, BBC News journalism is more vital than ever, and I could not be prouder of the work that you do. Together we have bucked the global trend, to grow trust in BBC News, and I want to thank you, wherever you are in the world, for your courageous work to deliver that.My plea to you: please keep the courage to continue our mission. I’m only sorry that I won’t be there to lead and champion your brilliant journalism.It has been a great privilege to work with you all.I will now work with Tim to plan an orderly handover to ensure that my decision to step away causes the least disruption possible to the important work that you do.With very best wishes,DeborahExplore more on these topicsTim DavieBBCThe news on TVnewsShareReuse this content"

Insiders say it ‘feels like a coup’ by broadcaster’s enemiesBBC bias row: how a week of hostile headlines from rightwing media led to resignationsMichael SavageMedia editorSun 9 Nov 2025 14.35 ESTFirst published on Sun 9 Nov 2025 13.07 ESTShareTim Davie, the BBC’s director general, and the head of BBC News have resigned after a former adviser to the corporation accused it of “serious and systemic” bias in its coverage of issues including Donald Trump, Gaza and trans rights.In an announcement that caused shock within the corporation, Davie said his departure was “entirely my decision” and it comes as the BBCprepares to apologisefor the way it edited a Trump speech.Deborah Turness, the head ofBBCNews, has also resigned. Sources within that department described a mood of dismay at Turness’s exit. “It feels like a coup,” one said. “This is the result of a campaign by political enemies of the BBC.”It is a huge moment for the corporation, as it heads into critical talks with the government over its future and funding. The hunt is now on to fill two of the biggest roles in British media.The BBC is facing a coordinated, politically motivated attack. With these resignations, it’s given in | Jane MartinsonRead moreThe Commons culture, media and sport select committee had set a Monday deadline for the BBC to respond to the claims made by Michael Prescott, a former independent external adviser to its editorial guidelines and standards committee. He left that role in the summer.Prescott criticised the editing of Trump’s speech in an edition of Panorama, which spliced together clips from an address the US president made on 6 January 2021. The edit suggested Trump told the crowd: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you, and we fight. We fight like hell.”The words were taken from sections of his speech almost an hour apart. The incident has led tocriticism of the BBC by Karoline Leavitt, Trump’s press secretary, who described the corporation this weekend as “100% fake news” and a “propaganda machine”.Last night, Leavitt appeared to celebrate the departures, referring on X to her complaints about the BBC’s treatment of the US president’s speech.Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that “very dishonest people” had “tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election”, adding: “On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for democracy!”Tim Davie: the marketing man who became the BBC’s director generalRead moreIn a note to staff, Davie said he had retained the “unswerving and unanimous support” of the BBC’s board and its chair, Samir Shah, throughout. However, he said the current accusations had contributed to his decision.“Like all public organisations, the BBC is not perfect, and we must always be open, transparent and accountable,” he said.“While not being the only reason, the current debate around BBC News has understandably contributed to my decision. Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director general I have to take ultimate responsibility.”Davie’s departure comes after a torrid year in which the BBC has been criticised over the comments of its former presenter Gary Lineker, the livestreaming of a Glastonbury festival performance of the rap punk duo Bob Vylan, and criticisms over a Gaza documentary.The departures of Davie and Turness appear to be an attempt to protect the BBC from further attacks following Prescott’s criticisms, which he made in a letter to the BBC’s board.View image in fullscreenDeborah Turness said: ‘In public life leaders need to be fully accountable, and that is why I am stepping down.’Photograph: Richard Kendal/RTS/PAShah said Davie’s departure was a “sad day” for the BBC. “He has had the full support of me and the board throughout,” he said. “However, I understand the continued pressure on him, personally and professionally, which has led him to take this decision today. The whole board respects the decision and the reasons for it.”The Prescott letter, which was passed to the Daily Telegraph, also condemned BBC Arabic for using contributors who had expressed antisemitic views. It included the views of a contributor who had previously stated online that Jews should be burned “as Hitler did”. The BBC has previously said he should not have been featured in the way he was.Another featured contributor had described Jews online as “devils”. The BBC said in May that the person had been barred from being a contributor in future.The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, had said she was confident that Shah and Davie were “treating this with the seriousness that this demands”.In her departure note to staff, Turness said: “The ongoing controversy around the Panorama on President Trump has reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC – an institution that I love.“As the CEO of BBC News and current affairs, the buck stops with me. In public life leaders need to be fully accountable, and that is why I am stepping down.”However, she used her departure statement to push back on Prescott’s allegations of general bias at the corporation. “While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong,” she said.The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said the corporation needs “to turn a new leaf”, the Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, called for “top-to-bottom” reform and Reform UK’s leader, Nigel Farage, said it was the BBC’s “last chance”.While many BBC figures believe Prescott’s letter refers to some genuine errors, there is also concern it is being used by its political opponents.Some BBC figures point to an effort to shift the corporation politically,dating back to Boris Johnson’s time in government. The Guardian has been told Prescott’s appointment as an external adviser had been pushed by the BBC board member Robbie Gibb, Theresa May’s former communications chief who helped set up the rightwing broadcaster GB News.Gibb was first placed on the BBC board during Johnson’s time in government. Gibb and Prescott have previously been reported as being friends. Gibb was on a four-person interview panel that appointed Prescott.Johnson told the Guardian that any suggestion of an attempt to undermine the BBC was “complete and utter bollocks”. Prescott said in his letter that his criticisms “do not come with any political agenda”.Explore more on these topicsTim DavieBBCnewsShareReuse this content"

That business merged with Shop Direct in 2004.David Barclay died in 2021.However, the Barclay family’s fortunes appear to have worsened in recent years. Theylost control of the Telegraph newspapersafter the family struggled to repay large loans.Carlyle first became a lender to the Very Group in 2021 with a loan of undisclosed size. The investor followed that up in 2024 with about £85m out of a £125m debt package. Carlyle’s total financing to the business is thought to be more than £500m.Abu Dhabi-based investment fund International Media Investments (IMI), which also lent to Very, is expected to remain a lender.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Washington DC area has strong Democratic support, while Trump’s cuts to the government have affected many workers in the vicinity of the Commanders’ stadium. Sunday was not the first time Trump has received a hostile reception from a Washington sports crowd: he wasgreeted with ‘lock him up’ chantsat the Washington Nationals’ home stadium during the 2019 World Series.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.bsky.app. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as the provider may be using cookies and other technologies.

He then got in his armored car for the drive to the arena.Can Donald Trump really make an NFL team name its stadium after him?Read more“We’re gonna have a good game. Things are going along very well. The country’s doing well. The Democrats have to open it up,” he said – a reference to the government shutdown.In the first quarter Sunday, before the president arrived, Lions receiver Amon-Ra St Brown celebrated a touchdown catch by doing the “Trump dance”,which athletes started performing last year.“I heard Trump was going to be at the game,” St Brown said after the game. “I don’t know how many times the president’s going to be at the game, so just decided to have some fun.”Lions quarterback Jared Goff said he had enjoyed seeing the flyover from the president’s plane. “Awesome that he was here,” Goff said.Fox then gave the president nearly 10 minutes of airtime as he joined the broadcast booth, spoke about his high school football career and called some of the action in the third quarter. Asked how he thought the country was doing, the president answeredsomewhat dubiouslythat prices are going down for Americans. He also admitted he had not scored any touchdowns in high school, saying: “At least you realize I never tell a lie.”Trump is just the third sitting president to attend an NFL game during the regular season, according to the league, after Richard Nixon in 1969 and Jimmy Carter in 1978. Trump became the first president to attend a Super Bowl while residing in the White Housewhen he watchedthe Philadelphia Eagles beat the Kansas City Chiefs in February.According to a report by ESPN on Saturday, an intermediary for the White House has told the Commanders’ ownership group that Trump wants the club’s new stadium – part of a nearly $4bn project in the nation’s capital at the site of what was known as RFK Stadium –to bear his name.“They’re going to build a beautiful stadium. That’s what I’m involved in, we’re getting all the approvals and everything else,” Trump said during his Fox appearance. “And you have a wonderful owner, Josh [Harris] and his group. And you’re going to see some very good things.”Sunday’s visit was the latest in a series of high-profile appearances at sporting events by Trump, includinggolf’s Ryder Cup, auto racing’s Daytona 500 andtennis’ US Open.“We are honored to welcome President Trump to the game as we celebrate those who have served and continue to serve our country,” Commanders president Mark Clouse said. “The entire Commanders organization is proud to participate in the NFL’s league-wide Salute to Service initiative, recognizing the dedication and sacrifice of our nation’s veterans, active-duty service members, and their families this Sunday.”Trump was presumably unimpressed with the Commanders’ performance as they went down to a 44-22 defeat – he left the game early.Explore more on these topicsNFLWashington CommandersUS sportsDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Earlier this year, Republican senator Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced a bill proposing$600 in tariff rebatesfor nearly all Americans and their dependent children.“Americans deserve a tax rebate after four years of [Joe] Biden [White House] policies that have devastated families’ savings and livelihoods,” Hawley said at the time. He said the legislation would “allow hard-working Americans to benefit from the wealth that Trump’s tariffs are returning to this country”.However, US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said in August that the administration’s main focus remains reducing the national debt, which stands at $38.12tn, using funds from tariff collections. He said the money would be used first to start paying down the federal debt –not to giverebate checks to Americans.According to the treasury department’s September report,$195bnin customs duties were collected during the first three quarters of the year.Though, it appears that the cost of giving out $2,000 checks could easily surpass the amount actually collected from the tariffs. According to calculations, these payments would cost close to if not more than double the amount that has reportedly been generated so far.“If the cutoff is $100,000, 150M adults would qualify, for a cost near $300 billion,” wrote Erica York, vice-president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, onsocial media. “If kids qualify, that grows.”“The math gets worse accounting for the full budgetary impact of tariffs”, York added. “Adjusting for that, tariffs have raised $90 billion of net revenues compared to Trump’s proposed $300 billion rebate.”John Arnold, co-chair of Arnold Ventures,estimatedthat the dividend payments could cost as much as $513bn.As of October, consumers were paying an average effective tariff rate of nearly 18%, the highest since 1934, according to data from theYale Budget Lab. Since the president introduced widespread tariffs on global trading partners in April, companies have passed part of those costs on to consumers.This isn’t the first time Trump has floated the idea of giving Americans stimulus checks based on revenue from his tariffs. In October, he said that he was considering offering Americans checks from the revenue, worth somewhere between $1,000 and $2,000. In July, the president again suggested that the government might consider tariff rebate checks.In February, he and tech mogul Elon Musk, who at the time was still advising the White House, said they wereconsideringthe idea of a $5,000 “dividend” check based on savings generated by the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge). These payments never came to be as the national deficit actually increased under Doge, and the amount cut from federal spending was significantlyexaggerated.The US supreme courtheard argumentson Wednesday on Trump’s sweeping global tariffs and appeared skeptical of their legality.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The White House often seems to believe two opposing policies can work together while one policy can do two or three contradictory things.A heavy dose of hocus pocus will be needed to make the administration’s dollar policy work in the interest of the United States, for it appears that they want to end the US dollar’s supremacy in global finance.At least some part of it does. True,Donald Trumphas warned countries not to replace the dollar,or else. And, reportedly, some members of the administration want to encourage more countries toadopt the dollaroutright. But what is also true is thatStephen Miran, the president’s chief economic adviser, on leave to act as board member of the Federal Reserve, thinks the dollar’s position as the main reserve currency of the world is an undue burden for the US and a principal driver of the large trade deficit that Trump findsso odious.“America runs large current account deficits not because it imports too much,” Miranwrote last year. Rather, it imports too much because it must export Treasury bonds to provide other countries with assets in which to park their reserves. This leads to “persistent dollar overvaluation that prevents the balancing of international trade.”The quote brings to mind Jenny Holzer’s 1980s Times Square billboard, with its dry appeal to a higher power: “protect me from what I want.”It is not impossible that Trump & Co. could effectively debase the dollar. They could do it through policy choice or sheer incompetence. Arguably, they have already started. They will not like the outcome.For sure, foreign countries will suffer if US Treasury bonds quit their job as safe liquid assets in which to park reserves. There are no good alternatives out there. The old hope that the euro would rival the dollar has been stymied by Europe’s fragmented capital markets. A quarter century from the euro’s launch there is no euro T-bond. The renminbi, meanwhile, can’t play a leading role in global finance while China retains capital controls that keep money from freely flowing in and out.The dollar is valuable not only as a financial haven. A recentresearch paperpoints out that roughly two thirds of countries in the world stabilize their currency against the dollar to provide insurance against global economic shocks. Because the US market is so large, the value of the dollar affects the price of traded goods: shocks that appreciate the dollar also raise their price. Holding dollars or, indeed, aligning one’s currency with the dollar – can help hedge against these economic fluctuations.The cost of undermining the dollar to the US would also be enormous. For starters, it stands to lose world influence, alongside its main tool for economic coercion, which allows it to limit enemies’ access to the financial system. Moreover, the US would relinquish what former French president Valery Giscard d’Estaing called the US’s “exorbitant privilege”.Miran is not wrong that the dollar’s reserve status draws a lot of money into Treasury bonds. But that is a gift. It allows the government to fund itsmassive debt– 120% of GDP – at a low interest rate. The privilege also implies that the USearns moreon its holdings of foreign assets than foreigners earn on their US holdings. Indeed, curbing the US current account deficit would be much more difficult if the US lost its reserve status because its interest rate edge would shrink or disappear altogether.Which brings us to the question, will Trump knock the dollar off its perch? Its supremacy has been eroding. These days it accounts for 58% of global foreign exchange reserves, down from 74% at the turn of the century. The interest rate advantage Treasury bonds have over the debt ofcorporationsorother countrieshas shrunk over time.And Trump’s trade war will reduce the dollar’s insurance powers. By curbing US imports, Trump’s tariff wall will dampen the relationship between the dollar and the price of traded goods–reducing its value as a hedge against economic shocks. “We’re basically reducing the impact that we have on the world market, and by reducing the impact that we have on the world market, we also reduce the dollar safety property,”notes Tarek Hassanof Boston University.And that gives countries and investors less of a reason to peg their currency to the greenback or hold dollar assets. Hassan estimates that the tariffs imposed so far have raised US interest rates by half a percentage point, a not-irrelevant amount given that rates are in the 3-4% range. Developing countries have beenswapping out of dollar debtin recent months, turning to currencies with lower interest rates like the Swiss franc and the renminbi.The notion that the president’s trade war might undermine the dollar’s pre-eminence struck hard on“Liberation Day”in April when Trump first announced his round-robin “reciprocal” tariffs. US stocks, bonds and the dollar plunged in unison, like risky emerging market assets, breaking the ironclad rule of modern finance that shocks to the system, whether coming from the US or some faraway developing country, benefit Treasury bonds and the dollar as the world’s safe haven, where governments, investors and regular people park money in times of unrest.Markets have calmed down since then. Investors appear to have forgiven Trump for theincoherent policymaking. Maybe it’s because Trump ultimately walked back many of the tariffs. But blood is in the water. The odds that the Treasury bond will lose its primacy as the world’s safest asset are looking shorter.Who knows what that would entail? Other currencies might fill some of the slack. Europe’s joint effort to rearm, for instance, could open an opportunity for euro-wide bonds to rival US Treasury bonds in other countries’ foreign exchange reserves. But insurance against economic and financial shocks will likely become more expensive. Global welfare will surely suffer.Trump & Co might at first applaud a cheaper dollar, which would likely translate into a smaller US trade deficit. The cheers, however, are unlikely to last. This would come, for the US, at an exorbitant cost.Explore more on these topicsUS economyEconomicsDonald TrumpDollarEuroCurrenciesTrump administrationanalysisShareReuse this content"

Drax, Britain’s single biggest source of carbon emissions, has receivedbillions of pounds in subsidies from burning biomass derived largely from wood.The report, byStand.earth, a Canadian environmental non-profit, claims that a subsidiary of Drax Group received hundreds of truckloads of whole logs at its biomass pellet sites throughout 2024 and into 2025, which were likely to have included trees that were hundreds of years old.The report could raise fresh questions for the owner of the North Yorkshire power plant, which has been forced in recent years to defend its sustainability claims while receiving more than £2m a day in green energy subsidies from UK bill payers.The report’s findings suggest that the power plant was burning “irreplaceable” trees even as its owners lobbied the UK government for the additional green energy subsidies,which were granted earlier this week.View image in fullscreenLogs at the Burns Lake plant. Drax has been forced to defend its sustainability claims.Photograph: Desiree Wallace/Stand.earthThe company has claimed that it sources wood only from “well‐managed, sustainable forests” to manufacture the pellets that are shipped from its sites in Canada and the US to be burned at its UK power plant.But these claims have been questioned by Britain’s energy regulator andthe Financial Conduct Authorityafter a BBC Panorama documentary in 2022 reported that Drax had cut down primary forests in Canada to turn into wood pellets.The latest investigation into the company’s green credentials, seen by the Guardian, uses official data from the government of British Columbia, along with satellite monitoring, to back claims that a Canadian subsidiary owned by Drax sourced 250-year-old trees to manufacture biomass pellets as recently as this year.‘Old-growth’ forests at riskThe report claims that the company received 90 truckloads of logs sourced from “old-growth forests” in the Skeena region of British Columbia, home to some of Canada’s largest undeveloped wilderness areas.Old-growth forests are defined by the local government as areas that include trees older than 250 years in slow-growth ecosystems, or older than 140 years in ecosystems in which trees are replaced more quickly.Drax said in October 2023 it had stopped sourcing wood from areas designated by the government of British Columbia as “protected” or “deferred” old-growth forest stands, but it did not dispute that it was still sourcing wood from other sites containing old growth.Responding to the Stand.earth report, a spokesperson for Drax said: “Our sourcing policy means Drax does not source biomass from designated areas of old growth and only sources woody biomass fromwell-managed, sustainable forests.”These designated areas of old growth amount to less than half of the total old-growth forest areas in British Columbia. Figures from the BC government show that designated areas total 5.3m hectares, while the total area of old-growth forest in the province spans 11.1m hectares. Another 3.7m hectares are protected under separate designation schemes.Stand.earth claims that in 2024 and 2025 Drax received at least an additional 425 truckloads of whole logs from “cutblocks” – areas of forest land designated for timber harvesting – which contained old-growth forests.The report claims that 63 of these loads came from three cutblocks that contained more than 90% old-growth forest, “meaning that this purchase almost certainly contained old growth”.It added that the remaining 362 lorry loads of whole logs came from 22 cutblocks in the Skeena region that were more than 80% old growth, meaning that it was “likely” they contained old growth.“The true volume of old growth sourced by Drax is likely higher than what our research was able to track, because of spatial data limitations,” the report said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With how logging works here in BC, there isn’t really a way for Drax to be operating in these areas and not include old-growth forests in their wood supply. The people of the UK should know that the risk of old-growth trees being cut down to produce wood pellets is higher than ever,” Hansen said.As part of the investigation, Hansen visited a biomass pellet production site, owned by a Canadian subsidiary of Drax, where the company’s reliance on whole logs was apparent.“It was quite stark. The yards are sprawling and there were huge piles of logs there. These were large, healthy trees of different ages. We saw some trees which had been scorched by fire, but they were still alive when they were cut, which was apparent by the oozing sap,” she said.View image in fullscreenStand.earth says that Drax received 425 truckloads of whole logs from ‘cutblocks’ that contained old-growth forests.Photograph: Desiree Wallace/Stand.earthDrax said the “low-grade” wood used to make biomass pellets had typically been rejected by commercial sawmills and either sold to the biomass industry as waste wood or burned to prevent wildfires. A spokesperson said it was “far better to use [waste wood] to generate renewable electricity rather than leaving it to burn”.The rules that allow companies in the forestry industry to disregard old growth as commercial waste are part of the problem, Hansen said.“Even exceptionally old trees can rot in the middle, which is one of their features that makes them so important for wildlife, but could mean the tree is called defective by the logging industry. This could mean that the tree is dismissed as waste wood. But a tree standing up in a forest is not waste,” she said.“Drax has come into British Columbia claiming to solve some of the problems that our forestry industry has, but they have not. It’s very disheartening, and offensive, to hear Drax claiming to be solving these problems when really they’re entrenching some of the problems that we have in forestry here,” Hansen said.Quick GuideContact Guardian Business about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Prosecutors allege claim that Ortiz was paid $5,000 for throwing an intentional ball during a game on 15 June. His teammate Clase, a three-time All-Star, is alleged to have been given $5,000 for facilitating the rigged pitch, alongside gamblers in the players’ home country of the Dominican Republic. Prosecutors claim the pair did so again in a game on 27 June, receiving $7,000 each.The NBA jumped into bed with gambling. Now the league is getting its dueRead moreESPN’s Jeff Passan reportedthat Ortiz was arrested in Boston on Sunday, while Clase has not yet been taken into custody.“MLB contacted federal law enforcement at the outset of its investigation and has fully cooperated throughout the process. We are aware of the indictment and today’s arrest, and our investigation is ongoing,” Major LeagueBaseballsaid in a statement on Sunday.The pair face up to 65 years in prison if found guilty of the allegations, which include charges of fraud, conspiracy and bribery.Ortiz earned $782,600 in salary last season while Clase, one of the league’s best closers, was paid $4.5m.

The Washington DC area has strong Democratic support, while Trump’s cuts to the government have affected many workers in the vicinity of the Commanders’ stadium. Sunday was not the first time Trump has received a hostile reception from a Washington sports crowd: he wasgreeted with ‘lock him up’ chantsat the Washington Nationals’ home stadium during the 2019 World Series.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.bsky.app. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as the provider may be using cookies and other technologies.

He then got in his armored car for the drive to the arena.Can Donald Trump really make an NFL team name its stadium after him?Read more“We’re gonna have a good game. Things are going along very well. The country’s doing well. The Democrats have to open it up,” he said – a reference to the government shutdown.In the first quarter Sunday, before the president arrived, Lions receiver Amon-Ra St Brown celebrated a touchdown catch by doing the “Trump dance”,which athletes started performing last year.“I heard Trump was going to be at the game,” St Brown said after the game. “I don’t know how many times the president’s going to be at the game, so just decided to have some fun.”Lions quarterback Jared Goff said he had enjoyed seeing the flyover from the president’s plane. “Awesome that he was here,” Goff said.Fox then gave the president nearly 10 minutes of airtime as he joined the broadcast booth, spoke about his high school football career and called some of the action in the third quarter. Asked how he thought the country was doing, the president answeredsomewhat dubiouslythat prices are going down for Americans. He also admitted he had not scored any touchdowns in high school, saying: “At least you realize I never tell a lie.”Trump is just the third sitting president to attend an NFL game during the regular season, according to the league, after Richard Nixon in 1969 and Jimmy Carter in 1978. Trump became the first president to attend a Super Bowl while residing in the White Housewhen he watchedthe Philadelphia Eagles beat the Kansas City Chiefs in February.According to a report by ESPN on Saturday, an intermediary for the White House has told the Commanders’ ownership group that Trump wants the club’s new stadium – part of a nearly $4bn project in the nation’s capital at the site of what was known as RFK Stadium –to bear his name.“They’re going to build a beautiful stadium. That’s what I’m involved in, we’re getting all the approvals and everything else,” Trump said during his Fox appearance. “And you have a wonderful owner, Josh [Harris] and his group. And you’re going to see some very good things.”Sunday’s visit was the latest in a series of high-profile appearances at sporting events by Trump, includinggolf’s Ryder Cup, auto racing’s Daytona 500 andtennis’ US Open.“We are honored to welcome President Trump to the game as we celebrate those who have served and continue to serve our country,” Commanders president Mark Clouse said. “The entire Commanders organization is proud to participate in the NFL’s league-wide Salute to Service initiative, recognizing the dedication and sacrifice of our nation’s veterans, active-duty service members, and their families this Sunday.”Trump was presumably unimpressed with the Commanders’ performance as they went down to a 44-22 defeat – he left the game early.Explore more on these topicsNFLWashington CommandersUS sportsDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Tagovailoa completed 15 of 21 passes with two interceptions to give him a league-leading 12 picks this season. It was also the most dominant performance of the season for Miami’s defense, which had three takeaways and three sacks. Josh Allen threw for 306 yards and two touchdowns, with an interception and fumble, but was replaced by Mitchell Trubisky after Achane’s second TD put the Dolphins up by 17 with three minutes left.Jacksonville Jaguars 29-36 Houston TexansDavis Mills delivered a trio of fourth-quarter touchdowns to help the Houston Texans erase a 19-point deficit and rally for victory over the visiting Jacksonville Jaguars (5-4).

Stafford has been a key player, with 20 touchdown passes and no interceptions in the past six games.Detroit Lions 44-22 Washington CommandersJared Goff threw three TD passes and Jahmyr Gibbs found the end zone three times to help the Detroit Lions earn a bounce-back win over the Washington Commanders in front of Donald Trump. Dan Campbell’s Lions do not lose consecutive games and the head coach seemingly took over play-calling Sunday to rebound after a defeat last time out.With Trump watchingfrom a suite after arriving late in the first half – making him the first sitting US president at a regular-season NFL game since 1978, and just the third ever – the Lions scored the first 22 points and never looked back. Washington have lost five games in a row.New York Giants 20-24 Chicago BearsCaleb Williams threw a touchdown pass and scrambled for a go-ahead score in the fourth quarter, helping the Chicago Bears beat Jaxson Dart, who left the game with a concussion, and the New York Giants (2-8). Led by Williams, Chicago scored the last 14 points after Younghoe Koo’s 19-yard field goal gave New York a 20-10 lead with 10:19 left. CJ Gardner-Johnson had two sacks for the 6-3 Bears, including one of Russell Wilson on a key third down in the final period. Williams sparked the rally with a two-yard touchdown pass to Rome Odunze, making it 20-17 with 3:56 left.Atlanta Falcons 25-31 Indianapolis Colts (OT)Jonathan Taylor completed a 244-yard rushing day with a touchdown run in overtime to give the Indianapolis Colts (8-2) victory over the Atlanta Falcons (3-6) in the first regular-seasonNFLgame in Berlin. It was Taylor’s third touchdown of the game and came after Colts kicker Michael Badgley tied the game with a 44-yard field goal with 25 seconds left. Tyler Allgeier’s second touchdown was a one-yard plunge that give the Falcons a 25-22 lead with 1:44 left in regulation.Arizona Cardinals 22-44 Seattle SeahawksThe Seattle Seahawks dominated the first half on the way to a convincing win over the Arizona Cardinals. DeMarcus Lawrence returned two fumbles for touchdowns in the first half. He became the sixth player since at least 1991 with at least two defensive TDs in a half. Seattle led 38-7 at halftime and cruised from there to improve to 7-2. The Cardinals fell to 3-6. Sam Darnold threw a TD pass to Jaxon Smith-Njigba on the Seahawks’ first possession. The NFC West-leading Seahawks beat their division rivals for the ninth straight time, and this one was hardly competitive.New England Patriots 28–23 Tampa Bay BuccaneersTreVeyon Henderson had touchdown runs of 69 and 55 yards, Drake Maye threw two TD passes, and the New England Patriots beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for their seventh straight win. After Maye threw an interception in the end zone, the Patriots (8-2) made a big stop on fourth-and-three at their own 27. Henderson then sealed the win with his 69-yard TD run. The rookie finished with a career-high 147 yards rushing on 14 carries. The Buccaneers were the first team in NFL history to have each of their first four wins of the season come on a game-winning score in the final minute of regulation. They had a chance to do it again when Tykee Smith intercepted Maye’s pass from the 2 in the end zone with 5:17 left.Baltimore Ravens 27–19 Minnesota VikingsLamar Jackson completed 17 of 29 passes for 176 yards and a touchdown, and the Baltimore Ravens finished strong to secure a win over the Minnesota Vikings. Justice Hill rushed for a touchdown and Mark Andrews hauled in a touchdown pass for Baltimore (4-5), who won their third game in a row after a four-game losing streak. Derrick Henry had 20 carries for 75 yards. JJ McCarthy completed 20 of 42 passes for 248 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions for Minnesota (4-5). The Ravens outscored the Vikings 18-9 in the second half to grab the lead and secure the win. The Ravens turned three takeaways into 13 points. Meanwhile, the Vikings committed eight false-start penalties.Cleveland Browns 20–27 New York JetsNew York got touchdowns on a kickoff return and a punt return in the same game for the first time in franchise history, Breece Hall took a screen pass from Justin Fields 42 yards for the go-ahead score and the Jets held on to defeat the Cleveland Browns.Five days after tradingAll-Pro cornerback Sauce Gardner and defensive tackle Quinnen Williams, the Jets came off their bye-week break to win their second game in a row. Kene Nwangwu returned a kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown in the first quarter, and Isaiah Williams brought back a punt 74 yards for a score. Will McDonald had four sacks to tie a Jets single-game record. The result leaves both teams at 2-7 this season.New Orleans Saints 17–7 Carolina PanthersRookie Tyler Shough earned his first win as an NFL starting quarterback, throwing for 282 yards and two touchdowns as the New Orleans Saints (2-8) beat the Carolina Panthers (5-5) to snap a four-game skid. Shough connected with Chris Olave and Juwan Johnson for long touchdowns, and Alvin Kamara ran for 83 yards for the Saints. New Orleans outgained Carolina 388 yards to 175.

It was Manchester City who cleared their throats and made it plain that they are in this race for the long haul. Liverpool barely got a word in.The table looks a lot more appealing for Pep Guardiola and his players now, City only four points behind Arsenal, and it was an occasion when they blewLiverpoolaway. They could shrug off the inconvenience of Erling Haaland missing a controversially awarded 13th-minute penalty to put on a show of strength, particularly in the first half.Manchester City 3-0 Liverpool: Premier League player ratingsRead moreIt was Haaland, inevitably, who opened the scoring with his 19th City goal of the season and, after Nico González had benefited from a deflection off Virgil van Dijk in first-half stoppage time, the scene was set for the coup de grace.Jérémy Doku was almost unplayable, a blur of tricks and direct running and his goal for 3-0 was a beauty, a quick move inside before the perfectly executed curler with his right foot into the far corner. He merited the ovation he got when he was substituted towards the end.Liverpool cried foul over two decisions – both driven by the video assistant referee, Michael Oliver. They got away with the penalty when Giorgi Mamardashvili kept out Haaland’s kick but the sickener was when Van Dijk had a header for 1-1 ruled out after a corner. Andy Robertson was in an offside position close to Gianluigi Donnarumma and it mattered not that the City goalkeeper looked unlikely to make the save. It was a real letter of the law call.View image in fullscreenErling Haaland’s opening goal against Liverpool came after the Norwegian striker had seen an early penalty saved.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIt was not the reason why Liverpool lost. City were slicker and more incisive; they carried the greater physical threat, too. It was difficult not to fear that Liverpool’s title defence has ended here and not only because they trail Arsenal by eight points. It was the manner in which they fell to a fourth away league defeat in succession for the first time since 2012. There had been no little fanfare after their midweek Champions Leaguewin over Real Madrid. They were back. Not on this evidence.Guardiola was lauded for his 1,000th game as a manager beforehand, City screening an extended and effusive tribute to him on the big screen, and it was then on to trying to unpick another of his tactical setups. Because the fluency, the positional interchanges of his midfielders, was really something.City brought intensity from the first whistle, Doku marauding from the left, popping up all over. Bernardo Silva sat alongside González one minute and pushed high or wide the next. He would control the tempo. Guardiola consistently seemed to have the extra man in midfield. Nico O’Reilly caused problems from left-back when he was not doing a defensive number on Mohamed Salah.The touchpaper was lit by the penalty decision, the referee, Chris Kavanagh, advised by Oliver to study the replays of the moment when Doku appeared to bulldoze through Ibrahima Konaté before slicing back from the byline and seeing Mamardashvili come flying out at him. The contact was minimal – one of those where you had to look very hard from a specific angle to discover it – and, if it was technically there, it did not disguise the reality that the award was soft.City did not relent after Mamardashvili’s save. Doku shimmered with menace. It was the skills, the pace, the strength; the complete package. Rayan Cherki had a shot blocked by Konaté and the breakthrough had been advertised. Liverpool were in danger of being run off the pitch. It was remarkable to see how many one-on-one duels they lost before the interval; how they plodded without inspiration.Haaland’s goal for 1-0 was strange, albeit the buildup was lovely. Konaté appeared to get a little flick to Matheus Nunes’s cross from the right with Haaland airborne behind him. But the striker still managed to loop the header back into the corner of the net. How much did he know about it? Then again, it was Haaland.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The ball just had to take a decisive flick off Van Dijk.Slot had stuck with his back-to-basics approach, the same lineup – broadly – that he played in the victories against Aston Villa and Real that had given Liverpool optimism in the buildup. The key detail was that it was the midfield three from the title-winning season last time out, with Florian Wirtz on the left of the front three. Wirtz had a few flickers, City having to resort to some roughhouse stuff to stop him.Quick GuidePlay our new game: On the ballShowThe Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles withthe launch of its first daily football game, On the ball.

They were better, even if the bar was low. Ryan Gravenberch almost released Salah, Rúben Dias forced into a saving challenge as Donnarumma made a reckless bolt from his area. González nearly put through his own goal while Cody Gakpo, on as a substitute for the anonymous Hugo Ekitiké, blazed over when well placed.Doku kept coming. He enjoyed himself, the alarm bells ringing for Liverpool whenever he got on the ball. His goal was the showstopper. Dominik Szoboszlai would work Donnarumma with a piledriver while Salah touched narrowly wide of the far corner in a one-on-one.

Yet after another masterclass in Brazil he defied the odds in taking third from a 19th-place start in the pit lane. It was an extraordinary drive, even as Lando Norris delivered a perfect weekend with a win at Interlagos and in so doing staked a claim to having one hand on the title.Norris’s victory was without doubt that of a champion in waiting as he managed a tense and high‑pressure victory from pole position to extend his world championship lead over his McLaren teammate,Oscar Piastri, who finished fifth. Norris gave a performance of precision and control exactly when it was required to put real daylight on his two title rivals.Lewis Hamilton laments ‘nightmare’ first season driving for FerrariRead moreYet Verstappen, as ever, was irrepressible at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace, where he drove from 17th to victory last season and is now the scene of two of his best drives. With Verstappen andRed Bullhaving found the pace that eluded them all weekend after taking a new engine and employing a new setup after a dire qualifying, he scythed through the field with verve and dash that was a joy to watch.Every opening he went for he made, even as he made three pit stops, including an early one for a slow puncture. He had to come back from 19th at the start then 18th after his first stop and yet his rise through the field appeared inexorable.Norris matched him with the controlled drive required to convert his pole and in so doing now has the whip hand. After scoring the maximum possible points with victories in the sprint and the GP, Norris has a 24‑point advantage over Piastri while Verstappen is 49 points behind, with 83 points still to race for in the final three meetings at Las Vegas, Qatar and Abu Dhabi.The turnaround for Norris, with his seventh victory this season, has been extraordinary since he was 34 points behind Piastri after the Dutch GP in August – a period when his credentials as a world champion and whether he had the steel to fight for it were being questioned. They were opinions he felt he had answered emphatically when asked on the reasons for his recent form.“Just ignore everyone who talks crap about you and focus on yourself,” he said. “There’s not a long way to go but it can change so quickly, like we’ve seen today. So, just focus on myself, keep my head down, ignore everyone and keep pushing.”View image in fullscreenRed Bull’s Max Verstappen came from the pit lane to finish third.Photograph: Amanda Perobelli/ReutersFor all that Verstappen played centre stage with a captivating soliloquy, Norris’s performance drives the narrative: a decisive moment in the title race given that Piastri endured another blow to his hopes. Starting from fourth he took an early 10‑second penalty for causing a collision when he locked up and hit Kimi Antonelli at turn one. Although he delivered a strong performance to recover, the damage was done.Piastri might feel aggrieved that he was not at fault as he made a legitimate move up the inside and that Antonelli had not given him enough space, but he has been on the back foot all weekend. He crashed out in the sprint race while Norris completed the full monty of pole and victory in both disciplines.Drivers’ standingsAfter taking pole on Saturday Norris had acknowledged that he had addressed weaknesses in his performances this season and noticeably was now expressing a quiet confidence in how he was driving. Norris can, as he has admitted, be a glass half-empty character, unafraid of self-criticism – so that he now feels he really is on top of his game is telling and was manifest from his control in a tough test in Brazil.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionNorris not only enjoys the lead but, it appears, the same calm assurance Piastri held when he dominated in the early part of the season. As the race ebbed and flowed, a complex challenge marked by varying tyre strategies was made all the more intriguing by Verstappen barrelling about as an excitable stallion as he advanced on the leaders – theMcLarenpit wall and Norris having to factor in a Red Bull that had looked all but irrelevant on Saturday afternoon.Having opted to take the penalty and start Verstappen from the pit lane in an effort to address the setup issues which had left him struggling so badly, Red Bull’s boldness paid off. His pace at times was fearsome, up to a second and half up on Norris, who insisted the world champion remained a player in the title race.“With how quick he was today, he probably would have won if he started higher up.” he said, “He will be a threat, he always is, he is always fighting and will fight to the end. When asked if he could have covered Verstappen’s pace in a straight fight, he gave an unequivocal “no”.It is, nonetheless, Norris who holds all the cards, but Verstappen demonstrated in striking fashionhe really is not quite ready to forget the championship yet.Antonelli took a superb career-best second for Mercedes, with his teammate, George Russell, in fourth and Haas’s Ollie Bearman an excellent sixth. Lewis Hamilton endured another disappointing race, forced to retire his Ferrari after taking floor damage in the opening laps.Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2025Lando NorrisOscar PiastriMax VerstappenMcLarenRed BullFormula OnenewsShareReuse this content"

There are reasons to think he will succeedTom LutzSun 9 Nov 2025 11.40 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Nov 2025 12.35 ESTShareWait, Donald Trump is naming a stadium after himself?That’s ifa well-sourced report from ESPNis to be believed. The US president has apparently let it be known to the ownership group of the Washington Commanders that he wants the team’s new stadium, which is scheduled to open in 2030, to take his name. “It’s what the president wants, and it will probably happen,” a senior White House officialtold ESPN.Presumably Trump, as a serial winner, has chosen the Commanders because they’re the best team in the NFL?Not quite. While the franchise was a dominant force in the 1980s, its last Super Bowl appearance came in the 1991 season. Although the Commanders’fortunes were revived last seasonthanks to new owners and a brilliant young quarterback in Jayden Daniels, their form has slumped again this season.So why would want Trump want to be associated with them?Good point – what would Trump have in common with a team witha dubious history with womenandminorities? Having said that, the move would give Trump two things he enjoys: power and revenge. The NFL is by far the most popular league in America, as well as the richest in the world – having his name on one of its stadiums will make sure he is even more prominent than he already is. It would also be a counterpunch against a league with which Trump has had a fractious relationship. In 1983 he bought a franchise in the rival United States Football League in an attempt to force a merger with the NFL,only to wind up sinking the younger league. In 2014, Trump was frustrated in his attempt to enter the NFL’s inner circle when his bid tobuy the Buffalo Billsfell short. The clashes have continued into his presidency: during his first term, he described NFLplayers protesting against social injusticeas “sons of bitches”. In his second term he has urged the Commanders torevert to their previous racist nicknameandattacked the league’s decisionto choose Trump critic Bad Bunny to play the Super Bowl’s halftime show this season.Trump reportedly wants new NFL stadium in Washington named after himRead moreWill he succeed?This is a man who has already managed to summon up various Trump Towers, Trump Plaza, Trump Steaks, Trump University, Trump Shuttle, Trump Vodka, Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Mortgage and theDonald J Trump Ballroom(to name but a few). Plus, Trump has become adept at getting billionaires to do what he wants of late, while he has found himself givena warmer greeting in the sports worldin his second term as president. The route to naming the stadium is a little tricky but Trump has leverage. As president, he oversees the federal agencies responsible for environmental and land-use approvals at the proposed site of the team’s new stadium, so he could speed up, or slow down, the process if he chose to. “He has cards to play,” one source told ESPN. “He can make it very difficult to get this stadium built unless people align with him on the name.”It should also be noted that the Commanders will not be the ones to name the stadium. The proposed site sits on National Park Service land, and the District of Columbia Council will lease the stadium to the team. Again, Trump can lean on these bodies if he so chooses. “The team doesn’t have the authority. They can’t name the stadium on their own,” a source with direct knowledge of the process told ESPN. “The city would be involved, and the Park Service would be involved.”Are other NFL stadiums named after people?They are, but those people tend to be dead. Two of the most famous stadiums in the NFL – Green Bay’s Lambeau Field and Chicago’s Soldier Field – are tributes to people who have passed away. In Green Bay’s case, the stadium was renamed for the team’s founder and coach Earl “Curly“ Lambeau a few months after his death, while the stadium in Chicago was a tribute to US soldiers who had died in the first world war.Washington’s former stadiumwas named after a politician, but its name illustrates how it differed from Trump’s proposal: the Robert F Kennedy Memorial Stadium was renamed as a tribute to the US senator who was assassinated several months beforehand. It’s also notable that Lambeau and RFK did not lobby to get their names on the stadiums.So which stadiums are named after living world leaders?It should be noted that Trump would –probably– be out of power by the time the new Commanders stadium opens. But you can draw your own conclusions from living leaders who have their names on stadiums.Cameroon’s authoritarian leaderhas the Paul Biya Omnisports Stadium, India’s authoritarian leader has the Narendra Modi Stadium, Saudi Arabia’s authoritarian de facto leader has the proposed Prince Mohammed bin Salman Stadium,while Sierra Leone’s authoritarian leader had the Siaka Stevens National Stadium while he was in power. Hong Kong also went for the Queen Elizabeth Stadium during her reign, but she was a monarch and thereforecompletely different from Trump.Explore more on these topicsWashington CommandersNFLUS sportsDonald TrumpUS politicsexplainersShareReuse this content"

The flip between the dream of driving for this amazing team and then the nightmare of the results that we’ve had. We are just really having to fight through those hardships at the moment.Lando Norris victorious after a thrilling São Paulo Grand Prix – as it happenedRead more“This weekend has been disastrous and disappointing for everyone. I am trying to keep my head above water and remain positive.”In a race won byLando Norristo extend his world championship lead to 24 points from his McLaren teammate, Oscar Piastri, Hamilton once more toiled to little effect. He had qualified in 13th and then early in the race was clipped by Carlos Sainz and shortly afterwards took floor damage when he misjudged an attempted pass on Franco Colapinto.He was forced to retire the car on lap 37, another poor result in a season in which he is sixth in the championship, 66 points behind his teammate, Charles Leclerc, and still without a podium finish.However, the seven-time champion remained resolute that he andFerrariwould find their feet as they focus on next season. “I believe there is something extraordinary up ahead in my life and in my destiny,” he said. “I truly still believe in this team and what we can achieve together. I just have to keep pushing and keep giving them everything I can.”Meanwhile, a punchy Norris has insisted he would ignore critics “talking crap” and attempting to bring him down as he focused only on himself in attempting to close out his first world championship, after victory in Brazil.Norris won at Interlagos with a superb drive from pole position but immediately after the race hit out at questions that had been raised previously regarding his ability to fight for a title. “Just ignore everyone that talks crap about you and focus on yourself,” he said of his approach since he came from behind to retake the lead in the title race.He was the subject of booing at the last round in Mexico and went on to emphasise that he felt he had to cut out the noise that now surrounds the title fight with three races remaining.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s a reminder that a certain major-title drought is not his burden to bearOwen LewisSun 9 Nov 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Nov 2025 04.15 ESTShareIwould like to have some words with ESPN broadcaster Chris Fowler about what he saidafter Novak Djokovic beat Taylor Fritz, for the 11th straight time, in the US Open quarter-finals. Look – Fritz is American, Fowler is American – and sports often lend themselves to nationalism. A little bit of disappointment was appropriate. Instead, Fowler invoked the continued drought of American men at the majors: none of them had lifted a trophy since Andy Roddick in 2003, and Fritz had been the last one standing in the tournament.We all love a narrative, myself included. But comeon.Even if Fritz had beaten Djokovic for the first time, force of nature Carlos Alcaraz was waiting in the next round, who Fritz has yet to beat in an official match. And if he’d somehow survived that, it would have been defending champion Jannik Sinner in the final, against whom Fritz had lost 10 of the last 11 sets. Alcaraz and Sinner had also split the last seven major titles (and Alcaraz went on to thrash a fatigued Djokovic in the next round). Fritz said in press after the loss that he actually liked his draw, because it presented the opportunity to beat the three best players in the world in succession. Fritz is more than within his right to aspire to the accomplishment; an athlete is meant to believe in themselves. But going into that Djokovic quarter-final who else in their right mind had the drought of American champions on the brain?Coco Gauff’s second serve the only thing between her and sustained successRead moreFritz, 28, is ranked fourth in the world entering this week’s ATP World Tour Finals and has won his last six matches over No 3 Alexander Zverev with increasing ease. Presumably he could take that spot for himself in the future. But it’s clear that right now, that’s as far as he can rise: Sinner and Alcaraz lie a chasm of ranking points away. Fritz’s elite serve and concussive power on both forehand and backhand are more than enough to dispose of most opponents on the ATP tour. Against the select few generational talents, though, Fritz is often helpless. The last several years has seen the curious rise of tall, gangly players who can nonetheless cover the court with the alarming speed and fluidity of much shorter men. Fritz is 6ft 5ins and looks it. His movement is stiff, as if he’s still getting used to his legs. So he’ll rarely steal a point that the other player was dictating, and hitting a drop shot against him is usually a safe bet. That serves as a pretty harsh limitation on his potential.Fritz has made a number of dramatic, improbable improvements over the years. At the beginning of the decade, he was circling the bottom of the top 30. Two years later, he was sniffing the top 10. Last year, he suddenly exploded up to No 4 – and held the spot. But the next leap, mixing it up with and beating all-time-greats like Alcaraz, Sinner, and even a declining Djokovic, is the highest of all. What was Fowler thinking? That Fritz, in 2025, was a serious threat to beat them allback-to-back?That it was worth commenting on the ongoing drought of American men lifting major titles when Fritz had departed the US Open in thequarter-finals?The thirst is simply too much andthe respect for the magnitude of the task too little.View image in fullscreenTaylor Fritz made a career-best run to the Wimbledon semi-finals in July.Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty ImagesFritz’s play in that very quarter-final should have been enough of an indication. Djokovic won in four sets, a victory that only felt tenuous for moments towards the very end, when Fritz had survived a couple match points and had a chance to hold for 5-5. The pair looked evenly matched during the rallies, with Fritz earning plenty of opportunities to break. But Djokovic saved break point after break point, prolonging the streak to the point of agony. When Fritz finally did claim one of the opportunities at 5-5 in the second set, he immediately played a horrendous game to drop serve again; Djokovic had lulled him into a skirmish peripheral to the real battle and forced him to use far too much energy to win it. Down match points in the final game, Fritz’s first serve floated to heaven. He prolonged the match twice on his second serve, but finally double-faulted. It wasn’t a choke, I didn’t think, just a result of having to hit too many second serves.The match was fairly ironclad evidence that Fritz is not good enough to beat any version of Djokovic, who lost to Alcaraz in the next round and never particularly appeared like he thought he could win. This is perfectly fine – Djokovic is the best player ever, and may not be at the height of his physical powers anymore, but has developed enough experience and tactical know-how to compensate for quite a bit of the decline. The problem is those who were expecting Fritz to win, and putting pressure on him to do so, when he was yet to do anything that suggested he would.Fritz is an asset to the tour nonetheless. He’s a patient, thoughtful voice in press conferences, more so than virtually anyone on the ATP aside from Daniil Medvedev, willing to not only say how he feels or the tactic he felt decided a match, but explain it. That he should bear the brunt of the blame for America failing to spawn a male major champion since Andy Roddick feels unfair. (Now that Ben Shelton is rubbing shoulders with him in the rankings, perhaps they can share that burden.)Quick GuideATP Finals: singles groupsShowJimmy Connors GroupCarlos Alcaraz (Sp)Taylor Fritz (US)Alex de Minaur (Aus)Lorenzo Musetti (It)Bjorn Borg GroupJannik Sinner (It)Alexander Zverev (Ger)Ben Shelton (US)Félix Auger-Aliassime (Can)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I’d probably think about it forever if I don’t do it,” Fritztold Donald McRaein June of winning a major. I hope he realizes that he’s not a failure if he doesn’t fulfill that goal, that breaking through Alcaraz and Sinner’s young, terrifying empire is in fact extremely improbable for everybody else. Fritz has never been in a position where heshouldhave won a major and didn’t – he lost the lone major final he’s made so far in straight sets to Sinner, and his sem-ifinal berth at Wimbledon this year, his best run besides, ended against Alcaraz in a very tight four sets (with Sinner waiting in the final again). There’s no ghastly choke like Guillermo Coria’s implosion against Gaston Gaudio in the 2004 Roland-Garros final on Fritz’s conscience, no major tournament where he looked like the best player only to drastically underperform.Fritz’s extremely high standards for himself probably account for most of that feeling he expressed to McRae, but I suspect some of it also comes from the stifling, inescapable pressure to be America’s next golden tennis boy. Winning a major is a rare thing, and even rarer in this age of hyper-talented players. Any pressure for Fritz to do so should come entirely from within.Explore more on these topicsTennisUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It has been a special night with my kids here.”Of Doku, Guardiola said: “I think he will never be a top scorer, to be honest, but he’s demanding himself to be better, he listens, and has special attributes of dribbling.

So the first meeting of the two clubs since Oliver Glasner’s sidedid the doubleover their adversaries from down the A23 for the first time since 1933 – before going on to win the FA Cup – was never going to be one for the faint-hearted.But while the streets of south London had the usual heavy police presence for a rivalry that dates back to the days when these clubs were managed by Terry Venables and Alan Mullery in the late 1970s, there wasn’t the same quality to match the passion on display.Sean Dyche’s Nottingham Forest revival gathers pace as fightback sinks LeedsRead morePalace maintained their record of not having lost against Brighton here since March 2019, although Fabian Hürzeler’s team will see this as a chance spurned as they failed to take advantage of opponents who are running on fumes given the extra demands of a Conference League campaign that left them without captain Marc Guéhi.Jaydee Canvot proved to be an able deputy, even if he must have had his heart in his mouth when the referee pointed to the spot in the second half after Georginio Rutter went down. However, the video assistant referee called Tim Robinson to the pitchside monitor and the referee ruled that the forward had dived.“I think he had a very good game but the whole team really defended well,” Glasner said of the France Under-21 international before revealing that Guéhi did not fracture a bone against AZ on Thursday night. “It’s a heavy bone bruise, it’s swollen, he can’t walk, he’s on crutches. I don’t know if England wants to see him. I think if he arrives with crutches, they will send him home.”In the week he was recalled by Thomas Tuchel, Adam Wharton lasted 65 minutes and got the better of another highly rated midfielder in the form of Carlos Baleba, yet neither could have a decisive say. Hürzeler – who, his 59th match in charge, named an unchanged side for the first time – said his players could have snatched the victory. “We had the chances and we were the better team, so therefore you can say it’s a missed opportunity,” he said. “But you can also see from a different perspective that there were a lot of positive things to take away.”View image in fullscreenThe referee Tim Robinson speaks to Jaydee Canvot, who had a penalty given against him for a foul, but which was overturned.Photograph: Katie Chan/Action Plus/ShutterstockThis has been a stop-start campaign for Brighton so far but after a run of three wins in their last fivePremier Leaguegames, their manager admitted in the buildup they were “desperate” to notch up another in an atmosphere that is always frenzied.That was certainly the case in the opening 10 minutes as both sides went on the attack, with Jean‑Philippe Mateta picking up where he left off on Thursday by blazing over inside the opening three minutes. Diego Gómez was flagged offside after forcing Dean Henderson into a save at the other end before a brilliant full-stretch dive from Bart Verbruggen denied a curling effort from Ismaïla Sarr at the end of a flowing Palace move.Quick GuidePlay our new game: On the ballShowThe Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles withthe launch of its first daily football game, On the ball.

Brighton should have at least tested Henderson when they swept downfield in a quick break just before half‑time but Yankuba Minteh dragged his shot horribly wide.Gómez pressed the England goalkeeper into action at the start of the second half when he connected with Minteh’s cross as Brighton sensed an opportunity. Palace also remained a threat but Daichi Kamada could not make it count after Wharton caught Baleba in possession and Sarr picked out the Japan international inside the area.Baleba found his way into the referee’s notebook soon afterwards for fouling Tyrick Mitchell – a decision that was greeted with ironic cheers from the home supporters.Palace came closest to snatching all three points when Yeremy Pino, on as a substitute, forced Verbruggen into a save at his near post in the sixth minute of stoppage time but had to settle for just one after another busy few days.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueCrystal PalaceBrighton & Hove Albionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It is all well and good raising their game for thebiggest Champions League fixturesat St James’ Park, but if they continue to play as meekly as they did against Brentford – just as indefeat at West Hama week earlier and on a concerning number of previous occasions over recent months – those European nights will rapidly become a thing of the past.Two points above the relegation zone is no place for a club of their ambition. “It’s the wrong end of the table for us, but it’s the reality,” Eddie Howe said. That they ended this match with a numerical disadvantage after Dan Burn’s sending off was of little relevance to a defeat that they fully deserved. Harvey Barnes’s goal aside, they were utterly impotent, offering only his solitary shot on target all match.Brentford 3-1 Newcastle, Aston Villa 4-0 Bournemouth and more: Premier League clockwatch – liveRead moreTheir winless away run now stretches to ninePremier Leaguegames, dating back to April. Most worryingly, there was absolutely no sign of it ever ending here. What is this travel malady that so afflicts them when leaving the north-east?“The team has taken a few hits and I think that showed today,” Howe said. “We know we are going to get criticised, we expect that. We know it’s not good enough and I take full responsibility for that – the work to putting that right starts now.“It’s not satisfactory. We haven’t done our jobs and feel we have let everybody down. When you make mistakes it’s not intentional from anyone. All you can do is hold your hands up and say let’s fix it. That’s what we’re going to try and do.”To Liverpool, Manchester United and Aston Villa, Brentford can now add Newcastle to the list of notable clubs they have defeated at home this season. In a game only pockmarked by moments of quality, it was a victory their dominance merited.That they fell behind in the first place was something of a marvel given Newcastle’s lack of threat. Following the visitors’ only truly slick passing move, Barnes picked up the ball just inside Brentford’s penalty area and sent two defenders the wrong way with a wonderful shift of body weight that provided space to drill between Caoimhín Kelleher’s legs.As on their trip to West Ham, they were ahead. And just as occurred then, they promptly conceded three times, Kevin Schade nodding an equaliser and Igor Thiago adding a late double. Newcastle have now dropped more points from winning positions in the Premier League this season than any other side.View image in fullscreenDan Burn brings down Dango Ouattara and is sent off after receiving a second yellow card.Photograph: Adam Davy/PA“Very disappointing that we did get ourselves in a really good position again and we weren’t able to really capitalise,” said Howe. “We were lacking in confidence today. There were a lot of technical mistakes, especially in the middle of the pitch where we’re usually really fluid. That contributed to putting us under pressure. … We know we are good players and have a really good team, but we need to stay grouped together in this difficult period.”There was a sense of inevitability about the manner of Brentford’s comeback. To the hosts’ credit, they had exhibited their ball-playing prowess numerous times without any luck before equalising through a familiar set-piece route.Keith Andrews believes Michael Kayode is the best long‑throw taker he has seen, and the Italian provided the goods yet again for Schade to head home. Since the start of last season, Brentford have now scored more than double the number of Premier League goals from throw‑in situations as any other team.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That Brentford were denied a penalty when Dango Ouattara was first felled by Burn will remain a matter of some bemusement, especially after the video assistant referee suggested replays of the Newcastle defender’s studs nestling into the attacker’s ankle constituted “minimal contact”.

Played in over the top, Ouattara reached the ball first, again, and was brought down by the same Newcastle player. This time, the referee delivered a different verdict: penalty and a second yellow card for Burn.Thiago duly stepped up and stroked the ball past Aaron Ramsdale, who had come off the bench to replace the concussed Nick Pope as part of a quadruple substitution after the penalty had been awarded. Howe confirmed later that Pope will not join the England squad during the international break.With Newcastle all but buried, the Brazilian striker Thiago added an eighth league goal of a brilliant personal campaign after a Malick Thiaw slide tackle diverted the ball straight into his path in injury time.“Second half we were very, very good and hit high levels in every phase of the game, with the ball, without it, the bits in between and set pieces, obviously,” Andrews said. “We were worthy of the win.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrentfordNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Leeds were barely worthy opponents, which is concerning considering the two teams could face a long battle for survival.Lukas Nmecha put Leeds ahead but they quickly withdrew their challenge as Ibrahim Sangaré, Morgan Gibbs-White and Elliot Anderson secured for Forest a firstPremier Leaguevictory in 10 matches, to move them one point off 17th.Late Thiago double earns comeback win for Brentford against 10-man NewcastleRead moreThe final whistle was greeted with a roar inside the City Ground and fireworks outside to show the fuse had been lit. “There’s good signs here and there’s real signs of people committing to the cause, and I always think that’s important,” Dyche said.“Of course every player earns money and all that, what about the commitment to the cause? What about the commitment to each other? Start with each other, the fans and the badge, so they’re important things, and when we get to that, then you know you’re on to some people, we’re going towards that.”Two goals 135 seconds apart were the only two noteworthy incidents of a dreadful first half. Errors played a key part in both. Nmecha’s opener was Leeds’s first real involvement in the clash, coming 13 minutes in. The striker’s finish was clinical after the visitors capitalised on inept defending from Nicolò Savona 25 yards from goal. It was Leeds’s only shot of the first half.It failed to embolden Leeds as they soon relinquished their advantage. Sangaré was quickest to react to Lucas Perri palming a cross out into the box, when holding the ball did not seem difficult. It was the midfielder’s first goal for the club since arriving in 2023 from PSV Eindhoven, opening his account and bringing the match to life with one sidefooted shot.“We should not give away the lead so easily and cheaply,” Daniel Farke said. “Small details are always decisive and there were a few details that were not good enough today.”Without a league win since the opening weekend, Forest needed a reaction against a relegation rival. Dyche’s moulding of the team is becoming more apparent as each game passes. The winger Dan Ndoye operated as an auxiliary right-back when Leeds had possession to try to quell the threat down Forest’s right.View image in fullscreenMorgan Gibbs-White puts Forest ahead with a deft header from Omari Hutchinson’s cross.Photograph: Neal Simpson/Getty Images/AllstarLeeds offered little to no attacking potency throughout the first half. Nmecha, who replaced Dominic Calvert-Lewin in the starting lineup, struggled with the aerial dominance and physicality of Nikola Milenkovic and Murillo, winning very little in the air and without the support to get the second balls.Neither side exuded confidence; Forest repeatedly got into the final third without possessing a clinical final ball into the box, while Leeds were the masters of losing possession with ill-advised passes and running into dead ends. Dyche ensured the channels were hit regularly and Gibbs-White tried to get on the ball in an attempt to create something but was not at his inventive best. “I just want him to keep playing with a smile,” Dyche said of his captain.It felt like an occasion where the players needed to do something to inspire the fans, rather than vice versa amid a City Ground lull. It was quiet as 22 men constantly toiled without producing much to justify the ticket price. Forest are clearly better organised than under Ange Postecoglou but required a cutting edge.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Omari Hutchinson, Taiwo Awoniyi and Ryan Yates were sent on to add guile and workrate with Forest sensing the match was there to be won. Hutchinson swung a perfect cross from the right, which Gibbs‑White flicked into the corner to bring the ground back to life.“He’s been through a tough period recently,” Gibbs-White said of Hutchinson. “He stayed resilient and strong.

The makeshift defender proved his naivety by bundling over Hutchinson inside the box and Anderson did the rest to remove any lasting nerves.“Everyone needed it [the win], I need it as much as everyone else does.

The life of a goalkeeper and all that.But Martínez tends to thrive when in the line of fire and here he pulled off two brilliant saves, including one to deny Antoine Semenyo from the penalty spot. At that pointBournemouthwere pushing to make a comfortable afternoon a little more awkward, before the substitutes Ross Barkley and Donyell Malen added their names to the scoresheet in a 4-0 victory that lifts Villa above Bournemouth in the table. For Andoni Iraola’s side, their first notable off-day of an otherwise fine start. Villa began with five winless games but have now won five of their past six league matches.Brentford 3-1 Newcastle, Aston Villa 4-0 Bournemouth and more: Premier League clockwatch – liveRead moreVilla’s first-half goals were both scored within a couple of yards of the same patch of Villa Park turf, Emiliano Buendía lifting a wonderful free-kick over the Bournemouth wall and past Djordje Petrovic in the visitors’ goal and 12 minutes later Amadou Onana powering a low, precise shot inside the near post. Villa established a two-goal cushion at the interval but the second half always felt dangerous given Bournemouth under Iraola, with nothing to lose, would invariably attack but Villa neutralised their threat.Bournemouth’s left-back Adrien Truffert was fortunate to avoid a second booking for a poor challenge on the Villa captain, John McGinn, typically brilliant in midfield, and a few minutes later they came close to pulling a goal back. Semenyo rampaged towards goal and though McGinn blocked his route, Alex Scott picked up the leftovers and dispatched a first-time shot. A wicked deflection meant Scott’s effort looped high and a back-pedalling Martínez prevented it sneaking under his crossbar with his left glove. Three minutes later Evanilson headed against a post at a corner.View image in fullscreenRoss Barkley heads in Villa’s third goal while under pressure from Bournemouth’s Veljko Milosavljevic.Photograph: Dan Mullan/Getty ImagesMidway through the second half Bournemouth had a clear opportunity to score, Morgan Rogers penalised for handling Evanilson’s header from another corner. Martínez asked the Holte End behind him to turn up the volume and they duly obliged before the goalkeeper dived low to his right and clawed Semenyo’s spot-kick away before Villa cleared for a corner.Unai Emery was a ball of emotion, launching three giant punches into the air towards the Villa fans. Villa added a third when Barkley headed in a Lucas Digne corner and then Malen diverted Youri Tielemans’s shot in off his right boot, though he probably knew little about it. Nevertheless, that did not stop the celebrations and no wonder given the flow of goals; Villa came into this game the joint-second lowest scorers in the division having mustered only nine in their previous 10 matches.Villa have now lost only one of their past 24 home league matches,a 3-0 defeat by Crystal Palacein August. “I am happy, after the poor start, how we are progressively getting better,” Emery said. “We sent the message inside to increase our demands and consistency every day. Every day working, every day. Focusing intensely in each match. We had a fantastic month … we managed to play at a higher level against Tottenham, Man City, Liverpool and Bournemouth. I am so happy.”Quick GuidePlay our new game: On the ballShowThe Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles withthe launch of its first daily football game, On the ball.

The left-back, who scored on his final Arsenal appearance in May, drilled in from 25 yards to double Celtic’s lead six minutes into the second half. It was the 28-year-old’s first Celtic goal since a Europa League win against RB Leipzig on 8 November 2018.Johnny Kenny had opened the scoring in the 10th minute with his fourth goal in four matches under the interim management team of Martin O’Neill and Shaun Maloney. Daizen Maeda missed several good chances forCelticand Kilmarnock hit the crossbar through Bruce Anderson before Tierney struck. The home side struggled to build on the cushion but late goals from Maeda and Arne Engels, from the spot, added a flattering sheen to the scoreline.O’Neill has stated he expects Celtic to make progress on their search for a permanent successor to Brendan Rodgers during this international break, but he remains in the dark. After the victory he said: “I should imagine at some stage or another during the course of the next week that somebody will let me know what’s happening.”When asked if he would consider an extended stay, the 73-year-old said: “I really don’t know. I was going to say, it’s a young man’s game, and I’m almost talking myself out of this here. But it’s been tough. All the things that I kind of thought I knew about it have come to sort of fruition. You know, about the strength of the side, or what I thought I saw from a distance.”Luca Stephenson equalised just before half-time asHeartswere held to a 1-1 draw at home byDundee United. The leaders, who started the day nine points clear at the top, went in front in the 25th minute when Alexandros Kyziridis’s shot rebounded from a post and ricocheted over the line off the United keeper Yevhenii Kucherenko. But Stephenson headed the visitors level, and the home side – unable to break them down after the break – were forced to settle for a second draw in three matches.View image in fullscreenDundee United’s Luca Stephenson (right) equalises against Hearts at TynecastlePhotograph: Jane Barlow/PATheHeartsmanager, Derek McInnes, said the draw felt like a defeat, although he conceded his team did not warrant anything more. “I thought we didn’t deserve any more than the point we got,” he said. “It’s difficult to be too critical of the fact that we’re 12 games in, we’ve hit 30 points already, we’re in the second week of November and we’re still unbeaten.“But there’s no doubting that we came here with high expectations to get three points and I’ve got to accept that we weren’t good enough to get the three points today.”Quick GuideSaturday roundup: VAR pain for St Mirren in Hibs defeatShowSt Mirrenmanager Stephen Robinson expressed doubts over the accuracy of VAR after seeing two more goals disallowed for offside in their 3-0 defeat byHibernian.Saints had seen two goals disallowed for  offside in their three previous Scottish Premiership matches, as well as losing two players to red cards after VAR reviews. On Saturday, marginal calls denied Marcus Fraser an early headed opener and prevented Dan Nlundulu claiming an equaliser early in the second half.Robinson said: 'We equalise, we go in front, it changes the game completely, so whether they're onside or not, you hope VAR's got it right. Which would be a surprise to be fair.'

LeadingLeicesterwith four minutes to play, news filtered through that Liverpool had conceded a 93rd-minute equaliser to share the points with Brighton in a 1-1 draw. It meant that three points would lift the Hammers off the bottom of the Women’s Super League for the first time this season.Rehanne Skinner’s and Gareth Taylor’s teams have been in lockstep and they somehow contrived to mirror each other once again. As their relegation rivals had done minutes earlier, the Hammers’ conceded in the 97th minute to burst their supporters’ bubble and drop two points in a 1-1 draw, ensuring the parity between the two continued.The two sides have been rooted to the bottom for the first seven weeks of the season, both losing all seven games, unable to find rewards despite improving performances, and their managers will be at a loss to as how their first wins of the season eluded them once again.‘We need justice’: Slegers calls for VAR in WSL after Arsenal denied by officialsRead moreWest Ham’s campaign to date has been epitomised by an inability to take their chances and lapses of concentration. Both characteristics reared their heads again on this occasion against a Leicester side that offered little going forward but managed to remain in the game until the final moments.The Hammers’ frontline has the potential to be very dangerous with the pace of Viviane Asseyi and Ffion Morgan, the instinct of Shekiera Martinez and the industry of Riko Ueki. They have, however, been plagued by a lack of clinical finishing. Chances presented themselves to all four of them throughout but it was only a scrappy finish from Martinez that put their noses in front.Danger always remains when the scoreline is that narrow and the Foxes made the hosts pay with almost the final kick of the match when the substitute Shannon O’Brien snuck in at the far post to turn in Sari Kees’s low ball.Liverpool, meanwhile, earned their first point of the season against eighth-placedBrighton.Both sides have significant injury problems, particularly in attack.The Sweden striker Beata Olsson was handed another start by Taylor after she had impressed last week, scoring her first WSL goal. For the Seagulls, meanwhile, Dario Vidosic again opted for the 20-year-old Carla Camacho to lead the line in place ofMichelle Agyemang, who is out for the season.It was arguably the best performance of Taylor’s tenure as Liverpool took the game to Brighton, getting in behind the defence consistently. Olsson’s first-half opener set them on their way. They proceeded to hit the woodwork twice – first Fuka Nagano and then Sam Kerr – while Faye Kirby had to be alert with a series of smart stops at the other end with the crossbar getting involved once again.Liverpool’s hearts were broken, however, when Rosa Kafaji broke free in the box to strike deep into injury time.View image in fullscreenRosa Kafaji scored the equaliser for Brighton in injury time to dash Liverpool’s hopes.Photograph: Steve Taylor/PPAUK/ShutterstockManchester Citywent top of the table, leapfrogging Chelsea for the first time this season thanks to a hard-working 2-1 victory overEverton.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These were the 20-year-old’s first goals since joining Jocelyn Prêcheur’s side permanently from Arsenal.Spurs came from behind twice – Cathinka Tandberg cancelled out Godfrey’s opener before Eveliina Summanen’s sublime free-kick brought them level after Nikita Parris had put the hosts back in front.There was a lengthy stoppage for an injury to Tottenham’s goalkeeper Lize Kop before the hosts opened up a two-goal advantage, first through an unfortunate Amanda Nildén own goal and then Godfrey’s second to seal the three points.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueLondon City LionessesTottenham Hotspur WomenLiverpool FC WomenBrighton & Hove Albion WomenWest Ham United WomenLeicester City WomennewsShareReuse this content"

But it is clear there is still a lot of work to do to get this once formidable Wales side back to its glory days.It would be dereliction of Borthwick’s duty not to harness Arundell’s raw talent | Gerard MeagherRead moreAlongside their torrid form, discussions will be focused on the Wales centre Ben Thomas after he escaped a red card. Thomas was being held in a ruck and kicked a leg towards Pablo Matera’s head, for which he was shown a yellow card.The incident was referred to bunker review but remained at the sin‑bin threshold, the fact he did not make contact with Matera’s head a large part of the reason why. However, the decision was heavily discussed with the former referee Nigel Owens putting the case forward on S4C that Thomas should not have even had a yellow card, while many fans believed the punishment should have involved him being shown a straight red.Tandy said of the incident: “There is not a real angle that I have seen that is conclusive to what it is. I think there is lots going on. If it is lashing out, you can’t do that. But also when I am looking at it in a broader sense, there is a lot of holding on the floor so if you are trying to free yourself [that can happen]. We will probably get a proper angle so I can assess it better.”The result was not the only bad news for Wales as their stalwart captain, Jac Morgan, who was the team’s brightest spark, dislocated his shoulder in the process of scoring a try. Tandy confirmed the back‑row was “not looking good for the rest of the autumn” and that they would be calling someone else up.There were some positive aspects to Wales’s game, predominantly through Morgan and the full-back Blair Murray, but another encouraging detail for Wales was the return of Louis Rees-Zammit. The wing left rugby in early 2024 to pursue his NFL dream but came back to rugby in August, signing for Bristol Bears. He has been struggling with injury which meant his return at the Principality Stadium was one as a replacement off the bench. The 24-year-old, whose last Test appearance came against Argentina in the 2023 Rugby World Cup quarter-final, came on in the 45th minute and he brought some much-needed voracity in attack.View image in fullscreenJac Morgan dislocates his shoulder in the process of scoring a try for Wales, with Steve Tandy saying he was: ‘not looking good for the rest of the autumn’.Photograph: Chris Fairweather/Huw Evans/ShutterstockFor Argentina, the winger Mateo Carreras was a star all afternoon and was at the heart of everything good the visitors produced.Chatter on trains pre-game underlined the pressure this Wales team are under. Two groups of fans met on a packed carriage and started talking about recent results.“It’s embarrassing isn’t it,” one said, while the other replied: “I know, you don’t like to say you’re Welsh sometimes.” Thousands of empty seats at the Principality Stadium was further evidence of how many Welsh fans currently feel about their team.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Argentina were out of the blocks quickly with two sensational tries but Wales levelled the scores through Tomos Williams and the hooker Dewi Lake, which had supporters in a full chorus of “Wales, Wales, Wales”. However, those chants were soon muted when Argentina regained their lead after Thomas’s yellow card.Quick GuideMatch detailsShowWalesMurray; Rogers (Rees-Zammit 44), Llewellyn, B Thomas, Adams; Edwards (J Evans 65), T Williams (Hardy 76); Carre (Smith 44), Lake (Belcher 55), Assiratti (Griffin 44), D Jenkins, Beard, Mann, Morgan (Cracknell 55), Wainwright (F Thomas 65).TriesWilliams, Lake, Morgan, Murray.ConsEdwards (3), J EvansArgentinaS Carreras; Delguy, Piccardo, Chocobares (Mallia 59), M Carreras (Isgro 61); Prisciantelli, Benítez Cruz (Moyano 65); Vivas (Gallo 45), Montoya (Ruíz 67)), Delgado (Rapetti 45), Petti, Kremer (Alemanno 61), Matera, JM González, Oviedo (Grondona 59).TriesDelgado, M Carreras, Cruz, Delguy, Prisciantelli (2), Grondona.ConsS Carreras (7).Pen: S CarrerasRefereeBen O'Keeffe (NZ)Attendance50,185Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The hosts needed to be the next to score but a stop-start run finished off a try for the wing Bautista Delguy, which strengthened Argentina’s grip on the game. A sin‑bin for Williams for an off-the-ball tackle saw Wales reduced again but Morgan scored next. However, it was the visitors who polished off the game with two more tries.There are some caveats to this result. It was Tandy’s first game in charge and it will take time to change Wales’s fortunes. It was also the hosts’ first game since July, while Argentina have some miles in their legs after competing in the Rugby Championship. But only time will tell how long such caveats excuse results and Tandy faces his next test on Saturday when his team face Japan.Explore more on these topicsRugby unionWales rugby union teamArgentina rugby union teamnewsShareReuse this content"

Musovski scored unassisted from the center of the box three minutes later for a two-goal lead.Minnesota United cut it to 2-1 in the 19th minute when Pereyra scored off a set piece after a yellow card on Seattle’s Yéimar Gómez Andrade.

Cincinnati went undefeated against Inter Miami this season, winning 3-0 at home on 16 July and playing to a scoreless draw at Fort Lauderdale on 26 July. Messi was in the lineup for the first meeting, but not the second.“We know Cincinnati will be a tough test,” Inter Miami’s Jordi Alba –who is retiringwhen this playoff run ends – said after his 100th appearance with the club.Messi is the heavy favorite to win his second straight MLS MVP award, and if that happens he would be the first back-to-back winner in league history. He also won the Golden Boot as MLS’ leading scorer this season,just finalized a new three-year dealto remain with the club through 2028 and seems to be playing his best soccer at the perfect time for Inter Miami.This is the first time Inter Miami have gotten this far in theMLSplayoffs. A year ago, in Messi’s first full season with the club, they lost a Game 3 of Round 1 at home as the Supporters Shield winners and were ousted by Atlanta.Not this time.

        "Content": "The featured essayUS healthcareWhat we lose when we surrender care to algorithmsA dangerous faith in AI is sweeping American healthcare – with consequences for the basis of society itselfEric ReinhartSun 9 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTShareView image in fullscreenThe computer interrupted while Pamela was still speaking. I had accompanied her – my dear friend – to a recent doctor’s appointment. She is in her 70s, lives alone while navigating multiple chronic health issues, and has been getting short of breath climbing the front stairs to her apartment. In the exam room, she spoke slowly and self-consciously, the way people often do when they are trying to describe their bodies and anxieties to strangers. Midway through her description of how she had been feeling, the doctor clicked his mouse and a block of text began to bloom across the computer monitor.The clinic had adopted an artificial-intelligence scribe, and it was transcribing and summarizing the conversation in real time. It was also highlighting keywords, suggesting diagnostic possibilities and providing billing codes. The doctor, apparently satisfied that his computer had captured an adequate description of Pamela’s chief complaint and symptoms, turned away from us and began reviewing the text on the screen as Pamela kept speaking.When the appointment was over, as a physician myself and anthropologist interested in the evolving culture of medicine, I asked if I could glance at the AI-generated note. The summary was surprisingly fluid and accurate. But it did not capture the catch in Pamela’s voice when she mentioned the stairs, the flicker of fear when she implied that she now avoided them and avoided going out, the unspoken connection to Pamela’s traumatic relation to her own mother’s death that the doctor never elicited.Soon, not using AI to help determine diagnoses or treatments could be seen as malpracticeCraig SpencerScenes like this are becoming increasingly common. Physicians, for generations, have resisted new technologies that threatened their authority or unsettled established practice. But artificial intelligence is breaking that tradition by sweeping into clinical practice faster than almost any tool before it. Two-thirds ofAmerican physicians– a 78% jump from the year prior – and 86% ofhealth systemsused artificial intelligence as part of their practice in 2024. “AI will be as common in healthcare as the stethoscope,”predictsDr Robert Pearl, the former CEO of Permanente Medical Group, one of the largest physician groups in the country. As my colleague Craig Spencerhas observed: “Soon, not using AI to help determine diagnoses or treatments could be seen as malpractice.”Policymakers and aligned business interests promise AI willsolve physician burnout,lower healthcare costsandexpand access. Entrepreneurstout itas the great equalizer, bringing high-quality care to people excluded from existing systems. Hospital and physician leaders such as Dr Eric Topol have hailed AI asthe means by which humanity will finally be restoredto clinical practice; according to thiswidely embraced argument, it will liberate doctors fromdocumentation drudgeryand allow them to finally turn away from their computer screens and look patients in the eye. Meanwhile, patients are already making use of AI chatbots as supplements to – or substitutes for – doctors in what many see as a democratization of medical knowledge.The problem is that when it is installed in a health sector that prizes efficiency, surveillance and profit extraction, AI becomes not a tool for care and community but simply another instrument for commodifying human life.It is true that large language models can churn through mountains of medical literature, generate tidy summaries, and even outperform human physicians on diagnostic reasoning tasks in some studies. Last month, a new artificial intelligence system from OpenEvidence became the first AI toscore 100%on the United States Medical Licensing Exam. Research suggests AI can read radiologic images with accuracy rivaling human specialists, detect skin cancers from smartphone photos, and flag early signs of sepsis in hospitalized patients faster than clinical teams. During the Covid-19 pandemic, AI models were deployed to predict surges and allocate scarce resources, fueling hopes that similar systems could optimize everything from ICU beds to medication supply chains.What makes AI so compelling is not simply faith in technology but the way it suggests we can improve medicine by leapfrogging the difficult work of structural change to confront disease-causing inequality, corporate interests and oligarchic power.The rise of end times fascism | Naomi Klein and Astra TaylorRead moreThe US is the most medicalized country on Earth. Incentivized by profit, it spends roughly twice as much per capita on healthcare as other high-income nations, while simultaneously excluding millions from it and suffering –across all income levels– from far higher rates of preventable disease, disability and death. At the same time,public health scholarshave longarguedthatmedicine alone cannot fixwhat ails us at a population level. Instead, much more attention and public investment must be directed towardsnon-medical social carethat is essential for preventing disease, lowering preventable healthcare needs and costs, and enabling medical interventions to be effective.For many, tackling the perversity of American healthcare feels out of reach as the US lurches ever further into authoritarianism. In this context, AI is offered as a balm not because it addresses root causes of abysmal US public health, but because it allows policymakers and corporations to gloss over them.This faith in AI also reflects a misunderstanding of care itself, a misunderstanding decades in the making in the service of an idea now treated as an unquestionable good: evidence-based medicine (EBM).Emerging in the 1990swith the unassailable goal of improving care, EBM challenged practices based on habit and tradition by insisting decisions be grounded in rigorous research, ideally randomized controlled trials. First championed at McMaster University by physicians David Sackett and Gordon Guyatt, EBM quickly hardened into orthodoxy, embedded in curricula, accreditation standards and performance metrics that reshaped clinical judgment into compliance with statistical averages and confidence intervals. The gains were real: effective therapies spread faster, outdated ones were abandoned, and an ethic of scientific accountability took hold.But as the model transformed medicine, it narrowed the scope of clinical encounters. The messy, relational and interpretive dimensions of care – the ways physicians listen, intuit and elicit what patients may not initially say – were increasingly seen as secondary to standardized protocols. Doctors came to treat not singular people but data points. Under pressure for efficiency, EBM ossified into an ideology: “best practices” became whatever could be measured, tabulated and reimbursed. The complexity of patients’ lives was crowded out by metrics, checkboxes and algorithms. What began as a corrective to medicine’s biases paved the way for a new myopia: the conviction that medicine can and should bereduced to numbers.View image in fullscreenThe loss of the unsaidThe uses of AI do not just affect how we listen but also how we think and speak about ourselves, particularly as patients. Not long ago, a young woman came to see me, in my capacity as a psychiatrist, for chronic fatigue and associated experiences of sadness, anxiety and loss. She had experienced many rounds of dismissal by other doctors to whom she had appealed for help. Along the way, she developed strategies to try to avoid the experiences of humiliation she associated with doctors’ offices. One of those strategies: using ChatGPT to refine her narrative of herself. In the week leading up to her appointment with me, she had already told her story at least 10 times to the ChatGPT app she had installed on her phone. She had described her headaches, her racing heart in the early morning, the exhaustion that did not ease with rest. Each time, the bot responded in calm, fluent medical language, naming diagnostic possibilities and suggesting next steps. She refined her answers with each attempt, learning which words elicited which responses, as if she were studying for an exam.When she spoke to me, she used the same phrasing ChatGPT had given back to her: precise, clinical, flattened language largely stripped of affect or reference to her personal history, relationships and desires. Her deep fears were now encased in borrowed phrases, translated into a format she thought I would recognize as legitimate medical concerns, take seriously and address.It is true that her efforts made bureaucratic documentation easy. But much else was lost in the process. Her own uncertainty, distrust of her own self-perception and body, and her life history and idiosyncratic way of making sense of her suffering had been sanded away, leaving a smooth, ready-made medical discourse ready for transcription and transmission to pharmacists and insurance companies. In the hands of a clinician practicing EBM predicated on symptom scales, a reflexive prescription for antidepressants or stimulants – or a battery of tests for endocrine or autoimmune diseases – might have seemed the natural response.But those interventions, while perhaps later appropriate, would have skated over the deeper social and personal roots of her exhaustion. My patient’s AI-distorted narrative of herself thus not only obscured her experience but it also risked directing her care down a path of algorithmic pseudo-fixes that carry considerable risk of unintended harm.AI views both suffering and care as computational problemsThis encounter has been replicated in various forms with several other patients I have met over the last year as AI tools have rapidly infiltrated everyday life. One man in his late 60s, retired after a lucrative business career, divorced, estranged from his two adult sons and enmeshed in an abusive relationship came to me struggling with profound loneliness, regret and severe alcohol dependence, punctuated by panic attacks so severe he feared he might die alone of a heart attack in his downtown high-rise condo. Before seeing me, he had spent weeks using ChatGPT as a therapist to great effect, he told me. He spent hours every day writing to it about his symptoms and past, and taking comfort in its consistently complimentary replies that assured him he had been wronged by others in his life.ChatGPT had become not only his counselor but his main source of companionship. By the time we met, he fluently named his attachment style and the personality disorders ChatGPT had assigned to his family members, and repeated treatment suggestions – none of which addressed his daily consumption of a fifth of vodka. When I asked how he was feeling, he hesitated, then looked down at his phone in his hand as if to check whether his words matched what the psychological profile ChatGPT had laid out for him. The machine had substituted for both his voice and the human connection he craved.We risk entering a perverse loop: machines are supplying the language with which patients relay their suffering, and doctors are using machines to record and respond to that suffering. This cultivates what psychologists call “cognitive miserliness”, or a tendency to default to the most readily available answer rather than engage in critical inquiry or self-reflection. By outsourcing thought, and ultimately the most intimate definitions of ourselves to AI, doctors and patients risk becoming yet further alienated from one another.In this trajectory we can see the evolution of what Michel Foucault described in The Birth of the Clinic as the “medical gaze” – the separation and isolation of the diseased body from the lived experience of the person and their social environment. Where the 19th-century gaze fragmented the patient into lesions and signs visible to the clinician, and the late 20th-century evidence-based gaze translated patients into odds ratios and treatment protocols, the 21st-century algorithmic gaze dissolves both patient and doctor alike into never-ending streams of automated data. AI views both suffering and care as computational problems.The arguments in support of this transformation of the clinic are familiar. Human physicians misdiagnose, while algorithms can catch subtle patterns invisible to the eye. Humans forget the latest science; algorithms can absorb every new article the instant it is published. Physicians burn out, but algorithms never tire. Such claims are true in a narrow sense. But the leap from these advantages to a wholesale embrace of AI as medicine’s future depends on dangerously simplistic assumptions.The first is that AI is more objective than human physicians. In reality, AI is no less biased; it is merely biased differently, and in ways harder to detect. Models rely on existing datasets, which reflectdecades of systemic inequities: fromracial biasesbaked into kidney and lung-function tests to the underrepresentation of women and minorities in clinical trials. Pulse oximeters, for example,systematically underestimate hypoxemiain people with darker skin tones; during the Covid pandemic, these errorsfed into triage algorithms, delaying care for Black patients.Race-based correctionsfor kidney function long influenced transplant eligibility across the country. Once such biases are embedded in protocols, they persist for years.These problems are compounded by the assumption that more data automatically translates to better care. But no amount of data will repair underfunded clinics, reverse physician shortages or protect patients from predatory insurers.‘Headed for technofascism’: the rightwing roots of Silicon ValleyRead moreAI threatens to deepen these problems, obscuring discriminatory and profit-driven policies behind a sheen of computational neutrality. Emerging AI tools are ultimately controlled by the billionaires and corporations who own them, set their incentives, and determine their uses. And as has become increasingly apparent in Trump’s second term, many of these AI scions – Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and others – are open eugenicists guided by prejudice against gender and racial minorities and disabled people. What is emerging is a form of technofascism, as this administration helps a small cadre of allied tech magnates consolidate control over the nation’s data – and with it, the power to surveil and discipline entire populations.AI tools are perfectly suited to their project ofauthoritarian surveillance, which theTrump administrationis actively advancing through its “AI action plan”. By stripping away regulatory guardrails and granting tech firms free rein so long as they align with the administration’s ideology, the plan hands unprecedented power to corporations already steeped in eugenicist thinking. Beneath the rhetoric of innovation lies a simple, sobering fact: AI can only function by vacuuming up enormous troves of human data – data about our bodies, pain, behaviors, moods, anxieties, phobias, diets, substance use, sleep patterns, relationships, work routines, sexual practices, traumatic experiences, childhood memories, disabilities and life expectancy. This means that each step toward AI-driven medicine is also a step toward deeper, more opaque forms of data capture, surveillance and social control.Already, health insurance companies have usedAI-driven “predictive analytics”to flag patients as too costly, quietly downgrading their care or denying coverage outright. UnitedHealthrejected rehabilitation claimsfor elderly patients deemed unlikely to recover quickly enough, while Cigna used automated review systemsto deny thousands of claimsin seconds, with no physician ever even reading them.The result of all this efficiency is not more presence in caregiving, but lessAnother key assumption behind AI optimism is that it will free physicians to devote more time and attention to patients. Over the last several decades, countless technological advances in medicine – from electronic health records to billing automation – have been sold as a way to lighten the clinician’s load. Indeed,controlled trialsin which AI scribes wrote patient notes for doctors resulted in time savings and improved satisfaction with their workdays – but only in controlled experiments in which time savings are not accompanied by increased productivity expectations.The real world of the US healthcare system doesn’t generally work that way. Each technological advancement that could free up physician time has instead tightened the productivity ratchet: these “efficiency gains” have simply been used to squeeze more visits, more billing, and more profit out of every hour. In other words, whatever time and energy technology saves, the system immediately recaptures them to maximize profit. With private equity gobbling up healthcare facilities at an alarming rate, there is little reason to think the medical industry’s uses of AI will be different.The result of all this efficiency is not more presence in caregiving, but less. Already, patients’ most common complaint is that their doctors do not listen to them. They describe being treated as bundles of symptoms and lab values rather than as whole people. Good clinicians know what matters most in interactions with patients are the hesitations, silences and nervous laughs – the things left unsaid. These cannot be reduced to data points. They require presence, patience and attunement to the affective states, social relationships, family dynamics and fears of each patient. This is obviously true in the case of mental healthcare, but it is no less true in internal medicine, oncology or surgery, where patients are appealing for care in what are often the most vulnerable moments of their lives – moments in which a physician responds not just as a technician but as a person.AI, by contrast, is built to erase silence and isolate the patient as a calculable organism. It cannot recognize that a patient’s first version of their story is often not their real one – not the one that is troubling them most. Moreover,studiesof doctors’ reliance on AI underline that it frequently causes rapidclinical deskilling: when algorithms propose diagnoses or management plans, physicians’ reasoning skills atrophy, leaving them more dependent on machines and less capable of independent judgment. Rather than correcting human fallibility, AI seems more likely to amplify it by training clinicians out of their capacity to listen and think critically, collaboratively and creatively.View image in fullscreenReclaiming careIf the danger of AI medicine is forgetting what genuine care entails, then we must collectively recall the foundation of caregiving that has been obscured under US health capitalism. Care is not about diagnoses or prescriptions. It relies on something more fundamental: the provision of support to the other alongside the cultivation of an inner experience of concern toward others.This kind of care is inseparable from politics and the possibility of community. As philosophers from Socrates to Søren Kierkegaard and feminist theorists like Carol Gilligan and Joan Tronto have long argued, care is not only a clinical task butan ethical and political practice. It is, in the deepest sense, a practice of disalienation – of recovering our sense of ourselves as singular beings in community with one another in which individual difference is valued rather than erased.That is why care has transformative power beyond health. To be truly listened to – to be recognized not as a case but as a person – can change not just how one experiences illness, but how one experiences oneself and the world. It can foster the capacity to care for others across differences, to resist hatred and violence, to build the fragile social ties upon which democracy depends.By contrast, when medicine is reduced to data and transactions, it not only fails patients and demoralizes doctors. It also degrades democracy itself. A system that alienates people in their moments of deepest vulnerability – bankrupting them, gaslighting them, leaving them unheard – breeds despair and rage. It creates the conditions in which authoritarians gain traction.True care is not a transaction to be optimized; it is a practice and a relationship to be protectedIn this light, the rush to automate care is not politically neutral. To hollow out medicine’s capacity for presence and recognition is to hollow out one of the last civic institutions through which people might feel themselves to matter to another human being – to suffocate the very basis of society itself.Perhaps the most dangerous assumption behind the rise of AI in medicine is that its current trajectory and private ownership structure is inevitable. When we refuse this narrative of inevitability, we can finally recognize thatthe real alternative to our present is political, not technological.It requires investing in the caregiving workforce, strengthening publicly owned systems for both medical and social care, expanding the welfare state to combat growing inequality, and creating conditions for clinicians to care for patients as people, not data.Maga’s era of ‘soft eugenics’: let the weak get sick, help the clever breedRead moreTechnology, including AI, need not be inherently dehumanizing or alienating. In a national health system oriented toward genuine care, AI in medicine could help track medication safety, identify the most vulnerable individuals for intensive social and financial support, prioritize remedying inequities, or support overburdened clinicians and support staff without monetizing their every move. But such uses depend on a political economy premised on care, not extraction and the endless commodification of human life – one that values human diversity, collective flourishing and supporting each individual’s unique life potential over data capture, standardization and profit.If AI in service of corporate imperatives becomes medicine’s guiding force, these dimensions will not merely be neglected. They will be actively erased, recoded as inefficiencies, written out of what counts as care.To resist AI optimism is often cast as anti-progress or naive luddism. But progress worth pursuing requires refusing the illusion that faster, cheaper and more standardized is the same as better. True care is not a transaction to be optimized; it is a practice and a relationship to be protected – the fragile work of listening, presence and trust. If we surrender care to algorithms, we will lose not only the art of medicine but also the human connection and solidarity we need to reclaim our lives from those who would reduce them to data and profit.Eric Reinhartis a political anthropologist, psychiatrist and psychoanalystSpot illustrations by Georgette Smith"

Surely, that is the definition of spoiling your own fun? “Like going into a corn maze and just wanting a straight line to the end,” says one TikToker quoted in the article. There’s also an interview with a keen reader who uses ChatGPT as a book club replacement, scraping the internet and aggregating “stimulating opinions and perspectives”. All well and good (actually, no, it sounds bleak as hell) until he had a character’s death spoilered in the fantasy epic he had been enjoying.Meanwhile, Substack seems to be clogging up with AI-generated essays. The nu-blogging platform is an earnestly artisanal space where writers craft their stuff; subcontracting that to a bot seems like the acme of pointlessness. Will Storr, who writes about storytelling, examines this boggling trend and the tells that give it away onhis own Substack, including a penchant for what he calls “the impersonal universal”: sweeping statements that sound deep but aren’t. There is, he says, “A white-noise generality to its insights, an uncanny vagueness that makes the mind glaze over.”I’m baffled how anyone could enjoy using a large language model (LLM) to sound blandly “clever” or participate in any AI-hacked hobby. It doesn’t matter much, I suppose – this isn’t AI as existential threat. But it matters for fun – let the bots take our work, but not our joy! I wouldn’t presume to tell anyone how to enjoy themselves – I’mno expert on fun, and would definitely end up sounding like an AI-generated Substack if I did (hug a tree, speak to a stranger, laugh with loved ones). But I have been thinking what makesmefeel most vividly alive and I’m aiming to do more of it – my individual fightback against the “impersonal universal”.The first one is singing. I expect AI can scrape the musical canon to compose an ethereal robot madrigal, but it can’t conjure the eccentric entertainment of my small choir composed of very particular humans. We’re not the most polished singers, but listening to one another and trying to blend our voices gives me an intense sense of connection (research agrees: group singing mediatesspeedy social bonding). Occasionally, everything comes together and we produce a few seconds of surprising beauty, earning our choir director’s sparingly granted, quietly mimed chef’s kiss. When it doesn’t, it’s fun anyway.The next is stuff – not my own but other people’s. I find the idiosyncratic things people prize, acquire and discard endlessly stimulating. I usually get my fix at York’s weekly car boot sale – an overwhelming jumble of inexpertly stuffed badgers, Power Rangers merch, fishing tackle and ceramic mice dressed as Victorian washerwomen that makes my heart sing. It works with more exalted stuff, too, especially textiles in Renaissance paintings: clothes, rugs, curtains, tapestries. I recently spent a heady 10 minutes in a miraculously empty room in gathering darkness at New York’s Frick Collection withHolbein’s portrait of Thomas More, examining his fur collar and red velvet sleeves and imagining how they felt and why he chose them.I get a fair amount of unbridled joy from simply being an animal: walking, digging in the soil and watching other animals (OK, yes, I mean birds), but mostly – and I say this as a lifelong introvert – I get it from people. When I try to identify my most reliable source of pleasure, it’s wandering round a strange city looking at its inhabitants. What are people wearing, eating, talking about; what pisses them off; what kind of dogs do they have? From toddler tantrums to displays of affection to queue etiquette, it’s an all-you-can-eat human buffet. I just watchedI Am Martin Parr, a documentary on the photographer with a magpie eye for the essence of British life, and he gets it. Now in his 70s, Parr is as driven to observe and document people in all their beautifully strange specificity as ever; he is, he says, “still excited about going out and seeing this crazy world we live in.”That’s the secret for me: AI can obligingly aggregate and explain what we are en masse, but it blends all our colours to a muddy brown; it can’t capture the joy of the absolutely particular.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionComputingHobbiesSubstackcommentShareReuse this content"

It then automatically creates objection letters, AI-written speeches to deliver to the planning committees, and even AI-generated videos to “influence councillors”.Kent residents Hannah and Paul George designed the system after estimating they spent hundreds of hours attempting to navigate the planning process when they opposed plans to convert a building near their home into a mosque.For £45-a-time, they are offering the tool to people who, like them, could not afford a specialist lawyer to help navigate labyrinthine planning laws. They said it would help “everyone have a voice, to level the playing field and make the whole process fairer”.It is a modest enterprise but it is not alone. A similar service, Planningobjection.com, is promoting £99 AI-generated objection letters with the tagline “stop moaning and take action”.Community campaigners have alsoencouraged supporters to use ChatGPT to craft objection letterson Facebook, claiming it is like having “a planning solicitor at your fingertips”.One leading planning lawyer warned such AIs could “supercharge nimbyism” and if they became widely used could cause the planning system to “grind to a halt”, with planning officials potentially deluged with submissions.Sebastian Charles said his firm, Aardvark Planning Law, had seen AI-generated objections to planning applications that included references to previous cases and appeal decisions that, when checked by a human lawyer, did not exist.“The danger is decisions are made on the wrong basis,” he said. “Elected members making final decisions could easily believe AI-generated planning speeches made by members of the public, even if they are full of made up case law and regulations.”Hannah George, a co-founder of Objector, denied the platform was about automating nimbyism.“It’s just about making the planning system fair,” she said. “At the moment, from our experience, it’s not. And with the government on this ‘build, baby, build’ mission, we see that only going one way.”Objector has said while AI-created errors are a concern, it uses two different AI models and cross-checks the results in an effort to reduce the risk of “hallucinations” – a term used to describe when AIs make things up.The current Objector system is designed to tackle small planning applications, for example, repurposing a local office building or a neighbour’s home extension. A capability to challenge much larger applications, such as a housing estate on greenbelt land, is in development, said George.The Labour government has been promoting AI as one solution to clearing planning backlogs. It recently launched a tool calledExtract, which aims to speed up planning processes and help the government carry out its mission to build 1.5m new homes.But there may be an AI “arms race” developing, said John Myers, the director of the Yimby Alliance, a campaign calling for more homes to be built with the support of local communities.“This will turbocharge objections to planning applications and will lead to people finding obscure reasons [for opposing developments] that they have not found before,” he said.A new dynamic could emerge “where one side tries to deploy AI to accelerate the process, and the other side deploys AI to stop it,” he said. “I don’t see an end to that until we find a way to bring forward developments people want.”The government may already have an AI system that could respond to a rise in AI-generated objections. It has launched an AI tool calledConsult, which analyses responses to public consultations.It did so in the expectation that “widespread adoption of large language models [such as that used by Objector] will likely only increase the number of responses that consultations attract”.Paul Smith, the managing director of Strategic Land Group, a consultancy, this month reported on the rising use of AI by people to oppose planning applications.“AI objections undermine the whole rationale for public consultation,” he wrote in Building magazine. “Local communities, we are told, know their areas best … So, we should ask them what they think.“But if all local residents are doing is deciding they don’t like the scheme before uploading the application documents to a computer to find out why they don’t like it, is there really any point in asking them at all?”Explore more on these topicsPlanning policyLocal governmentArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingHousingSocial housingPropertynewsShareReuse this content"

Davie stressed that the decision was his alone – neither the board, nor even many of those who led the coordinated attack among rightwing press and politicians expected it.Now the resignations of both Davie and the CEO ofBBCNews, Deborah Turness, have shown that baying for blood gets results.The biggest shock is that this saga began just a week ago with the leak of a 19-page “devastating memo” from Michael Prescott, a former political journalist who spent three years as anexternal adviserto the broadcaster, published in the Telegraph. The dossier alleges BBC Panorama doctored a speech by Trump, making him appear to support the January 6 rioters, that its Arabic coverage privileged pro-Hamas views, and that a group of LGBTQ employees had excessive influence on coverage of sex and gender. The Telegraph wrote that the BBC’s very silence “proves there is a serious problem”. Meanwhile, the former UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s “blast” at Nick Robinson, the only BBC staffer to publicly fight back against the accusations, leads the Mail on Sunday, and Donald Trump’s press secretary has called the BBC “100% fake news”Leave to one side for now the direct allegations about specific failures of BBC coverage, and the BBC’s own baffling inability or unwillingness to defend itself over the past week. But the row obscures the context that explains what is, at the heart of the matter, a political campaign against the BBC that could act as a textbook example of how to confuse and undermine the kind of journalism that is, at the very least, aiming for impartiality in a sea of spin and distortion.Prescott stresses he has never been a member of a political party and that his views “do not come with any political agenda” in the introduction to his 8,000-word note. Yet each criticism of BBC coverage comes from the anti-progressive culture-war playbook.For example, he is “shocked” that after an hour-long Panorama documentary dealing with Trump and the January 6 insurgency, there was no “similar, balancing” programme about the Democrat presidential candidate, Kamala Harris. As someone who has spent years dealing with the issue of impartiality told me, this is an entirely wrongheaded and now discredited view of impartiality, the sort of view that led to airtime beinggiven to climate denial.Prescott also accuses the BBC of amplifying “issues of racism”. Yet his own argument and suggested source material undermines his own claims of neutrality. He cites a 2022 report byHistory Reclaimed, also published in the Telegraph, which highlights four BBC programmes with “an overly simplistic and distorted narrative about British colonial racism, slave-trading and its legacy”. While some of its members are senior Oxbridge academics, History Reclaimed’s website makes clear that the group was formed to counter “culture war” narratives in the media that suggest British history is shameful.Prescott remains “mystified” that his requests for BBC producers and editors to meet the report’s authors were ignored. Yet in its own review at the time, the BBC concluded that History Reclaimed “cherrypicking a handful of examples or highlighting genuine mistakes in thousands of hours of output on TV and radio does not constitute analysis and is not a true representation of BBC content”.Sadly, there has been no corresponding BBC response to the rehashed criticism in Prescott’s own extensive review of past complaints.None of this is to say that the BBC has not made mistakes. At the very least, the Panorama documentary appears to have included a bad and misleading edit of an hour-long Trump speech, which is unacceptable even if that speech was subsequently found to have encouraged insurrection. The BBC is expected to apologise on Monday over the Trump edit. That should have been enough.Prescott’s 10 years as chief political correspondent and then political editor of the Sunday Times must have also helped his laser focus on two issues in particular that have divided even the BBC’s biggest supporters. Its reporting in Gaza, specifically that of theBBC Arabic service– given greater prominence recently not just because of the war but because of cuts in BBC News – has wounded many in the Jewish community, while the BBC’s handling of trans rights has divided even its own staff.Yet pity the BBC that, while tiptoeing not always gracefully through these editorial minefields with thousands of hours of content, it has also to deal with enemies from within.Concerns about an apparentconflict of interestwere raised when Johnson appointed Prescott toadvise Ofcomover its new chair four years ago. Prescott, whose PR firm Hanover was involved in advising media companies such as Sky, has also been described as a friend of Robbie Gibb, a former Conservative government head of communications who joined the BBC board after helping to launch the rightwing news channel GB News. However, Prescott was allowed to continue in that role, and a government spokesperson said on Prescott’s behalfthat the appointmentwas “fair and open and there are no conflicts of interest”. He was later appointed external adviser to the BBC standards board.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

BBC sources tell me that the chair, Samir Shah, immediately ordered Peter Johnston, the director of editorial complaints and reviews, to work on a response and a briefing was discussed at the board on 16 October.So why has the BBC so far said nothing, apart from letting it be known that Shah is likely to apologise for the Trump edit when called to respond to the culture, media and sport committee tomorrow?Given the sheer volume of the content it airs and criticism it receives, the BBC can sometimes be forgiven for not wanting to stir passions further. But by spending days insisting that it did not comment on “leaked documents”, the corporation has simply looked weak and cowardly, just when it needs to be robust and brave. October Films, the independent production company that made the Trump Panorama, is said to be working on a film about Nigel Farage.With many of the criticisms already looked at and addressed internally, should it really take so long to come out with a response? These are difficult times for the BBC. About to enter into negotiations to renew its charter after more than a decade of licence-fee cuts, it is also caught in political and economic headwinds. Johnson’s threat tocancel his licence feecomes after300,000 more householdsdid so over the past year.Trump’s threat of a lawsuit against the BBC follows his successful cowing of the US media, with a succession of commercial broadcasters agreeing to pay damages on the flimsiest of charges.

But to do that, it needs the trust of everyone who pays for its services.In his resignation letter, Davie pleads for a better future after 20 years at an organisation he loves. “We should champion [the BBC],” he writes. “Not weaponise it.” It feels as if this plea is already too late.Jane Martinson is professor of financial journalism at City St George’s and a member of the board of the Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian Media Group.

Officials and utilities can prevent thisSun 9 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTShareAs the stalemate over government funding and healthcare benefits continues, winter is approaching – but federal heating assistance, blocked by the shutdown, isn’t arriving in time. Millions of American families are about to face an impossible choice: heating their homes or putting food on the table. As the senator for a state known for its volatile winters and as executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, we call on states and utilities to choose a different outcome for those families and shut off the shutoffs. A nationwide freeze on utilities’ ability to disconnect customers from heat for nonpayment isn’t about politics – it’s about public safety.The breakdown in federal budget negotiations has frozen the release of funding for many of the essential services families rely on nationwide, including the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (Liheap). Liheap helps struggling households keep their heat and lights on by helping eligible families pay their utility bills. With those dollars locked up in Washington gridlock, America’s seniors and working families are now at risk of losing power – just as temperatures start to plummet.That’s why we’re calling on electric and gas utilities across the country to immediately suspend shutoffs for nonpayment until Liheap funds are released. This isn’t unprecedented: during the early months of the Covid pandemic, wecalled onutilities to stop shutoff for nonpayment due to the nature of the crisis, and many states and utilities didvoluntarily pause disconnectionsto protect public health. Many states already have a regular practice of pausing disconnections during cold winter months – including Massachusetts, which is leading the way by starting the shutoff moratorium earlier to protect people hurt by the shutdown.Under normal circumstances, states would already have received Liheap funding. However, because of the shutdown, most states are operating using limited carryover funds from last year’s budget or support from state emergency dollars. Depending on how long the government is closed, full funding may not arrive until well after most states would normally begin to help households pay heating bills.That delay matters. States spend roughly 80% of Liheap funds during the winter months, when heating costs are highest. Without early funding, millions of low-income households could fall behind on their bills and face their power getting turned off by their utility. And for the 9% ofhouseholds nationwide who rely on delivered fuelslike heating oil or propane which aren’t regulated by public service commissions, a funding delay could mean no heat at all.Families are getting squeezed on every side by the shutdown. The Trump administration has alreadyfired most of the staffresponsible for administering the program, and evenrecommended eliminatingLiheap entirely in its budget proposal.At the same time, energy prices are rising at the fastest pace in more than a decade. Electricity costs are up10% nationwidesince January, and heating bills are expected to rise nearly 8% this winter.More than 210 electric and natural gas utilitieshave either already increased rates or proposed rate increases within the next two years. Those increased costs are hitting consumers hard: household energy debt has ballooned to $23bn, up 31% in just 18 months, and one out of every six American households is behind on energy bills. And we’re expecting to see 500,000 more households get shut off this winter compared to last year.Energy insecurity has become one of America’s most overlooked emergencies. For low-income families, a missed payment isn’t just a financial inconvenience – it’s a crisis. When the power goes out, so do essential medical devices, space heaters, and refrigerators storing insulin and other medicines. In the richest country on earth, no family should have to face a freezing night or an avoidable emergency.Beyond the shutdown, we need longer-term solutions, likethe Heating and Cooling Relief Act, to increase funding and improve outreach for Liheap, so that no household is left behind. Until that happens, utilities have a duty to protect their customers. They should pause shutoffs immediately – or be told to do so by state utility commissioners – and work with state agencies to identify families most at risk. And we’ll be pushing, in Congress and outside, to make that happen.Because in America, no one should lose heat because Washington can’t keep its own lights on.Edward J Markey representsMassachusettsin the United States Senate and is a long-time advocate for affordable energy, consumer protection, and climate action.

A pope speaking up again and again for immigrants. Furious judges dressing down the Trump administration and ruling against it time after time after time, in response to the blizzard of lawsuits filed by human rights and environmental groups, states, cities and individuals. A senator speaking nonstop for 25 hours and another flying to El Salvador to find out what happened to his kidnapped constituent. The biggest day of protest in US history as an estimated 7 million people showed up for No Kings on 18 October in small towns and red counties as well as big blue cities.Weekly protests at Tesla salesrooms earlier this year that succeeded in damaging the brand, depressing global sales and prompting Tesla CEOElon Muskto retreat from his Doge slash-and-burn project. Federal workers resisting sometimes merely by adhering to law, truth and fact, and sometimes by speaking out as whistleblowers or in protests, as with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staff whostageda walkout in late August in solidarity with senior staff who’d just resigned in protest against the health and human services secretaryRobert F Kennedy Jr’s anti-vaccine policies.Extraordinary solidarity organizing for and with immigrants, refugees and the people targeted for looking like them on the streets, in the neighborhoods of Chicago, at Home Depot parking lots, around schools, in courtrooms. Democratic state attorneys general suing again and again, independently and together, and Illinois and California’s governors spending a lot of time ripping into Trump. Airports refusing to play the homeland security secretaryKristi Noem’s partisan-propaganda video about the congressional shutdown. Seven major universitiesrefusingto sign a contract with the administration promising financial incentives for compromising academic freedom. This is some of the resistance to the Trump administration and its policies we’ve seen since 20 January, and it’s worth surveying on the anniversary of the election.When people tell me that there’s been no resistance to the Trump administration, I wonder if they’re expecting something that looks like a guerrilla revolution pushing out the government in one fell swoop or just aren’t paying attention, because there has, in fact, been a tremendous amount and variety of resistance and opposition and it’s mattered tremendously. When will it be enough is a question that can only be answered if and when all this is over and we find out what comes next. Another source of disappointment seems to come from the expectation that there will be some sort of obvious and logical building up toward regime change, rather than the reality that tipping points in particular and histories in general are unpredictable animals.Resistance is everywhere, both geographically and in terms of the constituencies participating: civil society and civil servants; human rights, climate and environmental groups (who in many cases had plans in place before the election and hit the ground running when the new administration came in); religious leaders and institutions, elected officials at all levels from city councils to the US Senate, the military, lawyers and judges, educators and students, librarians, of course, medical professionals, journalists, editors and publishers, people in the arts. Of course there’s been shameful collaboration, submission and silence from many figures in most of these constituencies as well. It has been striking that the most wealthy and theoretically most powerful have, in this crisis, often been the first to surrender. It’s non-elites who have stood on principle even when it means taking risks.It wasn’t clear beforehand what the focal point of opposition would be, and the early protests against Doge and the Tesla Takedown actions were in response to the administration and Musk’s attacks on the federal government. Though activists and organizations are defending everything from renewable energy to reproductive rights, the heart of active resistance is now solidarity with those under attack by the border patrol, ICE and the other agencies assigned to terrorize, brutalize, kidnap and violate rights across the country. This manifests in myriad ways from volunteers striving to protect immigrants and refugees when they show up for their immigration-court appointments to neighbors walking kids to school when their parents are afraid to leave home to the lively protests in front of ICE in Portland, Oregon, and the extraordinary neighborhood activism across Los Angeles, and then Washington DC, and then Chicago.As Sarah Conwayreportedin New York Magazine: “In their free time, or, in some cases, by actively taking time off work, everyday Chicagoans are building rapid-response teams to keep eyes on the streets and follow the movements of federal agents. Some pass out whistles in bars and laundromats; others keep vigil outside Home Depots and taquerías. Activists have begun locating agents’ suburban hotels and hosting noisy protests outside. Some take shifts patrolling their neighborhoods on foot, in cars, and on bikes to alert neighbors to the presence of federal agents and to document their aggressive tactics and arrests.”The Catholic church has shown up, from a midwestern church that put cardboard silhouettes in the pews to represent members of the congregation afraid to attend to Chicago-bornPope Leo XIV. The new pope, seemingly in direct opposition to loud-about-his-Catholic-conversionJD Vance, has repeatedly spoken up for immigrants and the poor. It’s not just Catholics, though: ministers and rabbis have participated in protests, and more than 200 Chicago-area clergy signed a letter titled Jesus is Being Tear Gassed at Broadview. Many cities have reaffirmed their statuses as sanctuary cities and their policies of not cooperating with Ice.Miles Bruner, in resigning from his job as a Republican fundraiser,wrotein the Bulwark: “I quit the Republican party and my job as an accomplice to the party in the throes of an authoritarian cult.” Marine Col Doug Krugmanexplainedhis resignation from the military in the Washington Post: “Instead of trying to work within the Constitution, or to amend it, President Trump is testing how far he can ignore it.” The admiral who resigned abruptly from the navy’s southern command last month did not give a reason, but it was widely assumed to be in response to the murderous attacks on small boats in the Caribbean. The veterans group About Facelauncheda campaign on the Fourth of July to support military members refusing illegal orders and encouraging them to do so.Boycotts have always been a powerful tactic of nonviolent resistance. The Tesla, Target and Disney boycotts all had an effect, and Indivisible has justlaunchedone against Spotify for running Ice recruitment ads. The Disney boycott seems to be why late-night hostJimmy Kimmelgot reinstated after being pushed out for making mild remarks after far-right activistCharlie Kirkwas assassinated. Often acts of submission to the administration provoke their own acts of resistance, as when individual lawyers left some of the big law firms that caved to the administration early this year. A lot of journalists have left the Washington Post and other publications that have shifted right to go independent, and small, alternative and independent media have been a vital part of keeping the public informed and engaged.Indivisible has grown hugely in chapters and membership since the new administration took over, 50501 was founded soon after the inauguration to organize more activism and a number of other local and national resistance organizations have sprung up. Trump has called the resistance and progressives more generally “the enemy from within”. But the enemies of human rights, the rule of law, the balance of powers and the constitution, of voting rights and fair elections, of science and history, are in the partially demolished White House. If this country has a future, it’s in the streets, the courts, the movements and the continued exercise of free speech and freedom of assembly against this administration.Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

Of course not – he just knows faith sellsSimon TisdallIn a bid to exercise absolute power, today’s crop of authoritarian leaders is recruiting – and exploiting – believersSun 9 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Nov 2025 08.13 ESTShareDonald Trump’s crusading threat toinvade Nigeriaand save Christians from Islamist terrorists is typical attention-seeking. Surely even he must realise that unilateral US military intervention wouldinvite disaster. And he’s got his facts wrong. The threat of Islamist terrorism is real, but itaffects Nigerian Muslimsas much, if not more, than Christians. There’s no evidence of genocide, contrary to the alarmist claims of US far-right internet warriors. Trump’s intervention was about politics, not faith.In speaking out, he was massaging a key domestic constituency, not acting from genuine, God-fearing concern for “our cherished Christians” in a land he’s never visited.Christian nationalist votes helped clinchTrump’s two presidential victories despite the obvious insincerity of his professed beliefs. His support among white evangelical Protestants is much higher than the average – 72% in April, compared with 40% among all US adults. Trump’s histrionics about Nigeria were primarily for their (and his) benefit.Cynical efforts by political leaders to harness and exploit religious sentiment are as old as human society. Through his conversion, the fourth-century Roman emperor Constantine co-opted the rising power ofChristianity. Medieval popes battled European monarchs who presumed to rule by divine right. England’s King Henry VIII, a self-worshipping misogynist like Trump, even invented his own (Anglican) church. Until 1946, Japan’s Shinto emperor counted himself a living god. The House of Saud gained in authority from overseeing Islam’s holiest sites. And given the way he behaves, Iran’s ageing supreme leader must surely have a direct line to Allah.Today’s generation of secular authoritarian leaders is similarly intent on exercising absolute power. They, too, are eager for the legitimisation, influence and leverage established religions can offer. They also demand obedience and subservience from the faithful, the more so now due to anaccelerating global religious revivalfor which their sinful earthly depredations are partly responsible.Take Vladimir Putin. The personification of evil in Ukrainian eyes, he has successfullyrecruited the Russian Orthodox churchto his cause. Its primate, Kirill, “Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus”, enthusiastically endorses Putin’s neo-imperial ambition to restore the so-called “Russian world” and reinforce “traditional” conservative values. For Kirill, Ukraine is a “holy war”. The late Pope Francis called him “Putin’s altar boy”.Narendra Modi operates on an altogether higher plane. His seductively mystical conflation of Hinduism, India’s majority religion, with his chauvinist brand of ultra-nationalism has won him three consecutive terms as prime minister. Supporters say he has divine powers. Critics say amessianic personality cultis undermining democracy. Amid rising anti-minority hate speech, India’s 200 million Muslims recall the2002 pogrom in Gujarat,when Modi was chief minister, and pray it’s not repeated.Compared with Modi, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s Islamist populist president, has feet of clay – the Book of Daniel’s biblical metaphor for a kingdom lacking firm foundations. For more than 20 years, the “new sultan” haschipped awayat secular shibboleths governing public life, education and the wearing of headscarves. Fears that heplans a new Islamist constitutionfuel the latest backlash. Turkey’s experience shows how dangerously divisive and undemocratic the politicising of faith can be.If they’re unable to co-opt believers, authoritarian states seek to control or suppress them. China isone of the worst. Under Xi Jinping, leader of the officially atheist Communist party, religious persecution has increased significantly. Muslims in Xinjiang and Buddhists in Tibet suffer appalling abuses. Last month saw arenewed crackdownon unauthorised Christian “house churches”. A 2016 Xi diktat requires the “Sinicisation” of all religions.The reported worldwide revival in religious observance and spiritual practice poses a challenge to authoritarian exploitation and political control, and comes in direct reaction to it. In the US, where Trump routinely pits Christians and Jews against Muslims (behaviour seen again in last week’sNew York mayoral election),a recent survey found 31% of respondents believereligion is gaining influencein American life – the highest figure for 15 years. And 59% welcome the change.In the UK, churchattendance is growing, especially among young men, after years of decline, a Bible Society poll indicated. Similar trends are evident among European Catholics, withgen Z setting the pace. In France, baptisms of 18- to 25-year-olds havemore than quadrupledsince 2021. Likewise, globally,attendance at Shinto shrinesand Buddhist retreats is reportedly up. In Turkey and India, too, the politicisation of religion has increased engagement among younger people. Some reject it, others embrace it.Numerous factorsexplain the resurgent interest in established belief systems. Economic insecurity and an impersonal, digitalised world exacerbate social isolation, feeding a need for belonging, meaning, community and identity. Today’s global hellscape of war, conflict and want is frightening; faith may vanquish fear. Demographic change, including migration, boosts church and mosque congregations in countries such as the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But having seen Mia for almost half a year now, I know she masks the truth behind her polished facade, and I notice the subtle tension in her shoulders that gives it away.Mia tells me that the night before, she had poured herself “just one glass of wine” to unwind after a long day. One glass became two, then three. It’s a pattern she has grown used to; a quiet ritual that helps her “switch off” from the racing thoughts that flood her mind when the day finally slows down.Mia’s story reflects what I have been seeing at a growing rate in my practice. As a psychotherapist, I have noticed a striking pattern: an increasing number of Australians who are turning to alcohol to manage theiranxiety.According to research, 34.9% of Australian adults who drank alcohol did so to relieve stress and 18.5% to deal with anxiety.The ‘immoral, unthinkable’ political dispute rupturing a friendship requires a delicate therapeutic approach I Bianca DennyRead moreWe are living in a time of what psychologists call global distress exposure. Never have we been so constantly reminded of crisis, conflict and instability. Even when we switch off our screens, the worries remain of financial strain, job insecurity, climate fears and the emotional fatigue that comes with feeling so powerless.For many, a drink at the end of the day becomes a quiet escape. Yet while alcohol may seem to offer short-term relief,it can worsen anxietyover time, disrupting sleep, heightening physiological stress and eroding emotional resilience.Research showsthat people experiencing anxiety are significantly more likely to drink at risky levels and that the relationship between the two often becomes cyclical: anxiety fuels drinking and drinking fuels anxiety.Left unchecked, anxiety can do more than cause worry. It can disrupt relationships, affect sleep and lead to harmful coping behaviours such as substance use or compulsive online habits. Early awareness is crucial. That’s why it’s important to take a moment to reflect on one’s own anxiety and recognise the signs before they become overwhelming.One of theonline anxiety self-assessmentsavailable can help people identify how their worries might be affecting their wellbeing. It’s not a diagnosis but a first step: a quiet space to check in with yourself, understand what’s happening beneath the surface and consider whether extra support could help. Sometimes that self-reflection is the beginning of real change.The truth is, we can’t turn off the world’s crises. But we can learn to listen to what our minds and bodies are telling us when the noise becomes too much.Anxiety, in its own way, is a signal that something within us needs care. Understanding it is the first step to easing it.In an age of endless updates, perhaps the most radical act of self-preservation is this: pause, breathe and take stock of your own state of mind. If the world feels overwhelming, don’t face it alone; seek support, talk to someone or take that small step of self-assessment. Sometimes, that pause can be the beginning of feeling safe again.*All clients discussed are fictional amalgamsDiane Young is a trauma specialist and psychotherapist atSouth Pacific Private, a trauma, addiction and mental health treatment centreIn Australia, support is available at Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636, Lifeline on 13 11 14, and at MensLine on 1300 789 978.

Here, unfortunately, was the essence of the event’s absurdity: as if to confirm people’s most cynical views of politics, she served notice that she is about to do something hugely significant, but refused to explicitly say what it is.But thanks to nods, winks and the usual anonymous briefings, what she was signalling was obvious: she could no longer honour her party’s manifesto pledge not to raise national insurance, VAT or income tax – and that, in a gambitlast tried bya chancellor in 1975, the basic rate of the last is likely to go up.If that happens, it will be a massively dangerous moment. Whatever sweeteners are offered and however much ministers might point to additional measures that will hit higher earners, one of the few memorable promises made at the last election will have been broken. The move, moreover, will confirm something that I see and hear whenever I go out reporting: the fact that millions of people resent the feeling of paying more and more for less and less. The public’s already woeful levels of trust in traditional politics will probably reach a new low, with potentially seismic consequences – and not just for Reeves and her party.The essential pointwas madea few days before Reeves’s speech by Luke Tryl, the UK director of the thinktank and research organisation More In Common, and someone with an incisive understanding of where we have arrived. “I still don’t think enough people realise how much traditional mainstream politics is in the last chance saloon, in no small part because it can’t be trusted to deliver what it promises,” he said on X. “Already the combined Green/Reform vote is higher than [the] Tory/Labour vote – previously unthinkable.”We are, in other words, in the middle of a huge fragmentation-cum-realignment, which Reeves, Keir Starmer and their colleagues seem only to be accelerating. Reform UK’s lead in thepolls will soon be a year old. The Green party seems to have recently drawn level with Labour – and, in at leastone recent case, pulled slightly ahead. The Liberal Democrats are rarely far behind. The Tories, who got 43% of the vote in 2019, are now also in the mid-teens. Factor in Plaid Cymru’screditable ratingsin Wales and therevival of the SNPin Scotland, and the picture is complete (for now).The truth is that a trend of turbulence and insurgency has been gaining pace for years. If you wanted to take a very long view, you couldgo back to 1974, and two general elections when the old Liberal party got nearly 20% of the poll, there were Plaid breakthroughs and, in the second contest, the SNP won nearly a third of the vote in Scotland. But the clearest story goes back about a decade. In the wake of Ukip winning nearly 4m votes in the 2015 general election, the vote for Brexit told the same story even more spectacularly. In turn, that led on to the wild swings that turned so many Labour heartlands blue in 2019 , and the defining facts of last year’s election: advances for Reform, the Greens and the Lib Dems, and a Labour win secured with the support ofonly 20%– 20%! – of the total electorate.Why is all this happening? Clearly, the reasons run much deeper than the charisma and agility of Nigel Farage and the Greens’ new leader,Zack Polanski, and the comparatively leaden vibes of Starmer, Reeves and Kemi Badenoch. Though the country’s stagnating condition is massively relevant, the fundamental reasons also go beyond an economy and society that have sat basically unchanged since the financial crash of 2008, and the failures of the various administrations that have run the UK since.Fundamentally, politics is fast-changing and multifaceted mainly because modern human beings are – and in the absence of the kind of institutional guardrails that preserve the two-party system in the US, voters’ choices reflect their lives. People’s identities are complicated – something intensified by the means of communication we still clunkily call social media. There will, therefore, be no going back to a majoritarian politics in which most voters loyally choose one of two archaic teams. All that has gone. What hasn’t yet occurred to most politicians is that the same applies to people in suits spouting cliches about “hardworking families”, the daily (legacy) media round, “pitch-rolling” speeches and all of Westminster’s other outmoded rituals.In the face of that huge change, the Tories andLabourhave a lot in common. They carry on in the hope that 20th-century politics can somehow be revived, and behave as if something is terribly wrong when the old ways don’t work. On the current evidence, despite the fact that this is clearly no time for unforced errors, they have also responded to transformed realities with panic, and a governing style that tends to mix complacency with ineptitude.Labour has not, of course, got anywhere near the Liz Truss catastrophe – indeed, Reeves’s core principle is the avoidance of anything even remotely similar. But after less than 18 months in power, it is now indelibly the party thatgot in a terrible messover the winter fuel allowance, and then fell into theup-the-hill-then-down-againfarce of its proposed cuts to disability benefits. Amazingly, it still has no coherent narrative it can call on when it collides with completely predictable difficulties – such as the need to break a rash promise on tax that it was probably never going to be able to keep. We now learn that itslast electoral hopemay lie in people tactically voting en masse against Reform, and the belief that, as one insider put it last week, “even if they hate us, they hate Farage more”. That is pitiful, and a sign that Labour may simply not be able to cope with the 21st century.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That would be a waking nightmare, but there is one ray of hope. One of the key elements of the political mood is the sense of a constant, bitter revolt against power, and the fact that incumbency is the worst political look of all. If today’s insurgents and troublemakers become tomorrow’s ruling establishment, the turbulence and complexity they feed off will soon come for them too. That is an indication of what the modern political cycle really is: a twisted wheel, spinning faster than any of us yet understand.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionGeneral election 2024Rachel ReevesIncome taxLabourReform UKZack PolanskicommentShareReuse this content"

What if that’s a good thing?Hanna Thomas UoseAuthors are sounding warnings about the length of the modern attention span, but my series of abandonments is a sign of something elseSun 9 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Nov 2025 13.51 ESTShareThis is embarrassing, but here goes. There are five novels beside my bed, all partially read. On my phone, I am partway through 36 audiobooks, which pales in comparison to the 46 ebooks I have abandoned on my Kindle. This doesn’t count the growing pile of advance copies beside my coffee table, vying for blurbs, now that I am a published novelist myself.At first glance, these stats seem to corroborate Ian Rankin’s words. Commentinga fortnight agoon how easy it is to lose a reader’s focus, when it is fragmented by social media and the news cycle, the writer said: “Maybe as people’s attention spans change the literature will have to change with them.” But as someone who used to doggedly finish whatever I was reading, I now consider it a human right to put down a book that I’m not in the mood for.I don’t believe that this habit is due to my short attention span – rather more to the feeling of life slipping through my fingers. I’ve always been struck by the Benedictine teaching: “Keep death daily before your eyes.” Oliver Burkeman’s reminder that we each have a mere4,000 weekson this Earth was as horrifying to me as to anyone else. And yet at what other point in human history have we ever had such immediate access to so many mind-blowing works of art, whenever we want? A glut of riches awaits me in every bookshop and behind every screen, and I want to be intentional about where I direct my attention. Could “DNF-ing” a novel (shorthand in the book world for Did Not Finish) be not a sign of a weak mind, but a discerning one?Especially at a time when publishing (and therefore, commissioning) is still dominated by a certain social class and its quandaries. While reading about people different from ourselves can help tobuild the muscle for empathy, we also read to reflect on our own lives and place in the world. Until the books on the shelves better reflect the identities, lives and concerns of potential readers, it might be very hard to hold their attention.Of course, some authorsaresuccessfully writing for the “modern attention span”: the tweet-length prose of Patricia Lockwood’sNo One Is Talking About This,the tight fragments of Jenny Offill’sDept. of Speculation, and the short chapters of Chris Whitaker’sAll the Colours of the Darkare all a wonderful showcase for a shorter form and style. And there is no shortage of writing advice geared toward grabbing a reader: hone that first sentence, polish that opening chapter, elevate the stakes (higher! higher!) and, if writing crime, put a dead body on the first page. This is all sound advice – a potential agent, publisher or reader will spend only a few precious minutes deciding whether or not to forge ahead. There is no point in being contrary, like the person on a writing course I attended who, when challenged about the plot of their novel, declared that “it all becomes clear about three-quarters of the way through”. No writer should put their reader through a series of 12 labours in order to be understood.And I do write to be understood, as much as that is possible. Sometimes that requires holding the reader’s hand, guiding them through the story beat by economical beat. Sometimes, I’ve realised, understanding takes patience – and I must give myself (and other writers) the grace of meandering, of layering, of digressing, until I hit upon something true. Jane Alison, author of the craft book Meander, Spiral, Explodeargues for the novel finding new forms and that, rather than the traditional dramatic arc, “other patterns might help us imagine new ways to make our narratives vital and true, keep making our novels novel”.In that sense, Rankin and Alison both agree – the novel may have to change to accommodate the modern reader, as it has continually done since it first emerged in the 18th century (in the form that we know it today). Perhaps, like Charles Dickens and Helen Fielding, authors will go back to serialising their novels in the newspapers. The next such authors may already be releasing their work, chapter by chapter, on online platforms such asWattpad, visited by more than 90 million monthly users. Art forms change with the times and we should let them.But let us not say that any changes are all because of shorter attention spans. If that was so, short story collections and flash fiction would be considered much more commercial bets than they are now. And, if we were to follow that argument to its endpoint, the answer may be not to write at all – to admit defeat against VR and AI-generated content in the battle for attention, and let the robots take over. I trust that is not what Rankin, or what most of us, want.Personally, I am more worried about the implications of the “modern attention span” for my own ability to write, rather than read. After this, I will go and flip my sand timer while sitting on a silent Zoom call with six other authors, hoping that their diligent typing will successfully spur me on with my second book. And should a newspaper ever want a serialised novel? They know where to find me.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Argonauts author turns her lens on poetry, pop and patriarchyArifa AkbarSun 9 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTShareMaggie Nelson is an unapologetic Taylor Swift fan. She knows the discography, drops song lyrics into conversation and tells me she took her family to the Vancouver leg of the Eras tour. So she’s a dyed-in-the-wool Swiftie? Nelson seems not entirely comfortable with the breathless connotations of that term but yes, the love is real. So much so, she has written a book about the billionaire singer-songwriter, or rather, a joint analysis of Swift andSylvia Plath, who recurs in much of Nelson’s oeuvre.The notion of uniting these two cultural titans, who are seemingly poles apart in sensibility – one a melancholic American poet, the other an all-American poster girl – came to her when she heard Swift’s 2024 album,The Tortured Poets Department. Alongside its literary references to F Scott Fitzgerald, Dylan Thomas and Shakespeare, there are heavy resonances of Plath in its introspection and emotional tumult. But the book only started to take shape after a chat with her 13-year-old son’s friend, Alba. “We were making bracelets and she said ‘Have you ever heard of Sylvia Plath?’ I thought that was funny because I’d written my undergraduate thesis on Plath and I was [almost] 40 years older than her. So I said: ‘Ihaveheard of Sylvia Plath.’ As I sat there, I thought, these kids don’t want to hear me talk on this topic but I have a lot to say because I’ve been thinking of it all.”From that clarifying moment came The Slicks, a book-sized extended essay that is, sweetly, dedicated to Alba. Nelson has written about pop musicians before: there were reflections on Prince and Björk inLike Love. Here she makes a case for Swift as poet as well as lyricist. “She has songwriting moving through her,” she says, referring to the star’s hydrant gush of productivity. “Like Plath said, the blood jet is poetry, there’s no stopping it.”Nelson makes work from the blood jet too. She was a poet before she took to nonfiction and turned it into her own idiosyncratic brand of formally experimental art, sometimes written in what appears like hybrid verse-prose. She has gathered an enormous fan following with books such asBluets, a mournful paean to the colour blue, and her memoir,The Argonauts, about mothering, family and queerness.View image in fullscreenFan-girling … Maggie Nelson.Photograph: Bridgeman ImagesNow, it’s Nelson doing the fan-girling. Sitting backstage at the Edinburgh international book festival at the end of August, she has a scrubbed-faced informality and ease about her. What is it about Swift that appeals to children and celebrated writers alike? “I think one of the most beautiful things about theTaylor Swiftphenomenon has been the celebration of her creativity and her power … She’s modelling for these people (a lot of girls, but not all girls) a form of fame, being proud of yourself and proud of what you’ve done.”Fame, and its relationship to women, is the nub of the book. Those who want it with a clench-jawed desperation but never get it (Plath killed herself, never knowing how famous she would become), those who have it in dazzling abundance (Swift), and those who abjure it entirely (the reclusive poet Emily Dickinson).Neither Plath nor Swift hid their ambitions; both aimed for stratospheric fame. The shadow of a third, unnamed, ambitious woman looms over The Slicks, that ofKamala Harriswho, according to Nelson, takes a more covert tack. “I was writing the essay the entire way up to the election [which Harris lost] and there was almost a heart-in-your-throat kind of way of writing through it. A lot of people made this point about Harris – that she didn’t ever say ‘I want it’. It was given to her by [Joe] Biden standing down. There was something about that which obviated the entire problem of ‘I want this big thing’. I thought that was fascinating. I heard some people saying ‘Well, that’ll give her a better chance because if she actually wanted it, people would hate her for it.’”So the book aims an arrow against the deep-seated cultural belief that flagrantly announced female ambition – and expression – warrants punishment. This is where Swift’s brazen wanting it, and getting it, comes in. Her productivity and profile is analysed by way of ancient Greece as well as Freud’s theories on the female “hysteric”. This history is underpinned by the misogynistic assumption that women who excavate their personal lives for their art are somehow cheapening themselves. Shutting these loud women up is a part of the patriarchal project, suggests Nelson, even now. “There’s something about wanting, and naming your want – which I think both Plath and Swift did – that is still generally a punishing sphere for a woman.”It is not so dissimilar to the judgments that sometimes orbit Nelson’s intimate, boundary-blurring nonfiction, or more generally memoirs written by female writers. “It would not be a hot take to say in the field of autobiography, women have a different time of it,” Nelson says. “We’re somehow considered ethical guardians for our children, our parents, for people that we know. The idea of making revelations for the sake of art is much more ethically freighted because women aren’t supposed to take those kinds of liberties without deeply considering every other factor of how everything they do might affect somebody else.”I came up in the queer and punk world – I’m interested in who gets to be a part of the mainstreamThe Slicks sits adjacent to another book Nelson published this year,Pathemata: Or, the Story of My Mouth. Its title (taken from the Greek for “suffering”), she points out, carries distant echoes of Plath’s words: “I don’t want to mouth other people, I want other people to mouth me.” The mouth being peered into here, though, is Nelson’s own. It is memoir mixed with dreamscapes: Nelson’s own chronic and inexplicable pain in the jaw but also the broader failings of healthcare, and maybe even the collective pain of the Covid pandemic.Her creativity felt crushed by the experience of lockdown, she feared she would never write again, so the book was conceived inadvertently, as a playful diversion from the blank page: “I thought I would mess around with ugly content that I would never publish.”Some of its source material came from a pain diary she had kept for over a decade: a log of her innumerable doctors’ visits, medications and therapies alongside their outcomes – hope raised and dashed, all codified on her desktop. She had also started writing down her dreams, and those two files collided to form the premise of Pathemata. “I thought these documents would be hilarious to marry. So I began amusing myself with a pastiche project … A lot of people who have read it have said ‘I was so mad on the diseased speaker’s behalf.’ But I was very aware of a certain genre of diagnosis and complaint. I was trying to think ‘What’s the next station past that where I could arrive?’”It may not be laugh-out-loud funny, but there is awkward humour and a quietly incendiary absurdism to the probes and promises made by dentists, doctors, alternative therapists and “gurus”. “Maybe because I live in California I’m more tolerant … I think a lot of these people truly believe they’re trying to help. To me, there’s more pathos in them thinking they could help. And for anybody in chronic pain there’s a kind of shame spiral where you want to be the patient who comes back in three weeks and says ‘I did all that and I feel so much better and you’re great’. When you feel yourself drifting into the category of unhelpable, that’s a very sad space for both [patient and doctor].”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

She references Plath “burning away all the peripherals” in her pithiness, leaving no unnecessary word on the page; Nelson could be seen to be striving for that same elemental reduction. Yet paradoxically, she remembers “copious speaking” as an unstoppably talkative child. How has she become so spare on paper? Through “tonnes” of editing, she says. “I began as a poet where you do long sessions of outpourings and then you literally carve … You’re hacking off to get it into a form, so I probably do something similar. I was making this book [Pathemata] so small I kept telling myself ‘Don’t whittle it away to nothing.’”So she really is burning away all the peripheries? “Yeah, I think so. Although in The Slicks I defend Taylor Swift’s excess.” We’re back to the singer, who in some ways presents her own paradox in Nelson’s literary life. As a spangly all-American starlet, along with her famed business acumen and lean-in feminism, she is a creature of the mainstream, while Nelson resides in a far more leftfield space. That, she says, is exactly the appeal: “Part of the joy is to be brought to something that, compared to the world I came up in, which was more queer and punk, is very norm-core … Insisting on being there for it is a way of continuing to insist you are part of this culture.”The example she gives is of the Super Bowl, now synonymous with Swift and her footballer fiance, Travis Kelce, but also the heartland of popular American culture. “I like football so I was watching it but there were these anti-trans commercials that Trump was running. We were having a party to watch the game and it was signalling that ‘this isn’t for you’. I’m interested in who gets to be a part of this mainstream. I’m not willing to give that up.”Living amid Trumpian politics and the contested ground of trans identity within her family – she lives in California with a son and a gender nonconforming partner, the artist Harry Dodge – must carry its own dissonance? “It’s not terrible for my family right now, but it is shifting sands every day in which vulnerable bodies are going to be brutalised,” she says, building to a politely voiced outrage. “I care a lot about freedom. I’m not going to be lectured about it by people intent on taking it away. I wrote a book about it [On Freedom], about the two biggest discourses in the States: one about the abolition of slavery/civil rights, and the other one from white supremacists. They’ve always been present in the States.”Is America currently dealing with white supremacy? “Do you mean Trump? Sure. It’s very obvious what we’re in here.” Perhaps the capacity for joy that Nelson describes Swift as channelling in her music is a necessary light to fend off this darkness. To that end, will Nelson go to aLife of a Showgirlconcert? It will depend on whether her son is still a Swift fan, she says, but also if she can justify the cost of the tickets. Last year, she did a direct trade-off against a book licence she sold, for Bluets, which was adapted into a play in London. “I had wanted to take my son and his friend to the Eras tour but it was too expensive. I was on the fence about licensing the play, but then I realised it was about the same cost to take everyone to the tour. In Taylor Swift’s spirit, I thought I’ll sell it and go to the show.”So, she laughs, if that happens again, she’ll be there for Showgirl. Swiftonomics indeed.Pathemata: Or, the Story of My Mouth by Maggie Nelson is published by Fern (£12.99). The Slicks will be published on 13 November (Fern).

She and the drama’s creators discuss the challenges of staging masturbation, and getting audiences to relate to its troubled leadSun 9 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTShareIn Sophia Chetin-Leuner’s Porn Play, which has just opened at London’s Royal Court, Ani is a 30-year-old academic at the frontier of intellectual discovery: she’s winning awards for her radical revision of John Milton’s Paradise Lost, effortlessly earning the admiration of her mentor and her students alike. She’s also addicted to violent pornography and is masturbating constantly. She can’t stay in a real-life sexual moment, but she can’t stay in a real-life conversation, either – constantly reaching for her phone, watching porn and wanking, often in situations just about believable yet so outlandishly wrong that reading the play, and observing Ani’s career and relationships unravel, is like being trapped in someone’s anxiety dream.So it’s quite a bold choice of role for the person playing Ani,Ambika Mod. Since starring in This Is Going to Hurt in 2022, but even more so since One Day last year, she has become known, in her words, “for playing very noble characters who die”. Mod has the world of romantic leads at her feet – a beautiful, relatable everywoman, who could tell you the truth of the human heart with one raised eyebrow. Starring in a play whose opening scene has her on all fours atop a mirror, in a frenzy of narcissistic delight, whose every action is centred on her body … well, it feels like it must have been a decision to wrestle with?“This is going to make me sound really crazy,” Mod says, “but actually no. My initial thoughts when I read the script were: ‘What a fucking great play, what a fucking great character, what an interesting thing that I’ve never seen before.’”View image in fullscreenClose reading … Ambika Mod and Will Close in rehearsals for Porn Play.Photograph: Helen MurrayChetin-Leuner started writing Porn Play eight years ago, while she was on a scholarship at Tisch School of the Arts at NYU. She has a sweet, soft voice and demeanour, which seem almost comical when all you know of her is her play’s caustic dialogue. She says she wanted to write about porn, broadly, because “the internet has just ruined what, in essence, could be a really gorgeous exploration of different kinks. When you’re 12, which is the age that children start looking at pornography online now, the way algorithms work is they might start with one thing, but then it pushes more and more violence. By the time people are becoming sexually active, they’ve absorbed so much that it’s shaped their idea of intimacy, their sexual preferences, everything.”Some of the details in the play that might sound madly embellished – Ani has to go to the GP because she’s masturbated so much that she’s done herself a mischief – are actually drawn from real-life porn addicts Chetin-Leuner interviewed while she was in the US. Plenty has been written about this addiction, but almost all of it through a male lens, while in her research she found that women were much more likely than men to watch violent pornography (though it’s low single digits for either gender to search for non-consensual violence,according to the most often-cited study).But how on earth do you stage a play like this? Masturbation is such a private thing. Across the whole spectrum of possible ways you could portray it – from grotesque to erotic – there is something about turning that privacy inside out that is so confrontational as to amount to a kind of violence.Josie Rourke, the play’s director, is one of those people who you take one look at and think, “OK, she’s got this”, given her previous work as artistic director at London’s Donmar Warehouse theatre and, before that, the Bush. “One of the nice things about having been a theatre director for a couple of decades is that it’s possible for me to look at a scene very practically, thinking about how it’s going to be delivered,” she says. “Your brain is thinking: ‘How do we do that?’ using exactly the same technical bits that you’d use for, ‘How are we going to kill Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet?’”This isn’t Rourke’s first rodeo, which she illustrates with even less stageable moments in her career than 24/7 masturbation. In her 20s she directed Loyal Women, a play about the women’s wing of the Ulster Defence Association, in which someone had to be tarred and feathered. “There’s always another question, beyond ‘How do you get it to deliver?’, which is: ‘How do you make it eloquent?’” she says. “Although what occurs in the play is extremely graphic, how do we have the audience feellikethe character, and not like they’re observing the character?”From Mod’s perspective, the challenge is part of the point. “Especially as a brown woman, you feel the push towards meekness, towards sexlessness, towards being a good girl. A personal desire of mine is that I want more mess in the characters I play, in the stories I tell.”It’s still on my mind that audiences might revolt. Ten years ago, I covered the scandal at the Royal Opera House, when there was nudity and a rape scene in Guillaume Tell, and the audience booed, people walked out. Rourke is unperturbed about this prospect, partly because the Royal Court is well known for pushing at boundaries, whether those are of decency, taste or simply the frame of what does and does not belong on stage. “Some people walked out of Look Back in Anger,” Rourke says (if you’ve forgotten the fine details, audience members audibly gasped at the sight of an ironing board on stage).“It’s not about sensationalism, it’s about this being a theatre you come to to understand what is occurring in the world, that may reach beyond our own experience. Tough stuff happens here.”And truly, Porn Play is about more than the impact of porn: how it flattens, homogenises, abstracts and finally disembodies sex, as it removes you from the world and the people in it. That is a backdrop, really, to other, searching questions in the play: about shame and grief; kink and authenticity; God and the patriarchy; Milton; Adam and Eve; addiction and relationships; how different generations bounce off each other.A lot of research on addiction, isn’t it always a search for love, for connection and intimacy?Ambika ModIndeed, part of Ani’s unravelling as an academic actually isn’t because she’s watching porn all day; it’s because she hits the hard edge of one of her gen Z student’s boundaries by describing rape as “sexy”. Arguing thatshewasn’t calling it sexy, she was considering whether Milton was, does nothing to soften the exchange. It’s a perfect distillation of the condition of millennial womanhood; the first generation to have porn omnipresent through their sexual awakening, they’re policed by the conservatism of their elders, which still sees sexual destiny as a guy thing, while at the same time, the generation beneath them is more militant about consent, abuse, trauma and trigger warnings. The space in which millennial women can discuss desire is vanishingly small, and full of landmines.“We are not given the grace of nuance and complexity in any of our discussions,” Mod says – born in 1995, she is, like Ani, almost too young to be a millennial, but just too old for gen Z, which technically started in 1997. “It feels so healthy to sit in the swirl of this play, because outside it, binaries are becoming stronger and stronger. In the same way that pornography is very harmful, social media is also fucking us up.”View image in fullscreenGlass action … Ambika Mod in rehearsals for Porn Play.Photograph: Helen MurrayBesides tearing up what you can and can’t say, Porn Play might also upend what you thought about Milton – classic patriarch, in art and in life, a man so violently domineering that his first wife left him because she couldn’t stand the sound of him beating his students over Latin grammar. Ani argues that in his portrait of Eve, in Paradise Lost, her worship of the serpent is essentially penis worship – her self-love is indivisible from her sexuality, and the fall is worth it. So the poem doesn’t just allow for female desire, it frames it as elementally powerful. If you squint a bit, Porn Play recasts Milton as a feminist sexual adventurer and philosopher of kink.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWas that Chetin-Leuner’s intention? She approaches this obliquely: “I was talking to a lot of recovering sex and porn addicts, and loads of it was about religion,” she says. “They’d either come from really religious backgrounds, or they’d found religion as part of their recovery. I didn’t want to do a play about that, but I understood there’s something about the ultimate patriarch, God …” she tails off, I’m guessing because the thought ends somewhere blasphemous from both a religious and feminist perspective. “Anyway, that’s where Milton came in: he has this great quality, where his poetry shifts beneath your feet. Is he a proto-feminist or a horrible arsehole? Probably both.”Mod was raised a Hindu but isn’t particularly religious now, though she is spiritual. “We decided for Ani that she would have that same background and heritage, but I wanted to be really clear that I didn’t want her specialism in academia to be in any way tied to her own faith,” she says. Rourke was raised Roman Catholic, and says this play has uncovered “a childhood and teens that were spent being told how to worship, how to think about my body. The church needed to sit in between me and those ideas, not just in between me and God.“I think a lot about original sin,” she continues. “Is there a thing we can’t get out of ourselves? That we’re continually trying to? It makes immediate sense to people who went through that doctrine, and no sense at all to people who didn’t: you are told that there is this sin that you carry around from birth. There’s something about that that I find so evocative and profound.”In the end, the porn addiction is just that, an addiction: some of the most powerful scenes are the tragic, ugly loneliness of the addict, and the hero’s journey is, Mod says, “trying to get Ani to interact with the real world. Trying to get her back to a place where she remembered that she was loved. I don’t want to sound really pedestrian, but a lot of research on addiction, isn’t it always a search for love, for connection and intimacy?”‘I spoke complete twaddle for four minutes’: Meera Syal, Larry Lamb and more on the terror of stage frightRead moreBut Ani’s arc is so much richer than an addict’s journey back into the world of healthy, responsible adults. Her basest instincts are interlaced throughout with her most truthful, her ugliest moments slide in and out of her noblest. Mod, Rourke and Chetin-Leuner never sound more similar than when they’re laughing about how many times they’ve been asked to make a female character more “likable”. “No one’s going, ‘Is Macbeth likable enough, though?’” Mod says. Chetin-Leuner “can’t believe people are still saying that about women in stories, but they are”. Rourke says that whenever she hears “likable” in a meeting, she says “heroic” at exactly the same time, “so that word sits above ‘likable’”.“A play is also a poetic space,” Rourke continues. “I don’t want anybody leaving Porn Play shocked and trembling; I want to open up the poetic space within their own sense of shame, their own sense of who they are. And for that, they have to have a heroic relationship to this character. She’s the hero of the play.”Porn Playis at the Royal Court theatre, London, to13 December.Explore more on these topicsAmbika ModTheatreJosie RourkeRoyal Court theatrePornographyJohn MiltoninterviewsShareReuse this content"

Now, this one-off 23,500-capacity show ahead of next year’s arena tour finds the 54-year-old northerner performing with a rocket-boosted confidence reminiscent of his 90s days in the Verve.Back then, the music press dubbed the singer “Mad Richard” for his messianic belief in music and eye-rocketing suggestion that on a good night he could fly. Thirty years later, his arsenal of moves – raining air punches on imaginary foes and so on – would alert the emergency services in any other environment. But on stage, they are ridiculously compelling.Although the opening songs are hampered by muddy sound, the perma-sunglassed singer performs as almost physically trying to transport himself and audience to a higher plane. “Who wants to go up again?” he yells, adding an extra chorus to Music Is Power. A strings section and backing vocalists turn the relatively unloved C’Mon People (We’re Making It Now) into an uplifting epic.Ashcroft is self-aware enough to caution about an approaching “slow one from the new album” and he describes Oh L’Amour as “my Charles Aznavour moment”, but croons it beautifully. His solo career has certainly had its wobbles but was built on the foundations of the Verve-era ballads that come from a deeper place than most pop. The rarely played History from 1995 is raw and wounded. The Drugs Don’t Work – generally believed to be about his father’s death – visibly moves the audience. Sonnet and Lucky Man receive such applause that the singer yells “I wish the music teacher that said I was a ‘cancer in the class’ was here to see this now”.Bitter Sweet Symphony may be 28 years old but lines such as “you’re a slave to money then you die” still clearly speak to modern Britain. A stellar nine-minute rendition sees the singer theatrically fall to his knees to illustrate the words and unleashes a vast, cathartic sing-along, with scenes resembling a gigantic Last Night of the Proms.Richard Ashcroft plays Utilita Arena, Cardiff on March 24, then toursExplore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockRichard AshcroftThe Vervelive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

It is refreshing subject matter, enacted on wheels, as a road trip that Winston (Jason Thorpe) railroads Joy (also Farino) into taking, after refitting a school bus as a camper van.Joy is a reluctant passenger, Winston a Tiggerish life coach and overbearing parent who sells the trip to her as an odyssey of discovery after tracing the family tree to County Mayo. Both are in fact seeking escape, she from her depression in the aftermath of her first big break-up, he from a legal case which involves a dead client whose grieving family hold him responsible.It is a potently confined space that enacts the Freudian drama of blame, guilt and parental harm. This rises out of the barbed exchanges on the bus and the flashbacks to the legal case in which Winston is himself receiving coaching, of sorts, by solicitor, Claire (Shona Babayemi). A third narrative prong takes us into Joy’s dream-world which is lyrical, wintry and full of ellipses.There is bristling banter and a great recurring joke about Bono between father and daughter but little else that is warm and fuzzy in their dynamic. He dominates, she acquiesces. A crash blows the roof off their bus and their relationship but before this culminating fight, there are layers of repressed or half-spoken feelings, delicately captured in the dialogue, and a surprisingly moving sing-along.It builds unequally in its three parts, gaining traction in the legal case and road-trip. The liminal aspect of Joy’s interiority has a lovely, dream-like pull but feels slightly as if it is a different play. There are other unfinished elements: Claire’s story is under-explained and reflections on Joy’s heartbreak, which is mentioned again and again, are frustratingly few.But there is deft direction from Tessa Walker and such fine performances that it becomes a pleasure to watch in its disparate parts. There is some thrilling writing here as well, both in the dialogue and Joy’s ruminative monologues. Debbie Duru’s set design brings visual poetry; the bus is just seats on wheels, its effects created by flurries of snow, light, shadow (lighting design by Christopher Nairne) and movement (by Rebecca Wield).The originality of the staging, the invigorating writing and even the oddness of the structure makes this a wonky gem of a first play.At Hampstead theatre, London, until 29 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreHampstead theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Most of the previous exhibitions have been about the ‘boys’ toys’, as I call them sometimes, somewhat facetiously – the weapons.“There have also been exhibitions, particularly inJapan, about the arts of the samurai. But this is trying to say that there’s a lot that is misunderstood and based on myth.”Recalling that the British Museum previously staged two exhibitions on samurai swords, she said: “Swords are important, but they are by no means the whole story. So this is going to be much bigger than has ever been attempted before …“What I want to address in the exhibition is the way that perception of the samurai has become narrowed down to just this male warrior in armour wielding a sword.“That’s a tiny part of what they were over hundreds of years. They were warriors in the beginning, but there was a balance between the military and the literary and the artistic. So that’s a huge part of the story.”She added: “This rediscovery of female samurai history reframes centuries of gendered myth and challenges the hyper-masculine image of the samurai that still dominates film, anime and gaming.”The samurai emerged in the 900s as mercenaries for the imperial court. They were formidable and fearsome warriors during the middle ages.They gained political dominance from the 1100s and, during a long era of peace from 1615, they became government officials, scholars and patrons of the arts. By the late 19th century, their hereditary status had been abolished as Japan modernised itself.The exhibition will feature more than 280 objects, many of which have never been seen in the UK before. It will also draw on the British Museum’s own collection – one of the largest outside Japan – whose objects are too delicate to be displayed permanently.View image in fullscreenWoman’s firefighting jacket and hood.Photograph: John C. Weber Collection/John Bigelow TaylorAs well as arms and armour, there will be paintings, woodblock prints, books, clothing and ceramics.“Because the samurai were elite, the best quality objects were made for them,” Buckland said. “Different types of clothing for samurai men and women differentiated them from the other classes in society. Most importantly, the men were allowed to wear two swords.”Exhibits to be seen for the first time include a spectacular suit of armour recently acquired by the British Museum. Its helmet and golden standard, shaped like iris leaves and coated in gold leaf, made the wearer both identifiable and fearsome.Buckland said that such suits were recycled over the centuries, reusing the robust sections from those inherited from previous generations and remaking more delicate ones such as silk sleeves, among other elements. Even away from the battlefield, a suit of armour was a status symbol.In one such exhibit, the oldest part dates from 1519, while other details were made in the early 19th century.View image in fullscreenBamboo folding fan, Watanabe Kazan.Photograph: Trustees of the British MuseumThe exhibition will reflect that the samurai enjoyed centuries of peace, with plenty of time to pursue artistic and intellectual interests. The paintings range from a cute cat depicted by a samurai lord’s wife to botanical studies.There is also a firefighting jacket that women wore while serving within Edo Castle. Fires were so common in the wooden city of Edo – present-day Tokyo – that the fires were known as the “flowers of Edo”, and this jacket’s watery motifs of tasselled anchors and waves evoke protection against the flames. High-ranking samurai were responsible for raising the alarm, supervising firefighting and evacuations.The word “samurai” is used increasingly in Japan but only because it is used by foreigners, Buckland said: “It’s difficult to unearth when it started to be used by foreigners. That was a long time ago.“But there are other words in Japanese that mean warrior or member of the military class. Literally, samurai means something like ‘subordinate’. It’s actually got quite a pejorative sense, which is why it was never previously used in Japanese.“In the early times, the word for warrior was ‘musha’ and, in the later times when the samurai were in charge of everything, they were called ‘bushi’.”Buckland observed the Japanese have imported some of the western perceptions “because it’s useful for the tourist industry”.She added: “I went to a hotel last year and was greeted by three virtual check-in receptionists, Godzilla, a geisha – and a samurai warrior.”Samuraiis at the British Museumfrom 3 Februaryto 4 May2026.

In New York they enter the shadow world of “Bad Bridgets” – sex workers, thieves, drunkards and killers.Peppiatt and his Kneecap producer Trevor Birney optioned the historians’ book, Bad Bridget: Crime, Mayhem and the Lives of Irish Emigrant Women, and will collaborate with Robbie’s production company,LuckyChap.The Oscar-winning production designer James Price and the costume designer Kate Hawley will work on the film which is to begin shooting in Ireland andNorthern Irelandnext year.“I’d like to think we’ll have loads of influence over the film, but I suspect not,” said Farrell. “It’s slightly scary because you’ve got your set ideas as historians, we think of things in particular ways. So there’s a bit of letting go.”View image in fullscreenIrish emigrants sailing to the US during the Great Famine, 1850.Photograph: Illustrated London News/Getty ImagesMcCormick said they had trustedPeppiatt, a former tabloid reportergarlanded for Kneecap, his semi-autobiographical film about the rap trio of that name. “We’ll leave the film up to Rich. He is the expert and he has amazing ideas so we’re really looking forward to seeing how it turns out.”The original academic project, funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, unpicked the conventional narrative that female Irish emigrants were domestic servants, cooks, wives and mothers with reputations for diligence and rectitude.In the 1860s, Irish people made up about a quarter of New York’s population but Irish men comprised half of the male prison population and Irish women 86% of the female prison population. A survey of 1,238 foreign-born sex workers in the city found that 706, just over half, were Irish.The research uncovered individual stories, such as that of Ellen Price, who was described as appearing in a Toronto court in 1865 “drunk as usual, with a flaming red feather in her hat”. Led away to prison, she launched into a chorus of Rocky Road to Dublin.Margaret Brown, a pickpocket known as Old Mother Hubbard, tried to escape from a Chicago prison in 1877 by tying bedsheets together but fell and was badly injured. Lizzie Halliday, originally from County Antrim, was convicted of multiple murders and became the first woman sentenced to die in New York’s electric chair, but the sentence was commuted on grounds of insanity.Fans of the book and podcast, which has just launched a second season, valued learning about this side of the Irish emigrant experience, said Farrell. “It wasn’t all good wives and mothers and nuns or teachers. There’s a slightly darker side. I don’t want to meet those women but I love that we can see their strong attitudes and their defiance.”The historians hope aspects of their “favourite Bridgets” will end up on screen but in the meantime they will continue researching and teaching. “The talk of premieres and all that is really exciting but we still have to do our day jobs,” said McCormick. Even so, they could dream of glitz, Farrell joked. “That’s our main concern, you know, what we’ll wear for the red carpet.”Explore more on these topicsPodcastsIrelandWomenMigrationHeritageEuropeNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

This richly flavoured cornerstone of the US midwest is a treat on a cold day – here’s how to perfect itFelicity CloakeSun 9 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Nov 2025 08.03 ESTShareBeer and cheese, two ingredients that don’t immediately scream soup to much of the world, are the cornerstones of one such midwestern speciality, particularly beloved in Wisconsin, with its prominent dairy and brewing industries.Beersoups are also found from Alsace to Russia (and, indeed, Wisconsin has a significant northern European heritage population). The cheese, however, appears to be an inspired American addition (though, seeing as Germany boasts both beer and cheese soups, I’m prepared to stand corrected), playing off the bittersweetness of the beer to produce a richly flavoured dish that’s perfectly suited to harsh midwestern winters. That said, it’s a treat on a cold day wherever you are.(Note: this is not to be confused with Germanobatzda, while a thicker version is a popular hot dip in Kentucky, in particular.)The baseView image in fullscreenAmerica’s Test Kitchen’s beer cheese soup doubles down on its sweetness with carrot. All thumbnail images by Felicity Cloake.Many recipes start with a classic sweated onion base, with Saveur magazine also adding shallot, while Wisconsin-native “photographer, author, stylist and farmer” (as she’s described inthe Blasta Soup book)Imen McDonnelladds leek to the mix. Both of these contribute a pleasant sweetness that works well with the beer, but shallot always feels to me as if it has more of an affinity with wine-based dishes, while leek is a time-honoured pairing with cheese. Double down on that sweetness with the carrots used byMinnesota’s Amy Thielenand America’s Test Kitchen, which my testers and I prefer to the former’s red pepper (“Nice, but gives it more of a Tex-Mex vibe” – never mind that Thielen’s recipe comes from Minneapolis chef Steven Brown).McDonnell also adds garlic and rosemary, and starts her soup off with bacon, scooping it from the pan to use as a garnish, and frying the vegetables in its fat. This is an excellent idea, not least for ramping up the savoury flavours, and also feels very American (if in doubt, add bacon), though butter or oil will also work if you’d prefer to keep things meat-free. (No doubt this could also be made with plant-based cheeses, which have come on leaps and bounds in recent years, but I haven’t tried it myself.)The liquidView image in fullscreenAmy Thielen’s beer cheese soup favours ‘a mildly flavoured blonde or pale ale’.A soup made from beer alone is likely to be unpleasantly bitter, so it’s usual to cut it with stock (a neutral chicken is the most popular choice, but you could use Saveur’s vegetable variety, or the beef stock called for byLizzie Kamenetzky in Winter Cabin Cooking, as included inHenrietta Clancy’s book Just Soup) and some sort of dairy. Thielen goes for half-and-half (a slightly thinner US single cream equivalent), and Kamenetzky and McDonnell with a finishing dash of double cream. Given the richness of the cheese, however, I’m inclined to agree with America’s Test Kitchen that“milk work[s] better than the usual cream and half-and-half, which are both heavy, even when cut with chicken broth”.Beerwise, Bianca Valencia, Dee Laffan and Mei Chin, compilers of the Blasta BooksSoupcollection, write that McDonnell’s “ideal beer for this soup is Wisconsin’s Pabst Blue Ribbon, but it’s not easily available here in Ireland. We suggest substituting it with a lager or pilsner.” Thielen, meanwhile, favours “a mildly flavoured blonde or pale ale”, Kamenetzky lager or golden beer, and Saveur “ale”. My testers have a strong preference for mellower, American-style lagers here, as opposed to richer, hoppier blondes and pale ales, which can become bitter and cloying when heated.That said, one should be able to taste the beer; it’s not here just for show, which is why McDonnell’s recipe is so clever. She adds half early on in the process, reducing it to concentrate the flavour, and the remainder near the end of the cooking time, so its freshness does’t get lost. (Teetotallers: alcohol-free lager ought to work just as well.)The thickenerAll the recipes use a roux, with the exception of Kamenetzky’s, which comes from the Swiss Valais region rather than the US, because the idea of bread as thickener intrigued me. She uses a rye loaf, which, when soaked in blonde beer, makes for a very strongly flavoured dish – if I made it again, I wouldn’t bother to puree it, because my testers struggled with the thick, porridge-like consistency; cubes of softened bread in a beery broth would be more akin to similar dishes I’ve eaten in the Italian Alps.Most recipes suggest whizzing the soup until smooth, but, given the richness of the ingredients, my testers and I decide we prefer the chunkiness of McDonnell’s version, which feels less like drinking a fondue (she also stirs in steamed broccoli towards the end, which works wonderfully with the cheese; that said, it turns this into a slightly different dish, so I’ve left it out). Feel free to get your stick blender out if you’d prefer a silkier result, though I’m not sure elegance is what this dish aspires to.The cheeseView image in fullscreenLizzie Kamenetzky’s beer cheese soup uses raclette.Cheddar is the most common choice – but beware! As America’s Test Kitchen explains, “low-moisture cheeses like flavourful aged cheddar are likely to break when melted – resulting in a grainy, greasy soup”. Their solution is to add American cheese, which “contains emulsifiers to promote melting”, but I find that as long as you stick to medium rather than mature varieties (which would, to my mind, be far too strong to consume in such quantity, anyway), add it slowly and don’t let the soup boil, there should be no issue with splitting, and thus no need for processed cheese or the cornflour ATK sprinkle in “to prevent clumping”.As long as you steer clear of anything too hard and dry, you can play around with the mixture as you see fit: Kamenetzky uses raclette, McDonnell a little smoked cheddar, while Saveur crumbles gorgonzola on top to serve (personally, the last feels like a cheese too many, but perhaps I’m being too British).The seasoningsView image in fullscreenSaveur’s beer cheese soup is seasoned with caraway seeds.The Saveur magazine editors’book of Soups and Stews(from 2015, when they still published both a print magazine and books) seasons the soup with caraway seeds, which feels like a nod to Bavarianobatzda, and works brilliantly with the beer – I’ve also added a pinch of sweet paprika for both its colour and gentle warmth, and McDonnell’s mustard powder for the same reason. If you’re not keen on caraway, we also very much enjoyed the thyme used by many recipes.Fans of Welsh rarebit should take a look at Thielen’s recipe in her book The New Midwestern Table, which I picked up on a visit to Chicago many years ago when I realised how little I knew about the cuisine of this vast swathe of the States. Seasoned with nutmeg, dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce, it feels a lot like toast in a bowl, topped with a jaunty dash of peppery mustard oil.Serving suggestionsView image in fullscreenImen McDonnell serves her beer cheese soup in a hollowed-out bread roll.“The best way to showcase this American beauty? In a bread bowl, of course,” McDonnell writes. Individual crusty rolls mean you don’t have to all hunch around one large boule clashing spoons and resolving finally to book that flu jab. Chives are my garnish of choice with cheese. You could make this ahead of time up to the point when you add the milk, and then very gently reheat it before adding the cheese, though you might need a splash of extra stock or milk to loosen it.Perfect beer cheese soupView image in fullscreenFelicity Cloake’s perfect beer cheese soup.Prep10 minCook30 minServes42 tbsp butter, or oil100g bacon lardons(optional)1 medium onion, peeled and finely chopped1 medium carrot, trimmed and finely diced1 medium leek, trimmed and very finely sliced1 tsp caraway seeds, lightly crushed½ tsp sweet paprika230ml American-style lager400ml chicken or vegetable stock1 tbsp flour1 tbsp mustard powder175ml milk200g medium cheddar, grated4 crusty bread rolls, insides hollowed out and saved for breadcrumbs (optional)Chopped chives, to serveMelt half the fat in a medium saucepan, then fry the bacon, if using, on a medium heat until golden and crisp.

But they’ve already been usurped by a spot in a repurposed office block less than half a mile away.The fabulously bizarreLilibet’sopened her doors with little or no fanfare in mid-September, beckoning us into her world of strange. Behold the antique fireplaces, the floral chairs and wallpaper, the multitude of gilt-framed, 18th-century French paintings, the pretty etched glassware, the monogrammed napkins, the tall dinner candles. Lilibet’s has about it the air of how the palace of Versailles would look if its designers (in Lilibet’s caseRussell Sage Studio) had been allowed really to let their hair down. The restaurant, by Ross Shonhan, ex-Nobuexecutive chefand founder of theBone Daddiesramen chain, is named after our beloved Queen Elizabeth II, God rest her mortal soul. Apparently, our former monarch was born in this very building on 21 April 1926, when the site was still a Mayfair townhouse.View image in fullscreen‘Really very,verygood’: Lilibet’s ricotta agnolotti with lemon and sage.And what better way to pay tribute to Her Maj than by creating from scratch a multimillion-pound, turbo-chintz, mock-aristocratic dining room serving fire-roasted beef-fat oysters, deluxe seafood platters, anchovy eclairs,trou Normandand a rather regal-sounding fish triptych. “What is a fish triptych?” I hear you cry. Well, this is when the diner selects a fish – gurnard, sea bass or sea bream – and it is then served in three ways: crudo, grilled and as a soup madeà la minutefrom its bones. Is there anything more “trapped at Balmoral for the summer when you’d rather be in the Bahamas” than a fish triptych? Did a fish triptych finally send the Sussexes fleeing to LA? I’m being churlish, of course, because a fish triptych is a fantastically eco-friendly way to eat all the parts of a fish, and is not just –cough– “leftovers”.Still, from the moment you enter, Lilibet’s throws up many questions. You, the bedazzled diner, will sit on your multi-cushioned boudoir chair in this charming, Las Vegas-style royalist fever dream, head spinning and muttering, “But how does it feel and smell so convincingly ancient when it’s been here for only a matter of weeks?” Where the hell do you buy a room fragrance called “Old Forgotten Chamber in the West Wing of Buckingham Palace circa 1976”? In many ways, Lilibet’s is the world’s sexiest purpose-built National Trust building, because, inarguably, all bank holiday Monday visits to a doily-festooned pile would be improved by having a bit less “here’s a moth-eaten tapestry” and a lot more “here’s a twinkly, pink velour-seated cocktail bar – would you like a plate of Cornish crab tarts and a lemon verbena martini?”View image in fullscreen‘The meal I’ll keep returning for’: Lilibet’s dover sole with Café de Paris butter.Obviously, all of the above would be extra-hilarious if the food was dire and the atmosphere stiff, but neither of those is true. Lilibet’s is, rather, pure joy. It’s high drama, camp as heck and utterly uncopyable. This is the place to take your out-of-town parents, your lover who feels neglected, and clients you really don’t want to talk to, because they’ll certainly be distracted by the decor as well as by the plates of fritto misto, warm pittas with spiced tomato salsa, chrysanthemum salad with Caesar dressing and, one of the best things I tasted here, the freshly made ricotta agnolotti with sage and lemon sauce, which is really very,verygood.The meal I’ll keep returning for, though, will be the dover sole, expertly filleted tableside and served with Café de Paris butter, with a side of Lilibet’s mash, which of course comes topped with shellfish bisque and lobster meat, and perhaps with the sprouting broccoli topped withcolaturavinaigrette, chilli and mint alongside. And if you’re not struck with fish, I’ve also heard great things about Lilibet’s veal holstein escalope and its bone-in ribeye.View image in fullscreen‘Like something out of a Tom and Jerry cartoon’: Lilibet’schoux à la crème.Photograph: Beca B Jones/The GuardianThe dessert menu, too, will raise an eyebrow, not least because it features a steak sandwichprego, for some reason that remains unclear to me, because I was too busy debating having the crepe suzette, the princess sponge cake with raspberries and almonds, or the pile ofchoux à la crèmethat turns up on a glass stand looking like something out of a Tom and Jerry cartoon, only to be covered in an entire jugful of hot chocolate sauce.Lilibet’s is endlessly lovable. In fact, I’d go so far as to say it’s my new favourite restaurant. I’m not sure I entirely buy into all the various elements of its royal backstory, but it’s nevertheless a lovely dance through regal Wibbly Wobbly World. It serves mash topped with lobster, too, so I’m more than happy to eat and drink in the fairytale.Lilibet’s17 Bruton Street, London W1, 020-3828 8388.
