Brace yourself for the Mount Rushmore of rubbish!Stuart HeritageWed 5 Nov 2025 11.03 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 11.50 ESTShareLucy Mangan’sGuardian reviewof Kim Kardashian’s new Disney+ legal drama All’s Fair was something of a rarity. Not necessarily because she didn’t care for it – the scorn has been universal – but because she gave it zero stars.All’s Fair review – Kim Kardashian’s divorce drama is fascinatingly, existentially terribleRead moreNot two, the score you give something you want to write off as too mediocre to break sweat over. Not one, which is what you give something if you want to make the people who made it wince. Zero stars. All’s Fair, according to this newspaper, is a product entirely devoid of discernible worth. In the entire 204-year-old history of this publication, only 15 zero-star reviews have ever been written, and All’s Fair is so unremittingly awful it got one of them. These are the other 14, presented here as the Guardian’s Mount Rushmore of crap.Boat Trip, film review, 2002A notorious Cuba Gooding Jr comedy, and the first zero-star recipient in the history of this newspaper.What we saidPeter Bradshaw wrote: “Even the direst of recent teen-smut films have had a puppyish energy and an eagerness to please. But this? With its dated, clueless, unintentionally offensive gags about Swedish bimbos, like something from The Producers, only minus the laughs, it’s just living death.”Was it justified?Five years previously, Cuba Gooding Jr won an Oscar for his role in Jerry Maguire. Boat Trip was nominated for two Razzie awards and is widely thought to have negatively impacted his career.Fame Academy Live, concert review, 2003View image in fullscreenCould do better … the 2002 Fame Academy contestants.Photograph: Tim Whitby/PAThe seal well and truly broken, it took only six months for another review to reach the same giddy depths – this time for a live concert spin-off of a BBC talent show.What we saidAlexis Petridis wrote: “This concert could be no more efficient in parting parents from their cash if the Fame Academy students leapt from the stage and started snatching wallets at knifepoint.”Was it justified?Fame Academy limped on for a second series after this, before being axed.The Vines, concert review, 2003Just a week after the Fame Academy concert we gave a third zero-star review, as a then red-hot Australian rock band took to the stage of the Astoria in London.What we saidDavid Peschek wrote: “[Singer Craig] Nicholls is cast as the tortured lightning rod for a generation’s pain, so he sprawls on the floor and screams into the mic almost constantly. But this is not pain, it is a simulacrum of pain offering neither visceral thrills, insight, poetry nor catharsis. It is like watching a tantrum.”Was it justified?The band have released a further six albums since their 2002 debut, none of which captured the public imagination like they did in their early-00s heyday.Big and Rich, Horse of a Different Color, album review, 2004A country album by a duo comprising singer Big Kenny and the bassist from Lonestar, featuring songs such as Kick My Ass and Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy). The only album ever given zero stars by the Guardian.What we saidDavid Peschek (again) wrote: “Like the Bush twins at the MTV awards, this is arch-conservatism in a half-hearted search for cool. Big? Almost certainly and hence, quite probably, rich too. Not, by any means, clever.”Was it justified?Big and Rich won a Billboard Music award in the same year as this review; they have since been nominated for three Grammys and 17 Academy of Country Music awards.Martin Creed, concert review, 2004View image in fullscreen‘An experiment in charmlessness’ … Turner prize-winning artist Martin Creed turns his hand to music.Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The GuardianA gig by the British artist who had won the Turner prize three years previously.What we saidAlexis Petridis (again) wrote: “This show is provocative only in that it seems less like a gig than an experiment to see how charmless and pleased with himself a man can appear before the audience storm the stage and physically attack him.”Was it justified?In 2017, Lyn Gardner reviewedanother of Creed’s concertsfor the Guardian. She awarded it four stars and called it “endearing, exposing, ticklish and so totally unassuming that it’s hard to resist”.Oscar Wilde, theatre review, 2004One week later, equalling the record set the year previously, came a zero-star review of a play written by former Radio 1 DJ Mike Read.What we saidElisabeth Mahoney wrote: “The radio microphones, especially that of Peter Blake playing Oscar, are giving out only horribly patchy sound. We hear cast members speaking off stage. We endure duets where one singer is at full volume, while the other has no amplification at all. As this grim evening continues, you begin to wonder whether the sound system is being affected by the hefty rumbling of Oscar Wilde turning in his grave.”Was it justified?Oscar Wilde closed after this, its debut performance. That makes it far less successful than Cliff, Read’s 2003 musical about Cliff Richard, which ran for three full months.X Factor Live, concert review, 2005The following year, the Guardian reviewed a live version of the first series of ITV talent showThe X Factor.What we saidHelen Pidd wrote: “There are few experiences in cultural life that can shake one’s faith in the basic good of humanity, but sitting among 10,000 free-willed citizens who have paid £23.50 to watch blood-draining, pulse-stopping karaoke just about does it.”Was it justified?The X Factor’s television audience would increase to a peak of 19.4 million viewers by 2010, before contracting until it was axed in 2018.Peter Pan el Musical, theatre review, 2008After a three-year zero-star absence, along came a Spanish-language retelling of JM Barrie’s beloved book, presented with English subtitles.What we saidLyn Gardner wrote: “The show’s publicity proudly announces that one million Spaniards have seen this show, which just goes to prove that there is no accounting for statistics.”Was it justified?The musical ran in the UK for 36 performances. None of the British reviews were particularly kind.It Had to Be You, theatre review, 2010After a two-year gap came a revival of Renée Taylor and Joe Bologna’s 1981 romantic comedy.What we saidLyn Gardner (again) wrote: “‘I have no talent,’ cries Vito as he considers giving up his career and becoming a full-time writer. It’s clearly not going to stop him or the deluded Theda, and it clearly didn’t stop the writers of this painfully contrived piece of wish-fulfilment.”Was it justified?The play is still being performed around the world today, although reviews tend to be mixed.Valkee 2, technology review, 2014Four years later, a first: the only zero-star technology review doled out by the Guardian, for a device that claimed to cure seasonal affective disorder by shining light into your ear canals.What we saidSamuel Gibbs wrote: “None of the peer-reviewed studies listed in Valkee’s ‘science summary’ appears to be conducted without a conflict of interest with the company that produces the light headsets, having at least one of Valkee’s founders on each of the research teams.”Was it justified?Valkee filed for bankruptcy in 2021.The Greasy Strangler, film review, 2016‘Crams in every deviant activity you couldn’t begin to imagine …’Almost a decade and a half after Peter Bradshaw awarded a film zero stars, a second contender enters: an American comedy horror directed by Jim Hosking.What we saidWendy Ide wrote for the Observer: “This aggressively inane horror comedy manages to cram in every disgusting, deviant activity you couldn’t begin to imagine. And yet, it’s still rather boring.”Was it justified?Jordan Hoffmanalso reviewedThe Greasy Strangler in this newspaper, and described it as a “relentless monstrosity of a film … rife with fetishised cellulite, disgusting food and firehose penises.” He awarded it four stars.Love Island, TV review, 2021The seventh season of ITV’sjuggernaut reality show, and the second to be broadcast following the death of its original host, Caroline Flack.What we saidLucy Mangan wrote: “I hate myself as much as I love Faye, Kaz and Hugo and love it as much as I hate the rest and the whole retrograde stink of it.”Was it justified?Love Islandis still being broadcast, although it attracts half the audience it did in 2021.Sex: Unzipped, TV review, 2021View image in fullscreenAgonising … Sex: Unzipped.Photograph: NetflixNetflix’s “celebration of sexual health and positivity”, hosted by rapper Saweetie and featuring Romesh Ranganathan, Katherine Ryan and some puppets.What we saidLucy Mangan (again) wrote: “Saweetie is, especially for someone used to performing … uncomfortable, self-conscious and with a relentlessly flat delivery – it’s quite agonising. Perhaps she would be better off without the sex-positive puppets?”Was it justified?Sex: Unzipped has a 60% Rotten Tomatoes rating. It has not been renewed.Buying London, TV review, 2024A UK-based spin-off of Netflix’sSelling Sunset, following a band of high-end British estate agents.What we saidRebecca Nicholson wrote: “I hate that it makes Richard Curtis’s film Notting Hill look like a gritty documentary about the mean streets of London. I hate its England-for-dummies shtick that is clearly pitched at an international market. I hate its reverence for billionaires and bad taste, its celebrity name-dropping without actual celebrities, even the lurching drone footage that seems to have been shot by the Red Arrows.”Was it justified?Buying London has a 14% Rotten Tomatoes rating. It has not been renewed.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionDramaNewspapersKim KardashianLove IslandThe X FactorMartin CreedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

From hair-raising rugby antics to breakout star of Celebrity TraitorsViewers have been won over by the quick-witted and quirky former England international. But do they all know about the groin-grabbing and that ‘horse’ of his?Guardian sportWed 5 Nov 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 15.43 ESTShareIt’s difficult to know where to begin with a not-so-quick guide toCelebrity Traitors’ breakout star, Joe Marler. The BBC series has introduced a wider public to the tattooed, 18-stone-plus former England rugby union player – fans won over by his quick-witted humour, allied to a direct, confrontational form of questioning and an uncanny knack for detective work.Not all viewers, though, will beau faitwith his backstory; the 35-year-old dungaree-wearing ex-prop forward admitted he was mistaken for a sound technician by his fellow celebrities when first on set, and then asked whether he played rugby league when he revealed his previous 15-year career. For those who know rugby union, however, Marler’s style on the show has come as little surprise, save it being slightly toned down for a wider public audience.The backgroundMarler, from Heathfield in East Sussex, started out playing for Haywards Heath, captained England at under-18 level and went on to a career with Harlequins on the outskirts of south-west London, a stone’s throw from Twickenham. His shtick was the loud front-rower with a slightly edgy undertone, a dollop of eccentricity and a penchant for winding people up; including his own teammates.Over the years there were two domestic Premiership titles with Quins and 95 caps for England with whom he reached aRugby World Cup final in 2019. A landscape gardener before his rugby career took off – which might explain experiments with a different set of clippers on his hairstyles – Marler is married to Daisy, and they live in Sussex with their four children.The hot waterAt times Marler has seemingly been unable to help himself with on-field chat and eyebrow-raising antics. In 2020 he was found guilty of “grabbing, twisting or squeezing” Alun Wyn Jones’s genitalsduring an England v Wales Six Nations match and banned for 10 weeks. The brush with Jones was not the first time he had got into disciplinary trouble against Wales. In 2016 he wasbanned for two matches and fined £20,000for calling Samson Lee “Gyspy Boy”. Warren Gatland, the Wales head coach, apologised after initially playing down Marler’s comment as “just banter” and then released a statement saying: “I don’t condone racism of any kind.”View image in fullscreenJoe Marler lands himself in hot water after grabbing Welsh rival Alun Wyn Jones’s groin.Photograph: Michael Mayhew/Sportsphoto/AllstarEven the week Marler ultimately retired from England duty was framed around a throwaway comment on social media when he suggested the New Zealanders’ pre-match ritual,the haka, should be consigned to the bin. The remarks fired up the All Blacks, who duly dispatched England, with Marler having not even played. The social media post was his parting shot after leaving camp for personal reasons having decided he could not continue in international rugby.The humourWhen he wasn’t getting himself into trouble, Marler’s turn of phrase and quirky humour has lit up the sport. Discussing his post-retirement career earlier this year, Marler referred to his taking up of padel and new exercise as a necessity, describing himself as looking like “a melted wheelie bin”. When asked about his rooming preferences on tour, he referred to fellow prop Mako Vunipola as “Snorlax” and Tom Curry’s weird sleep-walking habits.There was an OnlyFans account dedicated to pictures of his feet, while after a heavy Champions Cup defeat for Harlequins by Clermont Auvergne in 2019, the front-rower’s surreal reflections on a 53-21 thrashingwent viral. “We’ve got another week to get back on the horse,” Marler said, warming to his theme with a horse “impression”. “I’m sorry about the performance last week … but I’m going to give a better performance at home against Bath,” addedMarler’s imaginary, “slightly Irish” equine. A podcast that originally began as The Joe Marler Show morphed into the more comedic Joe Marler’s Things People Do, focusing on quirky careers.The hairHats and flat caps have been a thirtysomething addition: for the younger Marler, hair was the way he said he tried to forge his identity in a well-heeled sport that sometimes felt alien to him. Think multi-coloured mohawks as loud as his personality or carving Jolly Hog Sausage into the side of his shaven head to promote Quins teammate Olly Kohn’s nascent business. The irony of the company’s “a proper porker” slogan was not lost sitting atop the mountainous prop’s head.View image in fullscreenMarler, pictured here in 2024, described himself as looking like a ‘melted wheelie bin’ in retirement.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe teammateMuch has been made of rugby’s team ethos being the foundation of Marler’s success on the programme, although on retiring, the player himself suggested he hadn’t always been the best colleague, admitting: “I’d been horrible to a number of the teammates, so they weren’t going to make an effort … I felt like this bad smell in the corner that at any moment could say something.”Still, his scrum coach at Quins, the Wales legend Adam Jones, described him as “misunderstood”, saying he was a lovely bloke, protective of his friends, who just needed reminding every now and then to keep it all in check. Jones’s method was to play a video of Wales defeating England in the 2013 grand slam match in which Marler played. His career post-retirement has also seen him become performance director with Team England Rugby, a body responsible for the welfare of players, negotiating with the Rugby Football Union and clubs over playing time, rest and recovery, suggesting the esteem he is held in by former teammates.The successDespite sometimes being the centre of attention for the wrong reasons, Marler became indispensable to England: he was a technically brilliant loosehead prop with the ability to play on the other side of the scrum. He tried to retire at 28 only for then England coach Eddie Jones to tempt him back for another 34 caps, including an appearance off the bench in the 2019 World Cup final, when England lost to South Africa.In 2021 he withdrew from another Eddie Jones squad, but again returned to the international fray, before hanging up his boots once and for all in 2024. “The first teammate I told was Dan Cole,” Marler said of his final decision. “We were sharing a room at the England hotel. I hugged him, he hugged me. The conversation went a bit like this: ‘I love you, mate.’ ‘I love you too.’ ‘What’s up?’ ‘I’m done, mate.’ ‘I know you are’.”View image in fullscreenMarler poses for a portrait in the kitchen of his home in 2020.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe advocateInhis autobiographyLoose Head: Confessions of an (un)professional rugby player, and in subsequent interviews, Marler revealed some of his behaviour masked mental health issues. He opened up on his depression,telling Donald McRaehow he accepted help after smashing up his kitchen when his wife was upset he hadn’t done enough to avoid a squirrel in the road (he didn’t run it over). Medication, therapy and a change in direction followed. Now an ambassador for the charityCalm(Campaign against living miserably); there was a documentary, too, with Sky called Big Boys Don’t Cry, while his podcast also offered a space for men to speak about their mental health.After retiring he said he would undo some of the ways he treated teammates in the past, telling a recent podcast: “In that environment … you have to be that alpha, it’s the toxic masculinity often described as poisonous … I look back at that and go, fuck, the amount of people I’ve made uncomfortable – I don’t want to do that now, I don’t want to be like that now.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.In the US, theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineis at 988 or chat for support.

Is the platform safe for children – or an ‘X-rated paedophile hellscape’?Sarah MartinWed 5 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 19.35 ESTShareI am an eight-year-old girl, standing near-naked in a room full of strangers.As the room spins and zooms upon me and people glide around me, I clock my features.I don’t look eight. I look like a grey Barbie doll, complete with cleavage and bare feet locked uncomfortably in the high-heel position. I have a large block head that resembles a grey marshmallow.I’m in theworld of Roblox, where block-like avatars transform themselves to explore a universe comprising millions of user-generated games. The platform boasts more than 100 million active daily users. Almost half are children under 13 and, in Australia, a 2024 study found that children who used the site play for anaverage of 137 minutesa day.On Wednesday, the eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, saidRobloxwould not be captured by Australia’s new social media ban but warned it remained “on the line” as the ban was continually assessed.“We’re using other tools in our arsenal to keep these other platforms safer … just because a platform is exempted through the legislative rules doesn’t mean it’s safe.”Over the course of a week I log on to the platform as a child to experience first-hand the gaming app of choice for Australian children. In my short time there my avatar is cyberbullied, aggressively killed, sexually assaulted and shat on – all with parental control settings in place.My skinny grey self starts by visiting one of the most popular “experiences” for young girls, a game called Dress to Impress which has had more than 6bn visits since its November 2023 launch. At its peak, the game had more than a million concurrent users. Vogue has reported that adult fashion junkies have joined the game’s devoted child fanbase, while the game has been promoted as a “household brand in fashion and gaming”.Clumsily, while soundtracked by a smooth synth jazz track, I begin to explore. The gap between my thighs is almost as wide as my waist is narrow.OK. I’m starting to get it. I have to choose an outfit according to a theme as a clock counts down. Some areas – including the VIP Lounge – are off limits unless I spend real cash, known across Roblox as “Robux”, but otherwise I have a small department store of clothes and accessories to choose from.I hustle to assemble a “sci-fi” outfit, scrambling to find clothes and work out how to put them on.In DTI’s makeup room, I find a number of heavily made-up faces.Photograph: DTI/RobloxI spot a scanty two-piece number but am yet to find a face.Oh, a knife! Yes. I might need that.Cat ears? Why not.Still hunting for a face, I try the makeup room. Here a dozen or so heavily made-up faces are on offer, with looks ranging from RuPaul to Ziggy Stardust.I end up with a Bratz doll-like head on some kind of stripper Barbie body.Getting here was easy. On sign-up Roblox asked for a username (specifying it should not be my real name) and a date of birth. It asked me to tick a box confirming that “your parent/guardian permits you to create this account and agrees to our Terms of Use”. Sure.View image in fullscreenPlayers strut the catwalk and are rated on a scale of one to five stars.Photograph: DTI/RobloxThe point of the game I’m now in – known as DTI to its fans – is to dress and be judged by my fellow players.Once the five-minute countdown finishes, players strut the catwalk and are rated on a scale of one to five stars, with rivals able to chat or post commentary in the open chat box. Players can strike a variety of poses – some are free, while other “pose packs” cost Robux.I give everyone five stars, hoping to boost any flailing confidence among other users.Players discuss the appearance of others in the chat box that seems as often disparaging as it is encouraging. The game’s latest update lets them throw tomatoes at other contestants or surround them witha virtual pile of shit.View image in fullscreenMy avatar walks into the basement ‘meat room’ in Dress to Impress.Photograph: DTI/RobloxWhile promoted as a kids’ game and an outlet for creative fashionistas, a dive into the world of DTI reveals the game’s darker side.I discover a basement “meat room” – which looks as though you’ve walked into someone’s uterus – hiding a pair of stilettos and a locked door. Other secret rooms are part of the game’s “lore”, offering creepy suggestions that a woman has gone missing. A previous update included a dungeon with a woman locked in a cage.‘Pay to troll’ featuresDTI’s devoted fanbase is getting restless.Users are complaining of updates that force them to spend more Robux to remain competitive. The increasing monetisation of children’s games is a widespread criticism of the platform.Marcus Carter, a professor in human-computer interaction at the University of Sydney, likens the site’s in-game spending promotions to “child gambling”, pointing to countless casino games and “loot boxes” within games that are readily available to children.View image in fullscreenThe game Suffer is rated as suitable for children aged five and older.Photograph: Suffer/RobloxHe spent a fruitless three weeks trying to get a refund for a lootbox bought as a 12-year-old on the grounds that they are illegal to sell to children in Australia.He has also tracked the rising phenomenon of “pay to troll” features – such as the shit-throwing on DTI – which incentivise bullying and prompt players to pay real money to do so.“Roblox games are actually monetising that kind of desire to troll and mess with and negatively impact other players,” he says.What is Roblox? Everything you need to know about the online game platformRead moreRoblox is big business. It is a US$92bn listed company in the US, owned predominantly by institutional investors. The chief executive, David Baszucki, owns about 10% of the company’s stock.Successful game creators – many of them children –can make money. In 2024-25 the company’s developer exchange program paid out more than $1bn through a convoluted payment plan under which the company keeps at least 30% of transactions made on the site.Developers earn Robux and can cash out US dollars once they make a certain amount. Last year’s median payout figure was US$1,400.Carter says while the platform does allow children to learn how to code their dream game, Roblox is essentially exploiting child labour through play – termed “playbour”.“Roblox really celebrates these instances of teenagers becoming millionaires because their games blow up on Roblox but this is all child labour,” he says. “All of its income comes from the games that its users are making.”Roblox has rejected suggestions it relies on child labour, saying most of its developers are over the age of 18.View image in fullscreenA player sits on my face and thrusts his hips while I implore him to leave me alone.Photograph: Vibe Place/RobloxCarter says venture capital-backed firms are buying popular games, with teams of developers and data analysts working out how best to extract more money out of their child player base.This year a leading Roblox role-playing game, Brookhaven, was bought by the game developer Voldex with the backing of the venture capital firms Raine Partners and Shamrock Capital.Other big businesses are moving in. This month the toy brand Mattel announced it would be expanding its gaming business in collaboration with Roblox and Fortnite, launching a Monster High game with other of its brands, including Barbie and Hot Wheels, to follow. Last weekthe AFL also announcedit was launching an official Roblox game to connect with gen Z and gen alpha users.DTI’s popularity has brought it high-profile collaborations with Lady Gaga and Charli xcx. It has released a line of DTI dolls and is promoting a forthcoming Wicked: For Good release to coincide with the film’s US release next month.View image in fullscreenOne of Roblox’s countless casino-like games where children can play to win ‘Robux’ using real money.Photograph: Arcade Island/RobloxBut as the game has become more mainstream, complaints are growing about inappropriate content for children.Last month DTI removed a new pose called “serve it” – bending over from the hips – after a backlash. A Reddit post in response to that release was titled: “Someone needs to warn the parents.”Then there are users who dress in “fits” that look naked, despite the presence of young children on the game. Roblox says DTI is suitable for children aged five and over.View image in fullscreen‘Fresh meat’ on Prison Pump – ‘It isn’t long before four giant “hombres” beat the life out of me’.Photograph: Prison Pump/RobloxIn seeking to understand who is responsible for the game being played by millions of children worldwide, I stumble across yet another layer of complexity in the Roblox ecosystem.

All the information in the public domain suggests that DTI is largely owned, managed and moderated by teenagers.Information released by Roblox shows DTI was developed by a user known only as “Gigi”. Gigi, whose gender and nationality are not provided, claims to have been 16 when the game was released and started developing it at 14.The trouble with Roblox, the video game empire built on child labourRead moreLast year, responding to allegations of inappropriate interactions aired on social media,Gigiadmitted to making “a vile and disgusting” joke about rape and to making fatphobic jokes. They also admitted to hosting a NSFW (not safe for work, meaning “adult content”) server on the Discord messaging and social media platform while underage.“I want to be clear, no pictures of minors were ever shared,” Gigi says. “Yes, it was a NSFW server, which in hindsight is really gross and inappropriate, but at the time I was literally just a bored kid.”The immaturity of the game’s management team was evident this year when serious allegations were raised against one of DTI’s most senior employees.A 20-year-old administrator was accused of grooming a 16-year-old. This had happened outside the game on an unrelated server.In response to the allegations, the staff member released a statement saying they had become friends with someone who “while not legally under the age of consent, was still too young for me to have become friends with at the time”.“I made very inappropriate jokes and said very inappropriate things,” the administrator said, revealing that they had been experiencing depression, anxiety and severe body image dysmorphia at the time.The imbroglio prompted the game’s manager – an 18-year-old known as Umoyae Free Spirit – toannouncethat the employee had been dismissed.Pushing Buttons: With the safety of Roblox under scrutiny, how worried should parents be?Read moreShe said the game was “considering making the moderation team 18+”.While Roblox claims responsibility for managing its “community standards” on the site, including cases of abuse, the company has sought to exempt itself from laws relating to social media by arguing it is merely a platform hosting other people’s games.A Roblox spokesperson said the platform was “committed to leading in safety through rigorous policies that go above and beyond what other platforms do”.“We use AI to check for violative content before a game is published, we do not allow users to share images or videos in chat, and we use advanced text filters designed to stop kids from sharing personal information,” he said.Guardian Australia contacted the manager of Dress to Impress for comment but did not receive a response.‘Perfect place for paedophiles’Roblox has long facedaccusations of being an unsafe platform for childrenand being frequented by paedophiles. In late 2024 the investment investigator Hindenburg Research called it “an X-rated paedophile hellscape”.Since then, the company has been hit with multiple lawsuits in the US, outlining tragic circumstances in which minors were groomed online and abused.In August theattorney general of Louisiana allegedthat Roblox’s safety failings had created “the perfect place for paedophiles”.A lawsuit filed in California in July is seeking damages for an 11-year-old who was violently raped after she was groomed on the platform by a now-convicted paedophile. The case accuses Roblox and Discord of “systemic failures to protect society’s most vulnerable from unthinkable harm in pursuit of financial gain over child safety”.View image in fullscreenComing under fire in the game Suffer.Photograph: Suffer/RobloxIn another lawsuit, a mother of a 15-year-old who took his own life accused Roblox of “recklessly and deceptively operating their business in a way that led to the sexual exploitation and suicide” of her son.Roblox does not comment on pending litigation but after the Louisiana lawsuit was launchedit said​: “Every day, tens of millions of people around the world use Roblox to learn STEM skills, play, and imagine and have a safe experience on our platform. Any assertion that Roblox would intentionally put our users at risk of exploitation is simply untrue.”Does video game monetisation harm children – and what is Australia doing about it?Read moreAt the same time as the flurry of lawsuits, the platform controversially banned a user called Schlep after the Texas-based YouTuber, himself previously groomed on the site, worked with law enforcement to pose as a young gamer and out predators.Roblox issued him with a cease-and-desist order and removed him from the platform.In Australia the eSafety commissioner has been negotiating with the company on a range of new safety measures after raising concerns about “child grooming risks”. By the end of the year the companyhas committed to making accounts for under-16s private by defaultand introducing tools to prevent adults from contacting them without parental consent.A number of key features will be switched off by default for children in Australia, such as direct chat and “experience chat” within games, until the player has gone through age estimation. Parents will be able to disable chat for 13- to 15-year-olds.“While no system is ever perfect, we have made over 100 safety enhancements this year alone to help protect our users and give parents more tools to manage and monitor their child’s online experience,” the company spokesman said.But, as I continue my experiment logged on to the platform as a child, I come across many more experiences that are clearly inappropriate.In one game – a vibe hangout where I am logged in as a 13-year-old – it doesn’t take long for another avatar to sexually assault me. He sits on my face and repeatedly thrusts his hips while I implore him to leave me alone.A group of male avatars later call me an “ugly bacon dirty gross girl” in reference to the bacon-like hair on my rookie default avatar.In another popular role-playing game – Berry Avenue – someone follows me around and pretends to shit on my head and face, calling me a toilet.View image in fullscreenI can access bathroom simulator games, dungeons, casinos, horror games, escape rooms and countless role-playing games where I can send and receive messages from strangers.Photograph: Coin Pusher/RobloxAnother game my eight-year-old avatar can access with all parental controls in place is called Suffer. After entering and arming myself with an axe and an ice-hockey mask I am immediately machine-gunned down.A friend reports that her 10-year-old son is hooked on a game called Prison Pump. I’m called “fresh meat” on entry and taunted for being a weakling. I have to start pumping iron or pay for more muscle. It isn’t long before four giant “hombres” beat the life out of me.I can access bathroom simulator games, dungeons, casinos, horror games, escape rooms and countless role-playing games where I can send and receive messages from strangers.The number of inappropriate games I can access while logged on as a child appears endless.It’s for this reason Carter, who is keen to emphasise the positive benefits from gaming and digital play, says he doesn’t have a good answer when parents ask him how they can know their children are safe on Roblox.“My son is four and I do not intend to ever let him play Roblox,” he says. “My life is about video games; I am a professor of games at the University of Sydney, I love games, my son and I are going to be playing lots of games together – but not Roblox.”Do you know more?

Take the fight to the rightAditya ChakraborttyFor too long, the centre has been adopting the language of the right but deploying it with greater civility – to disastrous endsWed 5 Nov 2025 13.09 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 14.20 ESTShareZohran Mamdani was forged in the era of Donald Trump. He came to socialism through watching Bernie Sanders run for the US presidency in 2016, in the contest that ultimately gave us Trump I. Last November, a few days after the election of Trump II, he asked voters why they’d backedthat guy. The conversations prepared Mamdani in his battle for New York, and thefilm of themreveals so much about the politics of this era that it repays watching.Those of us schooled in the tactics of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair might roll our eyes at yet another “listening exercise”, starring a powerbroker and his retinue in some beautifully lit hall, but this is no such thing. Here stands an unknown on a street corner in the Bronx, waving a placard as doughtily as a Seventh-Day Adventist. Rather than read off a Rolodex of platitudes, this politician sees his public – some of whom look a little like him, yet whose faces and bodies are etched with the strains of the city. Never having spoken to power, even a lowly state assemblyman such as Mamdani, they talk of lives made smaller and shorter in an economy where the daily basics are too costly. Politics has failed them, so they consider politicians to be failures.Such frustrations propelled Trump into the White House. This week they made Mamdani mayor of the US’s largest city. Analysts have often put the two side by side, only to utter banalities about how they are both good on TikTok or – that giveaway from pundits striving to earn their keep – “populist”. Yet the comparison carries far higher stakes.Both New Yorkers, they embody opposite sides of the metropolis: Manhattan versus its suburbs ; towers versus the streets. They also represent alternative paths for the US. Trump leads his country towards ethnonationalism and Darwinian economics; Mamdani stands for immigrants and a city affordable for all. Crucially, he understands the urban working class is not just white, but often black and brown. It is only through an understanding of the grave dangers posed by Trump that you can glean the hopes vested in Mamdani.A few examples: in September, Trump’s guardsgrabbed Korean engineers, who had their papers in order, from a Hyundai factory to force them out of the country and thousands of miles away. Last month, ICE agentsabducted a British journalisttravelling the US on a valid visa for criticising the brutalities committed by Israel. Last week, only hours before 42 million low-income Americans lost theiraccess to food aid, the president hosted aGreat Gatsby-themed bash, featuring a scantily clad woman in a giant martini glass. The fete was titled: “A little party never killed nobody.”Such guffawing, lethal thuggishness is why other cities are so enlivened by a contest of otherwise glancing importance to their own lives. Even in a globalised social media, the question of who heads five boroughs on the eastern seaboard of the US does not usually command transnational significance. In the country, the centre of financial power is shifting from east coast to west, from Atlantic to Pacific, Wall Street to Silicon Valley. Nor does the new boy’s crowd appeal derive solely from his youth and charm, or even his recognition of theenduring greatnessof the Wu-Tang Clan – although none of those hurt.Still, the chief reason Mamdani has aroused such keen interest is because he is the first leftwinger to show that politicians can not only face down Trumpism, they can beat him. That is the defining task of our era, as New York’s new mayor knows. Amid the thank-yous oflast night’s victory speech, he declared: “If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him.”Over the past year of Trump II, the finest talents on the centre-left have been stumped how to respond. Obama? Almost nothing. Kamala Harris? Writing her memoirs, of course. The fiercest hostility to Mamdani has come from those supposed to be on his side. After losing in the primary,serial sex pestAndrew Cuomo ran as an independent – and campaigned as Trump’s pick in this week’s contest. The man who is today the first Muslim to lead New York has faced constant innuendo that he is a terrorist sympathiser.Across Europe, the prefects of social democracy have kowtowed to the US’s extremist-in-chief. Keir Starmer treated him to anunprecedented second state visit, while Nato chief Mark Rutte hascalled him“daddy”. Five years ago, US media moguls took the knee to show off their commitment to diversity; now they bend the knee to a racist loudmouth. Columnists and podcasters talk utter sausage about a “vibe shift” in US politics, even whiletwo days of mass ralliesagainst Trumpism drew something like 12 million people.The centre-left should be taking on the extreme right and acting as the anti-Trump. Instead, as Fintan O’Toole writes in the latest New York Review of Books, it isplaying at being not-Trump. Or: not-Farage, not-Weidel, not-Le Pen. In the UK, Starmer’s pitch is basically: we’ll adopt the language and the flags, but deploy them with greater civility. As a response to this moment, it is morally contemptible and politically myopic.In his fine new book The Great Global Transformation, the former World Bank economist Branko Milanovic describes how our political and economic order is now coming to an end. China and the global south now account for more of the world economy than the US, Japan, Europe and the many others put together that he terms the “capitalist core”; at the same time, capitalism is being redefined. The elites who prospered under the regimes shaped by Reagan and Thatcher are now redefining their nations into narrower, meaner, harsher societies, ditching the old commitments to multiculturalism and equality for women. They are forcing upon the rest of us capitalism without secure contracts, unions or even the HR department.Hold Milanovic’s lens over Trump and what do you see? Not an all-powerful emperor, nor some scheming bureaucrat like Putin – but the US’s Yeltsin. He is the buffoon presiding over his country’s decline in influence and importance, while behind him in the shadows the oligarchs carve up the spoils. And if democracy proves too troublesome, why, they’ll buy it. One of the biggest players in the New York elections was hedge-fund guy Bill Ackman, whooffered to bankrollanyone who could bring down Mamdani.In the 90s and 00s, the centre-left’s response to Reagan and Thatcher was Clinton, Blair and the third way. They compromised with the new money and triangulated their electoral bases – and they held power, for a while.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Climate chaos does not come with a moderate option. An oligarch is not interested in your pitiful attempts to strike a deal. To see the logical endpoint of the new left’s embrace of money, look no further than Peter Mandelson. Famous for being “intensely relaxed” about people getting filthy rich, he became especially relaxed in the company of the filthy rich, such as money man and child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein – and is now discovering anew the meaning of “disgraced”.The old foxholes and get-out clauses, abstractions and moist eyes, won’t work for the left now. Voters don’t talk about inequality; they worry about paying the bills and getting by. The young aren’t mollified by talk of “suffering” in Gaza; they want it stopped. And bang opposite, the right are bending politics and economics to their will.You can see the past year between Trump’s election and Mamdani’s as real-time dialectic. Thesis, antithesis; right hook, southpaw. It is foolish to pretend that there is any equivalence of power between the White House and Gracie Mansion, but at least the left is still in the fight.Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

ONE. JOB. Well, technically there might have been two, but we’ll come to that later. But one main job. And that’s to be able to count to six. That’s how many questions the leader of the opposition gets to ask at prime minister’s questions. It’s been that way since Tony Blair planted himself in Downing Street in 1997 and turned the spectacle from twice a week to one extended session. You wouldn’t have thought it was so hard to grasp. There again, some people find even the most basic maths challenging.Alas, poor James! You might not have heard of James Cartlidge. No shame there. Join 99.9% of the population. And if you had heard of him, you may not have known that he is the shadow defence secretary. No shame there either. Join 99.9% of Tory MPs. Put simply, James is instantly forgettable. Even to his own acquaintances. He has risen without trace. The best exponent of the Dunning-Kruger effect since Danny Kruger.And right now, Jimmy C will be more than pleased if all this stays that way. That he slips beneath every radar. Because right now he has locked himself inside a cupboard and is refusing to come out. Two shrinks have been brought in from the Priory to try to get him to come out quietly. “It’s OK,” they can be heard saying. “It’s safe now. Everyone has gone away. Who are you again?”With Keir Starmer away in Brazil at Cop30, Kemi Badenoch had used the opportunity to go to Aberdeen to make the case for fossil fuels – it’s almost as if she comes pre-programmed to be misguided on everything – so this week’sPMQswas left in the less than capable hands of the deputies. Or not the deputy, in Kemi’s case.Technically, the deputy leader of the Tories is Alex Burghart. Another name that self-destructs long before the end of any sentence in which it appears. Only, poor old Alex is not really trusted to do the one thing the job actually involves. He was once allowed out at the dispatch box but was so hopeless he has never been seen again. Since then, Mel Stride, Chris Philp and James Cleverly have all been given a runout. And all have been gratifyingly useless. Though no more so than Kemi usually is herself. But she is the only one who gets to repeat her incompetence.So this week it was the turn of Jimmy C to take the blue corner. Plucked from obscurity. Destined to return there within minutes. And in the red corner we hadDavid Lammy, also making his PMQs debut after the defenestration of Angela Rayner.Come the end of the session, David must have wanted to give Jimmy C a big hug. What might otherwise have been considered something of a disaster for Lammy passed off as relatively minor collateral damage. Almost as if Cartlidge was working undercover for theLabourparty.The kindest thing that could be said of Jimmy C was that he started badly and got worse. Twice he demanded Lammy apologise to the parents of the child abused by the later mistakenly released asylum seeker. Twice Lammy pointed out that he had already done so and would be happy to do so again. Cartlidge apparently couldn’t take yes for an answer.Jimmy C then turned his attention elsewhere. Did Lammy know if any other asylum seeker sex offenders had been mistakenly released from prison? A very specific question. One that alerted the whole house to the fact that Cartlidge thought he had an ace up his sleeve. That he had knowledge of just such a case. But Lammy just got a bit angry and blurted out that it was the Tories who had left the justice system in such a mess.This was all … weird. How come Lammy was the only person not to see the direction these questions were heading? That we were building up to some major gotcha. As justice secretary, he would surely have been told of any more prisoners who had been mistakenly released. Why not say there was an ongoing investigation? That for every month the Tories were in office there were 17 prisoners mistakenly released. One every two days. The system was in tatters. He was trying to mend it. Play for time. Instead, he just kept blustering. Perhaps he panicked. Couldn’t think quickly enough on his feet.Only, the gotcha never came. Because Jimmy C couldn’t count to six. Four times he demanded to know what Lammy knew, but he never got to reveal what he himself knew. He crumpled in embarrassment. Burghart tried to comfort him. Insincerely. He was just thrilled this all hadn’t happened to him. There but for the grace of God … Cartlidge affected outrage. The speaker had miscounted. He hadn’t. The buck stopped with Jimmy C.Cartlidge then tried to pass a message back to Tory MPs on the backbenches who were also down for questions. Ditch what you were going to ask and come to the rescue of the party. It looked like Rishi Sunak might oblige. Only Rishi clearly doesn’t much care for Jimmy C. Perhaps they have history. Instead, Rishi asked about prostate cancer. All that Cartlidge could do was make a point of order at the end. There had been another asylum seeker released. Only it turned out there hadn’t. The man in question wasn’t an asylum seeker. Cue tears on the Tory benches. On a day of fuck-ups, this was perhaps the biggest yet.This wasn’t the only ongoing drama. Lammy had made the schoolboy error of turning up without a poppy. This is politics 101. MPs make a point of competitive poppy wearing – I saw one MP with three in his lapel – and Lammy should have been aware of that. The rightwing media was outraged. HOW COULD HE HATE OUR VETERANS SO MUCH? Bridget Phillipson desperately tried to hunt down a poppy for David. It was Calvin Bailey, a genuine war veteran, who answered the call of duty. Fifteen minutes in and Lammy’s honour was saved. Though there were some who would never forgive him.It had all been an early pantomime. A farce in which the serious business of a failing prison system once again took second place. Even the Tories can’t be bothered to get their facts right. Though that didn’t stop Kemi repeating the error on X. Still, there were two winners. The real role of a deputy is to make the leaders look good. Jimmy C and David had done Kemi and Keir proud.Explore more on these topicsPMQsThe politics sketchLabourConservativesDavid LammyHouse of CommonscommentShareReuse this content"

So watch out if you’re rushing along on your phone or wheeling a small bag that could be carried ...Morwenna FerrierWed 5 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTShareIt’s a damp, grey morning in Soho, London, and Cameron Roh is standing a metre or so behind a woman who is speaking loudly into her phone outside Caffè Nero. She is breaking his “laws” of “pavement etiquette” and he holds up his phone and presses record. Lost in conversation, the woman doesn’t see him, but still, watching him from a distance, it’s fist-in-mouth awkward. What if she turns around? Is this allowed? Is this even OK?Suddenly, the woman hangs up and dashes across the road, oblivious to what has just happened. Evidence duly captured, Roh returns to where I am hiding and delivers his verdict, which is marks out of 10 – with 10 being perfect pavement etiquette. “That’s a two,” he says. Her crimes? “On her phone, sudden stop, pretty much in the centre of the pavement, meaning people have to walk around her to get past. No, no, no.” She didn’t see us, but that somehow feels worse; I feel as if we’ve just pickpocketed her. Roh giggles, unfazed. As a self-appointed pavement vigilante, this is what he does.The first video 21-year-old Roh posted was in July. In about 20 seconds, he follows five different walkers, quietly unpacking their gait to camera before rating them for speed, direction, footwork and phone use. He has since rated walkers in New York in more than 30 videos, and has recently diversified to other US cities. This is his first time in the specific chaos of central London. “So far, it seems comparable to New York,” he says. Just then, a Lime bike almost collides with us outside a cinema. “Come on!” he cries. “Those city bikes are a new thing. That’s an automatic zero, buddy.”No one screams at anyone for walking badly, but we all feel itRoh says he tries to make sure that nobody is identifiable in his videos and he has strict rules about people who are off limits for criticism. Young children, groups of children, the less able, elderly people – although how he determines whether someone is less able is unclear. At one point, we watch a small woman, who I would guess is in her early 60s, pushing a Brompton bike, navigating her way through a school group while on her phone. Roh watches her and decides against filming, even though she is breaking almost every one of his rules. “I focus on people who actively choose to be inconsiderate,” he says. And it’s not just because they bother other pavement users, he says. “They are also safety hazards.” The woman with the Brompton is “fast, and clearly has somewhere to be”.Rather than presume there is a right way to walk, Roh is proposing that everyone simply has the righttowalk. Yet whether it’s manspreading on buses or queue-jumping, frustration at poor public protocol is not only common, it’s a bedrock of British humour. That said, while holding strong opinions on how things ought to be done is a very British pastime, getting angry about it in public is not our style. “Rage only ever applies to traffic – it’s the same in New York,” says Roh. “The thing is, no one screams at anyone for walking badly, but we all feel it.”View image in fullscreen‘That’s an automatic zero, buddy’ ... Roh and Morwenna Ferrier in Soho.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianPavement etiquette is “getting worse,” he says, in part due to smartphones. He pauses to point out how many people around us are walking while staring at their phones. “I call these people neck breakers,” he says. “People stuck at a 45 degree angle on their phones, not with us in reality”.When judging walkers, the first thing Roh looks at is speed. “If you’re walking badly – so not in a straight line, or dragging something – but your pace is adequate, then you’re probably not affecting my journey,”he says. Then it’s placement. “If you’re zigzagging, aimlessly cutting people off, not paying attention to your surroundings, that’ll lose you a few points automatically.” Within these, there are some subcategories that will feel both new and familiar – Lime bikes mounting pavements, phone-gawping, scooters on pavements, chuggers, wheelie suitcases that are small enough to be carried, people who are too busy eating on the go to look where they are going. Then there are the head-on walkers who crash into you, he says, as we step aside to avoid one. “If you’re checking your maps, then just pull over,” he mutters to a group of women prodding a screen with their fingers.The world is so disconnected. We’re consumed by our phonesRoh has a glossary of misdemeanours that provides the framework for his system. The woman outside Caffè Nero committed the “brake check”, he says, which is when people come to a sudden halt. “Woompf! Hard stop. Right in front of you, no checking the blind spot.”A personal bugbear is people walking side by side: “double wides” or “triple wides”, and “linked double wides”, which is a couple attached to one another somehow “making it harder to, you know, get through”, he says. What’s the biggest phalanx he’s seen? “Sometimes you get a linked quadruple-wide, at which point …” With a heavy sigh, he shakes his head.Of course, Roh is not the first person to get in a flap about this stuff. It’s a genre if not invented then normalised by the comic writer Fran Lebowitz, whose cutting maxims about how people should behave in public have been the basis of books and world tours. Roh shrugs when I mention her name and makes a note to Google her later.View image in fullscreenA personal bugbear is people walking side by side …Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianWe walk round a group of men huddled in the middle of the pavement. They should “leave space for those of us who have somewhere to be”, he mutters. But it goes deeper than that – one of Roh’s biggest frustrations is that cities seem increasingly designed for vehicles rather than people. Pavements are narrow, and often badly paved compared with the roads beside them. Some pavements even slip into roads and back again, with little warning.Walkingin cities is a leveller, but it’s also discombobulating and even dangerous, turning a potentially civilised urban stroll into a hip-bumping, traffic-harried race to the finish. “These places aren’t for people, even though they are.” Really, though, it’s about getting from A to B at speed – or capitalism. As Colson Whitehead wrote in The Colossus of New York: “Everyone thinks they are more deserving, everyone thinks their day has been harder than everyone else’s, and everyone is correct.”As a member of gen Z, Roh has always “lived and breathed social media”. Born and educated in Ohio, he got a glimpse of his future at high school, when he had to deal with “hallway rage”. People in corridors, people loitering … “I’m gonna be late to my destination because of you? No way, that’s gotta stop,” he says. “I’ve always been a fast walker, always knowing where I’m going.”After moving to New York for its golden opportunities, he was shocked by the way people moved in this tight urban space, so he joined the throngs who have turned TikTok andInstagraminto a lucrative sport, and began to film them.View image in fullscreenBikes mounting the pavement is a no-no.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianGiven Roh’s reservations about smartphones, the irony that his entire body of work is filmed and parsed through a screen is not lost on him. “The world is so disconnected,” he says. “We’re just consumed by our phones and our AirPods. You think it’s just gen Z and gen Alpha, but it’s everyone now. Age is not even a defining factor. But doing what I do, it’s a way of getting out, an activity, so I’m walking with purpose.”So far, Roh’svideoshave accrued 10m views – and he has inspired copycats, something he puts down to this being about “a universal feeling”. His preferred time for vigilantism is first thing in the morning. “I give a little more grace later in the day,” he says, because people tend to be in less of a rush.The videos are fun and cranky, little acts of civil dissent playing out in real time. A man looms into view in front of us, dragging a suitcase alongside him while also looking at his phone. “He’s doing his best,” says Roh. “He’s fast, but he’s taking up space. Have you heard of manspreading? He’s sort of man-walking.”According to the Metropolitan police, you do not need a permit to film or photograph in public places, and the people Roh films are mostly unrecognisable and filmed from behind. Still, doesn’t he ever feel bad about what he’s doing? “Not really. The reaction I get is thank you. People think I’m cleaning up the cities.” Like Batman, then. “The thing is, we need more of this – we need more people doing this, and then people will walk better.”I put to Roh that surely there must be room for loafing. Where is the 19th-century flâneur – whose aimless stroll allowed for observation without participation,described by Edmund White as a “compromise between laziness and activity”– in all this? “The what? No. Like, just go to a park,” he says. The thing is, when you see people wandering aimlessly, slowly, blissfully, ignorantly “it kind of makes you jealous, doesn’t it?” he says.Later that day, as I’m rushing to pick up my children, my path is blocked by a carefree young couple pottering along. Hearing me puff away, the man reflexively steps aside – but too late, I’m on the road, darting around them. I make a mental note – linked double wide, one out of 10 for the acknowledgment. We’re all pavement vigilantes, really: we just don’t have Roh’s vocabulary.Explore more on these topicsWalkingSocial etiquetteSocial mediaCommutingTikTokInstagramfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Described as white, bald and clean-shaven, he was sentenced to 45 months for multiple fraud offences on Monday and freed in error the same day.The latest errors come just days after Hadush Kebatu, an Ethiopian national,was accidentally freed from Chelmsford prisondespite convictions for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman days after arriving in the UK in a small boat.Lammy had ordered five pages of new checks for prison governors after the release of Kebatu, who was supposed to have been removed to an immigration detention centre. He was arrested in northLondonand deported after being given a £500 discretionary payment.View image in fullscreenHMP Wandsworth, which accidentally freed two criminals.Photograph: Lucy North/PAThe Guardian understands that Kaddour-Cherif was in prison for trespass with intent to steal but was convicted in November 2024 of indecent exposure linked to an incident in March of the same year. He was sentenced to an 18-month community order.Cherif is understood to have entered the UK legally on a visitors’ visa in 2019 but overstayed. An “automatic probable overstayer” case was created by the Home Office in February 2020 and he is, sources say, in the initial stages of the deportation process. Questions will be raised as to why he was not removed from the UK five years ago, after overstaying his visa.The Met was informed of Kaddour-Cherif’s release shortly after 1pm on Tuesday, giving him a six-day head start. He has links to the Tower Hamlets area, but is also known to frequent the Westminster area.A Met spokesperson said: “Shortly after 13.00 on Tuesday 4 November, the Met was informed by the Prison Service that a prisoner had been released in error from HMP Wandsworth on Wednesday 29 October.”Surrey police, meanwhile, put out an appeal to find Smith. He had appeared in Croydon crown court via a live video link from HMP Wandsworth, before being released in error.The Prison Service is examining the possibility that officers did not have a warrant to hold the men in custody. There has been an increasing number of cases in which prisoners are being moved between jails and courts and warrants are being lost and misplaced in the process. This forces prison staff to allow prisoners to walk free.Downing Street said Kaddour-Cherif was “a concerning case”, with Keir Starmer’s official spokesperson adding: “It’s unacceptable, and the circumstances behind it will be forensically looked at … It’s clearly a developing situation, and it’s important to establish the facts.“One mistaken release is too many, as we saw in the Kebatu case. That is why we’ve ordered the review led by Lynne Owens. I think it’s fair to assume that this case will form part of that review.”The Labour MP Rosena Allin-Khan, whose constituency includes Wandsworth prison, said after hearing of Kaddour-Cherif’s release: “I’m horrified to learn that someone was mistakenly released from Wandsworth prison.“Local residents will quite rightly be deeply concerned. We urgently need answers from the government and Ministry of Justice as to how this was allowed to happen.”In tense Commons exchanges, the Tory frontbencher James Cartlidge, standing in for Kemi Badenoch at prime minster’s questions, clashed with Lammy, who was standing in for the prime minister, who is in Brazil for the Cop30 summit.Cartlidge asked repeatedly whether any asylum-seeking offenders had been accidentally let out of prison since Kebatu. He is understood to have been aware of at least one release when he asked his questions.He said: “He’s the justice secretary. He’s responsible for the justice system. He needs to take responsibility … Can he reassure the house that since Kebatu was released, no other asylum-seeking offender has been accidentally let out of prison?”Lammy said: “We know that there have been spikes since 2021 under his watch. When did he come to this house and apologise? Let me just remind him that he was a justice minister that allowed our prisons to get to this state in the first place and it’s now for us to fix the mess that we’ve got into.”In the year to March 2025, 262 prisoners were accidentally released, up from 115 the previous year. The Labour government has attacked the Tories repeatedly for leaving them a broken justice system.Reacting after PMQs, Lammy said he was “absolutely outraged”. He added: “The Metropolitan police is leading an urgent manhunt, and my officials have been working through the night to take him back to prison. Victims deserve better and the public deserve answers.“That is why I have already brought in the strongest checks ever to clamp down on such failures and ordered an independent investigation, led by Dame Lynne Owens, to uncover what went wrong and address the rise in accidental releases, which has persisted for too long.”Lammy said the latest incident exposed “deeper flaws” across the criminal justice system and that Owens’s review would leave “no stone unturned” to identify the problems so they could be fixed.The Conservatives called on Lammy to return to the Commons to make a statement. A spokesperson said: “If we knew, we can only assume the justice secretary knew.”In a statement late on Wednesday, a Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “The crisis in the prison system this government inherited is such that basic information about individual cases can take unacceptably long to reach ministers.“On entering the house, facts were still emerging about the case and the DPM [deputy prime minister] had not been accurately informed of key details including the offender’s immigration status.“No media story about the individual case was yet in the public domain and it was and remains subject to a live police investigation.“The DPM was asked questions about the release of an asylum seeker. As was confirmed after PMQs by the Home Office, the individual was not an asylum seeker.“The DPM waited until after PMQs and further facts had emerged before making a statement.”The Prison Officers’ Association (POA) called for an “entire overhaul” of the sentencing calculation and discharging process and warned Lammy not to seek to blame individual officers for systemic failures.Mark Fairhurst, the POA’s national chair, said: “This latest releasing error highlights the immense pressure placed on the system and the need for an entire overhaul of the sentencing calculation and discharge process.“Staff on the frontline should not become scapegoats when the leaders of the service have failed to address this problem for at least the last 12 months.”Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationMetropolitan policeLondonPoliceDavid LammynewsShareReuse this content"

They say that could be brought down to 1.5C by the end of the century by phasing out fossil fuels and usingcarbon removal technologiesto suck carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.This will not erase the danger of exceeding 1.5C, however. Scientists are aware of several key tipping points – such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, and the potential for the Amazon rainforest to turn from a carbon sink to a source of carbon release into the atmosphere – that could be triggered as Earth warms further.It is unclear at what temperatures these events could happen and every fraction of a degree of warming is a risk. One key tipping point, the bleaching of corals in warming seas,may already have been reached, according to a recent study.Bill Hare, the chief executive of Climate Analytics, said: “Overshoot of 1.5C is a woeful political failure and will bring increased damages and risk of tipping points that otherwise could have been avoided. But this roadmap shows that it is still within our power to bring warming back well below 1.5C by 2100.“We must do all we can to limit any time we spend above this safety threshold to minimise the risk of irreversible climate damages, and the devastation that would be caused by crossing tipping points.”At Cop30, all countries are expected to produce national climate plans under the 2015 Paris agreement. Called nationally determined contributions (NDCs), these are meant to set out targets on cutting carbon and measures to achieve them. But fewer than half of countries have submitted NDCs before Cop30, and many of those that have been produced are inadequate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

However, they have also seen a revolution in renewables and batteries, which have shattered records across the globe.

Further interest is now accumulating at an annual rate of 8%, the DHSC has said.The list of creditors in the administrators’ document also includes HMRC, stated to be owed £39m. Given the confidentiality observed by HMRC over individuals’ and companies’ tax affairs, this is the first time it has been made public that PPE Medpro faces a demand on this scale for unpaid tax.The administrators did not explain the nature of the unpaid tax, although it appears to be corporation tax due on PPE Medpro’s profits as the document also states that no money is owed for employees’ PAYE, national insurance contributions or VAT.The total debts of the company are put at £188m, comprising the £148m owed to the DHSC, the £39m in unpaid tax, £207,000 owed to Grosvenor Law, the company’s lawyers in the recent court battle with the DHSC, and £1m owed to the Isle of Man entity linked to Barrowman that put the company into administration.The administrators have not provided details about PPE Medpro’s government contracts or where its profits have gone, but the document states: “A review of the company’s bank statements reflects a small number of entities that have received the vast majority of funds from the company’s bank accounts.”The DHSC awarded the £122m gowns contract to PPE Medpro, and another worth £80m for face masks – a total of £203m – after Mone firstapproached Michael Gove, the then Cabinet Office minister, in May 2020.The contracts were processed via the “VIP lane” operated by Boris Johnson’s Conservative government during the pandemic, which gave high priority to people with political connections. Mone was appointed a Conservative member of the House of Lords by David Cameron in 2015.She and Barrowmandenied through their lawyersfor years that they were involved in PPE Medpro, in response to questions from the Guardian and evidence that they were involved. In November 2022, the Guardian revealed that Barrowman had beenpaid at least £65mfrom PPE Medpro’s profits, then transferred £29m to an offshore trust set up to benefit Mone and her three adult children.TheDHSC sued the companyin December 2022, following public and political outcry after the Guardian’s reporting. After a 12-day trial at the high court’s Rolls Building in the summer, Cockerill concluded that PPE Medpro had not complied with the legal and regulatory requirements to ensure that the gowns, made in China, were certified and validated to be sterile.In December 2023,Mone admittedin a BBC interview that the couple had lied to the media, and the couple confirmed their involvement in the company. Barrowman acknowledged he had been paid £60m and transferred money into the trust; the couple said his children were beneficiaries as well.After the companymissed a 15 October deadlineto repay the money, the health secretary, Wes Streeting, said: “We will pursue PPE Medpro with everything we’ve got to get these funds back where they belong – in our NHS.”But the government faces legal obstacles if it is toget any money back, as no funds were left in the company and it is in administration.The administrators’ statement makes clear that they do envisage being able to ultimately recover money, and may make legal claims against unnamed “third parties”.Explore more on these topicsMichelle MonenewsShareReuse this content"

During the military conflict with Argentina over the Falkland Islands he was a Sea King helicopter co-pilot, with one of his tasks being to act as a decoy for Argentina’s Exocet missiles.He returned from the conflict a “hero” and was famously greeted at the end the gangplank in Portsmouth by his mother, Elizabeth II, who handed him a red rose, which he put between his teeth. He was awarded the South Atlantic Medal, known as the Falklands Medal, with an additional rosette for his actions.View image in fullscreenThe then prince returns from the Falklands and is given a rose by his mother, the late Queen.Photograph: Dave Caulkin/APFalklands veterans have said it would be “morally indefensible” for a medal earned through active service to be taken away.Simon Weston, 64, who was severely burned when his troop transport RFA Sir Galahad was attacked during the conflict,told the Telegraph:“He has lost all other aspects of dignity, respect and honour he was ever once shown. But the one thing you cannot strip away from the man, no matter how vindictive, vicious or virtue-signalling you want to be is that moment in his life where he was dignified, honourable and courageous.”View image in fullscreenSimon Weston, a veteran of the Falklands conflict.Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/ShutterstockAnother senior defence source who served in the Falklandstold the newspaperthat to strip Mountbatten Windsor of his campaign medal would be an “extraordinary” move. “Instinctively, if one does something brave it seems extraordinary to then go and say someone hasn’t done something brave,” they said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Closing the care homes and day centres could save £4.16m, LCC said.LCC currently spends about £545m a year on adult social care.Last monthit began a consultationon moving residents out of five local authority care homes and into other premises, “enhancing resident experience, while delivering essential savings”.It said more older people in Lancashire should be cared for in their own homes. The consultation closes in mid-December and the cabinet will make a final decision on the closures in February.Margaret France, a Labour councillor in Chorley, said it looked like “selling off the family silver” and “opening the door to private providers”.One of the homes is Woodlands in Clayton-le-Moors in Accrington. The council says it would need to spend £1.39m to bring it up to scratch.Dorothy Devereux, 92, a former nurse, has lived in Woodlands for 12 years. She said she was devastated by the proposals and insisted she would not leave without a fight.“This is our home,” she said. “Where are we all going to go?” She said she doubted that housing her in the private sector would save the council any money, and said she could not “go home” to be cared for because she had sold her home to pay for her fees.She added: “I’m staying here till I’m either forcibly removed or in a box.”Phil Price, whose mother is in Grove House in Adlington, another of the homes earmarked for closure, said: “My mum is 93. If she finds out about this, it’ll kill her.”He said he was disgusted at what he fears is a conflict of interest involving Reform’s cabinet member for adult social care, Graham Dalton, who owns a private care company in Lancashire.“I’m a paid-up member of Reform and I’m disgusted with him,”said Price.He voted for Reform knowing they planned to cut “waste”. But he said: “If there are parents who have paid into the system all their lives, worked hard for this country, if they’re ‘waste’, then we might as well just give up.” He said he would quit Reform UK if the homes closed.When the care home closures were discussed at LCC’s health and adult social services scrutiny committee on Wednesday, Dalton, a nurse, insisted he was not conflicted.He told the committee he was a part owner of 1st for Care GB. The company, based in Lancaster, offers private care, including 24-hour complex care and respite care.But he said he had “no pecuniary or non-pecuniary interest” in the care home closures.He was challenged by councillors including Liz McInnes, a former Labour MP who now sits on Rossendale borough council.She said: “I’m fairly sure that on our council if someone was part-owner of a care service that would at least be counted as a non-pecuniary interest because they could potentially benefit from care homes closing.”On Wednesday evening the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, said on X: “If this is what happens when Reform runs a council, just imagine [Nigel] Farage running the country – care homes closed and vulnerable people abandoned. We cannot let Trump’s America become Farage’s Britain.”In August the Care Quality Commission rated Lancashire’s adult social services as “requires improvement”, finding long waiting times for services, staffing issues and “stark inequalities between the most and least deprived areas”.Explore more on these topicsReform UKLancashireSocial careEnglandLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

London and its mayor have been repeatedly raised by figures such as Trump’s former chief of staff Steve Bannon as the disastrous outcome that New Yorkers had to avoid.“In recent years, there’s been a growing chorus of commentators and politicians on both sides of the Atlantic attacking London and New York for their liberal values,” Khan told the Guardian. “They paint a picture of a lawless dystopia in an attempt to sow fear and division. But ask most Londoners or New Yorkers, and you’ll find that this narrative falls on deaf ears.“Many of the challenges our cities face are similar, but they are not identical. But we are united by something far more fundamental: our belief in the power of politics to change people’s lives for the better.”‘Time for a new era’: hope swells in New York as Zohran Mamdani makes historyRead moreHe later tweeted: “New Yorkers faced a clear choice – between hope and fear – and just like we’ve seen in London – hope won.”Khan, 55, the London-born son of Amanullah and Sehrun Khan,a bus driver and seamstress respectively, who arrived in Britain from Pakistan in 1968,achieved a historic third term as mayor on the Labour ticket in May last year.Mamdani, the son of a Ugandan academic, Mahmood Mamdani, a specialist in colonial and post-colonial history, and Mira Nair, the acclaimed film-maker, made his own history on Tuesday as a Democratpicking up nearly 200,000 more votes in New York than his nearest rival,the former state governor Andrew Cuomo.“It’s never been more crucial for our cities to challenge those who weaponise our diversity and instead stand firm in the belief that no matter who you are, or where your family is originally from, you can achieve anything,” said Khan. “In our cities, hope and unity will always triumph over fear and division.”There are obvious, albeit superficial, similarities between the two men.For all that Mamdami, 34, has been characterised as a diehard socialist, his policy platform bears a distinct resemblance to that of Khan, who would describe himself as of the “soft left” on the British political spectrum – a flavour of progressive politics that is less enamoured of the munificence of market forces than politicians such as Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, but more sceptical about handing over the running of the economy to the state than the likes of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.They have both proposed types of rent controls. Mamdani wants a $30 (£23) an hour minimum wage in the city, while Khan has long supported a voluntary London living wage, which at £14.80 ($19.30) per hour is more than £2 beyond the UK’s statutory minimum.Mamdani has proposed to impose a 2% levy on earnings above $1m year (affecting about 34,000 households), but that will involve negotiating with the New York state legislature and with Governor Kathy Hochul, who has saidshe opposesnew income taxes. Khan does not have the powers to raise taxes, but he has sought such cash-raising powers to fund major transport projects.Making their cities affordable has also been central to both men’s policy prospectus: Mamdani proposed free bus transit while Khan has frozen fares for years. Both men have been outspoken on Gaza, condemning Hamas’s October 7 attacks but describing Israel’s war as genocidal. Khan was ahead of his party leader, the prime minister, Keir Starmer, in calling for the UK to recognise a Palestinian state.The context, though, is quite different. Mamdaniterrifies and excites his party in equal measure, observers say. Unlike Khan, whose 2024 campaign mantra was a “London for everyone”, the New Yorker’s rhetoric draws up dividing lines, and is seen by some as making a bogey figure of the “billionaire”.Khan has been involved in Labour politics for over 30 years and is well-attuned to building electoral coalitions. Asked about warnings that the wealthy would leave New York if Mamdani won, he responded by inviting them to the UK.“If that is the case, come to London,” he said. “I am going to roll out a red carpet and welcome you.”Brett Bruen, a former US diplomat in the Obama administration, said that the major issue is that at 34 years of age, there is very little to go on when judging how Mamdani will actually govern.He said: “He’s certainly managed to stand out as a leader made for this moment, but that comes, obviously, with quite a lot of scrutiny. Some of it, I think, is warranted in questions about his résumé and whether or not he’s got like the requisite experience to lead this huge city.“It’s fair to say that he is on the outer extremities of the political spectrum, even in New York. And you know, we have seen, in the case of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and some others, that while they’ve done well in certain segments, they also become popular targets for Trump and the Republicans.“Those of us who are more in the centre of the party, face a problematic predicament. How do we talk about a party that can appeal to independents, that can even appeal to moderate Republicans, when some of our most vocal and visible voices are those that are out so far on the left?”If the two men differ in terms of experience, rhetoric and level of internal support within their respective parties, there are certainly parallels in the dog-whistle – and worse – politics that their candidatures provoked among their opponents.When Khan first stood for mayor in 2016, his Conservative rival Zac Goldsmith was accused of pursuing arguably the dirtiest campaign in British politics.Tamils, Hindus and Sikhs were sent letters warning that their jewellery was unsafe, because Khan planned to introduce a wealth tax.The Conservative then cabinet minister Michael Gove suggested that Khan would implement sharia law if elected.The campaign culminated in an article by Goldsmith in the Mail on Sunday accompanied by a photograph of a London bus blown up during the 7/7 terror attacks and a headline suggesting that a vote for Khan would put the city into the hands of a party that “thinks terrorists are its friends”.Trump, meanwhile, hasdescribed Khan as a “terrible, terrible mayor”, and falsely claimed that London was facing “sharia law”.Mamdani faced similar slurs. “God forbid, another 9/11, can you imagine Mamdani in the seat?” asked Cuomo at one stage to the conservative radio talkshow host Sid Rosenberg.“He’d be cheering,” Rosenberg replied. Cuomo, who had previously referred to Mamdani as “a terrorist sympathiser”, laughed, adding: “That’s another problem.”“Any Jewish person that votes forZohran Mamdani, a proven and self professed JEW HATER, is a stupid person!!!” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Tuesday.Michelle Lujan Grisham, the Democratic governor of New Mexico, said that what united Khan and Mamdani was that they offered a positive vision of the future.“I think that is incredibly attractive to voters,” she said. “They want new ideas. They want innovation. They want optimism. They don’t want somebody who’s dark and negative and angry.“Mamdani is the opposite of dark, angry, moody and he’s very optimistic. So I think that’s the future of the Democratic party, identifying this enthusiasm and optimism for the future.”Leah Kreitzman, who was Khan’s director of external and international affairs until 2021, said that there was a clear parallel between the two men that explained much of the vicious backlash they endured.‘Turn the volume up’: Mamdani invokes Trump in fiery speech laying out plan of actionRead more“The reason why [Sadiq] gets attacked, both by the far right and by Islamist extremists is that the very fact of him and his success means that they’re wrong,” she said.“He completely defies their ideology and worldview: that he can be a Londoner, a Brit, a Muslim, from immigrant parents, liberal in his politics, but religious in his beliefs. If that’s all true and it’s successful and popular, they’re wrong.“[Khan and Mamdani] are quite important people in that sense, because they’re living embodiments of the fact that you can be all of those things.”The two men, who have only spoken once after Mamdani won the Democrat ticket for the mayoral election, have clearly also recognised that there is electoral mileage in having a clear positive vision but also in being the anti-Trump candidate.Khan told the Guardian: “What do nativist populist leaders hate? They hate liberal democracies. They hate progressives. They hate multicultural society. And in London, we have all that, and it’s really successful. So you know, having a really successful liberal, progressive, multicultural city led by a mayor elected not once, not twice, three times who’s of Islamic faith and Pakistani origin must be a real sore to him, a running sore, but that’s his problem not mine.”On winning in New York, Mamdani, with typical swagger addressed the US president: “Donald Trump, since I know you‘re watching, I have four words for you – turn the volume up.”Explore more on these topicsSadiq KhanZohran MamdaniNew YorkLondonUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With sequin dresses, statement evening coats and tops with feather detail, it’s set for the festive party season.View image in fullscreenA 16Arlington dress at M&S.Photograph: M&S X 16ARLINGTONIt came on the same day H&M unveileda similar venture with Glenn Martens, the Belgian designer about to take over at Maison Margiela.The two launches capped an autumnal flurry of collaborations between independent brands and high street stores. Last month, John Lewis brought out collections withLabrumandRejina Pyo, while Debenhams did one with the “king of sequins” Ashish Gupta and M&S continued its Bella Freud collab with a range of eye-catching knits. It was also announced that the highly rated London designer Aaron Esh would be joining All Saints as its new creative director.Collabs have become an established part of high street fashion since the trend kicked off in the 1990s with Designers at Debenhams, which has drawn in names such as Jasper Conran, Matthew Williamson and Julien Macdonald over the year. H&M did their first in 2004, with Karl Lagerfeld, while Topshop made headlines in the noughtiesworking with Kate Mossand Christopher Kane.If those past hits gave the impression of high fashion sprinkling the stardust on the high street, the latest round suggests the tables have turned somewhat – offering a welcome outlet toindependent designers struggling financially.Esh, Pyo and 16Arlington have all skipped showing at London fashion week in recent seasons, because shows are so expensive.Speaking to The Business of Fashionwhen news of his All Saints appointment was announced, Esh was excited by the creative challenge but also praised the security his new job brings: “It helps me with the financials and foundations of my company and not having to live season to season.”John Lewis’s collaborations run across two seasons per designer – Labrum and Pyo follow A.W.A.K.E Mode, whose second collection landed in the spring. The department store chain’s director of fashion, Rachel Morgans, will not divulge the fee paid for these collaborations, but does say: “I hope they see it as a fair representation of the work that they’re doing, and the work that we’re doing together.”View image in fullscreenLABRUM for John Lewis.Photograph: LABRUM for John LewisEven if the price points are higher – £149 for Rejina Pyo shirt compared with £49 for a John Lewis one – the pieces are selling. Morgans says the green satin Pyo shirt sold out in a day, and the Labrum duffel coat is proving popular.Designers will benefit from a different demographic seeing their clothes, says Catherine Shuttleworth, a retail expert and the founder of Savvy Marketing. “You [the customer] might [see the collaboration] then look into that designer and buy one of the other pieces that are a lot more expensive,” she argues.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For small brands, to be picked up at M&S or John Lewis – all of a sudden Sally in Sunderland will know that brand.”Designers also see the inner workings of a much larger business, and this helps them develop as a result. Morgans gives the example of working with the Labrum designer Foday Dumbuya on knitwear. “We’ve been able to support on those categories that they haven’t really had as much experience in,” she says. “And obviously we would share our contacts with them as well.”Morgans has long worked in collaborations. She was part of the team that instigated them at Topshop 20-odd years ago. “It’s in my DNA, if you like,” she says. “I feel it’s really important as a British retailer we give something back … If we can be one step and support on that journey, I’m here for it.”Of course, there are advantages for the retailer, too. “What those brands bring to the high street giants is credibility,” says Lischke, “the attention to detail and fabric and fit and design ethos that exists in their luxury world … that’s the return basically.”Morgans says creativity is another essential factor. “Our design team get the exposure to brands and designers that expands their knowledge,” she says, pointing in particular to the collaboration with A.W.A.K.E Mode. “That means [they] can get braver and experience more and will push the boundaries more. I think that has an influence on the way we work going forward.”Explore more on these topicsRetail industryMarks & SpencerJohn LewisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She is only a couple of minutes late, but she is keen to explain. “I have such a problem, because I’m ayapperon the phone. I had two calls before this, and I’m like, I’ve gotta stop talking!” Luckily, it’s exactly what a writer wants to hear at the start of an interview. Besides, it’s fairly unsurprising. Anyone who has watched the unapologetically queer,unapologetically crass film Bottoms– which Sennott co-wrote with Emma Seligman, and starred in alongside her friend,The Bear’s breakout star Ayo Edebiri– will already know that she has plenty to say, be it about gender, sex, or the merits of starting a high-school fight club. And by the end of her new eight-part HBO series I Love LA, it is clear that she has even more to say about the darker side of Gen Z life (at 30, she is an honorary member of the gang, a tale-end millennial with a knack for straddling both generations).The comparisons toLena Dunham’s Girlsare inevitable and Sennott is, of course, a fan, citing the show alongsideSex and the City,InsecureandAtlantaas influences for her series, which follows the travails of an influencer, Tallulah (Odessa A’Zion) and her friend and fledgling talent manager, Maia (Sennott). Perhaps the largest spot on the moodboard, though, went to Entourage, the HBO sitcom about a rising A-list actor making his way in an often-seedy Hollywood (choice quote: “nobody’s happy in this town except for the losers”). Sennott started watching it during the pandemic, became “obsessed”, and decided to put her own twist on it “for the girls and the gays”.“I wanted to make a show where the internet, not Hollywood, was the industry, because my career started online,” she says. The idea for I Love LA came – in part – from her own, initially fractious, move to Tinseltown and from hersaturn return, a much-talked-about event for astrology heads. It was a period that saw her learn some big life lessons, professionally and personally. “In my early 20s I was so messy, crying in public everywhere, all the time,” she says. “In my mid-20s, I moved to LA and got settled. And then I felt like everything started to just fall apart. It was almost like these biblical tests …”Raised in Connecticut, Sennott began writing and performing comedy while studying acting at New York University (NYU) Tisch School of the Arts. “I went through all the proper channels to try to perform, and they weren’t gelling,” she says. “I tried out for all the NYU comedy groups, and got rejected from all of them. I tried out for all the NYU plays and didn’t make it into any of them. And I just felt like, what am I doing here?”View image in fullscreen‘Now I do love LA!’ … Sennott.Sennott took matters into her own hands, performing at open mics with Edebiri and posting hysterical (and decidedly weird) comedy videos online. One,Baby Cult, followed a group of women fetishistically obsessed with pregnancy;anotherimagined working at the preppy clothing store Hollister as akin to being trapped in a horror film. In a neat twist of fate, she met Seligman through the university’s film scene and ended up starring in herdirectorial debut, Shiva Baby, a tense comedy set at a Jewish wake with shades of Uncut Gems. The big theme of her career, she says, has been people her own age giving her a shot, rather than the industry at large. So, not the gatekeepers, then? “Notthe gatekeepers”, she repeats, adding with a laugh: “They don’t want us to win.”Anyone who had doubts about Sennott then will surely be kicking themselves now. In what she describes as a “wild, full-circle” turn of events, she seems to have manifested her dream vehicle.In 2019 she posted a video called “it’s LA” online,in which she lampooned Hollywood trailers (“I’m addicted to drugs – we all are”). Six years on, she’s the co-showrunner (with Emma Barrie) of a comedy about Angelenos balancing the perks of internet fame (such as partying at Elijah Wood’s house) with its pitfalls (your client being accused of being a drug-addled thief, and potentially becoming a “brand unsafe” pariah). It would be easy to make a show about online fame that was horribly aspirational – or, worse, one that punched down at its subjects. I Love LA does neither, making for a portrait of privileged twentysomething life that’s frank about the grot and the glamour.View image in fullscreenJordan Firstman as Charlie, True Whitaker as Alani, Odessa A’zion as Tallulah and Rachel Sennott as Maia in I Love LA.Photograph: HBO/Sky Comedy“There have been a lot of shows that depict young people and their relationship to the internet in this very condescending, hateful way,” she says. “I think that young people have been through a lot – I’m mostly thinking of people younger than me, like my little sister, who went to college during Covid, so she had to come home, or my other sister who was doing school online.” These days, she says, “it doesn’tfeel likethe world is falling apart – the worldisfalling apart. And you get to a point where it’s depressing, it makes you nihilistic.” The internet can be bad and good, she says, “but I just feel like it’s never really approached with nuance – it’s like, look at these vapid idiots on their phones. I wanted to approach it in a way where I didn’t judge the characters. Obviously they’re comedy characters, but I tried to look at all of them with empathy.”While it doesn’t offer full-on Marxist critique, I Love LA ponders the limits of the influencer economy, and the hidden costs of keeping up appearances. When we first meet Tallulah, she is living the high life – complete with an ill-gotten Balenciaga bag – but she is broke, her life online little more than social media smoke and mirrors. “Influencers are being sent a bunch of free merch, but maybe they can’t pay rent,” says Sennott. “I’m not saying they have the worst problems of anyone in the world. But part of what we wanted to show is that everyone is trying to present as doing better than they actually are, and pull back the curtain.”Varietypondered why we don’t actually see the content that Tallulah makes on screen, but Sennott didn’t think it was necessary. “No one wants to watch 30 minutes of someone editing a TikTok,” she says. Besides, “you see [Odessa] walk on camera and you go, yeah: that’s an It-girl! She just carries the charisma. I’m like, I don’t give a shit if she’s selling tinned fish or if she has a podcast!”View image in fullscreenRachel Sennott and Ayo Edebiri in Bottoms.Photograph: Courtesy of ORION Pictures Inc.As well as its on-the-ball observations, I Love LA is fabulously funny, often spit-out-your-coffee absurd, and has a lot of heart to boot. Picking out hilarious moments is tough – because there are so many – but the unmasking of an influencer as a “prison nepo baby” whose family used to own Rikers Island jail is high on the list, as is a meltdown that takes place to the sound of the much-memed All Star by Smash Mouth. In an episode inspired by a super-painful medical emergency that Sennott suffered in real life, Maia pretends to be Jewish to jump the queue at the hospital for “open-toe surgery”. Very Curb Your Enthusiasm, but also extremely Rachel Sennott, who has often been mistaken for being Jewish, perhaps fuelled by Shiva Baby (she is, in fact, from a Catholic family of Irish and Italian descent). Elsewhere, the friendship at the centre of the series is frequently toxic and codependent, but also steeped in the kind of picked-up-where-we-left-off warmth that only old friends can have. “I think you see the beauty of [Maia and Tallulah’s] relationship, too,” she says. “I hope it’s not just frenemies vibes!”The transition from film to TV was a learning curve, aided by the likes of Lorene Scafaria (Hustlers, Succession), who was an executive producer and directed two of the episodes. But it was a challenge that Sennott clearly rose to, along with the rest of the cast. “I could shout out every single person,” she beams. “There were no weak links. Everyone shines.” And, of course, she shines too, drawing on everything that has brought her to this moment to give a lead performance that’s as heartbreaking as it is side-splitting.How does she feel about the city that made it all possible? “I’ve been there for five years, which is when everyone says it starts to get fabulous – and goddamn is it fabulous!” she says. “So, yes – now I do love LA!”I Love LA is available on NOW in the UK, HBO in the US and HBO Max in Australia.Explore more on these topicsTelevisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

One of the most creative and viscerally thrilling exponents of that pivotal jazz art was Jack DeJohnette, the percussionist, pianist, composer and bandleader, who has died aged 83.DeJohnette’s CV glitters with the names of the biggest jazz stars of the second half of the 20th century, and with good reason. In his youth, he played genres from R&B to free-jazz in his hometown,Chicago(alongside some of the innovative founders of Chicago’s Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians – AACM – and occasionally playing in Sun Ra’s Arkestra), before joining the most widely celebrated of early jazz-rock fusion groups, led by the saxophonist Charles Lloyd and including a then-unknown young pianist called Keith Jarrett.DeJohnette then contributed to Miles Davis’s landmark early-1970s electric bands (the trumpet star’s improvisations taking off over what he called the drummer’s “deep groove”, which in Davis’s inner world meant a tightrope walk between rhythmic precision and unpredictability), but his resourceful subtlety in quieter acoustic settings was never blunted by those heavy-hitting environments.The proof lay in DeJohnette’s sensitive accompaniment of two virtuoso jazz pianists – Bill Evans, in 1968-69, and Jarrett, in his much-loved Standards Trio from 1983 to 2014.The Standards Trio – Keith Jarrett, piano, Gary Peacock, bass, and Jack DeJohnette – at the Jazz Jamboree, Warsaw, 1985DeJohnette also formed and led his own bands, New Directions and Special Edition, from the early 80s, notably on a series of fine horn-dominated albums with the saxophonists David Murray andArthur Blythe, and featuring his own considerable jazz-piano skills alongside his own emerging compositional voice. In his later years he toured and recorded occasionally as a solo pianist.The experience of DeJohnette live onstage was always enthralling, but his charisma was never a distraction from whatever music he was there to bring to life. Not only could he make a regular drumkit sound bigger and more sonically resourceful, but he could also make it sound entrancingly harmonious – partly by technique, and partly by meticulous attention to its tuning and design.If the band around him was playing a brisk blues, DeJohnette might eventually drag its tempo way down to a lament, in bumpy decelerating rolls, sudden wrong-footing pauses, and lurching snare-drum blows, like somebody crossing a stream on increasingly wide-spaced stones. On uptempo swingers, he could sustain a blur of surging cymbal patterns scattered with offbeat snare-drum smacks and clatters that seemed to draw both the band and the audience into leaning closer in, as if every emerging moment might be unmissable.An athletic, muscular drummer who played the kit at arm’s length as if boxing with it, he could maintain thundering funk/rock grooves for long stretches, as he often did for Davis on dark, turbulent sessions, such as Live Evil and Live at the Fillmore East in 1970. But in Jarrett’s sublimely lyrical acoustic trios, his sensitivities to tone-colour as well as rhythm, coupled with the all-round musicality and compositional sense of the sophisticated pianist he had learned to be from childhood, confirmed why he was in demand for so many jazz and global music stars over the years.Gateway – John Abercrombie, guitar, David Holland, bass, and Jack DeJohnetteBorn in Chicago’s South Side, Jack was the only child of Eva (nee Wood) and Jack DeJohnette Sr. Raised by his maternal grandmother, he began taking piano lessons at around the age of four, and his musical aptitudes were nurtured by his uncle, Roy Wood, a radio DJ, who would play him records by Duke Ellington andBillie Holiday.As a teenager, he began singing doo-wop, and playing rock piano modelled onFats Dominoin local bands – but was returned to jazz by the late 50s hits of the pianistAhmad Jamaland, particularly, Jamal’s quietly masterly drummerVernel Fournier.DeJohnette picked up percussion fast by listening to the era’s star drummers on record (notablyMax Roach, Art Blakey and Philly Joe Jones), and practising their ideas on an abandoned kit in his grandmother’s basement, and by the early 60s he was good enough to play with local heroes such as Sun Ra and the saxophonist Eddie Harris, and to successfully sit in with the emerging avant-jazz genius John Coltrane.Chicago’s AACM was a laboratory for originals including Anthony Braxton, Henry Threadgill and Roscoe Mitchell, and it wasMuhal Richard Abrams, co-founder of the association, who advised DeJohnette to move to New York, which brought him into the company of such modern-jazz luminaries as the saxophonistJoe Hendersonand the pianistMcCoy Tyner.His career then took off with the formation of Lloyd’s genre-bending jazz-rock quartet, and reached an even bigger and younger cross-genre audience with Davis’s dramatic and austerely invigorating groups of the early 70s. But in between had come a 1968 European tour with Evans’s trio, which included a Montreux jazz festival performance that won a Grammy in its recorded version – notably aided by the young DeJohnette’s willingness to push even the most revered of jazz elders beyond their comfort zones. That European trip also led the drummer to Ronnie Scott’s Old Place, a jamming haunt for exploratory London musicians through which DeJohnette met the saxophonist John Surman, and formed a long-running creative partnership with him.Touring in Europe in 1972, DeJohnette met Manfred Eicher, the founder of ECM Records, and an innovator who had long foreseen how global musical developments in jazz were moving. He began a long association with the label – most significantly through a renewal of his relationship with Jarrett.With Jarrett and the bassistGary Peacock, he was a cornerstone of the long-running Standards Trio, one of the great small groups in jazz history. Through ECM, he also fruitfully recorded with the guitaristJohn Abercrombieand the bassist Dave Holland – forming the superb Gateway trio with them in 1976 – and with Pat Metheny, the bassistCharlie Haden, and the saxophonistsDewey RedmanandMichael Breckeron Metheny’s double album 80/81.Jack DeJohnette with Pat Metheny, guitar, Herbie Hancock, piano, and Dave Holland, bass, playing Shadow DanceBetween 1979 and 1984, DeJohnette recorded a bold and personal sequence of ECM albums, Special Edition, Tin Can Alley and Album Album, featuring such powerful saxophonists as David Murray,Arthur Blytheand Chico Freeman, and revealing his own powers as a composer.In the 90s, he formed improv-oriented ensembles that included the keyboardist Michael Cain, and in the early 2000s explored contemplative and meditational music through the New Age projects Music in the Key of OM (2005) and Peace Time (2006).Two significant ventures of DeJohnette’s later years were his rough-hewn but spirited live reunion with his old Chicago bandmates Mitchell, Threadgill and Abrams, on Made in Chicago (2014), and the quartet set entitled Hudson (2017), with the guitarist John Scofield, keyboardist John Medeski and bassist Larry Grenadier, all of them residents of the Hudson Valley inNew YorkState.It was no cosy sentimental journey despite its covers of popular hits, however, but a full-blooded stretch for the formidable jazz talents of all of them. A Native American chant figured in the repertoire, a reference to Seminole and Crow connections in DeJohnette’s ancestry.In 2024, a previously unreleased 1966 recording – Forces of Nature: Live at Slugs’ – emerged as a captivating indication of what DeJohnette’s impact on the jazz scene of his early years must have sounded like, in an enthralling encounter at the famous New York club, with Henderson on saxophone, Tyner on piano, and Henry Grimes on bass.DeJohnette is survived by his second wife, Lydia (nee Herman), whom he married in 1968, and their daughters, Farah and Minya.Jack DeJohnette, drummer, pianist and composer, born 9 August 1942; died 26 October 2025Explore more on these topicsJazzMiles DavisChicagoDuke EllingtonBillie HolidayNew YorkobituariesShareReuse this content"

How will the world decide to use it?For parents who have buried infants born too soon, a device like the AquaWomb is a miracle in waiting – and an impossible choiceLucy TuWed 5 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 09.27 ESTShareBeth Schafer lay in a hospital bed, bracing for the birth of her son. The first contractions rippled through her body before she felt remotely ready. She knew, with a mother’s pit-of-the-stomach intuition, that her baby was not ready either.At just 23 weeks of gestation, her son teetered on the cliff edge of viability, the fragile threshold where modern medicine offers any promise of keeping babies alive.Beth’s son did not – could not – cry when he was born. The instant his entire body, small enough to cradle in a single palm, landed in the delivering doctor’s latexed hand, a swarm of blue scrubs closed in to begin resuscitation. But despite their fervent attempts to triage, to coax air into his tiny, caved-in lungs, they could not supply what Beth’s son needed most: more time in the womb.Beth is a 39-year-old painter turned graphic designer whose round frames and dark, frenzied bangs give her the look of an art student who never outgrew the studio. She will make you a mug of tea before you think to ask, the kind of person who says “I love that for you” and means every syllable. This is why I know she is not hyperbolizing when she talks about her perfect, precious son.“I would have moved mountains for him,” Beth tells me, two years after his birth.This kind of device would create a new stage of human development, something we’ve never had to describe or regulate beforeElizabeth Chloe RomanisScientists worldwide are racing to buy more time for extremely premature babies like Beth’s. In 2017, researchers in Philadelphia unveiled an experimental lifeline:an artificial womb, engineered to gestate babies outside the human body.In their study’s photos, fetal lambs floated inside what looked like overgrown Ziploc bags, eyes closed and hearts pumping as if they had never left their mothers. That prototype was only tested on animals, but the technology is edging closer to human use.In September 2023, the United States Food and Drug Administration convened an advisory committee to consider whether to greenlight the first clinical trials. If approved, the first candidates will be babies like Beth’s son, those born between 22 and 24 weeks of gestation, or less than two-thirds of the way to full term. (FDA representatives declined to comment on whether or when these trials might begin.)In the US,more than 10,000 infantsare born each year within these precarious boundaries. Premature birth remains the nation’ssecond-leading causeof infant death, and even those who survive may face crippling complications, from chronic lung disease to lifelong neurological damage.Artificial wombs promise to change that trajectory, saving more babies and sparing more parents from grief. But growing a child outside the body also cuts to the core of how people imagine pregnancy and parenthood.“This kind of device would create a new stage of human development, something we’ve never had to describe or regulate before,” says Elizabeth Chloe Romanis, a medical law scholar at Durham University.In this way, artificial wombs tug at a taut tightrope of questions that scientists, bioethicists and legal experts are scrambling to cross before human trials begin: how will this technology affect the ways we intervene in preserving life, or how we define life itself?When I first see the prototype, I don’t think of a womb. I think of an aquarium.The glass tank rests on a waist-high platform in a bright laboratory in Aachen, Germany, one of the sites affiliated with AquaWomb, a Dutch startup that is developing devices to improve health outcomes for the smallest, sickest infants.About the size of a household fishtank, the vessel sits under fluorescent lights so technicians can monitor every movement inside, though in practice it would be covered to mimic the dimness of the womb. Tubes coil from the sides into filters that cycle synthetic amniotic fluid in rhythmic glugs.The design feels apt for extremely premature infants, who often arrive looking as though they belong to another world entirely – skin translucent and gelatinous, limbs thin as matchsticks. In this tank, those babies could float, drink, urinate and grow without touching air.View image in fullscreenReplica premature babies.Photograph: TU/e [Eindhoven University of Technology/Bart van OverbeekeMyrthe van der Ven, a technical physician and the co-founder and CEO of AquaWomb, shows me how their prototype mimics the constant shelter of pregnancy. The amniotic fluid holds at 99.7F, just above a mother’s core temperature. A double-layered bag hangs in the tank’s center. Its inner sac flexes as the baby grows, from pomegranate-sized at 23 weeks to the heft of an eggplant by 28. The outer silicone layer is stiffer, with just enough give to resist the baby’s kicks and encourage its muscles to stretch and strengthen.The tank, van der Ven tells me, is the simple part. The lungs are the true liability.During a typical birth, a newborn’s first gulp of air triggers the breathing reflex, often announced with a wail that signals lungs at work. That moment comes too early for extremely premature infants: their runty lungs can’t sustain even a whisper, much less nourish the developing brain and body.It’s like juggling 10 balls … only the balls are on fire and dropping one is not an optionIn today’s neonatal intensive care units, doctors can only step in after the fact, using ventilators and incubators to force these fragile organs to function. That mechanical intervention brings its own risks of lasting injury. And once exposed to air, the lungs are irreversibly activated; you can’t throw the fish back into the water.Artificial wombs aim to bypass this crisis altogether. In AquaWomb’s design, the baby is delivered via caesarean section into a fluid-filled pouch, where it can be transferred from mother to machine. Once inside the transfer chamber, clinicians reattach the umbilical cord to a human-made placenta, a fist-sized device lined with catheters delicate enough to pull carbon dioxide from the blood and cannulas robust enough to push oxygen and nutrients in.If it works, the placenta buys time that the baby’s lungs cannot yet provide. If it fails, the clock runs out in two minutes, the limit before oxygen deprivation risks permanent brain damage. The baby must remain immersed in fluid throughout this entire sequence, never realizing it is being born.“It’s like juggling 10 balls,” says Frans van de Vosse, a professor in cardiovascular biomechanics at Eindhoven University of Technology who advises the project. “Only the balls are on fire and dropping one is not an option.”If perfected, an artificial womb could rewrite the limits of viability. Perhaps this is why the handful of labs working on these machines hesitate even to name them.AquaWomb describes its prototype as a “womb-like life support system”. (They are wary of the political and science-fiction associations attached to the term “artificial womb”.) And the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), considered the closest group to human clinical trials, called theirs a “biobag”. CHOP’s device made headlines in 2017, when researchers kept fetal lambs alive for 28 days, proving an artificial womb could sustain blood circulation and organ development in a living animal.The entire field operates under a veil of secrecy. CHOP representatives declined to comment for this story. (Vitara Biomedical, the private company that licensed CHOP’s artificial womb technology, has raised more than$125m, a sign they might be preparing for clinical trials.) Some researchers told me CHOP scientists have agreed to collaboration meetings, then backed out.The guardedness reflects both the scrutiny surrounding reproductive technology and the knowledge that, as van der Ven puts it, “in science, there’s evolutionary and there’s revolutionary”. An artificial womb would be the latter.Her team is not trying to win the race at all costs. “We don’t need to be the first. We want to be the best,” she says. For her, that means designing a system where parents can interact with their gestating babies, a priority she feels other researchers have overlooked. One AquaWomb prototype includes access ports that let parents touch their infants. Another features a “uterus phone”, which pipes voices, music or heartbeats into the fluid at the same muffled pitch a fetus would hear in the womb.Those parent-child interactions – pressing a fingertip against a foot, speaking into the fluid, feeling a shift inside the bag – could improvelong-termhealthoutcomesfor premature infants. But the stakes of parental bonding during pregnancy go beyond survival statistics.Research on families’ experiences within-vitro fertilization and surrogacysuggests that when pregnancy departs from the normal course, parents – especially mothers – may struggle to feel like proper caregivers. Extremely premature births can invokesimilarfeelings, in part because prematurity is usually caused by medical complications with the mother rather than the child.“They may not feel they’ve fulfilled their ‘duty’ to protect and carry their child,” says Romanis. Sheargues that any ethical alternativeto “natural” pregnancy must address parents’ emotional needs alongside infants’ physiological ones.In other words, seeing your baby suspended in a tank or sealed in a bag could alter not only how you connect with them, but how you see yourself as a parent.Three months after losing her son, Beth joined a biweekly support group for parents who have experienced late-term pregnancy loss or whose newborns died soon after birth, often because of extreme prematurity. Attenders discuss what to do with unopened baby gifts or how to deflect well-meaning questions from relatives and co-workers. Many are parents of children who might have been prime candidates for an artificial womb.When Beth invites me to join her, I picture a lecture hall or hospital conference room. Instead, we arrive at the basement of a Boston church, where Wendy, a therapist who leads the group, arranges a circle of folding chairs. Attenders trickle in.View image in fullscreenJuliette van Haren with research components for a transfer device and artificial womb for premature babies.Photograph: TU/e [Eindhoven University of Technology/Bart van OverbeekeOnly one of today’s 17 attenders is a man. (He and his husband lost their daughter when their surrogate miscarried late in pregnancy.) Across from me sits a girl who looks too young to order a drink at the bar, let alone to have already had and buried a baby. Her peroxide blond hair brushes the salt-and-pepper nest of Joanne, who is nearly 60 and has been attending for three years, having joined the group over a decade after losing her son. The group also includes an English professor, stay-at-home mom, police officer and pediatric nurse.In this circle, I see how pregnancy loss is unequally borne, but grief is indiscriminate.No one knows how long the group has existed. Membership is word-of-mouth. “We tried making a Facebook group once,” Beth tells me, “But it got overtaken by anti-vaxxers asking if we’d had the Covid vaccine.”“And then my account got suspended because I told them to fuck off,” Joanne snorts. “When I lost my baby, I also lost my patience for dealing with grown-ass babies.”Wendy lays a hand on Joanne’s wrist and winks at me. “As you can see, we’re very open here. You can ask us about your baby bags.”“Biobags”, I utter through hiccupy laughs, unprepared for their nonchalance. I explain that the technology is still several years from hospitals, and even then, would probably be offered only to infants born at 22 or 23 weeks, who have paltry alternatives.“I lost my baby at 22 weeks,” Joanne interrupts. “Are you saying this could have saved him?”“Maybe,” I admit. “But not necessarily. Hypothetically, if your doctors thought he was a candidate for an artificial womb, would you have …”“Absolutely,” Joanne insists. “All I wanted was to save him. If my body couldn’t do that, then maybe this womb thing could.”The parents crave more morsels of information to feed their hypotheticals:Could my baby have survived at 21 weeks? How much would it cost? Would I be able to see my daughter? Hold her?Two women grimace when I describe the prototypes, but the others lean forward and ask for photographs. They picture their children in an artificial womb, submerged in the soothing embrace of synthetic dreams.These parents do not know exactly what the technology could have given them, but it is agonizingly clear that they understand what they have lost without it. Most have not disassembled their babies’ cribs. The pediatric nurse contemplates switching specialties because she cannot be around newborns without wanting to cry. And Beth often clutches her belly as she speaks, like she is cradling a child who is no longer there.Maybe there is a future world where every parent can access this technology … How will they know whether it’s the right decisionWendyEach parent is haunted by what could have been done differently. Most cling to the idea that more intervention, more technology, might have saved their babies.Wendy hesitates. “Is more always better?” She recounts delivering her daughter via C-section at 24 weeks and begging her doctors to administer aggressive care. Despite the precarious birth, the doctors saved Wendy’s baby in the operating room, compressing her chest to churn blood to her brain. For four months in the Nicu (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit), her daughter lived tethered to lines and flushed with drugs. These were costly, painful procedures. But her stunted lungs needed more time to mature.Wendy needed more time, too. “The prognosis was bad, but when it comes to your kid, you can’t help but keep praying for a miracle. I couldn’t let her go.”After 131 days, her daughter died from a collapsed lung. For months, Wendy was racked with guilt, hot and salty grief leaking down her face. “I felt so selfish,” she says. “Even though I eventually let go of those feelings, I wish I’d given her a more peaceful, less prolonged end.”Although she supports the development of artificial wombs, Wendy wonders how doctors will obtain informed consent from parents who are desperate to save their babies. “Maybe there is a future world where every parent can access this technology,” she says. “How will they know whether it’s the right decision? For the baby, or for them.”“I can’t stop looking at the photos of the lambs in the baggies,” Beth tells me, a week after my first visit to her support group. “Probably should stop doing it right before lunch.”Thefootage of CHOP’s animal trialsunsettled her, not only the sight of slick pink bodies drifting in fluid, but also its eerie resemblance to a scene from The Matrix, where human infants are farmed in industrial pods.For decades, scientists and science-fiction writers alike have been chasing the stork. In 1958, a Swedish team tried to sustainseven “pre-viable” human fetusesin what was essentially a pressure-cooker incubator with a pump to oxygenate blood. Their test lasted only a few hours, and modern ethics boards would recoil at the crude attempt to create an artificial womb. Still, what had once been a thought experiment briefly took on flesh.Today’s artificial womb prototypes are neither capable of nor designed to supplant natural pregnancy. Nonetheless, when CHOP published its research on biobags, it birthed a stream of sensational speculations around “complete ectogenesis”, where fertilization to birth occurs entirely outside a woman’s uterus.Researchers have tried to tamp down those associations, positioning their work as a giant leap forward for science but an unremarkable tiptoe for parenthood.View image in fullscreenThe Perinatal Life Support system from startup AquaWomb focuses on a safe transition from the mother to the baby’s water incubator. Here, a specially developed, realistic and advanced baby doll demonstrates how this could happen.Photograph: TU/e [Eindhoven University of Technology/Bart van Overbeeke“The concept of complete ectogenesis is so far away that it’s not worth talking about in relation to the current work,” says one scientist working on artificial wombs. (He speaks to me on the condition of anonymity to avoid upsetting his public relations representative.) “Premature babies die every day, and this technology could save at least some of them. If you want to sit around debating The Matrix, you’re missing the point.”Other experts believe these concerns can’t be brushed aside.“There is no such thing as ‘not worth talking about’ when it comes to procreative futures. Science fiction and science fact aren’t so far divorced when it comes to thinking about what might be a problem,” Romanis says.She adds that, even in its earliest form, an artificial womb would confront parents with agonizing choices. This makes me think about Wendy, who wondered how a parent, driven by the desperate hope of saving their child, could understand the implications of placing their baby in a highly experimental device.On this point, such clinicians such as Christoph Haller, a cardiovascular surgeon in Toronto, describe artificial wombs as an opportunity for continuity rather than rupture. His team istesting their own prototype on fetal pigs. “The conversations with parents won’t be entirely new,” he says. “We already have to ask them to make impossible decisions: do we intubate, do we operate, do we stop? With any new technology, we’ll keep being honest about what we know and what we don’t.”But no one writes dystopian novels about IV drips or ventilators. With artificial wombs, the fantasy – and the fear – are built in.Would my husband and I even have used a surrogate if something like this had been available?That becomes clear when I return to the grief group a month after my first visit. Beth again raises the lamb photos. Joanne nods quickly. “I keep looking at them too. If that bag had been around, maybe I wouldn’t be sitting here. I’d have signed anything to get another few weeks.”Across the circle, a younger woman shakes her head sharply. “That’s just it. You wouldn’t have had a choice. They’d cram your baby in whether you wanted them to or not.” She won’t say whotheyare – politicians, doctors, hospitals – but the suspicion hangs heavy. “People already treat you like you’re selfish if you don’t do every single intervention. This would be one more thing they’d hold over you.”The man who lost his daughter during surrogacy clears his throat. “I can’t help wondering, would my husband and I even have used a surrogate if something like this had been available? Maybe the right thing would be to avoid putting another person at risk by asking them to carry a pregnancy.”The room vibrates with competing anxieties: that the technology will not arrive soon enough, and that it might arrive too fast. Here, the debates over biology versus technology, care versus coercion, compress into a small circle of folding chairs. And no matter where one falls on these questions, it would be naive to ignore their gravity.During our final meeting, Beth wears denim overalls speckled with talcum-colored paint. Strips of tape adorn the trim of an otherwise empty room. Beth grips a soaked brush bigger than her face, and the nursery walls around us are still wet enough to smell.“This is the last step,” she tells me.For months after her son died, Beth refused to enter the nursery she had built for him. Then, she joined the pregnancy grief group, where Wendy advised her to “take baby steps when packing up the room” (“No pun intended,” Beth says wearily).On her first attempt, Beth’s knees buckled just five steps beyond the doorway. “The room felt like a memorial for someone who had barely been alive,” she says. She tried again a week later, this time taking two stuffed animals when she left. Two days later, she came again.Item by item, Beth took apart the nursery. She numbed herself to the objects she removed: crocheted baby bootees; a half-completed scrapbook with maternity photos of Beth and her now ex-husband, palms tenderly pressed against her pregnant belly. She hired someone else to disassemble the crib.We talk about artificial wombs while she runs her brush over the nursery walls. The mural on the far wall – a hand-painted landscape of a mountain range – is the last to disappear. “If this technology existed, would I be a bad mom if I didn’t use it?” she wonders.Maha is backing this ‘natural’ infertility treatment. Is it the right’s path to limiting IVF?Read moreFor the scientists and doctors at the forefront of artificial womb technology, Beth’s fears might signal the dangers of letting science-fiction fantasies overshadow the tangible lifesaving benefits these technologies offer. But they may also reflect an indecision inherent to parenthood: the dread of making the wrong choice between what youcanandshoulddo for your child.If Beth’s son had been born 20 years later, he might have had a different brush with life. In one version of this alternate future, he grows in an artificial womb that saves his life. Beth fills her scrapbook with Polaroids of her baby, his toes snuggled into knitted bootees.In another version, Beth’s son is placed into an artificial womb: the doctors know he faces long odds and are willing to give him a fighting chance. Beth watches her baby grow in the tank and prays for a miracle. But the odds don’t tilt in his favor; the miracle does not materialize.Would Beth feel better, believing she had done everything she could to save him? Or would she for ever wonder whether her choices prolonged her son’s life, and his possible pain, for the same outcome?These are the considerations that underlie the overarching debate of how we should use artificial wombs when they become available. And if research labs and FDA committees are where resolutions to these questions are codified, then the choices of parents like Beth are where they are brought to life.“There aren’t any easy answers here for me, or for any parent,” Beth says. For now, she just keeps painting.Explore more on these topicsInfant and child mortalityParents and parentingFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was established around the same time that early civilizations in the Middle East and Asia were developing.Archaeologists say the people of Caral took with them their sophisticated decorative techniques of temple pyramids and sunken circular plazas to the new cities, which also featured new imagery telling their survival story to future generations.One such set of images was discovered at Vichama on the walls of a temple on top of a raised platform in the desert. It is formed of three-dimensional mural reliefs that depict emaciated corpses with sunken bellies and protruding ribs; on a second wall above and set back there are pregnant women, ritual dancers and a pair of large fish.Above both, on a higher wall, is an almost cartoonish design which shows the face of a toad emerging with human hands being struck in the head by a lightning bolt.“After the deaths, the empty stomachs, a toad appears, emerging from the Earth with lightning striking its head, as if announcing the arrival of water,” said Shady.View image in fullscreenDr Ruth Shady speaks to visitors at the Vichama archaeological site.Photograph: Dan Collyns/The GuardianThe drought which afflicted Caral may have been part of a putative mega drought,known as 4.2ka, which some archaeologists believe forced people to abandon thriving cities in Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley and farther afield. It may have brought about the collapse of many ancient civilisations.Archaeologists have found up to 18 structures, including residential complexes, in Peñico that strongly resemble the architectural style in the older city of Caral, which was founded about 800 years earlier.“What stands out most is the organisation and the layout of the settlement, the structure and design of their buildings,” said Mauro Ordoñez, the chief archaeologist at Peñico. “For the era, it tells us that the organisation was based on a political-ideological structure and there is an absence of objects that leave evidence of violence.”Peñico appears to have been a strategic hub between the coast, the Andean Cordillera and the Amazon beyond. Archaeologists have found the skeletons of monkeys and macaws that would have been brought over the mountains from the jungle, as well as ceramics depicting them. The colourful and charismatic animals may well have been used in ceremonies by shamans or leaders to denote status.Unfired clay artefacts depict men and women of status with red painted faces and styled hair, indicating gender parity. Seashells from Ecuador’s tropical coast show a “constant relationship” with people from the north, as well as the south, east and west.Food remnants show bones of fish from the Pacific Ocean, cotton, fruit and vegetables such as sweet potato, avocado, maize, squash and chili pepper. Trade appears to have thrived in open-air markets – much as they do in modern Peru – said Ordoñez.Sculpted reliefs of the pututu, a conch shell trumpet still used in Andean religious ceremonies, adorn the walls of the central plaza. They were symbols of authority, said Ordoñez, and continue to symbolize Andean identity and resistance.View image in fullscreenFriezes left behind in the new settlements carried a message for future generations to “not forget” what had caused the climate catastrophe in Caral, Shady says.Photograph: Dan Collyns/The GuardianShady’s discovery of Caral and its 32 monumental buildings rewrote the history books. Her findings astonished her fellow archaeologists by showing that the Americas also had a society that was contemporaneous with the first great civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, India and China.Now, evidence is growing that, faced with a climate crisis, the civilization did not disappear but adapted and moved. Predating the Inca, the Maya and the Aztecs by millennia, these civilisations had complex trade systems, gender equality and apparently coexisted in peace.Shady believes Peruvians can learn much from their ancestors about “living in harmony with nature”.Squatters issue death threats to archaeologist who discovered oldest city in the AmericasRead moreTatiana Abad, the chief archaeologist at Vichama, says the legacy of the Spanish conquest continues to affect Peruvians. “[The Spanish] considered that this was not a civilization, that it was an uncivilized society, but the latest research shows that neither writing nor the wheel were necessary to achieve a complex society.”Vichama and its evocative imagery is testament to that. Another temple frieze shows snakes, also associated with water, entwined around the faces of the dead. Beneath them is a smiling, almost comical being that looks like a cross between an octopus and a video game space invader.Shady believes the anthropomorphic image represents a joyous seed promising future harvests, an end to the famine and the triumph of life after a climate crisis.Explore more on these topicsArchaeologyClimate crisisAnthropologyPeruAmericasDroughtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As Zohran Mamdani’s victory shows, people are desperate for policies that actually improve livesWed 5 Nov 2025 11.28 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 11.50 ESTShareIstarted my working life as a care worker on casual terms, not knowing if there would be a pay cheque from month to month. It was a good, unionised job, with decent conditions, that changed my life, and the lives of the workers I would go on to represent as a trade unionist.From my travels around the country as an MP, I have heard from so many people who are in the same position I was in. They want change, they want fairness, and they want respect at work. That’s why the Labour party promised toupgrade workers’ rights in our manifestofor the last election. In government, we are determined to see this through, ushering in what we promised: anew deal for working people.Theemployment rights billis back in the House of Commons today. If it remains intact and passes into law, it will ensure that ordinary people are better off – with basic rights from day one, turning the tide on precariousness and exploitation.This gamechanging package of measures includes protection from unfair dismissal, strengthened sick pay, bereavement leave, action against sexual harassment at work, a ban on zero-hours contracts, an end to fire and rehire, and a genuine living wage. It means family rights such as flexible working and parental leave from day one, stronger protections for pregnant women, and steps to tackle the gender pay gap. It also includes an historic fair pay agreement in social care – a new, legally binding pledge that will set minimum pay and employment terms for care workers in England and improve the standard of care.Labour has humane and popular plans to stand up for UK workers. Why dilute them?  | Gaby HinsliffRead moreTaken together, this package would be the single biggest boost to rights at work in a generation. And yet, our bill has faced fierce criticism from the Tories and Reform, and relentless lobbying from vested interests. Unelected Tory lords inserting amendments that, unless overturned, would weaken the bill to the point that it no longer met our manifesto pledges to provide basic rights from day one on the job, and to end exploitative zero-hours contracts with guaranteed hours. Today, as MPs vote in the Commons on their latest attempts to water down the bill, it is time forLabourto stand firm and make clear we are the party for working people.The attacks we face are hardly surprising. Every time we have made progress on employment rights over the last 45 years, they have been resisted – from the maternity allowance to equal pay for women, health and safety rights, or the minimum wage.The last Conservative government took regressive measures, such as shamefully doubling the qualification period for protectionagainst unfair dismissal to two years. They stripped workers of protections at the stroke of a pen. Now they are at it again, with brazen attempts to water down this flagship legislation. They must again be resisted.Preserving and passing the employment rights bill into law is not just fulfilling a manifesto commitment – it is about fixing a broken model.Key measures in this bill have been backed by many of the best businesses. They know that if you treat people well, you get the best out of them. They recognise that being pro-worker is not a barrier to success, but a launchpad to it. That is why this bill takes the very best standards from the very best businesses and extends them to millions more workers. It is also why we proudly say that this is a pro-business and pro-worker bill.This landmark legislation will give working people across the country security and dignity that they will be able to feel. As Tuesday evening’sresults in New Yorkshow, growth only means something to ordinary working people if they can see it and communities have something to show for it.These measures will be tangible to the thousands of pregnant women and mothers who will benefit from new maternity protections, and the tens of thousands of fathers and partners who will be brought into the scope of paternity leave. In every corner of this country, millions will benefit from a decent wage and secure work they can raise a family on – 1.7 million will benefit from new policies on flexible working, 2 million will receive a right to bereavement leave, 9 million employees will benefit from protection against unfair dismissal from day one.This is a once-in-a-generation chance to reshape the world of work, to drive a race to the top on standards, to deliver growth and build an economy that works for everyone. This bill was the promise we made to the British public. It is our duty to deliver it. So I will support my frontbench colleagues every step of the way in doing just that.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Pretend it’s not there. 2. Acknowledge it is. 3. Convince myself it’s growingWed 5 Nov 2025 12.45 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 14.46 ESTShareTheNHSis a funny fish. It often kind of almost works brilliantly. Almost but frustratingly, not quite.I had this thing on the back of my shoulder which, being where it was, I couldn’t quite see. I could feel it though. A moley, warty thing. I’ll spare you a fuller description.And so I embarked upon my tried-and-tested routine for dealing with vaguely troubling symptoms: 1. Pretend it’s not there. 2. Acknowledge it is. 3. Convince myself it’s growing. 4. Get a loved one to take a photo of it. 5. Examine photo, gagging slightly. 6. Send to doctor friend, who says go to GP. 7. Forget about it. 8. Remember it. 9. Try and fail to get GP appointment. 10. Forget about it again. 11. Remember it again. 12. Try harder to get GP appointment and therefore succeed.All this time of course, I’m veering between two opposing convictions: one that it’s fatal, two that it’s nothing. And in the gap between those things, nothing happens.Furthermore, I should confess that between stages 5 and 6, I complicated matters by picking the bloody thing almost clean off. It came back with a vengeance, looking angrier than before. So whatever I consider to be the shortcomings of the NHS, I’m ever mindful that often they’re dealing with chumps like me.The GP said it was probably nothing but I should get it checked. She gave me a referral code to log in and secure my appointment. So far so good. She said not to worry about the words “suspected”, “urgent” and “cancer” on the form, as this was just to get the whole thing moving. Nice. Reassuring, I think. And the referral system seemed robust. Good use of IT, technology, the app etc. Well done, everybody.I burrowed into the website, filled in lots of things, moving like I was doing well at a video game from one level to the next. And then a dead end. A dead end in the form of a message that there were no appointments available at the hospital to which I’d been referred. And, as far as I could see, no appointments anywhere else. And, as with a video game, there’s no one to call. Shrug. There was a box to leave a message/wail of despair, so I put in my number and email and hoped someone would be in touch.If I’d got a holding email advising not to panic and that they’d be in touch, that would have helpedTwo days later I’d heard not a peep. Even if I’d got a holding email advising not to panic and that they’d be in touch, that would have helped. In the absence of that, for all I knew I was lost forever in the system. A lack of trust on my behalf perhaps? Possibly. If so, my bad. But I considered my options. I could wait, possibly in vain, to hear from someone. Or I could go back to my GP and take up more of her time. Or go private.One specialist had no appointments until December but would look at a photo of what I was worried about for £250. The cheek of it. In the end, I found a £210 appointment at a skin clinic in a swanky part of town. Obviously I’m fortunate to be able to countenance going private. I did so partly because the anxiety was doing my head in; partly out of thinking at least I was saving the NHS the bother.This place was in a little mews. The air was fragrant. The receptionist looked like a model. I stammered something about a warty lesion and soon a charming dermatologist led me to her consulting room. “Let’s check you all over,” she said.I stripped down to my pants for her to commence an exhaustive assessment of all my blemishes. Very few were moles. Except when she had a look at my bottom, at which point she exclaimed that I had more moles there than everywhere else put together. I felt a flush of pride, for some reason. I won’t tell you where she looked next, save to say, rather her than me. And she was polite enough to ask permission first. The whole process, which was leisurely and stressful in equal measure, took 45 minutes.I know I should stop writing about zips. But I’ve just suffered another outrage | Adrian ChilesRead moreAs for the thing on my shoulder, it needed to come off and be sent away to be checked, just in case. For this the price was £610. She said that I might as well wait for the NHS to get in touch and get it done for nothing. But this didn’t feel like cricket to me either.As I mulled it over, my phone rang. The NHS had suddenly sprung to life, rather too urgently for my liking, and within minutes I was making my way to a major teaching hospital in a less swanky part of town. No messing around here counting the moles on my arse cheeks, I tell you. The dermatologist called me in, sat me down and had a look at my thing. He said it might or might not be cancer, but either way needed digging out sooner rather than later, and they’d be in touch.I was in and out of there in 10 minutes flat. He’d said basically the same as the gentle woman had told me only an hour earlier, albeit making the cancer/not cancer outcome sound more like a 50/50 shot. If I was rating the experience on Trustpilot I’d have said it was bracingly businesslike, if a little lacking in the bedside-manner department. But fine, no complaints.Then, 10 days after my double-derm day I’d still not heard a thing about an appointment for the excision, and there was no one to call. My faith in the system was again ebbing away so I resolved to find £610 and be done with it. At which point I suddenly got a phone call, a text, an email and a message to the NHS app. From no communication, to too much.So it is, that at the time of writing, I’m off back to see the same brusque bloke to have the offending whatever-it-is excised. Bring it on. I doubt it’ll take him long.

Even his mum had been calling him to debate what it meant.He makes a fair point. The warmup to the budget has been far too drawn-out and the chancellor’s clunky exercise this week in trying to manage expectations, even if it was primarily aimed at the bond market, only added to the sense of confusion. The budget should have happened a month ago.M&S boss says Reeves made customers more worried with pre-budget speechRead moreStill, back in the day job, Machin can reasonably claim “the incident” –the Easter cyber-attackthat took out the website for six weeks and had M&S employees resort to pen and paper for stock-keeping – will be viewed as just “an extraordinary moment in time”.The food side of operation has been quicker to recover, which always seemed likely because its supply chains are more UK-focused and move faster anyway. Food sales in the half were up 7.8%, maintaining the multi-year run of outpacing inflation. The cyber-pain showed in lower profit margins as manual stock control meant more waste.The clothing and home division has been a slower slog in restoring availability – and slower than expected, conceded Machin. Losing data for weeks means losing forecasting ability, which affects everything from ordering garments to the personalisation of emails to Sparks loyalty card holders. Sales declined by 16.4% in the half, with the website obviously being the major drag.View image in fullscreenM&S chief executive Stuart Machin called Rachel Reeves’ pre-budget speech on Tuesday a ‘nothing’ announcement that will just make consumers more worried.Photograph: Neil Hall/EPABut May’s preliminary estimate of the trading damage to profits has proved roughly accurate. Machin suggested £300m-ish back then; now he’s talking £324m, of which £100m is covered by insurance. The City viewed that as reassuring. The lingering hangover should clear fully by early next year.At that point, everybody can look again at the story of more expansion in food, where the aim is to double sales over the long term, and the churn in the estate of “full line” stores.View image in fullscreenStuart Machin, chief executive of M&S.The latter is an exercise in closing smaller units and opening a few bigger, and more efficient, stores and still has many more laps to run. So it feels highly likely that, after this year’s whack to profits, M&S’s numbers for the 2026-27 financial year should be what it would have achieved anyway. The round number of £1bn of pre-tax profits may follow the year after, think City analysts.The stock market was never overly worried by the cyber-attack, it should be said. It took the clinical view that, ultimately, one lost year of profit progress does not seriously alter the value of a business worth £8bn if the medium-term trajectory is intact, which it is, and if the balance sheet is conservative, which is also the case.Over the course of the year, M&S’s shares have gone roughly sideways. In the cyber-damage stakes, the severity was not atJaguar Land Roverlevels. Reeves’ budget, as it affects the spending power of consumers, does indeed loom larger.Explore more on these topicsBusinessNils Pratley on financeMarks & SpencerRetail industryCybercrimeBudgetcommentShareReuse this content"

Look it up, and you have a perfect thumbnail of the modern information environment, its highs and lows. You can find out the exact words used by the event host, Stephen Colbert, as he introduced her and announced that the 23-year-old singerwas giving away$11.5m (£8.8m) to fight food poverty and the climate crisis. You can find out the exact words she used after she took the stage. “We’re in a time right now where the world is really, really bad and really dark and people need empathy and help more than kind of ever, especially in our country,” she said. You can also get straight to the controversial bit. “Love you all, but there’s a few people in here that have a lot more money than me. If you’re a billionaire, why are you a billionaire? No hate, but yeah, give your money away, shorties.”You can get an instant read on Mark Zuckerberg’s reaction, at least if you believe the New York Post – he was there while his wife, Priscilla Chan, received an award, and he signalled his displeasure by reportedlyrefusing to clap. You can do a deep dive on what Eilish meant by “shortie” (was it a catcall, an endearment or a simple statement of that fact that Zuckerberg is 5ft 7in and, by sheer coincidence, so is Jeff Bezos?). And you’ll find plenty of global backlash, so familiar and predictable that it feels almost naive to question its assumptions. “As gen Z are wont to do,” oneSky News Australia presenter said, “she seems to be a bit of a socialist, despite the fact that she has millions and millions of dollars in the bank.” He segues straight to Zohran Mamdani, the new mayor of New York City, noting that his biggest support is from “high-income earners”.These are the basic rules if you want to critique the billionaire class: you cannot be wealthy yourself; if you’re in politics, you cannot be supported, even at the ballot box, by anyone wealthy. These strictures are rigid but not quantified; there is no “poor enough” you can be to get a pass. You could be on the minimum wage, but still be too educated, or from too middle class a family. You could give 100% of your money away, but if you said something and the world listened, you would still have the privilege of a platform.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is pretty broad agreement, not limited to generation Z or the socialist republic of New York, that this minuscule wealth class undermines democracy in myriad ways, that they mostly erode workplace rights and drive down wages, that the pharaohs of tech are algorithmically mushing our brains, that their philanthropy is often sleight of hand, that they don’t want to fix the climate crisis – indeed, they are actively looking forward to the apocalypse with a side order of civil war, because it means there will be fewer of us. But we rigorously avoid the logical conclusion: that maybe having a billion dollars in the first place is innately bad.And now Eilish has casually slammed it on the table.

Despite all the odds, a 34-year-old Muslim Democratic socialist has been elected to lead the largest city in the United States. Zohran Mamdani’s win is a huge victory for all New Yorkers, but it is also meaningful far beyond the five boroughs of this city.Just as amazing was that this election wasn’t even close. Mamdani’s main opponent, formerNew Yorkgovernor Andrew Cuomo, ran a campaign that was as devoid of imagination as it was of hope and even personality. Having dramatically lost the democratic primary this past summer, Cuomo was forced to run as an independent, an almost comical political affiliation for a man whose campaign was utterly dependent on donations from the billionaire class.Mamdani’s run was completely different.Fundedoverwhelmingly by donations under $100 and fueled substantially more by human capital than greenbacks – over 100,000 peoplevolunteeredfor the campaign – Mamdani’s campaign mobilized a level of civic participation in local politics that I have never witnessed in the more than three decades I’ve lived in this city.The chattering classes of American media mostly ignored this hard and dedicated work by largely faceless volunteers, wanting instead to focus on all the wrong reasons for his win. He’s charismatic and good looking, theysaid(though Trump, of course, believesheis better looking). He’s winning because he’sgoodat social media. He’s successful because his supporters arelonelypeople.If only it were that easy. The real reason Mamdani has won is that he is the candidate who best understood what the people of New York want and need at this moment. He took the debilitating amount of economic anxiety that so many Americans are suffering through right now and turned it into a message of economic justice, believing that we all should be able to afford to live in the city we call home. He took the political anxiety that so many of us feel right now, as authoritarianism emanates from Washington DC, and turned it into New York pride for its legendary rambunctious spirit. (“To get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us,” he said during his victory speech.”)He refused to compromise on the rights of the Palestinian people to live in dignity. The last one is particularly significant. The old guard has long believed that expressions for Palestinian rights were equivalent to an electoral kiss of death. For the last year, they have predicted his downfall for this reason alone almost daily. Now, he has proved every single one of them wrong.From the beginning of Mamdani’s rise in this election, it was clear that none of the old political logic was working. Regardless, his opponents continued to believe that his defeat must be premised on their own appeals to the vilest racism. Queens Republican Vickie Paladino, a New York City council member,demandedMamdani be deported, and she questioned if he had been a citizen long enough to be elected mayor. During a radio interview, Cuomolaughedwhen the host claimed that Mamdani would “be cheering” another 9/11. “That’s another problem,” the former governor responded. Then, the day before the election, a political action committee supporting Cuomorana disgusting ad with Mamdani in front of video of the twin towers crashing down on 9/11.The real lesson of the election, however, is that this noxious racism didn’t work. “No more will New York be a city where you can traffic in Islamophobia and win an election,” Mamdani said in his victory speech.That doesn’t mean that Islamophobia has been summarily defeated, any more than it means that economic injustice has been ultimately vanquished. Years from now, this electoral victory will be seen as the easy part. The real work, as we all know, lies ahead.But what’s unique about this victory is that the Mamdani campaign has mobilized so many people locally to fight the good fight. The possibilities are as necessary as they are exciting. The election, both in its campaign and its results, have shown that the citizens of New York City are ready to actively forge a better future for all and together as one. The future is local.It’s no surprise that the Mamdani campaign hasresonatedso loudly across the world. In a time when rightwing authoritarianism is rising dangerously and globally, Mamdani’s win is an object lesson in how left, local, and participatory politics can win. During his victory speech, the now incoming mayor expressed the kernel of this truth, and he did so in Arabic, the first time I can remember hearing this routinely vilified language in a politician’s acceptance speech in the United States.To me, this is not just a simplistic politics of recognition. On the contrary. What Mamdani said points to how this message will travel from New York to Marseille to Berlin and beyond. It may be the key to our survival at this moment, and we should all listen to it carefully. “Ana minkum wa ilaikum,” he said, which means: “I am of you and for you.”Now, we hold him to those words, and we hold ourselves to them as well.Moustafa Bayoumi is Guardian US coolumnistExplore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniOpinionNew YorkUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But a year in, that resolve is crumblingWed 5 Nov 2025 06.56 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 11.35 ESTShareKemi Badenoch has recently marked her first anniversary as leader, and much of the commentary (to the extent that the Tories manage to garner any commentary) has focused on one thing: the fact that she can now be formally challenged for the role.The significance of this milestone should not, however, be overstated. Unlike the Labour party, theConservativesdo not really have an internal regime governed by rigid rules. The one-year grace period for a new leader is simply a rule adopted by the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs, and they could dispose of it simply by changing their minds.In truth, Badenoch’s leadership is in a sort of twilight zone. Whatever glow surrounded her early days as leader has long since faded, dimmed by the slide in the polls that began immediately upon the conclusion of last year’s leadership contest and extinguished completely by the rout at the local elections in May.A good party conference in Manchester has done little to change this trajectory. It certainly staved off any immediate panic, but it didn’t tell the Tories anything they didn’t know already – to wit, that Badenoch can use the spotlight to good effect when events point it at her.The much more important question was whether she had the ability or the appetite to win the spotlight in the modern media’s fiercely competitive attention economy, and this she has so far failed to do. A year ago, this looked like a basic misjudgment – that the party could afford to take its time with five years until the next election – but nor has she been able to pick up any momentum from conference, with the Tories falling back off the media’s radar during October.All of this is reflectedin the polls, which tell a story that would make life difficult for any leader. After last year’s general election the Conservatives gained on Labour until November, then went into an immediate slide. Reform UK overtook the Tories’ average polling in January, and a couple of months later there was a much sharper collapse as Nigel Farage’s party picked up lots of Tory switchers.Badenoch has since stabilised her polling. But it has plateaued only at the same level at which the Conservativeslost two-thirdsof all the seats they were defending in the most recent local elections, and that is a full seven points down from the position she inherited last November.In light of all that, and the modern Tory party’s penchant for regicide, it is perhaps surprising that her leadership appears as stable as it does. But one by one, the buttresses that have propped it up are starting to crack.First, there was the perfectly fair argument that any new leader needed time to make their mark; her first anniversary probably signifies the expiry date of that one. Second was the concern that the party really needed to stop disposing of leaders quite so quickly. But it is far less momentous to replace a leader of the opposition than a prime minister, and this concern is likewise losing its potency.Perhaps the most important one remaining, at least for the critical MPs who make up the swing votes, is the want of an alternative. Badenoch secured the leadership in part by adroitly positioning herself to MPs as “not Robert Jenrick”, and to those MPs that remains the core of her appeal.But even that is losing its force. The problem is that while “not Robert Jenrick” was a majority proposition, it was also a fundamentally negative one. By sticking to bromides about Tory “values” and refusing to offer her own diagnosis of what went wrong between 2010 and 2024, Badenoch assembled a coalition that doesn’t agree on anything.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But neither they nor she has an alternative case to make. What was once said of the Labour right in the 1970s is equally true of today’s Tory centrists: “They had principles, and they had preferences, but they had no ideas.”Unhappily for Badenoch, the main buttress to her leadership today is the looming shadow of next year’s local elections. On current polling they would be just as brutal as this year’s, and risk gutting the party’s representation not just in another swath of English local government, but in the Scottish and Welsh parliaments too.The basic political calculation of the overwhelming majority of those Conservatives who have despaired of her leadership is simple: that it is better for them if Badenoch owns those elections.

At a grassroots level, amidplungingpoll ratings, there has been a yearning for renewal and a more punchy, combative approach in opposition. Against that bleak backdrop, the remarkableelectionof Zohran Mamdani to the New York City mayoralty is a moment for progressives to savour.Mr Mamdani entered the mayoral race last October as a socialist outsider with almost zero name recognition. He won it with more than 50% of the vote after the highest turnout in more than half a century, and despite the best efforts ofbillionairesto bankroll his chief rival, the former New York governor Andrew Cuomo, to victory. That achievement makes him the youngest mayor of the US’s largest city for more than 100 years and the first Muslim to occupy the role.New York is a traditional Democratic stronghold and is in no sense a national bellwether. Nevertheless, faced with a Maga movement that has based its success on the support of working-class voters, the Democratic party can learn much from Mr Mamdani’s extraordinary triumph. Leaving culture-war politics to his increasinglydesperateopponents, he campaigned relentlessly and almost exclusively on the theme of affordability.Charges of ideological extremism failed to stick becausepledgesof free childcare, free buses and a rent freeze spoke to an essentially social democratic message, offering public solutions to years of rising inequality. That vision persuaded a vast army of 100,000 volunteer canvassers to knock on millions of doors, more than offsetting Mr Cuomo’s far greater financial resources. The central insight was that values-driven opposition to Maga populism can succeed when supplemented by a positive offer to voters whose living standards have been steadily eroded.On an uplifting night for Democrats, a similar pattern was seen in New Jersey and Virginia, where more centrist-leaning candidateswongubernatorial races by impressive margins. Cost-of-living pledges were again to the fore, including a proposed freeze on electricity prices and a focus on housing costs. California offered further grounds for a cautious rebirth of optimism; after Republican gerrymandering of congressional boundaries in Texas, voters backed countermeasures to redress the balance ahead of next year’s midterm elections.As the Democratic party journeys through the wilderness of a second Trump term, it would be fanciful to believe that a corner has been definitively turned. For New York’s mayor-elect, the hard yards are yet to begin. Mr Trump has alreadythreatenedto withhold federal funds from an administration he will do his utmost to discredit, undermine and disrupt. More broadly, the reluctance of senior Democratic figures to endorse Mr Mamdani’s campaign confirms that internal divisions over strategy are a long way from being resolved.However, it would be churlish to ignore green shoots of political recovery when they appear. As Mr Trump’s popularitysinksamid ongoing cost-of-living concerns and high inflation, the hollowness of Maga pledges to improve blue-collar living standards is a major zone of vulnerability. An emerging focus on affordability anchors Democrats in the preoccupations of their lost voters, as well as those who have remained loyal. By campaigning on that basis with elan and conviction, Mr Mamdani has blazed an inspiring trail.Explore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniOpinionDemocratsUS politicsAndrew CuomoDonald TrumpNew YorkeditorialsShareReuse this content"

For example, modernisation will always be denounced as a dilution of standards. Inevitably, Conservatives have leapt on recommendations by an independent review, commissioned by the government, as proof that Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, is “dumbing down” the curriculum.The basis of these charges is that thereview, led by Becky Francis, professor of education at University College London, proposes reducing the burden of GCSE exams and scrapping the English baccalaureate – a cluster of subjects that, when taken together, constitute a metric of success recognised in school league tables. Conservatives are also unhappy about the notion that primary schoolchildren should learn about the climate crisis and be encouraged to value diversity.That is a selective reading of awide-ranging reviewthat calls for a more rigorous science curriculum and new tests to catch children whose progress slips between primary school and GCSE. Opposition attacks are premature when the government has not yet drafted any legislation.A unifying theme of the review is that the current system prioritises narrow metrics of attainment at the expense of other qualities. Room needs to be made for the acquisition of practical life skills, such as managing personal finances and distinguishing trustworthy information from fake news. Creativity and resilience are also vital for young people to flourish and find employment. Every parent who has seen a child’s love of writing stripped away by Gradgrindian primary school grammar tests will welcome a return to valuing imagination.Giving teachers more autonomy, as the review recommends, might also ease thecrisis in retention, although deeper problems there are stagnant pay, pupil behaviour and pressure on staff to double as social workers when other services are withdrawn.As for easing the burden that GCSE exams put on 16-year-olds, that should be uncontroversial. It is unusual byinternational standardsto pile so much assessment on young shoulders in such a short period. The volume and intensity of GCSEs demand mechanistic teaching to the test at the expense of more rewarding and inspiring methods.An emphasis on “enrichment” does not have to mean lowering expectations, although it raises reasonable questions about how better to measure and compare different schools’ performance – a necessary device for upholding standards. This is part of a wider challenge posed by the tidal wave oftechnological changesweeping through society.In an age where artificial intelligence can instantly generate plausible-looking essays on almost any topic, how will independent study and critical analytical skills be tested? How are modern languages to be taught, and with what application in mind, in a world of translation software? What will distinguish human capability in a labour market saturated with smart machines?It is unreasonable to expect any curriculum review to resolve such epoch-defining educational conundrums. But Prof Francis’s work does at least reckon with the reality of a world that is changing at bewildering speed, and the need to consider how schools might equip children to cope. It is not the government but the opposition that is dumbing down, by refusing to engage meaningfully with that challenge.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Your recent article (Britain one of least ‘nature-connected’ nations in world – with Nepal the most, 1 November) also shows that, despite our high levels of environmental membership, the UK remains one of the least nature-connected societies.When I first visited the UK in the early 1970s as a child, I was enchanted by the countryside and London’s parks. I absorbed BBC nature programmes, marvelled at the AA Book of the British Countryside and thought Britain was a land where nature thrived. Forty years later, returning as an ecologist, I realised the reality: it’s one of the most nature-depleted countries on Earth, with around 98% of native woodland lost.After 12 years of working in conservation here, I see what I call “the good chaps theory of conservation” at play. Borrowing from Peter Hennessy’s “good chaps theory of government”, it assumes those in charge will act honourably without scrutiny. In conservation, this means relying on goodwill rather than accountability.Britain has excellent environmental laws, but not a coherent protected-areas system. We need large, connected landscapes managed for ecological integrity and open for everyone to enjoy, not just small, fragmented enclaves for the few. Bridging the gap between our self-image as a green and pleasant land and our ecological reality begins with facing that truth and implementing a truly connected system of protected areas.Dr Marcelo LimaGirton, CambridgeshireI was surprised to read that Britain is among the world’s least “nature connected” nations. Since moving here three years ago, I’ve found the opposite to be true. I’ve walked the Pilgrims’ Way from Southwark to Canterbury, traced the River Ravensbourne from a spring in Keston to Deptford Creek, and followed the Thames Path from the source to Reading. Everywhere, nature is still present: in ancient hedgerows, forgotten footpaths and rivers that refuse to stay hidden.If people here feel cut off from nature, perhaps they’ve just stopped noticing it. The countryside hasn’t gone anywhere, it’s waiting to be rediscovered.Elia KabanovDeptford, LondonExplore more on these topicsBiodiversityConservationWildlifeAccess to green spaceParks and green spaceslettersShareReuse this content"

As a physician and academic who has worked in this area for 40 years, I would like to raise three underlying issues.First, it implies that hospices are the only model for delivering good end-of-life care. It is arguable that in Britain we have overrelied on the charitable sector. We now have NHS-funded hospital palliative care teams who can provide excellent care when patients are coming to the end of life but still needing specialist treatments – which very often hospices cannot or will not offer.In my evidencelast week to the House of Lords select committee on the terminally ill adults bill, I pointed out that patients on average are referred to end-of-life services such as hospices only in the last weeks of life. And about 80% of these have cancer – other conditions causing death with equal amounts of suffering are hardly catered for.Second, increased funding for end-of-life care is likely to support the same imbalanced model, with its geographical and socioeconomic inequalities. It is easier to talk of more money than of fundamentally reviewing service models.Third, your editorial restates the fallacy of assisted dying being a competitor for funding against the hospice sector. There is ample evidence that in jurisdictions with legalised assisted dying, palliative care and assisted dying can exist side by side. Indeed, introducing assisted dying has often led to an increase in palliative care funding and referrals.The truth is that end-of-life care has failed to evolve in the 60 years since the opening of the first modern hospice and in the 40 years since we have had specialist palliative medicine. It could take for ever for hospice-based end-of-life care to achieve the funding it wants. And for ever is something that dying people do not have.ProfSam H AhmedzaiEmeritus professor ofpalliative medicine, University of SheffieldYour editorial is absolutely right to urge greater commitment to palliative care services; my own specialty here in the Australian state of Victoria for 20 years. However, it misses a vital point: assisted dying is a complement to such care, not a competitor. (Subsequent letters (2 November) from leaders in the sector fail to mention assisted dying at all; somewhat surprising given the high-profile debate the UK is currently engaged in.)In Victoria, where voluntary assisted dying (VAD) has been available since 2019, I have supported more than 70 patients through the process. Every one of them received expert palliative care. Most wanted simply to know that, if their suffering became intolerable, they had another lawful option. They did not reject palliative care; they valued it deeply. But for a small number, it could not completely meet their needs in the final days.Experience here has shown that introducing VAD has strengthened, not weakened, our care culture. About 80–85% of people who use VAD are already in receipt of palliative care, and governments have responded with more than A$1bn (£500m) in new palliative-care investment since 2017. My specialty, historically sceptical of assisted dying, has experienced a significant shift in favour, at last recognising what our patients had long been telling us: palliative care and choice go hand in hand.Dr Greg MewettPalliative care physician, Ballarat Central, Victoria, AustraliaHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Whatever you’re doing right now, 31 October).It has been an uphill struggle. It is rare for student councils to be given the opportunity to discuss anything consequential about school issues or their own learning.Parent councils – different from parent-teacher associations, which are mostly about fundraising – often struggle to attract parents. Parents generally want to talk about their own children, but are less keen to get involved in discussions about school policies. And school leaders seem reluctant to encourage the setting up of staff councils, worried about unleashing the voices of teachers, many of whom might have a lot to say about working conditions and an overloaded curriculum.Of course, governing bodies exist, but it is a rare occurrence to see them genuinely consulting with any of these three constituencies.As a consequence, schools in England are deeply undemocratic institutions where students, parents, carers and staff are done “to” rather than “with”. Until this changes and those with a stake in schools are involved in decision-making on issues that affect them, I hold out little hope that young people will leave school with an understanding of why democracy matters.Fiona CarnieEducationist and writer, BathHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Plus letters fromSimon Gibbs, Helen ElliottandTristram BurdenWed 5 Nov 2025 12.33 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 14.48 ESTShareAs the chair of governors at a large secondary school in a deprived area, I’m glad that there’s a push to close the literacy gap. But most of the debate gets lost in headline battles with unions over compulsory age-13 tests instead of focusing on why so many children show up in year 7 without the reading skills they need (Bridget Phillipson ‘ready to take on unions’ over year 8 reading tests, 1 November).Our pupils already go through national assessments in primary school. When they transfer, we run our own screening, and more than half start secondary school already behind. Adding another test at 13 won’t fix that. All it does is pull staff away from the real work: teaching children to read, which is already time-consuming and demanding.Do you know what actually helps? Investment and working together, not more conflict. Ministers need to back long-term, evidence-based transition programmes between primary and secondary schools. Secondary teachers deserve high-quality training in literacy instruction. We need more reading specialists and librarians, libraries filled with books that reflect our students’ lives, and protected time in which to read for pleasure.Any new assessment should be diagnostic and formative – something that guides support rather than just another tick-box for accountability. Most importantly, the government must commit to stable funding for interventions that build reading skills from the first day of secondary school, and earlier if necessary.Teachers, governors and unions all want the same thing: every child able to read well and access the curriculum. Instead of wasting months on arguments about testing, ministers should bring everyone together to design and fund real solutions to solve the problem, not just add another test that drains the time and energy needed to fix it.Michael RobinsonGosport, HampshireAs there is justifiable concern about the development of some groups of children, there may be merit in providing activities to enhance their interest in education. But the education secretary would be wise to pay heed to the old adage that “weighing the pig does not make it fatter”. Reading tests for all 13-year-olds are unlikely to do anything to address the literacy skills of those from poor backgrounds. Indeed, further tests may further disenfranchise those already let down by what passes for education in schools. The numbers of children who fail the test may also add to the already overburdened special educational needs system.Instead, it’s worth ensuring that all schools have attractive and well-stocked libraries where young people can be helped to find material that resonates with and enriches their interests, thereby stimulating a thirst for learning.Simon GibbsEmeritus professor of inclusive educational psychology and philosophy, Newcastle UniversityPerhaps Bridget Phillipson should publish the research which informs her that increased testing produces better outcomes. Has she taken into account the improvement that occurs from raising self-esteem and confidence in young people? These essential skills for developing learning are encouraged by a curriculum that is rich in creativity, exploration and enjoyment. Perhaps she could consider the wealth of research in this pedagogy rather than succumbing to the “test, test, test” philosophy.Helen ElliottRetired deputy head, Taunton, SomersetReading that Bridget Phillipson wants to abolish the two-child benefit cap was very welcome news that altered the otherwise bitter taste of reading the rest of this latest policy announcement.If she really wants to make an impact on children’s lives, she should restore Sure Start funding to 2010 levels and leave schools to be schools. Burdening school heads and children with even more responsibilities and requirements will not have the outcomes she intends. We know Sure Start works. And Labour introducing new centres, under its rebrand as Best Start, deserves more fanfare than it’s getting. But we also need the social infrastructure that used to be supported by local government funding.We need our libraries to stay open and for longer. We need to reopen our youth clubs and increase the availability of spaces for children and younger people to foster a sense of belonging, exchange ideas and encounter each other outside the confines, algorithms and latent toxicity of digital life. Expecting schools to take the place of what used to be socially available opportunities before austerity is a waste of their energy and resources.Children don’t feel they belong because there is nowhere for them to belong, and schools are the last place that should be expected to take on the extra responsibility of fostering belonging.Schoolsare doing plenty. They teach. Let them teach, and let local authorities develop the spaces for social belonging that they desperately want to, but find they can no longer afford to.Tristram BurdenBrighton, East SussexHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

This was reiterated by his two-goal show that helped to sweep Pep Guardiola’s improving team to 10 points from four games at the league stage’s halfway juncture.Factor in Erling Haaland, who decorated his captaincy for the night with a 27th goal (for club and country), and Waldemar Anton’s 72nd-minute jab home was solely an irritation.Pep Guardiola urges Manchester City’s Phil Foden to push for England recallRead moreBut after the strikeBorussia Dortmundhad more moments – Karim Adeyemi missed at point-blank range – and so despite Rayan Cherki’s fourth in added time, Guardiola is sure to remind his players to disallow the opponent from wresting the initiative as the visitors did for the closing phases.The bottom line, though, is that City are close to the cohesive proposition that makes them formidable. The ceiling is again high for the 2022‑23 treble winners – just where Guardiola would want the side before Liverpool’s visit on Sunday.Guardiola trained the squad on Wednesday morning, preferring to give players Tuesday off after their “so demanding”3-1 win against Bournemouthhere on Sunday. This rare move – “I’ve done it a few times” – caused the eye to look for any discernible impact on their rhythm seven or so hours after being put through the drills.By half-time, the answer was a definite no. Dortmund initially monopolised the ball, pinned their hosts back and a loose Josko Gvardiol pass allowed Adeyemi to be played through along the right and momentarily threaten Gianluigi Donnarumma’s goal. Adeyemi was soon breaking again along the same flank and zipping in a ball from which Maximilian Beier failed to prosper.Before this, a City foray had Foden crossing, the Dortmund goalkeeper Gregor Kobel repelling, and a throw-in being claimed. In this same sequence, Savinho fed Foden who powered a shot that Kobel parried downwards, then the in-rushing Brazilian blazed high.As against Bournemouth on Sunday, City were in breakaway rather than percussive passing mode. Savinho zipped over from his wing and caused Daniel Svensson to scythe him down but Foden’s free-kick pitter-pattered into Kobel’s gloves.This proved a sighter for City’s playmaker, and on receiving his next opportunity he scored – a goal that derived from classic Guardiola passing play. Camped in Dortmund territory, Nico González located Tijjani Reijnders in an inside-right zone. He pinged the ball to Foden and with a swish of his left foot Kobel was beaten with a calmly rolled finish.View image in fullscreenPhil Foden fires Manchester City ahead.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/ReutersIt was a “floodgates open” moment because City soon added a second. Savinho’s run and shot was palmed away by the overworked Kobel before Jérémy Doku collected on the left and skimmed the ball back in, along the turf, and Haaland smashed home.Pan left then, to a Guardiola whose joy was soon replaced by irritation caused by the latest detail of imperfection from his unit. It was a mystery really, because Kobel was soon tested again by a Reijnders hit, then Haaland marauded and offered up a rare treat: the sight of him turned winger, floating over a delivery from which Nico O’Reilly missed hitting home City’s third.Perhaps Guardiola’s ire was vented to prevent slackening off: if so he was horrified to witness his defence slumber with Adeyemi lurking under a high ball that Donnarumma chose to punch out rather than catch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In four previous meetings with City (all Champions League), Dortmund had won only once – 1-0 in a December 2012 group game – and when the second half began they were far away from a repeat.Savinho nearly killed all hope with a snap-shot Kobel again had to repel. Then Gvardiol dropped the ball into Dortmund’s danger area and they cleared their ranks.This time last year City struggled for consistency and solidity: keywords in the Guardiola manifesto. Here, as against Bournemouth and on more matchdays than not during this season, each were present.When González and O’Reilly played keep-ball at halfway, Niko Kovac’s side were a quasi-circular yellow wall. Seconds later, City, in their hypnotic fashion, had Savinho running by Dortmund’s six-yard box and forcing a corner: a diagram of how Guardiola’s side have dismantled so many foes.View image in fullscreenErling Haaland smashes the ball home for Manchester City’s second goal.Photograph: Nick Potts/PASo, too, was Foden’s second goal. Doku tapped to González who tapped to Reijnders. The pass went to the Stockport Iniesta who swivelled and again beat Kobel from long range: sheer class.City were in playful mood. A Doku pass was backheeled to Haaland who returned the ball and, when it came curving over, Savinho might have volleyed the sweetest of finishes but blasted over.Beforehand, Guardiola delivered an update on Rodri: “It [his hamstring issue] doesn’t feel perfect – he will not be out for a while.” When the No 16 does return, City will be even better.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueManchester CityBorussia DortmundEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They have won six of their past eight games, which might sound like an impressive run of form, but their defeat at West Ham on Sunday was wretched enough to raise all manner of doubts. Three successiveChampions Leaguewins, though, all without conceding, means they probably need only one more victory from their final four games to secure a place in the playoff round, while two wins and a draw would almost certainly secure a top‑eight place and automatic passage to the last 16.This Newcastle are a team with an extremely high ceiling and a very low floor. They are capable of hammering Union Saint-Gilloise and pummelling Benfica in the Champions League and outplaying Tottenham in the Carabao Cup. But they are also capable of losing 3-1 against West Ham and being grateful it wasn’t worse. They are both the amiable doctor and the vicious criminal, both ferociously energetic winners and lethargic disappointments, both Jekyll and Hyde.Manchester City v Dortmund, Newcastle v Athletic, and more: Champions League – liveRead more“We navigated today really well after the weekend,” Eddie Howe said. “It was important we responded mentally. Our psychology was really good. We’ve had three wins in a row, some good performances and we’re in a good position.”The huge advantage Newcastle have in Europe is that they are bigger than most of their opponents. That has been an ongoing feature of the Champions League this season: Premier League sides have a huge physical advantage over their rivals. Compounding that was Athletic’s baffling reluctance to pick up the biggest bloke in the box every time Newcastle attacked.David Copperfield once made the Statue of Liberty disappear, but even he might baulk at the challenge of making Dan Burn invisible, yet that was what Newcastle achieved as they took the lead after 11 minutes.The Premier League focus on set plays appears to have given them a huge advantage in Europe. Just as Liverpool plagued Real Madrid from corners and free-kicks on Tuesday, so Newcastle tormented Athletic. As Keiran Trippier whipped the ball in from the right, Burn somehow looped unseen round the back of the defence to steer a glorious header inside the far post. “It was a well-worked routine,” Howe said, “a really good ball in. We need to score more from set plays.”Howe also paid tribute to Trippier’s attitude in getting himself back to fitness after illness, and acknowledged Newcastle have missed him.View image in fullscreenDan Burn gave Newcastle an early lead with a fine long-range header from a free-kick.Photograph: Ryan Browne/ProSports/ShutterstockThe Athletic head coach, Ernesto Valverde, said: “I have a bitter taste in my mouth. It was a shame. In the first half they punished us with a free‑kick. It was almost telegraphed, we should have known. It was an obvious move and we fell for it.”Unai Gómez was denied at the near post by the outstretched foot of Nick Pope, and Adama Boiro pinged a snap‑shot off the woodwork but there was always a sense that those chances came against the run of play and that Newcastle’s superior physicality would prevail. In the end they were helped by further poor marking from Athletic, Joelinton left untended six yards out to nod in a Harvey Barnes cross four minutes into the second half.Howe made a triple substitution soon after, an understandable move given the pressure of the calendar. Newcastle lost momentum but they were never anything other than comfortable and for most of the last half‑hour the game was largely an exercise in running down the clock.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Beating Benfica and Athletic at home was vital for Newcastle’s hopes of progression. “These home games were really important,’ Howe said, “and that put an added pressure on us.”The inconsistency is clearly beginning to niggle. “We want to make sure we don’t become that team that’s yoyoing in terms of attitude and intensity,” Howe said, rejecting the idea that his side are becoming a cup team. “I know the players are frustrated, so I don’t think it’s from a lack of effort. If you’re just able to lift yourself for certain moments you never know when that negative side’s going to raise itself.”Brentford away at the weekend will be a very different test – and then comes the relief of the international break and a chance for at least some of the squad to recuperate.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueNewcastle UnitedAthletic BilbaoEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Chaos tends to set in whenever the Italian tries to freshen things up by making use of a deep but raw squad and he is unlikely to be in a rush to rotate again in theChampions Leagueafter seeing a weakened team fail to douse Qarabag’s skill and spirit on a raucous night in Baku.There was no doubt Qarabag were the happier team at the conclusion of this absorbing 2-2 draw.Chelsea, by contrast, were merely grateful that their 5,000-mile round trip to Azerbaijan had not ended in major embarrassment. Not once were they were in control against defiant opposition, even after going ahead through the outstanding Estêvão Willian, and it was hardly ideal that Maresca had to make three changes when his players went down the tunnel with their egos bruised and damage to repair after a shambolic first half.Manchester City v Dortmund, Newcastle v Athletic, and more: Champions League – liveRead moreThrowing on Enzo Fernández, Liam Delap and Alejandro Garnacho so soon was not part of the plan, and it is unlikely that João Pedro staying on for 71 minutes was either. Yet while Chelsea wanted to rest weary limbs their level dips when the understudies come in. Jorrel Hato endured a nightmare in central defence and Maresca was ruthless in removing Andrey Santos, Jamie Gittens and Tyrique George at half-time.He had already lost Roméo Lavia to an early injury, ending hopes of giving Moisés Caicedo the night off in midfield. Chelsea felt the pain. Garnacho rescued a point but a draw leaves their hopes of finishing in the top eight of the league phase in doubt.Chelsea, level withQarabagafter taking seven points from four games, know that tougher tests await. Barcelona visit Stamford Bridge next month. Trips to Atalanta and Napoli pose further complications.Qarabag have made huge strides under their long-serving coach, Gurban Gurbanov. Their quick, adventurous football was a joy to watch and almost made Maresca rue his decision to manage a draining schedule by making seven changes.An upset beckoned. Qarabag were fearless and it was not easy for Chelsea given the noise pouring down from the stands, where the sight of some home fans standing in the aisles added to the air of unruliness.It was mayhem. A starting lineup with an average age of 23 years and 97 days saw Chelsea field the second youngest side by an English club in a Champions League away game. Inexperience explains why the understudies struggle to maintain concentration. It was a similar story when they almost blew a 3-0 leadagainst Wolves last week.View image in fullscreenEstêvão opens the scoring for Chelsea in the first half.Photograph: APMaresca needs to be able to trust them more. He does not want to keep having to turn to Caicedo and Fernández but Dário Essugo is a long-term absentee and Lavia cannot stay fit. “The Club World Cup affected [us] a lot,” Maresca said, suggesting that Chelsea’s extended summer has affected them physically.Chelsea were already without Cole Palmer, Levi Colwill and Pedro Neto. They were uncertain even after bringing on Caicedo. Qarabag ripped forward and targeted the unfamiliar pairing of Hato and Tosin Adarabioyo, who did nothing to help his younger teammate.Hato’s struggles were tough to watch. The 19-year-old almost conceded an early penalty, was bullied by Camilo Durán in the buildup to Leandro Andrade’s equaliser and was at fault when Qarabag went ahead. “They are silly goals to concede,” Maresca acknowledged.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The prime minister, Keir Starmer, called it the “wrong” decision and the opposition leader, Kemi Badenoch, said it was a “national disgrace”.Maccabi announced in September that they would play all four homeEuropa Leaguegames this season in Belgrade. “It is very hard for us,” said Sissokho. “Every home game in Europe we play in Serbia, so it’s a big difference. We know the fans are very important for us. We have to think about them because they will watch the game on the TV. We have to give everything on the pitch to give them a smile and perform as a team. We have to concentrate on the team and play our game with this feeling.”Maccabi’s Serbian head coach, Zarko Lazetic, would not be drawn on whether the ban on away fans was “unfair”, which was how the decision was described by the club’s chief executive, Jack Angelides.View image in fullscreenMaccabi Tel Aviv’s Issouf Sissokho faces the media before the match.Photograph: Jacob King/PALazetic said: “Unfair or fair, in the world I am not one who judges about that but on the pitch it is 11 v 11 and we will try to do our best.” Asked if Maccabi’s squad had discussed the political backdrop, Lazetic confirmed they had but refused to elaborate, adding only: “We are only focusing on the football.”On Wednesday evening West Midlands police confirmed section 60 powers will be in place from midday on Thursday until 3am on Friday.Policehorses, police dogs and a drone unit will be in use.Ch Supt Tom Joyce said: “Our message to those from all communities in Birmingham is that we have listened and will continue to engage with you. We remain committed to maintaining the city’s reputation as a safe and welcoming place for everyone. Anyone who breaks the law will be dealt with directly, as will those who incite hate.”Schools in Birmingham are closing early on Thursday amid fears of unrest.

But they could finally have made a decision that makes senseOliver ConnollyWed 5 Nov 2025 07.49 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 08.01 ESTShareThe Jets embrace the tankIt’s rare to see a franchise accept what everyone else already knows – that what they’ve built isn’t working. The Jets didn’t just tweak their roster at the deadline; they detonated it. In a dizzying few hours, they dealt cornerback Sauce Gardner to the Colts and defensive lineman Quinnen Williams to the Cowboys.Moving two All-Pros at the deadline is unprecedented. No team has ever so clearly embracedtankingat the deadline. The Jets, for once, looked in the mirror and were honest. They decided they were not good enough, and shipped out as many stars as they could for a mountain of future draft picks. They are now loaded with picks in 2026and2027, the latter of which has a much stronger draft class.You can’t fault the logic. Even with Gardner blanketing half the field and Williams crushing pockets, the Jets were 1–7 this season. The defense wasn’t the main problem, but it’s fallen off a cliff under Aaron Glenn’s leadership. So they tore it down. Gardner and Williams net three future first-rounders and a second-rounder over the next two seasons, giving the Jets five first-round picks in 2026 and 2027 combined. It’s a war chest that could recalibrate the entire organization around the offense. They already have a talented, young offensive line, and they kept Garrett Wilson, a blue-chip wide receiver. With that kind of draft ammunition over multiple draft classes, they can identify whoever they believe is the next elite quarterback prospect and build out a stable group around them.The Chiefs-Bills rivalry is incapable of producing a bad gameRead moreIt’s easy to scoff at teams giving up All-Pro talent for draft picks, particularly a 25-year-old like Gardner.Draft picks are great! Who knows, you could even select a player as talented as Sauce Gardner!But it’s different for the Jets. They’re not operating on a playoff or championship timeline. They tried a quick-fix with Aaron Rodgers at quarterback,and it didn’t work. Now, they’re finally taking a long-term view. If that puts them two years away from playoff contention, then picking up three first-round picks for a volatile cornerback and a defensive lineman who will be 29 by 2027 is wise. The question, of course, is whether “wise” and “Jets” can coexist when Woody Johnson, whomakes a strong casefor the worst owner in US sports, is still in charge. The moves should at least confirm that Johnson will stick with head coach Glenn, who will now be able to mould the roster in his own image.Teams don’t typically throw seasons away, and the Jets haven’t made the playoffs since the 2010 season, the longest drought in the NFL. The record of tanking in the NFL is poor. This isn’t the NBA, where one player can transform the trajectory of a franchise, and the No 1 overall pick is the most valuable commodity in the sport. There are too many moving pieces in football for one player to be an NBA-like difference-maker. The Browns, Dolphins and Texans have all tried some variation of multi-year tanking, and all three have failed to different degrees (Houston being the most successful). Still, the Jets deserve credit for extracting maximum value out of two players while resetting their own timeline. They may lack a pair of playmakers for the final eight games of this season, but they’re set up to build a strong foundation over the next two seasons. If anything, they should have pushed further and traded Jermaine Johnson and Breece Hall before the deadline closed.Sorry, Breece.The Colts go all-inOn the flip side of one of the Jets’ mega-deals are the Colts. Indy gave up two first-round picks and absorbed Gardner’s $30m per-year deal to fix their one glaring hole: cornerback. After trying to patchwork the group together, GM Chris Ballard decided to go all-in, chasing the biggest name available at the deadline. At 25 years old, Gardner is the youngest ever multiple All-Pro to be traded midseason. Players of his caliber rarely, if ever, become available during their prime.The Colts paid a higher price because they believe they acquired a player who could help them win a Super Bowl this year, just as the Rams did in the past with Von Miller and Jalen Ramsey.But there are reasons why Gardner wasavailable in the first place, despite signing a contract extension with the Jets in the offseason. He’s taken a step back since his otherworldly rookie season. Cornerback is a notoriously volatile position, but even by those standards, Gardner’s last couple of seasons have been worrying. In press coverage, where he can plaster himself to a receiver one-on-one, he remains one of the best in the game. Everything else has been a mystery. Gardner has shown little interest in tackling in a league that is increasingly built around the run game. He has also been responsible for plenty of coverage breakdowns while the splash plays have dried up (he has one interception in the last two and a half seasons).The Colts are betting that in a stronger environment, the Gardner of his rookie season will return. That player can lock down one-half of the field and help raise their entire defense, even if he doesn’t offer top-tier playmaking on his own. Maybe they’re right. But betting two first-round picks on anideaof who a player could be rather than who he has shown to be over 18 months is one heck of a gamble.Trading two first-rounders also confirms that the Colts believe Daniel Jones is the long-term answer, too. Without the means to draft a quarterback in the first round, they’ll likely sign Jones to a long-term extension, somewhere in the vicinity of three years for $120m. Jones has been lights out over the first half of the season, but that’s a small sample size to bank the future of the franchise on.It may work out. But it feels like a classic move from a GM under pressure. Ballard has built good, not great, teams for half a decade. He is working with new owners this year. Gardner could be the piece that turns good into great, or the overreach that ends Ballard’s tenure.Trades often work. It’s another path to upgrading a roster. Too many teams fetishize draft picks, the Colts chief among them. Trading one first-rounder is all-in; it’s effectively getting a player now that you’d have drafted next spring. And when that player is a 25-year-old All-Pro, it’s a no-brainer. But moving two first-round picks when you don’t have a settled quarterback is a reach. And doing so when you have a GM fighting for his future based on a hot start against an easy-ish schedule is a questionable process.Jerry keeps his wordJerry Jones promised a deadline day splash. He delivered. The Cowboys traded real assets – a first- and second-round pick over the next two drafts – to get Williams, a high-level interior disruptor. Adding Williams gives the Cowboys one of the most gifted interior defensive lines in the league. It’s a desperate attempt to fix their historically lousy run defense. Add linebacker Logan Wilson, who was acquired from Cincinnati for a seventh-round pick, and Dallas suddenly have upgrades at two key positions. Wilson looked cooked with the Bengals, but he at least knows where to be, and that’s a luxury Dallas hasn’t had at linebacker this season.From dynasty to soap opera: how Jerry Jones traded Dallas Cowboys glory for ‘365 days of sizzle’Read moreOn paper, it’s coherent. In practice, it’s expensive. They have already invested the majority of the return they received for trading away Micah Parsons. With all the moves in the books, they essentially dealt Parsons to:Acquire WilliamsAcquire defensive tackle Kenny Clark from the PackersMove up from the second to the first round in the 2026 draft, roughly 20 spotsSave $70m in salary cap spaceIs that a deal you would make? Parsons is a unique, dominant force at a premium position, still in his prime. Williams is excellent, but not on Parsons’ level. Clark may not even be on the roster next season. The Cowboys can gain an additional $20m in cap room if they release him this offseason.The Cowboys’ defense may be better this season, sure. But this is less about long-term planning than the emotional volatility of Jones. It still feels like Jones – and by default the Cowboys – are making it up as they go along. Each move makes sense on its own. But step back and bundle them together, and Dallas traded away one of the best players in the league for an excellent player nearing the end of his prime and some cap flexibility.The defending champs load upYes,Howie Roseman did it again. It’s become a ritual for the Eagles GM to move cheap, future draft picks to load up on talent for a potential title run. This year, he shopped in the luxury aisle, acquiring edge-rusher Jaelan Phillips from the Dolphins for a third-round pick.View image in fullscreenHas Howie Roseman built another championship winning team?Photograph: David J Phillip/APPhillips was always a logical target for the Eagles. They need more edge-rushing juice, with Nolan Smith dealing with an injury and Za’Darius Smith abruptly retiring. They were able to lure Brandon Graham out of retirement, but even with his return, they still lack serious sizzle off the edge. Phillips will give them some needed oomph. The move reunites Phillips with his former defensive coordinator, Vic Fangio, who extracted the most out of Phillips during their season working together before the player tore his achilles.Phillips is one of the most technically astute edge-defenders in the league. But he’s lost a step after atorrent of injuries, including an ACL injury last year. There have been flashes of the old player in Miami this season. His pressure rate has rebounded to his career high, but he lacks the explosiveness he once had to finish plays. He’s also winced when taking on blockers in the run game.In Philly, that shouldn’t matter as much. He will be a pass-rush specialist who should thrive on a pitch count.A third-rounder may have been an overpay for a player with such an extensive injury record who is a six-month rental. But the Eagles are operating on a different timeline. They have a chance to win back-to-back Super Bowls and had a spare third-round pick to play with. Among the edge-rushers on the market, Phillips was the best available for a reasonable price. If he makes a handful of plays in the playoffs, overpaying will be irrelevant. Phillips is only 26, and the Eagles could also extend him in the offseason.Phillips was not the only upgrade Roseman made before the deadline. The Eagles also added cornerbacks Michael Carter II and Jaire Alexander for a pair of late-round picks. Alexander, a two-time All-Pro, is a shadow of his former self, but Carter could prove to be a valuable pick-up down the stretch. He offers inside-outside flexibility and will allow Fangio to move Cooper DeJean around the defense based on the matchup. Snagging Phillips and Carter should help plug leaky parts of the defense – and Alexander is a worthwhile, low-risk flier.Seattle lands deal of the dayThe Cowboys and Colts may have made more seismic deals, but none could prove to be as impactful as the Seahawks’ picking up Rashid Shaheed. Seattle landed the receiver from the Saints for a fourth- and fifth-round pick.Shaheed is one of the league’s most dynamic deep threats, averaging over 17 yards a catch during his career. The Seahawks already lead the league in every deep passing metric, but Shaheed adds another jolt of electricity. The threat of Shaheed rolling deep will help the Seahawks complete their offensive jigsaw, opening up the intermediate part of the field and aiding a faltering run game. If defenses are fearful of deep bombs, they’ll back and give more space for the run game to hum underneath.The Seahawks have a Super Bowl-caliber roster. Their defense is the most flexible in the league, and is packed with playmakers at every level. Sam Darnold is playing at an MVP level. With another deep threat, Darnold and the passing game can maintain their explosiveness while improving their down-to-down consistency.The NFC is so deep that it’s tough to pick a favorite. Seattle are still scrapping to win the NFC West. But with Shaheed on board, the Seahawks roster is rounding into being the most complete in the conference.Explore more on these topicsNFLNew York JetsDallas CowboysIndianapolis ColtsPhiladelphia EaglesSeattle SeahawksUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It galvanised us and it really put our arms around each other.”While the USA captain, Keegan Bradley,declined to condemnthe “passionate” New York fans, McIlroy said the experience ultimately strengthened the European team’s resolve en route to their narrow victory.Preparing now for the season-ending DP World Tour Championship in Dubai, the five-time major winner reflected on what he called a career‑defining campaign. “I think back to the start in January of 2025 when I was last here and everything that’s happened since,” McIlroy said. “Honestly, in my wildest dreams, I didn’t know. I mean, I knew a year like this was possible, but it has just been an amazing 10 months.”McIlroy also weighed in on LIV Golf’sdecision to expand to 72-hole eventsbeginning in 2026, a change widely seen as a bid for official world ranking points. “I think it’s a peculiar move because I think they could have got ranking points with three rounds. I don’t think three rounds versus four rounds is what was holding them back.“It certainly puts them more in line with traditional golf tournaments … but if that’s what they felt they needed to do to get the ranking points, I guess that’s what they had to do.”Yet McIlroy doubts the switch will significantly boost LIV players’ standings. “Say potentially they get world rankings points, but because their strength of fields are going to be so weak because a lot of the guys have fallen already in the rankings … I don’t know if the ranking points are really going to benefit them. It will be interesting to see how it plays out.”Explore more on these topicsRory McIlroyRyder Cup 2025Ryder CupPGA TourLIV Golf SeriesGolfnewsShareReuse this content"

It also includes co-chairs Maria Torres-Springer, the former first deputy mayor; Lina Khan, the former federal trade commission chair; the United Way’s president and CEO, Grace Bonilla; and the former deputy mayor for health and human services Melanie Hartzog.“In the coming months, I and my team will build a city hall capable of delivering on the promises of this campaign,” Mamdani told reporters. “We will form an administration that is equal parts capable and compassionate, driven by integrity and willing to work just as hard as the millions of New Yorkers who call this city home.”New York parties for Zohran Mamdani: ‘The first time we’ve had hope in so long’Read moreThe selection of Khan, who gained national prominence for her aggressive antitrust enforcement at the FTC under Joe Biden and is admired by both progressives and populist Republicans, signals Mamdani’s intention to bring bold reformers into his administration as he prepares to lead the nation’s largest city.In his first television interview since defeating Andrew Cuomo, the former governor, and Republican Curtis Sliwa on Tuesday night, Mamdani stressed the urgency of preparation. “We owe it to this city to be ready on 1 January to start delivering,” he said on Wednesday. “We have 57 days and those are 57 days to start to do the work of preparing.”With his victory, Mamdani will become the city’s first Muslim mayor, the first of South Asian heritage, the first born in Africa and theyoungestin more than a century.New York’s incoming administration faces formidable obstacles, not least from Donald Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to withhold federal funding from the city if Mamdani took office. In a post on his Truth Social platform, the president, who also hails from Queens, wrote that if Mamdani won the mayoral election, “it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required” to New York City. He often labels the democratic socialist a “communist”.New York City’s budget for fiscal year 2026 includes approximately $7.4bn in federal funding, accounting for 6.4% of total spending, according toa 2025 analysisfrom the state comptroller.On election day, Trump escalated his attacks, writing on Truth Social that “any Jewish person that votes forZohran Mamdani, a proven and self professed JEW HATER, is a stupid person”, despite Mamdani’s repeated condemnations of antisemitism.Democrats celebrate while Republicans stew over Mamdani’s historic win and othersRead moreThe campaign was marked by a massive wave of Islamophobic attacks from Democrats, Republicans and conservative commentators. Florida congressman Randy Fine and Tennessee congressman Andy Ogles, both Republicans, urged the justice department todenaturalize and deportMamdani, who became a US citizen in 2018, and in late October, Cuomo laughed on a radio show when host Sid Rosenberg suggested that Mamdani “would be cheering” if another 9/11 attack occurred, with Cuomo responding in agreement. Later, standing next to outgoing mayor Eric Adams, Cuomo noddedas Adams warned: “New York can’t be Europe, folks. You see what’s playing out in other countries because of Islamic extremism.”Republican congressman Chip Roy of Texas alsopublished an op-edahead of the election warning about the “Islamic cultural revolution” behind Mamdani, calling him “the poster child for the modern Democrat party”.ANovember reportfrom the Center for the Study of Organized Hate found that Islamophobic posts about Mamdani on X increased by more than 450% from September to October, with nearly 36,000 posts from over 17,000 unique accounts collectively receiving 7.37m likes, and 72% of posts involved “terrorist labeling”.The mayor-elect acknowledged some of the significant challenges ahead, including navigating city hall bureaucracy and working under a hostile Trump administration. But Mamdani said he’s convinced in his ability to deliver on his campaign promises.“I’m confident in delivering these same policies that we ran on for the last year,” he said, adding that he aims to unite New Yorkers across political divides. “No matter what your politics, we’re all facing the same issues.”Mamdani campaigned on an unapologetically progressive platform including a rent freeze for stabilized apartments, free bus service, universal childcare and city-run grocery stores, all funded by increased taxes on corporations and the wealthy. His campaign raised more than $20m from small donors, breaking fundraising records with an average contribution of approximately $80.His victory also came on a night of scorching wins for Democrats nationally. In gubernatorial races, Democrats Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger won in New Jersey and Virginia, respectively, both as former moderate Democratic members of Congress running on their national security backgrounds.California voters also approved Proposition 50, Gavin Newsom’s redistricting measure designed to make five Republican-held congressional seats more favorable to Democrats in next year’s midterm elections. And in Somerville, Massachusetts – home to Tufts University – votersapproved Question 3, a non-binding measure calling on city leaders to end business with companies that “engage in business that sustains Israel’s apartheid, genocide and illegal occupation of Palestine”, by 55%.The incoming New York administration said it would begin announcing deputy mayors and agency commissioners in the coming days. Mamdani said that “some of these people will have familiar names, others will not” but that these officials would be united by their “commitment to solving old problems with new solutions”.“On 1 January, when our city celebrates the inauguration of a new administration, let us also celebrate a new era for our city,” Mamdani said, “one that we all feel invested in and whose success we all work to achieve.”Explore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniNew YorkUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He faces charges of organised theft and criminal conspiracy.A court in Bobigny, north of Paris, on Wednesday postponed his trial in a separate case in which he is accused of damaging public property, saying the conditions for a “serene” hearing could not be met due to “media attention and recent events”.Louvre jewel heist by petty criminals, not organised professionals, says Paris prosecutorRead moreMaxime Cavaillé, one of the lawyers representing the suspect, said his defence would be “extremely vigilant” about “respect of the presumption of innocence” and aim to protect their client’s rights and privacy despite the extraordinary nature of the Louvre case.Four suspects are in custody in relation to the theft, including three thought to have been members of the four-man gang who used a stolen truck with an extendable ladder and freight lift to reach the first-floor window of the museum’s Apollo gallery.Two of the gang smashed an unsecured window and two glass display cases before descending in the lift and fleeing on motorbikes driven by the other two, in a brazen daylight heist that lasted less than seven minutes from start to finish.They fled with eight pieces, including an emerald and diamond necklace that Napoleon I gave to his second wife, Marie Louise, and a diadem set with 212 pearls and nearly 2,000 diamonds that once belonged to the wife of Napoleon III.French media have reported that Abdoulaye N – whose DNA was reportedly found on one of the display cases and on items abandoned at the scene, which included gloves, a hi-vis vest and disc cutters – is suspected of being one of the pair who broke into the gallery.Le Parisien newspaperandBFMTVsaid the suspect was known on social media as Doudou Cross Bitume, a well-known neighbourhood figure who had released numerous videos on YouTube and, more recently, TikTok and Instagram.Some videos, with the sloganToujours plus près du bitume(Always closer to the tarmac), show him performing tricks on motorbikes in Paris and Aubervilliers, near the Stade deFrancesports stadium. Others offer muscle-building tips.In several of the videos, Doudou Cross Bitume is shown riding a Yamaha TMax, the particularly powerful make of mega-scooter used in the Louvre thieves’ getaway. Investigators working on the case have not yet recovered the stolen jewels.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Neighbours told the paper he was “helpful”, “decent” and a man “who wears his heart on his sleeve”.According to several French media outlets, Abdoulaye N’s criminal record features 15 offences, including: possession and transportation of drugs; driving without a licence; and causing danger to others. He was also convicted of robbing a jewellery store in 2014.The Paris prosecutor, Laure Beccuau, has said the suspect had told police little but had “partially admitted” his involvement in the Louvre heist. Another suspect in the Louvre case arrested last week had been convicted in the same 2014 robbery, she said.Beccuau also said the suspects’ profiles “do not correspond with those one generally associates” with high-level, meticulously planned organised crime, prompting French media to speculate that they may have been hired by an unknown mastermind.The suspect had been initially scheduled to stand trial on Wednesday on minor charges of breaking a mirror and damaging the door of the prison cell where he was detained in 2019 as part of a separate theft investigation, which later cleared him, Associated Press reported.Explore more on these topicsParisFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Barton denies all charges.Barton, 43, first accused Vine of being a paedophile when the former BBC Radio 2 presenter responded to posts Barton had made on X likening the female football pundits Lucy Ward and Eni Aluko to the serial killers Fred and Rose West after a January 2024 FA Cup game they had worked on.Vine responded to the posts after feeling “quite shocked by what Mr Barton had said about two very respected commentators” and reprimanded him, asking: “Are we dealing with a brain injury here?”Barton responded by calling Vine a “big bike nonce”. He later asked Vine “have you been on Epstein Island?” and “are you going to be on these flight logs?”He went on to tell Vine that he might “as well own up now because I’d phone the police if I saw you near a primary school on ya bike”, and posted an image of Vine with the caption: “If you see this fella by a primary school call 999.”Vine told the court that Barton’s posts made him “feel physically unsafe” and he feared Barton and his followers were “like-minded”.“If people want to find out where you live, they can,” Vine told the court. “I took some advice about my security, I varied my movements. I do believe these messages put me in danger, in physical danger.”Vine also spoke about the mental anguish he felt from the allegations, saying that having your reputation “stripped from you by someone I have never met is completely devastating” and that his wife saw him “in pieces”.Representing Barton, Simon Csoka KC claimed Vine was “just trying to be provocative on Twitter to get in on this story”.Vine denied this but agreed with Csoka that his message was meant “as an amusing jibe”.“I was actually trying to help the two targets of Mr Barton’s abuse and I probably did it in a silly way,” Vine told the court. “It certainly did not justify what followed.”The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

NGN also published theNews of the World, which was closed after the phone-hacking scandal.It has now emerged in court that Jefferies and NGN settled a claim at the high court in November 2024. News UK, the parent company of NGN, said the settlement was made on the basis of the invasion of Jefferies’ privacy by the News of the World.NGN agreed to pay damages, but the court was told it did so with “no admission of liability in relation to the claimant’s allegations of voicemail interception and/or other unlawful information gathering at the Sun”.Lurid stories about Jefferies and his life regularly appeared in the press after it emerged that Yeates, who disappeared in December 2010, had been his tenant. She was later found dead.Jefferies was initially arrested by police and held in custody for three days. However, he was found to have no connection to the crime. Vincent Tabak, a Dutch engineer who had lived in the UK since 2007, was eventually jailed for a minimum of 20 years after being found guilty of the murder.Jefferies claimed that NGN had published private information about his life throughout most of 2011. The court was told the articles relating to him “had a damaging and long-lasting effect on him and his private life, including his standing in the community and to his relationships with some friends”.Mariyam Kamil, a Matrix Chambers barrister for NGN, said: “The defendant is here today, through me, to offer its apologies to Mr Jefferies for the distress caused to him by the invasion of his privacy by individuals working for or on behalf of the News of the World.“The defendant acknowledges that such activity should never have taken place and that it had no right to intrude into Mr Jefferies’s private life in this way.”It marks the latest vindication for Jefferies. While police insisted they had been right to arrest him, theyapologised in 2013for not making it clear sooner that he was innocent.Jefferies was arrested and questioned for two days after the body of 25-year-old Yeates was found on Christmas Day in 2010. Tabak was charged with Yeates’s murder three weeks later, but Jefferies remained on police bail until March 2011.The chief constable of Avon and Somerset police, Nick Gargan, said arresting Jefferies had been an “integral step” in the inquiry, but accepted that once he had been released from bail, the force should have considered making it clear in public he was innocent.Speaking in 2012, Jefferies said he had been the victim of a “character assassination” by some of the media. He said he had been presented as a “dark, macabre, sinister villain … a lewd figure … a peeping Tom”.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

His son was regularly searching online for violent material and went on to order a stockpile of weapons.“The combination of fear and the desire to avoid confrontation by not inquiring into his activities and accepting his punishments undoubtedly prevented me from doing things that would be expected of a parent, such as to monitor his internet activity,” he said in a written statement. “This had catastrophic consequences, for which I am desperately sorry.”Giving evidence to the inquiry at Liverpool town hall via video link on Wednesday, Alphonse Rudakubana said he accepted his “share of the responsibility” for his son’s actions, which included stabbing three young girls to death at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.Alphonse Rudakubana also repeatedly criticised other agencies at the hearing, accusing teachers of unfairly singling out Axel for punishment and of making “malicious” referrals to the Prevent counter-terrorism scheme, describing one school as “like a prison”.The inquiry also heard that the teenager’s parents and older brother had found knife packaging minutes after the then 17-year-old left home to carry out the attack – the first time he had left the house alone in more than two years. However, they failed to call the police.Days earlier, Alphonse Rudakubana had stopped his son from returning to his former school, where he is thought to have been planning to attack pupils against whom he held a “dangerous grudge”.Axel’s brother, Dion Rudakubana, said he was “surprised” when his younger brother left the house alone on the morning of 29 July last year and initially feared he may be planning to attack someone.However, he said this worry had been “quite quickly subdued” by his parents, who thought he had just gone for a walk: “The sentiment was that this was a positive step – this was him combating a fear.”Dion Rudakubana said his mother had gone back to bed to recover from a night shift despite finding the opened knife packaging and Axel’s unexplained trip out of the house.The teenager had by this time been excluded from school for carrying a knife, and two years earlier had told police he intended to stab someone when he was caught with a blade on a bus. His family had been hiding their kitchen knives since 2019, the inquiry heard.Southport inquiry to examine ‘wholesale failure’ to prevent attackRead moreDion Rudakubana said he believed his brother had not left the house alone since 17 March 2022, when he was reported missing by his parents and found by police officers carrying a knife on a bus. Axel told officers at the scene that he intended to murder someone so that he could delete his social media profiles.In sometimes combative evidence to the public inquiry, Alphonse Rudakubana denied “scrabbling around for any possible excuse for [his] son’s criminal behaviour”. He accused teachers at Range high school of unfairly singling him out, before he was permanently excluded for attacking a pupil and carrying knives in October 2019.By early 2024, he said, his son’s behaviour at home had become “very frightening”. He recalled one incident in which the teenager poured oil over his father’s head and threatened to murder him if he had him removed from home, telling him: “It may take a day, it may take a week, it may take a month [but] trust me, I will kill you.”He told the inquiry: “I had lost control of [Axel]. I had no authority over him as a father. He was questioning everything about me – the way I speak, why am I at home, ‘My mother should be at home,’ I should be working.“I was reduced to – he was calling me Alphonse because I didn’t deserve ‘Dad’ – somebody who feed him and do all he ask. I had no power at all to stop him from accessing anything he wanted to look at online.”He said nobody had known the teenager was viewing extreme violence, antisemitic material, anti-Islamic and sexist images: “There was another side to him that I didn’t know.”Earlier, Dion Rudakubana said he did not know why his brother had targeted young girls but that it may be “because children are very valuable to society, in that they are society’s future and it would hurt society particular badly if children were to be harmed. I think it would be something along those lines but I say this in retrospect.”Detectives have never established a clear motive for why the teenager murdered three young girls and stabbed 10 others at a summer holiday club, and they have consistently ruled out terrorism.Dion Rudakubana said his younger brother had amassed a large number of parcels in the living room, which neither he nor his parents were allowed to touch. In written evidence, he said he was “worried the parcels had something bad in them” and told the inquiry that he suspected it could be a weapon or “certainly something dangerous”.However, he said this fear was “never sufficiently dominant for me to go and say something”.Asked by Richard Boyle, counsel to the inquiry, whether it would have been “very dangerous” if the troubled teenager had access to weapons, given his history of violence, he said: “Yes [but] I didn’t think there was an imminent threat for my life as a result of these boxes.”Boyle asked whether he had thought about the threat to others. He replied: “No, I didn’t consider that, considering how isolated these instances were [of Axel Rudakubana being violent to others]. I didn’t associate any risk of harm with anyone outside the home. It’s within the home [that] it was apparent on a daily basis.”Dion said he had returned from university on 26 July, three days before the attack, and his father had made a “vague” reference to his brother having “done something bad” days earlier.He said he had only later learned that this related to his younger brother being stopped by his father from getting into a taxi when he is believed to have been planning to attack pupils at Range high school in Formby, from where he was excluded in 2019.In his written statement, Dion said his father had seemed “afraid” of the 17-year-old in the days before the attack, “which was unusual”.He messaged a friend on 26 July to say that his father had told him: “Your brother is dangerous, he can kill you.” He told the inquiry: “I don’t think he directly said: ‘He can kill you’ but rather indicated that there was a threat to life, and I felt that.”The inquiry continues.Explore more on these topicsSouthport attackEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Rebecca Newsom, the global political expert for Greenpeace International, said: “It’s notable that the roadmap recognises new taxes and levies as key to unlocking public climate finance. Given reported profits from just five international oil and gas giants over the last decade reached almost$800bn, taxing fossil fuel corporations isclearly a huge opportunityto overcome national fiscal constraints.”World leaders are descending on Belém, the Brazilian city at the mouth of the Amazon, for two days of talks starting on Thursday, before theUN Cop30 climate summitformally begins, and finance will be high on their agenda.The roadmap will form the basis of discussions of climate finance at Cop30.Last year’s “conference of the parties” in Baku set a goal of £1.3tn to be provided annually to poor countries by 2035, to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather. But there was a bitter taste for many when rich countries pledged to stump up only $300bn of that sum, leaving the rest to come from potential new taxes and levies, the private sector, and related sources.The Baku to Belém roadmap is an attempt to heal those divisions, by showing how the finance goal can be reached. Mukhtar Babayev, the Azerbaijani minister who was president of Cop29, said: “The roadmap shows there is a clear path to scaling up climate finance to the developing world to $1.3tn by 2035. It is possible, but political will and global action are absolutely necessary.”He warned: “As temperatures continue to rise and countries submit their next climate plans scaling up finance is the critical factor for success. Countries simply cannot cut emissions if they cannot count on the capital they need to meet their ambitions.”Developing countries suffering from high debt burdens also need relief, potentially through swapping some of their outstanding debt for investment in projects that cut greenhouse gas emissions or help countries adapt to the impacts of climate breakdown, according to the report.Making it easier and cheaper for developing countries to gain access to private sector capital for their clean energy investments will be key, the roadmap acknowledges. Developing countries currently pay much higher interest rates on loans and capital injections than their rich counterparts, butassistance from the World Bank and other publicly funded institutions could drastically reduce that, making it easier for poor countries to fund their climate projects.Equity and the social impacts of the shift to clean energy must also be high priorities, according to the report. “Without careful attention to the social dimensions of this transformation, there is a risk of exacerbating inequality, undermining public trust, and slowing progress on climate action. Building fair change together with workers, women, Indigenous Peoples and local communities supported by dedicated funding windows can have catalytic effects.”The World Bank and other multilateral development banks will also need “replenishment” – fresh capital from the governments that are their shareholders. That may be more difficult to find now that President Donald Trump hasdismantledmuch of US overseas aid, and other countries are also cutting their aid budgets.Campaigners said there was no escaping the reality that rich governments must step up to help the poor, if the world was to avoid the worst of the climate crisis. Carolina Pasquali, the executive director of Greenpeace Brasil, said: “The inequalities left behind by the inadequate climate finance goal agreed at Cop29 have not been resolved with this roadmap – we still need significantly more public finance for mitigation [cutting and avoiding emissions], adaptation and loss and damage.”She added: “While the roadmap rightly recognises the gap in concessional finance, including for nature and providing direct access to Indigenous peoples and local communities, it does not go far enough in holding developed countries accountable. We still need to see the money for real support to developing countries if we are serious about climate justice.”Explore more on these topicsCop30Climate crisisUnited NationsFossil fuelsGreenhouse gas emissionsRenewable energyShareReuse this content"

Worsening marine heatwaves cause corals to expel the algae that gives them their colour and much of their nutrients – a process known as coral bleaching that can weaken or kill corals. Mass bleaching events, once unheard of, have become increasingly common on the reef.Mumby said projections about the reef’s future have previously concentrated on the impact of heat without considering ways some corals and reefs can adapt to temperatures.The research,published in the journal Nature Communications, took into account how some corals – even those of the same species – can tolerate higher temperatures than others, and how those traits can be passed on to their offspring.The modelling simulated the “eco-evolutionary dynamics” of each of the Great Barrier Reef’s 3,800 individual reefs, including how reefs seed their neighbours with coral babies and how some were in naturally cooler places – known as “climate refugia”.Dr Yves-Marie Bozec, lead author of the research at UQ, said: “We ran all of those factors with the most up-to-date climate projections – and the news was not good.”As global temperatures rise to 1.5C the study shows these natural abilities cannot keep up and the amount of coral on the Great Barrier Reef roughly halves by 2040.View image in fullscreenNew research shows the future for the Great Barrier Reef under different levels of global heating. The top panel shows the percentage of individual reefs each year under different heat stress levels. The lower panel shows changes in the amount of coral across the entire Great Barrier Reef under different levels of warming.Illustration: Yves-Marie Bozec/University of QueenslandMumby said by mid-century “there will still be places that look like reefs do today, but they will be few and far between”.The modelling found if global temperature was kept below 2C then reefs slowly recover their coral almost to levels seen in the recent past.Mumby said reefs in naturally cooler areas or those that could be seeded from nearby reefs all fared better. This showed, he said, that concentrating conservation efforts in those places could reap rewards.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it also amplifies the case for us to take as much local action as possible.”Prof Morgan Pratchett, a reef expert at James Cook University and editor-in-chief of the scientific journal Coral Reefs who was not involved in the research, said the study was likely to “stimulate a lot of discussion”.He said the paper’s assumption that naturally cooler reefs could support recovery was likely “unfounded optimism”, as these areas were likely to be overwhelmed in worsening heatwaves.“The main issue is that we are yet to see clear evidence of the climate action necessary to constrain further temperature increases,” he said.“We need urgent and substantial action on climate change if we are to have any hope of conserving coral reef ecosystems.”Explore more on these topicsGreat Barrier ReefOceansQueenslandShareReuse this content"

But the price it will earn for each unit of electricity generated will rise.Officials have offered the power plant a guaranteed price of £157.50 for every megawatt-hour of electricity it generates between 2027 and 2031, in today’s prices, which could be higher with inflation.This would be higher than the current price of £142.24/MWh earned by the power plant, and double the current wholesale market price of electricity bought in advance, which is just over £78/MWh.When the deal was agreed in February, the energy minister, Michael Shanks, said the company’s subsidies had been cut because it “simply did not deliver a good enough deal for bill payers and enabled Drax to make unacceptably large profits”.Under the terms of the new contract, the company will have to switch to using 100% woody biomass from sustainable sources, up from the current level of 70%. The government threatened “substantial penalties” if Drax does not comply.Will Gardiner, the chief executive of Drax, said: “We are pleased to have agreed this new contract with the UK government, which will support UK energy security into the 2030s and deliver a net saving for consumers compared with alternative sources of dispatchable generation.“The agreement will support the rollout of intermittent renewable generation across the UK and provides options to ensure Drax Power Station continues to play a long-term role in the regional economy and UK energy system,” Gardiner said.The company claims that independent analysis, undertaken by consultants at Baringa, found that the deal will deliver savings of up to £3.1bn over the four-year term by avoiding the need to produce extra power generation capacity, and reducing the UK reliance on gas and interconnectors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The findings were dismissed by Drax as “flawed” and the company accused its authors of ignoring its “widely accepted and internationally recognised approach to carbon accounting”.Earlier this year, the FCA, the City watchdog,began an investigationinto Drax over “historical statements” made about the sourcing of wood pellets to examine whether the company had complied with disclosure and transparency rules.Explore more on these topicsDraxEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Cranswick was responsible for three million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions in 2024.If all applications reviewed were accepted for development, an additional 30,000 pigs and nearly five million chickens would be farmed across England, Northern Ireland and Wales – amounting to more than 37 million additional animals reared in the UK each year.Intensivepigandpoultryfarms are high emitters of methane and nitrous oxide, potent greenhouse gases that cause about30and 300 times more global warming respectively than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. According to Sustain’s estimates, if all the applications analysed were approved this could generate an estimated 634,000 tonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions annually — the equivalent of 488,000 return flights from London to New York.None of the 35 applications provided figures on likely emissions from the farm, despite the fact that councils are required to factor in climate harms in planning decisions. Governmentpoliciessay that local planning should support the country’s goal to reach net zero by 2050.The findings come as numbers of intensive livestock farmsincreaseacross Europe, with more than 1,500 industrial-scale pig and poultry farms operating in the UK.“Vital information is being kept from councils and the public,” Ruth Westcott, campaign manager at Sustain, said.“It’s clear that agribusinesses don’t want to come clean about the pollution they cause because it could affect whether they are allowed to expand, and thus make more profits at the expense of our communities,” she added. “It’s an emissions scandal.”Councils are facing growing pressure from residents to refuse planning permission to companies which fail to robustly assess climate impacts.In April, after public pressure, King’s Lynn & West Norfolk borough councildeniedplanning permission for the Methwold megafarm that would have housed almost 900,000 chickens and pigs, partly due to its lack of climate assessment – making it the first-known refusal on these grounds.Breckland council in Norfolk likewise refused planning permission to the Cherry Tree Farm in October, in part because it had not provided an updated environmental impact assessment, including “project-specific carbon emissions”. The farm – which is owned by Wayland Farms, also a subsidiary of Cranswick – was forced to apply for retrospective approval for previously completed construction. Local residents had madecomplaintsover the “stench” after its expansion in 2019.When asked about the lack of climate data in its applications, Cranswick declined to comment.In total, four of the applications reviewed have been refused so far – three of which were submitted by Cranswick.However, other councils in Norfolk, Nottinghamshire, Suffolk, Lincolnshire and Yorkshire have approved six farms that have not provided any specific information on the farm’s climate impacts in the past 12 months, the research shows.Councils which responded to requests for comment said they had complied with planning regulations, and that they were unable to comment on individual planning applications.More than half (57%) of the planning applications reviewed were for major extensions and alterations, and the remainder for new farms.Jan Palmer – a resident of Methwold village in Norfolk who campaigned against the Cranswick megafarm that was denied planning permission in April – has called for greater scrutiny of impacts from proposed farms.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It’s called industrial farming, and it has industrial emissions,” she said. “If my local megafarm application hadn’t been so fiercely challenged, and by so many, it would’ve slipped through the system like so many others do – quietly and without scrutiny but with devastating consequences.”Companies seeking permission for anylarge-scaledevelopments – ranging from motorways and oil and gas extraction sites to intensive farms –are required toconduct environmental impact assessments showing the likely effects of developments on biodiversity, the climate, and other environmental factors.Applications for intensive livestock farms routinely include information on issues such as air pollutants and unpleasant smells, the review showed. However, the vast majority of applications overlooked climate impacts.Of the applications reviewed, 35% mentioned the farm’s operations only in passing, while 55% did not discuss these climate impacts at all.Large projects must assess all “significant environmental impacts” under UK planning law. Lawyers said few cases had so far tested the threshold for significant climate impacts from farms in the courts, but given the well-documented emissions from intensive farming, applications could face growing challenges in coming years.“Where the companies are not assessing their climate impacts, they may be open to legal challenge,” said Ricardo Gama, an environmental lawyer at Leigh Day solicitors. “Agriculture has flown under the radar on so many of these issues, but I think that is changing.”Over the past year, six local councils have granted permission to applications which did not contain any assessment of the farms’ likely emissions, as well as one that granted permission to a farm with only passing discussion, the research shows.Planning authorities have an obligation to consider all relevant environmental impacts before granting permission, according to legal experts.While applicants propose which environmental impacts should be assessed as part of planning applications, it is the council’s legal responsibility to ensure that all significant effects are covered and that adequate information on these is provided before granting planning permission.“When the council or the inspector or the secretary of state is considering whether to grant planning permission, climate impacts need to be weighed in the balance,” Gama said. “I think councils’ approach[es] will change as the public becomes more aware of the climate impact of agriculture.”The research found that environmental assessments also repeatedly failed to discuss emissions that did not directly arise on the farms. Of the 35 applications reviewed, just one included information on the farm’s likely emissions from animal feed – the largest source of greenhouse gases for both big livestock and poultry.The majority of pigs and chickens in the UK are fed soy, which is one of the biggest drivers of deforestation in regions such as the Amazon.According tocampaign group WWF, the UK’s demand for soy requires more than 1.7m hectares of land each year – an area larger than Northern Ireland.One environmental impact assessment for the expansion of a poultry megafarm currently under consideration in Shropshire – which would increase its total number of birds to up to 350,000 – stated that carbon dioxide emitted from the development would be offset “due to the reduction in emissions from transporting poultry meat from elsewhere”.Transportation accounts for between just 5-7% of total emissions from chickens reared in the UK.A Shropshire council spokesperson said applications were processed “in accordance with [EIA] regulations”, which included taking into account direct and indirect effects of the proposed development on the environment.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentFarmingClimate crisisGreenhouse gas emissionsnewsShareReuse this content"

It has a heavy bone structure and stocky, muscular body. Fully grown adult males can weigh more than 57kg (9st).XL bullies made up half of the banned or dangerous dogs seized and euthanised by police forces in England andWaleslast year. A freedom of information request by Radar shows 3,464 suspected XL bullies were seized in 2024, accounting for about half of the total 7,004 banned or dangerous dogs seized by the 36 police forces that provided data.Explore more on these topicsDangerous dogsPoliceWalesAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Half of those 2,000 would be made available this year to help tackle a bottleneck in resident doctors becoming specialists, he said.In addition, theNHSwould put more money in the pockets of resident doctors by paying fees for exams they take and membership of professional bodies they belong to.However, Streeting ruled out increasing their pay any further in 2025-26, citing the straitened public finances and the 28.9% pay rise they have had since 2023 to explain his inability to do so. The bulk of that rise has come since Labour took office in July 2024.But Dr Jack Fletcher, the chair of the RDC, rebuffed Streeting’s offer and said it would still leave far too many doctors unable to progress their careers and in effect jobless.“This does not go far enough,” he said. “Even with this offer, thousands of doctors would still be unable to find a job. Thirty thousand doctors applied for 10,000 [training] places this year – [so] 1,000 more is not going to fix this crisis, nor come anywhere near doing so.“Whatever else is true of this offer, Mr Streeting is still not facing up to the gravity of the situation: doctors facing unemployment while patients can’t see a doctor.”He urged Streeting to offer resident doctors a multi-year pay deal that would lead them to restore over time the significant loss in value of their salaries since 2006, though he did not specify the 29% rise the BMA is seeking. The 2.5% rise Streeting has offered for 2026-27 would be another real-terms pay cut, he added.“Strikes can still be avoided but first there will need willingness to offer a pay deal and a genuine solution on jobs,” Fletcher said.Explore more on these topicsNHSDoctorsWes StreetingHealthIndustrial actionPublic sector payEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Any child, from any background, can be affected. That’s why we need a relentless focus on tackling abuse to ensure every child can grow up safe, supported, and happy.”The data showed LGBTQ+ people were disproportionately affected by childhood abuse, with 48.1% of gay and lesbian people, and 62.5% of bisexual people, experiencing abuse before the age of 18, compared with 27.7% of heterosexual people.More than half (53.4%) of people with a gender identity different from the sex they were registered at birth experienced abuse as a child, nearly twice the proportion for people with a gender identity the same as their sex registered at birth (28.9%).Ben Kernighan, co-CEO of LGBTQ+ anti-abuse charity Galop, said its research had shown a significant proportion of LGBTQ+ people in the UK had experienced abuse from family members, and the vast majority felt their identity was the main reason, or part of the reason, for the abuse.Disabled people also reported higher rates of childhood abuse, at 42% compared with 26.4% for those not disabled.People from a mixed ethnic background reported rates of childhood abuse at 40.2%, higher than those of a white (31%), black (18.2%) or Asian ethnicity (14.7%).The estimates are based on responses collected for the Crime Survey for England andWalesin the year to March 2024, and are the first of their kind to use an expanded definition of childhood abuse.In the survey, emotional abuse is defined as “persistent emotional maltreatment of a child” by an adult, and neglect refers to instances when a parent or guardian did not meet a child’s basic needs such as food, clothing or shelter, or did not supervise a child adequately.Explore more on these topicsChildrenEnglandWalesChild protectionnewsShareReuse this content"

He was summoned aged 10 to Spain by Franco, who trained him to be his successor.“I respected him enormously, appreciated his intelligence and political sense,” Juan Carlos said of Franco. In the 500-page book, published in French on Wednesday and in Spanish next month, he recalls sitting beside Franco as the ailing dictator lay dying in his hospital bed.“He took my hand and said, as if it was his last breath: ‘Your highness, I ask you just one thing: keep the country united,’” Juan Carlos recalled.He was crowned king two days after Franco’s death in 1975.In the memoir he also writes about the death in 1956 of his 14-year-old brother, Alfonso, in Portugal as the pair cleaned a pistol – a case that has never been fully investigated. He writes that it’s the first time he has spoken of the traumatic episode.“I lost a friend, a confidant. He left a huge void,” he said. “Without his death, my life would have been less bleak, less unhappy.”Whatever credit he gained from opposing the coup was squandered over the years as news of his extramarital affairs and allegations of tax fraud emerged. He said he bitterly regretted his long-running affair with the Danish-German socialite Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn, saying it had harmed his reputation among his compatriots and led to his downfall and self-imposed exile in Abu Dhabi.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If they do this to the president, what happens to all the other women in the country?”Commentators said the incident showed that no woman was immune to sexual harassment inMexico.“Even if you’re the president, any guy believes he has the right to touch you,”saidCatalina Ruiz-Navarro, a journalist for the feminist outlet Volcánicas. “When they ask what the patriarchy is – this is it.”But the incident also highlighted the broader security risk that Sheinbaum faces on the street, given that her security detail was not clearly visible in the video and it took seconds for anyone to intervene.It comes just days after Carlos Alberto Manzo Rodríguez, a popular mayor,was killedat the Day of the Dead celebrations in Uruapan, in the state of Michoacán, by a gunman who shot him seven times at close range before being killed himself.In the months prior, Manzo Rodríguez had publicly appealed to Sheinbaum on social media for help to confront criminal groups in the region.1:34Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum addresses groping incident – videoManzo Rodríguez was only the latest official to be killed in Mexico, where37 candidateswere killed on the campaign trail before the election in June 2024, and another 10 municipal presidents have been killed since Sheinbaum’s government began on 1 October.Even though it is local authorities that are most frequently targeted in Mexico, high-level officials are not exempt from risk.In 1994, the presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta was gunned down at a rally in the border city of Tijuana. More recently, in 2020, the Jalisco cartel tried to assassinate Omar García Harfuch, Sheinbaum’s current security minister, riddling his convoy with bullets in the middle of Mexico City.Sheinbaum herself hada security scarelast year while campaigning in the state of Chiapas, when masked men stopped her vehicle to ask her to address the violence in the state, before letting her move on.Nonetheless, Sheinbaum has kept the habit of her popular predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who mingled with crowds and preferred a lighter degree of security, and said that she would not be changing her security arrangements.“We cannot distance ourselves from the people,” said Sheinbaum. “That would be to deny where we come from and who we are.”“Hopefully [the presidency will press charges], and the president will send a clear message: no man has the right to kiss or touch a woman without her consent,” wrote Alejandra Escobar, editorial director of Etcétera, a Mexican magazine,on X. “May this also serve as an example for [her assistants]: it is not acceptable for her to be so exposed.”Explore more on these topicsClaudia SheinbaumMexicoAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Although the missile and the drone are both capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, neither of these were actual tests of nuclear bombs.A Russian nuclear test would mark an extraordinary rupture of a long-held pause in testing: the US last conducted a test in 1992, China and France in 1996, and the Soviet Union in 1990. Post-Soviet Russia, which inherited the USSR’s nuclear arsenal, has never done one.Much of Putin’s show of strength appears to stem from Russia’s recent advances in Ukraine.Russia has spent more than a year trying to seize Pokrovsk, an important frontline city and logistical hub seen as the gateway to Donetsk, and has suffered heavy losses in the process.Home to about 50,000 people before the war, the city lies on a crucial highway connecting a network of urban strongholds that make up Ukraine’s last major defensive line in the Donetsk region. Its fall would represent a breakthrough for Moscow, bringing Russian forces closer to their longstanding goal of seizing the entire region.In recent weeks, Russian forces have sharply intensified their attacks, initially relying on small dismounted assault groups before gradually massing enough troops to launch a broader offensive on the city.DeepState, a Ukrainian project that tracks the frontline using verified open-source imagery, showed on Tuesday that Russian forces had advanced further into Pokrovsk and its outskirts, though much of the area remained shaded grey – indicating it was still contested.In an evening update, the project added: “The situation remains critical.”Artem Karyakin, a well-known soldier in the Ukrainian armed forces, wrote on X that Russian troops were “present in every district of the city”.“There is no good news from there; the situation remains tense. While Russian forces have not yet fully taken control of the city, fighting is ongoing,” he added.Over the weekend, Ukraine deployed special forces to Pokrovsk in an effort to change the momentum and prevent a possible encirclement. Ukraine’s defence intelligence released footage of the Tymur special unit in action, showing a helicopter landing under fire, fierce street fighting, and drone strikes on Russian positions.However, the daring operation does not appear to have shifted the situation in Ukraine’s favour.Some Ukrainian and western commentators have questioned Kyiv’s decision to continue defending Pokrovsk, arguing that it exposes its soldiers to grave danger in what may already be a lost battle.View image in fullscreenZelenskyy (right) visits troops near Pokrovsk.Photograph: Ukraine Presidency/Planet Pix/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock“Ukraine may be repeating a costly mistake in Pokrovsk,” wrote Emil Kastehelmi, an analyst with the Finland-based Black Bird Group, which monitors the war, on X.“It’s a recurring pattern, seen for example in Vuhledar and Kursk – a reluctance to conduct a controlled, militarily justified withdrawal from a threatened salient when the situation no longer favours the defender,” he added, referring to areas Ukraine eventually abandoned after prolonged standoffs.Ukrainska Pravda, Ukraine’s leading independent outlet, has previouslycriticisedthe country’s military command for errors made in Pokrovsk and reported that some brigades have misled superiors about their frontline positions.Even without those concerns, the Ukrainian army is fighting an uphill battle, worn down by the same pressures that forced retreats in the past: acute shortages of men and the constant barrage of Russian drones cutting supply lines.Moscow has also recently gained a new battlefield advantage, deploying jet-powered glide bombs capable of striking targets far beyond the frontline – a significant upgrade to its arsenal, and one that has placed an even greater strain on Ukraine’s already stretched air defences.Kyiv will be hoping the eventual fall of Pokrovsk does not give Moscow a springboard for a renewed push towards Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, the two largest Ukrainian-held cities in the Donetsk region, which Russia has long sought to seize.While Russian forces continue to advance, their progress remains slow and costly, raising questions over whether they have the capacity to push on further.At the same time, Ukrainian forces are stretched out on other parts of the front.Russian troops have entered Kupiansk, a strategically important city in the northern Kharkiv region, which Moscow claims to have encircled. Ukraine has denied those claims, with Zelenskyy saying earlier this week that Ukrainian units were working to eliminate what he described as about 60 Russian soldiers in the city.The worsening situation in the east comes as diplomatic contacts between Russia and the US over the war in Ukraine appear to have ground to a halt.Speaking last week after a meeting with Xi Jinping in South Korea, Trump appeared to signal a more hands-off approach, saying: “Sometimes you have to let them fight.”Last month, his administration imposed tough sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil producers, measures that appear to have hit the country’s energy revenues.At the same time, however, the US president has continued to withhold longer-range weapons, including Tomahawk missiles, from Ukraine.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeNuclear weaponsnewsShareReuse this content"

His predecessor, Benedict XVI, also opposed the title.John Paul II, the pope from 1978 to his death in 2005, was a proponent but stopped using the title publicly in the mid-1990s amid growing scepticism.According tothe decree, the title “creates confusion and an imbalance in the harmony of the truths of the Christian faith” and “carries the risk of eclipsing the exclusive role of Jesus Christ”.Cardinal Víctor Manuel Fernández, the prefect of the Vatican’s doctrinal office, wrote in a preface to the decree that it was a response to questions in recent years about devotion to Mary and to clarify what is acceptable.“There are some Marian reflection groups, publications, new devotions, and even requests for Marian dogmas that do not share the same characteristics as popular devotion,” he wrote, adding that some devotional practices expressed “intensely through social media” could sow confusion among Catholics.Iacopo Scaramuzzi, the Vatican correspondent forLa Repubblica newspaper, said the decree was a way of putting the brakes on “the cult of the Madonna”. “The Vatican is cracking down on a devotion which is spreading on social media, and which is a specific devotion embraced especially by conservative Catholics,” he said.Last year the Vaticantightened rulessurrounding supernatural phenomena such as apparitions of the Virgin Mary amid a crackdown on scams and hoaxes, which have proliferated in the age of social media.Pope Franciswarned in 2023that apparitions of Mary “are not always real”, in what was believed to have been an indirect reference to a woman who drew thousands of pilgrims to a town near Rome to pray before a statue that she claimed had shed tears of blood. “When Marian devotion is too self-centred, it’s not good,” Francis said.Robert Mickens, a Rome-based Vatican expert, said the latest move would please progressive Catholics. “Mary’s considered the most exalted of all human creatures but she’s not semi-divine,” he said.Explore more on these topicsCatholicismVaticanThe papacyPope Leo XIVChristianityReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

The unanimous ruling cleared the way for a federal judge to enforce a potentially disruptive shake-up that’s designed to give consumers more choices.The specific terms of the settlement agreement remain under seal and must be approved by US district judge James Donato, but the two companies broadly outlined some of their agreements in their joint filing. A hearing is set for Thursday.They said the settlement closely follows Donato’s October 2024 ruling ordering Google to tear down the digital walls shielding its Android app store from competition. That included a provision that will require its app store to distribute rival third-party app stores so consumers can download them to their phones, if they so desire.The curious case of Epic Games: how the developer beat Google but not AppleRead moreGoogle had hoped to void those changes with an appeal, but the ruling issued in July by the ninth circuit court of appeals delivered a legal blow for the tech company, which has been waylaid in three separate antitrust trials affecting different pillars of its internet empire.EpicGamesfiled lawsuits targeting Google’s Play Store as well as Apple’s iPhone App Store in 2020 in an attempt to bypass exclusive payment processing systems that charged 15% to 30% commissions on in-app transactions. The settlement agreement proposed Tuesday calls for Google to limit those payments to between 9% and 20%, depending on the transaction.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyGoogleFortniteAlphabetGamesnewsShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, there were one-day falls for all of the“magnificent seven” AI-related stocks, including the chipmaker Nvidia, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Alphabet (the owner of Google) and Meta (the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp).The S&P also closed down just over 1% as it lost ground because of tech stocks, particularly the data analytics companyPalantir, which slumped by almost 8% despite having raised its revenue outlook the previous day.Palantir has also been targeted by a well-known short-seller – who bets on falls in the value of a company.The investor Michael Burry – who rose to prominence after predicting the 2008 financial crash andinspiring the film The Big Short– bet against Palantir and the chipmaker Nvidia, two of the biggest AI companies, sparking criticism from Palantir’s boss and a stock sell-off.In aninterview on CNBC, Alex Karp, Palantir’s chief executive, criticised Burry and other short-sellers for “trying to call the AI revolution into question”.Asian markets followed the US falls on Wednesday,recording the sharpest slidein seven months, as the concerns about tech stocks spread, and indices in Japan and South Korea dropped more than 5% from the record highs reached the previous day. In Europe, markets in the UK, France and Germany dropped slightly on Wednesday morning.The market falls came as the chief executives of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs cautioned there could be a market correction ahead.They added their voices to that of Jamie Dimon, the head of the US’s largest bank, JP Morgan Chase, whowarned in Octoberhe was worried markets would crash in the next six months to two years.Jim Reid, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said there was a “growing chorusdiscussing whether we might be on the verge of an equity correction”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Perplexity’s system posed security risks to customer data, Amazon alleged, and the startup had ignored repeated requests to stop.“Rather than be transparent, Perplexity has purposely configured its CometAI software to not identify the Comet AI agent’s activities in the Amazon Store,” it said.In the complaint, Amazon accused Perplexity’s Comet AI agent of degrading customers’ shopping experience and interfering with its ability to ensure customers who use the agent benefit from the tailored shopping experience Amazon curated over decades.Third-party apps making purchases for users should operate openly and respect businesses’ decisions on whether to participate, Amazon said in an earlier statement.Perplexity earlier said it had received a legal threat from Amazon demanding that it block the Comet AI agent from shopping on the platform, calling the move a broader threat to user choice and the future of AI assistants.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Clinical studies have shown that Mounjaro is more effective in causing weight loss than Wegovy.Novo Nordisk said it now expected full-year operating profit to grow by a maximum 7% in 2025, compared with an earlier forecast of up to 16%. In addition, the company forecasted sales to grow by no more than 11%, at constant exchange rates, compared with a previous forecast of up to 16%. It has cut forecasts four times this year.The company said its third-quarter sales increased by 5% to 75bn Danish kroner (£8.9bn), below the 76.2bn forecast by analysts, while its sales grew by 11% during the period.Last month, Novo said its chair, Helge Lund, and six other board members were stepping down in a surprise shake-up, after a row with the company’s majority shareholder. In May, it announced Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen would be stepping down as chief executive.The Danish drugmaker is also locked in atussle with the drugmaker Pfizerto buy the US obesity-focused biotech firm Metsera.In late October, Novo launched a surprise $9bn (£6.9bn) offer, which threatened an existing bid from Pfizer.Both companies have since submitted improved offers for Metsera as the two companies fight for dominance in the lucrative weight-loss market.Pfizer previously requested a temporary restraining order in a US court, looking to stop Novo’s bid. This was rejected by a judge in Delaware.

The company has four ongoing clinical trials, including a weight-loss pill, a monthly injection, and two drugs that promote the sensation of feeling full.Derren Nathan, the head of equity research at the investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Novo Nordisk’s CEO Mike Doustdar’s first set of results in the hot seat have come with slimmed down guidance for the full year. Hardly an ideal start but better for him to cut now while fingers can still be pointed at legacy issues.“The contrast in these results to knockout third-quarter numbers from arch-rival Eli Lilly highlights the scale of the task for the new captain to turn the ship around.”Novo’s share price has halved this year and the drugmaker, which remains one of Europe’s largest companies, hascut 9,000 jobs.Explore more on these topicsPharmaceuticals industryObesitynewsShareReuse this content"

The maths is often complex – but the rule of thumb has always been that the benefit equates to about 20% of each production’s budget.View image in fullscreenFor Love or Money had a budget of £4.3m and claimed tax credits of £994,353 – or 23% of the budget – accounts filed with Companies House suggest.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockSo, if a producer wants to make a small film with a UK budget of £1m, they should be entitled to about £200,000 in tax credits. Once they have provided the necessary costs and invoices, film-makers can claim that benefit as cash, before their film has even been released.The story of Latham’s moviemaking seems to involve him fully embracing this scheme, all of which is set out in the public accounts of each of the films’ holding companies.For example, For Love or Money had a budget of £4.3m and claimed tax credits of £994,353 – or 23% of the budget – accounts filed with Companies House suggest. So the sums roughly add up, yes? Well, maybe not. If you actually sit through the 95 minutes of the film, you might ask if the product really cost that much, given its budget feel and the calibre of the script.There are some documents that add weight to such scepticism. The Guardian has seen a spreadsheet of the film’s budget – which contains enough detail to list parking tickets issued to crew members. It also includes hundreds of lines of other costs, such as payments to cast members and a £100,000 fee to Latham, before recording the “grand total” of the film’s budget to be £1.3m. Oddly, that is £3m short of the figure recorded in the published accounts.Separate records from Lloyd’s of London, also seen by the Guardian, appear to show the film was insured based on “estimated gross production costs” of £1.4m. These much smaller figures imply a tax credit due of up to £280,000 – nowhere near the almost £1m of taxpayer support that Companies House accounts set out was claimed – raising questions as to whether the state assistance was almost four times too rich.Gatecrash contains the same subplot. The publicly filed accounts imply a total budget of about £4.5m with claimed tax credits of £868,324 (so, about 19% of the “budget”). Yet one internal document seen by the Guardian – which details costs such as hire fees for “costumes” plus “hair/make up & prosthetics kit” – sets out how the Gatecrash budget totalled £1m. If the document is correct, it would suggest this film was also largely paid for by the exchequer.There is a similar story around Dark Encounter, where the accounts appear to show a £6.6m budget and £1.3m of claimed tax credits. Yet, confusingly, the film’s director, Carl Strathie, has suggested that he was working under much tighter financial constraints, posting on X in 2024 that the budget for the film was only £1.5m.Strathie also stated that another of his films made with Latham – the sci-fi thriller Solis that starred The Walking Dead actor Steven Ogg – cost £700,000 to make and included cost savings such as the spaceship set having pilot seats that were “gaming chairs … put into MDF frames”. That film, which only featured Ogg on screen, was paid £970,000 by the taxpayer on a £5m budget, according to the publicly filed accounts.View image in fullscreenThe film director Carl Strathie on set.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyIf those numbers at Companies House are correct, that appears to have made Solis more costly than a comparable film in the same genre: Sony Pictures’ 2009 low-budget sci-fi film Moon starred the future Oscar winner Sam Rockwell plus the voice of double Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey as an artificial intelligence character. Itcost a reported $5m(£3.8m).Strathie did not respond when approached for comment via his accountants but both of his social media posts appear to have been taken down since the Guardian began asking questions about Latham’s financing.What does remain on the record, however, is how much one of Strathie’s films took at the box office. Dark Encountergrossed a total of $4,672, seemingly exclusively from the United Arab Emirates, according to IMDb.com’s takings analysis service, Box Office Mojo. Meanwhile, none of For Love or Money, Gatecrash or Solis get a mention for box office takings.An unsatisfactory ending?So if the real intrigue in a Latham film is contained within its finances, has anybody tried to account for the apparent discrepancies?In order to be able to keep film tax credits after they have been paid out, a final certificate needs to have been granted by the British Film Institute (BFI). Yet, neither For Love or Money, Gatecrash, Dark Encounter nor Solis have received one,according to the BFI. Meanwhile, Gatecrash Film Ltd – the company behind the picture of the same name – never will get its certificate, having been dissolved in September 2025.A spokesperson for the BFI said: “The BFI has a legal gateway through which we can share information regarding compliance with HMRC and DCMS, and we work closely with them to uphold the integrity of the system.”HMRC did not comment.All of which appears to leave filmgoers with an unsatisfactory finale: if Latham really is the most prolific UK film producer you’ve never heard of, he is also one you never hear from.The Guardian attempted to contact him directly in order to seek comment, as well as via his family and his lawyers. The producer did not respond.Explore more on these topicsFilm industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He’s referring to Withernsea, a faded seaside resort nearHull, where he grew up and then desperately wanted to leave. “I remember feeling so resentful,” he says. “I heard Tracey Chapman’s Fast Car and thought: is this song about me?” He duly got out aged 17, eventually settling in London and finding success as a visual artist and musician.But in recent years, the 46-year-old began hearing younger avant garde musicians “talking about their satellite towns” in other often forgotten corners of the north. “I’d never looked at the north like that, in the way these artists are unravelling these narratives.” Having dabbled in music for decades, he was inspired by these acts to embark on his first serious records, with Withernsea as his muse – finally seeing his old town as “ripe for storytelling”.The artists Culver discovered are a wave of experimentalists writing a new chapter in northern English music – including Preston’sBlackhaine, Bradford’s Iceboy Violet, Huddersfield’sAya, Manchester-based Shell Company and others – with noirish, club-adjacent sounds and confessional lyrics. Frequently collaborating with one another and linked via avant garde music hub the White Hotel in Salford, their roots are in the north’s less spotlit corners, and their inspiration is often drawn from feelings of alienation and boredom. With London receiving more culture funding than the entire north of England (according to think tank IPPR North), many young northern artists beyond the metropolis of Manchester find themselves isolated.“Everybody comes from a place of mundanity, and [is] able to sit with themselves – even sit with horrible thoughts,” says Rainy Miller, an artist from the Lancashire town of Longridge who has worked with and released most of these acts on his Fixed Abode label. He has a name for this phenomenon: the northern gothic.View image in fullscreenSitting with horrible thoughts … Rainy MillerI meet Miller inPreston, and we visit the terraced house where he started Fixed Abode. The day he viewed this house, just prior to the 2020 lockdowns, he had a distressing chance encounter on the street: “I saw my biological father for the first time in 20 years.” The emotional fallout inspired his astonishing, desolate new album Joseph, What Have You Done?, featuring Miller recounting the incident and resulting surge of “rage and hatred for myself” on the track Marked, 2020. Reflecting on family and his small-town upbringing, the album addresses the feeling – screamed on Mud in My Mouth (Predetermined Definitions) – of having been “born to be nothing”.Walking me through Preston’s quiet streets, Miller discusses the northern gothic as a play on the southern gothic literary tradition in the US, with its stories of nowhere towns in the deep south. After Chorley artist Christ the Poet showed Miller the 2003 documentary Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus, focused on the American south, Miller felt a similarity with the northern satellite towns he grew up around: “All these places have so much space and time to stand still.”Like himself, the artists in Fixed Abode’s orbit have largely grown up in these towns. These include his schoolmate, the Preston-born and Chorley-raised rapper-choreographer Blackhaine, who poured his disillusionment into the Miller-produced 2020 EP Armour. “All this pain, I can’t sense it,” Blackhaine raps on motorway ode Black Lights on the M6. Blackhaine went on to do choreography collaborations with Playboi Carti and, pre-cancellation, Kanye West. Miller describes an early session with him, along with Manchester’sSpace Afrika, as being “like I’d walked into the room I was meant to be in”.Rapper and producer Iceboy Violet, who has collaborated with both Miller and Blackhaine, describes a similar upbringing. “The quality I can pick out from my music, that relates to growing up in Halifax, is isolation,” they explain on a call. “I felt quite lonely and misunderstood.” That isolation prompted experiments in production, eventually leading to emotive, abstract records such as 2023’s Not a Dream, But a Controlled Explosion.View image in fullscreen‘I felt quite lonely and misunderstood’ … Iceboy Violet.Photograph: Oliver KGHIceboy Violet’s interest in experimental music connected them with likeminded northern artists, especially after co-founding the club night Mutualism while studying inHuddersfield. An early booking was Aya – whose nightmarish recent album Hexed!reflects on growing up around that same town – leading to a “beautiful friendship”. Relocating to Manchester, Iceboy Violet began visiting the White Hotel, which was “booking the exact type of acts I wanted to see and maybe nobody else wanted to”. Befriending other regulars, they began playing there frequently, culminating in Mutualism’s recent 10th birthday celebrations, with Iceboy Violet and Aya taking to the decks. “Someone started chanting ‘friendship’, and the whole club joined in.”I head to the White Hotel the next day. A former auto-repair workshop on a Salford industrial estate, since 2015 the club has gathered fans of extreme, boundary-pushing music under the giant white metal cross in its centre. Every act I have named has played here. I bump into Miller, who I’d last seen here DJing with Iceboy Violet during one of the club’s midnight-7am parties. Tonight it’s a seated crowd for spoken-word artist Rosabella Allen, who is knelt over CDJs on the stage’s floor and looping her voice over dark, woozy beats. She is also the vocalist in another Fixed Abode alumnus: Manchester-formed post-rock trio Shell Company.Shell Company cite lockdown as another influence on this wave of experimental music. “Living in the north of England in 2020 during lockdown has this very specific set of social things going on, which mean there’s going to be a dark element to it,” the group’s Chris Banks says. A 2021 report by the Northern Health Science Alliance found that lockdowns hit the north of England much harder than the south, in terms of fatalities, mental health and unemployment. Banks’s brother Rob also suggests the lockdowns are a reason why “there’s a lot of influence from club electronics, without it really being music for a dancefloor”. Allen describes their darkly beautiful new EP Locket as dealing with “loneliness and isolation”, though the track Salt Fields features a friend – Richie Culver.“I look up to all the people you’ve mentioned,” Culver says. Sitting in his studio in north-west London, we are surrounded by his strange, dark creations. There are paintings of disfigured faces, leather strapping mounted to canvases, and the piece that inspired I Trust Pain track Nothing: a huge white sheet with the words “born” and “died” crossed out. Reaching out to Blackhaine in the lockdowns, Culver began a series of collaborations with artists in this orbit, setting the tone for his 2022 debut album I Was Born by the Sea.I Trust Pain is a definitive northern gothic album. Its mix of witchy trap, spoken-word and dreary ambient – featuring some production by Miller and Blackhaine, and influenced by Culver’s industrial beat-making under the name Quiet Husband – focuses on Withernsea. He flipped the childhood escape fantasy he had with Chapman’s Fast Car into last year’s Slow Car, his deep voice whispering “You’re never gonna leave”, and those feelings are also on the new album. “It’s just me alone by the seaside,” he raps on North Sea Calls, “hiding from the nothing that’s coming my way.”A photo from outside his childhood home hangs on one of the studio walls, of a lone caravan on a featureless slope. “There’s nothing like an English seaside town in January and February – the morbidness and heaviness of that,” Culver says. While the area has a history of experimental music, with industrial pioneers Throbbing Gristle forming in Hull, the artist felt culturally isolated. “There was zero for me, if you wanted to be a weirdo and be around weirdos.”‘Chasing a high through rave music got dark’: Aya on hexes, Huddersfield and her hardcore horror electronicsRead moreHowever, he says, “those 17 years made me the artist and musician I am, and gave me a story to tell.” Gratitude is certainly present in I Trust Pain’s mixed feelings about Withernsea, interwoven with reflections on relationships and old regrets: “I guess sometimes when you’re in it and living it, it’s hard to see how beautiful it actually is,” he recites on near-ballad Some Stories Linger.“I’ve spent my whole life overthinking things, and trying to be something I’m not by coming to London,” Culver says. This record seems to have helped process those feelings, thanks to the kindred spirits in northern experimental music that inspired him to try. “I’d never heard anybody make the north sound so cool, and poetic.”I Trust Pain is on Fixed AbodeExplore more on these topicsExperimental musicElectronic musicManchesterHuddersfieldHullPrestonSalfordfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He’s a chip off baseball’s Mount Olympus, the 18-year-old top draft pick who appeared all but destined to take his place alongside Babe Ruth, Ted Williams and other immortals of the game when he broke into the majors in 1994. And while Rodriguez distinguished himself as a Willie Mays-grade offensive demon and one of the best infielders who ever lived, he played under the stress of the game’s richest contract (infamously, he signed fora record $252minthe year 2000) and under the harsh glare of the New York media spotlight after joining the Yankees in 2004; to meet the pressure, he turned to performance-enhancing drugs – a cardinal sin in the sport – and was ultimately banished from baseball’s hallowed pantheon.Alex Rodriguez: ‘If you can’t sell Aaron Judge, you can’t sell anyone’Read moreWorse, Rodriguez lied about doping after getting caughttwice (the first time before there was an explicit major league policy against PEDs), shattering trust with baseball fans who eventually came to see him as a classic narcissist – albeit one who has been linked to Madonna and JLo and was alleged to have a painting of himself as a centaur hanging over his bed. (He candeny that, but not the Details magazine photo of himkissing his mirror image.) Sadly, Rodriguez’s present-day reinvention at age 50 intoa Bloomberg TV thought leaderand part-owner of the NBA’s Minnesota Timberwolves has done little to sway an American public that still feels badly burnt by him.Film-maker Gotham Chopra, a lifelong fan of the Yankees archrival Boston Red Sox, was inclined to continue thinking the worst of Rodriguez when intermediaries for the three-time MVP approached him about the possibility of collaborating for a documentary similar in style to the deep dives Chopra has done onKobe BryantandTom Bradyunder his Religion of Sports production imprint.And then Chopra met A-Rod for lunch. “All of a sudden he’s going from talking about Basquiat to the concept of blind spots and how he never quite figured that out off the field until he started going to therapy,” he says. “I didn’t get the impression that this was him pitching himself. I was impressed – like,Oh, there’s something here.”That meeting turned out to be the kernel for Alex vs ARod, a three-part docuseries that Chopra directed and executive-produced with longtime collaborator Erik LeDrew for HBO; the network has a sterling reputation for making not just quality docs, but qualitybaseballdocs – from Nine Innings from Ground Zero to Charlie Hustle & the Matter of Pete Rose. (Which is to say the directors felt no pressure to make a film for entertainment’s sake.) Alex vs ARod is less a celebration of Rodriguez’s on-field exploits and post-retirement success than an interrogation of his drug sins against baseball and his impetus to deceive the public.Chopra didn’t just bringhisfan skepticism to the project; LeDrew, a Seattle Mariners fan, started out resenting Rodriguez’s poster-boy status in middle school before writing him off altogether when Rodriguez spurned Seattle to sign that record contract with the Texas Rangers. (“Everycute girl had his picture on theirTrapper Keeper,” LeDrew says.) The directors knew they would be in for a fight with Rodriguez – who, ever the disciplined hitter, would just foul off the questions he didn’t like until his challengers served up softballs in frustration – and roped in SNL’s Lindsay Shookus (an executive producer here) for help interviewing the pinstripes star.After three years of hounding, the longest Chopra and LeDrew have spent on a documentary project, they forge a bit of daylight between Rodriguez the man and the mythical A-Rod persona. The directors wear Rodriguez down until he finally comes clean about why he kept lying about his PED use and went to war withMajor League Baseballafter being slapped with a 211-game suspension. (Though later reduced to 162 games, the penalty hastened the end of Rodriguez’s career.) And it turns out that Rodriguez has just been overcompensating for his father abandoning him young.The third episode of Alex vs ARod doesn’t just have Rodriguez explain how he arrived at this breakthrough; it follows him through shin-high snow as he treks back to the home office of star therapist David Schnarch – whose 2020 death clearly smarts, still. “He was such a truth teller, and I wasn’t used to that,” Rodriguez says. “In hindsight, I was so fucking slippery.” Rodriguez literally reconstructs his sessions with Schnarch, toggling the counselor and patient roles to show how hard it was for him to accept his father as anything other than the man who seeded his love for baseball. “Having a present father would’ve definitely helped me avoid some of the dumbass decisions that I made,” he says at one point.With that as a frame, it’s easier to understand how Rodriguez could be so driven by success, so consumed by being “the provider” in his family and so scared of the prospect of lettinganyonedown that he would do anything to avoid that fate – breadcrumbs that are laid in the earlier episodes. (“He loved to please,” Lou Pinella, Rodriguez’s first big league manager, says in episode one.) Rodriguez’s daddy issues make for an evenmorestark comparison with Derek Jeter – the Yankees standard bearer who had his father to guide him every step of the way. “It may sound trite and cliche to say,Oh, he didn’t have a father,” LeDrew says. “But there’s a lot of complexity in those six words, a lifetime’s worth.”Adds Chopra: “I work really closely with Tom Brady [a Religion of Sports co-founder], and there’s not a moment that goes by where he’s not tracing his success back to his relationship with his father – not really just on the football field, but in terms of his confidence and emotional stability and stuff like that. I don’t know Derek very well, but you get that impression as well. With those guys, for the most part, it wasn’t just the success on the field. They handled themselves so well off the field. And think that came from this acceptance that they had, whereas Alex didn’t have that. He’s always trying to prove it.”Jeter, who touches on athlete father-son dynamics in the doc, is prominent in a lineup of expert A-Rod witnesses that also includes sports talk radio institution Mike Francesa and Rodriguez’s ex-wife, Cynthia – who initially did not want to be interviewed and definitely lives up to hertabloid villainy. (“I feel sorry for him,” was her first impression of Rodriguez, who struck her as stunted when it came to “the natural development of a person”.) But the genuine surprise is Katie Couric, who anchors much of episode two with breaking news of her unlikely friendship with Rodriguez; it started out with him bombing her with attention at a Yankees game on the way to cultivating her as a confidante, weirdly. Couric says Rodriguez told her that he felt she was the only person he could trust – which is crazy coming from a guy who was teammates with Ken Griffey Jr, a baseball superstar who could actually relate.View image in fullscreenAlex Rodriguez in 2004.Photograph: Gregory Bull/APIt really loads the musket for what happens next: Rodriguez lying about his PED useto Couric’s facein a 60 Minutes interviewafter a number of his former teammates were named inthe seminal Mitchell reportlinking MLB players to steroid use amid a congressional inquiry. “That just came out in the interview,” LeDrew says. “Alex hadn’t even told us anything like that. It’s not like anybody is calling him up like, ‘Hey we’re gonna interview this person, what do you think?’ That’s the beauty of documentary. If you’re really attuned to the subject matter and have the discipline to be patient, you can strike gold.” Tellingly, former baseball commissioner Bud Selig and longtime A-Rod agent Scott Boras declined interview invitations – but you don’t really miss them much, or the lack of dirt on Rodriguez’s brief engagement to JLo. (They broke up in 2021, after four years together.)Of course there will be those who view Alex v ARod more cynically, as a selfish quest for a bronze plaque. Rodriguez has been eligible for induction in the Baseball Hall of Fame since 2022 – and like most of his cohort from the steroid era, he has thus far fallen short of the required number of votes. But since sports have sold out to big gambling, big pharma and other imminent threats to the integrity of competition, it’s tough to imagine baseball maintaining the high ground on Rodriguez’s enshrinement for much longer. He was undeniably greatbeforethedrugs and could probably get more credit formoving to third basewith the Yankees so Jeter, the team captain, could remain at shortstop – even though Rodriguez was better suited for that position and a vastly more talented player. Rodriguez was integral to the Yankees’ 2009 World Series run. Really, he only damaged himself with his doping in the end.The thing that truly sets Rodriguez apart from defiant juicers likeBarry Bonds, though, is that he at least fessed up to his mistakes and did the self-excavating work to understand where he went wrong. You can see some of the payoff when he’s hosting his daughters and ex-wife for Thanksgiving – a genuinely cozy scene that would seem to speak to Rodriguez’s core goodness. “He had them all at his house, including Cynthia, her current husband and their daughter, Angel, for a week,” LeDrew says. “It’s something they do every year. I thought that would be interesting to show knowing the baggage, a lot of it public, behind him and Cynthia. The fact that they are good friends, and not just for the sake of their daughters. But I give Alex huge credit. He did call her and tell her, ‘Tell the truth.’ We actually interviewed Cynthia before we interviewed Alex.”Nearly as stunning as that family portrait is Rodriguez admitting in the doc that he’s approaching the point of appreciating how it took him messing up his career to fix his life. He calls himself a “recovering narcissist”. It’s hard not to take him at his word. “It was hard work getting him to talk so honestly about so many of these things,” Chopra says. “But he’s really done the work. He’s earned this.”Alex vs A-Rod premieres on 6 November on HBO with a UK date to be announcedExplore more on these topicsDocumentaryAlex RodriguezFactual TVTelevisionHBOBaseballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s like we’re not even supposed to be angry. But I could eat this podium with a fork and fucking knife, I’m so angry.”Stewart spent eight years trying to get her passion project – an adaptation of Lidia Yuknavitch’s 2011 memoir, The Chronology of Water – off the ground. The film, which stars Imogen Poots,premiered at Cannes in Mayand is shortly to be released in the US.Stewart began her speech crediting Yuknavitch as a key inspiration and saying her memoir gave “voice to certain truths I inherently understood”.“Hard truths, when spoken out loud, become springboards to freedom,” Stewart said. “The permission to be unpalatable, unsanitary, and to come from the inside out … led me to acknowledge the invisible cage that we are all living in and how easy it is to story our way out there.”Stewart said that women’s voices appeared to have gained more traction since #MeToo, but that the industry was still afraid of unsanitised stories. “I can now attest to the bare-knuckle brawling that it takes every step of the way when the content is too dark, too taboo,” she said. “Our business,” she continued, “is in a state of emergency.“We are allowed to be proud of ourselves,” said Stewart. “But let’s try not to be tokenised. Let’s start printing our own currency.”“I am so for you,” she concluded. “I hope you are too. Let’s make art in the face of it.”Attendees at the event included Tessa Thompson, Kate Hudson, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Claire Foy, Kerry Condon, Patty Jenkins, and Emma Mackey. Also speaking at the forum was costume designer Ruth Carter, who in 2023 becamethe first black woman to win two Oscars.Carter paid tribute to her college professor, as well as the directors Spike Lee and John Singleton, “who gave me room to learn and grow – that’s what mentorship and fellowship do. They say to every woman film-maker and artist: We see you. We believe in you. You belong here.”In 2023, the number of women who directed the top-grossing US films declined slightly, from 18% to 16%, while in the UK, some 13% of directors of all films were women.In Europe, the number is believed to be a little higher, at around 23%, across all films.A study published last year founda “catastrophic” 10-year lowfor on screen female representation in film, with only 30 of the US’s top 100 films led or co-led by women, down from 44 in 2022.This was despite the $1.4bn success of Barbie, Greta Gerwig’s comedy starring Margot Robbie. This season, the two women who have previously won the best director Oscar – Chloé Zhao and Kathryn Bigelow, are believed to be frontrunners to take the prize again at next year’s ceremony, for their films Hamnet and A House of Dynamite.Explore more on these topicsKristen StewartFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

For more than 200 years, the British Museum in London has proudly displayed the marbles – and done very decent educational and curatorial work while gradually registering awareness that this is stolen property. Lord Elgin effectively plundered these artefacts and his supposed purchase of them could hardly be seen as anything more than a bribe, especially as the permission document or “firman” from the then controlling Ottoman empire is missing and exists only in highly suspect manuscript translations. But no British politician wants to get involved, suspecting that it means nothing but trouble. Keir Starmer is very unlikely to hand his rightwing opponents a fresh new weapon in the culture war.Wilkinson entertainingly recounts Elgin’s arrogance and also puts before us the new context of museum restitution where institutions are restoring contested items, especially in Scotland, which leads the way in this movement. Campaigner and actor Brian Cox tells Wilkinson that if the marbles had found their way to Edinburgh and not London they would have gone back to Athens a long time ago. He could be right. Furthermore, there are new imaginative avenues of thinking: digital and virtual reality displays of the marbles and how they would have looked in the Acropolis could in theory be mounted at theBritish Museum.The director is also generous and open-minded in allowing the pro-British argument an airing: the suggestion that museum culture is international and it is regressive and nativist to bring the marbles over toGreece. Yet here is my one small complaint about this film; or rather, a question that isn’t asked or answered here. Given that the aesthetic point is so important, that these marbles were part of an artistic whole within the Acropolis, isn’t it disconcerting that they would not be reaffixed but simply placed in another museum near the Acropolis (and one that incidentally charges €20 a ticket, as opposed to free admission at the British Museum)? Well, for all that, this is a thoughtful and considered case for their homecoming.The Marbles is in UK and Irish cinemas from 7 NovemberExplore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsParthenon marblesBritish MuseumGreeceEuropeHeritagereviewsShareReuse this content"

It seems to be the place on everyone’s lips, the megalopolis at the centre of contemporary conversation, endlessly and casually invoked as the epitome of heartless capitalism and reactionary politics, a city beyond irony or principled objection. And yet, until now, I don’t think I have seen a film try to show what this extraordinary place actually looks like, with woozy, dreamy, narcotically Ballardian and surreal images of this cityscape in the desert.Colossal Wreck, with its reference to Shelley that is made explicit at the end, is Appignanesi’s own wryly thoughtful account of his visit to Dubai in 2023, to present a screening ofhis previous film My Extinctionat the28th UN Climate Change Conference, or Cop28, which was, with staggering effrontery, being staged by a massive oil-producing nation whose politicians thought nothing of actually making discreet oil deals at the conference itself. The film is wonderfully written and mesmerically scored by composer Vik Sharma and narrated off camera by Appignanesi – or rather, it seems, by an AI voice clone. (I had thought that Appignanesi was speaking metaphorically about this fabrication of his speaking self but no, it is literal AI.) And so his physical presence, generally one of genial dishevelment, is largely absent, which has the result of increasing the film’s sense of seriousness.There werecalamitous flash-flood disasters in Dubaibefore and after the conference, but while Appignanesi was there everything was eerie perfection, an uncanny valley of hyper-prosperous consumerist placidity. Appignanesi is too discreet and high-minded to say it, but Dubai and its Expo City are, simply, film-making gold: everywhere you point your camera – or, for that matter, iPhone – presents an amazing spectacle. It is like a city-state-sized airport duty free shop crossed with a Kubrickian spaceship. Appignanesi introduces My Extinction and gamely participates in a Q&A afterwards to a modest audience. (He drolly records his resentment of the greater audience and industry support for Josh Tickell, another film-maker there.) And he also shows us an indigenous speaker from Brazil’s Guarani people, Valdelice Veron, speaking with passion about her people being wiped out, the documentary’s one moment of un-anaesthetised emotion.The film allows us to ponder the single, ridiculous subject: what on earth is everyone else doing here? The activists are massively outnumbered by the bankers and the fossil-fuel shills who are solemnly here to hide their raison d’etre in plain sight. The keynote is that floating, outer-space sensation of something very strange indeed: a message from the future. We see the vista of Dubai and its towers (Appignanesi calls them “gargantua of insignificance”) from the top of the world’s tallest building to the disquietingly beautiful accompaniment of whale song. Could something positive emerge, almost by accident, from this circus? Or is humanity more than half in love with its own extinction, addicted as it is to the business of living and using everything up? (I personally don’t think this is the case.) But this is Appignanesi’s best documentary yet.Colossal Wreck is in UK cinemas from 7 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsCop28DubaireviewsShareReuse this content"

The Good Wife’s Cush Jumbo is our narrator, steering the story alongside a cast including Hugh Laurie as venerable wizard-in-chief Albus Dumbledore; Michelle Gomez as Professor McGonagall; Riz Ahmed as Professor Snape; Mark Addy as Hagrid; Matthew Macfadyen as Lord Voldemort; and newcomers Frankie Treadaway, Max Lester and Arabella Stanton as young wizards Harry, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.With a TV adaptation currently in production courtesy of HBO, a new audio series might seem superfluous. But there is much to enjoy in this unabridged version which feels fresh, lively and well-paced. Gomez’s imperious Professor McGonagall is a match for the late Maggie Smith in the films, while Laurie is full of twinkly mischief as Dumbledore. And as we’ve come to expect from these big-budget productions, the sound design is excellent, replicating the whoosh of an owl coming in to land and the chug and whistle of the Hogwarts Express as it wends its way through the countryside, carrying Harry and his cohorts towards a magical adventure.Available via Audible 8hr 41minFurther listeningI Want to Talk to You: And Other ConversationsDiana Evans, Penguin Audio, 8hr 30minA collection of 30 nonfiction works spanning 20 years by the Ordinary People author.

Powerful stuff.Of course, that record wouldn’t be everyone’s choice, so we asked readers to tell us which 90s club tracks they would pass on to the next generation. Here are some of them.Breathe - The ProdigyBreathe by The Prodigy is like a shot of adrenaline to an ailing, middle aged body. This was proven to mytwentysomething son a few years ago, when he saw what happens to a room full of us when the bass kicks in. We saw them at the Brighton Centre, sadly without Keith. The Fat of the Land came out the month after my son was born, so he’s been listening to The Prodigy all his life. He used to fall asleep to that album and he still loves 90s dance, Fat of the Land being one of his favourites. He was intrigued with the crab on the album cover too, and for many years referred to the CD as “Crab” whenever we played it.Miranda Diboll, 50, Seaford, East SussexThe Real Thing – Tony Di BartThe song is about a genuine connection, rather than artificial stuff. What I love about this track is the melody, taking me back straight to mid-90s, when as a teenager I’d been going to raves and techno parties, getting lost in the music and living my, then,best life with no real responsibilities. Now, whenever I hear it, I focus more on the lyrics and their meaning. “I’ve been looking for the real thing”, and “If I can’t have you, I don’t want nobody”. As a 43-year-old and a father to three kids, I do appreciate the true, real connection we are building rather than the artificial world of social media we so often find ourselves in.Michael, 43, HampshireHi-Tech Jazz – Galaxy 2 GalaxyOutsider’s choice: Hi-Tech Jazz by Galaxy 2 Galaxy. It’s one of the best Detroit techno tracks ever written – actually, one of the best, full stop. The next generation need to know the legacy of Underground Resistance and what is possible to achieve when making electronic music. I think there are several producers who encompass this, but for me none more important than Mad Mike and Underground Resistance. Their music couldn’t be pigeonholed, and showed that machine music could have as much soul as anything produced by a singer or a band.Dan Gilbert, 54, LondonBack in the UK (full length version) – ScooterNot only is this track stupidly fun, with the spoken intro – “Welcome to the past, the present and the future … it’s 6am and we find ourselves somewhere in England …” – but also it samples the US Miss Marple theme, which was penned by Ron Goodwin – who composed classics like 633 Squadron and Where Eagles Dare. Mad to think Back in the UK is 30 years old.Em Jackson, NewcastleBorn Slippy – UnderworldBorn Slippy by Underworld is utterly symbolic of what a night out with friends used to be, before all the responsibilities of being an adult. Up to and including standing, arms around your friends – either long term or recently met – shouting: “Lager, lager, lager”, there was nothing like it. I recently played it for my nine and 10-year-old and they both said “yeah, this is pretty good”. Which, for my two, is a glowing review.Jay, 50, The Wirral, MerseysideLamborghini – Shut Up and Dance (feat Ragga Twins)I remember in 1992, at the Soas student union (I was at LSE, but spent a lot of time at their union bar), the Ragga Twins were let down by a really poor sound system, but they cracked on, and kept it real! Even with the limitations, when they threw down Shut Up and Dance. It made us all complicit in something real, raw and special. Hence to my kids: be yourself and keep it authentic. You will prevail.Richard, 53, HertfordLFO – LFOLFO by LFO isn’t the best dance track ever, but I played this when I bought my daughter her first decent Bluetooth speaker. I’m not sure if it was the rattling windows around the house or that she enjoyed the music, but she is now a house head and wants me to take her to Ibiza again next year. It’s a superb example of bleep techno. Simple melody, quite repetitive with amazing bass and it’s great to dance to. Ideal to remix or edit.David Bradbury, Bury St EdmundsExplore more on these topicsDance musicClub cultureJohn Lewis Christmas adfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Living through that period has felt like moving further and faster into the future that their songs often sounded so worried about. Animal-borne diseases and invading armies, bomb shelters and endless rainstorms, falling skies and collapsing infrastructure – ’twas all foretold in the lyric sheets of the ever-fretfulThom Yorke.His reputation as a soothsayer has probably been overstated as the band’s myth has grown in their absence, but if the frontman is a genius (the jury is still out and may never come back in, their verdict deferred more by politics than musicianship) then he’s hardly the only monumental talent in the lineup. For all the brilliant records Yorke has made lately, including several with bandmate Jonny Greenwood intheir looser-limbed trio the Smile,the faithful have been holding out a geological age to see the full five back together.Radiohead’s 2025 tour: the opening night setlistRead moreNow, without much warning, nor any particular reason, nor any new music to sell us (that we know of), they have returned to playshort residencies in a few European cities. Performing in the round, they take and switch positions behind a gossamer projection screen that initially seems like some kind of shield. As it turns out, no such protection is needed. This is not a fragile re-emergence.“Shell smashed, juices flowing,” sings Yorke on opener Let Down, and it makes sense that they would start again with that one. A deep cut fromOK Computerthat has long been a fan favourite, its recent adoption by teens on TikTok gave the band their closest thing to a big hit this century. Gorgeous, oddly weightless, gently self-mocking – Yorke’s mordant joking about his own tendency towards maudlin “drivel” might be as under-recognised as Kafka’s – it strikes a peculiar note of hope-against-doubt, bequeathed from gen X to gen Z.On this outing, the shimmer of the vocal and Greenwood’s curious guitar melody (played in a different time signature to the other instruments) are given colossal oomph by an almost overpowering rhythm section. This sets the tone for the night, too, as the top end sometimes suffers from the cavern effect common to arenas of this size, while drummer Phil Selway, auxiliary percussionist Chris Vatalaro, and Jonny’s bassist brother Colin compensate with a stunning show of force on mid-to-late career tracks 2+2=5, Bloom and Ful Stop.The elder Greenwood has always been Radiohead’s secret weapon, his manner suggesting the offer of a nice cuppa while his playing can range from loverman soulfulness to borderline brutality. His basslines have walked the listener through the most forbidding passages of their studio material and tonight’s selections from Kid A – Everything In Its Right Place, Idioteque – complete their 25-year transition from icy sonic shocks to crowd-pleasing, floor-filling heaters.By 15 Step even the upper tiers of seated sections are bouncing like babies to those tricky drum patterns while Yorke reminds them that “it comes to us all”, whatever “it” is. Old age … or death, most likely. Yorke is almost 60 now and spry as hell, but also grey-bearded as a sea dog while he dances little jigs around the deck to The National Anthem and its stupidly great bassline, which he apparently wrote when he was 16.Radiohead play career-spanning set in first concert since 2018Read moreYorke has always kept one eye on the prancing spectres of elders like Mick Jagger, and one ear out for the sound of legacy acts spinning their wheels. That is absolutely not how Radiohead come across here. Their fanbase is more prone to purism and perversity than others, maybe, and some will inevitably quibble about the relative lack of choice picks from albums A Moon Shaped Pool or The Bends, though beloved early-ish single Fake Plastic Trees “blows through the ceiling” on that line much more explosively than on the recorded version.In the past, live performance has expressed Radiohead’s clear relief at being out of the studio, and alleviated of the compositional pressure that seemed to almost wreck them every time. Their energy tonight might mean something else, but the relief is surely felt by anyone who ever loved this band – it’s not just fun, it’s an absolute joy. Yorke, for his part, says little other than “gracias”. There are many who feel he should have said a lot more, anda lot louder, in recent years. And there are others who remember well the nervy young guy who seemed so freaked out by the speed and direction of our supposed progress back in the early days of the iMac, who would still elect him as the very fellow to sing to us in our present state of terminal velocity.The setlistLet Down2 + 2 = 5Sit Down.

She talks about female anger, becoming cool at 82 – and why winning made her feel like a stunned mulletWed 5 Nov 2025 08.16 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 14.48 ESTShareWhen Helen Garner was announced asthe winnerof the Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction in London on Tuesday night, the 82-year-old Australian author was 16,000kmaway in Melbourne, watching the ceremony on a live stream at home on what was for her Wednesday morning. When the big moment came, she heard “the winner is …” and then the feed froze. “We were going, ‘Oh God!’ Running around. We didn’t know what to do. The timing was like something in a comedy.” Congratulations immediately rushed in, which is how she knew she’d won the £50,000 (A$100,000) prize forHow to End a Story, an 800-page collection of her astoundingly frank diaries, kept between 1978 and 1998.Garner is still grappling with her win when we speak a few hours later. “I’m a stunned mullet,” she says, sitting in her study, wrapped in a lilac shawl and with glasses on a cord around her neck. “I didn’t think I had a chance.” She has absolutely no idea what she said in her thank you speech: “I think I’m in shock.”In her 80s, Garner is experiencing a career high. After decades of being ignored overseas, “Australia’s Joan Didion” has become cool. Carrie Bradshaw recently toted a hardback of Garner’s debut novel,Monkey Grip, in an episode of And Just Like That as if it were a must-have purse,while Dua Lipa (“a complete sweetheart”) picked Garner’s accountof a murder trial,This House of Grief, for her enormously popularbook club. Garner is “thrilled to bits” by all of this. “My street cred has gone through the roof!” she laughs.View image in fullscreen‘She’s a complete sweetheart’ … Dua Lipa poses with a copy of This House of Grief.Photograph: Permanent Press MediaWhen Monkey Grip was published in 1977, Australian critics were dismissive, even outraged, by its clear autobiographical inspirations. “Helen Garner has published her private journal rather than written a novel,” one sniffed. It was a charge Garner could hardly deny, having spent months drawing from her diaries to write its story of the love affair between a divorced single mother and a heroin addict in Melbourne.“Although it was true, I huffily defended myself against that claim, because it rests upon the idea that writing a diary is sloppy,” she says. “That it is just some sludgy flow of feminine whinging that comes out of a woman and she writes it down and calls it a book. I was enraged on a deep level by the suggestion that diaries were muck and not worthy of people’s attention. Now I’m happy to say that Monkey Grip was based on my diaries.”Almost 50 years later, she is winning acclaim and prizes for publishing her actual diaries. She loves that How to End a Story has won a prize for nonfiction, a term normally reserved for grander histories: “The fact that my diaries were flung into that big category called nonfiction – I thought, ‘Hooray! They found a home.’”How to End a Story is really three volumes, starting after the birth of her daughter Alice (M in the diaries) and her divorce from her first husband, Bill Garner. The first (1978-1987) opens just after Monkey Grip was published and maps out the collapse of her second marriage, to Frenchman Jean-Jacques Portail. The second (1987-1995) finds her beginning an affair with the (married) Australian novelist Murray Bail, while the third (1995-1998) charts the end of their marriage – her third and final. (She has been happily divorced ever since.)The Garner of the diaries seems so far away from the grande dame of today. She is nervy and weepy, desperate for praise and scorchingly self-critical. “I will never be a great writer,” she writes in one entry. “The best I can do is to write books that are small but oblique enough to stick in people’s gullets so that they remember them.” But she is also great company: observant and smart, able to find beauty in the smallest of moments. “Spring night: black sky speckled with stars, air cool and thickly scented with grass, and the odours of things growing.” And humour too: “At the hippies’ house for dinner, I find in my slice of quiche two foreign items: a dead match and a pubic hair. I hide them under a lettuce leaf and we go on talking.” She puts words to even her strangest impulses; after seeing a peacock “preening like a Brazilian drag queen”, she fights “a powerful urge to run out there and sink the toe of my boot into his fluffy arse”.View image in fullscreenThe cover of How to End a Story.Photograph: Text PublishingAlmost every reviewer has noted the ferocity of Garner’s anger on the page – towards husbands, bad friends, some children, complete strangers. “Anger is often very shameful for women,” Garner tells me. “I never feel surprised when I read about a woman murdering a man,” she adds, offering a glimpse of the writer who has haunted so many Australian courtrooms over the years – she is about to publish a book on the mushroom murder trial. “I have noticed and understood just how much we have to cop in order to live a peaceful life. Sometimes, a woman will just snap. I figure that they wouldn’t if we didn’t have to crush the anger and pretend it’s not happening.”For Garner, writing a diary is an “intellectually and psychologically serious” exercise; she probes her own behaviour and thoughts, and tests the limits of her observation skills. They are also technically serious, “a sort of daily practice”, she says, for all of the books that were released around them.For years, her novels were seen as too domestic to be significant, while her nonfiction featured too much of herself to be objective. She is sure much of this was sexism. “Back in the 70s, women writers were always criticised for being too narrow and, looking back, too personal. But people didn’t actually say that – we were ‘small canvas’. Everybody had to be writing four-generation family sagas. People don’t talk like that any more. And if they do, they don’t have any power.”But by the 2010s, Garner was a national treasure at home. Her Australian publisher Text even put hershopping listonline because so many readers said they would literally read anything she wrote. When publishing her diaries was first floated, Garner’s initial thought was, “There’s no way I’d do that.” She had actually destroyed her first diaries, burning a pile in her back yard in Fitzroy North in the 1980s: “I thought, these are really trashy, they’re boring and shit, so I’m going to burn them.”But when she revisited the later diaries and realised they were interesting and written carefully, she set herself some rules: she would edit out “the boring stuff, the day’s residue”, but she would not rewrite entries. She contacted friends and family to warn them if they appeared. “Other people I did not consult because I thought they had it coming, to put it crudely,” she says. Names would be changed, she wrote, and if anyone wanted to see the entries they were in, they could: “I wasn’t exactly asking permission but, if somebody really, really didn’t want me to say something, I wouldn’t. But I was very happy that a lot of people wrote back and said, ‘I trust you.’ That was a wonderful moment for me.”View image in fullscreen‘Anger is often very shameful for women’: Helen Garner.Photograph: Charlie KinrossGarner likes her diaries more than anything else she has written. “I feel free when I’m writing in it. I’m not writing to please anybody else, I don’t have a deadline and I can say things in there that I wouldn’t say elsewhere.” Though, she adds, “There are things I don’t put in my diaries, now I’ve got the reputation for publishing them – I suppose some people must quake in their boots.”She still keeps one today, scratching away with a fountain pen while sitting in bed first thing in the morning or last thing at night. Her subjects have changed since her last published volume: her three grandchildren, who have lived next door all their lives and make many entertaining cameos in Garner’s writing, are now all over 18. “My years of being a hands-on nanna are over, to my great sadness,” Garner says. “So my life is different and my diary is different.”She is also noticing signs of cognitive decline. “I’m starting to forget a lot of things,” she says. Her mother died of Alzheimer’s at 82, and she worries about “cracking up”. Some words take longer to come. “But the most annoying thing is, I make spelling mistakes now,” she says. “I’m fanatical about spelling and punctuation. And now I flip back and think, ‘What isthatword?’”But she is still Helen Garner; even her own ageing is something to observe forensically. “I find it very interesting,” she muses. “I actually feel that I am old now. I’ll be 83 this week and I don’t know how much longer I’ve got.” Regardless of whether there are any more books in her, she will continue writing her diaries until the day she dies. “I can’t imagine finding life boring,” she says, with a small, satisfied smile. “The world around me is so interesting. There is always something to write about, so I’ll keep going.”How to End a Story: Collected Diaries by Helen Garner is published by Wiedenfeld & Nicolson in the UK (£30) and by Text Publishing in Australia (A$59.99).

From 1963 to 1970, the group’s four members experienced an entirely new kind of fame, while leaning on each other to get through it. After splitting up, they faced another unprecedented challenge: how to be an ex-Beatle? This one had to be confronted alone.The heaviest burdens of expectation fell on the group’s main songwriters, John Lennon and Paul McCartney, who were also suffering from the emotional shock of an acrimonious personal split. Both of them leaned on their wives. As John and Yoko Ono pursued political campaigns and avant-garde art projects, Paul andLinda McCartneyretreated with their children to their ramshackle Scottish farm, where Paul licked his wounds, sheared sheep and tinkered with new songs. Paul insisted that Linda become his new musical partner, despite her inexperience. As she said later: “The whole thing started because Paul had nobody to play with. More than anything he wanted a friend near him.” The album he made with her, Ram, sold well but received savage reviews, deepening his crisis of confidence.McCartney yearned to play before audiences again, which he hadn’t since the Beatles stopped touring in 1966. But he couldn’t face doing it solo, the spotlight trained on him alone. So he asked Linda to help him put together a new group. This authorised, illustrated oral history, edited by cultural historian Ted Widmer, tells the story ofone of the most successful bands of the 1970s – and one of the strangest.It’s based on interviews (given for a new documentary on the band) with McCartney and former band members, as well as archive material. Widmer does an expert job of stitching this into a compelling narrative that includes cultural context – like what else was in the charts at the time – and plenty of photographs, many previously unseen. The result is a portal into a more eccentric age of pop, a fable about the tension between celebrity and creativity, and a story with elements of Spinal Tap and Wacky Races.The personnel of Wings varied over the decade around a core of Paul, Linda and Denny Laine, formerly of the Moody Blues. The group did not soar effortlessly to high altitude because of McCartney’s fame. In fact, determined to remake himself after the Beatles, he waged a kind of guerrilla campaign against his own celebrity. In 1972, he said: “A year ago, I used to wake up in the morning and think, I’mPaul McCartney. I’m a myth. And it scared the hell out of me.” The first Wings album, Wild Life, released in 1971, was almost deliberately half-baked, and arrived to another round of jeers.View image in fullscreenPaul and Linda McCartney on their Scottish farm.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesMcCartney then instigated one of the most bizarre episodes in the history of rock and pop, packing the other members of Wings into a battered van, along with his children and his sheepdog Martha, and driving them on an unplanned tour of British universities. He would look at the map, identify the nearest university, find the student union, and ask an open-mouthed social secretary if they fancied a gig that evening.For 50p, anyone who wanted could come and see Paul McCartney lead his new group through a ragged set of rock’n’roll covers, new Wings songs, and no Beatles songs. They stayed in grubby little hotels and bed and breakfasts, as if McCartney wanted to recreate the discomfit and squalor of his pre-fame tours with the Beatles. He said: “If we do it this way, the old-fashioned way from square one, there will come a day when we’ll be at square one hundred.”He also wanted Wings to make its mistakes away from the scouring gaze of critics, conscious, in particular, that they would give his wife no quarter. Linda was struggling to learn keyboard and vocal parts, duties she had accepted reluctantly. Her unpolished but affecting singing voice, which blends beautifully with those of Paul and Laine, is now recognised as a crucial component of the Wings sound. But at the time she was bullied and abused for her presumption, a victim of the peculiarly intense vituperation reserved for Beatles’ wives.McCartney, a more oddball artist than his reputation suggested, was a wayward decision-maker. His new group’s first two singles were a protest song (Give Ireland Back to the Irish) and a kids’ song (Mary Had a Little Lamb). He chose to record the band’s third album in Lagos, provoking two members of the group to quit. But despite getting mugged and having master tapes from the session stolen, the album Wings recorded there became the group’s most acclaimed and successful: Band on the Run.Paul McCartney: where to start in his solo back catalogueRead moreBy the middle of the decade, Wingshadreached square one hundred. In cultural memory, they are inevitably overshadowed by the Beatles, obscuring just how popular they were. Wings had more US No 1s than anyone except the Bee Gees. The Wings Over the World stadium tour of 1975-76 was huge, making the band one of the top-grossing live acts of the 70s. We can now appreciate how many of their songs are, to use the technical term, bangers: Band on the Run, Jet, Let ’Em In, Live and Let Die, to name a few.Wings Over the World was the zenith. After that things slowly subsided, commercially and musically, and the whole enterprise was more or less killed off in 1980 by McCartney’s attempt to take a large bag of cannabis into Japan, which landed him in prison and forced the cancellation of a tour. That was messy, but Wings was never neat. It had three different lead guitarists and four different drummers, and remained unbalanced by its lead singer’s outsize fame and talent. Under McCartney’s contrarian, impulsive, endlessly generative leadership, it blended imperial rock grandeur with a homemade ethos and a certain stoned nonchalance. Wings was always bound to be a spin-off from the Beatles universe – but what a spin-off it was.Ian Leslie is the author ofJohn & Paul: A Love Story in Songs(Faber).

You can understand why – unlike lust, anger or even sloth, it’s not something to admit to. In his Allegory with Venus and Cupid, Bronzino depicted envy as an ugly green hag, clutching her head and howling impotently; now Instagram has allowed anyone online to gain access to images of the lifestyles of those richer, prettier and luckier than ourselves.Ruth, the narrator of Harriet Lane’s third novel, Other People’s Fun, is corroded by it. Alone, her marriage over, her daughter grown and her freelance work as dull as it is low paid, she is that most dangerous of characters: an overlooked middle-aged woman with nothing to lose. When she bumps into beautiful, stupid and entitled Sookie at a school reunion, she reconnects with her teenage self “and all her violent desires”. Having flown under the radar as a pupil, noticed by Sookie only because she lent her her essays, she has perfect recall of her own petty humiliations, now amplified by the fact that she can stalk her contemporaries’ “best lives” on social media, while almost none of them remember her.“Are they spilling over with guile, or entirely lacking it? I am never sure. There they are, ceaselessly insisting on the fact of their existence, imagining someone might give a fuck about their dog, their children’s exam results, the Spanish Steps, a colander of blackberries on a wooden kitchen table … I lurk. I am the audience, transfixed, eyes shining in the darkness. After all, if someone wants to be seen, someone else must watch,” Ruth tells us.Lane’s two previous novels,Alys, AlwaysandHer, were elegant psychological thrillers revolving around toxic fascination between two women, one wealthier and seemingly more sophisticated than her intelligent but downtrodden foil. It’s the kind of fiction that Patricia Highsmith excelled at, or Zoë Heller in Notes on a Scandal, and a subgenre to which Lane has added layers of rage at being poor, powerless and almost invisible to the more fortunate.The fascination of Other People’s Fun is less its plot than its queasy portrait of stalking and manipulationIn Other People’s Fun, the prevailing mood is one of black comedy rather than menace. Ruth and Sookie are former contemporaries at a minor public school whose liberal ethos and complacent narcissism are reminiscent of Bedales (where Lane was a pupil). Decades later, the pretty people who once had eating disorders and kleptomania now own business empires which encompass “mindfulness festivals, forest bathing, organic skincare and a wellbeing podcast”. The only luxuries Ruth has are those that she shoplifts or steals from Sookie. Desperate to be seen, she’s like an Anita Brookner heroine on steroids. The clash between her resentful, sardonic intelligence and Sookie’s online self-satisfaction is deliciously uncomfortable, especially once Ruth realises that what her “friend” really wants is support to have an affair with their charismatic former teacher, Waxham, whom they both had a crush on as teenagers.Of course, Ruth offers Sookie her modest home in an unfashionable part of north London as a trysting place, and of course it will all go very wrong. The fascination of Other People’s Fun is less its plot than its queasy portrait of stalking and manipulation. Samuel Taylor Coleridge claimed that Iago in Othello had “motiveless malignancy” in his desire to destroy the noble Moor; Ruth’s envious hatred is, as she says, “all I’ve got in the tank right now”. Not that there is anything morally superior about her target. The contrast between the luxuries that Sookie takes for granted and our narrator’s struggle to survive as a low-paid translator of German marketing copy goes all the way back to boarding school, where “we were endlessly tumbled together like stones at the bottom of the sea. It knocked the corners off some of us, but some of us developed flint-sharp edges.”The best comedy is sharpened by pain, and what Lane has pinpointed in her flint-sharp novel is something that has a highly modern resonance as the world of the haves and have-nots becomes increasingly polarised and toxic. When Ruth gets her revenge, it is as nasty as it is total. You will, I fear, howl with satisfaction.Amanda Craig’s ninth novel, High & Low, is published next May by Abacus.

Over the past five years, developer Epic Games maintained the relevance and awareness of its ageing online shooter by churning out pop culture collaborations, from Marvel to John Wick to Sabrina Carpenter. For limited periods, players get to take part in the game as their favourite movie characters and music artists, an arrangement that provides refreshed audience numbers for the game – and a tidy revenue stream for the brands.Now it’s the turn ofThe Simpsons. This month, the Fortnite island has become a miniature Springfield, complete with popular characters and well-known locations. If you want to play as Homer and shoot up Moe’s Tavern, you can. If you want to take Bart to Kwik-E-Mart for a squishee, go ahead. Everywhere you look there’s a fun little Simpsons Easter egg, from the fact that the Battlebus (which delivers players on to the island) is now driven by Otis to the presence of Duffman, Seymour Skinner’s steamed hams and drooling aliens.But the Fortnite tie-in is only the latest example of a longstanding and symbiotic relationship between The Simpsons and video games. In 1991, less than two years after the show’s debut, Acclaim released Bart vs The Space Mutants, a side-scrolling platformer in which Bart must defeat an extraterrestrial invasion by doing frustrating pixel-perfect jumps and fighting bosses including Nelson and Sideshow Bob, while “enjoying” a scratchy sound sample of “eat my shorts” over and over again.Despite mediocre reviews, the game sold 1m copies, and inspired a rash of Bart-focused games such as Bart vs The World and Bart’s House of Weirdness. This interplay made perfect sense; Bart is, of course, a huge video game fan, and in the early days of the show, when he was the focal point of the writing, he represented the target demographic of the contemporary games industry: a mischievous 10-year-old boy with an interest in comical violence.The relationship would come to the fore in the classic 1995 Christmas episode Marge Be Not Proud in which Bart watches a TV ad for a hyper-violent hack-’em-up named Bonestorm.(The commercialhas a muscular Santa bursting into a family living room holding a rocket launcher and yelling: “Tell your folks, buy me Bonestorm or go to hell!”) It’s a clear parody of the frenzied, super-targeted marketing behind 1992’s Mortal Kombat, a game Bart would have relished thanks to its array of decapitations and eviscerations. At the end of the episode, Bart gets a video game for Christmas, but it’s the joyously sedate Lee Carvallo’s Putting Challenge. It’s funny, but it is also symbolic of the console war at the time: the rebellious Sega Mega Drive v the family-friendly Nintendo Entertainment System.View image in fullscreenEat my shorts … The Simpsons Bart vs The World for the NES.Photograph: Arcade Images/AlamyThe best early Simpsons game would arrive a few months after Bart vs Space Mutants. Konami’s 1992 arcade hit, The Simpsons, is an excellent four-player brawler in which the family is pitted against Mr Burns – who has, in a daft plot that is just an excuse to visit a lot of Springfield locations and attack enemies with skateboards and vacuum cleaners – kidnapped Maggie. My favourite example from the 1990s, though, was the 1996 PC release The Simpsons Cartoon Studio, which gave players a range of locations, characters and soundbites from the show in order to create their own mini Simpsons cartoons – a little foretaste of the TikTok memes Fortnite Simpsons fans are bound to make and share.Meanwhile, the show itself has kept finding new ways to gently satirise video games. Springfield’s regularly featured arcade Noiseland is crammed with amusing coin-operated games from Jane Fonda’s Legwarmers of Death to the wonderful My Dinner With André from season five’s Boy-Scoutz ’n the Hood (press up on the joystick to offer “Trenchant Insight”). But games are also used as a useful pop cultural tool for poking fun at the characters themselves. The favourite game of the godly Flanders kids is Billy Graham’s Bible Blaster, an evangelical preach-’em-up that has Rod Flanders shouting, “Keep firing; convert the heathens!”View image in fullscreenHey, hey kids … The Simpsons: Hit and Run.Photograph: Arcade Images/AlamyHowever, the Simpsons video game that probably best foreshadows the Fortnite tie-in is 2003’s much-loved Simpsons Hit & Run, a glorious Homer-fronted pastiche of Grand Theft Auto. Here you can drive around town visiting Android’s Dungeon, Krusty Burger and the Legitimate Businessman’s Social Club, while carrying out missions to prevent another alien plot. This was, to be honest, the last great Simpsons title, and it’s interesting how a lot ofthe games press coverageof the Fortnite tie-in is essentially: “I’d rather have Hit & Run 2, but I guess this will do.”What the collaboration really shows is how The Simpsons has continued to survive as a cultural icon, despite its decline as a must-watch TV phenomenon. The heady combination of slapstick, parody and social commentary aligns with the scrambled self-aware narratives of video games, where crazed violence often intercuts with gooey sentimentality and knockabout laughs. Both The Simpsons and video games came of age in the early 1990s, a hyperactive postmodern theme park of an era, and they have both continued to explore and exploit the worst excesses of our consumer society. Fortnite might not be the place we wanted to find a proper modern Simpsons game, but it makes sense for it to be here – a palace of memes, soundbites and cartoonish antics that will no doubt continue to generate fun and money for many years to come.What to playView image in fullscreenA work of great evil … Ball x Pit.Photograph: Kenny Sun/Devolver DigitalDespite how much I am enjoying it, I believe thatBall x Pitmay be a work of great evil. A concerningly potent combination of Space Invaders, Vampire Survivors and old ball-bouncing action games such as Breakout, it is a dungeon-delving arcade game in which you fire balls at lines of descending skeleton hordes as you descend down a bottomless pit. The balls bounce off enemies, or burn them, poison them, pass through them; every wave of defeated creatures unlocks a new suite of perks and bonuses and upgrades for you to combine. Above ground, you build a base for your characters and ping them about to harvest wood and stone to build yet more. The screen is always visually cacophonous, crowded with mesmerising waves of creatures and spells and bouncing balls. Most of the time I feel as if it’s playing itself. But still: it’s just so absorbing.Keza MacDonaldAvailable on:Nintendo Switch, PS5, Xbox, PC, MacEstimated playtime:Possibly forever, in 15-20 minute burstsWhat to readView image in fullscreen‘Blatant’ … Grand Theft Auto VI by Rockstar, which has been accused of union-busting.Photograph: Rockstar gamesThe Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, which represents a huge variety of gig economy workers including those on contracts at video game studios,has accusedGrand Theft Auto VI producerRockstar Gamesof “the most blatant and ruthless act of union-busting in the history of the games industry”.

Is it, perhaps, that coming up with interesting games that don’t involve fighting is too difficult?Not all games are violent, but all the big-budget games seem to be.”This is a much-discussed question among game designers and thinkers. Since Space Invaders, video games have presented players with an enemy to defeat: without competition and combat and adrenaline, how do you make it fun? Some see conflict as a driving force behind most stories, an almost inevitable part of game design. Others view video game violence as a failure of imagination.OnGamesindustry.bizin 2017, the game designer Brie Code posited that most games were geared towards inducing a fight-or-flight stress response in the player, and wrote about how games might move towards a different modality: tend-and-befriend. “What is game design missing? I ask this question in terms of game mechanics and game systems. I ask in terms of adrenaline, dopamine, oxytocin, opioids, and other reward systems. I ask in terms of gameplay, that helps a wider range of people understand themselves and their responses to stress and to the world.”I am also reminded of aGame Developer essayby Brian Fairbanks. “Life is complicated, messy, stressful and painful. Our problems take so many forms, and our chosen entertainment takes those problems, distills them into a single entity and puts a Foe badge on them,” he wrote. “The issue here is, in nonviolent games, we don’t have access to that power in the same way. Our games are structured so that the challenge and progression does not revolve around literally destroying your problems with weapons. We have to find other ways to get there.”By the way, there are a great many non-violent games around. Some of them, such as Animal Crossing, certainly count as blockbusters. There’s no comprehensive database off them, butThinkyGamesis the closest (you can filter out action, combat and timing), and there’s also an activenon-violent entertainmentcuration page onSteam. For family friendly, violence-free games,Common Sense Mediais a good resource.KMIf you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter –email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterFortniteThe SimpsonsAnimation on TVTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No, some will say. Probably people who have never played the original and don’t understand the appeal, but like to tilt their head with a mixture of bemusement and condescension and say: “So what do youdoin the game? Just wash things?”(It feels unfair that other pastimes don’t have to justify themselves like this. No one ever says, “Wait, you just run around the park in a circle for five kilometres?” Or, “So you just kick the ball with your foot?”)Yes, is the short answer. You point your hose at whatever mucky thing is in front of you – a bungalow, a monster truck, Lara Croft’s mansion – and blast all that filth into oblivion. Each time you finish a section, a pleasing ”ding” rings out, triggering your brain to release a little bit more dopamine. This is the only sound in the game, save for the rush of water and the occasional clang of a metal ladder. The whole experience is intensely soothing, deeply satisfying, and mesmerising. I love it.I love it so much that in 2023 I played PowerWash Simulator for 24 hours, 6 minutes and 33 seconds, live on streaming service Twitch –setting the Guinness World Recordfor the longest time spent playing the game.View image in fullscreenWash this … PowerWash Simulator 2.Photograph: FuturLabI would not recommend it. As enjoyable as the game is, the shine does start to wear off after about… 20 hours. I remember things started to get weird around 4am. The bright primary colours of the children’s playground I was cleaning began swirling together in a psychedelic frenzy. My vision was blurring, my fingers were aching, and I was overcome by a burning rage at the local council for allowing the climbing frame to get into this state.I pushed through with the support of myTwitchcommunity, who encouraged me to keep going and reminded me that a reality outside the game did exist. But I had flashbacks for months afterwards. Sometimes, lying in bed at night, I was convinced I could still hear the endless hiss of the jet spray, and would worry I’d given myself tinnitus. To this day I find it difficult to walk past a slide without checking the underside for mildew.Funnily enough, I didn’t feel like playing PowerWash Simulator for a while after the record-setting session. But it has been a joy to pick up the sequel and rediscover the sense of achievement that only comes from obliterating the final speck of encrusted faecal matter from a chrome toilet bowl. Bliss.It helps that this instalment feels a touch more forgiving when it comes to cleaning every last atom of dirt. There is also a new target icon directing you to bits you’ve missed, which makes finishing missions less frustrating.And of course there are new things to wash. PowerWash Simulator 2 features 38 missions in total, including an airship, a mobility scooter and a shopping mall. New gadgets include a surface cleaner for more efficient floor polishing, and a harness system so you can abseil down buildings. There’s a wider selection of soaps and nozzles, plus a new home base where you can display evidence of your achievements. This is particularly appealing if you’re the kind of person who has hung their (three) Guinness World Record certificates in the hallway so they’re the first thing the DPD driver sees when you open your front door.None of this adds up to a radical departure from the original game. Nor is the sequel likely to win over people who couldn’t see the point the first time around. But PowerWash Simulator 2gives the fans what they want: new things to wash, extra toys to play with, further unchallenging yet satisfying gameplay. Plus the option to occasionally draw a crude representation of male genitalia in the dirt for lols. With all the madness going on out there, this is exactly the game the world needs right now.PowerWash Simulator 2 is available now; £19.99/$24.99Explore more on these topicsGamesPCNintendo Switch 2TwitchSimulation gamescommentShareReuse this content"

Jakub Hrůša’s conducting draws out the music’s colours and the cast are uniformly strongErica JealWed 5 Nov 2025 10.40 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 10.42 ESTShareThe director Katie Mitchell recently announced that after nearly 30 years she was stepping back from opera. With this staging of Leoš Janáček’s The Makropulos Case – remarkably, a first for the Royal Opera – she’s going out with a bang.A reason Mitchell gave for her decision was misogyny, in both the business of opera and its material. She has addressed the second before here in Covent Garden productions, tweaking the stories of Donizetti’s Lucia di Lammermoor and Handel’s Theodora to give their heroines agency. You might think that’s not something that Elina Makropulos needs: after all, Janáček’s heroine has been alive since 1585, reinventing herself in every generation – always as an opera star, always with the initials EM – so she’s seen everything, and isn’t afraid of anyone. Yet Mitchell is still able to reinvigorate her story – this time with both her expected merciless exposure of male bad behaviour and unexpected humour. It feels as if she is sticking up a middle finger at her naysayers and her reputation for onstage gloom. Who knew a Katie Mitchell production could be this funny?View image in fullscreenImperious yet not invulnerable …  Ausrine Stundyte as Emilia Marty with Sean Panikkar as Albert Gregor, in The Makropulos Case, Royal Opera House, 2025Photograph: Camilla GreenwellAs the orchestra tears into the overture, a huge smartphone screen appears above the set: here is Emilia Marty, her current pseudonym, in her hotel room on a dating app. She swipes right on Krista, who is “looking for something casual”, but who will a few hours later have committed murder and acquired a formula for the elixir of life. It’s Krista who is the fulcrum of Mitchell’s reinterpretation: she and her boyfriend Janek have turned thieves and Marty is the mark. Vicki Mortimer’s set creates first a chic present-day hotel, then a utilitarian backstage area, both with mirror frames through which we see the characters in moments of, literally, self-reflection.As so often in Mitchell’s productions, there are at least two scenes happening at once in neighbouring rooms – three if you count the phone screen – and it’s perhaps too easy to lose track of crucial details when there’s so much of interest going on. Sometimes, one feels the lack of stillness – and Marty’s final monologue happens in a section of the stage surely barely visible to a chunk of the audience – but the drama is convincingly acted and very well sung by a strong cast, including Heather Engebretson as Krista, Johan Reuter as overbearing Jaroslav Prus, Sean Panikkar as Gregor and Alan Oke as Hauk-Šendorf, whose reunion with his long-lost love is genuinely touching.At the centre of it all is a magnificent, magnetic performance fromAusrine Stundyteas Emilia Marty, imperious yet not invulnerable. Her voice soars above the orchestra even as Jakub Hrůša’s conducting draws out the deep contrasts and bright colours of Janáček’s score, given in an unbroken, 90-minute stretch. It’s an exhilarating evening; the opera world is going to miss Mitchell perhaps more than it realises.At theRoyal Opera House, London, until 21 November.Explore more on these topicsOperaRoyal Opera HouseClassical musicLeoš JanáčekreviewsShareReuse this content"

As he unveils the building and its ‘unapologetically diverse’ contents, can he pull it off?Jason OkundayeTue 4 Nov 2025 19.01 ESTShareWhen Gus Casely-Hayford was a child, his sister Margaret took him to the British Museum. He hadn’t always enjoyed museums: “As much as I was attracted to them, they weren’t places I felt wholly welcome in,” he says – especially since they rarely told the stories of Black British people like him. But Margaret was determined. “She told me that these spaces belong to all of us. They may not tell our stories, but she would say to me ‘That’s something that you can change.’”Now, as the director of V&A East, he’s building a space in which “young people can come in and have those transformative moments that change the trajectory of their lives”. These are grand ambitions for the project which lives on two sites in London’s Olympic Park:V&A Storehouse, which opened in May this year and has already exceeded its visitor target in a third of the projected time, and V&A East Museum, an exhibition and gallery space housed within a five-storey building designed by Irish architects O’Donnell & Tuomey on Stratford Waterfront. The aim, says V&A director Tristram Hunt, is “to open the V&A’s collection up in new ways to audiences which have historically been underserved by major cultural institutions”.After years of delay, which Casely-Hayford attributes to “the pandemic … issues with labour supply” and the enormous challenge of launching “two buildings of this level of complexity”, the museum site will finally open its doors to the public on18 April next year. It’s a key part ofEast Bank, the mayor of London’s £1.1bn cultural and education quarter designed to transform the former Olympic boroughs, what Hunt calls “a crucial component of the London 2012 legacy”. V&A East sits alongside Sadler’s Wells East, London College of Fashion, UCL East and BBC Music Studios. What slice of the pie did the V&A get from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport? A “very generous” one, Casely-Hayford replies.View image in fullscreen‘Objects that tell the story of human creativity’ … a rendering of the V&A East Museum’s Why We Make galleries.Photograph: JA_Projects for the Victoria and Albert Museum, LondonThe director is charming and cheerful, but it’s his passion for the arts which leaves the greatest impression when I meet him at the V&A Storehouse, surrounded by a collage of references from football shirts to bikes and vases left by local school students. His mission for V&A East was to make it a welcoming and inspiring place for any young, creatively minded person who might not yet be ready to absorb the South Kensington V&A, the institution’s mothership, but who has grown out of Young V&A, aimed at children under 14. Casely-Hayford says that east London was the perfect home: as well as the capital’s traditional manufacturing and designing base, “it has given us some of the truly great creative figures – Alexander McQueen, David Bailey”. Casely-Hayford says that he is determined to find “equivalent figures” within younger generations and have V&A East as their point of access to the arts. “You see lots of young people who are full of that creative passion, but they don’t necessarily feel at home in museums.”To address this, over the course of the past five years, he has personally visited every single secondary school in the four boroughs surrounding the site, while the broader project has consulted about 30,000 young people, influencing every aspect of the institution, from the permanent collection to the staff uniform (a burgundy waistcoat with a cinched back that can be customised to allow for self-expression). The staffing of the project also reflects the demographic complexity of the area. “We’ve worked really hard to embed V&A East in local communities,” Casely-Hayford says. “This is a space that belongs to them. These are collections which belong to all of us. Hearing them reflect back the passion, the aspirations, the objectives, in terms that are theirs is deeply heartening.”So what will be on show? Hunt says that “we have radically reinterpreted the V&A’s world-class collections through a contemporary lens, allowing us to explore topics that matter to our audiences, such as representation, identity, wellbeing, craft practice and social justice.” V&A East Museum’s permanent collection is called Why We Make. “Before we walk or talk,” Casely-Hayford says, “we make. It’s an impulse that is shared by every culture and across the span of human history.”The idea that we shouldn’t be trying to make our audience broad and diverse is absurdThe collection is composed of about 500 objects from more than 200 practitioners across more than 60 nations. One is a piece by Bisila Noah, an Ecuadorian Guinea Spanish ceramicist, which Casely-Hayford describes as “absolutely exquisite”. There will also be a pink dress by local designerMolly Goddard, and textiles from the postwar Trinidadian designerAlthea McNish, “objects that tell the story of human creativity through all the different mediums that the V&A is known for.” V&A East will, Casely-Hayford says, be unapologetically diverse. “Those different components of intellectual DNA inform all national museums. The idea that we shouldn’t be engaging in trying to make our audiences as broad, as diverse, as universal as possible, seems to be counter to that.”There will also be temporary exhibitions, the first calledThe Music Is Black, an odyssey through 125 years of Black British music history, exploring genres from calypso and hip-hop to reggae and drill. Casely-Hayford won’t go into details about what the exhibition contains, but Seal, Shirley Bassey, Stormzy and Little Simz will all feature in some way, along with the first guitar owned by Joan Armatrading, a “personal hero” of the director.As optimistic as this all sounds, how will Casely-Hayford handle the bigger issues facing museums? He has been a leading voice in the return of looted artefacts, an issue the V&A isconfronting. “I’m very proud that the V&A is among a number of museums who have returned objects, particularly the programme we’ve been involved in withGhana,” he says. “We’re limited by statute in the ways we can engage with these collections, so they are returned on loan, and are on display in the Manhyia Palace Museum at this very moment.”View image in fullscreenPioneer … Shirley Bassey in the first temporary exhibition The Music Is Black.Photograph: © Harry Hammond, Courtesy of Victoria and Albert Museum, LondonOn the issue of ethical funding (since, like many museums, V&A East will use corporate sponsorship to help pay for some temporary exhibitions) he’s less specific. Some museum representatives have dismissed objections to museums taking money from companies which pollute the environment or worse as“relentless negativity”. “Ethical funding is something that concerns everyone who works in museums,” Casely-Hayford says. “And of course, we would want to be deeply scrupulous about any institution, company or partner that we engage with.”He’s a scion of the Casely-Hayford dynasty, a prominent Ghanaian-British family descended from JE Casely-Hayford, a 19th-century politician and writer who was an advocate of pan-African nationalism. His Ghanaian father, Victor, was a trained lawyer who worked as an accountant, and his Sierra Leonean mother, Ransolina, worked for the British Council. Both were immigrants to Britain.His elder siblings were all high achievers – his sister Margaret was chancellor of Coventry University, and brother Peter an executive producer of BBC’s Panorama. Another brother Joe, who died of cancer in 2019 aged 62, was a pioneering fashion designer, and the focal point of Somerset House’s 2023 exhibition on Black fashion,The Missing Thread. Casely-Hayford becomes emotional when talking about him. “I absolutely adored him, he was my inspiration,” he says. “The other day I was looking at my bookshelves. I have a range of very old art books and when I opened them up, every single one was a present from him.”View image in fullscreenLocal talent … work by designer Molly Goddard, will feature.Photograph: Ben Broomfield/Image courtesy of Molly GoddardCasely-Hayford has had a long and varied career, presenting the BBC seriesLost Kingdoms of Africa, authoring books on West African art and, before joining V&A East, working as director of theSmithsonian’s National Museum of African Artin Washington DC (he says that it “breaks my heart” to see the Trumpian persecution of his former colleagues’ work). His first start in the museum sector came after he completed his PhD in African history from SOAS University of London and joined the learning department of the British Museum, the same space in which Margaret told him of the possibility of change.While there he stagedAfrica 05, the largest African arts season ever hosted in Britain, which engaged 150 cultural institutions to “contribute towards a particular moment in 2005 when we celebrated Africa and its history”. This extravaganza also served as a disruption to the sector. “Museums, by their very nature, are conservative,” Casely-Hayford says. “They don’t just hold the past. But many people within museums reify aspects of it.” What did he learn from pulling off this feat? “That you can make the changes that seem to be impossible.”He describes V&A East as the greatest project of his career, in fulfilling his aim to make these institutions which were founded “for all of us” universally accessible. “These are spaces that tell our stories through the best things that humanity has ever created,” he says. “The arts are about us making a mark that we hope will outlast us. And one of the few ways in which we can really know what other people are feeling, rather than thinking alone, is through creativity.Museumsare repositories of the finest of those impulses.”V&A East Museum opens on 18 April 2026Explore more on these topicsArt and designV&AMuseumsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Slough-based dancer and choreographer has made pieces about domestic violence (Bird), sexuality (You&Me) and nonconformist women (Slut). She often works in consultation with community groups, drawing on the lives of marginalised and underrepresented women. Rooted in north Indian kathak dance, she has an unforced authority over her movement, a softness and certainty, that draws your focus towards her.But Khayyam’s latest piece, Bibi Rukiya’s Reckless Daughter, doesn’t quite hit home. It is in part inspired by Federico García Lorca’s The House of Bernarda Alba, the story of a grieving, domineering mother who isolates her five daughters in an oppressive household. Khayyam’s take is a story of how families, and mothers, perpetuate patriarchal systems by repeating the repressions they themselves experienced.The matriarch of the tale is potentially a fascinating character for Khayyam to explore – the tensions between tradition, honour, respect and freedom, the fear and love you have for your children. In this version, Bibi Rukiya has three daughters, one mostly falling in line – mother and daughter dance together, at a distance but in sync. The other two are more tearaway, wanting to dress up in high heels and dance a Bollywood-pop mashup to Beyoncé – at least until the spectre of their mother puts a lid on their fun.View image in fullscreenMuted in disapproval … Amina Khayyam as the mother in Bibi Rukiya’s Reckless Daughter.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianRather than domineering, Khayyam is a sometimes distant figure, muted in disapproval. The whole show is somewhat muted, in fact. There is a low-level tension, brooding like the anxious shimmer of bells on dancer Abirami Eswar’s ankles. But the real grit and detail of the subject – the question of what these women desire and in what way they are being thwarted, the texture of their emotions, the complexity of the characters and their family dynamic – is absent. It all ends in tragedy but tinged with confusion.As well as Lorca, the story is based on the experience of one of the women who took part in Khayyam’s community groups. There is powerful real-life testimony at the heart of this work, but too much goes unsaid.Atthe Place, London, until 5 NovemberExplore more on these topicsStageDanceFederico García LorcaTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Hereprises the rolefor the West End now and, after a glossy career mostly on screen in the interim, is one of the most arresting stage actors around. Harewood’s Othello holds your attention with his physical presence and imperial quality, the sniffs, smirks and tics in the lead up to his murderously wounded rage. He is so captivating to the other characters that they are frozen as he tells of meeting Desdemona at the start. He woos them, and us.Harewood is not the only Black actor on stage, which reflects Venice’s historical cultural mix, and there is not the sense of racial isolation. However, the racist language is still jarring, all the more so perhaps because Tom Morris’s production is modern-dress.View image in fullscreenShining relish … Toby Jones.Photograph: Brinkhoff-MoegenburgThe starry casting is judicious.Toby Jones, never out of fatigues as not-so-honest Iago, fights his battle for domination with a shining relish that borders on the comically conniving. He is best in company, a seemingly unassuming foot-soldier who stands in stark contrast to the man who fulminates and plots in soliloquies downstage, which seem like secrets shared with the audience.Caitlin FitzGerald, as Desdemona, is a smooth blend of strength and fearfulness, her American accent gargled with Irish, it seems. A surprising slap from her husband is one of the biggest shocks of the play, an awful turning point. Luke Treadaway (who worked with Morris on War Horse) is a paragon of goodness as Cassio, with a blond-haired air of the angelic. Vinette Robinson is marvellous as Desdemona’s maid, Emilia, and the two women’s reflections on the misogyny in their worlds reminds us of Shakespeare’s progressiveness: this is a play about gender as well as race, the wrongs wreaked on women, not only onOthello.But these are points that are mentioned, rather than built upon. This is every bit a “West End Othello” that is ravishing to look at, immaculately choreographed and darkly humorous. It is pacy and does not probe deeply or seek to connect the play’s manipulations with our era of Trumpian truths and lies (and our own trusting of the wrong people?). There is an impressive clarity of language and events as we hear how doubt against Desdemona’s virtue is first cast by her own father, Brabantio (Peter Guinness), who says “she deceived her father and may thee”, before Iago capitalises on it.Ti Green’s set laps with beauty, romantic or baleful with every switch of light and sound. PJ Harvey’s music – doomy notes and delicate tingles – adds to it. The opening scene comes with a series of grand gold frames, set against blackness all around so that it looks like characters are errant historical figures that have jumped out of their gilt-edged oil paintings, into the now. It turns modern, with diaphanous screens that gesture at doorways and corners, for whispering, spying and eavesdropping. The papal red of the senators’ gowns prefigures the blood-letting. An iridescent sky streaks across the back, turning red when Othello’s murderous jealousy is unleashed. The colours are bold, silken, glittering.It’s impressive but you are not always swept in. This is an unanchored Othello, afloat against its shifting shades of sky. That is both its weakness and strength.AtTheatre Royal Haymarket, London, until 17 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreOthelloWest EndDavid HarewoodToby JonesTom MorrisPJ HarveyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Ina zero-star review, the Guardian’s Lucy Mangan said it was “fascinatingly, incomprehensibly, existentially terrible”, while writing for the Times, Ben Dowellcalledit “tacky and revolting”.All’s Fair review – Kim Kardashian’s divorce drama is fascinatingly, existentially terribleRead moreThe series, about a female-led law firm specialising in divorce, now hasa 6% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with just one positive review.“You’re not going to please everybody,” Hemingway said. “You may have certain criticisms, while there are a million others who love it … It may not be for you, and that’s okay, but I personally enjoy the show. I had a lot of fun relating to it in my own way. Not everything is for everybody, and you can’t also expect one person to define something and for that be the totality of what it is – I don’t agree with that.”Hemingway’s previous credits include acclaimed hits such as True Blood, Shameless, ER and The Wire, a show he brought up as an example in the interview.“I also think sometimes things may take time,” he said. “I did The Wire. No one liked the show when it was out. They hated it. They didn’t watch it. Two people watched it every week. But it got to a point where it found a moment. I’m not comparing the show to The Wire – let’s get that straight – but it’s an example of how people can react to something in one moment and it becomes something totally different in another time. The show takes a minute to get into gear, but I do feel like it is absolutely striking something that is refreshing and creatively fulfilling.”He also defended the show as “wish fulfillment” that shouldn’t be taken as seriously as other legal dramas. Hemingway believes that in a world that is “dark and heavy and decisive”, the show is “a way to connect to the human condition and certain aspects of humanity”.He added: “Hopefully opinions will change. But if they don’t, then they don’t. What we are all doing excites us, and we stand by it … Don’t come at it with such a critical or literal frame of mind. It strikes a different tone, and it will evolve over time; it will get more human.”Kardashian, who has previously acted in a series of American Horror Story, has been heavily criticised in the show with the Hollywood Reporter’s Angie Handescribingher performance as “stiff and affectless without a single authentic note”.Hemingway also defended her saying she was “very open, willing, ready and capable to deliver what was asked of her”.Explore more on these topicsUS televisionKim KardashianTelevisionNaomi WattsGlenn CloseRyan MurphynewsShareReuse this content"

The winner was announced at a ceremony in central London on Wednesday evening.Born in Manchester and now based in Hebden Bridge, Rose is the author of four previous books. We Live Here Now is his first to be shortlisted for theGoldsmiths prize. Through a series of short stories, the novel looks at the after-effects of the disappearances of visitors to an art installation.Amy Sackville, judging chair and senior lecturer in creative writing at Goldsmiths, University of London, described the winning title as “a book about what art is and what it does (or doesn’t do)”.Author and fellow judge Simon Okotie called We Live Here Now “a dizzying, encyclopaedic series of stories linked by texture, resonance and suggestion”. He said the book traces “the invisible circuits and networks – of love, capital and war – that shape our contemporary lived experience”.Tanjil Rashid, culture editor at the New Statesman, which co-runs the prize, said Rose’s “dazzling and strange fictions reveal his incredible gift for writing”, adding: “I’m so glad he is receiving the recognition and readership he deserves so early in his career.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

When the excited cohosts asked whether Lawrence and Stone, longtime friends and two of the most successful film actors of their generation, would co-star in the project, Lawrence teased: “I think so. We have to … It’s fucked up [that we haven’t done a movie together].”Lawrence also revealed that she considered making her Broadway debut inOh, Mary!, Escola’s historical farce that has seen a range of actors from Jane Krakowski and Tituss Burgess fill the role of Mary Todd Lincoln. The intensely physical comedy, for which Escola won the Tony for best actor in a play, reimagines the former first lady as a historically clueless, alcoholic, aspiring cabaret singer who benefits greatly from her husband’s assassination.“The whole thing is a joke she’s in on,” Lawrence told the podcast. “I felt like I could be big and in on the joke.” She decided not to pursue the role, she said, after considering the physical rigor of Broadway’s punishing eight-shows-a-week schedule.“I don’t think I would be good at [theater] … It’s all your body and voice,” she said. “The only time I wanted to do theater was I wanted to do Oh, Mary! They were like, ‘It’s eight shows a week and six weeks of rehearsal.’ I was like, ‘Do you have daycare there?’ It just wouldn’t have worked.”Lawrence is currently promotingDie, My Love, a psychological thriller of a crumbling marriage in which she stars opposite Robert Pattinson.

That changes with the MoMA’s blockbuster show Wifredo Lam: When I Don’t Sleep, I Dream.‘A world detached from struggles of urban life’: a rare exhibition of Renoir drawingsRead moreThe product of years of work and dozens of collaborations with institutions and collectors around the world, When I Don’t Sleep, I Dream shows the entire sweep of a career that straddled eras. Lam is best-known for agglomerations of elongated and mysterious figures that borrow from cubism and surrealism, although the exhibition also shows different sides of this artist: lushly colored and textured pieces that verge on abstraction, sculptural heads that point toward the artist’s African roots, early figurative works, and the weird cacophonies of forms that the artist made through the 1960s and 70s.“He knew that what he was doing may not have been understandable to the people of the street of even his peers, but that a true picture has the power of the imagination to work, and it just might take a little time,” said Beverly Adams, a curator with the MoMA who organized When I Don’t Sleep, I Dream alongside MoMA’s director, Christophe Cherix. “He knew what he was going was hard and important and would have relevance long beyond his time.”View image in fullscreenWifredo Lam – La jungla (The Jungle), 1942-43.Photograph: Emile Askey/The Museum of Modern Art, New York. Photo by Emile Askey.Following a major European 2015 retrospective that touched down at the Pompidou, the Tate and the Reina Sofía, New York’s MoMA was determined to offer a suitably large retrospective of Lam in the United States. Cherix and Adams knew that this would be a massive undertaking, as well as one that would require a great deal of persistence and ingenuity.According to Adams, all of this hard work was in service of opening dialogues that could only come from bringing together so much of Lam’s creative output. “There have been smaller-scale shows, but never really any institution that’s taken on the complexity, logistically of a show this size,” she said. “We traveled all over to see as many things as we could, and we were able to get loans of things that we dreamed of but weren’t sure we could get, things that have been hidden in private collections for decades and decades and that needed to come back out into the public. It’s important to see these things alongside together. We wanted to have those dialogues between those works.”The MoMA has a long history with Lam, beginning with his Mother and Child in 1939, the first Lam work to be acquired by any institution in the world. “It’s a very simple, hieratic portrait of a woman holding a child,” said Cherix. “It feels like it’s both grief and tenderness at once. It relates to his personal story of losing a wife and child to tuberculosis in Spain in the early 1930s, but it also has this degree of tenderness that makes it feel like a universal portrait that could include anybody.”From there, the MoMA would go on to acquire Lam’s unquestioned masterpiece The Jungle in 1945. Measuring over 7ft on each side, the massive oil and charcoal work blends together pieces of human bodies, along with jungle trees, animals and other aspects of the landscape into a work that feels almost limitless in its complex web of interconnections. It has become known as a major example of the cross-fertilization between the major artistic currents of cubism and surrealism then dominating Europe with the colonial realities that African-Caribbean individuals such as Lam would have been forced to live under.View image in fullscreenWifredo Lam – Grande Composition (Large Composition), 1949.Photograph: Emile Askey/The Museum of Modern Art, New York“You can see the amazing thing he was doing in Marseille, with Breton and the other surrealists,” said Adams, “you can really see all these bits and pieces coming together. You can see Cuba in this neo-colonial state, a country run on sugar and tourism, where issues of race, inequality and the colonial legacy are still very visible. It gathers his time in Europe with his return to Cuba.”Another major and rarely seen piece included in this show is the aptly titled Grande Composition, Lam’s largest work, which had spent decades residing in a Paris apartment building of all places. The piece had long been in the holdings of a Belgian art collector before finding its way to Paris, which, due to its enormous 14ft-by-9ft size, seemed destined to be its final resting place.“It was high on our list,” said Cherix. “We were able after a few attempts to see the work, and we found it absolutely essential. That started a long conversation that took a couple of years, we had to convince a collector that we could ship it to NY safely. We knew that the MoMA would be one of the few places that could preserve it for future generations.”One of the major points of including Grande Composition, made in 1949, is to remind audiences that Lam had a flourishing career after the high water mark of Jungle. In fact, Lam would go on creating right up to his death in 1982, including a series of etchings and poems released in collaboration with Césaire.View image in fullscreenWifredo Lam. Untitled, 1958.Photograph: Wifredo Lam Estate“Grande Composition was so important to us to show that there was an after Jungle,” said Cherix. “Lam remained so critical in the decade that came afterwards.”Although the MoMA wasunable to secure any loans from the National Museum of Fine Arts in Havana, a major holder of about 200 works by Lam, there was much cross-fertilization between the institutions, including bringing Cuban scholars to New York to see The Jungle. “It was very moving seeing Cuban scholars who had studied Lam for virtually their whole lives, seeing The Jungle for the first time ever in person,” said Cherix.And to hear the way that Cherix and Adams talk about Lam, the MoMA sounds almost certain to do another show, possibly one that will eventually include works currently in Cuba. “An exhibition is always one step further, but there’s a lot to be done on Lam,” said Cherix. “There’s so much that remains to be done. We’re really looking forward to people finally having access to a large body of his work.”“He’s truly a model of the transnational artist,” added Adams. “Maybe we didn’t have the vocabulary to think about that before. He was shoehorned into categories that didn’t really fit, but we are trying to crack open the conversation wider.”Wifredo Lam: When I Don’t Sleep, I Dream is on display at theMuseum of Modern Artin New York from 10 November to 11 AprilExplore more on these topicsArtPaintingExhibitionsMuseum of Modern ArtCubafeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Ilove jumpers. Jumpers are my happy place. I know we are supposed to call them sweaters or knits because it sounds more posh, sorry,elevated, but my heart belongs to good old jumpers.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.So I am thrilled that the twinset is back, because the only thing better than wearing a jumper is wearing two. But, as you may have noticed from the photo, the twinset no longer looks quite how you remember it. Traditionally, a twinset is a crew-neck jumper, long or short sleeved, with a matching cardigan. It looks as though it probably smells of lavender sachets and as if its wearer might drop into a curtsey at any moment.But the twinset 2.0 is a loose, informal hook-up between two pieces of knitwear. It could be wearing one jumper, and tying a chunky cable-knit one in a similar shade around your shoulders, scarf-style. It could be layering a knitted waistcoat over a jumper in the same colour. It could be wearing a short-sleeved merino wool T-shirt, skater-style, with a long-sleeved, fine-gauge sweater beneath.In the layering months – which is half the year in the UK, after all – your fashion credentials shine more inhowyou wear clothes than through which pieces you wear. Just the right sliver of white T-shirt at the neck of a jumper makes all the difference. Cheerful stripy shirt cuffs exposed by the pushed up sleeves of your sober blazer. These details – not the clothes themselves, certainly not the label inside those clothes – make you look, well, a bitfashion.The new twinset is a way to experiment with texture, proportion and colourThe joy of a twinset is that the extra jumper adds practicality plus panache. There is a through line from the few-years-back vogue for shoulder-robing a jacket, making it look shruggy and cardigan-soft, through to the on-the-street trend for draping a jumper around your shoulders, not as clothing exactly, but as a sort of knitwear necklace or cosy ornamental shoulder pad. There is also, in the unbuttoned chill vibe, a note of gentle rebellion against the pared-back minimalism of recent years.Fashion has always loved layers. Think of the 1990s and early 2000s: camisoles over T-shirts, long sleeves peeking out from under short. This new twinset trend feels as if that adolescent experimentation and the grandmotherly tone of the matching cardigan and sweater set have met somewhere in the middle. It is a little bit preppy, another trend which works across the generations. But while the Ivy League students of the 1950s were all affluence and aftershave, and Ralph Lauren’s 1980s adverts resurrected the trope with sweaters marketed as lifestyle props, the attitude has changed. It’s not trying so hard. Sleeves are tied low, sometimes slung asymmetrically. Less boarding school prefect, more art school maverick.Jess Cartner-Morley on fashion: the number-one rule for coats this winter – make it longRead moreThe new twinset is a way to experiment with texture, proportion, and colour. A cable knit heaps texture across the shoulders of a fine cashmere crew neck. A bold striped sweater injects personality on to a monochrome base. A chunky fisherman knit adds architecture to a sleek merino turtleneck. Two sweaters at once is a tiny, wearable extravagance, a little wink at maximalism.If you are not a fan of the draped-over-the-shoulder look, sleeveless knits come into their own in the world of the new look twinset. Not having two sets of sleeves makes it much easier to get your coat on. And the newness of the sleeveless knit as a look adds jazziness to every outfit.Ultimately, the new twinset trend speaks to our collective craving for comfort that doesn’t abandon style. After a long spell of loungewear dominance, fashion lovers want to be cosy but polished. Visual intrigue, but tactile reassurance too. Fashion has taken something quaint, and made it cool again. You don’t need to buy anything new (just raid the knitwear pile), but the result feels fresh. One jumper is always a good idea. Two jumpers might be genius.Model: Kentha at Milk.

David Bowie made me realise the truthWhen I went to the Bowie exhibition at the V&A, I hoped that by losing myself in his gender experimentation I might, in turn, stumble across a clue to my own identity ...Oliver RadclyffeWed 5 Nov 2025 01.55 ESTShareIn 2011, a couple of years before theDavid Bowie Isexhibition opened at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, I came out as a lesbian. Up until that point I had been exclusively dating men, one of whom I married. Two years later, I was in my early 40s, a newly separated mother of four children, living in the US. I had started to question my gender identity, as well as my sexual orientation, and was looking for some answers.I was born in England in the early 1970s – before the advent of the internet. As a teenager, my friends and I didn’t have Reddit or YouTube to turn to when we had questions about sex; instead, we turned to pop stars, and in the 80s everyone was messing with gender. Annie Lennox wore boys’ clothes, Boy George wore girls’ clothes, and pop groups such as Erasure and Bronski Beat had members who were out and proud.View image in fullscreenRadclyffe visiting the David Bowie Is exhibition in New York, in 2018.Photograph: Courtesy of Oliver RadclyffeI spent the 90s riding a motorbike and dressing like a tomboy, but I reverted back to femininity when I opted to get married. My husband relocated us to the US in 2007, but when the marriage fell apart I felt an irresistible pull back towards the masculinity I’d given up. And since nobody played with gender quite likeDavid Bowie, I decided to spend a free afternoon on a summer trip back to the UK at the V&A, in the hope that maybe he could help me figure it out.I didn’t know exactly what I was looking for when I walked into the exhibition – perhaps I hoped that by losing myself in the opulence of Bowie’s gender experimentation I might, in turn, stumble across a clue to my own identity. I soon found myself standing in front of a small television screen on which thevideo for Boys Keep Swingingwas playing on repeat. Bowie was strutting his stuff in the foreground, looking sharp in a dark grey suit, while off to one side three backing singers dressed in drag crowded round a microphone. Unlike the drag queens I had encountered in real life, these ladies weren’t sashaying around the stage with the confidence of born divas; instead they looked bored and annoyed. Relegated to the background, they chewed gum and rolled their eyes at the tedium of it all.I wanted his narrow hips and sharp haircut, his angular jaw and flat chest. I wanted to embody the Berlin-era Bowie“Boys keep swinging, boys always work it out,” Bowie sang cheerfully, apparently oblivious to their lack of enthusiasm. I felt a momentary pang of empathy for the backing singers, with their heavy makeup, uncomfortable wigs and too-tight dresses. They appeared to feel as uncomfortable as I did in women’s clothes – irritated and impatient, as if they were longing for it all to be over. Just as I realised I was identifying with three men dressed in drag, one of them ripped off her wig, smeared the lipstick from her face, and revealed herself to be … Bowie! Shocker. (Of course, there were two other David Bowies as well.)At that moment, I knew for certain that I wanted to rip it all off and become Bowie too. I wanted his narrow hips and his sharp haircut, his angular jaw and his flat chest; I wanted to embody the slim-silhouetted, Berlin-era Bowie. And yet I couldn’t, because to truly become Bowie, first I would need to be a man. Coming out as gay was one thing, but transitioning was a much more frightening prospect.It took me several more years before I was ready. In the meantime, I did my best to become more masculine: I stopped wearing makeup and threw away all my skirts and dresses, cut off my hair and started wearing men’s clothes. I sat differently, walked differently, and changed my name and pronouns, but I stopped short of medical intervention – the possibility of rejection and regret had left me paralysed with fear.A moment that changed me: I told my dad I was queer – and he said he found it hard to love meRead moreWhen the David Bowie Is exhibition finished its world tour with a stint in Brooklyn, New York, five years later, I went back. I had reached a breaking point. I couldn’t go on pretending to be something I was not. Standing in front of the same video in 2018, I knew for certain that the problem wasn’t my clothes, it was my body. I wasn’t a masculine woman; I was a feminine man who’d been wearing drag all his life. I wanted to transform myself into the man in the sharp suit, dancing in the spotlight, and now I realised that I could.I booked myself in to see a doctor shortly afterwards. It took another few years before my transition was complete, but none of the things I feared came true. I still have many of my feminine mannerisms, so people often mistake me for a gay man, but I’m OK with that. I wanted the freedom to play with gender like Bowie did – and now that I’m comfortable in my body, I can.Frighten the Horses: A Memoir of Transition by Oliver Radclyffe is published by Grove Press (£16.99).

As the UK faces increasing disease related to poor diets as well as increasing food prices, and the campaigners argue that it is the correct time to launch a drive to “bang in some beans” to the nation’s meals.Oliver said: “It’s no secret that I love beans. Not only are they delicious and affordable, they’re plant-based powerhouses that are packed with fibre, are a brilliant source of protein and live happily in your store cupboard for ages. If there’s anything we should be eating more of, it’s beans.”Supermarkets supporting the Bang in Some Beans campaign include Lidl, which has pledged to increase volume sales for all bean products by 50% by 2028; Sainsbury’s, which is aiming to increase sales tonnage for beans and pulses by 2028; and M&S, who say they will increase volume sales for all ambient bean products by 15% by 2028. Waitrose and Ocado have also said they will advertise more legumes to customers.Growing many types of bean fixes nitrogen into the soil, improving its health, and they are a useful replacement or supplement for more carbon-intensive proteins, such as meat. They are also high in fibre (only 4% of Britons get their recommended daily amount), and 4.5 times cheaper than other plant-based meat alternatives. A new report by the Food Foundation, supporting the campaign, has found that to meet theEat-Lancet’s planetary health diet, UK bean consumption would need to increase sevenfold.Food production is a big cause of climate breakdown, amounting toabout a quarterof the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.Three-fifths of those emissions come from meat production, leading many to argue for a shift towards a plant-based diet. On average it takes15,400 litres of waterto make 1kg of beef, butabout 5,000litres for the same amount of beans.Fearnley-Whittingstall, another of the supporters of the campaign, said: “Beans are fantastic for your health and are packed full of fibre, protein and micro-nutrients. Put simply, we should all be eating more of them.“The Bang in Some Beans campaign is bringing together chefs, influencers and food businesses so we can all get excited about trying new beany recipes, whether that’s exploring exciting dishes from all over the world, or simply banging some beans into family favourites to give them a brilliant boost.”TheFoodFoundation has called for more chefs, retailers and restaurant chains to join the bean crusade to increase the marketing and selling of the legumes.Rebecca Tobi, the head of food business transformation at the Food Foundation, said: “Beans are a win-win-win for our health, the environment and our wallets at a time when food prices continue to rise.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Turn what might otherwise be wasted into this luxurious toffee sauce to savour on Bonfire Night, especially when drizzled generously over cinnamon baked apples with scoops of vanilla ice-cream.Toffee sauce with baked applesApples transform beautifully when baked, turning this hyper-seasonal fruit into a super-simple yet decadent dessert. I prefer cox or braeburn varieties (ie, something not too large), so you can serve one apple per person.Gordon Ramsay’s recipes are my go-to for traditional techniques that deliver reliable results. Here, I’ve adapted his recipe for caramel sauce to make use of every last drop from a golden syrup tin, reduced the amount of sugar, and added sea salt and optional vanilla to heighten the quintessential taste of British toffee. (The invert sugars in golden syrup are the secret to achieving a silky-smooth toffee sauce, because sugar alone can recrystallise, leaving it grainy.) If you don’t have golden syrup, glucose syrup or honey also work well.This versatile sauce works with all manner of desserts, from a classic banana split to these baked apples with ice-cream. The warm sauce melts seductively over the hot fruit, creating a wonderful juxtaposition of flavours, textures and temperatures. Keep any excess sauce in a sealed container in the fridge for up to two weeks, or for a few months in the freezer.Serves6-8For the toffee sauce2-3 tbspgolden syrup(I used the dregs of a tin), or glucose syrup or honey180g sugar(white or brown)½ tsp sea salt150ml double cream50g unsalted butter1 tsp vanilla extract(optional)For the apples6 medium dessert apples60g sultanas or raisins30g sugar30g butter½ tsp ground cinnamonCream or ice-cream, to serveTo get every last drop from a tin of golden syrup, pour in about 100ml boiling water and, holding the tin in a cloth to protect your hand, swirl it around and scrape the sides with a spoon until clean. Tip this sweet liquid into a large pan. (If you’re not finishing off a tin, simply measure two or three spoonfuls of syrup into a pan and add 100ml hot water instead.) Sprinkle in the sugar and salt, set the pan on a medium heat and swirl (rather than stir) the pan occasionally, until the sugar and salt dissolve.Leave the syrup to bubble gently without touching it, then, once you see the sugar at the base of the pan start to colour, swirl again so the mix caramelises evenly. Once it’s golden brown, take the pan off the heat and carefully pour in the double cream (the caramel will bubble up, so stand back), then stir to make a smooth sauce. Add the butter and vanilla, if using, and stir again until glossy. Serve hot or transfer to a bowl and leave to cool.Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5, and core the apples. In a bowl, mash the sultanas, sugar, butter and cinnamon, then press this mixture into the hollow of each apple. Sit each apple in a hole of a muffin tray, to catch all the juices, then bake for 25–30 minutes, until tender when pierced with the tip of a knife. Serve warm topped with some toffee sauce and perhaps a spoonful of cream or ice-cream.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteDessertBakingFruitSauces and graviesBonfire NightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The idea of combining a Korean preservation method with a French technique is exactly what I love about creativity in the kitchen. This mirepoix kimchi is not just a fun ferment to dot on savoury oatmeal or eat alongside cheese, but it also acts as the backbone for a plant-based, umami-filled chilli.Mirepoix kimchi (pictured top)This versatile, umami-rich paste is a twist on the classic mirepoix and can be used to add a hit of flavour to everything from soups to marinades, or even enjoyed as is.Prep10 minFerment2weeks+Makes500ml jar150g carrot150g white onion150g celery13½g salt(or 3% of the total weight of the first three ingredients)½tbsp red miso,or fish sauce½tbsp sugar15g gochugaru chilli flakesRoughly chop the vegetables (there is no need to peel the carrots if they have been rinsed), then put them in a food processor. Add the remaining ingredients and blitz to a rough paste.Decant the paste into a sterilised 500ml jar and pack it down to ensure there are no air pockets; there may not be much brine, so to minimise oxygen exposure, lay a piece of greaseproof paper on top of the mirepoix to act as a barrier.Seal the jar and leave to ferment at room temperature and out of direct sunlight for at least two weeks. At the two-week mark, start tasting the kimchi and, once you’re happy with the flavour and tang, store the jar in the fridge.Vegetarian umami chilliView image in fullscreenKenji Morimoto’s vegetarian umami chilli.This plant-based chilli is a powerhouse of flavour, thanks to the mirepoix kimchi and miso offering layers of heat and umami.

This is a quiet ode to them. Then, there’s a deep, buttery richness to pistachios that comes out best when they’re finely ground with flour – the oils release, the texture softens and the flavour becomes more pronounced; the addition of just a little matcha brings a quiet bitterness and depth, enough to hold its own without overpowering. It’s a loaf that feels composed – not flashy, but quietly fragrant with just the right amount of earthiness.Pistachio and matcha loaf cake (pictured top)This cake is close-crumbed and tender, and finished with a thin glaze of matcha icing that sets to a soft, pale-green sheen.Prep5 minCook1 hr 10 min, plus coolingMakes1450gloaf150g plainflour4g baking powder100g shelled pistachios3g matcha powder2g fine sea salt150g golden castersugar150g plant-based milk20g olive oilFor the matcha icing30g cocoa butter(deodorised)20g groundnutoil100g icingsugar2g matcha powder,plus extra for sprinklingHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and put a shelf in the middle of the oven. Line a 450g loaf tin with baking paper, so it overhangs slightly to help with easy removal of the cake later.Put the flour, baking powder, pistachios, matcha and salt in a food processor and pulse until the pistachios are finely ground and the mixture begins to clump together slightly. This clumping indicates that the oils from the pistachios have been released and are evenly distributed through the dry ingredients.Pour the sugar, milk and oil into the food processor and pulse again to combine, scraping down the sides to make sure everything gets nicely incorporated. You can also transfer the dry ingredients to a bowl and whisk in the sugar, milk and oil with a balloon whisk until the batter is smooth and lump-free. Take care not to overmix, but do make sure that all the dry ingredients are fully incorporated and there are no streaks.Pour the batter into the prepared tin and spread it out evenly with a spatula so it has a smooth top. Bake for 45–50 minutes, or until the top is golden and a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Don’t open the oven until at least 35 minutes have passed, otherwise the cake might collapse. The cake should rise slightly and feel springy to the touch.Remove, leave to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then use the paper overhang to lift it out. Gently peel off the paper, then put on a rack to cool completely.Meanwhile, make the icing. Melt the cocoa butter in a saucepan on a low heat, then add the oil, icing sugar and matcha and whisk to make a smooth, glossy glaze.Pour the glaze over the top of the cooled cake on its rack – if need be, use a dry pastry brush to spread it over the cake – then leave at room temperature to set.The cake can now be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to three days. For longer storage, wrap it tightly in clingfilm and freeze for up to three months. Defrost at room temperature.Light fruit cakeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Matt Russell/Quadrille.

The rum is there, too, but only just. This is a fruit cake for people who don’t like fruit cake: light, fragrant and impossible not to finish.

(If you’re short on time, microwave the raisins and rum in a covered dish for 30 seconds, then let them sit for 30 minutes to absorb the liquid.)To make the batter, heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and put a shelf in the middle of the oven. Line a 450g loaf tin with baking paper, ensuring it extends slightly over the edges – this will help with easy removal of the cake once baked.Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a large bowl. In a second bowl or jug, whisk the milk, oil, sugar, orange zest and vanilla, mixing until the sugar starts to dissolve. Add the wet ingredients to the dry, then fold in gently until just combined and there are no streaks.Drain any excess rum from the raisins, then fold them into the batter along with the candied orange pieces and cranberries, so the fruit is evenly distributed throughout the batter.Pour the batter into the prepared tin, then spread it out evenly with a spatula. Bake for 40–45 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.Remove, leave to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then lift it out using the paper overhang to help you. Transfer to a rack and leave to cool completely.Meanwhile, make the icing. Mix the sugar, rum and water in a small bowl or jug until fully combined and smooth. Once the cake is cool, use a pastry brush generously to dab or brush the glaze over the entire cake, then leave to set for 30-60 minutes.

They’ll struggle or die,” says the horticulturistEllen Mary Webster.“For a bright, sunny spot, go for crassula or strelitzia,” Webster suggests. Both thrive in bright, indirect light. Place acrassulaon a south-facing windowsill, or make astrelitziaa living room centrepiece once it grows tall.If you have a shady room, trya ZZ plant(Zamioculcas zamiifolia) – they are hardy, low-maintenance and thrive almost anywhere in your home.Epipremnum aureum, better known as devil’s ivy, is another beginner-friendly option. It’shardy and popular, and will stay green even in low light. “It grows quickly, propagates easily and is very low-maintenance,” says the houseplant influencer Julz Morris, who shares her plant tips on social media under the name Plantzbab.Attend a plant swapView image in fullscreenBring your plants and cuttings to a swap – and take home something you don’t already have.Photograph: Another Plant SwapIf you are looking to expand your houseplant collection on a budget, a plant swap is a great weekend activity. These community events let people trade healthy unwanted plants or cuttings and head home with something new.Lisa, who runs an event calledAnother Plant Swap, has turned her passion for houseplants into a nationwide community. What began with 30 people in London in 2022 has grown into regular swaps across the UK. “It’s an event where everyone’s welcome,” she says. “People come to exchange tips, swap plants and connect with fellow plant lovers.”Tickets for plant swaps are often free or under £20, with many including goodie bags, raffle entries or even a drink in the price. Local swap groups are easy to find on Facebook, such as Hackney and East London Plant Swap or South Manchester Garden Plant Swap.If there’s nothing nearby, why not host your own with friends? Charities such as Oxfam offer free resources to help, including digital promotional tools, gardening tips and a downloadable poster.Grow things you can eatThere’s nothing more satisfying than eating something you have grown yourself, even if it starts on a windowsill. To succeed indoors, think like a gardener. “Most edible plants prefer growing outside, so it’s about recreating their environment indoors,” says Webster. That might mean avoiding draughts and radiators.Kim Stoddart, the editor of Amateur Gardening magazine and author of The Climate Change-Resilient Vegetable Garden, recommends loose-leaf salads such as “salad bowl” lettuce and rocket, and brassica leaves such as perpetual spinach and flat-leaf kale. These are all easy, low-maintenance edibles, ideal for winter windowsill gardening.You can also experiment with growing things on, such as shop-bought celery and spring onions. And if you have a garden, it’s possible to bring plants indoors for the winter. “Try rooting some mint in water,” Stoddart says. “Bush chilli plants can be cut back and overwintered inside as lovely houseplants.”View image in fullscreenKim Stoddart recommends trying ‘salad bowl’ lettuce and rocket on your windowsill.Photograph: Kim StoddartTo keep costs down, see if your area has local seed banks, such as the London Freedom Seed Bank or North Tyneside Seed Swap. Even odd or out-of-date seeds can thrive indoors.Divide and ruleSupermarket herbs are an affordable way to add a bit of greenery, and flavour, to your kitchen – a pot of basil costs about £1.50, compared with £5 to £10 from a garden centre – but they are not always built to last.“Supermarket herbs have numerous seeds all crammed into one small pot,” says Webster. “They look full, but it’s essentially lots squeezed together, which makes it hard to keep them alive for another harvest.”To make them go further, she recommends dividing them straight away into several pots so each plant has room to grow.If that sounds like too much effort, opt for nursery herbs instead. They are better cared for and more likely to thrive once you bring them home.Take cuttingsPropagating your own plants is one of the easiest and cheapest ways to grow your collection. “Don’t be afraid – take the cutting, it’s free!” says Webster. “Many houseplants can be rooted in water, while others prefer division, so double check which you have first.”Monstera and pothos are particularly easy to propagate from cuttings. Simply snip below a node – the bit where the leaves grow on the stem – and place the cutting in clean water. “The roots grow so fast, and in a clear vase they look stunning as they develop, and can double as a centrepiece,” says Webster. Once established, transfer them into well-drained compost.View image in fullscreenMonstera is easy to propagate from cuttings.Photograph: MmeEmil/Getty ImagesTo propagate the devil’s ivy, snip above the node, pop the cutting in water, and once the roots reach a few inches, transfer it into a chunky houseplant mix. This type of mix – containing bark, perlite and charcoal – improves drainage and helps prevent root rot.A healthyaloe vera,spider plantormoney plantwill produce “babies” that can be potted up once they have formed roots, whilecalatheasandsnake plantscan be divided and repotted.When taking cuttings, patience pays off. “Always let the wound dry before putting a cutting into soil or water. This reduces the risk of the cutting rotting before being able to put out any roots,” says Morris.Buy sustainablyThe biggest way to waste money is buying plants that aren’t right for your environment. They’ll struggle or dieEllen Mary Webster, horticulturistBefore heading to a garden centre, take a look at your local community of plant sellers. Independent nurseries, weekend markets and pop-up events often offer affordable, ethically sourced plants, cuttings and accessories. Car boot sales, Facebook groups and local plant fairs are also great places to find unique greenery without breaking the bank.Green Rooms Market, run by the plant experts Sarah Gerrard-Jones and Ian Morrison, brings together small businesses and the wider plant communities across Bristol, London and Margate. “It’s a social event, with talks, traders selling houseplants, live demonstrations on repotting, and an ‘ask the expert’ corner for plant care advice,” says Gerrard-Jones.Events like these are a great way to support independent sellers and pick up unusual species you won’t find in supermarkets or chain stores.View image in fullscreen‘You can make your own potting mix,’ says Joe Bagley, the Houseplant Doctor.Photograph: Daniel Balakov/Getty ImagesUse the right soilHealthy plants start with healthy soil. “You can make your own potting mix using houseplant-labelled compost,” says Joe Bagley, AKAthe Houseplant Doctor. A 10-litre bag costs about £5 to £10 from most supermarkets or garden centres.For tropical plants, Bagley suggests adding bark and perlite. For cacti and succulents, use perlite and grit. Perlite will cost you about £1 a litre (about £10.99 a bag) from most garden centres.For smaller collections, a ready-made mix from a garden centre can be more cost-effective. Skip outdoor or general-purpose compost as “it can bring in flies, mushrooms and weeds”, Bagley says.Save on potsThe plastic containers that plants are often sold in, known as nursery pots, are typically designed for short-term use and can easily crack. But decorative plant pots don’t have to cost a fortune. Charity shops, car boot sales and online marketplaces such as eBay are full of affordable finds. And, with a bit of creativity, almost anything can become a planter.“I have a couple of nice pots, but most of mine come from charity shops,” says Morris. “I also like to repurpose objects like hair-dye pots and empty candle jars.”View image in fullscreen‘Look for salvaged items around the home,’ says Kim Stoddart.Photograph: Kim StoddartStoddart is partial to a “jug garden”, having planted edibles in everything from old wellies and watering cans to small kitchen bins and bowls. “You could use an old veg tray for microgreens, or look for salvaged items around the home,” she says.Opt for pots with drainage holes and place them on saucers – you can find multipacks for under £5 at shops such as Wilko or B&Q. Or simply use old plates or plastic containers.Avoid repotting into containers more than one size larger than the plant. Excess soil can trap water, leading to root rot, which shows up as wilting, yellowing leaves or black, mushy roots.Explore more on these topicsHouseplantsMoney hacksInteriorsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I write “camouflage” in inverted commas because it was blue and, amid the dusty devastation of Gaza, there was nothing about it – or the bumbag he wore with it – that helped Witkoff blend in.It’s an odd paradox that a pattern designed to melt military personnel into their surroundings – the word is derived from the Frenchcamoufler, “to disguise” – when worn by certain people, in certain ways, does the opposite. Witkoff being a glaring example.But camouflage is chameleon-like. Militaristic or pacifist, Britpop or British army, there’s arguably no pattern that has a more functional original purpose or greater adaptability when deployed far from the battlefield. Context is king and camouflage reads wildly differently when itappears on a tieworn by the hawkish veteran and “secretary of war” Pete Hegseth, on the Louis Vuitton catwalk, in the fields of Glastonbury or even at a protest against conflict: one person’s sabre rattling is another’s anti-war statement.It is perhaps its adaptability that means it has moments, such as now, of increased popularity. Style-wise it’s a symptom of the throwback-Y2K moment and, from Gap to Next, Damson Madder to JW Anderson, it’snotblending in everywhere. In the US, hunting camo has been spottedadorning everythingfrom Kamala Harris and Tim Walz baseball caps to rightwing libertarians.On the one hand camo is,says Vogue, “a stylish alternative to denim”, available at democratically low prices, as well as a relatively sustainable option – the likes of eBay are awash with camo clothing. On the other hand, it isn’tjusta pattern in the way of gingham or paisley – the rise of camouflage was a symptom of theincreased destructiveness of modern warfare, and even today its military associations are so entrenched that in certain countries it’s not allowed to be worn by non-military personnel. In several Caribbean nations, for instance, it’s prohibited other than for active members of the police or military. The South African National Defence Force recentlyissueda warningto the public to stop wearing its camouflage.For civilians, there are statements to be madebecauseof its military associations: a countercultural vibe is what brought camouflage to the backs of Vietnam war protesters and Jimi Hendrix. Pacifists wearing it are leveraging its military footing. For others, such as the formerMoschino designer Jeremy Scott, “camo is a classic, no different than plaid or polka dots”. Even Claudia sodding Winkleman has worn it in the past. It can, no doubt, be fun to wear – I would know, having spent the late 90s singing along to Never Ever in All Saints-inspired camo combats.It feels natural that it’s having, for want of a better word, this moment. The world feels tumultuous. It perhaps always has done. But there’sevidence to suggestit is increasingly turbulent – one nonprofit organisation recently estimated that in the past five years global conflict had doubled, and that one in eight people worldwide had been exposed to it.There are devastating conflicts taking place in the midst of civilian populations, in the cities of Sudan and Ukraine and in Gaza. In the US, troops are being deployed to city streets in unprecedented ways, inspiringa recent New York Times piecedelineating the different camouflage uniforms of the federal forces, from the national guard to ICE.Fashion, both in the sense of what is sent down the catwalks but also in the everyday – the person picking up a camo jacket from army surplus or Depop – is in communication with all of this, whether consciously or subliminally. Look to Elsa Schiaparelli, who presented a military-themed collection in the run-up to war being declared in 1930s France. Fashion loves drama, and nothing, tragically, is more dramatic than war.Civilians wanting to wear camo could be responding to a scary world, knowingly nodding to it; they could be making a pointed anti-war statement or one of battle-readiness even while picking up a pint of milk. But, in an increasingly divided world, how it might be received feels more and more blurry.And the idea of wearing, for fun, a print designed to help people avoid detection is an added complication when you consider it through the lens of those living in conflict zones who really are unable to hide.More broadly, the politics of who gets to wear civilian or military garb feels increasingly fraught – look at the political fights overVolodymyr Zelenskyy’s military-style outfitsand his decision to not wear civilian suits until war in his country is over. Melania Trump’s military-style get-ups can feel uncomfortably close to martial cosplay, such as the time she wore a “dictator chic”Alexander McQueen khaki green suitto the 2020 Republican national convention.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was the subject of a New York Times piece last summer in which the fashion critic Vanessa Friedman said she was officially changing her stance on it. The last time shereceived a queryasking: “Can I still wear camo?” was in 2021, just after the Capitol insurrection – a number of those in the mob were wearing it. At the time, she suggested camo was OK as long as it was clearly a fashion item and didn’t look like a uniform. This year, however, she said she was changing her advice on the basis of respect for the military, having received a letter from a veteran who called the fashion choice “akin to stolen valour”. But also, the state of the world. As Friedman put it: “Wearing camouflage as a fashion statement seems like an increasingly tone-deaf and potentially dangerous choice.”All of which is to say that camouflage is complicated and the very context making it feel relevant is also what is making it feel especially loaded. Do I think it’s inappropriate? No. Do I wantthis camo T-shirtbut think I might feel a bit icky wearing it?

Here is a barrier-protecting peptide moisturiser, makeup primer, antioxidant and SPF50 all in one cream. Uniquely, it needs only one application to maintain eight hours of UV protection thanks to new encapsulated filters. I must forewarn you that the resulting texture is at first unfamiliar and, frankly, a bit weird in terms of fingertip feel. But it took me only two tries to get over it.

The cream, too, is gorgeous, and likely to be loved by sensitive and reactive skins unable to tolerate punchier active ingredients.

As if to ram home the point, they decorated an entire chapel with bones dug up from the town’s overflowing cemeteries. The sign outside theChapel of Bonesroughly translates as “We bones in here wait for yours to join us”. Cheerful lot, those monks. Columns, walls, arches – all are covered in skulls, tibias, fibulas, clavicles. Rapt, I can’t stop staring, then start to chuckle when I see skulls curving round frilly frescoes of cherubim on vaulted ceilings, a whimsical touch of chintz among the ghoulishness.Evora locator map for PortugalÉvora has me in its grip even before I come to the Chapel of Bones. This former royal city of Portuguese kings and capital of the Alentejo region has so many architectural and cultural treasures wedged within its historical centre that it’s often referred to as a living museum. But in a museum, you generally have to keep your voice down: here in Évora, there’s the buzz you get with 11,000 university students roaming round a Unesco world heritage site old town that’s encased within medieval walls.I feel a pang of envy when I visit the 16th-centuryCollege of the Holy Spiritwithin the University of Évora, which is open to the public willing to pay €3 and take pot luck as to which of the ridiculously beautiful classrooms are free at that moment. My guide, Andre Birken, came to Évora from Germany as an Erasmus student years ago and decided to stay. Chilly northern Germany or laid-back southern Portugal, where even in late October it’s still 23C? Bit of a no-brainer, he tells me. He shows me classrooms decorated in the azulejo tiles for which Portugal is renowned, and where, if the lecture gets dull, you can lose yourself in bucolic blue-and-white scenes.The ancient Romans, rather than the Greeks, left their mark on Évora in a more monumental style, including an enormousaqueductthat’s one of the first things visitors see as they approach the city. Rising in the centre of the old town are the 14 graceful Corinthian columns of theRoman temple built for emperor Augustusaround the 1st century AD (and not, as is commonly assumed, dedicated to the goddess Diana). Surrounding it are buildings that typify most of the architecture here – low-slung, whitewashed, trimmed in ochre and usually sporting wrought-iron balconies. One of them is my hotel, a 15th-century former convent turned into the Pousada del Convento Évora. Every cobbled lane in the old town has this same style of architecture, and I find its uniformity immensely pleasing and harmonious – the white reflecting the sun, the mustardy ochre reminding me of the landscapes of the Alentejo around me, whose brownness is dotted with olive groves and cork forests.View image in fullscreenThe Chapel of Bones.Photograph: Sirbouman/AlamyAnd vineyards, of course, all of them blazing with autumnal colours. Alentejo is one of Portugal’s major wine regions, and its subregion of Baixo Alentejo will be2026’s European Wine City. About 10 minutes’ drive from Évora isFitapreta Winery, the brainchild of the innovative Portuguese winemaker António Maçanita and the British viticulturist David Booth. In 2015, Maçanita bought an old fortified manor house that had been in the same family since the 14th century, resurrecting ancient grape varieties, planting new vineyards and sticking to organic production. It’s an idyllic spot for a leisurely wine-tasting, followed by an even more leisurely lunch.Within the modern winery (its facade clad in cork in a nod to Portugal’s millions of cork forests), André Alves leads me through a tasting of five of the winery’s 22 varieties – all indigenous. A deliciously bone-dry rosé (amusingly named Freshly Squeezed), a fresh-tasting orange-type wine that technically wasn’t an orange wine (A Laranja Mecânica) and the very elegant red Enxarrama all made me wish I had room to stash these in my luggage.View image in fullscreenHeavenly … Azulejo tiles in the University of Évora.Photograph: Geogphotos/AlamyThis is only the preamble. Sommelier Francisco Cunha of the winery’sA Cozinha do Paço restaurantthen guides me into the part of the manor house that was originally the chapel, and whose galleried upper floor is one of the many atmospheric spots where they serve a seven-course lunch that deserves some serious Michelin attention. Braised fennel and a gorgeous sheep’s milk cheese sauce with turbot, and the famed black pig of the Alentejo paired with a cauliflower cream quenelle were exquisite.In fact, excellent food is a given in Alentejo. AtEnoteca Cartuxanear the Roman temple, they serve their own wines to go with plates of thin buttery slices of cured black pig and chorizo; not to mention the sublime Monte da Vinha sheep’s milk cheese that’s as gooey and as good as an Époisses. The venerableRestaurante Fialhocomes out with classic Alentejo dishes done expertly: pigs’ cheeks braised in red wine melt in the mouth, and pork and clams unite in a piquant red peppery stew.Évora’s food and wine alone make it a worthy holder of the2027 European Capital of Culturetitle, even without its architectural marvels. Then again, Évora Cathedral is magnificent, with a typical mishmash of architectural styles, from romanesque and gothic to Renaissance and baroque. From here, it’s almost a rite of passage to walk down the narrow pedestrianised Rua Cinco de Outubro and its souvenir and craft shops wedged into white and yellow houses. Yes, it’s touristy, but delightful nonetheless, with cork handbags and ceramics actually made in Portugal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is the spot for lazy and mild autumn mornings with a coffee and apastel de natacustard tart or a cheesy tart calledqueijada de Évora, before heading off in search of more of the town’s oddities.Explore Portugal’s historic hilltop hamlets in a free electric hire carRead moreOne in particular catches my eye: the row of very cute houses built under the 16th-century aqueduct Água de Prata, in the north-western part of the old town. I need more time here, yet I end up following the tourist trail out of Évora for a morning in the hilltop village of Monsaraz, right by the Spanish border. Here, in this all-white village, where craft boutiques and wine shops attract the tourists, it feels less real, more toytown. It’s all very pretty, and I even get a closer look at the beaches of Alqueva, western Europe’s largest artificial lake, just outside the village.But I was missing Évora, which manages to hold on to its mellowness despite the growing number of tourists. I recall a chat with my guide, Andre, who mentioned the number of people who take day trips from Lisbon (only 90-odd minutes away) and tour groups who stop for a night or two. But they need four, five days, maybe a week, he says, to get the most out of it. I’m inclined to agree, as these too-short days fly by and I don’t get round to following the nature trails out of the town, or visiting all of the museums, or having another lazy coffee and eating apastel de natain the sunshine. Those monks were right: life really is too short.The trip was provided byKirker Holidays, which has three-night breaks atPousada Convento Évorain November from £819pp, including breakfast, car hire and flights, although rail options are also available.

In 2015, Country Life magazine created a list ofthe 39 attributes that make a modern gentleman, and we lightly pulled them apart, remember?Oh, no, this is completely different. You see, Country Life magazine has created a list ofthe 39 attributes that make a modern gentleman…That’s exactly the same!No it isn’t, because that was a decade ago. The 2015 rules are completely obsolete now. For example, one of them was “Cooks an omelette to die for” and another was “Is good with waiters”. Preposterously outdated stuff.Fine, so what are the 2025 rules?Well, one of them is: “Can poach and scramble eggs without fuss”. Another is “Learns and uses waiters’ names”.Ohwow, yes, extremely different.Listen, do you really expect a complete overhaul of the entire definition of gentlemanliness every single decade? Hardly. There’s something inherently timeless about being a gentleman, and that mainly has to do with cooking eggs and not being rude to restaurant employees.There must be something new, though.Oh yes – the thing about not wearing a tank top to the gym is one of them.Surely that’s less about being a gentleman and more about not wanting to look like a sweatyidiot.Or there’s this one: “Never runs for things in public”.Anything? What if your dog was chasing some deer through a park?If you’re a gentleman, you’ll remain at walking pace. The deer will appreciate your panache. How about this one: “Believes Roger Moore was the best 007”.That’s not gentlemanly, that’s just contrarian pub talk.And these: “Is pathologically punctual”, “Knows when to call it a night”, and “Doesn’t modify restaurant orders”.Actually, those do all sound quite reasonable.To be a modern gentleman is to be able to go about things with the minimum level of fuss. Efficient, friendly, confident – that’s what makes a gentleman.That and having a terrible opinion about long-running spy franchises.Well, yes, that too. But you must remember, the final rule of being a modern gent is: “Doesn’t take anything too seriously”.Consider me educated. Same time in 2035, then?Absolutely. Brace yourself for rules like “Doesn’t exclusively use AI to communicate with loved ones” and “Can smile at strangers regardless of their position on the class war that has definitely engulfed the planet by now”.And something about being able to cook an egg.Of course.

She discusses sexism, success and why she won’t be stripping off on social mediaWed 5 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 08.20 ESTShareFamke Janssen is dressed for her photoshoot at the Covent Garden hotel exactly as her character, Betty, would dress in the new Netflix crime drama Amsterdam Empire – lacy and floral but tailored and mini, with long school socks. Is the look sexy in a sardonic way, or irony expressed through fashion? We spend a lot of time, one way or another, talking about objectification, the beauty myths of the patriarchy, the collateral damage of the self – sexism, basically. Janssen has been in more than 60 films across a 30-year career, and before that, she was a model. There’s a lot to talk about.So it hardly seems the time to mention how smoking she looks; her face as flawless and cheekboney at 60 as it was nearly 30 years ago, in the 1995James Bondfilm GoldenEye. It’s almost unnerving – if she were a man, I would mention it without hesitation. She puts it down to clean living: “I get judged very quickly, that I must have had work, which I haven’t. We shame women into it, and then we shame women when they do it. I support everyone’s decision to do whatever they want, it’s just not my cup of tea.”I look strong, I am strong. I come from a background of strong womenAmsterdam Empire is the first production she has ever made in her home country, the Netherlands, and the first time she has acted in Dutch. Roles have come up in the past, not least because she has two sisters in the business – Marjolein Beumer, an actor, and Antoinette Beumer, a director – but nothing was quite right. “Then Netflix came to me with this pitch – it’s The War of the Roses [the 1989 film rather than the historical to-do] meets The Sopranos,” she says. OK, yes and no: that’s definitely the story – Jack, played by Jacob Derwig, is the kingpin of a cannabis empire that is legal on the surface but not beneath. He kicks off the series by walking out on Betty, a show-stopping beauty and one-hit-wonder pop star of yore, who will absolutely not go down without a fight.It’s a new era for Netflix: if they make a show in a different territory, it’s authentic to that place. Amsterdam Empire feels very original, without template. The dialogue is exhilaratingly blunt. It’s raunchy but so frank and un-euphemised that, even while watching the divorce play out in a strip club, on a bucking bronco in the shape of a giant penis, you’re not remotely reminded of sex.View image in fullscreenNot going down without a fight … Janssen, right, with Jacob Derwig in Amsterdam Empire.Photograph: NetflixBut the beating heart is the subtle shift of allegiance – Betty enters the show as an eccentric who has been cast aside, while Jack’s the romantic hero with a new love interest. She’s the one who steadily, and completely, wins the room. “We know nothing about Betty,” Janssen says; “we know everything about Jack. So I said, ‘It’s not a fair fight.’ The fact that Betty doesn’t have a child, she doesn’t have a family member. She doesn’t have a friend. She has a dog that she has to steal, and she has her husband. When I read that character, I thought: ‘OK, I will do what I can to make this well-rounded. If I don’t get it on the page, I’m going to put it in my acting.” In many ways, it’s the job she was born to do – “I’ve made a career out of playing women who are underwritten.”Janssen was born in Amstelveen, near Amsterdam, into a hardscrabble existence that she describes quite elliptically but doesn’t gloss. “From a young age, we were left to fend for ourselves,” she says. “There were a lot of things going on, there was drama. I realised, if I don’t look after myself, this isn’t going to end well.” She was considered the intellectual one of the three sisters, so wasn’t encouraged to do anything creative, and ended up studying economics, “because I had a science teacher, who said to the class, to everyone, ‘Oh, girls don’t understand science.’ A whole few years of my life were derailed, just to prove this man wrong.”She started work young, taking any job she could find – delivering newspapers, working in bars, in shops, “anything to earn my own money, to have my own freedom”. She left home at 17, to become a model, and “it was only leaving the Netherlands, coming to the US, that I learned to dream, learned to create what I wanted to create. It was a whole different culture, where I had permission.”View image in fullscreen‘I was very aware of the pitfalls of being a model-turned-actor-turned-Bond girl’ … Janssen photographed in London.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianWhen you look at pictures of those modelling days – there’s aswimwear shootwith Janssen and Elle Macpherson that is so quintessentially 80s it’s like time-travelling – there is something culturally contradictory about them. The look was incredibly strong. This was before “heroin chic” and waifery; the archetype was physically robust, yet at the same time, there seemed to be an unspoken rule of, “Please, nobody ask these women to say anything, they’re better when you just look at them.”“For me,” she says, “that’s been the biggest challenge, because I’m so strong. I look strong, I am strong. I come from a background of strong women. I’m not going to play some idiot in front of a male producer or director to get what I want. But I feel that might be the way some people would go about it – because otherwise, if you go in too hard there, you know you’re being labelled at every turn, and you don’t get anything.”Janssen needed to put clear blue water between the modelling and her acting ambitions, and went to Columbia University in New York to study creative writing and literature, with film studies as a minor. She didn’t get her first acting role until she was 28, and then GoldenEye came along in 1995, when she was 30. Xenia Onatopp was, perhaps, not an obvious choice of role. “I was very aware,” she says, “of the pitfalls of being a model-turned-actor-turned-Bond girl. I thought ‘Bond girl’ was such a demeaning term. But I thought: ‘I have nothing to lose; if I do this, I’m going to go all the way.’ So I came up with a lot of the things that are now in the film, because I wanted to make a memorable character, not play her the way she was written.”Onatopp has been so deeply analysed, not just as a moment of Bond girl resurgence in the franchise – a move away from interchangeable damsels towards women who could crush you with their thighs, and whose only distress would be if they laddered their tights – but also for what, if any, statement it made about feminism as dominance, sadism as a baton passing from the male to the female. It got a bit heated, put it that way. Surely Onatopp was always written as a woman who gets off on thigh-crushing men to death?View image in fullscreen‘This time, Mr Bond, the pleasure will be all mine’ … Janssen as Xenia Onatopp in GoldenEye.Photograph: Eon Productions/United Artists/Allstar“I brought a lot that was not on the page,” says Janssen. “Things like the way she’s so orgasmic. I grew up on Bond movies, because my dad used to like them, and so I always thought of them as comedies, as tongue-in-cheek. I thought: ‘Let me make this character unforgettable.’ I went for broke. It easily could have failed. I don’t know where I got the confidence.”It was a success, no question – but the knock-on effect was that “after that, the offers that were coming in were any woman with a gun, standing around. Between my name, Famke Janssen, and having played a Russian, Xenia Onatopp, they didn’t know what to do with me except make me a foreigner who was bad.”It wasn’t what she wanted, and she fought instead to get a part that genuinely wasn’t very large, in the 1997 neo-noir City of Industry, starring Harvey Keitel. “It’s an American woman. She works in a supermarket. She has no money. She lives in this shitty little house. It took a lot to get that part, because Harvey initially just saw this glamorous person, with my background – well-travelled, whatever. He didn’t see me, he sawthis.”She gestures at herself, and of course I know what she means – star-power personified.“And I thought: ‘But that’s not my background.’ I came to the audition dressed like a checkout girl, thinking: don’t judge a book by its cover, let me go for this, it’s interesting.”View image in fullscreen‘Obviously, in the late 80s as a model, the 90s as an actor, I’ve seen things.’Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianFrom there, she went on to small-to-middling parts in left-field or breakout movies, not always (but very often) with sterling directors, Robert Altman (in 1998’s The Gingerbread Man) andWoody Allen(in Celebrity, the same year) among them. “I wanted to use this moment that I had after GoldenEye to go against type, make less money, not become famous. Just become known as someone who showed up and could do different things, play different characters.”She’s very complimentary about Allen, which feels like a blast from the past, as nobody talks about him now except in conjunction with the allegation that surrounds him (which he has always denied).“I thought, having watched so many Woody Allen movies, that he would tell people to act a certain way, because most of his leading actors become a version of Woody Allen,” she says. “But it doesn’t work like that at all. He says very little. He lets people do what they want to do. And if he doesn’t like it, he just fires them and replaces them with someone else. We always had this feeling that we might be next.” It sounds kind of Stalinist. “He’s not a tyrant. Soon-Yi seemed like she was wearing the pants.” (Soon-Yi was, of course, the adopted daughter of Mia Farrow; Allen had been in a relationship with Farrow for 12 years, until he left her for Soon-Yi in 1992.)There’s a lot in here – there were allegations that Allen sexually assaulted his daughter, Dylan, but charges were never brought after two investigations cleared him, plus counter-allegations that Farrow was abusive, which Farrow says “were completely made up”. The whole situation with Soon-Yi was widely considered so icky by the late 90s (she was 21 when they got together, he in his mid-50s) that it was safer just to back away from the whole situation and never mention Allen again. Which is all relevant to Janssen in so far as she genuinely doesn’t care how things sound – she just says what she sees.“Obviously, in the late 80s as a model, the 90s as an actor, I’ve seen things. I’ve seen people enable things. Harvey Weinstein would never have gone on for as long as he did without the people around him.” She made movies with Weinstein but was never harassed by him. “I think people would never dare, with me.” What, because you’re tall? “I’m tall, I’m outspoken, I don’t fall for that type of behaviour. I’m not blaming any victims in this situation, but yes, I was unscathed in those areas.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m excited that I was part of it’ … Janssen as Dr Jean Grey, with James Marsden as Scott Summers, in X-Men: The Last Stand (2006).Photograph: 20th Century Fox/AllstarOf course, you don’t actually have to have been sexually assaulted to have been diminished by the sexist standards of this era. Janssen made two films with Jon Favreau, Love and Sex (2000) and Made (2001); whenhe gaily saidin an interview about her that, “It’s very rare to see someone who’s beautiful and funny,” it was accepted that was just the kind of thing cool guys said. “Look at the 1920s, the 30s,” Janssen says, a bit resignedly. “All those beautiful women in screwball comedies were geniuses. People are just largely not aware of the sexism that’s prevailing in our lives. We take things for granted, when we shouldn’t.”In 2000 came the role of Dr Jean Grey in X-Men, which would go on for years, though later only as a cameo. “Until X-Men, everything [in superhero films], from production design to costume design to the performances, had been very glossy and unrealistic. And X-Men changed that. I’m actually excited that I was part of it, and it gave me all this work.“In the end, it’s a business,” she continues. “It’s not that I wouldn’t love to dabble in only my favourite projects with my favourite directors and actors, but it doesn’t work like that. Unless I have some type of relevance, which I think I’ve pushed to the limit by remaining out of the press for as long as I have, I won’t get work.”She stays off social media because she finds it a bit unseemly: “I certainly was not going to do what a lot of the rest of the world and a lot of women seem to be doing, which is photographing themselves half naked on Instagram, screaming for attention. It’s just not who I am.” She thinks, maybe rightly, that she’d be in hotter demand if she had more of a profile. But, as a counterpoint, I think if we’d known these past 30 years how straight-talking she was, we’d have been bugging her for an answer to everything.Amsterdam Empire is streaming on NetflixThis article was amended on 5 November 2025 to remove some text for editorial reasons.Explore more on these topicsFilmSuperhero moviesWoody AllenJames BondTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The arrest was made “given that sufficient evidence was established to support the charges”, the statement added.Najim is wanted by the ICC for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, as well as alleged rape and murder.He was arrested in Turin after attending a football match before being released and repatriated. Italy’s prime minister,Giorgia Meloni, said he had been quickly repatriated because he was considered a risk to Italy’s national security.Critics accused her administration of pandering to Libya because of its reliance on the north African country to stem the flow of migration towards Italy’s southern shores.The ICC saidItalyhad failed in its obligations under the Rome statute, the court’s founding treaty, to execute the warrant and surrender Najim while he was on Italian territory.The case prompted Rome prosecutorsto investigate Meloniand three other government officials on suspicion of aiding and abetting a crime and embezzlement of public funds over use of the air force jet, although they were later cleared.In May, Libya accepted the authority of the ICC to investigate alleged war crimes in the country despite not being party to the Rome statute.Italian opposition parties reacted swiftly to news of Najim’s arrest, with the former prime minister and leader of the Five Star Movement Giuseppe Conte saying it was “a humiliation for the Meloni government”.Elly Schlein, leader of the Democratic party, said: “The Libyan authorities ordered Almasri’s arrest on charges of torture and murder … the same criminal that [the Italian government] freed and escorted home on a government flight. This is a disgrace at an international level for which our government must apologise to Italians.”Antonella Forattini, a Democratic party politician, said it was “a stain on our institutions and Italy’s image around the world”. She added: “Libya is now demonstrating that it is ahead of our country in defending justice and legality.”The case put the spotlight on a controversial pact between Italy and Libya, signed in 2017 and renewed every three years. The deal, approved by the European Council, involves Italy funding and equipping the Libyan coastguard to prevent boats of refugees leaving the north African country. Humanitarian groups have criticised it for pushing people back to detention camps, where they face torture and other abuses.Explore more on these topicsLibyaAfricaMiddle East and north AfricaItalyGiorgia MeloninewsShareReuse this content"

If they do this to the president, what happens to all the other women in the country?”Commentators said the incident showed that no woman was immune to sexual harassment inMexico.“Even if you’re the president, any guy believes he has the right to touch you,”saidCatalina Ruiz-Navarro, a journalist for the feminist outlet Volcánicas. “When they ask what the patriarchy is – this is it.”But the incident also highlighted the broader security risk that Sheinbaum faces on the street, given that her security detail was not clearly visible in the video and it took seconds for anyone to intervene.It comes just days after Carlos Alberto Manzo Rodríguez, a popular mayor,was killedat the Day of the Dead celebrations in Uruapan, in the state of Michoacán, by a gunman who shot him seven times at close range before being killed himself.In the months prior, Manzo Rodríguez had publicly appealed to Sheinbaum on social media for help to confront criminal groups in the region.1:34Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum addresses groping incident – videoManzo Rodríguez was only the latest official to be killed in Mexico, where37 candidateswere killed on the campaign trail before the election in June 2024, and another 10 municipal presidents have been killed since Sheinbaum’s government began on 1 October.Even though it is local authorities that are most frequently targeted in Mexico, high-level officials are not exempt from risk.In 1994, the presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta was gunned down at a rally in the border city of Tijuana. More recently, in 2020, the Jalisco cartel tried to assassinate Omar García Harfuch, Sheinbaum’s current security minister, riddling his convoy with bullets in the middle of Mexico City.Sheinbaum herself hada security scarelast year while campaigning in the state of Chiapas, when masked men stopped her vehicle to ask her to address the violence in the state, before letting her move on.Nonetheless, Sheinbaum has kept the habit of her popular predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who mingled with crowds and preferred a lighter degree of security, and said that she would not be changing her security arrangements.“We cannot distance ourselves from the people,” said Sheinbaum. “That would be to deny where we come from and who we are.”“Hopefully [the presidency will press charges], and the president will send a clear message: no man has the right to kiss or touch a woman without her consent,” wrote Alejandra Escobar, editorial director of Etcétera, a Mexican magazine,on X. “May this also serve as an example for [her assistants]: it is not acceptable for her to be so exposed.”Explore more on these topicsClaudia SheinbaumMexicoAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

It is a rupture – a generational shift taking place over a short period of time.”Before unveiling his economic vision for the country,Carney had repeatedly stressedthe need for Canada to seek out new markets astrade with the US stagnates, large corporations flee andtariffs batter key industries.As part of its huge spending plan, the Canadian government is increasing defence spending by C$84bn (US$59bn) over five years to combat an “increasingly dangerous and divided world”. Carney has previously pledged to meet Nato’s goal of spending 3.5% of gross domestic product on defense, but the spending document does little to indicate how close Canada is to meeting that target.The budget envisions a reduction to the federal workforce by 2028-29 that would bring the civil service to a size similar to what is was in 2021. The government plans changes to retirement rules – not firings – to achieve that goal.Trump raises tariffs on Canada by 10% in retaliation for anti-tariff TV adRead moreBut the costs associated with the capital spending needed to avoid a recession are laid out in the document.In last December’s fiscal update, the federal deficit was projected to be C$42.2bn in 2025-26. But the Liberal plan will run a deficit of C$78.3bn in 2025-26. The government says it will aim to reduce the federal deficit to C$56.6bn by 2029-30.The Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, quickly posted on social media that Carney had “nearly doubled [former prime minister Justin] Trudeau’s deficit and kept Liberal taxes on groceries, work, energy, and homebuilding”.Despite criticism from opposition parties that the budget goes both too far in its spending or not far enough, one Conservative lawmaker announced he would join the Liberal caucus.“Prime Minister Mark Carney is offering that path with a new budget that hits the priorities I have heard most in my riding, to build strong community infrastructure and grow a stronger economy. That is why I am joining the government caucus,” said Nova Scotia MP Chris d’Entremont, adding the move came after “thoughtful conversations with constituents and my family”.The floor crossing is a key win for Carney’s Liberals, who govern with a parliamentary minority. Until Tuesday, the party needed the support of three lawmakers from other parties to pass this budget and avoid an election. With d’Entremont now sitting with the Liberals, that figure drops to two.Parliament is expected to debate the budget for four days, before voting on the spending plan on 17 November.This article was corrected on 5 November 2025. Defence spending is due to increase by C$84bn, not C$8bn, over five years.Explore more on these topicsCanadaTrump tariffsMark CarneyTariffsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Holness, whose government set out credit and insurance provisions for a storm similar to last year’s Hurricane Beryl, said he was seeking financial support from regional allies, development agencies and the private sector.“Experts describe Melissa to be on the very edge of what is physically possible in the Atlantic Ocean, a storm powered by record sea temperatures,” he said. “Its force was so immense that seismographs hundreds of miles away registered its passage.”“Hurricane Melissa wasn’t only a tragedy: It was a warning.”Melissaslammed into Jamaica’s agricultural heartlands, already battered by last year’s Hurricane Beryl, which lawmakers said could push up the prices of food. It also tore through parts of the nation’s key tourism corridor.Lawmakers also said thousands of tourism workers were out of a job.1:22Jamaican farmers warn of food shortages after destruction of Hurricane Melissa – videoScientists say storms are intensifying faster as a result of greenhouse gas emissions warming ocean surfaces, piling up fuel for seasonal storms. Caribbean leaders have long called for reparations from wealthy heavy-polluting nations in the form of aid or debt relief.Holness pledged to rebuild infrastructure to withstand the worsening impacts of climate change, including moving parts of the electric grid underground. He also waived import taxes for some relief products such as solar panels and Starlink kits.“Every repaired bridge, re-roofed home and rebuilt road must be designed for the storms of tomorrow, not the storms of yesterday,” he said.By Tuesday, Melissa’s confirmed death toll climbed to 75, as Haiti’s official count climbed to 43, with 13 more missing, adding to the 32 confirmed deaths in Jamaica.Haiti was not directly hit, but lashed with days of rain that flooded rivers.In one Haitian town, 25 people died, including 10 children. Nearly 12,000 homes were flooded, roads left impassible and communities lost access to drinking water. Both countries expect the number to climb as more bodies are recovered.Holness said more than 30 Jamaican communities likely remained cut off by damages to roads and bridges. He said response efforts were hampered by shortages in helicopters, social workers, doctors and engineers, and that this underlined the need to carefully plan ahead for future storms.Cuban authorities evacuated hundreds of thousands of people last week as Melissa landed near its second-largest city, Santiago. They reported no deaths, but extensive damage to homes, crops and infrastructure.Experts at US forecaster AccuWeather estimated damages across the Caribbean of $48bn to $52bn.Explore more on these topicsHurricane MelissaJamaicaAmericasExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

The administration has not provided evidence or more details.“We will find and terminate EVERY vessel with the intention of trafficking drugs to America to poison our citizens,” Hegseth said.Lawmakers from both parties have pressed the administration for more information on who is being targeted and the legal justification for the strikes.The latest attack comes as the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier has left the Mediterranean Sea on its way to the Caribbean after Hegseth ordered it to the region more than a week ago. It will join an already robust buildup of American planes, ships and thousands of troops in Latin America.A defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ship movements, confirmed that the Ford and the destroyer USS Bainbridge crossed through the Straits of Gibraltar and into the Atlantic on Tuesday.The Ford originally deployed with five destroyers, but it is not clear if all of them will go to the Caribbean. Two of the other destroyers in the Ford’s strike group, the USS Winston Churchill and the USS Mahan, are in the Mediterranean now, with the Mahan in port at Rota, Spain.The other two destroyers, the USS Forrest Sherman and the USS Mitchener, are in the Red Sea, the official said.In the latest strike, a video Hegseth posted to social media has a gray box obscuring a boat that appears in the water before it is blown up. The footage then cuts to the vessel engulfed by flames.Explore more on these topicsUS militaryVenezuelaAmericasTrump administrationPete HegsethUS foreign policyDrugs tradenewsShareReuse this content"

It doesn’t make sense | Bill HareRead moreGas has “significant potential” as an intermediate energy source as economies move from using coal and oil to renewable energy, according to the December 2024 report marked “Cabinet in Confidence” obtained by the Guardian and the ABC.However, gas exports to Asia could also slow investments in renewable energy.“These risks must be carefully managed to ensure natural gas serves as a true bridge fuel rather than a long-term dependency that hinders progress toward decarbonisation goals,” Deloitte concluded.Deloitte sees a diminishing role for gas in Australia’s traditional markets of Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. There, consumption must start declining in the 2030s and be just 20% of current levels by 2050 for global warming to be limited to 1.5C.Gas imports (measured in exajoules of energy) is expected to fall in established markets.Illustration: Deloitte report to WA governmentHowever, the global consultancy concluded that a growing use of gas for the next 15 years in China, India and Indonesia, followed by a substantial fall in the 2040s, is consistent with climate goals.Gas use is predicted to grow in China and India before reducing.Illustration: Deloitte report to WA governmentThomas Houlie, an analyst with research organisation Climate Analytics, who has reviewed the report, doubts that increased gas use – which requires billions of dollars for gas import terminals, pipelines and gas-fired power stations – would decline so quickly.“There is no way to politically guarantee that a fossil fuel like LNG will only be used in the short term, particularly given the lead time it takes to get it up and running,” he said.“Ultimately, it benefits an industry that can develop these projects and then apply political pressure to cement them in.”The Japanese government is financing gas production, transportation, and use projects across Asia in a “market-making role” to “enhance Japan’s trade influence and generate commercial opportunities for Japanese firms,” according to Deloitte.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said it outlined how WA gas was “playing an important role in Asia’s transition to net zero”.The premier said on a recent trip to Japan he promoted WA’s role in that country’s energy transition through the supply of LNG, ammonia made with gas and carbon capture and storage, and green fuels “when they become commercially available”.“With limited space to deliver onshore and offshore renewables, coupled with massive energy demand, Japan relies on its trusted trading partners to provide secure, affordable and lower carbon energy,” Cook said.Explore more on these topicsWestern AustraliaAsia PacificClimate crisisGasFossil fuelsEnergyParis climate agreementnewsShareReuse this content"

National and local authorities have been informed and must assist with additional measures at a national level.”Their investigations found that remote deactivation could be prevented by removing the buses’ sim cards, but they decided against this because it would also disconnect the bus from other systems.Ruter said it planned to bring in stricter security requirements for future procurements. Jenssen said it must act before the arrival of the next generation of buses, which could be even “more integrated and harder to secure”.Movia, Denmark’s largest public transport company, has 469 Chinese electric buses in operation – 262 of which were manufactured by Yutong.Jeppe Gaard, Movia’s chief operating officer, said he was last week made aware that “electric buses – like electric cars – can be remotely deactivated if their software systems have web access”. He added: “This is not a Chinese bus problem. It is a problem for all types of vehicles and devices with Chinese electronics built in.”Gaard said the Danish agency for civil protection and emergency management, Samsik, told it that it was not aware of any specific cases in which electric buses had been deactivated, but warned that the vehicles were equipped with “subsystems with internet connectivity and sensors (cameras, microphones, GPS) that can constitute vulnerabilities which could be exploited to disrupt bus operations”.Samsik confirmed that it had been contacted by Movia and said that it was “not aware of any specific cases of deactivation of electric buses”.A Samsik spokesperson added: “The authorities have previously advised the transport sector in relation to the purchase of Chinese electric buses and are ready to advise and guide companies and authorities on the prevention and handling of threats.“Samsik follows developments in the area and continuously assesses whether existing guidance and recommendations in the area are adequate. This includes determining the need for updated information or collaboration with other authorities to address security risks associated with certain technologies.”Yutong said it “strictly complies with the applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards of the locations where its vehicles operate” and that Yutong vehicle terminal data in the EU were stored at an Amazon Web Services (AWS) datacentre in Frankfurt.A spokesperson added: “This data is used solely for vehicle-related maintenance, optimisation and improvement to meet customers’ after-sales service needs. The data is protected by storage encryption and access control measures. No one is allowed to access or view this data without customer authorisation. Yutong strictly complies with the EU’s data protection laws and regulations.”Thomas Rohden, the chair of the Danish China-Critical Society and a regional Social Liberal party councillor, said Denmark has been “way too slow” when it came to dependence on Chinese companies.“This is a huge problem. We should not be so dependent on a country that has values and ideals so different to Denmark,” Rohden said. He added that at a time when Denmark was trying to increase its resilience amid allegations of hybrid attacks by Russia “it’s not very resilient to be totally dependent on China”.The Norwegian ministry of transport declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsDenmarkChinaAsia PacificEuropeNorwaynewsShareReuse this content"

The bears have been roaming near schools, train stations, supermarkets and even at a hot springs resort.Some of the encounters have resulted in injuries and even a number of deaths. The growing bear population’s encroachment into residential areas is happening in a region with a rapidly aging and declining human population.Since April, more than 100 people have been injured and at least 12 killed in bear attacks across Japan, according to the environment ministry.Bear attack survival tips released in Japan as encounters surgeRead moreThe defence ministry and Akita prefecture signed an agreement on Wednesday to deploy soldiers to address the problem. Soldiers will set box-traps with food, transport local hunters and help dispose of dead animals. Officials say the soldiers will not use firearms to cull the bears.Fumitoshi Sato, the deputy chief cabinet secretary, said: “Every day, bears intrude into residential areas in the region and their impact is expanding. Responses to the bear problem are an urgent matter.”The operation began in a forested mountain area in Kazuno city in northern Akita, where bear sightings and injuries have been reported. A team of white-helmeted soldiers wearing bulletproof vests and carrying bear spray and net launchers set up a trap near an orchard.Takahiro Ikeda, an orchard operator in the neighbourhood, said bears had already eaten more than 200 of his apples that were ready for harvest. “My heart is broken,” he told NHK television.Kenta Suzuki, the governor of Akita, said local authorities were getting “desperate” due to a lack of resources amid daily reports of bear sightings and attacks.Shinjiro Koizumi, the defence minister, said the aim of the bear mission was to help secure people’s daily lives, but that service members’ primary mission was national defence and unlimited support for the mission could not be provided. The Japanese self-defence forces are already understaffed.So far, the ministry has not received requests from other prefectures for troop assistance over the bear issue, he said.In Akita prefecture, which has a population of about 880,000, bears have attacked more than 50 people since May, killing at least four, according to the local government. Experts say most of the bear attacks have occurred in residential areas.Sharp rise in bear attacks in Japan as they struggle to find foodRead moreAn elderly woman who went mushroom-hunting in the forest was found dead in an apparent bear attack over the weekend in the city of Yuzawa. Another elderly woman in Akita city who encountered a bear while working on a farm was killed in late October. A newspaper delivery man was attacked and injured by a bear in Akita city on Tuesday.On Wednesday, a woman in Akita city spotted two bears on a persimmon tree in her garden. From indoors, she filmed the bears as they ate the fruits and walked around the garden for about 30 minutes. The woman, in her 70s, told a local TV network that she was frightened because the bears appeared at one point to want to enter the room she was in, and she moved away from the window.Experts say Japan’s aging and declining population in rural areas is among the reasons for the growing bear problem. They say the bears are not endangered and need culling to keep the population under control.Explore more on these topicsJapanWildlifeAsia PacificAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Their replacements, the crew of Shenzhou-21, had already arrived on the weekend.Don’t look up: how Trump’s deregulation drive could obscure the stars and threaten our access to spaceRead more“The Shenzhou-20 crewed spacecraft is suspected to have been struck by a small piece of orbital debris, and assessment of the impact and associated risks is currently under way,” said the China MannedSpaceAgency in a statement.“To ensure the health and safety of the astronauts and the successful completion of the mission, it has been decided that the originally planned return of Shenzhou-20 on November 5 will be postponed.”Authorities didn’t say when the incident is believed to have occurred. There was no indication of any issues earlier this week, with state media reporting on the two crews enjoying a meal of baked chicken cooked on the space station’s first ever oven, delivered by the Shenzhou-21 team. On Tuesday the two teams were reported to have conducted a handover ceremony, with videosposted to social media.A popular aerospace and science communicator, Yu Jun, who posts under the name Steed’s Scarf, said if the assessments determine it’s too high risk for the spacecraft to return, authorities would activate a “plan B”, potentially the deployment of a waiting backup ship on Earth.View image in fullscreenThe three astronauts from the Shenzhou-21 spaceship pose with the Shenzhou-20 crew aboard the space stationPhotograph: Xinhua/Shutterstock“Shenzhou-22 and the Long March 2F (launcher) were already on standby. This is our rolling backup mechanism. They are in ‘emergency duty’ mode and ready to bring our astronauts home safely if needed,” Yu told his more than five million followers on Weibo.China has steadily advanced its manned space program, conducting 37 flights and six manned flights, and aims to land a man on the moon by 2030.The returning Shenzhou-20 team’s commander, Chen Dong, already holds a Chinese record for the longest cumulative spaceflight, with more than 380 days in orbit, as well as the highest number ofspacewalks– six – by any Chinese astronaut.No Chinese astronauts have been to the International Space Station, a collaboration between the US, Russia, Canada, Europe and Japan, because of a US law that bars Nasa from cooperating with Chinese astronauts. China has instead said it expects to welcome international cooperation on Tiangong.Additional reporting by Jason Tzu Kuan Lu, Lillian Yang, and agenciesExplore more on these topicsChinaSpaceAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The ACCC said it was also concerned counterfeit products could contain unsafe levels of harmful chemicals, including lead.“Watch out for potential safety risks associated with counterfeit or fake Labubu dolls – often called Lafufus – and keep these products away from young children,” the ACCC said in a product safety release on Wednesday.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“Lafufu dolls may pose a safety risk to consumers, especially young children. Some Lafufus are small enough to fit entirely within the mouth of a young child, while other versions may have detachable body parts such as eyes, feet and hands, and poor stitching, which may be a choking hazard.”The ACCC provided a few brief tips to identify a real Labubu, made by the company Pop Mart, from a fake:Counterfeit items could have small detachable parts like eyes, feet or hands.Lafufu’s could have poor stitching or use cheap fabrics.Authentic Labubus have exactly nine teeth.

Girls reject these ideas. If you’re a heterosexual adolescent boy, that’s a pretty compelling pitch.“Girls are telling you they don’t want the alpha male … they want you to rock up as your authentic self and connect at a deeper level. Girls don’t want boys subscribing to these restrictive ideas.“The second reason for hope is there’s a large number of boys, girls, non-binary adolescents under pressure to adhere to these ideas but a much smaller number that endorse them.“And parents really matter. There’s a lot out there about the manosphere and online influencers, but adolescents are telling us their parents and their friends matter a great deal more – that’s both mums and dads.”The Ambox model is made of four pillars of belief about what it is to be “manly”: to be constantly tough; emotionally stoic; that one must be able to both taunt and be taunted; and “heterosexism” – that masculinity is in opposition to homosexuality and femininity and anything “girly” or “gay”.The study found those who hold stereotypical beliefs are more likely to get their ideas about masculinity online, and more than half said pornography has a big influence on “their ideas about how to be a boy in the world”. They were more likely to have seen sexually explicit deepfakes and to have watched porn with concerning and coercive content.“The pornography they’re watching is more likely to be violent and non-consensual: over 80% are watching pornography where girls or women are choked, kicked, punched, shoved, slapped, gagged, choked, or experiencing something that is non-consensual,” the study found.“The more strongly adolescent boys hold rigid views about masculinity, the more likely they are to cause harm to others.”But they are also the ones hurt by these factors. They are more likely to feel misunderstood, to feel lonely, to have poor mental health, and to feel that life is against them.And on the other end of the spectrum, those who least strongly endorse the “rules” are much more likely to have healthy attitudes to gender equality and to reject violence against women.The vast majority of boys – 96% – thought girls should be treated as equals, even if their specific beliefs did not reflect that.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here’s how to reach young men like me | Josh SargentRead moreTwo or three times as many boys as girls agreed with statements about the importance of being manly, of not talking about feelings, of not having a lot of gay friends, of suffering teasing even if it’s mean or degrading.Most girls recognised the pressure on boys to “act manly” but did not necessarily think they should. For example, 62% of girls acknowledged there was an expectation for boys to be manly but only between 8% and 15% agreed with the stereotypical “rules” of manliness, compared with 25% to 44% of boys.Overall, the report said, everyone has a role to play in challenging the “rules”. “It should not fall solely on boys to challenge these expectations,” it found, and recommended stronger prevention measures, early intervention for at-risk boys, more support for parents and carers to discuss sensitive topics with boys, and that the digital environment should be made safer.“The crux of this at a fundamentally human level is that anyone, but particularly adolescents, long for belonging, for connection and a sense of purpose,” Tyler said.“When [that sense] comes from these socially constructed ideas related to gender, your life’s probably not going to be that good. They’re tenuous ideas on which to hang your identity.”Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsGenderPornographyYoung peopleAustralian educationnewsShareReuse this content"

He was summoned aged 10 to Spain by Franco, who trained him to be his successor.“I respected him enormously, appreciated his intelligence and political sense,” Juan Carlos said of Franco. In the 500-page book, published in French on Wednesday and in Spanish next month, he recalls sitting beside Franco as the ailing dictator lay dying in his hospital bed.“He took my hand and said, as if it was his last breath: ‘Your highness, I ask you just one thing: keep the country united,’” Juan Carlos recalled.He was crowned king two days after Franco’s death in 1975.In the memoir he also writes about the death in 1956 of his 14-year-old brother, Alfonso, in Portugal as the pair cleaned a pistol – a case that has never been fully investigated. He writes that it’s the first time he has spoken of the traumatic episode.“I lost a friend, a confidant. He left a huge void,” he said. “Without his death, my life would have been less bleak, less unhappy.”Whatever credit he gained from opposing the coup was squandered over the years as news of his extramarital affairs and allegations of tax fraud emerged. He said he bitterly regretted his long-running affair with the Danish-German socialite Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn, saying it had harmed his reputation among his compatriots and led to his downfall and self-imposed exile in Abu Dhabi.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He faces charges of organised theft and criminal conspiracy.A court in Bobigny, north of Paris, on Wednesday postponed his trial in a separate case in which he is accused of damaging public property, saying the conditions for a “serene” hearing could not be met due to “media attention and recent events”.Louvre jewel heist by petty criminals, not organised professionals, says Paris prosecutorRead moreMaxime Cavaillé, one of the lawyers representing the suspect, said his defence would be “extremely vigilant” about “respect of the presumption of innocence” and aim to protect their client’s rights and privacy despite the extraordinary nature of the Louvre case.Four suspects are in custody in relation to the theft, including three thought to have been members of the four-man gang who used a stolen truck with an extendable ladder and freight lift to reach the first-floor window of the museum’s Apollo gallery.Two of the gang smashed an unsecured window and two glass display cases before descending in the lift and fleeing on motorbikes driven by the other two, in a brazen daylight heist that lasted less than seven minutes from start to finish.They fled with eight pieces, including an emerald and diamond necklace that Napoleon I gave to his second wife, Marie Louise, and a diadem set with 212 pearls and nearly 2,000 diamonds that once belonged to the wife of Napoleon III.French media have reported that Abdoulaye N – whose DNA was reportedly found on one of the display cases and on items abandoned at the scene, which included gloves, a hi-vis vest and disc cutters – is suspected of being one of the pair who broke into the gallery.Le Parisien newspaperandBFMTVsaid the suspect was known on social media as Doudou Cross Bitume, a well-known neighbourhood figure who had released numerous videos on YouTube and, more recently, TikTok and Instagram.Some videos, with the sloganToujours plus près du bitume(Always closer to the tarmac), show him performing tricks on motorbikes in Paris and Aubervilliers, near the Stade deFrancesports stadium. Others offer muscle-building tips.In several of the videos, Doudou Cross Bitume is shown riding a Yamaha TMax, the particularly powerful make of mega-scooter used in the Louvre thieves’ getaway. Investigators working on the case have not yet recovered the stolen jewels.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Neighbours told the paper he was “helpful”, “decent” and a man “who wears his heart on his sleeve”.According to several French media outlets, Abdoulaye N’s criminal record features 15 offences, including: possession and transportation of drugs; driving without a licence; and causing danger to others. He was also convicted of robbing a jewellery store in 2014.The Paris prosecutor, Laure Beccuau, has said the suspect had told police little but had “partially admitted” his involvement in the Louvre heist. Another suspect in the Louvre case arrested last week had been convicted in the same 2014 robbery, she said.Beccuau also said the suspects’ profiles “do not correspond with those one generally associates” with high-level, meticulously planned organised crime, prompting French media to speculate that they may have been hired by an unknown mastermind.The suspect had been initially scheduled to stand trial on Wednesday on minor charges of breaking a mirror and damaging the door of the prison cell where he was detained in 2019 as part of a separate theft investigation, which later cleared him, Associated Press reported.Explore more on these topicsParisFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Although the missile and the drone are both capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, neither of these were actual tests of nuclear bombs.A Russian nuclear test would mark an extraordinary rupture of a long-held pause in testing: the US last conducted a test in 1992, China and France in 1996, and the Soviet Union in 1990. Post-Soviet Russia, which inherited the USSR’s nuclear arsenal, has never done one.Much of Putin’s show of strength appears to stem from Russia’s recent advances in Ukraine.Russia has spent more than a year trying to seize Pokrovsk, an important frontline city and logistical hub seen as the gateway to Donetsk, and has suffered heavy losses in the process.Home to about 50,000 people before the war, the city lies on a crucial highway connecting a network of urban strongholds that make up Ukraine’s last major defensive line in the Donetsk region. Its fall would represent a breakthrough for Moscow, bringing Russian forces closer to their longstanding goal of seizing the entire region.In recent weeks, Russian forces have sharply intensified their attacks, initially relying on small dismounted assault groups before gradually massing enough troops to launch a broader offensive on the city.DeepState, a Ukrainian project that tracks the frontline using verified open-source imagery, showed on Tuesday that Russian forces had advanced further into Pokrovsk and its outskirts, though much of the area remained shaded grey – indicating it was still contested.In an evening update, the project added: “The situation remains critical.”Artem Karyakin, a well-known soldier in the Ukrainian armed forces, wrote on X that Russian troops were “present in every district of the city”.“There is no good news from there; the situation remains tense. While Russian forces have not yet fully taken control of the city, fighting is ongoing,” he added.Over the weekend, Ukraine deployed special forces to Pokrovsk in an effort to change the momentum and prevent a possible encirclement. Ukraine’s defence intelligence released footage of the Tymur special unit in action, showing a helicopter landing under fire, fierce street fighting, and drone strikes on Russian positions.However, the daring operation does not appear to have shifted the situation in Ukraine’s favour.Some Ukrainian and western commentators have questioned Kyiv’s decision to continue defending Pokrovsk, arguing that it exposes its soldiers to grave danger in what may already be a lost battle.View image in fullscreenZelenskyy (right) visits troops near Pokrovsk.Photograph: Ukraine Presidency/Planet Pix/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock“Ukraine may be repeating a costly mistake in Pokrovsk,” wrote Emil Kastehelmi, an analyst with the Finland-based Black Bird Group, which monitors the war, on X.“It’s a recurring pattern, seen for example in Vuhledar and Kursk – a reluctance to conduct a controlled, militarily justified withdrawal from a threatened salient when the situation no longer favours the defender,” he added, referring to areas Ukraine eventually abandoned after prolonged standoffs.Ukrainska Pravda, Ukraine’s leading independent outlet, has previouslycriticisedthe country’s military command for errors made in Pokrovsk and reported that some brigades have misled superiors about their frontline positions.Even without those concerns, the Ukrainian army is fighting an uphill battle, worn down by the same pressures that forced retreats in the past: acute shortages of men and the constant barrage of Russian drones cutting supply lines.Moscow has also recently gained a new battlefield advantage, deploying jet-powered glide bombs capable of striking targets far beyond the frontline – a significant upgrade to its arsenal, and one that has placed an even greater strain on Ukraine’s already stretched air defences.Kyiv will be hoping the eventual fall of Pokrovsk does not give Moscow a springboard for a renewed push towards Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, the two largest Ukrainian-held cities in the Donetsk region, which Russia has long sought to seize.While Russian forces continue to advance, their progress remains slow and costly, raising questions over whether they have the capacity to push on further.At the same time, Ukrainian forces are stretched out on other parts of the front.Russian troops have entered Kupiansk, a strategically important city in the northern Kharkiv region, which Moscow claims to have encircled. Ukraine has denied those claims, with Zelenskyy saying earlier this week that Ukrainian units were working to eliminate what he described as about 60 Russian soldiers in the city.The worsening situation in the east comes as diplomatic contacts between Russia and the US over the war in Ukraine appear to have ground to a halt.Speaking last week after a meeting with Xi Jinping in South Korea, Trump appeared to signal a more hands-off approach, saying: “Sometimes you have to let them fight.”Last month, his administration imposed tough sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil producers, measures that appear to have hit the country’s energy revenues.At the same time, however, the US president has continued to withhold longer-range weapons, including Tomahawk missiles, from Ukraine.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeNuclear weaponsnewsShareReuse this content"

Closing the care homes and day centres could save £4.16m, LCC said.LCC currently spends about £545m a year on adult social care.Last monthit began a consultationon moving residents out of five local authority care homes and into other premises, “enhancing resident experience, while delivering essential savings”.It said more older people in Lancashire should be cared for in their own homes. The consultation closes in mid-December and the cabinet will make a final decision on the closures in February.Margaret France, a Labour councillor in Chorley, said it looked like “selling off the family silver” and “opening the door to private providers”.One of the homes is Woodlands in Clayton-le-Moors in Accrington. The council says it would need to spend £1.39m to bring it up to scratch.Dorothy Devereux, 92, a former nurse, has lived in Woodlands for 12 years. She said she was devastated by the proposals and insisted she would not leave without a fight.“This is our home,” she said. “Where are we all going to go?” She said she doubted that housing her in the private sector would save the council any money, and said she could not “go home” to be cared for because she had sold her home to pay for her fees.She added: “I’m staying here till I’m either forcibly removed or in a box.”Phil Price, whose mother is in Grove House in Adlington, another of the homes earmarked for closure, said: “My mum is 93. If she finds out about this, it’ll kill her.”He said he was disgusted at what he fears is a conflict of interest involving Reform’s cabinet member for adult social care, Graham Dalton, who owns a private care company in Lancashire.“I’m a paid-up member of Reform and I’m disgusted with him,”said Price.He voted for Reform knowing they planned to cut “waste”. But he said: “If there are parents who have paid into the system all their lives, worked hard for this country, if they’re ‘waste’, then we might as well just give up.” He said he would quit Reform UK if the homes closed.When the care home closures were discussed at LCC’s health and adult social services scrutiny committee on Wednesday, Dalton, a nurse, insisted he was not conflicted.He told the committee he was a part owner of 1st for Care GB. The company, based in Lancaster, offers private care, including 24-hour complex care and respite care.But he said he had “no pecuniary or non-pecuniary interest” in the care home closures.He was challenged by councillors including Liz McInnes, a former Labour MP who now sits on Rossendale borough council.She said: “I’m fairly sure that on our council if someone was part-owner of a care service that would at least be counted as a non-pecuniary interest because they could potentially benefit from care homes closing.”On Wednesday evening the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, said on X: “If this is what happens when Reform runs a council, just imagine [Nigel] Farage running the country – care homes closed and vulnerable people abandoned. We cannot let Trump’s America become Farage’s Britain.”In August the Care Quality Commission rated Lancashire’s adult social services as “requires improvement”, finding long waiting times for services, staffing issues and “stark inequalities between the most and least deprived areas”.Explore more on these topicsReform UKLancashireSocial careEnglandLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

NGN also published theNews of the World, which was closed after the phone-hacking scandal.It has now emerged in court that Jefferies and NGN settled a claim at the high court in November 2024. News UK, the parent company of NGN, said the settlement was made on the basis of the invasion of Jefferies’ privacy by the News of the World.NGN agreed to pay damages, but the court was told it did so with “no admission of liability in relation to the claimant’s allegations of voicemail interception and/or other unlawful information gathering at the Sun”.Lurid stories about Jefferies and his life regularly appeared in the press after it emerged that Yeates, who disappeared in December 2010, had been his tenant. She was later found dead.Jefferies was initially arrested by police and held in custody for three days. However, he was found to have no connection to the crime. Vincent Tabak, a Dutch engineer who had lived in the UK since 2007, was eventually jailed for a minimum of 20 years after being found guilty of the murder.Jefferies claimed that NGN had published private information about his life throughout most of 2011. The court was told the articles relating to him “had a damaging and long-lasting effect on him and his private life, including his standing in the community and to his relationships with some friends”.Mariyam Kamil, a Matrix Chambers barrister for NGN, said: “The defendant is here today, through me, to offer its apologies to Mr Jefferies for the distress caused to him by the invasion of his privacy by individuals working for or on behalf of the News of the World.“The defendant acknowledges that such activity should never have taken place and that it had no right to intrude into Mr Jefferies’s private life in this way.”It marks the latest vindication for Jefferies. While police insisted they had been right to arrest him, theyapologised in 2013for not making it clear sooner that he was innocent.Jefferies was arrested and questioned for two days after the body of 25-year-old Yeates was found on Christmas Day in 2010. Tabak was charged with Yeates’s murder three weeks later, but Jefferies remained on police bail until March 2011.The chief constable of Avon and Somerset police, Nick Gargan, said arresting Jefferies had been an “integral step” in the inquiry, but accepted that once he had been released from bail, the force should have considered making it clear in public he was innocent.Speaking in 2012, Jefferies said he had been the victim of a “character assassination” by some of the media. He said he had been presented as a “dark, macabre, sinister villain … a lewd figure … a peeping Tom”.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Clean energy doesn’t just mean energy security, so Putin can’t put his boot on our throat: it means lower bills for working families in every part of the UK.”Starmer is expected to announce new investment in the low-carbon economy, aimed at boosting economic growth. While in Brazil, he will talk to other leaders and business groups about investment in the UK, where thegreen economy has been growing three times faster than other sectors.Despite his vocal support for climate action, Starmer’s reception at the leaders’ summit was likely to be frosty from the Brazilian hosts, as the prime minister has also decided not to contribute – at least for now – to Brazil’s flagship project for Cop30.The Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF) is hoped by Brazil’s president, Lula da Silva,to be the crowning achievement of the Cop30 conference. The aim is to raise $125bn (£96bn) – about $25bn from governments and public institutions, with the rest coming from private sector investors and financial markets – for projects in forested countries, including Brazil. It aims to preserve existing forests and reward governments and those who live in forested areas for protecting them for the long term, rather than exploiting them for short-term gains.The Guardian understands that the government regards the TFFF as being early-stage, and has not ruled out contributing when the fund has shown it can work in practice. Some academics and experts have voiced concerns to the Guardian over the structure of the fund, but there are hopes that any problems can be overcome.Starmer’s decision not to back the TFFF may also prove an embarrassment toPrince William, who is also in Brazilto present the Earthshot prize, for which the TFFF is nominated.Starmer had beenurged by some aides to skip the climate talksfor fear of presenting a target to the Reform party, which hasdenied climate scienceand wants to scrap the pledge of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.But the prime minister is understood to want to reinforce themessage he has given repeatedly in the past year, that pushing for a greener economy will bolster economic growth and improve people’s lives.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

That is national renewal.”Starmer can boast of the UK’s pledge to cut emissions, which is stronger than that ofmany countries which have failed to set out clear plansto move to a low-carbon economy.China has produced a plan that critics say is too weak, though the country has a history of exceeding its targets.The EU failed to agree on an emissions-cutting target until Tuesday night, after months of squabbling among member states and attempts by hard-right groupings in the EU parliament to derail the talks. The target agreed, a range of 66.25% to 72.5% cuts by 2035 compared with 1990 levels, as part of a bloc-wide effort to reach 90% cuts by 2040, was criticised by some green groups as too feeble.Explore more on these topicsCop30Green economyKeir StarmerTrees and forestsBrazilEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

Without a warrant, staff have no legal power to keep prisoners in custody.Inexperienced staff are being left with large caseloads of prisoners to process due to the high turnover of people coming through the prison system.In the 12 months to March this year, 262 prisoners were released in error, a 128% increase from 115 the previous year, according to government data. The vast majority (233) occurred in prisons, while the remaining 29 happened in courts.These mistakes largely passed without comment until it emerged last month that Hadush Kebatu, the former asylum seeker whose sexual offences and subsequent legal case triggered violent unrest in Essex this summer, had been accidentally released from HMP Chelmsford.On the day Kebatu was freed, a delivery driver said he saw him return to the prison in a “very confused” state four or five times, only to be turned away by staff and directed to the railway station.Chaos at HMP Wandsworth was laid bare in September 2023 when a prisoner escaped.The former soldier Daniel Khalife, later found guilty of spying for Iran, escaped from the south-west London jail by clinging to the underside of a food delivery truck. He was caught days later on a canal towpath by a plainclothes detective.The prison was put into special measures last year and was among 10 jails issued with an urgent notice to improve since November 2022.The chief inspector of prisons, Charlie Taylor, said HMP Wandsworth was “still reeling” from Khalife’s escape and that security remained a “serious concern”.It emerged in court that two guards checked the truck with a torch and mirror and allowed it to leave the prison, despite telling the driver someone was missing.In 2024, inspectors said the turmoil they found at the “severely overcrowded” HMP Wandsworth was the result of “sustained decline permitted to happen in plain view of leaders”. They warned that guards did not always know where prisoners on their wings were, despite an investment of almost £900,000 since the escape.David Lammy, the justice secretary, will want to know why the five-page set of checks that he introduced just over a week ago failed to stop the latest release errors.The instructions required more senior prison staff to sign off a release, with a duty governor made personally responsible for an inspection of release procedures.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Congress is granted sole authority under the constitution to levy taxes. The court hasuntilthe end of its term, in July 2026, to issue a ruling on the case.“We don’t contend that what’s being exercised here is the power to tax,” argued Dean John Sauer, US solicitor general, defending the Trump administration in the case. “It’s the power to regulate foreign commerce. These are regulatory tariffs.”“I just don’t understand this argument,” said the liberal justice Sonia Sotomayor. “You want to say tariffs are not taxes, but that’s exactly what they are.”“I guess I’m wondering whether you also don’t have to contend with the actual purpose of IEEPA,” added the liberal justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. The law is “designed and intended to limit presidential authority”, she suggested. “It’s pretty clear that Congress was trying to constrain the emergency powers of the president and IEEPA.“I appreciate that, generally, you can look at these words and you can imagine that they mean certain things,” said Jackson. “But here we have evidence that Congress was actually trying to do a particular thing, with respect to the authority that it was presenting to the president. And that thing was not raising revenue.The conservative justice Brett Kavanaugh told the solicitor general “one problem you have is that presidents since IEEPA have not done this.”Neal Katyal, the attorney arguing for private companies in the case, said: “Tariffs are taxes. They take dollars from Americans pockets and deposit them in the US Treasury, our founders gave that taxing power to Congress alone.”He continued, “yet here, the president bypassed Congress and imposed one of the largest tax increases in our lifetimes. Many doctrines explain why this is illegal, like the presumption that Congress speaks clearly when it imposes taxes and duties and the major questions doctrine, but it comes down to common sense. It’s simply implausible that in enacting IEEPA, Congress handed the president the power to overhaul the entire tariff system and the American economy in the process, allowing him to set and reset tariffs on any and every product from any and every country at any and all times.”Katyal argued against the use of emergencies for a president to implement tariffs.“I would say the best way of understanding what Congress does in emergencies is to look at their emergency statutes. Not one has ever given the president a taxation power or a tariff power,” he explained. “This is not a wartime or conquered territory statute. This is a use of the statute. They are tariffing the entire world in peacetime. And they are doing it asserting a power that no president in our history has ever had.”The Oregon solicitor general, Benjamin Gutman, who argued on behalf of states suing the Trump administration over the tariffs, said “the federal government hasn’t identified a single other federal statute that uses the term ‘regulate’ to authorize tariffs or taxes”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The supreme court haslargely sidedwith the administration through itsshadow docketto overrule lower courts.Should the supreme court ultimately rule against Trump’s use of the IEEPA to impose tariffs, it will force the White House to go back to the drawing board and reconsider how to enforce an aggressive economic policy which has strained global trade ties.Should the court side with the administration, however, it will embolden a president who has repeatedly claimed – despite warnings over the risk of higher prices – that tariffs will help make America great again, raising “trillions” of dollars for the federal government and revitalizing its industrial heartlands.Trump himself has argued the court’s decision is immensely important. The case is “one of the most important in the History of the Country”, he wrote on social media over the weekend, claiming that ruling against him would leave the US “defenseless”.“If we win, we will be the Richest, Most Secure Country anywhere in the World, BY FAR,” Trump claimed. “If we lose, our Country could be reduced to almost Third World status – Pray to God that that doesn’t happen!”But some of his senior officials have suggested that, if the court rules against their current strategy, they will find another way to impose tariffs. The treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, who plans to attend the oral arguments in the case, hassaidthe administration has “lots of other authorities” to do so.After Wednesday’s hearing Bessent said he felt “very, very optimistic.”Asked how the administration would return the large amounts of funds already collected if the supreme court upheld the ruling, Bessent said: “We’ll cross that bridge if we come to it, but I’m confident we won’t have to.”According to the non-partisanTax Foundation, Trump’s tariffs amount to an average tax increase per US household of $1,200 in 2025 and $1,600 in 2026.A coalition of 12 states – Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Vermont – and small businesses havesuedthe Trump administration to block the tariffs.Several other small businesses alsofiledsuit against the Trump administration to block the tariffs.

So, the network recently launched a new streaming product of its own calledCNNAll Access – priced at $6.99 a month – that offers online access to a full menu of the network’s news and non-news content, along with a stream of CNN’s television product, something a previous incarnation lacked.On Tuesday, CNN All Access subscribers got exclusive access to an election night broadcast – the CNN Election Livecast – that the network’s data guy and host Harry Enten likened to a “watch party”. Previewing the event on CNN’s main channel, Enten said it would be “kind of like hanging out with your best friends who know the most about politics”.There’s no question that CNN’s cast on Tuesday night featured political experts, including commentators Ben Shapiro (the Daily Wire), Charlamagne tha God (the Breakfast Club), Ana Kasparian (the Young Turks) and the gen-Z conservative activist Isabel Brown, who also hosts a show for the Daily Wire. But the program often felt far from what was actually happening at the polls.Throughout the two-hour program, there were few updates on the results of the election. Those watching the streaming show rather than the main CNN broadcast, which featured the network’s standard election-night fare – anchors Jake Tapper and John King pointing to maps and getting live reports from campaign celebrations – were late to find out that the network had projected Zohran Mamdani as the winner of the New York City mayoral election. (Enten had to interrupt a discussion between Shapiro and Kasparian about the white nationalist Nick Fuentes to actually share the update.)CNN designed a set for the event that featured comfy couches, arcade games, a pop-a-shot basketball game and a foosball table. The idea was that the cast would actually have some fun, playing games while chatting politics and taking in the results. But everyone stayed glued to their seats – until the very end of the broadcast, when Enten made Shapiro play the basketball game. Neither had much success. “We have this lovely room here, and we haven’t actually utilized it at all,” Enten said. A large coffee table in the center of the room featured bowls of snacks that never seemed to get touched.Kara Swisher, who was beamed into the room for a few minutes, perhaps too honestly, described it as “the weirdest living room I’ve ever seen”.The panel also seemed to lack true ideological diversity, with the cast seeming to largely agree that Mamdani would struggle to actually govern – and all affirming that they viewed Joe Biden’s administration as a failure.About an hour in, Charlamagne tha God left the panel because, Enten said, he needed to get up early the next morning for his day job. He was replaced by Tezlyn Figaro, who has appeared on the Breakfast Club.As the event wound down, Enten struggled to actually end it because the panel was in the middle of a heated discussion about whether Mamdani was a “jihadist”.“That, I think, is a lovely way to end this evening,” Enten said, finding a stopping point. “I think it’s been an amazingly fun time – a different experience.”At that, in a nod to what matters most at CNN right now, Enten said he was off to spend a few hours analyzing election results on the television channel.Explore more on these topicsCNNUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

The ball is in Starbucks’ court.”The Starbucks Workers United union, had been in talks with the company since last year, andsaidin October it will vote on picketing in about 60 cities, demanding a contract that reflects “improved staffing, better pay and on-the-job protections”.Both sides blame the other for ending talks late last year and say they are ready to return to discussions.Starbucks said in a statement that “any agreement needs to reflect the reality that Starbucks already offers the best job in retail”.“Our fight is about actually making Starbucks jobs the best jobs in retail. Right now, it’s only the best job in retail for Brian Niccol [Starbucks’ CEO],” said Jasmine Leli, a three-year Starbucks barista and strike captain from Buffalo, New York. “Things have only gone backwards at Starbucks under Niccol’s leadership, but a fair union contract and the resolution of hundreds of unfair labor practice charges are essential to the company’s turnaround.”Explore more on these topicsStarbucksUS unionsCoffeeFood & drink industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, there were one-day falls for all of the“magnificent seven” AI-related stocks, including the chipmaker Nvidia, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Alphabet (the owner of Google) and Meta (the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp).The S&P also closed down just over 1% as it lost ground because of tech stocks, particularly the data analytics companyPalantir, which slumped by almost 8% despite having raised its revenue outlook the previous day.Palantir has also been targeted by a well-known short-seller – who bets on falls in the value of a company.The investor Michael Burry – who rose to prominence after predicting the 2008 financial crash andinspiring the film The Big Short– bet against Palantir and the chipmaker Nvidia, two of the biggest AI companies, sparking criticism from Palantir’s boss and a stock sell-off.In aninterview on CNBC, Alex Karp, Palantir’s chief executive, criticised Burry and other short-sellers for “trying to call the AI revolution into question”.Asian markets followed the US falls on Wednesday,recording the sharpest slidein seven months, as the concerns about tech stocks spread, and indices in Japan and South Korea dropped more than 5% from the record highs reached the previous day. In Europe, markets in the UK, France and Germany dropped slightly on Wednesday morning.The market falls came as the chief executives of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs cautioned there could be a market correction ahead.They added their voices to that of Jamie Dimon, the head of the US’s largest bank, JP Morgan Chase, whowarned in Octoberhe was worried markets would crash in the next six months to two years.Jim Reid, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said there was a “growing chorusdiscussing whether we might be on the verge of an equity correction”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A source close to the matter told Agence France-Presse this announcement was unrelated to the government action against the online platform.The discovery of sex dolls resembling children on Shein’s website triggered a political outcry in France.The Paris prosecutor’s office has opened investigations against Shein, as well as the rival online retailers AliExpress, Temu and Wish, over the sale of the sex dolls.Shein, which was founded in China in 2012 but is now based in Singapore, has pledged to cooperate with French authorities and announced it was banning all sex dolls on its platform.View image in fullscreenKarl-Stéphane Cottendin, the chief executive of BHV, at the opening of Shein in Paris.Photograph: Sadak Souici/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockHours before the doors of the new Paris store opened on Wednesday, shoppers began queueing outside the department store BHV, opposite the city hall, galvanised by the prospect of cheap clothes, usually made thousands of miles away. They were undeterred by protesters, politicians and riot police.“I have €200 a month to spend on clothes.

The regulator recommended that Facebook and its parent company,Meta, took measures to ensure adverts were non-discriminatory, giving the company three months to inform the French body of the measures.In its ruling, which is not legally binding, the regulator said the “system implemented for disseminating job offers treats users of the Facebook platform differently based on their sex and constitutes indirect discrimination related to sex”.The watchdog’s decision came after Global Witness, a campaign group whose remit includes investigating big tech’s impact on human rights, posted adverts on Facebook containing links to a range of jobs in countries includingFrance, the UK, Ireland and South Africa.The study found that in France specifically nine out of 10 people shown an advert for mechanic vacancies were male, while the same proportion of recipients of ads for preschool teachers were female. Eight out of 10 people who saw ads for psychologist positions were women, while seven out of 10 ads for pilots were viewed by men.Global Witness, together with French women’s rights organisations the Foundation for Women (La Fondation des Femmes) and Women Engineers (Femmes Ingénieurs), which had complained to the rights body, welcomed the ruling.“This appears to be the first time a European regulator has decided that a social media platform’s algorithm discriminates by gender, presenting a major step forward in holding these platforms accountable to existing law,” they said in a joint statement.Josephine Shefet, a lawyer representing the complainants, said: “The decision sends a strong message to all digital platforms: They will be held accountable for such bias. The legal principle establishes an important precedent for future cases.”Meta rejected the ruling. “We disagree with this decision and are assessing our options,” a spokesperson said.In 2022, Meta agreed tochange Facebook’s algorithmsafter the US Department of Justice alleged the platform’s housing advertising system discriminated against users based on characteristics including race, religion and sex.Explore more on these topicsFranceFacebookMetaAdvertisingEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Their replacements, the crew of Shenzhou-21, had already arrived on the weekend.Don’t look up: how Trump’s deregulation drive could obscure the stars and threaten our access to spaceRead more“The Shenzhou-20 crewed spacecraft is suspected to have been struck by a small piece of orbital debris, and assessment of the impact and associated risks is currently under way,” said the China MannedSpaceAgency in a statement.“To ensure the health and safety of the astronauts and the successful completion of the mission, it has been decided that the originally planned return of Shenzhou-20 on November 5 will be postponed.”Authorities didn’t say when the incident is believed to have occurred. There was no indication of any issues earlier this week, with state media reporting on the two crews enjoying a meal of baked chicken cooked on the space station’s first ever oven, delivered by the Shenzhou-21 team. On Tuesday the two teams were reported to have conducted a handover ceremony, with videosposted to social media.A popular aerospace and science communicator, Yu Jun, who posts under the name Steed’s Scarf, said if the assessments determine it’s too high risk for the spacecraft to return, authorities would activate a “plan B”, potentially the deployment of a waiting backup ship on Earth.View image in fullscreenThe three astronauts from the Shenzhou-21 spaceship pose with the Shenzhou-20 crew aboard the space stationPhotograph: Xinhua/Shutterstock“Shenzhou-22 and the Long March 2F (launcher) were already on standby. This is our rolling backup mechanism. They are in ‘emergency duty’ mode and ready to bring our astronauts home safely if needed,” Yu told his more than five million followers on Weibo.China has steadily advanced its manned space program, conducting 37 flights and six manned flights, and aims to land a man on the moon by 2030.The returning Shenzhou-20 team’s commander, Chen Dong, already holds a Chinese record for the longest cumulative spaceflight, with more than 380 days in orbit, as well as the highest number ofspacewalks– six – by any Chinese astronaut.No Chinese astronauts have been to the International Space Station, a collaboration between the US, Russia, Canada, Europe and Japan, because of a US law that bars Nasa from cooperating with Chinese astronauts.

This was reiterated by his two-goal show that helped to sweep Pep Guardiola’s improving team to 10 points from four games at the league stage’s halfway juncture.Factor in Erling Haaland, who decorated his captaincy for the night with a 27th goal (for club and country), and Waldemar Anton’s 72nd-minute jab home was solely an irritation.Pep Guardiola urges Manchester City’s Phil Foden to push for England recallRead moreBut after the strikeBorussia Dortmundhad more moments – Karim Adeyemi missed at point-blank range – and so despite Rayan Cherki’s fourth in added time, Guardiola is sure to remind his players to disallow the opponent from wresting the initiative as the visitors did for the closing phases.The bottom line, though, is that City are close to the cohesive proposition that makes them formidable. The ceiling is again high for the 2022‑23 treble winners – just where Guardiola would want the side before Liverpool’s visit on Sunday.Guardiola trained the squad on Wednesday morning, preferring to give players Tuesday off after their “so demanding”3-1 win against Bournemouthhere on Sunday. This rare move – “I’ve done it a few times” – caused the eye to look for any discernible impact on their rhythm seven or so hours after being put through the drills.By half-time, the answer was a definite no. Dortmund initially monopolised the ball, pinned their hosts back and a loose Josko Gvardiol pass allowed Adeyemi to be played through along the right and momentarily threaten Gianluigi Donnarumma’s goal. Adeyemi was soon breaking again along the same flank and zipping in a ball from which Maximilian Beier failed to prosper.Before this, a City foray had Foden crossing, the Dortmund goalkeeper Gregor Kobel repelling, and a throw-in being claimed. In this same sequence, Savinho fed Foden who powered a shot that Kobel parried downwards, then the in-rushing Brazilian blazed high.As against Bournemouth on Sunday, City were in breakaway rather than percussive passing mode. Savinho zipped over from his wing and caused Daniel Svensson to scythe him down but Foden’s free-kick pitter-pattered into Kobel’s gloves.This proved a sighter for City’s playmaker, and on receiving his next opportunity he scored – a goal that derived from classic Guardiola passing play. Camped in Dortmund territory, Nico González located Tijjani Reijnders in an inside-right zone. He pinged the ball to Foden and with a swish of his left foot Kobel was beaten with a calmly rolled finish.View image in fullscreenPhil Foden fires Manchester City ahead.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/ReutersIt was a “floodgates open” moment because City soon added a second. Savinho’s run and shot was palmed away by the overworked Kobel before Jérémy Doku collected on the left and skimmed the ball back in, along the turf, and Haaland smashed home.Pan left then, to a Guardiola whose joy was soon replaced by irritation caused by the latest detail of imperfection from his unit. It was a mystery really, because Kobel was soon tested again by a Reijnders hit, then Haaland marauded and offered up a rare treat: the sight of him turned winger, floating over a delivery from which Nico O’Reilly missed hitting home City’s third.Perhaps Guardiola’s ire was vented to prevent slackening off: if so he was horrified to witness his defence slumber with Adeyemi lurking under a high ball that Donnarumma chose to punch out rather than catch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In four previous meetings with City (all Champions League), Dortmund had won only once – 1-0 in a December 2012 group game – and when the second half began they were far away from a repeat.Savinho nearly killed all hope with a snap-shot Kobel again had to repel. Then Gvardiol dropped the ball into Dortmund’s danger area and they cleared their ranks.This time last year City struggled for consistency and solidity: keywords in the Guardiola manifesto. Here, as against Bournemouth and on more matchdays than not during this season, each were present.When González and O’Reilly played keep-ball at halfway, Niko Kovac’s side were a quasi-circular yellow wall. Seconds later, City, in their hypnotic fashion, had Savinho running by Dortmund’s six-yard box and forcing a corner: a diagram of how Guardiola’s side have dismantled so many foes.View image in fullscreenErling Haaland smashes the ball home for Manchester City’s second goal.Photograph: Nick Potts/PASo, too, was Foden’s second goal. Doku tapped to González who tapped to Reijnders. The pass went to the Stockport Iniesta who swivelled and again beat Kobel from long range: sheer class.City were in playful mood. A Doku pass was backheeled to Haaland who returned the ball and, when it came curving over, Savinho might have volleyed the sweetest of finishes but blasted over.Beforehand, Guardiola delivered an update on Rodri: “It [his hamstring issue] doesn’t feel perfect – he will not be out for a while.” When the No 16 does return, City will be even better.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueManchester CityBorussia DortmundEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Jets didn’t just tweak their roster at the deadline; they detonated it. In a dizzying few hours, they dealt cornerback Sauce Gardner to the Colts and defensive lineman Quinnen Williams to the Cowboys.Moving two All-Pros at the deadline is unprecedented. No team has ever so clearly embracedtankingat the deadline. The Jets, for once, looked in the mirror and were honest. They decided they were not good enough, and shipped out as many stars as they could for a mountain of future draft picks. They are now loaded with picks in 2026and2027, the latter of which has a much stronger draft class.You can’t fault the logic. Even with Gardner blanketing half the field and Williams crushing pockets, the Jets were 1–7 this season. The defense wasn’t the main problem, but it’s fallen off a cliff under Aaron Glenn’s leadership. So they tore it down. Gardner and Williams net three future first-rounders and a second-rounder over the next two seasons, giving the Jets five first-round picks in 2026 and 2027 combined. It’s a war chest that could recalibrate the entire organization around the offense. They already have a talented, young offensive line, and they kept Garrett Wilson, a blue-chip wide receiver. With that kind of draft ammunition over multiple draft classes, they can identify whoever they believe is the next elite quarterback prospect and build out a stable group around them.The Chiefs-Bills rivalry is incapable of producing a bad gameRead moreIt’s easy to scoff at teams giving up All-Pro talent for draft picks, particularly a 25-year-old like Gardner.Draft picks are great! Who knows, you could even select a player as talented as Sauce Gardner!But it’s different for the Jets. They’re not operating on a playoff or championship timeline. They tried a quick-fix with Aaron Rodgers at quarterback,and it didn’t work. Now, they’re finally taking a long-term view. If that puts them two years away from playoff contention, then picking up three first-round picks for a volatile cornerback and a defensive lineman who will be 29 by 2027 is wise. The question, of course, is whether “wise” and “Jets” can coexist when Woody Johnson, whomakes a strong casefor the worst owner in US sports, is still in charge. The moves should at least confirm that Johnson will stick with head coach Glenn, who will now be able to mould the roster in his own image.Teams don’t typically throw seasons away, and the Jets haven’t made the playoffs since the 2010 season, the longest drought in the NFL. The record of tanking in the NFL is poor. This isn’t the NBA, where one player can transform the trajectory of a franchise, and the No 1 overall pick is the most valuable commodity in the sport. There are too many moving pieces in football for one player to be an NBA-like difference-maker. The Browns, Dolphins and Texans have all tried some variation of multi-year tanking, and all three have failed to different degrees (Houston being the most successful). Still, the Jets deserve credit for extracting maximum value out of two players while resetting their own timeline. They may lack a pair of playmakers for the final eight games of this season, but they’re set up to build a strong foundation over the next two seasons. If anything, they should have pushed further and traded Jermaine Johnson and Breece Hall before the deadline closed.Sorry, Breece.The Colts go all-inOn the flip side of one of the Jets’ mega-deals are the Colts. Indy gave up two first-round picks and absorbed Gardner’s $30m per-year deal to fix their one glaring hole: cornerback. After trying to patchwork the group together, GM Chris Ballard decided to go all-in, chasing the biggest name available at the deadline. At 25 years old, Gardner is the youngest ever multiple All-Pro to be traded midseason. Players of his caliber rarely, if ever, become available during their prime.The Colts paid a higher price because they believe they acquired a player who could help them win a Super Bowl this year, just as the Rams did in the past with Von Miller and Jalen Ramsey.But there are reasons why Gardner wasavailable in the first place, despite signing a contract extension with the Jets in the offseason. He’s taken a step back since his otherworldly rookie season. Cornerback is a notoriously volatile position, but even by those standards, Gardner’s last couple of seasons have been worrying. In press coverage, where he can plaster himself to a receiver one-on-one, he remains one of the best in the game. Everything else has been a mystery. Gardner has shown little interest in tackling in a league that is increasingly built around the run game. He has also been responsible for plenty of coverage breakdowns while the splash plays have dried up (he has one interception in the last two and a half seasons).The Colts are betting that in a stronger environment, the Gardner of his rookie season will return. That player can lock down one-half of the field and help raise their entire defense, even if he doesn’t offer top-tier playmaking on his own. Maybe they’re right. But betting two first-round picks on anideaof who a player could be rather than who he has shown to be over 18 months is one heck of a gamble.Trading two first-rounders also confirms that the Colts believe Daniel Jones is the long-term answer, too. Without the means to draft a quarterback in the first round, they’ll likely sign Jones to a long-term extension, somewhere in the vicinity of three years for $120m. Jones has been lights out over the first half of the season, but that’s a small sample size to bank the future of the franchise on.It may work out. But it feels like a classic move from a GM under pressure. Ballard has built good, not great, teams for half a decade. He is working with new owners this year. Gardner could be the piece that turns good into great, or the overreach that ends Ballard’s tenure.Trades often work. It’s another path to upgrading a roster. Too many teams fetishize draft picks, the Colts chief among them. Trading one first-rounder is all-in; it’s effectively getting a player now that you’d have drafted next spring. And when that player is a 25-year-old All-Pro, it’s a no-brainer. But moving two first-round picks when you don’t have a settled quarterback is a reach. And doing so when you have a GM fighting for his future based on a hot start against an easy-ish schedule is a questionable process.Jerry keeps his wordJerry Jones promised a deadline day splash. He delivered. The Cowboys traded real assets – a first- and second-round pick over the next two drafts – to get Williams, a high-level interior disruptor. Adding Williams gives the Cowboys one of the most gifted interior defensive lines in the league. It’s a desperate attempt to fix their historically lousy run defense. Add linebacker Logan Wilson, who was acquired from Cincinnati for a seventh-round pick, and Dallas suddenly have upgrades at two key positions. Wilson looked cooked with the Bengals, but he at least knows where to be, and that’s a luxury Dallas hasn’t had at linebacker this season.From dynasty to soap opera: how Jerry Jones traded Dallas Cowboys glory for ‘365 days of sizzle’Read moreOn paper, it’s coherent. In practice, it’s expensive. They have already invested the majority of the return they received for trading away Micah Parsons. With all the moves in the books, they essentially dealt Parsons to:Acquire WilliamsAcquire defensive tackle Kenny Clark from the PackersMove up from the second to the first round in the 2026 draft, roughly 20 spotsSave $70m in salary cap spaceIs that a deal you would make? Parsons is a unique, dominant force at a premium position, still in his prime. Williams is excellent, but not on Parsons’ level. Clark may not even be on the roster next season. The Cowboys can gain an additional $20m in cap room if they release him this offseason.The Cowboys’ defense may be better this season, sure. But this is less about long-term planning than the emotional volatility of Jones. It still feels like Jones – and by default the Cowboys – are making it up as they go along. Each move makes sense on its own. But step back and bundle them together, and Dallas traded away one of the best players in the league for an excellent player nearing the end of his prime and some cap flexibility.The defending champs load upYes,Howie Roseman did it again. It’s become a ritual for the Eagles GM to move cheap, future draft picks to load up on talent for a potential title run. This year, he shopped in the luxury aisle, acquiring edge-rusher Jaelan Phillips from the Dolphins for a third-round pick.View image in fullscreenHas Howie Roseman built another championship winning team?Photograph: David J Phillip/APPhillips was always a logical target for the Eagles. They need more edge-rushing juice, with Nolan Smith dealing with an injury and Za’Darius Smith abruptly retiring. They were able to lure Brandon Graham out of retirement, but even with his return, they still lack serious sizzle off the edge. Phillips will give them some needed oomph. The move reunites Phillips with his former defensive coordinator, Vic Fangio, who extracted the most out of Phillips during their season working together before the player tore his achilles.Phillips is one of the most technically astute edge-defenders in the league. But he’s lost a step after atorrent of injuries, including an ACL injury last year. There have been flashes of the old player in Miami this season. His pressure rate has rebounded to his career high, but he lacks the explosiveness he once had to finish plays. He’s also winced when taking on blockers in the run game.In Philly, that shouldn’t matter as much. He will be a pass-rush specialist who should thrive on a pitch count.A third-rounder may have been an overpay for a player with such an extensive injury record who is a six-month rental. But the Eagles are operating on a different timeline. They have a chance to win back-to-back Super Bowls and had a spare third-round pick to play with. Among the edge-rushers on the market, Phillips was the best available for a reasonable price. If he makes a handful of plays in the playoffs, overpaying will be irrelevant. Phillips is only 26, and the Eagles could also extend him in the offseason.Phillips was not the only upgrade Roseman made before the deadline. The Eagles also added cornerbacks Michael Carter II and Jaire Alexander for a pair of late-round picks. Alexander, a two-time All-Pro, is a shadow of his former self, but Carter could prove to be a valuable pick-up down the stretch. He offers inside-outside flexibility and will allow Fangio to move Cooper DeJean around the defense based on the matchup. Snagging Phillips and Carter should help plug leaky parts of the defense – and Alexander is a worthwhile, low-risk flier.Seattle lands deal of the dayThe Cowboys and Colts may have made more seismic deals, but none could prove to be as impactful as the Seahawks’ picking up Rashid Shaheed. Seattle landed the receiver from the Saints for a fourth- and fifth-round pick.Shaheed is one of the league’s most dynamic deep threats, averaging over 17 yards a catch during his career. The Seahawks already lead the league in every deep passing metric, but Shaheed adds another jolt of electricity. The threat of Shaheed rolling deep will help the Seahawks complete their offensive jigsaw, opening up the intermediate part of the field and aiding a faltering run game. If defenses are fearful of deep bombs, they’ll back and give more space for the run game to hum underneath.The Seahawks have a Super Bowl-caliber roster. Their defense is the most flexible in the league, and is packed with playmakers at every level. Sam Darnold is playing at an MVP level. With another deep threat, Darnold and the passing game can maintain their explosiveness while improving their down-to-down consistency.The NFC is so deep that it’s tough to pick a favorite. Seattle are still scrapping to win the NFC West. But with Shaheed on board, the Seahawks roster is rounding into being the most complete in the conference.Explore more on these topicsNFLNew York JetsDallas CowboysIndianapolis ColtsPhiladelphia EaglesSeattle SeahawksUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The inaugural award will be presented on 5 December during the World Cup draw at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington DC, a high-profile event that Trump is expected to attend.Could Trump really move World Cup games? The facts behind his threatsRead moreIn astatement releasedahead of his joint appearance with Trump at the America Business Forum in Miami on Wednesday, Infantino said the prize would further the sport’s moral responsibility to unite people.“In an increasingly unsettled and divided world, it’s fundamental to recognise the outstanding contribution of those who work hard to end conflicts and bring people together in a spirit of peace,” Infantino said. “Football stands for peace, and on behalf of the entire global football community, this prize will recognise the enormous efforts of those individuals who unite people, bringing hope for future generations.”The timing has drawn attention given Trump’s ongoing preoccupation with theNobel peace prize, which he has aggressively campaigned for and carped about throughout his presidency.After this year’s award went to Venezuelan opposition leaderMaría Corina Machado, a phalanx of senior White House aidesdenounced the decisionas “politics over peace”. Days later, speaking from Capitol Hill amid a government shutdown, the Republican House speaker Mike Johnsonsaid he would partner with Amir Ohana, the speaker of Israel’s Knesset, to rally parliamentary leaders worldwide tojointly nominate Trumpfor next year’s prize. “No one has ever deserved that prize more,” Johnson said.Infantino’s announcement follows a month of peace-themed stagecraft featuring both men. The Fifa chief joined Trump at a 13 October summit in Egypt shortly after a ceasefire came into effect in Gaza, then told investors in Riyadh on 28 October that football should “invest in happiness” and promote unity. Fifa recently added another link to Trump by appointing his daughter Ivanka to the board of a $100m education project part-funded by 2026World Cupticket sales.The “Fifa Peace Prize – Football Unites the World”, as it will formally be known, will be presented annually “on behalf of all football-loving people” from around the globe. Infantino has framed the initiative as part of his wider campaign to position football as a global force for dialogue, arguing that while “the sport cannot solve conflict”, it can “carry a message of peace”.Still, the optics of the Miami announcement have fueled questions about the blurring of sport and diplomacy. Fifa’sclose alignment with Trump’s administration, which has been instrumental in staging the 2026 World Cup across the United States, Canada and Mexico, continues to test Infantino’s insistence that football exists beyond politics.Trump had announced in August that the World Cup draw would take place in Washington, with Infantino declaring: “We are uniting the world, Mr President, uniting the world, here in America.”The 2026 World Cup will run from 11 June to 19 July, featuring a record 104 matches across 16 cities.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026FifaDonald TrumpGianni InfantinoNobel peace prizeFootball politicsWorld CupShareReuse this content"

It galvanised us and it really put our arms around each other.”While the USA captain, Keegan Bradley,declined to condemnthe “passionate” New York fans, McIlroy said the experience ultimately strengthened the European team’s resolve en route to their narrow victory.Preparing now for the season-ending DP World Tour Championship in Dubai, the five-time major winner reflected on what he called a career‑defining campaign. “I think back to the start in January of 2025 when I was last here and everything that’s happened since,” McIlroy said. “Honestly, in my wildest dreams, I didn’t know. I mean, I knew a year like this was possible, but it has just been an amazing 10 months.”McIlroy also weighed in on LIV Golf’sdecision to expand to 72-hole eventsbeginning in 2026, a change widely seen as a bid for official world ranking points. “I think it’s a peculiar move because I think they could have got ranking points with three rounds. I don’t think three rounds versus four rounds is what was holding them back.“It certainly puts them more in line with traditional golf tournaments … but if that’s what they felt they needed to do to get the ranking points, I guess that’s what they had to do.”Yet McIlroy doubts the switch will significantly boost LIV players’ standings. “Say potentially they get world rankings points, but because their strength of fields are going to be so weak because a lot of the guys have fallen already in the rankings … I don’t know if the ranking points are really going to benefit them. It will be interesting to see how it plays out.”Explore more on these topicsRory McIlroyRyder Cup 2025Ryder CupPGA TourLIV Golf SeriesGolfnewsShareReuse this content"

I’m going to kill this guy.’ So we said OK. The fight plays out – and first-round finish by rear-naked choke.

A figure at the front of the pack in the shorter cross country and short track distances, Courtney would surprise everyone by winning the 77-mile race, claiming the second rainbow jersey of her nearly decade-long career.“The competition at the sharp end is so high and the course was brutal, so I was productively intimidated,” said the 30-year-old Courtney, “I didn’t think much about the pressure of winning, which let me just focus on myself.”Despite a final climb that took an agonizing hour, a 20-minute hiking section over a boulder field, and flat tire on the final descent that could have ended her race, Courtney stayed calm, thanks to a different mental approach this season.“In the past, I felt like I had to be on every podium to feel success,” said Courtney. “It was an impossible standard and the pressure got to me. The preparation for races would be nearly perfect and I would come completely unhinged on race day. There was a broken connection between training and racing.”In late May, Courtney broke her wrist after the third race of the season, forcing her to step back from the sport and reflect on what wasn’t working. “Initially it felt like my season was going off the rails,” said Courtney, “but in retrospect I really needed the time away.”Sidelined from the World Cup circuit for the first time since she started her professional career, Courtney dropped out of the top 20 in the world rankings, something that hadn’t happened since she was 16 years old. At first this was a hard pill to swallow, but became a crucial inflection point.“What I’m looking for now isn’t just results, but instead to engage meaningfully with the challenges and invest in the process,” said Courtney. “If I approach training and racing as a challenge, it becomes an opportunity for me, without the big weight of external expectations.”Her PT and strength coach, Matt Smith, knew her wrist wasn’t ready to jump back into the rigors of technical short races and encouraged her to try something new. He proposed she try the Leadville 100, America’s most prestigious long distance mountain bike race. Initially Courtney was skeptical, but a day later she bought in. “I found so much freedom in the new challenge. I focused on feel, not numbers or structure. Low external pressure, high intrinsic drive.”On 9 August, Courtney returned to racing, lining up at Leadville. With an early headwind and new rules that restricted women not drafting off men, the pace started slower than she expected. At the first major climb it began to pick up and from there Courtney rode a blistering pace, breaking the long-standing course record by nearly 10 minutes.A week later, Courtney flew to Switzerland with her coach and mechanic, to pre-ride the Marathon Worlds course. “The two weeks before the race was the most fun I’ve had in my entire career,” said Courtney. “I knew my fitness would translate, because it was another seven-hour course with a ton of climbing. Mentally I was just focused on the course and my plan, not anything else.”As a newcomer to marathon races, Courtney flew under the radar, allowing her to race with more freedom. “I took a risk on the second to last climb and went solo,” said Courtney. “On the final fireroad descent I got a rear sidewall flat and just had to hope my tire would hold up until the finish. Those moments are earned, but also given. Things that are out of your control have to go right.”View image in fullscreenKate Courtney won the Cross-Country Marathon (XCM) world championship in the Swiss canton of Valais in September.Photograph: Piotr Staron/Getty ImagesDespite 50 career wins, this one felt different. It had been seven years since her last world championship and in many of those years it felt well out of reach. “It was a healing event for me. I raced at the limit, physically and mentally. It’s the way I hope I’ll be remembered as an athlete.”Courtney had a lot of early success from 2017 to 2019, often at the front of World Cup races. She made the US Olympic Team in 2021, another major highlight. But the extreme pressure in Tokyo and later on the World Cup would get to her, creating a mental hole which took years to dig out of.“I lost a full grasp of the process,” said Courtney. “That was a low period for three or four years, where I wasn’t prepared to compete on the level I wanted to. I was putting a lot in but not getting as much out.”“My dad always says you’re remembered for your best days,” said Courtney, who fell in love with mountain biking by riding a tandem mountain bike with her dad as a kid. “I’ve been lucky to have a few of them, but over this period I learned it’s more important to zoom out and see the bigger picture. I’ve weathered the storm of big challenges and it’s the years that everything didn’t click that almost meant more to me.”Courtney switched coaches at the start of 2024 and began a new training program, designed to get her back to where she wanted to be. The first step was finding the motivation to keep working hard, day in and out. The answer had been in front of her for years, mentoring young women through mountain biking.“The thing that kept me in the sport when I wasn’t performing well was paying it forward and trying to be a role model for young girls,” said Courtney. “It was a way to meaningfully contribute beyond my race results, and I learned they didn’t care if I won or fought to finish after a crash. What was important was how I showed up.”In 2023, Courtney launched the She Sends Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to getting more girls on bikes. “My goal wasn’t about developing the next top level mountain bike racer, but more to use the sport to equip young girls for the real world. Mountain biking is great at teaching lessons, showing girls they can be powerful and confident.”She Sends is part of a cultural shift, Courtney says. “When a woman walks into a bike shop, she should get the same respect as a man. And when she lines up on race day, she should get respect for being a great athlete, not just being ‘great for a female athlete’.”Her main message to young girls is to take risks. “In pushing your edge you find out you’re capable of more. I realized this year that if I was giving girls that message, I needed to live it. I needed to compete at the top level and give myself the opportunity to exhaust my athletic potential.”Despite the new motivation, Courtney’s season started slowly, with poor performances at her first two races and a broken wrist at her third. But, instead of throwing away the season, she decided to pivot.“It’s a matter of how you evaluate your success,” said Courtney. “We often over emphasize the wins instead of the process.” She embraced the new challenges and the results speak for themselves.Explore more on these topicsCyclingUS sportsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

They have won six of their past eight games, which might sound like an impressive run of form, but their defeat at West Ham on Sunday was wretched enough to raise all manner of doubts. Three successiveChampions Leaguewins, though, all without conceding, means they probably need only one more victory from their final four games to secure a place in the playoff round, while two wins and a draw would almost certainly secure a top‑eight place and automatic passage to the last 16.This Newcastle are a team with an extremely high ceiling and a very low floor. They are capable of hammering Union Saint-Gilloise and pummelling Benfica in the Champions League and outplaying Tottenham in the Carabao Cup. But they are also capable of losing 3-1 against West Ham and being grateful it wasn’t worse. They are both the amiable doctor and the vicious criminal, both ferociously energetic winners and lethargic disappointments, both Jekyll and Hyde.Manchester City v Dortmund, Newcastle v Athletic, and more: Champions League – liveRead more“We navigated today really well after the weekend,” Eddie Howe said. “It was important we responded mentally. Our psychology was really good. We’ve had three wins in a row, some good performances and we’re in a good position.”The huge advantage Newcastle have in Europe is that they are bigger than most of their opponents. That has been an ongoing feature of the Champions League this season: Premier League sides have a huge physical advantage over their rivals. Compounding that was Athletic’s baffling reluctance to pick up the biggest bloke in the box every time Newcastle attacked.David Copperfield once made the Statue of Liberty disappear, but even he might baulk at the challenge of making Dan Burn invisible, yet that was what Newcastle achieved as they took the lead after 11 minutes.The Premier League focus on set plays appears to have given them a huge advantage in Europe. Just as Liverpool plagued Real Madrid from corners and free-kicks on Tuesday, so Newcastle tormented Athletic. As Keiran Trippier whipped the ball in from the right, Burn somehow looped unseen round the back of the defence to steer a glorious header inside the far post. “It was a well-worked routine,” Howe said, “a really good ball in. We need to score more from set plays.”Howe also paid tribute to Trippier’s attitude in getting himself back to fitness after illness, and acknowledged Newcastle have missed him.View image in fullscreenDan Burn gave Newcastle an early lead with a fine long-range header from a free-kick.Photograph: Ryan Browne/ProSports/ShutterstockThe Athletic head coach, Ernesto Valverde, said: “I have a bitter taste in my mouth. It was a shame. In the first half they punished us with a free‑kick. It was almost telegraphed, we should have known. It was an obvious move and we fell for it.”Unai Gómez was denied at the near post by the outstretched foot of Nick Pope, and Adama Boiro pinged a snap‑shot off the woodwork but there was always a sense that those chances came against the run of play and that Newcastle’s superior physicality would prevail. In the end they were helped by further poor marking from Athletic, Joelinton left untended six yards out to nod in a Harvey Barnes cross four minutes into the second half.Howe made a triple substitution soon after, an understandable move given the pressure of the calendar. Newcastle lost momentum but they were never anything other than comfortable and for most of the last half‑hour the game was largely an exercise in running down the clock.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Beating Benfica and Athletic at home was vital for Newcastle’s hopes of progression. “These home games were really important,’ Howe said, “and that put an added pressure on us.”The inconsistency is clearly beginning to niggle. “We want to make sure we don’t become that team that’s yoyoing in terms of attitude and intensity,” Howe said, rejecting the idea that his side are becoming a cup team. “I know the players are frustrated, so I don’t think it’s from a lack of effort. If you’re just able to lift yourself for certain moments you never know when that negative side’s going to raise itself.”Brentford away at the weekend will be a very different test – and then comes the relief of the international break and a chance for at least some of the squad to recuperate.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueNewcastle UnitedAthletic BilbaoEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Chaos tends to set in whenever the Italian tries to freshen things up by making use of a deep but raw squad and he is unlikely to be in a rush to rotate again in theChampions Leagueafter seeing a weakened team fail to douse Qarabag’s skill and spirit on a raucous night in Baku.There was no doubt Qarabag were the happier team at the conclusion of this absorbing 2-2 draw.Chelsea, by contrast, were merely grateful that their 5,000-mile round trip to Azerbaijan had not ended in major embarrassment. Not once were they were in control against defiant opposition, even after going ahead through the outstanding Estêvão Willian, and it was hardly ideal that Maresca had to make three changes when his players went down the tunnel with their egos bruised and damage to repair after a shambolic first half.Manchester City v Dortmund, Newcastle v Athletic, and more: Champions League – liveRead moreThrowing on Enzo Fernández, Liam Delap and Alejandro Garnacho so soon was not part of the plan, and it is unlikely that João Pedro staying on for 71 minutes was either. Yet while Chelsea wanted to rest weary limbs their level dips when the understudies come in. Jorrel Hato endured a nightmare in central defence and Maresca was ruthless in removing Andrey Santos, Jamie Gittens and Tyrique George at half-time.He had already lost Roméo Lavia to an early injury, ending hopes of giving Moisés Caicedo the night off in midfield. Chelsea felt the pain. Garnacho rescued a point but a draw leaves their hopes of finishing in the top eight of the league phase in doubt.Chelsea, level withQarabagafter taking seven points from four games, know that tougher tests await. Barcelona visit Stamford Bridge next month. Trips to Atalanta and Napoli pose further complications.Qarabag have made huge strides under their long-serving coach, Gurban Gurbanov. Their quick, adventurous football was a joy to watch and almost made Maresca rue his decision to manage a draining schedule by making seven changes.An upset beckoned. Qarabag were fearless and it was not easy for Chelsea given the noise pouring down from the stands, where the sight of some home fans standing in the aisles added to the air of unruliness.It was mayhem. A starting lineup with an average age of 23 years and 97 days saw Chelsea field the second youngest side by an English club in a Champions League away game. Inexperience explains why the understudies struggle to maintain concentration. It was a similar story when they almost blew a 3-0 leadagainst Wolves last week.View image in fullscreenEstêvão opens the scoring for Chelsea in the first half.Photograph: APMaresca needs to be able to trust them more. He does not want to keep having to turn to Caicedo and Fernández but Dário Essugo is a long-term absentee and Lavia cannot stay fit. “The Club World Cup affected [us] a lot,” Maresca said, suggesting that Chelsea’s extended summer has affected them physically.Chelsea were already without Cole Palmer, Levi Colwill and Pedro Neto. They were uncertain even after bringing on Caicedo. Qarabag ripped forward and targeted the unfamiliar pairing of Hato and Tosin Adarabioyo, who did nothing to help his younger teammate.Hato’s struggles were tough to watch. The 19-year-old almost conceded an early penalty, was bullied by Camilo Durán in the buildup to Leandro Andrade’s equaliser and was at fault when Qarabag went ahead. “They are silly goals to concede,” Maresca acknowledged.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Chelsea looked stunned. They had broken through in the 16th minute.

Qarabag almost recorded the biggest win in their history when Dani Bolt, the substitute, tested Sánchez in added time.It was great fun.

The prime minister, Keir Starmer, called it the “wrong” decision and the opposition leader, Kemi Badenoch, said it was a “national disgrace”.Maccabi announced in September that they would play all four homeEuropa Leaguegames this season in Belgrade. “It is very hard for us,” said Sissokho. “Every home game in Europe we play in Serbia, so it’s a big difference. We know the fans are very important for us. We have to think about them because they will watch the game on the TV. We have to give everything on the pitch to give them a smile and perform as a team. We have to concentrate on the team and play our game with this feeling.”Maccabi’s Serbian head coach, Zarko Lazetic, would not be drawn on whether the ban on away fans was “unfair”, which was how the decision was described by the club’s chief executive, Jack Angelides.View image in fullscreenMaccabi Tel Aviv’s Issouf Sissokho faces the media before the match.Photograph: Jacob King/PALazetic said: “Unfair or fair, in the world I am not one who judges about that but on the pitch it is 11 v 11 and we will try to do our best.” Asked if Maccabi’s squad had discussed the political backdrop, Lazetic confirmed they had but refused to elaborate, adding only: “We are only focusing on the football.”On Wednesday evening West Midlands police confirmed section 60 powers will be in place from midday on Thursday until 3am on Friday.Policehorses, police dogs and a drone unit will be in use.Ch Supt Tom Joyce said: “Our message to those from all communities in Birmingham is that we have listened and will continue to engage with you.

He posted on X: “Local politicians and community leaders should be doing everything they can to improve education in areas like Aston and Lozells, not inflaming tensions and calling for boycotts, bans and protests that result in schools being closed early. What a disgrace.”Villa have warned supporters against displaying political symbols, messages or flags during the match. In announcing their ticketing policy, the club reminded fans about not breaking Uefa protocols. Villa also imposed sanctions on those wanting to buy tickets, saying only supporters with a purchase history from before this season will be able to access a ticket. The club also warned against supporters reselling their tickets.Protesters stood at the entrance of Villa’s Bodymoor Heath training ground on Wednesday displaying a Palestine flag and a message that read: “Shame on Villa, shame on Uefa, shame on the FA.” Villa’s manager, Unai Emery, did not answer questions relating to the situation surrounding the fixture. “It’s Europe and we are playing in Europe against very good teams,” Emery said.“Firstly, it’s about our respect for the Europa League, for the competition.

The Tottenham defender was out with a friend on the night of Saturday 6 September when the alleged incident occurred.Police were called and the agent was detained on suspicion of brandishing the weapon with intent to cause fear of violence. The suspect was also investigated for allegedly blackmailing and making threats against Udogie’s friend. He has not been charged with any offence. There is no suggestion that the agent concerned is Udogie’s agent.The alleged incident happened during the September international break, when Udogie was not involved with Italy. He has not taken any time out from the game and was back in action for Spurs in their next fixture – the leaguewin at West Hamon 13 September, when he came on as a substitute.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Udogie’s name was first revealed in Italy a few hours beforeTottenham kicked off their Champions League home gameagainst Copenhagen on Tuesday – with the defender in the starting lineup.A Spurs spokesperson said: “We have been providing support for Destiny and his family since the incident and will continue to do so.

Palace face two games in three days either way and apparently are prioritising theCarabao Cup.“We’re trying to move the Leeds game forwards to Saturday so that we have two days between these games,” Glasner said with reference to the Arsenal tie. “Let’s see. We didn’t get a response until now from the Premier League, so just to have the same situation as Arsenal if their game is moved.”Glasner, preparing for Thursdaytonight’s Conference League match at home against the Dutch side AZ, said: “I think I’m always talking about making mistakes as part of development, and I think the EFL and Premier League didn’t solve this problem before the start of the season. They will learn from it and I’m pretty sure that next year they will have the solution before the start of the season.”Quick GuidePlay our new game: On the ballShowThe Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles withthe launch of its first daily football game, On the ball.

If they contest the charge, it would be heard by an independent panel.

Uefa’s decision to rule that Textor held a controlling interest in both clubs, meaning they could not both play in the Europa League, occurred only after a drawn-out saga, and Marinakis had reportedly written to the governing body to raise concerns about Palace’s ownership.Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceNottingham ForestThe FALeeds UnitedCarabao CupPremier LeagueEuropa LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

For Kylian Mbappé and Vinícius Júnior on Tuesday, read Erling Haaland on Sunday. Nullifying another of the game’s finest strikers, while keeping a third clean sheet in a row, would reinforce Slot’s post-Madrid message that Liverpool remain in the chase for the biggest prizes.They do not include the Carabao Cup.TheChampions League victoryover Xabi Alonso’s La Liga leaders, who had 13 wins from 14 games before their arrival at Anfield, was the perfect remedy for a Liverpool team looking to heal the wounds of the worst run of Slot’s reign. It was also perfect preparation for what awaits at the Etihad Stadium: an opponent that wants to play out, that will not sit in a low block and carries an obvious, rampant threat.Bradley shuts down Vinícius and shows Liverpool he can be right-back for future | Nick AmesRead moreSlot’s instructions to his team at Anfield included containing the source of 18 of Madrid’s 26 goals in La Liga this season, Mbappé and Vinícius, both of whom will be glad of a break from Conor Bradley. Providing Bradley hasn’t tracked them back to Spain, that is.Liverpoolsucceeded convincingly, becoming only the third team to prevent Mbappé from scoring against them in a season in which the France international has produced 18 goals in 15 appearances for his club. Haaland has 17 in 13 games for City before his reunion with Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Wednesday – plus nine in three outings with Norway. The objective is clear for Liverpool in their attempts to stage a repeat on Sunday.“It will be similar a little bit,” said Virgil van Dijk, who dominated Haaland at Anfield last season when Liverpool followed upa 2-0 win against Madridwitha 2-0 defeat of Pep Guardiola’s team. “We are facing a very in-form team like today and a striker, like today, who was in form. When that happens you have to be spot-on and I think we showed we were good as a team defensively. Defensively we were very solid. We created good opportunities and they had a goalkeeper that saved them a couple of times.”View image in fullscreenArne Slot (right) embraces Conor Bradley at full time.Photograph: Alan Martin/Colorsport/ShutterstockSlot’s list of reasons for why things went right for Liverpool against Madrid –and Aston Villa on Saturday for that matter– were consistent with his explanations for why things went wrong during a run of six defeats in seven games: more recovery time between games, not conceding first and having to take more risks, and the improving fitness of players such as Alexis Mac Allister and Bradley after injury-hit pre-seasons. They backed up his previous arguments and decision in effect to sacrifice the Carabao Cup by fielding a weakened squad against Crystal Palace. Liverpool’s intensity and work rate on Tuesday were noticeably superior to recent weeks.Other reasons, specifically connected to a second clean sheet in succession after 10 games without one, went unsaid. The return of last season’s midfield core of Dominik Szoboszlai, Mac Allister and Ryan Gravenberch enhanced the protection to Liverpool’s backline. The overdue return at left-back of Andy Robertson, who has started each of Liverpool’s past three wins, restored calmness and authority to a defence that also benefited from consistent selection. Florian Wirtz enjoyed another good night in the Champions League but not in the No 10 role he has occupied in the Premier League. Szoboszlai was again Liverpool’s driving influence in the centre. The Hungary captain is flourishing this season and has established himself as a leader in Slot’s side.“What you see is what you get from Dom,” said Van Dijk. “He is very important. The energy he brings on the pitch is incredible, the quality that he has is outstanding and he is learning each and every game. He is developing into the player we all feel like he could be. He is already showing that for the country he is playing for and it is about keeping on doing it for the rest of the season.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Guardiola was asked about Foden being recalled.“There’s no person in this country, no one around the world, that doesn’t know his quality and ability,” said the manager. “But England is so lucky to have a mountain of good players – so in this position, there are a lot, and that’s why Phil has to push himself to be better and better.“He has to say: ‘OK, I’m going to show how good I am.’ Thomas knows perfectly how good Phil is and I’m sure he will do the best for your country.”Guardiola believes Foden has now returned to the top of his form. “This season, he’s back, yeah,” the Catalan said. “When Phil is at that level, when playing between the lines, in the pockets, his first contact, his turn, [he is very good] and after his generosity, running and fighting.“He’s a special player, but we need his goals, definitely. And today he makes, hopefully, the first step to do it [consistently] before the big match on Sunday.”That is Liverpool’s visit to the Etihad Stadium, of which Guardiola said: “It’s a top team.

Hooliganism is also a major concern for European football’s governing body, Uefa.The investigation was launched after the 2023 fatal injury of a 31-year-old riot police officer, George Lyngeridis, in clashes outside a women’s volleyball match between Olympiakos and Panathinaikos, a normally low-risk game.View image in fullscreenMasked police officers were on duty outside Athens’ high security Korydallos prison when the trial over sports-related violence began on Wednesday.Photograph: Louiza Vradi/ReutersBefore that match, some of the fans moved a bag of flares and makeshift explosives from a storage room at their football stadium to the volleyball venue, the investigation found. Lyngeridis was hit by a flare during the clashes and died from his injuries weeks later.It was Greece’s third fatality in sports violence in 2022-2023 and prompted the top court prosecutor to urge a clampdown on criminal gangs linked with sports.Explore more on these topicsOlympiakosNottingham ForestnewsShareReuse this content"

In the beginning it was a bit difficult to return, so I’m pretty happy that I managed to win in two sets in the end.”Rybakina arrived for the clash after victories over Anisimova and Swiatek but the former Wimbledon champion came under pressure against a fresh Alexandrova, before breaking in the ninth game and then claiming the opening set with a hold.The Kazakh, who staved off three breakpoints in the first set, cranked up her huge serve and heavy hitting early in the second to go 3-1 up and applied the squeeze to close in on another win in the Serena Williams group.Another break, courtesy of a powerful return of serve, left Rybakina one game away and the 26-year-old eventually wrapped up the victory despite some struggles on her own delivery late in the clash.World No 1 Aryna Sabalenka takes on Coco Gauff on Thursday with both players in contention for a semi-final place from the Steffi Graf group while Jessica Pegula can boost her own chances when she meets the eliminated Jasmine Paolini.ReutersShareUpdated at14.32 EST"

Is the platform safe for children – or an ‘X-rated paedophile hellscape’?Sarah MartinWed 5 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 19.35 ESTShareI am an eight-year-old girl, standing near-naked in a room full of strangers.As the room spins and zooms upon me and people glide around me, I clock my features.I don’t look eight. I look like a grey Barbie doll, complete with cleavage and bare feet locked uncomfortably in the high-heel position. I have a large block head that resembles a grey marshmallow.I’m in theworld of Roblox, where block-like avatars transform themselves to explore a universe comprising millions of user-generated games. The platform boasts more than 100 million active daily users. Almost half are children under 13 and, in Australia, a 2024 study found that children who used the site play for anaverage of 137 minutesa day.On Wednesday, the eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, saidRobloxwould not be captured by Australia’s new social media ban but warned it remained “on the line” as the ban was continually assessed.“We’re using other tools in our arsenal to keep these other platforms safer … just because a platform is exempted through the legislative rules doesn’t mean it’s safe.”Over the course of a week I log on to the platform as a child to experience first-hand the gaming app of choice for Australian children. In my short time there my avatar is cyberbullied, aggressively killed, sexually assaulted and shat on – all with parental control settings in place.My skinny grey self starts by visiting one of the most popular “experiences” for young girls, a game called Dress to Impress which has had more than 6bn visits since its November 2023 launch. At its peak, the game had more than a million concurrent users. Vogue has reported that adult fashion junkies have joined the game’s devoted child fanbase, while the game has been promoted as a “household brand in fashion and gaming”.Clumsily, while soundtracked by a smooth synth jazz track, I begin to explore. The gap between my thighs is almost as wide as my waist is narrow.OK. I’m starting to get it. I have to choose an outfit according to a theme as a clock counts down. Some areas – including the VIP Lounge – are off limits unless I spend real cash, known across Roblox as “Robux”, but otherwise I have a small department store of clothes and accessories to choose from.I hustle to assemble a “sci-fi” outfit, scrambling to find clothes and work out how to put them on.In DTI’s makeup room, I find a number of heavily made-up faces.Photograph: DTI/RobloxI spot a scanty two-piece number but am yet to find a face.Oh, a knife! Yes. I might need that.Cat ears? Why not.Still hunting for a face, I try the makeup room. Here a dozen or so heavily made-up faces are on offer, with looks ranging from RuPaul to Ziggy Stardust.I end up with a Bratz doll-like head on some kind of stripper Barbie body.Getting here was easy. On sign-up Roblox asked for a username (specifying it should not be my real name) and a date of birth. It asked me to tick a box confirming that “your parent/guardian permits you to create this account and agrees to our Terms of Use”. Sure.View image in fullscreenPlayers strut the catwalk and are rated on a scale of one to five stars.Photograph: DTI/RobloxThe point of the game I’m now in – known as DTI to its fans – is to dress and be judged by my fellow players.Once the five-minute countdown finishes, players strut the catwalk and are rated on a scale of one to five stars, with rivals able to chat or post commentary in the open chat box. Players can strike a variety of poses – some are free, while other “pose packs” cost Robux.I give everyone five stars, hoping to boost any flailing confidence among other users.Players discuss the appearance of others in the chat box that seems as often disparaging as it is encouraging. The game’s latest update lets them throw tomatoes at other contestants or surround them witha virtual pile of shit.View image in fullscreenMy avatar walks into the basement ‘meat room’ in Dress to Impress.Photograph: DTI/RobloxWhile promoted as a kids’ game and an outlet for creative fashionistas, a dive into the world of DTI reveals the game’s darker side.I discover a basement “meat room” – which looks as though you’ve walked into someone’s uterus – hiding a pair of stilettos and a locked door. Other secret rooms are part of the game’s “lore”, offering creepy suggestions that a woman has gone missing. A previous update included a dungeon with a woman locked in a cage.‘Pay to troll’ featuresDTI’s devoted fanbase is getting restless.Users are complaining of updates that force them to spend more Robux to remain competitive. The increasing monetisation of children’s games is a widespread criticism of the platform.Marcus Carter, a professor in human-computer interaction at the University of Sydney, likens the site’s in-game spending promotions to “child gambling”, pointing to countless casino games and “loot boxes” within games that are readily available to children.View image in fullscreenThe game Suffer is rated as suitable for children aged five and older.Photograph: Suffer/RobloxHe spent a fruitless three weeks trying to get a refund for a lootbox bought as a 12-year-old on the grounds that they are illegal to sell to children in Australia.He has also tracked the rising phenomenon of “pay to troll” features – such as the shit-throwing on DTI – which incentivise bullying and prompt players to pay real money to do so.“Roblox games are actually monetising that kind of desire to troll and mess with and negatively impact other players,” he says.What is Roblox? Everything you need to know about the online game platformRead moreRoblox is big business. It is a US$92bn listed company in the US, owned predominantly by institutional investors. The chief executive, David Baszucki, owns about 10% of the company’s stock.Successful game creators – many of them children –can make money. In 2024-25 the company’s developer exchange program paid out more than $1bn through a convoluted payment plan under which the company keeps at least 30% of transactions made on the site.Developers earn Robux and can cash out US dollars once they make a certain amount. Last year’s median payout figure was US$1,400.Carter says while the platform does allow children to learn how to code their dream game, Roblox is essentially exploiting child labour through play – termed “playbour”.“Roblox really celebrates these instances of teenagers becoming millionaires because their games blow up on Roblox but this is all child labour,” he says. “All of its income comes from the games that its users are making.”Roblox has rejected suggestions it relies on child labour, saying most of its developers are over the age of 18.View image in fullscreenA player sits on my face and thrusts his hips while I implore him to leave me alone.Photograph: Vibe Place/RobloxCarter says venture capital-backed firms are buying popular games, with teams of developers and data analysts working out how best to extract more money out of their child player base.This year a leading Roblox role-playing game, Brookhaven, was bought by the game developer Voldex with the backing of the venture capital firms Raine Partners and Shamrock Capital.Other big businesses are moving in. This month the toy brand Mattel announced it would be expanding its gaming business in collaboration with Roblox and Fortnite, launching a Monster High game with other of its brands, including Barbie and Hot Wheels, to follow. Last weekthe AFL also announcedit was launching an official Roblox game to connect with gen Z and gen alpha users.DTI’s popularity has brought it high-profile collaborations with Lady Gaga and Charli xcx. It has released a line of DTI dolls and is promoting a forthcoming Wicked: For Good release to coincide with the film’s US release next month.View image in fullscreenOne of Roblox’s countless casino-like games where children can play to win ‘Robux’ using real money.Photograph: Arcade Island/RobloxBut as the game has become more mainstream, complaints are growing about inappropriate content for children.Last month DTI removed a new pose called “serve it” – bending over from the hips – after a backlash. A Reddit post in response to that release was titled: “Someone needs to warn the parents.”Then there are users who dress in “fits” that look naked, despite the presence of young children on the game. Roblox says DTI is suitable for children aged five and over.View image in fullscreen‘Fresh meat’ on Prison Pump – ‘It isn’t long before four giant “hombres” beat the life out of me’.Photograph: Prison Pump/RobloxIn seeking to understand who is responsible for the game being played by millions of children worldwide, I stumble across yet another layer of complexity in the Roblox ecosystem. It’s incredibly difficult to find out who owns and operates each experience.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All the information in the public domain suggests that DTI is largely owned, managed and moderated by teenagers.Information released by Roblox shows DTI was developed by a user known only as “Gigi”. Gigi, whose gender and nationality are not provided, claims to have been 16 when the game was released and started developing it at 14.The trouble with Roblox, the video game empire built on child labourRead moreLast year, responding to allegations of inappropriate interactions aired on social media,Gigiadmitted to making “a vile and disgusting” joke about rape and to making fatphobic jokes. They also admitted to hosting a NSFW (not safe for work, meaning “adult content”) server on the Discord messaging and social media platform while underage.“I want to be clear, no pictures of minors were ever shared,” Gigi says. “Yes, it was a NSFW server, which in hindsight is really gross and inappropriate, but at the time I was literally just a bored kid.”The immaturity of the game’s management team was evident this year when serious allegations were raised against one of DTI’s most senior employees.A 20-year-old administrator was accused of grooming a 16-year-old. This had happened outside the game on an unrelated server.In response to the allegations, the staff member released a statement saying they had become friends with someone who “while not legally under the age of consent, was still too young for me to have become friends with at the time”.“I made very inappropriate jokes and said very inappropriate things,” the administrator said, revealing that they had been experiencing depression, anxiety and severe body image dysmorphia at the time.The imbroglio prompted the game’s manager – an 18-year-old known as Umoyae Free Spirit – toannouncethat the employee had been dismissed.Pushing Buttons: With the safety of Roblox under scrutiny, how worried should parents be?Read moreShe said the game was “considering making the moderation team 18+”.While Roblox claims responsibility for managing its “community standards” on the site, including cases of abuse, the company has sought to exempt itself from laws relating to social media by arguing it is merely a platform hosting other people’s games.A Roblox spokesperson said the platform was “committed to leading in safety through rigorous policies that go above and beyond what other platforms do”.“We use AI to check for violative content before a game is published, we do not allow users to share images or videos in chat, and we use advanced text filters designed to stop kids from sharing personal information,” he said.Guardian Australia contacted the manager of Dress to Impress for comment but did not receive a response.‘Perfect place for paedophiles’Roblox has long facedaccusations of being an unsafe platform for childrenand being frequented by paedophiles. In late 2024 the investment investigator Hindenburg Research called it “an X-rated paedophile hellscape”.Since then, the company has been hit with multiple lawsuits in the US, outlining tragic circumstances in which minors were groomed online and abused.In August theattorney general of Louisiana allegedthat Roblox’s safety failings had created “the perfect place for paedophiles”.A lawsuit filed in California in July is seeking damages for an 11-year-old who was violently raped after she was groomed on the platform by a now-convicted paedophile. The case accuses Roblox and Discord of “systemic failures to protect society’s most vulnerable from unthinkable harm in pursuit of financial gain over child safety”.View image in fullscreenComing under fire in the game Suffer.Photograph: Suffer/RobloxIn another lawsuit, a mother of a 15-year-old who took his own life accused Roblox of “recklessly and deceptively operating their business in a way that led to the sexual exploitation and suicide” of her son.Roblox does not comment on pending litigation but after the Louisiana lawsuit was launchedit said​: “Every day, tens of millions of people around the world use Roblox to learn STEM skills, play, and imagine and have a safe experience on our platform. Any assertion that Roblox would intentionally put our users at risk of exploitation is simply untrue.”Does video game monetisation harm children – and what is Australia doing about it?Read moreAt the same time as the flurry of lawsuits, the platform controversially banned a user called Schlep after the Texas-based YouTuber, himself previously groomed on the site, worked with law enforcement to pose as a young gamer and out predators.Roblox issued him with a cease-and-desist order and removed him from the platform.In Australia the eSafety commissioner has been negotiating with the company on a range of new safety measures after raising concerns about “child grooming risks”. By the end of the year the companyhas committed to making accounts for under-16s private by defaultand introducing tools to prevent adults from contacting them without parental consent.A number of key features will be switched off by default for children in Australia, such as direct chat and “experience chat” within games, until the player has gone through age estimation. Parents will be able to disable chat for 13- to 15-year-olds.“While no system is ever perfect, we have made over 100 safety enhancements this year alone to help protect our users and give parents more tools to manage and monitor their child’s online experience,” the company spokesman said.But, as I continue my experiment logged on to the platform as a child, I come across many more experiences that are clearly inappropriate.In one game – a vibe hangout where I am logged in as a 13-year-old – it doesn’t take long for another avatar to sexually assault me. He sits on my face and repeatedly thrusts his hips while I implore him to leave me alone.A group of male avatars later call me an “ugly bacon dirty gross girl” in reference to the bacon-like hair on my rookie default avatar.In another popular role-playing game – Berry Avenue – someone follows me around and pretends to shit on my head and face, calling me a toilet.View image in fullscreenI can access bathroom simulator games, dungeons, casinos, horror games, escape rooms and countless role-playing games where I can send and receive messages from strangers.Photograph: Coin Pusher/RobloxAnother game my eight-year-old avatar can access with all parental controls in place is called Suffer. After entering and arming myself with an axe and an ice-hockey mask I am immediately machine-gunned down.A friend reports that her 10-year-old son is hooked on a game called Prison Pump. I’m called “fresh meat” on entry and taunted for being a weakling. I have to start pumping iron or pay for more muscle. It isn’t long before four giant “hombres” beat the life out of me.I can access bathroom simulator games, dungeons, casinos, horror games, escape rooms and countless role-playing games where I can send and receive messages from strangers.The number of inappropriate games I can access while logged on as a child appears endless.It’s for this reason Carter, who is keen to emphasise the positive benefits from gaming and digital play, says he doesn’t have a good answer when parents ask him how they can know their children are safe on Roblox.“My son is four and I do not intend to ever let him play Roblox,” he says. “My life is about video games; I am a professor of games at the University of Sydney, I love games, my son and I are going to be playing lots of games together – but not Roblox.”Do you know more?

The unanimous ruling cleared the way for a federal judge to enforce a potentially disruptive shake-up that’s designed to give consumers more choices.The specific terms of the settlement agreement remain under seal and must be approved by US district judge James Donato, but the two companies broadly outlined some of their agreements in their joint filing. A hearing is set for Thursday.They said the settlement closely follows Donato’s October 2024 ruling ordering Google to tear down the digital walls shielding its Android app store from competition. That included a provision that will require its app store to distribute rival third-party app stores so consumers can download them to their phones, if they so desire.The curious case of Epic Games: how the developer beat Google but not AppleRead moreGoogle had hoped to void those changes with an appeal, but the ruling issued in July by the ninth circuit court of appeals delivered a legal blow for the tech company, which has been waylaid in three separate antitrust trials affecting different pillars of its internet empire.EpicGamesfiled lawsuits targeting Google’s Play Store as well as Apple’s iPhone App Store in 2020 in an attempt to bypass exclusive payment processing systems that charged 15% to 30% commissions on in-app transactions. The settlement agreement proposed Tuesday calls for Google to limit those payments to between 9% and 20%, depending on the transaction.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyGoogleFortniteAlphabetGamesnewsShareReuse this content"

Perplexity’s system posed security risks to customer data, Amazon alleged, and the startup had ignored repeated requests to stop.“Rather than be transparent, Perplexity has purposely configured its CometAI software to not identify the Comet AI agent’s activities in the Amazon Store,” it said.In the complaint, Amazon accused Perplexity’s Comet AI agent of degrading customers’ shopping experience and interfering with its ability to ensure customers who use the agent benefit from the tailored shopping experience Amazon curated over decades.Third-party apps making purchases for users should operate openly and respect businesses’ decisions on whether to participate, Amazon said in an earlier statement.Perplexity earlier said it had received a legal threat from Amazon demanding that it block the Comet AI agent from shopping on the platform, calling the move a broader threat to user choice and the future of AI assistants.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How will the world decide to use it?For parents who have buried infants born too soon, a device like the AquaWomb is a miracle in waiting – and an impossible choiceLucy TuWed 5 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 09.27 ESTShareBeth Schafer lay in a hospital bed, bracing for the birth of her son. The first contractions rippled through her body before she felt remotely ready. She knew, with a mother’s pit-of-the-stomach intuition, that her baby was not ready either.At just 23 weeks of gestation, her son teetered on the cliff edge of viability, the fragile threshold where modern medicine offers any promise of keeping babies alive.Beth’s son did not – could not – cry when he was born. The instant his entire body, small enough to cradle in a single palm, landed in the delivering doctor’s latexed hand, a swarm of blue scrubs closed in to begin resuscitation. But despite their fervent attempts to triage, to coax air into his tiny, caved-in lungs, they could not supply what Beth’s son needed most: more time in the womb.Beth is a 39-year-old painter turned graphic designer whose round frames and dark, frenzied bangs give her the look of an art student who never outgrew the studio. She will make you a mug of tea before you think to ask, the kind of person who says “I love that for you” and means every syllable. This is why I know she is not hyperbolizing when she talks about her perfect, precious son.“I would have moved mountains for him,” Beth tells me, two years after his birth.This kind of device would create a new stage of human development, something we’ve never had to describe or regulate beforeElizabeth Chloe RomanisScientists worldwide are racing to buy more time for extremely premature babies like Beth’s. In 2017, researchers in Philadelphia unveiled an experimental lifeline:an artificial womb, engineered to gestate babies outside the human body.In their study’s photos, fetal lambs floated inside what looked like overgrown Ziploc bags, eyes closed and hearts pumping as if they had never left their mothers. That prototype was only tested on animals, but the technology is edging closer to human use.In September 2023, the United States Food and Drug Administration convened an advisory committee to consider whether to greenlight the first clinical trials. If approved, the first candidates will be babies like Beth’s son, those born between 22 and 24 weeks of gestation, or less than two-thirds of the way to full term. (FDA representatives declined to comment on whether or when these trials might begin.)In the US,more than 10,000 infantsare born each year within these precarious boundaries. Premature birth remains the nation’ssecond-leading causeof infant death, and even those who survive may face crippling complications, from chronic lung disease to lifelong neurological damage.Artificial wombs promise to change that trajectory, saving more babies and sparing more parents from grief. But growing a child outside the body also cuts to the core of how people imagine pregnancy and parenthood.“This kind of device would create a new stage of human development, something we’ve never had to describe or regulate before,” says Elizabeth Chloe Romanis, a medical law scholar at Durham University.In this way, artificial wombs tug at a taut tightrope of questions that scientists, bioethicists and legal experts are scrambling to cross before human trials begin: how will this technology affect the ways we intervene in preserving life, or how we define life itself?When I first see the prototype, I don’t think of a womb. I think of an aquarium.The glass tank rests on a waist-high platform in a bright laboratory in Aachen, Germany, one of the sites affiliated with AquaWomb, a Dutch startup that is developing devices to improve health outcomes for the smallest, sickest infants.About the size of a household fishtank, the vessel sits under fluorescent lights so technicians can monitor every movement inside, though in practice it would be covered to mimic the dimness of the womb. Tubes coil from the sides into filters that cycle synthetic amniotic fluid in rhythmic glugs.The design feels apt for extremely premature infants, who often arrive looking as though they belong to another world entirely – skin translucent and gelatinous, limbs thin as matchsticks. In this tank, those babies could float, drink, urinate and grow without touching air.View image in fullscreenReplica premature babies.Photograph: TU/e [Eindhoven University of Technology/Bart van OverbeekeMyrthe van der Ven, a technical physician and the co-founder and CEO of AquaWomb, shows me how their prototype mimics the constant shelter of pregnancy. The amniotic fluid holds at 99.7F, just above a mother’s core temperature. A double-layered bag hangs in the tank’s center. Its inner sac flexes as the baby grows, from pomegranate-sized at 23 weeks to the heft of an eggplant by 28. The outer silicone layer is stiffer, with just enough give to resist the baby’s kicks and encourage its muscles to stretch and strengthen.The tank, van der Ven tells me, is the simple part. The lungs are the true liability.During a typical birth, a newborn’s first gulp of air triggers the breathing reflex, often announced with a wail that signals lungs at work. That moment comes too early for extremely premature infants: their runty lungs can’t sustain even a whisper, much less nourish the developing brain and body.It’s like juggling 10 balls … only the balls are on fire and dropping one is not an optionIn today’s neonatal intensive care units, doctors can only step in after the fact, using ventilators and incubators to force these fragile organs to function. That mechanical intervention brings its own risks of lasting injury. And once exposed to air, the lungs are irreversibly activated; you can’t throw the fish back into the water.Artificial wombs aim to bypass this crisis altogether. In AquaWomb’s design, the baby is delivered via caesarean section into a fluid-filled pouch, where it can be transferred from mother to machine. Once inside the transfer chamber, clinicians reattach the umbilical cord to a human-made placenta, a fist-sized device lined with catheters delicate enough to pull carbon dioxide from the blood and cannulas robust enough to push oxygen and nutrients in.If it works, the placenta buys time that the baby’s lungs cannot yet provide. If it fails, the clock runs out in two minutes, the limit before oxygen deprivation risks permanent brain damage. The baby must remain immersed in fluid throughout this entire sequence, never realizing it is being born.“It’s like juggling 10 balls,” says Frans van de Vosse, a professor in cardiovascular biomechanics at Eindhoven University of Technology who advises the project. “Only the balls are on fire and dropping one is not an option.”If perfected, an artificial womb could rewrite the limits of viability. Perhaps this is why the handful of labs working on these machines hesitate even to name them.AquaWomb describes its prototype as a “womb-like life support system”. (They are wary of the political and science-fiction associations attached to the term “artificial womb”.) And the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), considered the closest group to human clinical trials, called theirs a “biobag”. CHOP’s device made headlines in 2017, when researchers kept fetal lambs alive for 28 days, proving an artificial womb could sustain blood circulation and organ development in a living animal.The entire field operates under a veil of secrecy. CHOP representatives declined to comment for this story. (Vitara Biomedical, the private company that licensed CHOP’s artificial womb technology, has raised more than$125m, a sign they might be preparing for clinical trials.) Some researchers told me CHOP scientists have agreed to collaboration meetings, then backed out.The guardedness reflects both the scrutiny surrounding reproductive technology and the knowledge that, as van der Ven puts it, “in science, there’s evolutionary and there’s revolutionary”. An artificial womb would be the latter.Her team is not trying to win the race at all costs. “We don’t need to be the first. We want to be the best,” she says. For her, that means designing a system where parents can interact with their gestating babies, a priority she feels other researchers have overlooked. One AquaWomb prototype includes access ports that let parents touch their infants. Another features a “uterus phone”, which pipes voices, music or heartbeats into the fluid at the same muffled pitch a fetus would hear in the womb.Those parent-child interactions – pressing a fingertip against a foot, speaking into the fluid, feeling a shift inside the bag – could improvelong-termhealthoutcomesfor premature infants. But the stakes of parental bonding during pregnancy go beyond survival statistics.Research on families’ experiences within-vitro fertilization and surrogacysuggests that when pregnancy departs from the normal course, parents – especially mothers – may struggle to feel like proper caregivers. Extremely premature births can invokesimilarfeelings, in part because prematurity is usually caused by medical complications with the mother rather than the child.“They may not feel they’ve fulfilled their ‘duty’ to protect and carry their child,” says Romanis. Sheargues that any ethical alternativeto “natural” pregnancy must address parents’ emotional needs alongside infants’ physiological ones.In other words, seeing your baby suspended in a tank or sealed in a bag could alter not only how you connect with them, but how you see yourself as a parent.Three months after losing her son, Beth joined a biweekly support group for parents who have experienced late-term pregnancy loss or whose newborns died soon after birth, often because of extreme prematurity. Attenders discuss what to do with unopened baby gifts or how to deflect well-meaning questions from relatives and co-workers. Many are parents of children who might have been prime candidates for an artificial womb.When Beth invites me to join her, I picture a lecture hall or hospital conference room. Instead, we arrive at the basement of a Boston church, where Wendy, a therapist who leads the group, arranges a circle of folding chairs. Attenders trickle in.View image in fullscreenJuliette van Haren with research components for a transfer device and artificial womb for premature babies.Photograph: TU/e [Eindhoven University of Technology/Bart van OverbeekeOnly one of today’s 17 attenders is a man. (He and his husband lost their daughter when their surrogate miscarried late in pregnancy.) Across from me sits a girl who looks too young to order a drink at the bar, let alone to have already had and buried a baby. Her peroxide blond hair brushes the salt-and-pepper nest of Joanne, who is nearly 60 and has been attending for three years, having joined the group over a decade after losing her son. The group also includes an English professor, stay-at-home mom, police officer and pediatric nurse.In this circle, I see how pregnancy loss is unequally borne, but grief is indiscriminate.No one knows how long the group has existed. Membership is word-of-mouth. “We tried making a Facebook group once,” Beth tells me, “But it got overtaken by anti-vaxxers asking if we’d had the Covid vaccine.”“And then my account got suspended because I told them to fuck off,” Joanne snorts. “When I lost my baby, I also lost my patience for dealing with grown-ass babies.”Wendy lays a hand on Joanne’s wrist and winks at me. “As you can see, we’re very open here. You can ask us about your baby bags.”“Biobags”, I utter through hiccupy laughs, unprepared for their nonchalance. I explain that the technology is still several years from hospitals, and even then, would probably be offered only to infants born at 22 or 23 weeks, who have paltry alternatives.“I lost my baby at 22 weeks,” Joanne interrupts. “Are you saying this could have saved him?”“Maybe,” I admit. “But not necessarily. Hypothetically, if your doctors thought he was a candidate for an artificial womb, would you have …”“Absolutely,” Joanne insists. “All I wanted was to save him. If my body couldn’t do that, then maybe this womb thing could.”The parents crave more morsels of information to feed their hypotheticals:Could my baby have survived at 21 weeks? How much would it cost? Would I be able to see my daughter? Hold her?Two women grimace when I describe the prototypes, but the others lean forward and ask for photographs. They picture their children in an artificial womb, submerged in the soothing embrace of synthetic dreams.These parents do not know exactly what the technology could have given them, but it is agonizingly clear that they understand what they have lost without it. Most have not disassembled their babies’ cribs. The pediatric nurse contemplates switching specialties because she cannot be around newborns without wanting to cry. And Beth often clutches her belly as she speaks, like she is cradling a child who is no longer there.Maybe there is a future world where every parent can access this technology … How will they know whether it’s the right decisionWendyEach parent is haunted by what could have been done differently. Most cling to the idea that more intervention, more technology, might have saved their babies.Wendy hesitates. “Is more always better?” She recounts delivering her daughter via C-section at 24 weeks and begging her doctors to administer aggressive care. Despite the precarious birth, the doctors saved Wendy’s baby in the operating room, compressing her chest to churn blood to her brain. For four months in the Nicu (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit), her daughter lived tethered to lines and flushed with drugs. These were costly, painful procedures. But her stunted lungs needed more time to mature.Wendy needed more time, too. “The prognosis was bad, but when it comes to your kid, you can’t help but keep praying for a miracle. I couldn’t let her go.”After 131 days, her daughter died from a collapsed lung. For months, Wendy was racked with guilt, hot and salty grief leaking down her face. “I felt so selfish,” she says. “Even though I eventually let go of those feelings, I wish I’d given her a more peaceful, less prolonged end.”Although she supports the development of artificial wombs, Wendy wonders how doctors will obtain informed consent from parents who are desperate to save their babies. “Maybe there is a future world where every parent can access this technology,” she says. “How will they know whether it’s the right decision? For the baby, or for them.”“I can’t stop looking at the photos of the lambs in the baggies,” Beth tells me, a week after my first visit to her support group. “Probably should stop doing it right before lunch.”Thefootage of CHOP’s animal trialsunsettled her, not only the sight of slick pink bodies drifting in fluid, but also its eerie resemblance to a scene from The Matrix, where human infants are farmed in industrial pods.For decades, scientists and science-fiction writers alike have been chasing the stork. In 1958, a Swedish team tried to sustainseven “pre-viable” human fetusesin what was essentially a pressure-cooker incubator with a pump to oxygenate blood. Their test lasted only a few hours, and modern ethics boards would recoil at the crude attempt to create an artificial womb. Still, what had once been a thought experiment briefly took on flesh.Today’s artificial womb prototypes are neither capable of nor designed to supplant natural pregnancy. Nonetheless, when CHOP published its research on biobags, it birthed a stream of sensational speculations around “complete ectogenesis”, where fertilization to birth occurs entirely outside a woman’s uterus.Researchers have tried to tamp down those associations, positioning their work as a giant leap forward for science but an unremarkable tiptoe for parenthood.View image in fullscreenThe Perinatal Life Support system from startup AquaWomb focuses on a safe transition from the mother to the baby’s water incubator. Here, a specially developed, realistic and advanced baby doll demonstrates how this could happen.Photograph: TU/e [Eindhoven University of Technology/Bart van Overbeeke“The concept of complete ectogenesis is so far away that it’s not worth talking about in relation to the current work,” says one scientist working on artificial wombs. (He speaks to me on the condition of anonymity to avoid upsetting his public relations representative.) “Premature babies die every day, and this technology could save at least some of them. If you want to sit around debating The Matrix, you’re missing the point.”Other experts believe these concerns can’t be brushed aside.“There is no such thing as ‘not worth talking about’ when it comes to procreative futures. Science fiction and science fact aren’t so far divorced when it comes to thinking about what might be a problem,” Romanis says.She adds that, even in its earliest form, an artificial womb would confront parents with agonizing choices. This makes me think about Wendy, who wondered how a parent, driven by the desperate hope of saving their child, could understand the implications of placing their baby in a highly experimental device.On this point, such clinicians such as Christoph Haller, a cardiovascular surgeon in Toronto, describe artificial wombs as an opportunity for continuity rather than rupture. His team istesting their own prototype on fetal pigs. “The conversations with parents won’t be entirely new,” he says. “We already have to ask them to make impossible decisions: do we intubate, do we operate, do we stop? With any new technology, we’ll keep being honest about what we know and what we don’t.”But no one writes dystopian novels about IV drips or ventilators. With artificial wombs, the fantasy – and the fear – are built in.Would my husband and I even have used a surrogate if something like this had been available?That becomes clear when I return to the grief group a month after my first visit. Beth again raises the lamb photos. Joanne nods quickly. “I keep looking at them too. If that bag had been around, maybe I wouldn’t be sitting here. I’d have signed anything to get another few weeks.”Across the circle, a younger woman shakes her head sharply. “That’s just it. You wouldn’t have had a choice. They’d cram your baby in whether you wanted them to or not.” She won’t say whotheyare – politicians, doctors, hospitals – but the suspicion hangs heavy. “People already treat you like you’re selfish if you don’t do every single intervention. This would be one more thing they’d hold over you.”The man who lost his daughter during surrogacy clears his throat. “I can’t help wondering, would my husband and I even have used a surrogate if something like this had been available? Maybe the right thing would be to avoid putting another person at risk by asking them to carry a pregnancy.”The room vibrates with competing anxieties: that the technology will not arrive soon enough, and that it might arrive too fast. Here, the debates over biology versus technology, care versus coercion, compress into a small circle of folding chairs. And no matter where one falls on these questions, it would be naive to ignore their gravity.During our final meeting, Beth wears denim overalls speckled with talcum-colored paint. Strips of tape adorn the trim of an otherwise empty room. Beth grips a soaked brush bigger than her face, and the nursery walls around us are still wet enough to smell.“This is the last step,” she tells me.For months after her son died, Beth refused to enter the nursery she had built for him. Then, she joined the pregnancy grief group, where Wendy advised her to “take baby steps when packing up the room” (“No pun intended,” Beth says wearily).On her first attempt, Beth’s knees buckled just five steps beyond the doorway. “The room felt like a memorial for someone who had barely been alive,” she says. She tried again a week later, this time taking two stuffed animals when she left. Two days later, she came again.Item by item, Beth took apart the nursery. She numbed herself to the objects she removed: crocheted baby bootees; a half-completed scrapbook with maternity photos of Beth and her now ex-husband, palms tenderly pressed against her pregnant belly. She hired someone else to disassemble the crib.We talk about artificial wombs while she runs her brush over the nursery walls. The mural on the far wall – a hand-painted landscape of a mountain range – is the last to disappear. “If this technology existed, would I be a bad mom if I didn’t use it?” she wonders.Maha is backing this ‘natural’ infertility treatment. Is it the right’s path to limiting IVF?Read moreFor the scientists and doctors at the forefront of artificial womb technology, Beth’s fears might signal the dangers of letting science-fiction fantasies overshadow the tangible lifesaving benefits these technologies offer. But they may also reflect an indecision inherent to parenthood: the dread of making the wrong choice between what youcanandshoulddo for your child.If Beth’s son had been born 20 years later, he might have had a different brush with life. In one version of this alternate future, he grows in an artificial womb that saves his life. Beth fills her scrapbook with Polaroids of her baby, his toes snuggled into knitted bootees.In another version, Beth’s son is placed into an artificial womb: the doctors know he faces long odds and are willing to give him a fighting chance. Beth watches her baby grow in the tank and prays for a miracle. But the odds don’t tilt in his favor; the miracle does not materialize.Would Beth feel better, believing she had done everything she could to save him? Or would she for ever wonder whether her choices prolonged her son’s life, and his possible pain, for the same outcome?These are the considerations that underlie the overarching debate of how we should use artificial wombs when they become available. And if research labs and FDA committees are where resolutions to these questions are codified, then the choices of parents like Beth are where they are brought to life.“There aren’t any easy answers here for me, or for any parent,” Beth says. For now, she just keeps painting.Explore more on these topicsInfant and child mortalityParents and parentingFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

An Indian law graduate in her early 20s, she is in the earliest stages of her career and trying to build a public profile. The problem is, with AI-powered deepfakes on the rise, there is no longer any guarantee that the images she posts will not be distorted into something violating or grotesque.“The thought immediately pops in that, ‘OK, maybe it’s not safe. Maybe people can take our pictures and just do stuff with them,’” says Sarvaiya, who lives in Mumbai.“The chilling effect is true,” says Rohini Lakshané, a researcher on gender rights and digital policy based in Mysuru who also avoids posting photos of herself online. “The fact that they can be so easily misused makes me extra cautious.”The consequence of facing online harassment is silencing yourself or becoming less active onlineTarunima Prabhakar, TattleIn recent years, India has become one of the most important testing grounds for AI tools. It is theworld’s second-largest market for OpenAI, with the technologywidely adopted across professions.But areport released on Mondaythat draws on data collected by theRati Foundation, a charity running a countrywide helpline for victims of online abuse, shows that the rising adoption of AI has created a powerful new way to harass women.“It has become evident in the last three years that a vast majority of AI-generated content is used to target women and gender minorities,” says the report, authored by the Rati Foundation andTattle, a company that works to reduce misinformation on India’s social media.In particular, the report found an increase in AI tools being used to create digitally manipulated images or videos of women – either nudes or images that might be culturally appropriate in the US, but are stigmatising in many Indian communities, such as public displays of affection.View image in fullscreenThe Indian singer Asha Bhosle, left, and journalist Rana Ayyub, who have been affected by deepfake manipulation on social media.Photograph: GettyAbout 10% of the hundreds of cases reported to the helpline now involve these images, the report found. “AI makes the creation of realistic-looking content much easier,” it says.There have been high-profile cases of Indian women in the public sphere having their images manipulated by AI tools: for example, theBollywood singer Asha Bhosle, whose likeness and voice were cloned using AI and circulated on YouTube. Rana Ayyub, a journalist known for investigating political and police corruption, became the target of adoxingcampaign last year that led todeepfake sexualised imagesof her appearing on social media.These have led to a society-wide conversation, in which some figures, such as Bhosle, havesuccessfully fought for legal rights over their voice or image. Less discussed, however, is the effect that such cases have on ordinary women who, like Sarvaiya, feel increasingly uncertain about going online.“The consequence of facing online harassment is actually silencing yourself or becoming less active online,” says Tarunima Prabhakar, co-founder of Tattle. Her organisation used focus groups for two years across India to understand how digital abuse affected society.“The emotion that we have identified is fatigue,” she says. “And the consequence of that fatigue is also that you just completely recede from these online spaces.”For the past few years, Sarvaiya and her friends have followed high-profile cases of deepfake online abuse, such as Ayyub’s, or that of theBollywoodactor Rashmika Mandanna. “It’s a little scary for women here,” she says.Now, Sarvaiya hesitates to post anything on social media and has made her Instagram private. Even this, she worries, will not be enough to protect her: women are sometimes photographed in public spaces such as the metro, and thosepictures can later appear online.“It’s not as common as you would think it is, but you don’t know your luck, right?” she says. “Friends of friends are getting blackmailed – literally, off the internet.”Lakshané says she often asks not to be photographed at events now, even those where she is a speaker. But despite taking precautions, she is prepared for the possibility that a deepfake video or image of her might surface one day. On apps, she has made her profile picture an illustration of herself rather than a photo.“There is fear of misuse of images, especially for women who have a public presence, who have a voice online, who take political stands,” she says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In one instance it described, a woman approached the helpline after a photo she submitted with a loan application was used to extort money from her.“When she refused to continue with the payments, her uploaded photograph was digitally altered using a nudify app and placed on a pornographic image,” the report says.That photograph, with her phone number attached, was circulated on WhatsApp, resulting in a “barrage of sexually explicit calls and messages from unknown individuals”. The woman told Rati’s helpline that she felt “shamed and socially marked, as though she had been ‘involved in something dirty’”.View image in fullscreenA fake video ostensibly showing Rahul Gandhi, the Indian National Congress leader, and India’s finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, promoting a financial scheme.Photograph: DAU SecretariatIn India, as in most of the world, deepfakes operate in a legal grey zone –no specific laws recognise themas distinct forms of harm, although Rati’s report outlines several Indian laws that could apply to online harassment and intimidation, under which women can report AI deepfakes.“But that process is very long,” says Sarvaiya, who has argued that India’s legal system remains ill equipped to deal with AI deepfakes. “And it has a lot of red tape to just get to that point to get justice for what has been done.”Part of the responsibility lies with the platforms on which these images are shared – often YouTube, Meta, X, Instagram and WhatsApp. Indian law enforcement agencies describe the process of getting these companies to remove abusive content as “opaque, resource-intensive, inconsistent and often ineffective”, according to areport released on Tuesday by Equality Now, which campaigns for women’s rights.WhileAppleandMeta have recently taken stepsto limit the spread of nudify apps, Rati’s report notes several instances in which these platforms responded inadequately to online abuse.WhatsApp eventually took action in the extortion case but its response was “insufficient”, Rati reported, as the nudes were already all over the internet. In another case, where an IndianInstagramcreator was harassed by a troll posting nude videos of them, Instagram only responded after “sustained effort”, with a response that was “delayed and inadequate”.Tech bros need to realise deepfake porn ruins lives – and the law has to catch upRead moreVictims were often ignored when they reported harassment to these platforms, the report says, which led them to approach the helpline. Furthermore, even if a platform removed an account spreading abusive content, that content often reappeared elsewhere, in what Rati calls “content recidivism”.“One of the abiding characteristics of AI-generated abuse is its tendency to multiply. It is created easily, shared widely and tends to resurface repeatedly,” Rati says. Addressing it “will require far greater transparency and data access from platforms themselves”.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentArtificial intelligence (AI)DeepfakeIndiaWomen's rights and gender equalitySouth and central AsiaComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The regulator recommended that Facebook and its parent company,Meta, took measures to ensure adverts were non-discriminatory, giving the company three months to inform the French body of the measures.In its ruling, which is not legally binding, the regulator said the “system implemented for disseminating job offers treats users of the Facebook platform differently based on their sex and constitutes indirect discrimination related to sex”.The watchdog’s decision came after Global Witness, a campaign group whose remit includes investigating big tech’s impact on human rights, posted adverts on Facebook containing links to a range of jobs in countries includingFrance, the UK, Ireland and South Africa.The study found that in France specifically nine out of 10 people shown an advert for mechanic vacancies were male, while the same proportion of recipients of ads for preschool teachers were female. Eight out of 10 people who saw ads for psychologist positions were women, while seven out of 10 ads for pilots were viewed by men.Global Witness, together with French women’s rights organisations the Foundation for Women (La Fondation des Femmes) and Women Engineers (Femmes Ingénieurs), which had complained to the rights body, welcomed the ruling.“This appears to be the first time a European regulator has decided that a social media platform’s algorithm discriminates by gender, presenting a major step forward in holding these platforms accountable to existing law,” they said in a joint statement.Josephine Shefet, a lawyer representing the complainants, said: “The decision sends a strong message to all digital platforms: They will be held accountable for such bias. The legal principle establishes an important precedent for future cases.”Meta rejected the ruling. “We disagree with this decision and are assessing our options,” a spokesperson said.In 2022, Meta agreed tochange Facebook’s algorithmsafter the US Department of Justice alleged the platform’s housing advertising system discriminated against users based on characteristics including race, religion and sex.Explore more on these topicsFranceFacebookMetaAdvertisingEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Over the past five years, developer Epic Games maintained the relevance and awareness of its ageing online shooter by churning out pop culture collaborations, from Marvel to John Wick to Sabrina Carpenter. For limited periods, players get to take part in the game as their favourite movie characters and music artists, an arrangement that provides refreshed audience numbers for the game – and a tidy revenue stream for the brands.Now it’s the turn ofThe Simpsons. This month, the Fortnite island has become a miniature Springfield, complete with popular characters and well-known locations. If you want to play as Homer and shoot up Moe’s Tavern, you can. If you want to take Bart to Kwik-E-Mart for a squishee, go ahead. Everywhere you look there’s a fun little Simpsons Easter egg, from the fact that the Battlebus (which delivers players on to the island) is now driven by Otis to the presence of Duffman, Seymour Skinner’s steamed hams and drooling aliens.But the Fortnite tie-in is only the latest example of a longstanding and symbiotic relationship between The Simpsons and video games. In 1991, less than two years after the show’s debut, Acclaim released Bart vs The Space Mutants, a side-scrolling platformer in which Bart must defeat an extraterrestrial invasion by doing frustrating pixel-perfect jumps and fighting bosses including Nelson and Sideshow Bob, while “enjoying” a scratchy sound sample of “eat my shorts” over and over again.Despite mediocre reviews, the game sold 1m copies, and inspired a rash of Bart-focused games such as Bart vs The World and Bart’s House of Weirdness. This interplay made perfect sense; Bart is, of course, a huge video game fan, and in the early days of the show, when he was the focal point of the writing, he represented the target demographic of the contemporary games industry: a mischievous 10-year-old boy with an interest in comical violence.The relationship would come to the fore in the classic 1995 Christmas episode Marge Be Not Proud in which Bart watches a TV ad for a hyper-violent hack-’em-up named Bonestorm.(The commercialhas a muscular Santa bursting into a family living room holding a rocket launcher and yelling: “Tell your folks, buy me Bonestorm or go to hell!”) It’s a clear parody of the frenzied, super-targeted marketing behind 1992’s Mortal Kombat, a game Bart would have relished thanks to its array of decapitations and eviscerations. At the end of the episode, Bart gets a video game for Christmas, but it’s the joyously sedate Lee Carvallo’s Putting Challenge. It’s funny, but it is also symbolic of the console war at the time: the rebellious Sega Mega Drive v the family-friendly Nintendo Entertainment System.View image in fullscreenEat my shorts … The Simpsons Bart vs The World for the NES.Photograph: Arcade Images/AlamyThe best early Simpsons game would arrive a few months after Bart vs Space Mutants. Konami’s 1992 arcade hit, The Simpsons, is an excellent four-player brawler in which the family is pitted against Mr Burns – who has, in a daft plot that is just an excuse to visit a lot of Springfield locations and attack enemies with skateboards and vacuum cleaners – kidnapped Maggie. My favourite example from the 1990s, though, was the 1996 PC release The Simpsons Cartoon Studio, which gave players a range of locations, characters and soundbites from the show in order to create their own mini Simpsons cartoons – a little foretaste of the TikTok memes Fortnite Simpsons fans are bound to make and share.Meanwhile, the show itself has kept finding new ways to gently satirise video games. Springfield’s regularly featured arcade Noiseland is crammed with amusing coin-operated games from Jane Fonda’s Legwarmers of Death to the wonderful My Dinner With André from season five’s Boy-Scoutz ’n the Hood (press up on the joystick to offer “Trenchant Insight”). But games are also used as a useful pop cultural tool for poking fun at the characters themselves. The favourite game of the godly Flanders kids is Billy Graham’s Bible Blaster, an evangelical preach-’em-up that has Rod Flanders shouting, “Keep firing; convert the heathens!”View image in fullscreenHey, hey kids … The Simpsons: Hit and Run.Photograph: Arcade Images/AlamyHowever, the Simpsons video game that probably best foreshadows the Fortnite tie-in is 2003’s much-loved Simpsons Hit & Run, a glorious Homer-fronted pastiche of Grand Theft Auto. Here you can drive around town visiting Android’s Dungeon, Krusty Burger and the Legitimate Businessman’s Social Club, while carrying out missions to prevent another alien plot. This was, to be honest, the last great Simpsons title, and it’s interesting how a lot ofthe games press coverageof the Fortnite tie-in is essentially: “I’d rather have Hit & Run 2, but I guess this will do.”What the collaboration really shows is how The Simpsons has continued to survive as a cultural icon, despite its decline as a must-watch TV phenomenon. The heady combination of slapstick, parody and social commentary aligns with the scrambled self-aware narratives of video games, where crazed violence often intercuts with gooey sentimentality and knockabout laughs. Both The Simpsons and video games came of age in the early 1990s, a hyperactive postmodern theme park of an era, and they have both continued to explore and exploit the worst excesses of our consumer society. Fortnite might not be the place we wanted to find a proper modern Simpsons game, but it makes sense for it to be here – a palace of memes, soundbites and cartoonish antics that will no doubt continue to generate fun and money for many years to come.What to playView image in fullscreenA work of great evil … Ball x Pit.Photograph: Kenny Sun/Devolver DigitalDespite how much I am enjoying it, I believe thatBall x Pitmay be a work of great evil. A concerningly potent combination of Space Invaders, Vampire Survivors and old ball-bouncing action games such as Breakout, it is a dungeon-delving arcade game in which you fire balls at lines of descending skeleton hordes as you descend down a bottomless pit. The balls bounce off enemies, or burn them, poison them, pass through them; every wave of defeated creatures unlocks a new suite of perks and bonuses and upgrades for you to combine. Above ground, you build a base for your characters and ping them about to harvest wood and stone to build yet more. The screen is always visually cacophonous, crowded with mesmerising waves of creatures and spells and bouncing balls. Most of the time I feel as if it’s playing itself. But still: it’s just so absorbing.Keza MacDonaldAvailable on:Nintendo Switch, PS5, Xbox, PC, MacEstimated playtime:Possibly forever, in 15-20 minute burstsWhat to readView image in fullscreen‘Blatant’ … Grand Theft Auto VI by Rockstar, which has been accused of union-busting.Photograph: Rockstar gamesThe Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, which represents a huge variety of gig economy workers including those on contracts at video game studios,has accusedGrand Theft Auto VI producerRockstar Gamesof “the most blatant and ruthless act of union-busting in the history of the games industry”.

Is it, perhaps, that coming up with interesting games that don’t involve fighting is too difficult?Not all games are violent, but all the big-budget games seem to be.”This is a much-discussed question among game designers and thinkers. Since Space Invaders, video games have presented players with an enemy to defeat: without competition and combat and adrenaline, how do you make it fun? Some see conflict as a driving force behind most stories, an almost inevitable part of game design. Others view video game violence as a failure of imagination.OnGamesindustry.bizin 2017, the game designer Brie Code posited that most games were geared towards inducing a fight-or-flight stress response in the player, and wrote about how games might move towards a different modality: tend-and-befriend. “What is game design missing? I ask this question in terms of game mechanics and game systems. I ask in terms of adrenaline, dopamine, oxytocin, opioids, and other reward systems. I ask in terms of gameplay, that helps a wider range of people understand themselves and their responses to stress and to the world.”I am also reminded of aGame Developer essayby Brian Fairbanks. “Life is complicated, messy, stressful and painful. Our problems take so many forms, and our chosen entertainment takes those problems, distills them into a single entity and puts a Foe badge on them,” he wrote. “The issue here is, in nonviolent games, we don’t have access to that power in the same way. Our games are structured so that the challenge and progression does not revolve around literally destroying your problems with weapons. We have to find other ways to get there.”By the way, there are a great many non-violent games around. Some of them, such as Animal Crossing, certainly count as blockbusters. There’s no comprehensive database off them, butThinkyGamesis the closest (you can filter out action, combat and timing), and there’s also an activenon-violent entertainmentcuration page onSteam. For family friendly, violence-free games,Common Sense Mediais a good resource.KMIf you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter –email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterFortniteThe SimpsonsAnimation on TVTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No, some will say. Probably people who have never played the original and don’t understand the appeal, but like to tilt their head with a mixture of bemusement and condescension and say: “So what do youdoin the game? Just wash things?”(It feels unfair that other pastimes don’t have to justify themselves like this. No one ever says, “Wait, you just run around the park in a circle for five kilometres?” Or, “So you just kick the ball with your foot?”)Yes, is the short answer. You point your hose at whatever mucky thing is in front of you – a bungalow, a monster truck, Lara Croft’s mansion – and blast all that filth into oblivion. Each time you finish a section, a pleasing ”ding” rings out, triggering your brain to release a little bit more dopamine. This is the only sound in the game, save for the rush of water and the occasional clang of a metal ladder. The whole experience is intensely soothing, deeply satisfying, and mesmerising. I love it.I love it so much that in 2023 I played PowerWash Simulator for 24 hours, 6 minutes and 33 seconds, live on streaming service Twitch –setting the Guinness World Recordfor the longest time spent playing the game.View image in fullscreenWash this … PowerWash Simulator 2.Photograph: FuturLabI would not recommend it. As enjoyable as the game is, the shine does start to wear off after about… 20 hours. I remember things started to get weird around 4am. The bright primary colours of the children’s playground I was cleaning began swirling together in a psychedelic frenzy. My vision was blurring, my fingers were aching, and I was overcome by a burning rage at the local council for allowing the climbing frame to get into this state.I pushed through with the support of myTwitchcommunity, who encouraged me to keep going and reminded me that a reality outside the game did exist. But I had flashbacks for months afterwards. Sometimes, lying in bed at night, I was convinced I could still hear the endless hiss of the jet spray, and would worry I’d given myself tinnitus. To this day I find it difficult to walk past a slide without checking the underside for mildew.Funnily enough, I didn’t feel like playing PowerWash Simulator for a while after the record-setting session. But it has been a joy to pick up the sequel and rediscover the sense of achievement that only comes from obliterating the final speck of encrusted faecal matter from a chrome toilet bowl. Bliss.It helps that this instalment feels a touch more forgiving when it comes to cleaning every last atom of dirt. There is also a new target icon directing you to bits you’ve missed, which makes finishing missions less frustrating.And of course there are new things to wash. PowerWash Simulator 2 features 38 missions in total, including an airship, a mobility scooter and a shopping mall. New gadgets include a surface cleaner for more efficient floor polishing, and a harness system so you can abseil down buildings. There’s a wider selection of soaps and nozzles, plus a new home base where you can display evidence of your achievements. This is particularly appealing if you’re the kind of person who has hung their (three) Guinness World Record certificates in the hallway so they’re the first thing the DPD driver sees when you open your front door.None of this adds up to a radical departure from the original game. Nor is the sequel likely to win over people who couldn’t see the point the first time around. But PowerWash Simulator 2gives the fans what they want: new things to wash, extra toys to play with, further unchallenging yet satisfying gameplay. Plus the option to occasionally draw a crude representation of male genitalia in the dirt for lols. With all the madness going on out there, this is exactly the game the world needs right now.PowerWash Simulator 2 is available now; £19.99/$24.99Explore more on these topicsGamesPCNintendo Switch 2TwitchSimulation gamescommentShareReuse this content"

At a grassroots level, amidplungingpoll ratings, there has been a yearning for renewal and a more punchy, combative approach in opposition. Against that bleak backdrop, the remarkableelectionof Zohran Mamdani to the New York City mayoralty is a moment for progressives to savour.Mr Mamdani entered the mayoral race last October as a socialist outsider with almost zero name recognition. He won it with more than 50% of the vote after the highest turnout in more than half a century, and despite the best efforts ofbillionairesto bankroll his chief rival, the former New York governor Andrew Cuomo, to victory. That achievement makes him the youngest mayor of the US’s largest city for more than 100 years and the first Muslim to occupy the role.New York is a traditional Democratic stronghold and is in no sense a national bellwether. Nevertheless, faced with a Maga movement that has based its success on the support of working-class voters, the Democratic party can learn much from Mr Mamdani’s extraordinary triumph. Leaving culture-war politics to his increasinglydesperateopponents, he campaigned relentlessly and almost exclusively on the theme of affordability.Charges of ideological extremism failed to stick becausepledgesof free childcare, free buses and a rent freeze spoke to an essentially social democratic message, offering public solutions to years of rising inequality. That vision persuaded a vast army of 100,000 volunteer canvassers to knock on millions of doors, more than offsetting Mr Cuomo’s far greater financial resources. The central insight was that values-driven opposition to Maga populism can succeed when supplemented by a positive offer to voters whose living standards have been steadily eroded.On an uplifting night for Democrats, a similar pattern was seen in New Jersey and Virginia, where more centrist-leaning candidateswongubernatorial races by impressive margins. Cost-of-living pledges were again to the fore, including a proposed freeze on electricity prices and a focus on housing costs. California offered further grounds for a cautious rebirth of optimism; after Republican gerrymandering of congressional boundaries in Texas, voters backed countermeasures to redress the balance ahead of next year’s midterm elections.As the Democratic party journeys through the wilderness of a second Trump term, it would be fanciful to believe that a corner has been definitively turned. For New York’s mayor-elect, the hard yards are yet to begin. Mr Trump has alreadythreatenedto withhold federal funds from an administration he will do his utmost to discredit, undermine and disrupt. More broadly, the reluctance of senior Democratic figures to endorse Mr Mamdani’s campaign confirms that internal divisions over strategy are a long way from being resolved.However, it would be churlish to ignore green shoots of political recovery when they appear. As Mr Trump’s popularitysinksamid ongoing cost-of-living concerns and high inflation, the hollowness of Maga pledges to improve blue-collar living standards is a major zone of vulnerability. An emerging focus on affordability anchors Democrats in the preoccupations of their lost voters, as well as those who have remained loyal. By campaigning on that basis with elan and conviction, Mr Mamdani has blazed an inspiring trail.Explore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniOpinionDemocratsUS politicsAndrew CuomoDonald TrumpNew YorkeditorialsShareReuse this content"

He came to socialism through watching Bernie Sanders run for the US presidency in 2016, in the contest that ultimately gave us Trump I. Last November, a few days after the election of Trump II, he asked voters why they’d backedthat guy. The conversations prepared Mamdani in his battle for New York, and thefilm of themreveals so much about the politics of this era that it repays watching.Those of us schooled in the tactics of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair might roll our eyes at yet another “listening exercise”, starring a powerbroker and his retinue in some beautifully lit hall, but this is no such thing. Here stands an unknown on a street corner in the Bronx, waving a placard as doughtily as a Seventh-Day Adventist. Rather than read off a Rolodex of platitudes, this politician sees his public – some of whom look a little like him, yet whose faces and bodies are etched with the strains of the city. Never having spoken to power, even a lowly state assemblyman such as Mamdani, they talk of lives made smaller and shorter in an economy where the daily basics are too costly. Politics has failed them, so they consider politicians to be failures.Such frustrations propelled Trump into the White House. This week they made Mamdani mayor of the US’s largest city. Analysts have often put the two side by side, only to utter banalities about how they are both good on TikTok or – that giveaway from pundits striving to earn their keep – “populist”. Yet the comparison carries far higher stakes.Both New Yorkers, they embody opposite sides of the metropolis: Manhattan versus its suburbs ; towers versus the streets. They also represent alternative paths for the US. Trump leads his country towards ethnonationalism and Darwinian economics; Mamdani stands for immigrants and a city affordable for all. Crucially, he understands the urban working class is not just white, but often black and brown. It is only through an understanding of the grave dangers posed by Trump that you can glean the hopes vested in Mamdani.A few examples: in September, Trump’s guardsgrabbed Korean engineers, who had their papers in order, from a Hyundai factory to force them out of the country and thousands of miles away. Last month, ICE agentsabducted a British journalisttravelling the US on a valid visa for criticising the brutalities committed by Israel. Last week, only hours before 42 million low-income Americans lost theiraccess to food aid, the president hosted aGreat Gatsby-themed bash, featuring a scantily clad woman in a giant martini glass. The fete was titled: “A little party never killed nobody.”Such guffawing, lethal thuggishness is why other cities are so enlivened by a contest of otherwise glancing importance to their own lives. Even in a globalised social media, the question of who heads five boroughs on the eastern seaboard of the US does not usually command transnational significance. In the country, the centre of financial power is shifting from east coast to west, from Atlantic to Pacific, Wall Street to Silicon Valley. Nor does the new boy’s crowd appeal derive solely from his youth and charm, or even his recognition of theenduring greatnessof the Wu-Tang Clan – although none of those hurt.Still, the chief reason Mamdani has aroused such keen interest is because he is the first leftwinger to show that politicians can not only face down Trumpism, they can beat him. That is the defining task of our era, as New York’s new mayor knows. Amid the thank-yous oflast night’s victory speech, he declared: “If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him.”Over the past year of Trump II, the finest talents on the centre-left have been stumped how to respond. Obama? Almost nothing. Kamala Harris? Writing her memoirs, of course. The fiercest hostility to Mamdani has come from those supposed to be on his side. After losing in the primary,serial sex pestAndrew Cuomo ran as an independent – and campaigned as Trump’s pick in this week’s contest. The man who is today the first Muslim to lead New York has faced constant innuendo that he is a terrorist sympathiser.Across Europe, the prefects of social democracy have kowtowed to the US’s extremist-in-chief. Keir Starmer treated him to anunprecedented second state visit, while Nato chief Mark Rutte hascalled him“daddy”. Five years ago, US media moguls took the knee to show off their commitment to diversity; now they bend the knee to a racist loudmouth. Columnists and podcasters talk utter sausage about a “vibe shift” in US politics, even whiletwo days of mass ralliesagainst Trumpism drew something like 12 million people.The centre-left should be taking on the extreme right and acting as the anti-Trump. Instead, as Fintan O’Toole writes in the latest New York Review of Books, it isplaying at being not-Trump. Or: not-Farage, not-Weidel, not-Le Pen. In the UK, Starmer’s pitch is basically: we’ll adopt the language and the flags, but deploy them with greater civility. As a response to this moment, it is morally contemptible and politically myopic.In his fine new book The Great Global Transformation, the former World Bank economist Branko Milanovic describes how our political and economic order is now coming to an end. China and the global south now account for more of the world economy than the US, Japan, Europe and the many others put together that he terms the “capitalist core”; at the same time, capitalism is being redefined. The elites who prospered under the regimes shaped by Reagan and Thatcher are now redefining their nations into narrower, meaner, harsher societies, ditching the old commitments to multiculturalism and equality for women. They are forcing upon the rest of us capitalism without secure contracts, unions or even the HR department.Hold Milanovic’s lens over Trump and what do you see? Not an all-powerful emperor, nor some scheming bureaucrat like Putin – but the US’s Yeltsin. He is the buffoon presiding over his country’s decline in influence and importance, while behind him in the shadows the oligarchs carve up the spoils. And if democracy proves too troublesome, why, they’ll buy it. One of the biggest players in the New York elections was hedge-fund guy Bill Ackman, whooffered to bankrollanyone who could bring down Mamdani.In the 90s and 00s, the centre-left’s response to Reagan and Thatcher was Clinton, Blair and the third way. They compromised with the new money and triangulated their electoral bases – and they held power, for a while.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Climate chaos does not come with a moderate option. An oligarch is not interested in your pitiful attempts to strike a deal. To see the logical endpoint of the new left’s embrace of money, look no further than Peter Mandelson. Famous for being “intensely relaxed” about people getting filthy rich, he became especially relaxed in the company of the filthy rich, such as money man and child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein – and is now discovering anew the meaning of “disgraced”.The old foxholes and get-out clauses, abstractions and moist eyes, won’t work for the left now. Voters don’t talk about inequality; they worry about paying the bills and getting by. The young aren’t mollified by talk of “suffering” in Gaza; they want it stopped. And bang opposite, the right are bending politics and economics to their will.You can see the past year between Trump’s election and Mamdani’s as real-time dialectic. Thesis, antithesis; right hook, southpaw. It is foolish to pretend that there is any equivalence of power between the White House and Gracie Mansion, but at least the left is still in the fight.Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Despite all the odds, a 34-year-old Muslim Democratic socialist has been elected to lead the largest city in the United States. Zohran Mamdani’s win is a huge victory for all New Yorkers, but it is also meaningful far beyond the five boroughs of this city.Just as amazing was that this election wasn’t even close. Mamdani’s main opponent, formerNew Yorkgovernor Andrew Cuomo, ran a campaign that was as devoid of imagination as it was of hope and even personality. Having dramatically lost the democratic primary this past summer, Cuomo was forced to run as an independent, an almost comical political affiliation for a man whose campaign was utterly dependent on donations from the billionaire class.Mamdani’s run was completely different.Fundedoverwhelmingly by donations under $100 and fueled substantially more by human capital than greenbacks – over 100,000 peoplevolunteeredfor the campaign – Mamdani’s campaign mobilized a level of civic participation in local politics that I have never witnessed in the more than three decades I’ve lived in this city.The chattering classes of American media mostly ignored this hard and dedicated work by largely faceless volunteers, wanting instead to focus on all the wrong reasons for his win. He’s charismatic and good looking, theysaid(though Trump, of course, believesheis better looking). He’s winning because he’sgoodat social media. He’s successful because his supporters arelonelypeople.If only it were that easy. The real reason Mamdani has won is that he is the candidate who best understood what the people of New York want and need at this moment. He took the debilitating amount of economic anxiety that so many Americans are suffering through right now and turned it into a message of economic justice, believing that we all should be able to afford to live in the city we call home. He took the political anxiety that so many of us feel right now, as authoritarianism emanates from Washington DC, and turned it into New York pride for its legendary rambunctious spirit. (“To get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us,” he said during his victory speech.”)He refused to compromise on the rights of the Palestinian people to live in dignity. The last one is particularly significant. The old guard has long believed that expressions for Palestinian rights were equivalent to an electoral kiss of death. For the last year, they have predicted his downfall for this reason alone almost daily. Now, he has proved every single one of them wrong.From the beginning of Mamdani’s rise in this election, it was clear that none of the old political logic was working. Regardless, his opponents continued to believe that his defeat must be premised on their own appeals to the vilest racism. Queens Republican Vickie Paladino, a New York City council member,demandedMamdani be deported, and she questioned if he had been a citizen long enough to be elected mayor. During a radio interview, Cuomolaughedwhen the host claimed that Mamdani would “be cheering” another 9/11. “That’s another problem,” the former governor responded. Then, the day before the election, a political action committee supporting Cuomorana disgusting ad with Mamdani in front of video of the twin towers crashing down on 9/11.The real lesson of the election, however, is that this noxious racism didn’t work. “No more will New York be a city where you can traffic in Islamophobia and win an election,” Mamdani said in his victory speech.That doesn’t mean that Islamophobia has been summarily defeated, any more than it means that economic injustice has been ultimately vanquished. Years from now, this electoral victory will be seen as the easy part. The real work, as we all know, lies ahead.But what’s unique about this victory is that the Mamdani campaign has mobilized so many people locally to fight the good fight. The possibilities are as necessary as they are exciting. The election, both in its campaign and its results, have shown that the citizens of New York City are ready to actively forge a better future for all and together as one. The future is local.It’s no surprise that the Mamdani campaign hasresonatedso loudly across the world. In a time when rightwing authoritarianism is rising dangerously and globally, Mamdani’s win is an object lesson in how left, local, and participatory politics can win. During his victory speech, the now incoming mayor expressed the kernel of this truth, and he did so in Arabic, the first time I can remember hearing this routinely vilified language in a politician’s acceptance speech in the United States.To me, this is not just a simplistic politics of recognition. On the contrary. What Mamdani said points to how this message will travel from New York to Marseille to Berlin and beyond. It may be the key to our survival at this moment, and we should all listen to it carefully. “Ana minkum wa ilaikum,” he said, which means: “I am of you and for you.”Now, we hold him to those words, and we hold ourselves to them as well.Moustafa Bayoumi is Guardian US coolumnistExplore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniOpinionNew YorkUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But as a former Democrat, what does she really think of the political world she’s landed in?Wed 5 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 06.33 ESTShareUsha Vance is a very clever woman with terrible taste in men. The Yale and Cambridge-educated lawyerquit her jobat a prestigious DC firm the same day her husband was picked to be Donald Trump’s running mate. She trailed after him on the campaign trail, smiling for the cameras. A former Democrat, she aligned herself with Trump, a man her husband once called “America’s Hitler”.In exchange for her loyalty, the second lady now has a taxpayer-fundedmansion,regulartrips in a private jet, and a husband who acknowledges white supremacist attacks on her – saying “Don’t attack my wife” – but has failed to condemn them head on. Speaking during an event at the University of Mississippi last Wednesday, the vice-president said that he hoped his wife, raised in a Hindu household, wouldconvert to Christianity. JD, by the way, used to be an atheist, then converted to Catholicism in 2019,saying he“really liked that the Catholic church was just really old”.JD’s comments about Usha’s Hinduism received a lot of backlash, including from a rightwing Canadiancommentatorwho posted (then deleted): “it’s weird to throw your wife’s religion under the bus, in public, for a moment’s acceptance by groypers.” (That’s a name for those who followfar-right white supremacist and antisemite Nick Fuentes.) In a reply, the vice-presidentcalled thiscomment “disgusting … anti-Christian bigotry”. You know what seems disgusting, JD: saying that you hope the woman you married in a Christian-Hindu ceremony abandons something apparently important to her.Usha Vance is no victim. She’s ambitious and a major force in JD’smeteoric rise. She’s just as implicated in America’s slide towards autocracy and embrace of bigotry as he is. Still, you have to wonder if she has moments of doubt. Especially as she hasn’t fully Maga-fied herself yet: unlike many in Trump’s orbit, she hasn’t succumbed to the conspicuous cosmetic surgery known asMar-a-Lago face. In an interview withThe Free Pressin April she said she has no plans to dye her naturally greying hair. “People don’t seem to care all that much what I look like,” she said. I’ll tell you what you look like to me, Usha: a woman happy to trade her dignity for power.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist and the author of Strong Female LeadDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Sometimes outright censorship isn’t even required to achieve this goal. In the United States, we have seen the administration apply various forms of pressure on news outlets in the year since Trump’s election. One of my great disappointments is how quickly some of the most storied US media organizations have folded when faced with the mere specter of hostility from the administration – long before their hand was forced.Mostly, this has not been the doing of journalists or editors, but that of billionaire proprietors and corporate brassputting their private interests above the public good. Worryingly, we nowseem to be moving into a new phase, with top editorial roles being filled with appointees seen as more palatable to the White House, andreporters’ accessto public informationbeing restricted.While private news organizations can choose how to respond to this government’s threats, insults and lawsuits, public media has been powerless to stop the defunding of federally supported television and radio. This has beendevastating for local and rural communities, who stand to lose not only their primary source of local news and cultural programming, but health and public safety information, including emergency alerts.While we cannot make up for this loss, we at the Guardian are proud to make our fact-based work available for free to all, especially when the internet is increasingly flooded with slanted reporting, misinformation and algorithmic drivel.The gutting of public media makes it even more crucial for private outlets to choose what is right over what is financially and politically expedient. As we promised you during the election, our coverage refuses to treat politics as a game, and we decline to participate in the normalization of extremism. For us, it is not enough merely to state what this administration is doing; it’s only when we broaden our perspective – looking backward to history and beyond our borders to the rest of the world – that we see clearly theominous patterns appearing herethat have characterized transitions to autocracy elsewhere, and thescale of the threatsfacing US democracy.Politically motivatedprosecutions are already being used not only topunish dissent, but to discourage others from speaking out. One of the most chilling things our newsroom has witnessed in the past year is sources falling silent, afraid of retribution.Wealreadyknowthe threatsare working.Being free from billionaire and corporate ownership means the Guardian will never compromise our independence – but it also means we rely on support from readers who understand how essential it is to have news sources that are immune to intimidation from the powerful.I know our requests for support are not as welcome as our reporting, but without them, it’s simple: our reporting wouldn’t exist. And as I look around the US media landscape a year on from the election, I am especially thankful to be where I am: I would much rather write this column asking for your support than be behind closed doors, pleading with a corporate executive not to cave to government pressure and forfeit our editorial independence.Of course, we understand that some readers are not in a position to support us, and if that is you, we value your readership no less.But if you are able,please support us today. At this critical moment, the survival of our democracy depends on organizations and institutions with power and resources having the courage and the ability to hold the line. For the Guardian’s part, I can promise you this: whatever they throw at us next year, we’ll never back down from reporting the truth, and we’ll never quit.You can support the Guardian’s year-end appeal here.All gifts are gratefully received, but a recurring contribution – even a small monthly amount – is most impactful, helping sustain our work throughout the year ahead.

Zohran Mamdani is the opposite of thisWed 5 Nov 2025 00.30 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 12.39 ESTShareReports of the death of the Democratic party seem to have been greatly exaggerated. On Tuesday night,Zohran Mamdani, the 34-year-old political novice who won New Yorkers over with an affable demeanor that seemed to take infectious joy in the people of the city and a relentlessly focused message of affordability, swept to the mayoralty of the US’s largest city with a commanding lead.In so doing, Mamdani defeated what has been, since 2010’s Citizen’s United decision unleashing unlimited money into American political campaigns, one of the most indefatigable forces in electoral politics: the preferences of billionaires. And it wasn’t close – Mamdani trounced his billionaire-backed opponent by nearly nine points.Mamdani had faced down a robust funding campaign by the nation’s ultra-rich in favor of his opponent, Andrew Cuomo, the disgraced former New York governor who ran as an independent in the mayoral race after Mamdani defeated him in a landslide upset victory this past summer. (The Republican ballot line featured Curtis Sliwa, a perennial mayoral candidate and New York City eccentric who was not a real contender in the race.) Billionaires, perturbed by Mamdani’s avowed socialist politics, his proposals for expanded social services like universal childcare, and his declarations that billionaires should not exist, hadbacked Cuomowith a fervor that at times bordered on mania.Bill Ackman, the hedge fund manager and prominent Trump supporter, gave a pro-Cuomo group a total of $1.75m; Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire and three-term formerNew Yorkmayor, donated a staggering $8.3m to the same Pac. The makeup moguls of the Lauder family backed pro-Cuomo and anti-Mamdani organizations to the tune of $2.6m, while the Tisch family gave $1.2m to stop the young socialist. For a long time, an effort – the billionaire class acting in concert to secure a specific electoral outcome – would have seemed insurmountable for a progressive candidate. It does not seem insurmountable anymore.Mamdani’s victory, above all, is a rebuke to the conventional strategies of the Democratic party, which in the year since Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election had been in a state of malaise and decline. Democratic congressional leadership seems to have replaced the work of politics with a sort of learned helplessness; alumni of the Biden administration are publishing dueling memoirs blaming everyone but themselves.Meanwhile, consultants – long the devil on the Democratic party’s shoulder – have fallen under the spell of “popularism”, a mode of politics advanced by pollsters like David Schor and bloggers like Matt Yglesias, which posits that Democratic candidates must refine their platforms by the median of public opinion; a prescription that has almost always, in practice, meant shifting right, abandoning vulnerable constituencies, and treating the public as implacable belligerents to be coddled, rather than as intelligent adults to be persuaded.It is not only pragmatism, but cynicism, and no small degree of fear, that has led to the widespread adaptation of this approach: the rapidly proliferating number of centrist and center-right thinktanks and consultancies looking to shape Democratic party strategy exist, in part, to channel the preferences of their own ultra-wealthy funders, and to signal what the billionaire class will accept. The result is a Democratic party that appears listless and unprincipled, unwilling to fight because they do not believe in anything.Mamdani’s electrifying campaign rejected this strategy completely. Rather than define himself by what he wasn’t, via the conventional path of left punching, shifting rightward, and abandoning in the general election stances that he had taken in the primary, Mamdani ran on a remarkably consistent message of the injustice of economic inequality and an insistence on the possibility that the city could become a place where working people could live with dignity.When Cuomo and his backers launched racist attacks suggesting that Mamdani, an Ugandan-born South Asian Muslim, wouldcelebrate terrorism, he responded by cutting an ad in Arabic. When Republicans and other Cuomo backers tried pushing a red-baiting line promoting fear of Mamdani’s socialism, he evoked Vito Marcantonio, a socialist who represented Harlem in Congress for seven terms. “We need to look only to our past for proof of how socialism can shape our future,” he said. In a record turnout election, a majority of the people of New York City agreed with him.The Democratic party leadership, it should be said, does not. Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic leader whose Bed-Stuy district overwhelmingly went for Mamdani, did not endorse the young socialist after he won the Democratic primary, giving only tepid, reluctant support in the days immediately before the election.The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, whose Grand Army Plaza home is also located in a significantly pro-Mamdani section of Brooklyn, did not endorse the Democratic nominee for the mayor of his home city at all, andrefused to saywho he voted for in the election – a conspicuous omission that led some to speculate that he had voted for Cuomo.With the notable exception of Barack Obama, who reportedly recently called Mamdani to express admiration for the younger man’s campaign, the attitude among national Democrats towards Mamdani’s victory seems to linger somewhere between distaste and alarm. They do not like his progressive politics, certainly; they are perhaps not comfortable with a rising star in their party being a Muslim, immigrant man of color, perhaps. Or maybe they are embittered and resentful that where their calculated, cynical, focus-grouped campaign strategy of insincerity and manipulation has failed, Mamdani’s unabashedly sincere campaign of joy and principle has succeeded.There is a long way to go for Mamdani. Having won the mayoralty and vanquished one of New York’s most hated and longstanding political dynasties, he now faces the true test: having to govern. This, too, might scare the Democratic establishment: not because Mamdani could fail, but because he could succeed. Perhaps the only thing they would hate more than bad socialist government, one suspects, is good socialist government.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniOpinionNew YorkcommentShareReuse this content"

This much is beyond dispute: Mamdani represents the immediate future of New York City, America’s largest town and the financial capital of the world.His win, just as indisputably, is a historic victory for the American left, which has been buoyed in spirit and resolve since Mamdani’s underdog victory in the mayoral primary. InNew York, it will have a measure of the governing power its own pessimists and its dogged opponents within the Democratic party alike have doubted it was capable of winning.And the country at large will be watching the city closely ⁠– less out of a belief in the coming apocalypse only Republicans are convinced the city is in for than out of curiosity as to whether Mamdani can actually deliver on the promise of his campaign and manage the city at least as well as an ordinary Democrat could.But the challenges sure to face him as he works to prove himself shouldn’t overshadow the significance of what he’s already done. An organizing effort that will be studied for many years to come, highly disciplined messaging, a moral stand on the genocide in Gaza that has shaken up the Democratic party’s internal politics on confronting Israel, a level of charisma and creativity unseen on the American political scene since at least Barack Obama, a conceptual bridge between the material politics of affordability and a politics of values, speaking to what it means to be a New Yorker and an American ⁠– Mamdani’s run has offered us lessons that ought to be put to work well beyond New York City’s limits.Osita Nwanevu is a columnist at Guardian US and the author of The Right of the People: Democracy and the Case for a New American FoundingJudith Levine: why are Democrats running from Mamdani?The last door on my canvassing turf, a Brooklyn brownstone, looked like a gut renovation: minimalist plantings, spot lighting. The woman welcomed me. Her vote for Mamdani “felt historic”, she said. And her husband? “Are you voting for Zohran?” she shouted into the house. The reply: “Just don’t raise my taxes.”There it was. Israel and Islamophobia moved voters one way or another. But in the end, it was pure class warfare.The city’s richest man donated $8m to defeat Mamdani. The New York Post predicted that Wall Street would move to Dallas if the democratic socialist won. “This election is a choice between capitalism and socialism,” Cuomo declared.Mamdani’s platform, “affordability”, is hardly radical. Indeed, Americans support what he promises: free childcare and raising taxes on millionaires. Gallup recently found thatDemocratsview socialism more positively than capitalism – 66 to 42%.Still, if not quite socialist, the spirit of city hall will be different: pro-immigrant, pro-tenant, pro-government, anti-billionaire. Last week, three Democratic leaders told the press they wouldn’t let the Republicans use 42 million hungry food stamp beneficiaries to force an end to the shutdown, letting healthcare subsidies lapse to bankroll tax giveaways to the rich. Then Chuck Schumer hurried out, ducking a question about whether he supported Mamdani.“A city where everyone can live with security and dignity.” Mamdani’s message, applied nationally, was the same as the message Democrats were trying to push at their press conference. In New York, it prevailed. Why are Democrats running from this gifted messenger, who embodies the only vital future for a moribund party?Judith Levine is Brooklyn-based journalist, essayist and author of five books. Her Substack isToday in FascismMalaika Jabali: ‘flicker of hope amid the gloom’If conservatives wanted to fearmonger about the specter of socialism to keep Mamdani from winning New York City’s mayoral race, it couldn’t have come at a worse time.Donald Trump, billionaire president and self-appointed foil to the new mayor-elect of New York City, has been playing games with the country’sfood stamp programas families show up in droves to food bank lines. Authoritarianism, expensive healthcare and unaffordable housing have threatened the average American household, and the country’s elites have cruelly mocked them.New York City residents have felt this acutely. The city’s voters cited cost of living, and housing in particular, as thetop concernas they exited the voting booths Tuesday.Mamdani’s popularity will be attributed to his social media savvy and connection with young voters. But the bigger factor is that Mamdani tapped into their economic anxieties in ways the Democratic establishment has failed to while it stubbornly commits to a neoliberal agenda.In the years ahead, Mamdani will not only face antagonism from Trump but the antipathy of his own party, home to Democratic leaders such as Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, none of whom endorsed him in the race. But for one night at least, New Yorkers can celebrate this flicker of hope amid the gloom.Malaika Jabali is a columnist at Guardian USBhaskar Sunkara: don’t chalk this up to ‘viral moments’I spent most of tonight thinking about how improbable this once seemed. Mamdani – a democratic socialist – is the next mayor of New York City.Zohran is an incredibly gifted communicator and he built a campaign team that matched that talent. But it would be a mistake to chalk up his victory to charisma or viral moments. It was built on knocking on doors, talking about rent, wages and the everyday costs that define people’s lives. It was a reminder that the left wins when it shows that democratic socialists are laser-focused on meeting human needs, not fighting culture wars.They tried to make the race about Israel. They tried to paint Mamdani as an extremist or a threat. But he refused the bait, staying disciplined and universal in his appeal – talking about housing, transit and affordability with the same clarity to every audience. It was politics rooted in working-class issues, not posture.Does this victory matter beyond New York? Absolutely. The style will differ in deep red districts, but the lesson is the same: build politics around the pocketbook issues workers care about most.Bhaskar Sunkara is the president of the Nation, the founding editor of Jacobin, and the author of The Socialist Manifesto: The Case for Radical Politics in An Era of Extreme InequalitiesExplore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniThe panelDemocratsNew YorkUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Until this week, when it was announced that Reddit would be added to the list of platforms required to ban under-16s from its site, joining Facebook, Instagram, X and Snapchat. Also on the Grown-Ups Only list is a video-sharing site I just learned of called Kick that has aggressively specific branding of an energy drink/youth pastor combination. Oh to be young again!For the less chronically online, Reddit is a social news aggregator that uses communities (“subreddits”) to organise content. There’s a subreddit for everything, frommainstreamjokes toniche information requests. It’s largely text-based and doesn’t cap word counts so is ideal for self-proclaimed scribes, passionate ranters and people who remember whenemotingwas popular. *humiliatingly types like this as an example*‘You’re that guy on TikTok!’: the vice-chancellor who reimagined how a Sydney university could workRead moreIf Instagram is for hot people and Facebook is for boomers, Reddit is for people who were bullied at school. I use Reddit more than any other platform and am possibly projecting. Sleep hygiene be damned, when insomnia strikes I go tor/thallasophobiaand watch videos of the deep ocean until I become very afraid and sleepy.Reports have shown the average Redditor to be just23. We know young people are dancing on TikTok, and doing whatever the hell is happening on Kick, but there are scores of nerdy children on Reddit about to be booted off the site when the ban takes effect next month. And what then, for those lost souls? Some may suggest “going outside” and I agree, up to a point.Where else can you go for addictive and polarising posts like those found onAITA, a forum that brazenly encourages two of the internet’s most common behaviours: judging strangers and lying. That group satisfies the teeny meanie inside us in a safe and consensual space – it’s harmless, like booing a spider. And what about children who make up part of the 8.6K weekly visitors of theAmish subreddit? Is that just some big joke to you?I have a soft spot for Reddit because it’s where lots of earnest dorks hang out, and part of me wishes I’d realised I was an earnest dork a bit earlier in life. Preventing younger teens from accessing social media might protect them from very real harms but it also might prevent them finding very real safety and support. There have been posts on Centrelink and AusLegal subs from young people in need of help and I’ve been heartened by how quick users are to chime in with advice and support for abused kids, lonely kids, queer kids. Reddit is also where I read about a guy who fantasises his girlfriend is a cockroach, so swings and roundabouts.Instagram restricts what teenagers can see weeks before Australia’s under-16s social media ban beginsRead moreIf the current Australian government has learned anything from the US prohibition era – which they should have – it’s that people love doing things that aren’t allowed. Drinking, dancing, wearing pants if you’re a lady … you tell someone they can’t do something and by gum they’ll find a way. Especially young people, who are always better with technology than the generation before them, just ask any two-year-old who can simultaneously beg for mummy’s iPad while soiling themselves.Maybe we’ll stumble across a new post on AITA: I enacted a policy that banned kids from social media and it backfired. Are we just creating a market for bootleg social media made by an 11-year-old coding genius? Or will kids resort to borrowing an older sibling’s phone, or something even more dastardly: creating new accounts and lying about their year of birth? Only time will tell. Perhaps they’ll resort to more primitive methods of communication by scribbling opinions on rocks and hurling them at one another.

They really had no intention of lowering rates at all.In the end, even the 7% chance the market gave of a rate cut on Tuesday was overstating it. The governor of the Reserve Bank, Michele Bullock,told reporters the RBA monetary policy boarddidn’t even discuss cutting rates.I suggestedlast weekthe RBA was rather sanguine about the rise in unemployment, and so it was. Theupdated unemployment estimatesin the November statement on monetary policy are for it to stabilise at 4.4% from now till the end of 2027 (even though it is currently 4.5%).The RBA governor resorts to sport cliches on interest rates while stretched Australians try to keep up with costsRead moreBullock told the media on Tuesday that “the board are concerned about employment as well because that is part of their mandate, but I would say at the moment we are a little more concerned about making sure we get inflation sustainably back in the band”. The only aspect I would quibble with is the “at the moment” part. It has been many years since the RBA has been more concerned about unemployment than inflation.At 3.6% the cash remains high, but the “real rate” (which takes into account inflation) is around where it was in 2016. This suggests that while interest rates are still slowing the economy (ie causing unemployment to rise) they are not at least doing so excessively.If the graph does not display click hereThe next meeting of the RBA board is on 9 December. Between now and then there will be the latest wages data, the first full monthly inflation figures and the September quarter GDP.This week, we have started to get some of the data that will feed into those GDP figures.On Mondaythe Australian Bureau of Statistics released the September quarter household spending data. This covers about 60% of the household “consumption” that makes up just over half of the economy, and the two measures move in sync.If the graph does not display click hereOne problem with the household spending data is that it includes spending on alcohol and tobacco. As the ABSnotes, the sale of illegal cigarettes has pretty much destroyed that measure because it only counts legal sales. In the past year, apparently the volume of alcohol and tobacco sold has fallen 21%. That clearly is not the case – it’s just that all the spending on tobacco is no longer being counted.If the graph does not display click hereBut even when we exclude tobacco and alcohol, household spending in the September quarter was relatively weak – up just 0.5% and less than the 1.2% growth in the June quarter.Worse still, the big growth was in spending on healthcare and food. This is despitethe RBA suggesting“data on consumption suggest that the pick-up in private demand evident in the June quarter is ongoing”.If the graph does not display click hereRather than the pickup being “ongoing”, this, as AMP economist My Bui noted, shows that “household spending has lost momentum quickly after getting a short-lived boost in May & June from weather events and EOFY sales”.But no matter, Bullock told reporters on Tuesday that the RBA still thinks “there is a bit of excess demand in the economy”.One way to test this is to look at how households spent in the run-up to the pandemic and compare how we are now spending.The period of 2014-18 saw pretty much a straight-line increase in the amount of things we spent on. Importantly, this was not a period of strong growth, but it was better than in 2019 when things slowed (because as I keep trying to remind people, we looked like heading into a recessionbeforeCovid hit).But if you extend the 2014-19 trend, you can see we have not returned to trend. And the growth of our spending is the same speed as back then.If the graph does not display click hereIf you look at all the categories in the household spending figures, most show spending at a level below the pre-Covid trend. This does not suggest excess demand at all.If the graph does not display click hereBut one area that truly shows how little heat there is in the economy is real wages. The RBArevised up its estimatesfor inflation and also slightly for wage growth. But through 2026, it now estimates that inflation will rise faster than wages.If the graph does not display click hereIf the RBA is right, then by the end of 2027 the average wage will only have the same purchasing power as it did at the end of 2011.If the graph does not display click hereThat is not a situation that suggests boom-time spending or a need to worry about excess demand.And it leaves us hoping that the RBA is right about unemployment not rising and so it does not need to cut interest rates, but also that it will be wrong and our ability to buy things with our wages will soon rise rather than go backwards.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyGrogonomicsReserve Bank of AustraliaInterest ratesInflationBusinessUnemploymentWages growthcommentShareReuse this content"

As Zohran Mamdani’s victory shows, people are desperate for policies that actually improve livesWed 5 Nov 2025 11.28 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 11.50 ESTShareIstarted my working life as a care worker on casual terms, not knowing if there would be a pay cheque from month to month. It was a good, unionised job, with decent conditions, that changed my life, and the lives of the workers I would go on to represent as a trade unionist.From my travels around the country as an MP, I have heard from so many people who are in the same position I was in. They want change, they want fairness, and they want respect at work. That’s why the Labour party promised toupgrade workers’ rights in our manifestofor the last election. In government, we are determined to see this through, ushering in what we promised: anew deal for working people.Theemployment rights billis back in the House of Commons today. If it remains intact and passes into law, it will ensure that ordinary people are better off – with basic rights from day one, turning the tide on precariousness and exploitation.This gamechanging package of measures includes protection from unfair dismissal, strengthened sick pay, bereavement leave, action against sexual harassment at work, a ban on zero-hours contracts, an end to fire and rehire, and a genuine living wage. It means family rights such as flexible working and parental leave from day one, stronger protections for pregnant women, and steps to tackle the gender pay gap. It also includes an historic fair pay agreement in social care – a new, legally binding pledge that will set minimum pay and employment terms for care workers in England and improve the standard of care.Labour has humane and popular plans to stand up for UK workers. Why dilute them?  | Gaby HinsliffRead moreTaken together, this package would be the single biggest boost to rights at work in a generation. And yet, our bill has faced fierce criticism from the Tories and Reform, and relentless lobbying from vested interests. Unelected Tory lords inserting amendments that, unless overturned, would weaken the bill to the point that it no longer met our manifesto pledges to provide basic rights from day one on the job, and to end exploitative zero-hours contracts with guaranteed hours. Today, as MPs vote in the Commons on their latest attempts to water down the bill, it is time forLabourto stand firm and make clear we are the party for working people.The attacks we face are hardly surprising. Every time we have made progress on employment rights over the last 45 years, they have been resisted – from the maternity allowance to equal pay for women, health and safety rights, or the minimum wage.The last Conservative government took regressive measures, such as shamefully doubling the qualification period for protectionagainst unfair dismissal to two years. They stripped workers of protections at the stroke of a pen. Now they are at it again, with brazen attempts to water down this flagship legislation. They must again be resisted.Preserving and passing the employment rights bill into law is not just fulfilling a manifesto commitment – it is about fixing a broken model.Key measures in this bill have been backed by many of the best businesses. They know that if you treat people well, you get the best out of them. They recognise that being pro-worker is not a barrier to success, but a launchpad to it. That is why this bill takes the very best standards from the very best businesses and extends them to millions more workers. It is also why we proudly say that this is a pro-business and pro-worker bill.This landmark legislation will give working people across the country security and dignity that they will be able to feel. As Tuesday evening’sresults in New Yorkshow, growth only means something to ordinary working people if they can see it and communities have something to show for it.These measures will be tangible to the thousands of pregnant women and mothers who will benefit from new maternity protections, and the tens of thousands of fathers and partners who will be brought into the scope of paternity leave. In every corner of this country, millions will benefit from a decent wage and secure work they can raise a family on – 1.7 million will benefit from new policies on flexible working, 2 million will receive a right to bereavement leave, 9 million employees will benefit from protection against unfair dismissal from day one.This is a once-in-a-generation chance to reshape the world of work, to drive a race to the top on standards, to deliver growth and build an economy that works for everyone. This bill was the promise we made to the British public. It is our duty to deliver it. So I will support my frontbench colleagues every step of the way in doing just that.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But a year in, that resolve is crumblingWed 5 Nov 2025 06.56 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 11.35 ESTShareKemi Badenoch has recently marked her first anniversary as leader, and much of the commentary (to the extent that the Tories manage to garner any commentary) has focused on one thing: the fact that she can now be formally challenged for the role.The significance of this milestone should not, however, be overstated. Unlike the Labour party, theConservativesdo not really have an internal regime governed by rigid rules. The one-year grace period for a new leader is simply a rule adopted by the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs, and they could dispose of it simply by changing their minds.In truth, Badenoch’s leadership is in a sort of twilight zone. Whatever glow surrounded her early days as leader has long since faded, dimmed by the slide in the polls that began immediately upon the conclusion of last year’s leadership contest and extinguished completely by the rout at the local elections in May.A good party conference in Manchester has done little to change this trajectory. It certainly staved off any immediate panic, but it didn’t tell the Tories anything they didn’t know already – to wit, that Badenoch can use the spotlight to good effect when events point it at her.The much more important question was whether she had the ability or the appetite to win the spotlight in the modern media’s fiercely competitive attention economy, and this she has so far failed to do. A year ago, this looked like a basic misjudgment – that the party could afford to take its time with five years until the next election – but nor has she been able to pick up any momentum from conference, with the Tories falling back off the media’s radar during October.All of this is reflectedin the polls, which tell a story that would make life difficult for any leader. After last year’s general election the Conservatives gained on Labour until November, then went into an immediate slide. Reform UK overtook the Tories’ average polling in January, and a couple of months later there was a much sharper collapse as Nigel Farage’s party picked up lots of Tory switchers.Badenoch has since stabilised her polling. But it has plateaued only at the same level at which the Conservativeslost two-thirdsof all the seats they were defending in the most recent local elections, and that is a full seven points down from the position she inherited last November.In light of all that, and the modern Tory party’s penchant for regicide, it is perhaps surprising that her leadership appears as stable as it does. But one by one, the buttresses that have propped it up are starting to crack.First, there was the perfectly fair argument that any new leader needed time to make their mark; her first anniversary probably signifies the expiry date of that one. Second was the concern that the party really needed to stop disposing of leaders quite so quickly. But it is far less momentous to replace a leader of the opposition than a prime minister, and this concern is likewise losing its potency.Perhaps the most important one remaining, at least for the critical MPs who make up the swing votes, is the want of an alternative. Badenoch secured the leadership in part by adroitly positioning herself to MPs as “not Robert Jenrick”, and to those MPs that remains the core of her appeal.But even that is losing its force. The problem is that while “not Robert Jenrick” was a majority proposition, it was also a fundamentally negative one. By sticking to bromides about Tory “values” and refusing to offer her own diagnosis of what went wrong between 2010 and 2024, Badenoch assembled a coalition that doesn’t agree on anything.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But neither they nor she has an alternative case to make. What was once said of the Labour right in the 1970s is equally true of today’s Tory centrists: “They had principles, and they had preferences, but they had no ideas.”Unhappily for Badenoch, the main buttress to her leadership today is the looming shadow of next year’s local elections. On current polling they would be just as brutal as this year’s, and risk gutting the party’s representation not just in another swath of English local government, but in the Scottish and Welsh parliaments too.The basic political calculation of the overwhelming majority of those Conservatives who have despaired of her leadership is simple: that it is better for them if Badenoch owns those elections.

I write “camouflage” in inverted commas because it was blue and, amid the dusty devastation of Gaza, there was nothing about it – or the bumbag he wore with it – that helped Witkoff blend in.It’s an odd paradox that a pattern designed to melt military personnel into their surroundings – the word is derived from the Frenchcamoufler, “to disguise” – when worn by certain people, in certain ways, does the opposite. Witkoff being a glaring example.But camouflage is chameleon-like. Militaristic or pacifist, Britpop or British army, there’s arguably no pattern that has a more functional original purpose or greater adaptability when deployed far from the battlefield. Context is king and camouflage reads wildly differently when itappears on a tieworn by the hawkish veteran and “secretary of war” Pete Hegseth, on the Louis Vuitton catwalk, in the fields of Glastonbury or even at a protest against conflict: one person’s sabre rattling is another’s anti-war statement.It is perhaps its adaptability that means it has moments, such as now, of increased popularity. Style-wise it’s a symptom of the throwback-Y2K moment and, from Gap to Next, Damson Madder to JW Anderson, it’snotblending in everywhere. In the US, hunting camo has been spottedadorning everythingfrom Kamala Harris and Tim Walz baseball caps to rightwing libertarians.On the one hand camo is,says Vogue, “a stylish alternative to denim”, available at democratically low prices, as well as a relatively sustainable option – the likes of eBay are awash with camo clothing. On the other hand, it isn’tjusta pattern in the way of gingham or paisley – the rise of camouflage was a symptom of theincreased destructiveness of modern warfare, and even today its military associations are so entrenched that in certain countries it’s not allowed to be worn by non-military personnel. In several Caribbean nations, for instance, it’s prohibited other than for active members of the police or military. The South African National Defence Force recentlyissueda warningto the public to stop wearing its camouflage.For civilians, there are statements to be madebecauseof its military associations: a countercultural vibe is what brought camouflage to the backs of Vietnam war protesters and Jimi Hendrix. Pacifists wearing it are leveraging its military footing. For others, such as the formerMoschino designer Jeremy Scott, “camo is a classic, no different than plaid or polka dots”. Even Claudia sodding Winkleman has worn it in the past. It can, no doubt, be fun to wear – I would know, having spent the late 90s singing along to Never Ever in All Saints-inspired camo combats.It feels natural that it’s having, for want of a better word, this moment. The world feels tumultuous. It perhaps always has done. But there’sevidence to suggestit is increasingly turbulent – one nonprofit organisation recently estimated that in the past five years global conflict had doubled, and that one in eight people worldwide had been exposed to it.There are devastating conflicts taking place in the midst of civilian populations, in the cities of Sudan and Ukraine and in Gaza. In the US, troops are being deployed to city streets in unprecedented ways, inspiringa recent New York Times piecedelineating the different camouflage uniforms of the federal forces, from the national guard to ICE.Fashion, both in the sense of what is sent down the catwalks but also in the everyday – the person picking up a camo jacket from army surplus or Depop – is in communication with all of this, whether consciously or subliminally. Look to Elsa Schiaparelli, who presented a military-themed collection in the run-up to war being declared in 1930s France. Fashion loves drama, and nothing, tragically, is more dramatic than war.Civilians wanting to wear camo could be responding to a scary world, knowingly nodding to it; they could be making a pointed anti-war statement or one of battle-readiness even while picking up a pint of milk. But, in an increasingly divided world, how it might be received feels more and more blurry.And the idea of wearing, for fun, a print designed to help people avoid detection is an added complication when you consider it through the lens of those living in conflict zones who really are unable to hide.More broadly, the politics of who gets to wear civilian or military garb feels increasingly fraught – look at the political fights overVolodymyr Zelenskyy’s military-style outfitsand his decision to not wear civilian suits until war in his country is over. Melania Trump’s military-style get-ups can feel uncomfortably close to martial cosplay, such as the time she wore a “dictator chic”Alexander McQueen khaki green suitto the 2020 Republican national convention.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was the subject of a New York Times piece last summer in which the fashion critic Vanessa Friedman said she was officially changing her stance on it. The last time shereceived a queryasking: “Can I still wear camo?” was in 2021, just after the Capitol insurrection – a number of those in the mob were wearing it. At the time, she suggested camo was OK as long as it was clearly a fashion item and didn’t look like a uniform. This year, however, she said she was changing her advice on the basis of respect for the military, having received a letter from a veteran who called the fashion choice “akin to stolen valour”. But also, the state of the world. As Friedman put it: “Wearing camouflage as a fashion statement seems like an increasingly tone-deaf and potentially dangerous choice.”All of which is to say that camouflage is complicated and the very context making it feel relevant is also what is making it feel especially loaded. Do I think it’s inappropriate? No. Do I wantthis camo T-shirtbut think I might feel a bit icky wearing it?

That’s going to be a problem for Reform UKWed 5 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 08.22 ESTShareNigel Farage loves a gamble. Inhis 2015 memoir, The Purple Revolution, a whole chapter is dedicated to the then Ukip leader’s appetite for risk, how he indulged it in the City and how that prepared him for a career in politics.He boasts of the time he “lost a seven-figure sum of money in the course of a morning on the zinc market” before breezing off to the pub. He waxes nostalgic about the halcyon days of freewheeling finance, before “ghastly regulators” spoiled the fun; when “terrible cock-ups” could be written off because “decimal points and all those zeros can be tricky after a three-hour lunch”.Farage the commodities trader was not a details guy. Farage the politician isn’t famously punctilious either, but the stakes are higher. He’s backing himself to be prime minister and it isn’t going to happen if voters see him as the kind of gambler who might blow the nation’s budget on a boozy bet.Dispelling that notion was thepurpose of a speechby the Reform UK leader on Monday. Farage disposed of his party’s 2024 election manifesto and its promise oftax cuts worth £90bnbecause it was a tissue of fiscal fantasy. He didn’t put it quite like that. He observed that Britain’s sluggish growth and high debt demand sober management of public finances. He hinted that Treasury savings could one day be made by unpicking the sacred “triple lock” that guarantees perpetual real-terms rises in the state pension.Liz Truss was not named, but the new, parsimonious Farageonomics has been formulated to silence comparisons between Reform’s agenda and thebudget misadventureof the Tory prime minister whose unfunded tax giveaway incinerated the nation’s financial credibility.It’s the Nigel Farage chameleon show – flashy, ever-changing pledges, but only one real policy: xenophobia  | Polly ToynbeeRead moreBy dabbling in macroeconomics, Farage also wants to show that he has range; that the policy repertoire extends beyond complaining about migrants. He can also complain about the Bank of England (too cautious over cryptocurrencies), the Financial Conduct Authority (captured by a “diversity agenda”), public sector pensions (“a massive liability”) and net zero (a burden on energy bills).Europe can’t be the scapegoat it once was, but the old moan can be retuned to a post-Brexit key: the opportunity of deregulation from Brussels red tape has been “squandered”. Killjoy regulators tame the animal spirits of the market. The bureaucratic state lavishes welfare on work-shy malingerers and banishes enterprising wealth-creators. The remedy is to slash disability benefits and use tax breaks to entice self-exiled non-doms back from Dubai. The fiscal details of how that might all add up – the decimal points and zeros – remain shrouded in post-prandial haze.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage and Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House, 4 September 2025.Photograph: TwitterThe trademark colour and name of Farage’s party has changed since The Purple Revolution, but the argument hasn’t evolved. The biggest difference is in his delivery, which has become less hectoring, more weary. Maybe Farage was deliberately sounding leaden to emphasise his commitment to fiscal responsibility, but he came across as a man who is boring even himself with the usual shtick.This may be why he regularly asserts that the next general election will come in 2027. There is no reason why Keir Starmer would choose to go to the country two years before the constitutional deadline, but Farage needs the vote to come as soon as possible. To complete the transition from protest vehicle to plausible prime minister, the Reform leader needs to woo uncertain voters who think he could be dangerous. That reassurance has a cost in radicalism.Momentum depends on the keenest supporters staying whipped up in a state of visceral outrage, while respectability means keeping a lid on Reform MPs’ and councillors’most luridly racist, outlandish and violent opinions. Affecting mainstream seriousness and cultivating insurrection at the same time is a chore. The strain is showing.Economic policy poses a particular challenge because the US rightwing populist model, Farage’s inspiration in most areas, resists adaptation to British financial circumstances. Not that it hasn’t been tried. Kent county council, Reform UK’s flagship local authority,promised to implementDoge-style cuts to administrative waste, inspired by Elon Musk’s maverick assault on the US federal budgets. The result was achaotic displayof unprofessional political dysfunction.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Normal rules of fiscal rectitude don’t apply –at least, not yet– to the country that issues the planet’s reserve currency and can always find buyers for its debt.This “exorbitant privilege” extended to the world’s richest and most powerful state is what allowed Donald Trump earlier this year toimplement tax cutsthat will drive the US deficit up into the region of $3tn-$4tn by the end of the decade. The White House claims the budget will be self-repairing with money generated by newly stimulated growth. That’s also what Truss said. The bond market was not convinced.Trump also thinks tariffs imposed on other countries will be a substitute for domestic tax revenue. He’s wrong both conceptually and arithmetically. Tariffs are an import tax paid ultimately by US consumers, not foreigners, and the Treasury income hardly dents the deficit. But for now the absurdity of it just hangs in the air, defying economic gravity.That trick is not available to a UK prime minister. Nor is Trump’s habit ofshaking downUS corporate giants forequity and cash. If Reform so much as flirted with Trumponomics in an election manifesto, markets would convulse at every opinion poll putting it in the lead. Labour would correctly warn that a vote for Reform is a vote to bankrupt Britain.Farage is a gambler, not a fool. He knows he has to moderate his tone and get across some budget details. But attention to detail has never been his thing and responsibility bores him. Maybe he can win without it. He might fancy the odds onLabourcontinuing to flounder, the Tories failing to get their act together and that combination being enough to put him in Downing Street. And yet it is revealing how vulnerable the Reform leader obviously feels on the economy. His old script is stale, and without the Maga playbook to crib from, he really has nothing new to say – and a long time to be exposed not saying it.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsNigel FarageOpinionReform UKLabourEconomic policyTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Even Dutch liberals show little interest in the contribution of migrantsWed 5 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 03.11 ESTShareThe neighbourhood where I live in west Amsterdam is one of the most vibrantly diverse in the city, inhabited by people from every corner of the globe. Some are new arrivals, others are descended from parents and grandparents who came here 30 or more years ago. In the shopping mall I hear Arabic and Turkish along with Dutch, English and a smattering of other languages that I cannot readily identify. The market square is crowded with stalls selling all manner of vegetables, fish and spices, along with hijabs and abayas. The vendors call out in a mixture of Dutch and Arabic. My butcher addresses me as Abi – Turkish for “older brother” – even though he knows I am not from Turkey.There is a sense that we are all in this together, and it is up to us to make the most of it. I see patrols of concerned neighbours who take it upon themselves to gather up rubbish that has been dropped on the streets by careless kids. Although this mix feels quite natural, this is the kind of place that Geert Wilders would describe as amulticultural hell.The point Wilders insists on overlooking is that it is precisely this blend of people and backgrounds that has made Amsterdam unique. Amsterdammers are proud of the city’s diversity. If you read theeponymously titled bookby Geert Mak, you will see that the city’s history is one of tolerance and a pragmatic approach to difference, whether religious, racial or cultural. This pragmatism is a defining Dutch quality. Visitors see coffee shops and the red light district without understanding that the tolerance that created them is what has allowed the city to thrive and become what it is today.Wilders has long played on the fears of Dutch people, some of which appear to have deepened since the pandemic. The debates in the run-up tolast month’s electionwere dominated by the housing crisis, the cost of living and the number of migrants and asylum seekers coming into the country.Yet most Dutch people have little, if any, meaningful contact with migrants or asylum seekers in their daily life: their opinions are largely steered by public debate.The violent killing in August of a17-year-old, allegedly at the hands of an asylum seeker, sparked national outrage. The teenager was cycling home late at night when she was attacked. Her death prompted a newprotest movementled by women demanding the right to move freely at any hour of the day or night. But violent crimes such as this, where the suspect is a migrant, present a severe challenge to the Dutch liberal mindset and the public reaction is often exploited to fuel the rightward political shift.Nevertheless, last week’s election confirmed that the more extreme course that Wilders and his coalition allies tried to steer, aftertheir 2023 victory, has failed. Voters chose a return to a more secure middle ground. The centrist D66 party, whichnarrowly wonthe highest vote share, represents a progressive line. Its leader Rob Jetten, most likely the next prime minister, is young, athletic and gay. His popularity in recent months had been boosted by his participation ina popular television quizshow.Yet, despite the chaos of nearly two years of the far right in government, culminating in thecollapse of the coalitionin June, Wilders has managed to drag the political ballast to the right. The most notable example of this is the liberal-conservative VVD party that, under its previous leader, Mark Rutte, won four consecutive elections. The current leader, Dilan Yeşilgöz, cosied up to Wilders – and was widely criticised for it – but the VVD lost only two seats.Leftwing politics seemed to find little resonance among younger Dutch voters, as they looked for practical solutions to concerns that the traditional parties have been unable to deliver.One element I found noticeably absent from the pre-election debates was any real effort to engage with the voices of people from minority communities. While the issue of migrants and, in particular, Muslim migrants, was centre-stage in the run-up to the election, their own voice was strangely missing. Somehow, while the majority may support a liberal agenda, most people lack any practical understanding of the minority experience. This is true even in elite cultural circles, such as the literary world, where efforts have been made in recent years to include voices representing the migrant experience. It nevertheless remains, by and large, homogeneously white and middle-class.As for issues that might concern the minority, there was no mention, for example, of the damage done by the2018 child benefits scandalwhenup to 26,000parents were falsely accused of making fraudulent claims for financial help. When it became clear that the government had been targeting people based on theirethnic or racial background,the government collapsed.One of the few parties to discuss the country’s colonial history and the contribution made by immigrants is BiJ1, a small party named after article 1 in the Dutch constitution, that forbids discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation or disability. Founded by Sylvana Simons, one of the few black politicians in this country, the party scored no seats and finished up behind the animal rights party.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The forces supporting his far-right agenda are powerful, and growing, acrossEuropeand beyond. Perhaps the challenge facing the Netherlands is to find a balance between the ideals of freedom, equality and tolerance, and more pragmatic concerns about security and economic growth.Still, I miss the days when passing cyclists might smile in greeting, and instead now look at me with suspicion. I hope that one day they, too, will realise that the key to this country’s future lies in its multiplicity, and that denying or ignoring this fact only increases polarisation. The multicultural society is not going away any time soon, whether we like it or not; the best we can do is to try to make it work for everyone.Jamal Mahjoub is a writer of British and Sudanese heritage who lives in the Netherlands.

By allowing working parents time to grieve, Baby Priya’s bill will change livesGemma KillenI can hardly imagine how hard it would have been to return to a workplace that had declared that I was not a parent – and that my baby didn’t really countTue 4 Nov 2025 21.21 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 18.00 ESTShareThis week I became somewhat of a vigilante keyboard warrior, trawling posts about the passing of baby Priya’s bill to correct every commenter that wilfully misunderstood the bill or used it as an excuse to pick a fight about women’s rights. No, the bill will not put small business owners out of business by forcing them to offer unlimited paid leave. No, the bill won’t mean women’s employment numbers go down. And very importantly, no, the bill does not incentivise late-term terminations.The Australian federal parliament passed baby Priya’s bill – an amendment to the Fair Work Act – to ensure employers cannot cancel paid parental leave in the event of stillbirth or because a baby dies after birth. The change brings employer paid parental leave in line with government-funded parental leave and unpaid parental leave.The bill is named for baby Priya, who died at 42 days old, and whose parents unwaveringly led the charge for change.Barnaby Joyce and Andrew Hastie rebuked for ‘playing politics’ on abortion in debate on stillbirth leaveRead morePriya’s mum’s parental leave was cancelled when Priya died – even though she had already been on leave for six weeks. Rather than being given the grace and the time to recover and grieve, she was expected to return to work or take unpaid leave. She had worked for her employer for 11 years.On an average day in Australia, eight babies die in the perinatal period:six are stillborn and two die within 28 days of birth. This means that every year, thousands of Australian families have to deal with the sad - that accompanies a baby’s death: cancelling appointments, letting friends and family know, applying for income support, organising funerals and taking time away from work.I was nearing the end of a fixed-term contract at a major university when my son, Jin, was stillborn at the end of 2020. My contract ended quietly sometime between planning his funeral and frantically Googling ways to stop my breastmilk from coming in.Baby Priya’s mother is my hero. And the four conservative men that used her courage to start a fight about terminations are anything butMy employer counted the last few weeks of my contract as annual leave; I applied for government leave and hoped it would be enough to cover the time I needed to recover physically, if not the lifetime I might need to recover emotionally.Baby Priya’s bill would not have helped me, but it would have helped my partner, Yen. In the weeks before Jin’s death, Yen had six months of parental leave approved. In the days after his death, the leave was cancelled. A good friend scoured the Fair Work legislation and the university’s enterprise agreement to see if there was any way they could still access the leave.HR remained firm: the only option was to take a year’s worth of sick, carer’s and annual leave at once.Three months after his birth, Yen returned to work full-time, with no option to take a sick day or a mental health day. When I went to follow-up appointments at the hospital or with our IVF doctor, Yen took unpaid leave to come with me.Three months after Jin’s death, I found a new job that was gracious enough to allow me a staggered start. For a month, I worked only two days a week, but at the end of each of those days I was exhausted. Most days, I cried for the length of my commute and through my lunch break, sitting in the park behind my office.I can hardly imagine how hard it would have been to return to a workplace that had definitively declared that I was not a parent and that my baby didn’t really count – despite his birth certificate on my wall and his ashes in a small urn on my mantle.Baby Priya’s mother is my hero. And the four conservative men that used her courage to start a fight about terminations are anything but.Parents who have to make the decision to terminate their precious and much-wanted pregnancies do so with love and bravery in their hearts. What could make someone more of a parent than protecting their baby from pain and suffering?If the politicians that suggested the bill would incentivise terminations really cared about reducing the number of babies who die in the perinatal period, they would be on the frontline, fundraising for stillbirth prevention research. They would make speeches about how the rate of stillbirth in Australia has not decreased in several decades and in factincreased in 2022. They would investigate the racism and inaccessibility in the maternity and medical systems that mean Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mothers are more likely to experience stillbirth.Jin would have turned five this month. My mum will make a cake (a digger, of course), and we will all go to the lake where we held his memorial to remember him and who he might have become.I will light a candle for my baby, and for Baby Priya, and hope she knows how many lives she has changed for the better.Gemma is the director of the National Women’s Equality Portfolio at the Working with Women AllianceIn Australia, support for people who are grieving is available fromGrieflineon 1300 845 745Explore more on these topicsOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

When the big moment came, she heard “the winner is …” and then the feed froze. “We were going, ‘Oh God!’ Running around. We didn’t know what to do. The timing was like something in a comedy.” Congratulations immediately rushed in, which is how she knew she’d won the £50,000 (A$100,000) prize forHow to End a Story, an 800-page collection of her astoundingly frank diaries, kept between 1978 and 1998.Garner is still grappling with her win when we speak a few hours later. “I’m a stunned mullet,” she says, sitting in her study, wrapped in a lilac shawl and with glasses on a cord around her neck. “I didn’t think I had a chance.” She has absolutely no idea what she said in her thank you speech: “I think I’m in shock.”In her 80s, Garner is experiencing a career high. After decades of being ignored overseas, “Australia’s Joan Didion” has become cool. Carrie Bradshaw recently toted a hardback of Garner’s debut novel,Monkey Grip, in an episode of And Just Like That as if it were a must-have purse,while Dua Lipa (“a complete sweetheart”) picked Garner’s accountof a murder trial,This House of Grief, for her enormously popularbook club. Garner is “thrilled to bits” by all of this. “My street cred has gone through the roof!” she laughs.View image in fullscreen‘She’s a complete sweetheart’ … Dua Lipa poses with a copy of This House of Grief.Photograph: Permanent Press MediaWhen Monkey Grip was published in 1977, Australian critics were dismissive, even outraged, by its clear autobiographical inspirations. “Helen Garner has published her private journal rather than written a novel,” one sniffed. It was a charge Garner could hardly deny, having spent months drawing from her diaries to write its story of the love affair between a divorced single mother and a heroin addict in Melbourne.“Although it was true, I huffily defended myself against that claim, because it rests upon the idea that writing a diary is sloppy,” she says. “That it is just some sludgy flow of feminine whinging that comes out of a woman and she writes it down and calls it a book. I was enraged on a deep level by the suggestion that diaries were muck and not worthy of people’s attention. Now I’m happy to say that Monkey Grip was based on my diaries.”Almost 50 years later, she is winning acclaim and prizes for publishing her actual diaries. She loves that How to End a Story has won a prize for nonfiction, a term normally reserved for grander histories: “The fact that my diaries were flung into that big category called nonfiction – I thought, ‘Hooray! They found a home.’”How to End a Story is really three volumes, starting after the birth of her daughter Alice (M in the diaries) and her divorce from her first husband, Bill Garner. The first (1978-1987) opens just after Monkey Grip was published and maps out the collapse of her second marriage, to Frenchman Jean-Jacques Portail. The second (1987-1995) finds her beginning an affair with the (married) Australian novelist Murray Bail, while the third (1995-1998) charts the end of their marriage – her third and final. (She has been happily divorced ever since.)The Garner of the diaries seems so far away from the grande dame of today. She is nervy and weepy, desperate for praise and scorchingly self-critical. “I will never be a great writer,” she writes in one entry. “The best I can do is to write books that are small but oblique enough to stick in people’s gullets so that they remember them.” But she is also great company: observant and smart, able to find beauty in the smallest of moments. “Spring night: black sky speckled with stars, air cool and thickly scented with grass, and the odours of things growing.” And humour too: “At the hippies’ house for dinner, I find in my slice of quiche two foreign items: a dead match and a pubic hair. I hide them under a lettuce leaf and we go on talking.” She puts words to even her strangest impulses; after seeing a peacock “preening like a Brazilian drag queen”, she fights “a powerful urge to run out there and sink the toe of my boot into his fluffy arse”.View image in fullscreenThe cover of How to End a Story.Photograph: Text PublishingAlmost every reviewer has noted the ferocity of Garner’s anger on the page – towards husbands, bad friends, some children, complete strangers. “Anger is often very shameful for women,” Garner tells me. “I never feel surprised when I read about a woman murdering a man,” she adds, offering a glimpse of the writer who has haunted so many Australian courtrooms over the years – she is about to publish a book on the mushroom murder trial. “I have noticed and understood just how much we have to cop in order to live a peaceful life. Sometimes, a woman will just snap. I figure that they wouldn’t if we didn’t have to crush the anger and pretend it’s not happening.”For Garner, writing a diary is an “intellectually and psychologically serious” exercise; she probes her own behaviour and thoughts, and tests the limits of her observation skills. They are also technically serious, “a sort of daily practice”, she says, for all of the books that were released around them.For years, her novels were seen as too domestic to be significant, while her nonfiction featured too much of herself to be objective. She is sure much of this was sexism. “Back in the 70s, women writers were always criticised for being too narrow and, looking back, too personal. But people didn’t actually say that – we were ‘small canvas’. Everybody had to be writing four-generation family sagas. People don’t talk like that any more. And if they do, they don’t have any power.”But by the 2010s, Garner was a national treasure at home. Her Australian publisher Text even put hershopping listonline because so many readers said they would literally read anything she wrote. When publishing her diaries was first floated, Garner’s initial thought was, “There’s no way I’d do that.” She had actually destroyed her first diaries, burning a pile in her back yard in Fitzroy North in the 1980s: “I thought, these are really trashy, they’re boring and shit, so I’m going to burn them.”But when she revisited the later diaries and realised they were interesting and written carefully, she set herself some rules: she would edit out “the boring stuff, the day’s residue”, but she would not rewrite entries. She contacted friends and family to warn them if they appeared. “Other people I did not consult because I thought they had it coming, to put it crudely,” she says. Names would be changed, she wrote, and if anyone wanted to see the entries they were in, they could: “I wasn’t exactly asking permission but, if somebody really, really didn’t want me to say something, I wouldn’t. But I was very happy that a lot of people wrote back and said, ‘I trust you.’ That was a wonderful moment for me.”View image in fullscreen‘Anger is often very shameful for women’: Helen Garner.Photograph: Charlie KinrossGarner likes her diaries more than anything else she has written. “I feel free when I’m writing in it. I’m not writing to please anybody else, I don’t have a deadline and I can say things in there that I wouldn’t say elsewhere.” Though, she adds, “There are things I don’t put in my diaries, now I’ve got the reputation for publishing them – I suppose some people must quake in their boots.”She still keeps one today, scratching away with a fountain pen while sitting in bed first thing in the morning or last thing at night. Her subjects have changed since her last published volume: her three grandchildren, who have lived next door all their lives and make many entertaining cameos in Garner’s writing, are now all over 18. “My years of being a hands-on nanna are over, to my great sadness,” Garner says. “So my life is different and my diary is different.”She is also noticing signs of cognitive decline. “I’m starting to forget a lot of things,” she says. Her mother died of Alzheimer’s at 82, and she worries about “cracking up”. Some words take longer to come. “But the most annoying thing is, I make spelling mistakes now,” she says. “I’m fanatical about spelling and punctuation. And now I flip back and think, ‘What isthatword?’”But she is still Helen Garner; even her own ageing is something to observe forensically. “I find it very interesting,” she muses. “I actually feel that I am old now. I’ll be 83 this week and I don’t know how much longer I’ve got.” Regardless of whether there are any more books in her, she will continue writing her diaries until the day she dies. “I can’t imagine finding life boring,” she says, with a small, satisfied smile. “The world around me is so interesting. There is always something to write about, so I’ll keep going.”How to End a Story: Collected Diaries by Helen Garner is published by Wiedenfeld & Nicolson in the UK (£30) and by Text Publishing in Australia (A$59.99).

My photos from that time feel important now because that community is gone’Interview byAmy FlemingWed 5 Nov 2025 09.27 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 14.42 ESTShareThis picture was taken in our beauty shop inBradford, called Shade. Janet (right) was a friend of my then wife Melanie (left). I’d spent a good two years taking photos and I enjoyed it, not that I thought my work was good enough to be shown in an art gallery. I couldn’t earn enough from photography to cover the costs of the materials, so we decided to get a bank loan and open the shop instead, with Janet as a partner.I first got into photography in 1983, aged 28, after I was made redundant from my truck-driving job. I had a friend who did photojournalism and I used to go and watch him develop black-and-white photos in his darkroom, where you have a red light on to see what you’re doing. So when I heard about someone who was selling a colour kit, I jumped at the chance. I thought my friend was going to help me learn how to use it but he didn’t know how to develop colour photographs. It was only when I started teaching myself that I realised how difficult it is.My photos from that time feel important now because that community is gone. They took down the flats, and the whole community spread out. In the summer there used to be a congregation of African-Caribbean people outside the Perseverance hotel or the Young Lions cafe. There was always music on and people who knew me. One of my photos is of a guy with a ghetto blaster – there was always someone with one. In the cafe there would be one on the shelf, belonging to some customer or other. There was also a pool table, and there were always people sat in there, whether they were eating or not.Walking into the exhibition and seeing all my photos enlarged on the walls, I thought I must be dreamingRecently the pictures have found new audiences. My friend Ned Archibong, who works for Bradford 2025 UK City of Culture, knew about them. I got them digitised about 25 years ago and every so often I’d put one or two on Facebook and get loads of comments. When Ned told me that the people at City of Culture wanted to exhibit them, I couldn’t believe it. They went on display in an old converted warehouse calledLoading Bay. I parked the car and walked to the building and found myself staring at a billboard with a photo of my friend, Michael, a poet. He had written a poem to go with my photos. As the lift door opened on to the gallery, my name filled the wall. Walking in and seeing all my photos enlarged, I thought I must be dreaming.The exhibition then went up at theNational Science and Media Museum in Bradford. I thought it would be in one of the rooms upstairs but no, it was in the main foyer! There was also a smaller selection on display as part of a group show at Sunny Bank Mills, in Leeds.The beauty shop in this picture was derelict when we got it, and we worked hard to sort it out, but the business went down within 10 months. What we never took into consideration was the fact that the African-Caribbean community in Bradford was small.I moved to Birmingham after that and worked for a bakery, which was hell. About a year later Melanie and I got divorced, and I moved back to Bradford with my daughter. I eventually settled down working for the NHS where I stayed until I retired four years ago. I still take photographs on my phone, though not professionally.Victor Wedderburn’s photographs can be viewed on theAutographphotography website.View image in fullscreenVictor Wedderburn’s CVBorn:Jamaica, 1954High point:“As part of my exhibition they had some of my images blown-up large on billboards – it was unbelievable driving around town and seeing my work that big!”Top tip:“If you’re working with film, store your negatives and keep them in good condition, you never know when you might need them.”Explore more on these topicsPhotographyMy best shotBradfordBlack British culturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

She is only a couple of minutes late, but she is keen to explain. “I have such a problem, because I’m ayapperon the phone. I had two calls before this, and I’m like, I’ve gotta stop talking!” Luckily, it’s exactly what a writer wants to hear at the start of an interview. Besides, it’s fairly unsurprising. Anyone who has watched the unapologetically queer,unapologetically crass film Bottoms– which Sennott co-wrote with Emma Seligman, and starred in alongside her friend,The Bear’s breakout star Ayo Edebiri– will already know that she has plenty to say, be it about gender, sex, or the merits of starting a high-school fight club. And by the end of her new eight-part HBO series I Love LA, it is clear that she has even more to say about the darker side of Gen Z life (at 30, she is an honorary member of the gang, a tale-end millennial with a knack for straddling both generations).The comparisons toLena Dunham’s Girlsare inevitable and Sennott is, of course, a fan, citing the show alongsideSex and the City,InsecureandAtlantaas influences for her series, which follows the travails of an influencer, Tallulah (Odessa A’Zion) and her friend and fledgling talent manager, Maia (Sennott). Perhaps the largest spot on the moodboard, though, went to Entourage, the HBO sitcom about a rising A-list actor making his way in an often-seedy Hollywood (choice quote: “nobody’s happy in this town except for the losers”). Sennott started watching it during the pandemic, became “obsessed”, and decided to put her own twist on it “for the girls and the gays”.“I wanted to make a show where the internet, not Hollywood, was the industry, because my career started online,” she says. The idea for I Love LA came – in part – from her own, initially fractious, move to Tinseltown and from hersaturn return, a much-talked-about event for astrology heads. It was a period that saw her learn some big life lessons, professionally and personally. “In my early 20s I was so messy, crying in public everywhere, all the time,” she says. “In my mid-20s, I moved to LA and got settled. And then I felt like everything started to just fall apart. It was almost like these biblical tests …”Raised in Connecticut, Sennott began writing and performing comedy while studying acting at New York University (NYU) Tisch School of the Arts. “I went through all the proper channels to try to perform, and they weren’t gelling,” she says. “I tried out for all the NYU comedy groups, and got rejected from all of them. I tried out for all the NYU plays and didn’t make it into any of them. And I just felt like, what am I doing here?”View image in fullscreen‘Now I do love LA!’ … Sennott.Sennott took matters into her own hands, performing at open mics with Edebiri and posting hysterical (and decidedly weird) comedy videos online. One,Baby Cult, followed a group of women fetishistically obsessed with pregnancy;anotherimagined working at the preppy clothing store Hollister as akin to being trapped in a horror film. In a neat twist of fate, she met Seligman through the university’s film scene and ended up starring in herdirectorial debut, Shiva Baby, a tense comedy set at a Jewish wake with shades of Uncut Gems. The big theme of her career, she says, has been people her own age giving her a shot, rather than the industry at large. So, not the gatekeepers, then? “Notthe gatekeepers”, she repeats, adding with a laugh: “They don’t want us to win.”Anyone who had doubts about Sennott then will surely be kicking themselves now. In what she describes as a “wild, full-circle” turn of events, she seems to have manifested her dream vehicle.In 2019 she posted a video called “it’s LA” online,in which she lampooned Hollywood trailers (“I’m addicted to drugs – we all are”). Six years on, she’s the co-showrunner (with Emma Barrie) of a comedy about Angelenos balancing the perks of internet fame (such as partying at Elijah Wood’s house) with its pitfalls (your client being accused of being a drug-addled thief, and potentially becoming a “brand unsafe” pariah). It would be easy to make a show about online fame that was horribly aspirational – or, worse, one that punched down at its subjects. I Love LA does neither, making for a portrait of privileged twentysomething life that’s frank about the grot and the glamour.View image in fullscreenJordan Firstman as Charlie, True Whitaker as Alani, Odessa A’zion as Tallulah and Rachel Sennott as Maia in I Love LA.Photograph: HBO/Sky Comedy“There have been a lot of shows that depict young people and their relationship to the internet in this very condescending, hateful way,” she says. “I think that young people have been through a lot – I’m mostly thinking of people younger than me, like my little sister, who went to college during Covid, so she had to come home, or my other sister who was doing school online.” These days, she says, “it doesn’tfeel likethe world is falling apart – the worldisfalling apart. And you get to a point where it’s depressing, it makes you nihilistic.” The internet can be bad and good, she says, “but I just feel like it’s never really approached with nuance – it’s like, look at these vapid idiots on their phones. I wanted to approach it in a way where I didn’t judge the characters. Obviously they’re comedy characters, but I tried to look at all of them with empathy.”While it doesn’t offer full-on Marxist critique, I Love LA ponders the limits of the influencer economy, and the hidden costs of keeping up appearances. When we first meet Tallulah, she is living the high life – complete with an ill-gotten Balenciaga bag – but she is broke, her life online little more than social media smoke and mirrors. “Influencers are being sent a bunch of free merch, but maybe they can’t pay rent,” says Sennott. “I’m not saying they have the worst problems of anyone in the world. But part of what we wanted to show is that everyone is trying to present as doing better than they actually are, and pull back the curtain.”Varietypondered why we don’t actually see the content that Tallulah makes on screen, but Sennott didn’t think it was necessary. “No one wants to watch 30 minutes of someone editing a TikTok,” she says. Besides, “you see [Odessa] walk on camera and you go, yeah: that’s an It-girl! She just carries the charisma. I’m like, I don’t give a shit if she’s selling tinned fish or if she has a podcast!”View image in fullscreenRachel Sennott and Ayo Edebiri in Bottoms.Photograph: Courtesy of ORION Pictures Inc.As well as its on-the-ball observations, I Love LA is fabulously funny, often spit-out-your-coffee absurd, and has a lot of heart to boot. Picking out hilarious moments is tough – because there are so many – but the unmasking of an influencer as a “prison nepo baby” whose family used to own Rikers Island jail is high on the list, as is a meltdown that takes place to the sound of the much-memed All Star by Smash Mouth. In an episode inspired by a super-painful medical emergency that Sennott suffered in real life, Maia pretends to be Jewish to jump the queue at the hospital for “open-toe surgery”. Very Curb Your Enthusiasm, but also extremely Rachel Sennott, who has often been mistaken for being Jewish, perhaps fuelled by Shiva Baby (she is, in fact, from a Catholic family of Irish and Italian descent). Elsewhere, the friendship at the centre of the series is frequently toxic and codependent, but also steeped in the kind of picked-up-where-we-left-off warmth that only old friends can have. “I think you see the beauty of [Maia and Tallulah’s] relationship, too,” she says. “I hope it’s not just frenemies vibes!”The transition from film to TV was a learning curve, aided by the likes of Lorene Scafaria (Hustlers, Succession), who was an executive producer and directed two of the episodes. But it was a challenge that Sennott clearly rose to, along with the rest of the cast. “I could shout out every single person,” she beams. “There were no weak links. Everyone shines.” And, of course, she shines too, drawing on everything that has brought her to this moment to give a lead performance that’s as heartbreaking as it is side-splitting.How does she feel about the city that made it all possible? “I’ve been there for five years, which is when everyone says it starts to get fabulous – and goddamn is it fabulous!” she says. “So, yes – now I do love LA!”I Love LA is available on NOW in the UK, HBO in the US and HBO Max in Australia.Explore more on these topicsTelevisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

Not one, which is what you give something if you want to make the people who made it wince. Zero stars. All’s Fair, according to this newspaper, is a product entirely devoid of discernible worth. In the entire 204-year-old history of this publication, only 15 zero-star reviews have ever been written, and All’s Fair is so unremittingly awful it got one of them. These are the other 14, presented here as the Guardian’s Mount Rushmore of crap.Boat Trip, film review, 2002A notorious Cuba Gooding Jr comedy, and the first zero-star recipient in the history of this newspaper.What we saidPeter Bradshaw wrote: “Even the direst of recent teen-smut films have had a puppyish energy and an eagerness to please. But this? With its dated, clueless, unintentionally offensive gags about Swedish bimbos, like something from The Producers, only minus the laughs, it’s just living death.”Was it justified?Five years previously, Cuba Gooding Jr won an Oscar for his role in Jerry Maguire. Boat Trip was nominated for two Razzie awards and is widely thought to have negatively impacted his career.Fame Academy Live, concert review, 2003View image in fullscreenCould do better … the 2002 Fame Academy contestants.Photograph: Tim Whitby/PAThe seal well and truly broken, it took only six months for another review to reach the same giddy depths – this time for a live concert spin-off of a BBC talent show.What we saidAlexis Petridis wrote: “This concert could be no more efficient in parting parents from their cash if the Fame Academy students leapt from the stage and started snatching wallets at knifepoint.”Was it justified?Fame Academy limped on for a second series after this, before being axed.The Vines, concert review, 2003Just a week after the Fame Academy concert we gave a third zero-star review, as a then red-hot Australian rock band took to the stage of the Astoria in London.What we saidDavid Peschek wrote: “[Singer Craig] Nicholls is cast as the tortured lightning rod for a generation’s pain, so he sprawls on the floor and screams into the mic almost constantly. But this is not pain, it is a simulacrum of pain offering neither visceral thrills, insight, poetry nor catharsis. It is like watching a tantrum.”Was it justified?The band have released a further six albums since their 2002 debut, none of which captured the public imagination like they did in their early-00s heyday.Big and Rich, Horse of a Different Color, album review, 2004A country album by a duo comprising singer Big Kenny and the bassist from Lonestar, featuring songs such as Kick My Ass and Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy). The only album ever given zero stars by the Guardian.What we saidDavid Peschek (again) wrote: “Like the Bush twins at the MTV awards, this is arch-conservatism in a half-hearted search for cool. Big? Almost certainly and hence, quite probably, rich too. Not, by any means, clever.”Was it justified?Big and Rich won a Billboard Music award in the same year as this review; they have since been nominated for three Grammys and 17 Academy of Country Music awards.Martin Creed, concert review, 2004View image in fullscreen‘An experiment in charmlessness’ … Turner prize-winning artist Martin Creed turns his hand to music.Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The GuardianA gig by the British artist who had won the Turner prize three years previously.What we saidAlexis Petridis (again) wrote: “This show is provocative only in that it seems less like a gig than an experiment to see how charmless and pleased with himself a man can appear before the audience storm the stage and physically attack him.”Was it justified?In 2017, Lyn Gardner reviewedanother of Creed’s concertsfor the Guardian. She awarded it four stars and called it “endearing, exposing, ticklish and so totally unassuming that it’s hard to resist”.Oscar Wilde, theatre review, 2004One week later, equalling the record set the year previously, came a zero-star review of a play written by former Radio 1 DJ Mike Read.What we saidElisabeth Mahoney wrote: “The radio microphones, especially that of Peter Blake playing Oscar, are giving out only horribly patchy sound. We hear cast members speaking off stage. We endure duets where one singer is at full volume, while the other has no amplification at all. As this grim evening continues, you begin to wonder whether the sound system is being affected by the hefty rumbling of Oscar Wilde turning in his grave.”Was it justified?Oscar Wilde closed after this, its debut performance. That makes it far less successful than Cliff, Read’s 2003 musical about Cliff Richard, which ran for three full months.X Factor Live, concert review, 2005The following year, the Guardian reviewed a live version of the first series of ITV talent showThe X Factor.What we saidHelen Pidd wrote: “There are few experiences in cultural life that can shake one’s faith in the basic good of humanity, but sitting among 10,000 free-willed citizens who have paid £23.50 to watch blood-draining, pulse-stopping karaoke just about does it.”Was it justified?The X Factor’s television audience would increase to a peak of 19.4 million viewers by 2010, before contracting until it was axed in 2018.Peter Pan el Musical, theatre review, 2008After a three-year zero-star absence, along came a Spanish-language retelling of JM Barrie’s beloved book, presented with English subtitles.What we saidLyn Gardner wrote: “The show’s publicity proudly announces that one million Spaniards have seen this show, which just goes to prove that there is no accounting for statistics.”Was it justified?The musical ran in the UK for 36 performances. None of the British reviews were particularly kind.It Had to Be You, theatre review, 2010After a two-year gap came a revival of Renée Taylor and Joe Bologna’s 1981 romantic comedy.What we saidLyn Gardner (again) wrote: “‘I have no talent,’ cries Vito as he considers giving up his career and becoming a full-time writer. It’s clearly not going to stop him or the deluded Theda, and it clearly didn’t stop the writers of this painfully contrived piece of wish-fulfilment.”Was it justified?The play is still being performed around the world today, although reviews tend to be mixed.Valkee 2, technology review, 2014Four years later, a first: the only zero-star technology review doled out by the Guardian, for a device that claimed to cure seasonal affective disorder by shining light into your ear canals.What we saidSamuel Gibbs wrote: “None of the peer-reviewed studies listed in Valkee’s ‘science summary’ appears to be conducted without a conflict of interest with the company that produces the light headsets, having at least one of Valkee’s founders on each of the research teams.”Was it justified?Valkee filed for bankruptcy in 2021.The Greasy Strangler, film review, 2016‘Crams in every deviant activity you couldn’t begin to imagine …’Almost a decade and a half after Peter Bradshaw awarded a film zero stars, a second contender enters: an American comedy horror directed by Jim Hosking.What we saidWendy Ide wrote for the Observer: “This aggressively inane horror comedy manages to cram in every disgusting, deviant activity you couldn’t begin to imagine. And yet, it’s still rather boring.”Was it justified?Jordan Hoffmanalso reviewedThe Greasy Strangler in this newspaper, and described it as a “relentless monstrosity of a film … rife with fetishised cellulite, disgusting food and firehose penises.” He awarded it four stars.Love Island, TV review, 2021The seventh season of ITV’sjuggernaut reality show, and the second to be broadcast following the death of its original host, Caroline Flack.What we saidLucy Mangan wrote: “I hate myself as much as I love Faye, Kaz and Hugo and love it as much as I hate the rest and the whole retrograde stink of it.”Was it justified?Love Islandis still being broadcast, although it attracts half the audience it did in 2021.Sex: Unzipped, TV review, 2021View image in fullscreenAgonising … Sex: Unzipped.Photograph: NetflixNetflix’s “celebration of sexual health and positivity”, hosted by rapper Saweetie and featuring Romesh Ranganathan, Katherine Ryan and some puppets.What we saidLucy Mangan (again) wrote: “Saweetie is, especially for someone used to performing … uncomfortable, self-conscious and with a relentlessly flat delivery – it’s quite agonising. Perhaps she would be better off without the sex-positive puppets?”Was it justified?Sex: Unzipped has a 60% Rotten Tomatoes rating. It has not been renewed.Buying London, TV review, 2024A UK-based spin-off of Netflix’sSelling Sunset, following a band of high-end British estate agents.What we saidRebecca Nicholson wrote: “I hate that it makes Richard Curtis’s film Notting Hill look like a gritty documentary about the mean streets of London. I hate its England-for-dummies shtick that is clearly pitched at an international market. I hate its reverence for billionaires and bad taste, its celebrity name-dropping without actual celebrities, even the lurching drone footage that seems to have been shot by the Red Arrows.”Was it justified?Buying London has a 14% Rotten Tomatoes rating.

Why were they all so useless at the round table, though? Read on …Phil HarrisonWed 5 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 11.12 ESTShare‘Why is it always me? I’ve always got to do the dirty work for these traitors. I’m surprised they haven’t got me up in that turret with a hoover!” Yes, it is always you, Alan Carr. And most people watching The Celebrity Traitors wouldn’t have it any other way. But even aside from observing Carr’s ascent to national treasure status, The Celebrity Traitors has felt like a timely national bonding experience from start to finish. Elon Musk is adamant that civil war in the UK is inevitable. Sorry, Elon, but not during The Celebrity Traitors it isn’t. We’re all too busy watching Celia Imrie screech into a well.So what have we learned? The Celebrity Traitors has, of course, been a very different experience from its civilian iteration. On the most basic level, it has felt easier to pick a favourite and root for them. And, while £100,000 is a lot of money to someone on the national median wage, it’s pocket change to the likes of Stephen Fry and Jonathan Ross. Of course, the celebrity winner(s) aren’t getting the dosh anyway, with the winnings going to charity – but in any case, there has been a strong sense that this has been entirely about the fun parlour game rather than the winning.Initially, this lack of jeopardy – plus the fact that most of these people already knew, or at leastknew of,each other – made the roundtables somewhat frustrating. No one, more’s the pity, pretended to be Welsh. No one hid their real occupation, because how could they? Admitting to being an actor in the normie Traitors would be a death wish. Here, you couldn’t move for luvvies. There was no ganging up, no confrontation, barely any real intent at all. “We like each other too much,” said David Olusoga, at one point. “This has been our weakness.”View image in fullscreenTalk of the devil … Jonathan Ross.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio LambertAccordingly, while stars have been born (hello, Cat Burns), pre-existing celebrity hierarchies have, without doubt, spilled over into the game. There was much talk about unconscious racial bias when Niko Omilana and Tameka Empson were the first two celebrities to be banished. But arguably a likelier explanation was that they simply weren’t famous enough. After all, it’s easier to launch a witch-hunt against some prankster bloke from YouTube than against National Treasure and Designated Genius Stephen Fry.This, however, has become less of a problem as the game has gone on. There’s been a realisation that no one is ever really that honest with most of these people – and particularly not in public. Therefore, while the air of unforced and genuine conviviality has been a vicarious pleasure, the mildly catty moments – such as Carr’s muttered “Yabba dabba don’t!” when Jonathan Ross rocked up at breakfast seemingly dressed as Fred Flintstone – have been genuinely cherishable; the sound of bubbles gently popped.The sheer ineptitude on display has been staggering – and oddly endearing. In this celebrity version of the show, it’s become clear that overt analytical intelligence won’t get anyone very far. David Olusoga’s torturous circular monologues have been so consistently misguided that you actually began to retrospectively doubt the veracity of his highly regarded documentaries (imagine overthinking things to the point that you’re left suspecting the most obviously faithful faithful in Traitors history, Nick Mohammed). Stephen Fry generally hemmed and hawed like Bagpuss’s Professor Yaffle before eventually nominating David Olusoga again. And Kate Garraway – a literal news journalist, lest we forget – frequently blundered around like someone trying to burst a birthday piñata during a bomb disposal operation. “Kate Garraway repeating things” has become something of a meme since the show began.In the absence of anything of use from the show’s much-vaunted brains trust, it’s been left to a rugby player to get things done. This too, has been revealing. For all of his charm, there is, you suspect, very little air-kissing and insincere flattery in Joe Marler’s world, and that’s been his greatest asset. He’s come from a different professional arena to anyone else on the show: an unsentimental place of teamwork, mutual accountability, hard knocks and intense competitiveness. He’s probably the only faithful who has truly treated The Celebrity Traitors like a game and winning as the objective.The era of the reality show as a celebrity-hazing ritual was dying. Celebrity Traitors is another nail in its coffinBut really, the fun has been in the taking part – which isn’t something any professional sportsperson worth their salt would say. At times, the series has felt like a series of subliminal extended interviews – the sneakiest, cleverest chatshow imaginable. We’ve learned more about the underlying characters of these people from sitting and watching them eating lasagne and gossiping together than from a career’s-worth of magazine profiles. The era of the reality show as a celebrity-hazing ritual was dying anyway. But The Celebrity Traitors feels like another nail in its coffin.Given the certainty that similarly impressive names will be clamouring to appear on the next edition, the biggest problem for the producers will be selection. The balance here – between young and old, between familiar and up-and-coming, between sensible and silly – has been perfect. The civilian series have suggested it, but the celebrity version has confirmed it: this is one of the most immaculate small-screen entertainment formats ever devised. Parting, as kindred spirits Alan Carr and William Shakespeare would say, will be such sweet sorrow.The Celebrity Traitors final is on Thursday on BBC One at 9pm.Explore more on these topicsThe TraitorsTelevisionReality TVClaudia WinklemanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Living through that period has felt like moving further and faster into the future that their songs often sounded so worried about. Animal-borne diseases and invading armies, bomb shelters and endless rainstorms, falling skies and collapsing infrastructure – ’twas all foretold in the lyric sheets of the ever-fretfulThom Yorke.His reputation as a soothsayer has probably been overstated as the band’s myth has grown in their absence, but if the frontman is a genius (the jury is still out and may never come back in, their verdict deferred more by politics than musicianship) then he’s hardly the only monumental talent in the lineup. For all the brilliant records Yorke has made lately, including several with bandmate Jonny Greenwood intheir looser-limbed trio the Smile,the faithful have been holding out a geological age to see the full five back together.Radiohead’s 2025 tour: the opening night setlistRead moreNow, without much warning, nor any particular reason, nor any new music to sell us (that we know of), they have returned to playshort residencies in a few European cities. Performing in the round, they take and switch positions behind a gossamer projection screen that initially seems like some kind of shield. As it turns out, no such protection is needed. This is not a fragile re-emergence.“Shell smashed, juices flowing,” sings Yorke on opener Let Down, and it makes sense that they would start again with that one. A deep cut fromOK Computerthat has long been a fan favourite, its recent adoption by teens on TikTok gave the band their closest thing to a big hit this century. Gorgeous, oddly weightless, gently self-mocking – Yorke’s mordant joking about his own tendency towards maudlin “drivel” might be as under-recognised as Kafka’s – it strikes a peculiar note of hope-against-doubt, bequeathed from gen X to gen Z.On this outing, the shimmer of the vocal and Greenwood’s curious guitar melody (played in a different time signature to the other instruments) are given colossal oomph by an almost overpowering rhythm section. This sets the tone for the night, too, as the top end sometimes suffers from the cavern effect common to arenas of this size, while drummer Phil Selway, auxiliary percussionist Chris Vatalaro, and Jonny’s bassist brother Colin compensate with a stunning show of force on mid-to-late career tracks 2+2=5, Bloom and Ful Stop.The elder Greenwood has always been Radiohead’s secret weapon, his manner suggesting the offer of a nice cuppa while his playing can range from loverman soulfulness to borderline brutality. His basslines have walked the listener through the most forbidding passages of their studio material and tonight’s selections from Kid A – Everything In Its Right Place, Idioteque – complete their 25-year transition from icy sonic shocks to crowd-pleasing, floor-filling heaters.By 15 Step even the upper tiers of seated sections are bouncing like babies to those tricky drum patterns while Yorke reminds them that “it comes to us all”, whatever “it” is. Old age … or death, most likely. Yorke is almost 60 now and spry as hell, but also grey-bearded as a sea dog while he dances little jigs around the deck to The National Anthem and its stupidly great bassline, which he apparently wrote when he was 16.Radiohead play career-spanning set in first concert since 2018Read moreYorke has always kept one eye on the prancing spectres of elders like Mick Jagger, and one ear out for the sound of legacy acts spinning their wheels. That is absolutely not how Radiohead come across here. Their fanbase is more prone to purism and perversity than others, maybe, and some will inevitably quibble about the relative lack of choice picks from albums A Moon Shaped Pool or The Bends, though beloved early-ish single Fake Plastic Trees “blows through the ceiling” on that line much more explosively than on the recorded version.In the past, live performance has expressed Radiohead’s clear relief at being out of the studio, and alleviated of the compositional pressure that seemed to almost wreck them every time. Their energy tonight might mean something else, but the relief is surely felt by anyone who ever loved this band – it’s not just fun, it’s an absolute joy. Yorke, for his part, says little other than “gracias”. There are many who feel he should have said a lot more, anda lot louder, in recent years. And there are others who remember well the nervy young guy who seemed so freaked out by the speed and direction of our supposed progress back in the early days of the iMac, who would still elect him as the very fellow to sing to us in our present state of terminal velocity.The setlistLet Down2 + 2 = 5Sit Down.

She discusses sexism, success and why she won’t be stripping off on social mediaWed 5 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 08.20 ESTShareFamke Janssen is dressed for her photoshoot at the Covent Garden hotel exactly as her character, Betty, would dress in the new Netflix crime drama Amsterdam Empire – lacy and floral but tailored and mini, with long school socks. Is the look sexy in a sardonic way, or irony expressed through fashion? We spend a lot of time, one way or another, talking about objectification, the beauty myths of the patriarchy, the collateral damage of the self – sexism, basically. Janssen has been in more than 60 films across a 30-year career, and before that, she was a model. There’s a lot to talk about.So it hardly seems the time to mention how smoking she looks; her face as flawless and cheekboney at 60 as it was nearly 30 years ago, in the 1995James Bondfilm GoldenEye. It’s almost unnerving – if she were a man, I would mention it without hesitation. She puts it down to clean living: “I get judged very quickly, that I must have had work, which I haven’t. We shame women into it, and then we shame women when they do it. I support everyone’s decision to do whatever they want, it’s just not my cup of tea.”I look strong, I am strong. I come from a background of strong womenAmsterdam Empire is the first production she has ever made in her home country, the Netherlands, and the first time she has acted in Dutch. Roles have come up in the past, not least because she has two sisters in the business – Marjolein Beumer, an actor, and Antoinette Beumer, a director – but nothing was quite right. “Then Netflix came to me with this pitch – it’s The War of the Roses [the 1989 film rather than the historical to-do] meets The Sopranos,” she says. OK, yes and no: that’s definitely the story – Jack, played by Jacob Derwig, is the kingpin of a cannabis empire that is legal on the surface but not beneath. He kicks off the series by walking out on Betty, a show-stopping beauty and one-hit-wonder pop star of yore, who will absolutely not go down without a fight.It’s a new era for Netflix: if they make a show in a different territory, it’s authentic to that place. Amsterdam Empire feels very original, without template. The dialogue is exhilaratingly blunt. It’s raunchy but so frank and un-euphemised that, even while watching the divorce play out in a strip club, on a bucking bronco in the shape of a giant penis, you’re not remotely reminded of sex.View image in fullscreenNot going down without a fight … Janssen, right, with Jacob Derwig in Amsterdam Empire.Photograph: NetflixBut the beating heart is the subtle shift of allegiance – Betty enters the show as an eccentric who has been cast aside, while Jack’s the romantic hero with a new love interest. She’s the one who steadily, and completely, wins the room. “We know nothing about Betty,” Janssen says; “we know everything about Jack. So I said, ‘It’s not a fair fight.’ The fact that Betty doesn’t have a child, she doesn’t have a family member. She doesn’t have a friend. She has a dog that she has to steal, and she has her husband. When I read that character, I thought: ‘OK, I will do what I can to make this well-rounded. If I don’t get it on the page, I’m going to put it in my acting.” In many ways, it’s the job she was born to do – “I’ve made a career out of playing women who are underwritten.”Janssen was born in Amstelveen, near Amsterdam, into a hardscrabble existence that she describes quite elliptically but doesn’t gloss. “From a young age, we were left to fend for ourselves,” she says. “There were a lot of things going on, there was drama. I realised, if I don’t look after myself, this isn’t going to end well.” She was considered the intellectual one of the three sisters, so wasn’t encouraged to do anything creative, and ended up studying economics, “because I had a science teacher, who said to the class, to everyone, ‘Oh, girls don’t understand science.’ A whole few years of my life were derailed, just to prove this man wrong.”She started work young, taking any job she could find – delivering newspapers, working in bars, in shops, “anything to earn my own money, to have my own freedom”. She left home at 17, to become a model, and “it was only leaving the Netherlands, coming to the US, that I learned to dream, learned to create what I wanted to create. It was a whole different culture, where I had permission.”View image in fullscreen‘I was very aware of the pitfalls of being a model-turned-actor-turned-Bond girl’ … Janssen photographed in London.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianWhen you look at pictures of those modelling days – there’s aswimwear shootwith Janssen and Elle Macpherson that is so quintessentially 80s it’s like time-travelling – there is something culturally contradictory about them. The look was incredibly strong. This was before “heroin chic” and waifery; the archetype was physically robust, yet at the same time, there seemed to be an unspoken rule of, “Please, nobody ask these women to say anything, they’re better when you just look at them.”“For me,” she says, “that’s been the biggest challenge, because I’m so strong. I look strong, I am strong. I come from a background of strong women. I’m not going to play some idiot in front of a male producer or director to get what I want. But I feel that might be the way some people would go about it – because otherwise, if you go in too hard there, you know you’re being labelled at every turn, and you don’t get anything.”Janssen needed to put clear blue water between the modelling and her acting ambitions, and went to Columbia University in New York to study creative writing and literature, with film studies as a minor. She didn’t get her first acting role until she was 28, and then GoldenEye came along in 1995, when she was 30. Xenia Onatopp was, perhaps, not an obvious choice of role. “I was very aware,” she says, “of the pitfalls of being a model-turned-actor-turned-Bond girl. I thought ‘Bond girl’ was such a demeaning term. But I thought: ‘I have nothing to lose; if I do this, I’m going to go all the way.’ So I came up with a lot of the things that are now in the film, because I wanted to make a memorable character, not play her the way she was written.”Onatopp has been so deeply analysed, not just as a moment of Bond girl resurgence in the franchise – a move away from interchangeable damsels towards women who could crush you with their thighs, and whose only distress would be if they laddered their tights – but also for what, if any, statement it made about feminism as dominance, sadism as a baton passing from the male to the female. It got a bit heated, put it that way. Surely Onatopp was always written as a woman who gets off on thigh-crushing men to death?View image in fullscreen‘This time, Mr Bond, the pleasure will be all mine’ … Janssen as Xenia Onatopp in GoldenEye.Photograph: Eon Productions/United Artists/Allstar“I brought a lot that was not on the page,” says Janssen. “Things like the way she’s so orgasmic. I grew up on Bond movies, because my dad used to like them, and so I always thought of them as comedies, as tongue-in-cheek. I thought: ‘Let me make this character unforgettable.’ I went for broke. It easily could have failed. I don’t know where I got the confidence.”It was a success, no question – but the knock-on effect was that “after that, the offers that were coming in were any woman with a gun, standing around. Between my name, Famke Janssen, and having played a Russian, Xenia Onatopp, they didn’t know what to do with me except make me a foreigner who was bad.”It wasn’t what she wanted, and she fought instead to get a part that genuinely wasn’t very large, in the 1997 neo-noir City of Industry, starring Harvey Keitel. “It’s an American woman. She works in a supermarket. She has no money. She lives in this shitty little house. It took a lot to get that part, because Harvey initially just saw this glamorous person, with my background – well-travelled, whatever. He didn’t see me, he sawthis.”She gestures at herself, and of course I know what she means – star-power personified.“And I thought: ‘But that’s not my background.’ I came to the audition dressed like a checkout girl, thinking: don’t judge a book by its cover, let me go for this, it’s interesting.”View image in fullscreen‘Obviously, in the late 80s as a model, the 90s as an actor, I’ve seen things.’Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianFrom there, she went on to small-to-middling parts in left-field or breakout movies, not always (but very often) with sterling directors, Robert Altman (in 1998’s The Gingerbread Man) andWoody Allen(in Celebrity, the same year) among them. “I wanted to use this moment that I had after GoldenEye to go against type, make less money, not become famous. Just become known as someone who showed up and could do different things, play different characters.”She’s very complimentary about Allen, which feels like a blast from the past, as nobody talks about him now except in conjunction with the allegation that surrounds him (which he has always denied).“I thought, having watched so many Woody Allen movies, that he would tell people to act a certain way, because most of his leading actors become a version of Woody Allen,” she says. “But it doesn’t work like that at all. He says very little. He lets people do what they want to do. And if he doesn’t like it, he just fires them and replaces them with someone else. We always had this feeling that we might be next.” It sounds kind of Stalinist. “He’s not a tyrant. Soon-Yi seemed like she was wearing the pants.” (Soon-Yi was, of course, the adopted daughter of Mia Farrow; Allen had been in a relationship with Farrow for 12 years, until he left her for Soon-Yi in 1992.)There’s a lot in here – there were allegations that Allen sexually assaulted his daughter, Dylan, but charges were never brought after two investigations cleared him, plus counter-allegations that Farrow was abusive, which Farrow says “were completely made up”. The whole situation with Soon-Yi was widely considered so icky by the late 90s (she was 21 when they got together, he in his mid-50s) that it was safer just to back away from the whole situation and never mention Allen again. Which is all relevant to Janssen in so far as she genuinely doesn’t care how things sound – she just says what she sees.“Obviously, in the late 80s as a model, the 90s as an actor, I’ve seen things. I’ve seen people enable things. Harvey Weinstein would never have gone on for as long as he did without the people around him.” She made movies with Weinstein but was never harassed by him. “I think people would never dare, with me.” What, because you’re tall? “I’m tall, I’m outspoken, I don’t fall for that type of behaviour. I’m not blaming any victims in this situation, but yes, I was unscathed in those areas.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m excited that I was part of it’ … Janssen as Dr Jean Grey, with James Marsden as Scott Summers, in X-Men: The Last Stand (2006).Photograph: 20th Century Fox/AllstarOf course, you don’t actually have to have been sexually assaulted to have been diminished by the sexist standards of this era. Janssen made two films with Jon Favreau, Love and Sex (2000) and Made (2001); whenhe gaily saidin an interview about her that, “It’s very rare to see someone who’s beautiful and funny,” it was accepted that was just the kind of thing cool guys said. “Look at the 1920s, the 30s,” Janssen says, a bit resignedly. “All those beautiful women in screwball comedies were geniuses. People are just largely not aware of the sexism that’s prevailing in our lives. We take things for granted, when we shouldn’t.”In 2000 came the role of Dr Jean Grey in X-Men, which would go on for years, though later only as a cameo. “Until X-Men, everything [in superhero films], from production design to costume design to the performances, had been very glossy and unrealistic. And X-Men changed that. I’m actually excited that I was part of it, and it gave me all this work.“In the end, it’s a business,” she continues. “It’s not that I wouldn’t love to dabble in only my favourite projects with my favourite directors and actors, but it doesn’t work like that. Unless I have some type of relevance, which I think I’ve pushed to the limit by remaining out of the press for as long as I have, I won’t get work.”She stays off social media because she finds it a bit unseemly: “I certainly was not going to do what a lot of the rest of the world and a lot of women seem to be doing, which is photographing themselves half naked on Instagram, screaming for attention. It’s just not who I am.” She thinks, maybe rightly, that she’d be in hotter demand if she had more of a profile. But, as a counterpoint, I think if we’d known these past 30 years how straight-talking she was, we’d have been bugging her for an answer to everything.Amsterdam Empire is streaming on NetflixThis article was amended on 5 November 2025 to remove some text for editorial reasons.Explore more on these topicsFilmSuperhero moviesWoody AllenJames BondTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Jakub Hrůša’s conducting draws out the music’s colours and the cast are uniformly strongErica JealWed 5 Nov 2025 10.40 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Nov 2025 10.42 ESTShareThe director Katie Mitchell recently announced that after nearly 30 years she was stepping back from opera. With this staging of Leoš Janáček’s The Makropulos Case – remarkably, a first for the Royal Opera – she’s going out with a bang.A reason Mitchell gave for her decision was misogyny, in both the business of opera and its material. She has addressed the second before here in Covent Garden productions, tweaking the stories of Donizetti’s Lucia di Lammermoor and Handel’s Theodora to give their heroines agency. You might think that’s not something that Elina Makropulos needs: after all, Janáček’s heroine has been alive since 1585, reinventing herself in every generation – always as an opera star, always with the initials EM – so she’s seen everything, and isn’t afraid of anyone. Yet Mitchell is still able to reinvigorate her story – this time with both her expected merciless exposure of male bad behaviour and unexpected humour. It feels as if she is sticking up a middle finger at her naysayers and her reputation for onstage gloom. Who knew a Katie Mitchell production could be this funny?View image in fullscreenImperious yet not invulnerable …  Ausrine Stundyte as Emilia Marty with Sean Panikkar as Albert Gregor, in The Makropulos Case, Royal Opera House, 2025Photograph: Camilla GreenwellAs the orchestra tears into the overture, a huge smartphone screen appears above the set: here is Emilia Marty, her current pseudonym, in her hotel room on a dating app. She swipes right on Krista, who is “looking for something casual”, but who will a few hours later have committed murder and acquired a formula for the elixir of life. It’s Krista who is the fulcrum of Mitchell’s reinterpretation: she and her boyfriend Janek have turned thieves and Marty is the mark. Vicki Mortimer’s set creates first a chic present-day hotel, then a utilitarian backstage area, both with mirror frames through which we see the characters in moments of, literally, self-reflection.As so often in Mitchell’s productions, there are at least two scenes happening at once in neighbouring rooms – three if you count the phone screen – and it’s perhaps too easy to lose track of crucial details when there’s so much of interest going on. Sometimes, one feels the lack of stillness – and Marty’s final monologue happens in a section of the stage surely barely visible to a chunk of the audience – but the drama is convincingly acted and very well sung by a strong cast, including Heather Engebretson as Krista, Johan Reuter as overbearing Jaroslav Prus, Sean Panikkar as Gregor and Alan Oke as Hauk-Šendorf, whose reunion with his long-lost love is genuinely touching.At the centre of it all is a magnificent, magnetic performance fromAusrine Stundyteas Emilia Marty, imperious yet not invulnerable. Her voice soars above the orchestra even as Jakub Hrůša’s conducting draws out the deep contrasts and bright colours of Janáček’s score, given in an unbroken, 90-minute stretch. It’s an exhilarating evening; the opera world is going to miss Mitchell perhaps more than it realises.At theRoyal Opera House, London, until 21 November.Explore more on these topicsOperaRoyal Opera HouseClassical musicLeoš JanáčekreviewsShareReuse this content"

The maths is often complex – but the rule of thumb has always been that the benefit equates to about 20% of each production’s budget.View image in fullscreenFor Love or Money had a budget of £4.3m and claimed tax credits of £994,353 – or 23% of the budget – accounts filed with Companies House suggest.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockSo, if a producer wants to make a small film with a UK budget of £1m, they should be entitled to about £200,000 in tax credits. Once they have provided the necessary costs and invoices, film-makers can claim that benefit as cash, before their film has even been released.The story of Latham’s moviemaking seems to involve him fully embracing this scheme, all of which is set out in the public accounts of each of the films’ holding companies.For example, For Love or Money had a budget of £4.3m and claimed tax credits of £994,353 – or 23% of the budget – accounts filed with Companies House suggest. So the sums roughly add up, yes? Well, maybe not. If you actually sit through the 95 minutes of the film, you might ask if the product really cost that much, given its budget feel and the calibre of the script.There are some documents that add weight to such scepticism. The Guardian has seen a spreadsheet of the film’s budget – which contains enough detail to list parking tickets issued to crew members. It also includes hundreds of lines of other costs, such as payments to cast members and a £100,000 fee to Latham, before recording the “grand total” of the film’s budget to be £1.3m. Oddly, that is £3m short of the figure recorded in the published accounts.Separate records from Lloyd’s of London, also seen by the Guardian, appear to show the film was insured based on “estimated gross production costs” of £1.4m. These much smaller figures imply a tax credit due of up to £280,000 – nowhere near the almost £1m of taxpayer support that Companies House accounts set out was claimed – raising questions as to whether the state assistance was almost four times too rich.Gatecrash contains the same subplot. The publicly filed accounts imply a total budget of about £4.5m with claimed tax credits of £868,324 (so, about 19% of the “budget”). Yet one internal document seen by the Guardian – which details costs such as hire fees for “costumes” plus “hair/make up & prosthetics kit” – sets out how the Gatecrash budget totalled £1m. If the document is correct, it would suggest this film was also largely paid for by the exchequer.There is a similar story around Dark Encounter, where the accounts appear to show a £6.6m budget and £1.3m of claimed tax credits. Yet, confusingly, the film’s director, Carl Strathie, has suggested that he was working under much tighter financial constraints, posting on X in 2024 that the budget for the film was only £1.5m.Strathie also stated that another of his films made with Latham – the sci-fi thriller Solis that starred The Walking Dead actor Steven Ogg – cost £700,000 to make and included cost savings such as the spaceship set having pilot seats that were “gaming chairs … put into MDF frames”. That film, which only featured Ogg on screen, was paid £970,000 by the taxpayer on a £5m budget, according to the publicly filed accounts.View image in fullscreenThe film director Carl Strathie on set.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyIf those numbers at Companies House are correct, that appears to have made Solis more costly than a comparable film in the same genre: Sony Pictures’ 2009 low-budget sci-fi film Moon starred the future Oscar winner Sam Rockwell plus the voice of double Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey as an artificial intelligence character. Itcost a reported $5m(£3.8m).Strathie did not respond when approached for comment via his accountants but both of his social media posts appear to have been taken down since the Guardian began asking questions about Latham’s financing.What does remain on the record, however, is how much one of Strathie’s films took at the box office. Dark Encountergrossed a total of $4,672, seemingly exclusively from the United Arab Emirates, according to IMDb.com’s takings analysis service, Box Office Mojo. Meanwhile, none of For Love or Money, Gatecrash or Solis get a mention for box office takings.An unsatisfactory ending?So if the real intrigue in a Latham film is contained within its finances, has anybody tried to account for the apparent discrepancies?In order to be able to keep film tax credits after they have been paid out, a final certificate needs to have been granted by the British Film Institute (BFI). Yet, neither For Love or Money, Gatecrash, Dark Encounter nor Solis have received one,according to the BFI. Meanwhile, Gatecrash Film Ltd – the company behind the picture of the same name – never will get its certificate, having been dissolved in September 2025.A spokesperson for the BFI said: “The BFI has a legal gateway through which we can share information regarding compliance with HMRC and DCMS, and we work closely with them to uphold the integrity of the system.”HMRC did not comment.All of which appears to leave filmgoers with an unsatisfactory finale: if Latham really is the most prolific UK film producer you’ve never heard of, he is also one you never hear from.The Guardian attempted to contact him directly in order to seek comment, as well as via his family and his lawyers. The producer did not respond.Explore more on these topicsFilm industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Both were directed by Stephen Sommers, and the second film also saw the screen acting debut of Dwayne Johnson as a second villain, the Scorpion King; this character receivedits own set of spin-off films, of which five so far have been made, though only the first, The Scorpion King in 2002, featured Johnson.Maria Bello replaced Weisz as Carnahan in the third Mummy film,Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, released in 2008, while a “reboot” Mummy film, directed byAlex Kurtzmanand starring Tom Cruise and Annabelle Wallis, was released in 2017 as the start ofUniversal’s so-called Dark Universe; however its poor box office returns and negative reviews resulted in the studio abandoning plans to continue the series.The unexpected success of a 25th-anniversary rereleaseof the first The Mummy saw it break into the top 20 films at the North American box office in April 2024.Fraser, meanwhile, is riding a major career comebackon the strength of his Oscar-winning performance in The Whale.Explore more on these topicsFilmRachel WeiszThe MummyHorror filmsAction and adventure filmsUniversal PicturesnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s like we’re not even supposed to be angry. But I could eat this podium with a fork and fucking knife, I’m so angry.”Stewart spent eight years trying to get her passion project – an adaptation of Lidia Yuknavitch’s 2011 memoir, The Chronology of Water – off the ground. The film, which stars Imogen Poots,premiered at Cannes in Mayand is shortly to be released in the US.Stewart began her speech crediting Yuknavitch as a key inspiration and saying her memoir gave “voice to certain truths I inherently understood”.“Hard truths, when spoken out loud, become springboards to freedom,” Stewart said. “The permission to be unpalatable, unsanitary, and to come from the inside out … led me to acknowledge the invisible cage that we are all living in and how easy it is to story our way out there.”Stewart said that women’s voices appeared to have gained more traction since #MeToo, but that the industry was still afraid of unsanitised stories. “I can now attest to the bare-knuckle brawling that it takes every step of the way when the content is too dark, too taboo,” she said. “Our business,” she continued, “is in a state of emergency.“We are allowed to be proud of ourselves,” said Stewart. “But let’s try not to be tokenised. Let’s start printing our own currency.”“I am so for you,” she concluded. “I hope you are too. Let’s make art in the face of it.”Attendees at the event included Tessa Thompson, Kate Hudson, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Claire Foy, Kerry Condon, Patty Jenkins, and Emma Mackey. Also speaking at the forum was costume designer Ruth Carter, who in 2023 becamethe first black woman to win two Oscars.Carter paid tribute to her college professor, as well as the directors Spike Lee and John Singleton, “who gave me room to learn and grow – that’s what mentorship and fellowship do. They say to every woman film-maker and artist: We see you. We believe in you. You belong here.”In 2023, the number of women who directed the top-grossing US films declined slightly, from 18% to 16%, while in the UK, some 13% of directors of all films were women.In Europe, the number is believed to be a little higher, at around 23%, across all films.A study published last year founda “catastrophic” 10-year lowfor on screen female representation in film, with only 30 of the US’s top 100 films led or co-led by women, down from 44 in 2022.This was despite the $1.4bn success of Barbie, Greta Gerwig’s comedy starring Margot Robbie. This season, the two women who have previously won the best director Oscar – Chloé Zhao and Kathryn Bigelow, are believed to be frontrunners to take the prize again at next year’s ceremony, for their films Hamnet and A House of Dynamite.Explore more on these topicsKristen StewartFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

From 1963 to 1970, the group’s four members experienced an entirely new kind of fame, while leaning on each other to get through it. After splitting up, they faced another unprecedented challenge: how to be an ex-Beatle? This one had to be confronted alone.The heaviest burdens of expectation fell on the group’s main songwriters, John Lennon and Paul McCartney, who were also suffering from the emotional shock of an acrimonious personal split. Both of them leaned on their wives. As John and Yoko Ono pursued political campaigns and avant-garde art projects, Paul andLinda McCartneyretreated with their children to their ramshackle Scottish farm, where Paul licked his wounds, sheared sheep and tinkered with new songs. Paul insisted that Linda become his new musical partner, despite her inexperience. As she said later: “The whole thing started because Paul had nobody to play with. More than anything he wanted a friend near him.” The album he made with her, Ram, sold well but received savage reviews, deepening his crisis of confidence.McCartney yearned to play before audiences again, which he hadn’t since the Beatles stopped touring in 1966. But he couldn’t face doing it solo, the spotlight trained on him alone. So he asked Linda to help him put together a new group. This authorised, illustrated oral history, edited by cultural historian Ted Widmer, tells the story ofone of the most successful bands of the 1970s – and one of the strangest.It’s based on interviews (given for a new documentary on the band) with McCartney and former band members, as well as archive material. Widmer does an expert job of stitching this into a compelling narrative that includes cultural context – like what else was in the charts at the time – and plenty of photographs, many previously unseen. The result is a portal into a more eccentric age of pop, a fable about the tension between celebrity and creativity, and a story with elements of Spinal Tap and Wacky Races.The personnel of Wings varied over the decade around a core of Paul, Linda and Denny Laine, formerly of the Moody Blues. The group did not soar effortlessly to high altitude because of McCartney’s fame. In fact, determined to remake himself after the Beatles, he waged a kind of guerrilla campaign against his own celebrity. In 1972, he said: “A year ago, I used to wake up in the morning and think, I’mPaul McCartney. I’m a myth. And it scared the hell out of me.” The first Wings album, Wild Life, released in 1971, was almost deliberately half-baked, and arrived to another round of jeers.View image in fullscreenPaul and Linda McCartney on their Scottish farm.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesMcCartney then instigated one of the most bizarre episodes in the history of rock and pop, packing the other members of Wings into a battered van, along with his children and his sheepdog Martha, and driving them on an unplanned tour of British universities. He would look at the map, identify the nearest university, find the student union, and ask an open-mouthed social secretary if they fancied a gig that evening.For 50p, anyone who wanted could come and see Paul McCartney lead his new group through a ragged set of rock’n’roll covers, new Wings songs, and no Beatles songs. They stayed in grubby little hotels and bed and breakfasts, as if McCartney wanted to recreate the discomfit and squalor of his pre-fame tours with the Beatles. He said: “If we do it this way, the old-fashioned way from square one, there will come a day when we’ll be at square one hundred.”He also wanted Wings to make its mistakes away from the scouring gaze of critics, conscious, in particular, that they would give his wife no quarter. Linda was struggling to learn keyboard and vocal parts, duties she had accepted reluctantly. Her unpolished but affecting singing voice, which blends beautifully with those of Paul and Laine, is now recognised as a crucial component of the Wings sound. But at the time she was bullied and abused for her presumption, a victim of the peculiarly intense vituperation reserved for Beatles’ wives.McCartney, a more oddball artist than his reputation suggested, was a wayward decision-maker. His new group’s first two singles were a protest song (Give Ireland Back to the Irish) and a kids’ song (Mary Had a Little Lamb). He chose to record the band’s third album in Lagos, provoking two members of the group to quit. But despite getting mugged and having master tapes from the session stolen, the album Wings recorded there became the group’s most acclaimed and successful: Band on the Run.Paul McCartney: where to start in his solo back catalogueRead moreBy the middle of the decade, Wingshadreached square one hundred. In cultural memory, they are inevitably overshadowed by the Beatles, obscuring just how popular they were. Wings had more US No 1s than anyone except the Bee Gees. The Wings Over the World stadium tour of 1975-76 was huge, making the band one of the top-grossing live acts of the 70s. We can now appreciate how many of their songs are, to use the technical term, bangers: Band on the Run, Jet, Let ’Em In, Live and Let Die, to name a few.Wings Over the World was the zenith. After that things slowly subsided, commercially and musically, and the whole enterprise was more or less killed off in 1980 by McCartney’s attempt to take a large bag of cannabis into Japan, which landed him in prison and forced the cancellation of a tour. That was messy, but Wings was never neat. It had three different lead guitarists and four different drummers, and remained unbalanced by its lead singer’s outsize fame and talent. Under McCartney’s contrarian, impulsive, endlessly generative leadership, it blended imperial rock grandeur with a homemade ethos and a certain stoned nonchalance. Wings was always bound to be a spin-off from the Beatles universe – but what a spin-off it was.Ian Leslie is the author ofJohn & Paul: A Love Story in Songs(Faber).

You can understand why – unlike lust, anger or even sloth, it’s not something to admit to. In his Allegory with Venus and Cupid, Bronzino depicted envy as an ugly green hag, clutching her head and howling impotently; now Instagram has allowed anyone online to gain access to images of the lifestyles of those richer, prettier and luckier than ourselves.Ruth, the narrator of Harriet Lane’s third novel, Other People’s Fun, is corroded by it. Alone, her marriage over, her daughter grown and her freelance work as dull as it is low paid, she is that most dangerous of characters: an overlooked middle-aged woman with nothing to lose. When she bumps into beautiful, stupid and entitled Sookie at a school reunion, she reconnects with her teenage self “and all her violent desires”. Having flown under the radar as a pupil, noticed by Sookie only because she lent her her essays, she has perfect recall of her own petty humiliations, now amplified by the fact that she can stalk her contemporaries’ “best lives” on social media, while almost none of them remember her.“Are they spilling over with guile, or entirely lacking it? I am never sure. There they are, ceaselessly insisting on the fact of their existence, imagining someone might give a fuck about their dog, their children’s exam results, the Spanish Steps, a colander of blackberries on a wooden kitchen table … I lurk. I am the audience, transfixed, eyes shining in the darkness. After all, if someone wants to be seen, someone else must watch,” Ruth tells us.Lane’s two previous novels,Alys, AlwaysandHer, were elegant psychological thrillers revolving around toxic fascination between two women, one wealthier and seemingly more sophisticated than her intelligent but downtrodden foil. It’s the kind of fiction that Patricia Highsmith excelled at, or Zoë Heller in Notes on a Scandal, and a subgenre to which Lane has added layers of rage at being poor, powerless and almost invisible to the more fortunate.The fascination of Other People’s Fun is less its plot than its queasy portrait of stalking and manipulationIn Other People’s Fun, the prevailing mood is one of black comedy rather than menace. Ruth and Sookie are former contemporaries at a minor public school whose liberal ethos and complacent narcissism are reminiscent of Bedales (where Lane was a pupil). Decades later, the pretty people who once had eating disorders and kleptomania now own business empires which encompass “mindfulness festivals, forest bathing, organic skincare and a wellbeing podcast”. The only luxuries Ruth has are those that she shoplifts or steals from Sookie. Desperate to be seen, she’s like an Anita Brookner heroine on steroids. The clash between her resentful, sardonic intelligence and Sookie’s online self-satisfaction is deliciously uncomfortable, especially once Ruth realises that what her “friend” really wants is support to have an affair with their charismatic former teacher, Waxham, whom they both had a crush on as teenagers.Of course, Ruth offers Sookie her modest home in an unfashionable part of north London as a trysting place, and of course it will all go very wrong. The fascination of Other People’s Fun is less its plot than its queasy portrait of stalking and manipulation. Samuel Taylor Coleridge claimed that Iago in Othello had “motiveless malignancy” in his desire to destroy the noble Moor; Ruth’s envious hatred is, as she says, “all I’ve got in the tank right now”. Not that there is anything morally superior about her target. The contrast between the luxuries that Sookie takes for granted and our narrator’s struggle to survive as a low-paid translator of German marketing copy goes all the way back to boarding school, where “we were endlessly tumbled together like stones at the bottom of the sea. It knocked the corners off some of us, but some of us developed flint-sharp edges.”The best comedy is sharpened by pain, and what Lane has pinpointed in her flint-sharp novel is something that has a highly modern resonance as the world of the haves and have-nots becomes increasingly polarised and toxic. When Ruth gets her revenge, it is as nasty as it is total. You will, I fear, howl with satisfaction.Amanda Craig’s ninth novel, High & Low, is published next May by Abacus.

She had no idea she was 22 weeks pregnant, but doctors suspected she had had an abortion, then illegal in Argentina, and called the police. Belén was charged with aggravated homicide and sentenced to eight years in prison. When her case was taken up by feminist lawyer Soledad Deza it sparked protests, thousands taking to the streets in green scarves. This heartfelt drama tells the story, mostly from the perspective of lawyer Deza (played by the film’s director Dolores Fonzi).It begins in the hospital. The doctor in charge barely bothers to look up at Belén from his clipboard – she is a poor working-class woman and this will determine her fate. After a foetus is found in the hospital toilet, police arrive, handcuffing Belén to her bed. They do not carry out DNA tests on the foetus, so there is no physical evidence – a fact not raised by the blood-boilingly lazy defence at her trial. The real-life Belén has always chosen to remain anonymous, which might explain why her character takes a back seat here, though Camila Plaate’s sensitive supporting performance gives us a glimpse into Belén’s growing political awareness.The film is essentially a legal procedural: solid, mostly entertaining and occasionally gripping. It follows Deza and her team step by step as they battle the system to get Belén her appeal. As the case gathers pace, it takes over Deza’s waking hours, causing ripples of resentment in her family. It’s a reminder of expectations around work and home for women – it doesn’t matter how important your job is, missing your child’s violin recital will not be forgiven. The film ends on an absolute punch-the-air high with real-life footage on the streets in December 2020 when abortion in Argentina was legalised, faces filled with delight and tears of joy.Belén is in UK and US cinemas from 7 November and on Prime Video from 14 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsArgentinaAbortionWomenHealthAmericasreviewsShareReuse this content"

It seems to be the place on everyone’s lips, the megalopolis at the centre of contemporary conversation, endlessly and casually invoked as the epitome of heartless capitalism and reactionary politics, a city beyond irony or principled objection. And yet, until now, I don’t think I have seen a film try to show what this extraordinary place actually looks like, with woozy, dreamy, narcotically Ballardian and surreal images of this cityscape in the desert.Colossal Wreck, with its reference to Shelley that is made explicit at the end, is Appignanesi’s own wryly thoughtful account of his visit to Dubai in 2023, to present a screening ofhis previous film My Extinctionat the28th UN Climate Change Conference, or Cop28, which was, with staggering effrontery, being staged by a massive oil-producing nation whose politicians thought nothing of actually making discreet oil deals at the conference itself. The film is wonderfully written and mesmerically scored by composer Vik Sharma and narrated off camera by Appignanesi – or rather, it seems, by an AI voice clone. (I had thought that Appignanesi was speaking metaphorically about this fabrication of his speaking self but no, it is literal AI.) And so his physical presence, generally one of genial dishevelment, is largely absent, which has the result of increasing the film’s sense of seriousness.There werecalamitous flash-flood disasters in Dubaibefore and after the conference, but while Appignanesi was there everything was eerie perfection, an uncanny valley of hyper-prosperous consumerist placidity. Appignanesi is too discreet and high-minded to say it, but Dubai and its Expo City are, simply, film-making gold: everywhere you point your camera – or, for that matter, iPhone – presents an amazing spectacle. It is like a city-state-sized airport duty free shop crossed with a Kubrickian spaceship. Appignanesi introduces My Extinction and gamely participates in a Q&A afterwards to a modest audience. (He drolly records his resentment of the greater audience and industry support for Josh Tickell, another film-maker there.) And he also shows us an indigenous speaker from Brazil’s Guarani people, Valdelice Veron, speaking with passion about her people being wiped out, the documentary’s one moment of un-anaesthetised emotion.The film allows us to ponder the single, ridiculous subject: what on earth is everyone else doing here? The activists are massively outnumbered by the bankers and the fossil-fuel shills who are solemnly here to hide their raison d’etre in plain sight. The keynote is that floating, outer-space sensation of something very strange indeed: a message from the future. We see the vista of Dubai and its towers (Appignanesi calls them “gargantua of insignificance”) from the top of the world’s tallest building to the disquietingly beautiful accompaniment of whale song. Could something positive emerge, almost by accident, from this circus? Or is humanity more than half in love with its own extinction, addicted as it is to the business of living and using everything up? (I personally don’t think this is the case.) But this is Appignanesi’s best documentary yet.Colossal Wreck is in UK cinemas from 7 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsCop28DubaireviewsShareReuse this content"

For more than 200 years, the British Museum in London has proudly displayed the marbles – and done very decent educational and curatorial work while gradually registering awareness that this is stolen property. Lord Elgin effectively plundered these artefacts and his supposed purchase of them could hardly be seen as anything more than a bribe, especially as the permission document or “firman” from the then controlling Ottoman empire is missing and exists only in highly suspect manuscript translations. But no British politician wants to get involved, suspecting that it means nothing but trouble. Keir Starmer is very unlikely to hand his rightwing opponents a fresh new weapon in the culture war.Wilkinson entertainingly recounts Elgin’s arrogance and also puts before us the new context of museum restitution where institutions are restoring contested items, especially in Scotland, which leads the way in this movement. Campaigner and actor Brian Cox tells Wilkinson that if the marbles had found their way to Edinburgh and not London they would have gone back to Athens a long time ago. He could be right. Furthermore, there are new imaginative avenues of thinking: digital and virtual reality displays of the marbles and how they would have looked in the Acropolis could in theory be mounted at theBritish Museum.The director is also generous and open-minded in allowing the pro-British argument an airing: the suggestion that museum culture is international and it is regressive and nativist to bring the marbles over toGreece. Yet here is my one small complaint about this film; or rather, a question that isn’t asked or answered here. Given that the aesthetic point is so important, that these marbles were part of an artistic whole within the Acropolis, isn’t it disconcerting that they would not be reaffixed but simply placed in another museum near the Acropolis (and one that incidentally charges €20 a ticket, as opposed to free admission at the British Museum)? Well, for all that, this is a thoughtful and considered case for their homecoming.The Marbles is in UK and Irish cinemas from 7 NovemberExplore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsParthenon marblesBritish MuseumGreeceEuropeHeritagereviewsShareReuse this content"

Polly Maberly played Simon’s distant wife whose froideur partially sets the plot in motion. So while it’s easy to forget Maberly’s involvement in Muscle (honestly, the only thing I can remember about the film isFairbrass and the orgy scene), she gets to take centre stage here in this similarly weird, skewwhiff thriller, this time set in London. And while Odyssey doesn’t coalesce as satisfyingly as Muscle did, that’s not Maberly’s fault. A character actor whose credits include a lot of schlock TV, she gets to be extraordinary here, playing a brittle, funny, completely deluded screw-up whose life comes unravelled.Maberly plays Natasha Flynn, a small-time estate agent who runs an office with just two other employees, dweeby Spike (Charley Palmer Rothwell) and put-upon Safi (Kellie Shirley), plus new intern Dylan Rose (Jasmine Blackborow). Sometimes, Natasha sweet-talks her staff but more often than not she’s shouting at them, a capriciousness partly fuelled by her steadily increasing intake of cocaine. Completely fluent in the half-truth language of estate agentry, where small spaces are “cosy” and properties in the middle of nowhere are “rural”, Natasha worryingly believes her own lies, especially the one she tells herself about how the upcoming merger with another agency won’t be a takeover. In truth, the wheels are coming off her little toy wagon one by one; she owes money all over town, to old friends and loan sharks. She even owes money to the dentist’s surgery we see her skipping out of in the opening scene, without paying for a wisdom tooth removal.The setup is promising and some viewers may feel as if they’re being primed to expect a comeuppance for Natasha, especially since estate agents may be the only type of professional less popular than dentists. But instead the film takes a weird zigzag into Grand Guignol horror territory, when Natasha is compelled to assist in the kidnapping of another estate agent called Douglas Kelly (Ben Shafik), at the behest of a third, Dom (Daniel De Bourg), and keep Douglas tied up in a lonely property in Essex called Calypso Farm.That Homeric echo in the name of the farm may get you thinking that this is gearing up to be a sort of pastiche of theOdyssey– but no, there’s no going home for Natasha, only forward and deeper into a kind of demented madness. The bloody excess of the last act doesn’t feel earned or even very logical, but Maberly is so watchable and intense you can forgive the film its sins. It helps that Johnson gets such a substantial assist from the soundtrack, created by his brother Matt Johnson, best known for his band the The, who produces a pulsing, menacing electro-forward score.Odyssey is in UK cinemas from 7 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersCrime filmsLondonreviewsShareReuse this content"

The Slough-based dancer and choreographer has made pieces about domestic violence (Bird), sexuality (You&Me) and nonconformist women (Slut). She often works in consultation with community groups, drawing on the lives of marginalised and underrepresented women. Rooted in north Indian kathak dance, she has an unforced authority over her movement, a softness and certainty, that draws your focus towards her.But Khayyam’s latest piece, Bibi Rukiya’s Reckless Daughter, doesn’t quite hit home. It is in part inspired by Federico García Lorca’s The House of Bernarda Alba, the story of a grieving, domineering mother who isolates her five daughters in an oppressive household. Khayyam’s take is a story of how families, and mothers, perpetuate patriarchal systems by repeating the repressions they themselves experienced.The matriarch of the tale is potentially a fascinating character for Khayyam to explore – the tensions between tradition, honour, respect and freedom, the fear and love you have for your children. In this version, Bibi Rukiya has three daughters, one mostly falling in line – mother and daughter dance together, at a distance but in sync. The other two are more tearaway, wanting to dress up in high heels and dance a Bollywood-pop mashup to Beyoncé – at least until the spectre of their mother puts a lid on their fun.View image in fullscreenMuted in disapproval … Amina Khayyam as the mother in Bibi Rukiya’s Reckless Daughter.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianRather than domineering, Khayyam is a sometimes distant figure, muted in disapproval. The whole show is somewhat muted, in fact. There is a low-level tension, brooding like the anxious shimmer of bells on dancer Abirami Eswar’s ankles. But the real grit and detail of the subject – the question of what these women desire and in what way they are being thwarted, the texture of their emotions, the complexity of the characters and their family dynamic – is absent. It all ends in tragedy but tinged with confusion.As well as Lorca, the story is based on the experience of one of the women who took part in Khayyam’s community groups. There is powerful real-life testimony at the heart of this work, but too much goes unsaid.Atthe Place, London, until 5 NovemberExplore more on these topicsStageDanceFederico García LorcaTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Hereprises the rolefor the West End now and, after a glossy career mostly on screen in the interim, is one of the most arresting stage actors around. Harewood’s Othello holds your attention with his physical presence and imperial quality, the sniffs, smirks and tics in the lead up to his murderously wounded rage. He is so captivating to the other characters that they are frozen as he tells of meeting Desdemona at the start. He woos them, and us.Harewood is not the only Black actor on stage, which reflects Venice’s historical cultural mix, and there is not the sense of racial isolation. However, the racist language is still jarring, all the more so perhaps because Tom Morris’s production is modern-dress.View image in fullscreenShining relish … Toby Jones.Photograph: Brinkhoff-MoegenburgThe starry casting is judicious.Toby Jones, never out of fatigues as not-so-honest Iago, fights his battle for domination with a shining relish that borders on the comically conniving. He is best in company, a seemingly unassuming foot-soldier who stands in stark contrast to the man who fulminates and plots in soliloquies downstage, which seem like secrets shared with the audience.Caitlin FitzGerald, as Desdemona, is a smooth blend of strength and fearfulness, her American accent gargled with Irish, it seems. A surprising slap from her husband is one of the biggest shocks of the play, an awful turning point. Luke Treadaway (who worked with Morris on War Horse) is a paragon of goodness as Cassio, with a blond-haired air of the angelic. Vinette Robinson is marvellous as Desdemona’s maid, Emilia, and the two women’s reflections on the misogyny in their worlds reminds us of Shakespeare’s progressiveness: this is a play about gender as well as race, the wrongs wreaked on women, not only onOthello.But these are points that are mentioned, rather than built upon. This is every bit a “West End Othello” that is ravishing to look at, immaculately choreographed and darkly humorous. It is pacy and does not probe deeply or seek to connect the play’s manipulations with our era of Trumpian truths and lies (and our own trusting of the wrong people?). There is an impressive clarity of language and events as we hear how doubt against Desdemona’s virtue is first cast by her own father, Brabantio (Peter Guinness), who says “she deceived her father and may thee”, before Iago capitalises on it.Ti Green’s set laps with beauty, romantic or baleful with every switch of light and sound. PJ Harvey’s music – doomy notes and delicate tingles – adds to it. The opening scene comes with a series of grand gold frames, set against blackness all around so that it looks like characters are errant historical figures that have jumped out of their gilt-edged oil paintings, into the now. It turns modern, with diaphanous screens that gesture at doorways and corners, for whispering, spying and eavesdropping. The papal red of the senators’ gowns prefigures the blood-letting. An iridescent sky streaks across the back, turning red when Othello’s murderous jealousy is unleashed. The colours are bold, silken, glittering.It’s impressive but you are not always swept in. This is an unanchored Othello, afloat against its shifting shades of sky. That is both its weakness and strength.AtTheatre Royal Haymarket, London, until 17 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreOthelloWest EndDavid HarewoodToby JonesTom MorrisPJ HarveyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Over the past five years, developer Epic Games maintained the relevance and awareness of its ageing online shooter by churning out pop culture collaborations, from Marvel to John Wick to Sabrina Carpenter. For limited periods, players get to take part in the game as their favourite movie characters and music artists, an arrangement that provides refreshed audience numbers for the game – and a tidy revenue stream for the brands.Now it’s the turn ofThe Simpsons. This month, the Fortnite island has become a miniature Springfield, complete with popular characters and well-known locations. If you want to play as Homer and shoot up Moe’s Tavern, you can. If you want to take Bart to Kwik-E-Mart for a squishee, go ahead. Everywhere you look there’s a fun little Simpsons Easter egg, from the fact that the Battlebus (which delivers players on to the island) is now driven by Otis to the presence of Duffman, Seymour Skinner’s steamed hams and drooling aliens.But the Fortnite tie-in is only the latest example of a longstanding and symbiotic relationship between The Simpsons and video games. In 1991, less than two years after the show’s debut, Acclaim released Bart vs The Space Mutants, a side-scrolling platformer in which Bart must defeat an extraterrestrial invasion by doing frustrating pixel-perfect jumps and fighting bosses including Nelson and Sideshow Bob, while “enjoying” a scratchy sound sample of “eat my shorts” over and over again.Despite mediocre reviews, the game sold 1m copies, and inspired a rash of Bart-focused games such as Bart vs The World and Bart’s House of Weirdness. This interplay made perfect sense; Bart is, of course, a huge video game fan, and in the early days of the show, when he was the focal point of the writing, he represented the target demographic of the contemporary games industry: a mischievous 10-year-old boy with an interest in comical violence.The relationship would come to the fore in the classic 1995 Christmas episode Marge Be Not Proud in which Bart watches a TV ad for a hyper-violent hack-’em-up named Bonestorm.(The commercialhas a muscular Santa bursting into a family living room holding a rocket launcher and yelling: “Tell your folks, buy me Bonestorm or go to hell!”) It’s a clear parody of the frenzied, super-targeted marketing behind 1992’s Mortal Kombat, a game Bart would have relished thanks to its array of decapitations and eviscerations. At the end of the episode, Bart gets a video game for Christmas, but it’s the joyously sedate Lee Carvallo’s Putting Challenge. It’s funny, but it is also symbolic of the console war at the time: the rebellious Sega Mega Drive v the family-friendly Nintendo Entertainment System.View image in fullscreenEat my shorts … The Simpsons Bart vs The World for the NES.Photograph: Arcade Images/AlamyThe best early Simpsons game would arrive a few months after Bart vs Space Mutants. Konami’s 1992 arcade hit, The Simpsons, is an excellent four-player brawler in which the family is pitted against Mr Burns – who has, in a daft plot that is just an excuse to visit a lot of Springfield locations and attack enemies with skateboards and vacuum cleaners – kidnapped Maggie. My favourite example from the 1990s, though, was the 1996 PC release The Simpsons Cartoon Studio, which gave players a range of locations, characters and soundbites from the show in order to create their own mini Simpsons cartoons – a little foretaste of the TikTok memes Fortnite Simpsons fans are bound to make and share.Meanwhile, the show itself has kept finding new ways to gently satirise video games. Springfield’s regularly featured arcade Noiseland is crammed with amusing coin-operated games from Jane Fonda’s Legwarmers of Death to the wonderful My Dinner With André from season five’s Boy-Scoutz ’n the Hood (press up on the joystick to offer “Trenchant Insight”). But games are also used as a useful pop cultural tool for poking fun at the characters themselves. The favourite game of the godly Flanders kids is Billy Graham’s Bible Blaster, an evangelical preach-’em-up that has Rod Flanders shouting, “Keep firing; convert the heathens!”View image in fullscreenHey, hey kids … The Simpsons: Hit and Run.Photograph: Arcade Images/AlamyHowever, the Simpsons video game that probably best foreshadows the Fortnite tie-in is 2003’s much-loved Simpsons Hit & Run, a glorious Homer-fronted pastiche of Grand Theft Auto. Here you can drive around town visiting Android’s Dungeon, Krusty Burger and the Legitimate Businessman’s Social Club, while carrying out missions to prevent another alien plot. This was, to be honest, the last great Simpsons title, and it’s interesting how a lot ofthe games press coverageof the Fortnite tie-in is essentially: “I’d rather have Hit & Run 2, but I guess this will do.”What the collaboration really shows is how The Simpsons has continued to survive as a cultural icon, despite its decline as a must-watch TV phenomenon. The heady combination of slapstick, parody and social commentary aligns with the scrambled self-aware narratives of video games, where crazed violence often intercuts with gooey sentimentality and knockabout laughs. Both The Simpsons and video games came of age in the early 1990s, a hyperactive postmodern theme park of an era, and they have both continued to explore and exploit the worst excesses of our consumer society. Fortnite might not be the place we wanted to find a proper modern Simpsons game, but it makes sense for it to be here – a palace of memes, soundbites and cartoonish antics that will no doubt continue to generate fun and money for many years to come.What to playView image in fullscreenA work of great evil … Ball x Pit.Photograph: Kenny Sun/Devolver DigitalDespite how much I am enjoying it, I believe thatBall x Pitmay be a work of great evil. A concerningly potent combination of Space Invaders, Vampire Survivors and old ball-bouncing action games such as Breakout, it is a dungeon-delving arcade game in which you fire balls at lines of descending skeleton hordes as you descend down a bottomless pit. The balls bounce off enemies, or burn them, poison them, pass through them; every wave of defeated creatures unlocks a new suite of perks and bonuses and upgrades for you to combine. Above ground, you build a base for your characters and ping them about to harvest wood and stone to build yet more. The screen is always visually cacophonous, crowded with mesmerising waves of creatures and spells and bouncing balls. Most of the time I feel as if it’s playing itself. But still: it’s just so absorbing.Keza MacDonaldAvailable on:Nintendo Switch, PS5, Xbox, PC, MacEstimated playtime:Possibly forever, in 15-20 minute burstsWhat to readView image in fullscreen‘Blatant’ … Grand Theft Auto VI by Rockstar, which has been accused of union-busting.Photograph: Rockstar gamesThe Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, which represents a huge variety of gig economy workers including those on contracts at video game studios,has accusedGrand Theft Auto VI producerRockstar Gamesof “the most blatant and ruthless act of union-busting in the history of the games industry”.

Is it, perhaps, that coming up with interesting games that don’t involve fighting is too difficult?Not all games are violent, but all the big-budget games seem to be.”This is a much-discussed question among game designers and thinkers. Since Space Invaders, video games have presented players with an enemy to defeat: without competition and combat and adrenaline, how do you make it fun? Some see conflict as a driving force behind most stories, an almost inevitable part of game design. Others view video game violence as a failure of imagination.OnGamesindustry.bizin 2017, the game designer Brie Code posited that most games were geared towards inducing a fight-or-flight stress response in the player, and wrote about how games might move towards a different modality: tend-and-befriend. “What is game design missing? I ask this question in terms of game mechanics and game systems. I ask in terms of adrenaline, dopamine, oxytocin, opioids, and other reward systems. I ask in terms of gameplay, that helps a wider range of people understand themselves and their responses to stress and to the world.”I am also reminded of aGame Developer essayby Brian Fairbanks. “Life is complicated, messy, stressful and painful. Our problems take so many forms, and our chosen entertainment takes those problems, distills them into a single entity and puts a Foe badge on them,” he wrote. “The issue here is, in nonviolent games, we don’t have access to that power in the same way. Our games are structured so that the challenge and progression does not revolve around literally destroying your problems with weapons. We have to find other ways to get there.”By the way, there are a great many non-violent games around. Some of them, such as Animal Crossing, certainly count as blockbusters. There’s no comprehensive database off them, butThinkyGamesis the closest (you can filter out action, combat and timing), and there’s also an activenon-violent entertainmentcuration page onSteam. For family friendly, violence-free games,Common Sense Mediais a good resource.KMIf you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter –email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterFortniteThe SimpsonsAnimation on TVTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No, some will say. Probably people who have never played the original and don’t understand the appeal, but like to tilt their head with a mixture of bemusement and condescension and say: “So what do youdoin the game? Just wash things?”(It feels unfair that other pastimes don’t have to justify themselves like this. No one ever says, “Wait, you just run around the park in a circle for five kilometres?” Or, “So you just kick the ball with your foot?”)Yes, is the short answer. You point your hose at whatever mucky thing is in front of you – a bungalow, a monster truck, Lara Croft’s mansion – and blast all that filth into oblivion. Each time you finish a section, a pleasing ”ding” rings out, triggering your brain to release a little bit more dopamine. This is the only sound in the game, save for the rush of water and the occasional clang of a metal ladder. The whole experience is intensely soothing, deeply satisfying, and mesmerising. I love it.I love it so much that in 2023 I played PowerWash Simulator for 24 hours, 6 minutes and 33 seconds, live on streaming service Twitch –setting the Guinness World Recordfor the longest time spent playing the game.View image in fullscreenWash this … PowerWash Simulator 2.Photograph: FuturLabI would not recommend it. As enjoyable as the game is, the shine does start to wear off after about… 20 hours. I remember things started to get weird around 4am. The bright primary colours of the children’s playground I was cleaning began swirling together in a psychedelic frenzy. My vision was blurring, my fingers were aching, and I was overcome by a burning rage at the local council for allowing the climbing frame to get into this state.I pushed through with the support of myTwitchcommunity, who encouraged me to keep going and reminded me that a reality outside the game did exist. But I had flashbacks for months afterwards. Sometimes, lying in bed at night, I was convinced I could still hear the endless hiss of the jet spray, and would worry I’d given myself tinnitus. To this day I find it difficult to walk past a slide without checking the underside for mildew.Funnily enough, I didn’t feel like playing PowerWash Simulator for a while after the record-setting session. But it has been a joy to pick up the sequel and rediscover the sense of achievement that only comes from obliterating the final speck of encrusted faecal matter from a chrome toilet bowl. Bliss.It helps that this instalment feels a touch more forgiving when it comes to cleaning every last atom of dirt. There is also a new target icon directing you to bits you’ve missed, which makes finishing missions less frustrating.And of course there are new things to wash. PowerWash Simulator 2 features 38 missions in total, including an airship, a mobility scooter and a shopping mall. New gadgets include a surface cleaner for more efficient floor polishing, and a harness system so you can abseil down buildings. There’s a wider selection of soaps and nozzles, plus a new home base where you can display evidence of your achievements. This is particularly appealing if you’re the kind of person who has hung their (three) Guinness World Record certificates in the hallway so they’re the first thing the DPD driver sees when you open your front door.None of this adds up to a radical departure from the original game. Nor is the sequel likely to win over people who couldn’t see the point the first time around. But PowerWash Simulator 2gives the fans what they want: new things to wash, extra toys to play with, further unchallenging yet satisfying gameplay. Plus the option to occasionally draw a crude representation of male genitalia in the dirt for lols. With all the madness going on out there, this is exactly the game the world needs right now.PowerWash Simulator 2 is available now; £19.99/$24.99Explore more on these topicsGamesPCNintendo Switch 2TwitchSimulation gamescommentShareReuse this content"

As he unveils the building and its ‘unapologetically diverse’ contents, can he pull it off?Jason OkundayeTue 4 Nov 2025 19.01 ESTShareWhen Gus Casely-Hayford was a child, his sister Margaret took him to the British Museum. He hadn’t always enjoyed museums: “As much as I was attracted to them, they weren’t places I felt wholly welcome in,” he says – especially since they rarely told the stories of Black British people like him. But Margaret was determined. “She told me that these spaces belong to all of us. They may not tell our stories, but she would say to me ‘That’s something that you can change.’”Now, as the director of V&A East, he’s building a space in which “young people can come in and have those transformative moments that change the trajectory of their lives”. These are grand ambitions for the project which lives on two sites in London’s Olympic Park:V&A Storehouse, which opened in May this year and has already exceeded its visitor target in a third of the projected time, and V&A East Museum, an exhibition and gallery space housed within a five-storey building designed by Irish architects O’Donnell & Tuomey on Stratford Waterfront. The aim, says V&A director Tristram Hunt, is “to open the V&A’s collection up in new ways to audiences which have historically been underserved by major cultural institutions”.After years of delay, which Casely-Hayford attributes to “the pandemic … issues with labour supply” and the enormous challenge of launching “two buildings of this level of complexity”, the museum site will finally open its doors to the public on18 April next year. It’s a key part ofEast Bank, the mayor of London’s £1.1bn cultural and education quarter designed to transform the former Olympic boroughs, what Hunt calls “a crucial component of the London 2012 legacy”. V&A East sits alongside Sadler’s Wells East, London College of Fashion, UCL East and BBC Music Studios. What slice of the pie did the V&A get from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport? A “very generous” one, Casely-Hayford replies.View image in fullscreen‘Objects that tell the story of human creativity’ … a rendering of the V&A East Museum’s Why We Make galleries.Photograph: JA_Projects for the Victoria and Albert Museum, LondonThe director is charming and cheerful, but it’s his passion for the arts which leaves the greatest impression when I meet him at the V&A Storehouse, surrounded by a collage of references from football shirts to bikes and vases left by local school students. His mission for V&A East was to make it a welcoming and inspiring place for any young, creatively minded person who might not yet be ready to absorb the South Kensington V&A, the institution’s mothership, but who has grown out of Young V&A, aimed at children under 14. Casely-Hayford says that east London was the perfect home: as well as the capital’s traditional manufacturing and designing base, “it has given us some of the truly great creative figures – Alexander McQueen, David Bailey”. Casely-Hayford says that he is determined to find “equivalent figures” within younger generations and have V&A East as their point of access to the arts. “You see lots of young people who are full of that creative passion, but they don’t necessarily feel at home in museums.”To address this, over the course of the past five years, he has personally visited every single secondary school in the four boroughs surrounding the site, while the broader project has consulted about 30,000 young people, influencing every aspect of the institution, from the permanent collection to the staff uniform (a burgundy waistcoat with a cinched back that can be customised to allow for self-expression). The staffing of the project also reflects the demographic complexity of the area. “We’ve worked really hard to embed V&A East in local communities,” Casely-Hayford says. “This is a space that belongs to them. These are collections which belong to all of us. Hearing them reflect back the passion, the aspirations, the objectives, in terms that are theirs is deeply heartening.”So what will be on show? Hunt says that “we have radically reinterpreted the V&A’s world-class collections through a contemporary lens, allowing us to explore topics that matter to our audiences, such as representation, identity, wellbeing, craft practice and social justice.” V&A East Museum’s permanent collection is called Why We Make. “Before we walk or talk,” Casely-Hayford says, “we make. It’s an impulse that is shared by every culture and across the span of human history.”The idea that we shouldn’t be trying to make our audience broad and diverse is absurdThe collection is composed of about 500 objects from more than 200 practitioners across more than 60 nations. One is a piece by Bisila Noah, an Ecuadorian Guinea Spanish ceramicist, which Casely-Hayford describes as “absolutely exquisite”. There will also be a pink dress by local designerMolly Goddard, and textiles from the postwar Trinidadian designerAlthea McNish, “objects that tell the story of human creativity through all the different mediums that the V&A is known for.” V&A East will, Casely-Hayford says, be unapologetically diverse. “Those different components of intellectual DNA inform all national museums. The idea that we shouldn’t be engaging in trying to make our audiences as broad, as diverse, as universal as possible, seems to be counter to that.”There will also be temporary exhibitions, the first calledThe Music Is Black, an odyssey through 125 years of Black British music history, exploring genres from calypso and hip-hop to reggae and drill. Casely-Hayford won’t go into details about what the exhibition contains, but Seal, Shirley Bassey, Stormzy and Little Simz will all feature in some way, along with the first guitar owned by Joan Armatrading, a “personal hero” of the director.As optimistic as this all sounds, how will Casely-Hayford handle the bigger issues facing museums? He has been a leading voice in the return of looted artefacts, an issue the V&A isconfronting. “I’m very proud that the V&A is among a number of museums who have returned objects, particularly the programme we’ve been involved in withGhana,” he says. “We’re limited by statute in the ways we can engage with these collections, so they are returned on loan, and are on display in the Manhyia Palace Museum at this very moment.”View image in fullscreenPioneer … Shirley Bassey in the first temporary exhibition The Music Is Black.Photograph: © Harry Hammond, Courtesy of Victoria and Albert Museum, LondonOn the issue of ethical funding (since, like many museums, V&A East will use corporate sponsorship to help pay for some temporary exhibitions) he’s less specific. Some museum representatives have dismissed objections to museums taking money from companies which pollute the environment or worse as“relentless negativity”. “Ethical funding is something that concerns everyone who works in museums,” Casely-Hayford says. “And of course, we would want to be deeply scrupulous about any institution, company or partner that we engage with.”He’s a scion of the Casely-Hayford dynasty, a prominent Ghanaian-British family descended from JE Casely-Hayford, a 19th-century politician and writer who was an advocate of pan-African nationalism. His Ghanaian father, Victor, was a trained lawyer who worked as an accountant, and his Sierra Leonean mother, Ransolina, worked for the British Council. Both were immigrants to Britain.His elder siblings were all high achievers – his sister Margaret was chancellor of Coventry University, and brother Peter an executive producer of BBC’s Panorama. Another brother Joe, who died of cancer in 2019 aged 62, was a pioneering fashion designer, and the focal point of Somerset House’s 2023 exhibition on Black fashion,The Missing Thread. Casely-Hayford becomes emotional when talking about him. “I absolutely adored him, he was my inspiration,” he says. “The other day I was looking at my bookshelves. I have a range of very old art books and when I opened them up, every single one was a present from him.”View image in fullscreenLocal talent … work by designer Molly Goddard, will feature.Photograph: Ben Broomfield/Image courtesy of Molly GoddardCasely-Hayford has had a long and varied career, presenting the BBC seriesLost Kingdoms of Africa, authoring books on West African art and, before joining V&A East, working as director of theSmithsonian’s National Museum of African Artin Washington DC (he says that it “breaks my heart” to see the Trumpian persecution of his former colleagues’ work). His first start in the museum sector came after he completed his PhD in African history from SOAS University of London and joined the learning department of the British Museum, the same space in which Margaret told him of the possibility of change.While there he stagedAfrica 05, the largest African arts season ever hosted in Britain, which engaged 150 cultural institutions to “contribute towards a particular moment in 2005 when we celebrated Africa and its history”. This extravaganza also served as a disruption to the sector. “Museums, by their very nature, are conservative,” Casely-Hayford says. “They don’t just hold the past. But many people within museums reify aspects of it.” What did he learn from pulling off this feat? “That you can make the changes that seem to be impossible.”He describes V&A East as the greatest project of his career, in fulfilling his aim to make these institutions which were founded “for all of us” universally accessible. “These are spaces that tell our stories through the best things that humanity has ever created,” he says. “The arts are about us making a mark that we hope will outlast us. And one of the few ways in which we can really know what other people are feeling, rather than thinking alone, is through creativity.Museumsare repositories of the finest of those impulses.”V&A East Museum opens on 18 April 2026Explore more on these topicsArt and designV&AMuseumsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As if to ram home the point, they decorated an entire chapel with bones dug up from the town’s overflowing cemeteries. The sign outside theChapel of Bonesroughly translates as “We bones in here wait for yours to join us”. Cheerful lot, those monks. Columns, walls, arches – all are covered in skulls, tibias, fibulas, clavicles. Rapt, I can’t stop staring, then start to chuckle when I see skulls curving round frilly frescoes of cherubim on vaulted ceilings, a whimsical touch of chintz among the ghoulishness.Evora locator map for PortugalÉvora has me in its grip even before I come to the Chapel of Bones. This former royal city of Portuguese kings and capital of the Alentejo region has so many architectural and cultural treasures wedged within its historical centre that it’s often referred to as a living museum. But in a museum, you generally have to keep your voice down: here in Évora, there’s the buzz you get with 11,000 university students roaming round a Unesco world heritage site old town that’s encased within medieval walls.I feel a pang of envy when I visit the 16th-centuryCollege of the Holy Spiritwithin the University of Évora, which is open to the public willing to pay €3 and take pot luck as to which of the ridiculously beautiful classrooms are free at that moment. My guide, Andre Birken, came to Évora from Germany as an Erasmus student years ago and decided to stay. Chilly northern Germany or laid-back southern Portugal, where even in late October it’s still 23C? Bit of a no-brainer, he tells me. He shows me classrooms decorated in the azulejo tiles for which Portugal is renowned, and where, if the lecture gets dull, you can lose yourself in bucolic blue-and-white scenes.The ancient Romans, rather than the Greeks, left their mark on Évora in a more monumental style, including an enormousaqueductthat’s one of the first things visitors see as they approach the city. Rising in the centre of the old town are the 14 graceful Corinthian columns of theRoman temple built for emperor Augustusaround the 1st century AD (and not, as is commonly assumed, dedicated to the goddess Diana). Surrounding it are buildings that typify most of the architecture here – low-slung, whitewashed, trimmed in ochre and usually sporting wrought-iron balconies. One of them is my hotel, a 15th-century former convent turned into the Pousada del Convento Évora. Every cobbled lane in the old town has this same style of architecture, and I find its uniformity immensely pleasing and harmonious – the white reflecting the sun, the mustardy ochre reminding me of the landscapes of the Alentejo around me, whose brownness is dotted with olive groves and cork forests.View image in fullscreenThe Chapel of Bones.Photograph: Sirbouman/AlamyAnd vineyards, of course, all of them blazing with autumnal colours. Alentejo is one of Portugal’s major wine regions, and its subregion of Baixo Alentejo will be2026’s European Wine City. About 10 minutes’ drive from Évora isFitapreta Winery, the brainchild of the innovative Portuguese winemaker António Maçanita and the British viticulturist David Booth. In 2015, Maçanita bought an old fortified manor house that had been in the same family since the 14th century, resurrecting ancient grape varieties, planting new vineyards and sticking to organic production. It’s an idyllic spot for a leisurely wine-tasting, followed by an even more leisurely lunch.Within the modern winery (its facade clad in cork in a nod to Portugal’s millions of cork forests), André Alves leads me through a tasting of five of the winery’s 22 varieties – all indigenous. A deliciously bone-dry rosé (amusingly named Freshly Squeezed), a fresh-tasting orange-type wine that technically wasn’t an orange wine (A Laranja Mecânica) and the very elegant red Enxarrama all made me wish I had room to stash these in my luggage.View image in fullscreenHeavenly … Azulejo tiles in the University of Évora.Photograph: Geogphotos/AlamyThis is only the preamble. Sommelier Francisco Cunha of the winery’sA Cozinha do Paço restaurantthen guides me into the part of the manor house that was originally the chapel, and whose galleried upper floor is one of the many atmospheric spots where they serve a seven-course lunch that deserves some serious Michelin attention. Braised fennel and a gorgeous sheep’s milk cheese sauce with turbot, and the famed black pig of the Alentejo paired with a cauliflower cream quenelle were exquisite.In fact, excellent food is a given in Alentejo. AtEnoteca Cartuxanear the Roman temple, they serve their own wines to go with plates of thin buttery slices of cured black pig and chorizo; not to mention the sublime Monte da Vinha sheep’s milk cheese that’s as gooey and as good as an Époisses. The venerableRestaurante Fialhocomes out with classic Alentejo dishes done expertly: pigs’ cheeks braised in red wine melt in the mouth, and pork and clams unite in a piquant red peppery stew.Évora’s food and wine alone make it a worthy holder of the2027 European Capital of Culturetitle, even without its architectural marvels. Then again, Évora Cathedral is magnificent, with a typical mishmash of architectural styles, from romanesque and gothic to Renaissance and baroque. From here, it’s almost a rite of passage to walk down the narrow pedestrianised Rua Cinco de Outubro and its souvenir and craft shops wedged into white and yellow houses. Yes, it’s touristy, but delightful nonetheless, with cork handbags and ceramics actually made in Portugal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is the spot for lazy and mild autumn mornings with a coffee and apastel de natacustard tart or a cheesy tart calledqueijada de Évora, before heading off in search of more of the town’s oddities.Explore Portugal’s historic hilltop hamlets in a free electric hire carRead moreOne in particular catches my eye: the row of very cute houses built under the 16th-century aqueduct Água de Prata, in the north-western part of the old town. I need more time here, yet I end up following the tourist trail out of Évora for a morning in the hilltop village of Monsaraz, right by the Spanish border. Here, in this all-white village, where craft boutiques and wine shops attract the tourists, it feels less real, more toytown. It’s all very pretty, and I even get a closer look at the beaches of Alqueva, western Europe’s largest artificial lake, just outside the village.But I was missing Évora, which manages to hold on to its mellowness despite the growing number of tourists. I recall a chat with my guide, Andre, who mentioned the number of people who take day trips from Lisbon (only 90-odd minutes away) and tour groups who stop for a night or two. But they need four, five days, maybe a week, he says, to get the most out of it. I’m inclined to agree, as these too-short days fly by and I don’t get round to following the nature trails out of the town, or visiting all of the museums, or having another lazy coffee and eating apastel de natain the sunshine. Those monks were right: life really is too short.The trip was provided byKirker Holidays, which has three-night breaks atPousada Convento Évorain November from £819pp, including breakfast, car hire and flights, although rail options are also available.

Turn what might otherwise be wasted into this luxurious toffee sauce to savour on Bonfire Night, especially when drizzled generously over cinnamon baked apples with scoops of vanilla ice-cream.Toffee sauce with baked applesApples transform beautifully when baked, turning this hyper-seasonal fruit into a super-simple yet decadent dessert. I prefer cox or braeburn varieties (ie, something not too large), so you can serve one apple per person.Gordon Ramsay’s recipes are my go-to for traditional techniques that deliver reliable results. Here, I’ve adapted his recipe for caramel sauce to make use of every last drop from a golden syrup tin, reduced the amount of sugar, and added sea salt and optional vanilla to heighten the quintessential taste of British toffee. (The invert sugars in golden syrup are the secret to achieving a silky-smooth toffee sauce, because sugar alone can recrystallise, leaving it grainy.) If you don’t have golden syrup, glucose syrup or honey also work well.This versatile sauce works with all manner of desserts, from a classic banana split to these baked apples with ice-cream. The warm sauce melts seductively over the hot fruit, creating a wonderful juxtaposition of flavours, textures and temperatures. Keep any excess sauce in a sealed container in the fridge for up to two weeks, or for a few months in the freezer.Serves6-8For the toffee sauce2-3 tbspgolden syrup(I used the dregs of a tin), or glucose syrup or honey180g sugar(white or brown)½ tsp sea salt150ml double cream50g unsalted butter1 tsp vanilla extract(optional)For the apples6 medium dessert apples60g sultanas or raisins30g sugar30g butter½ tsp ground cinnamonCream or ice-cream, to serveTo get every last drop from a tin of golden syrup, pour in about 100ml boiling water and, holding the tin in a cloth to protect your hand, swirl it around and scrape the sides with a spoon until clean. Tip this sweet liquid into a large pan. (If you’re not finishing off a tin, simply measure two or three spoonfuls of syrup into a pan and add 100ml hot water instead.) Sprinkle in the sugar and salt, set the pan on a medium heat and swirl (rather than stir) the pan occasionally, until the sugar and salt dissolve.Leave the syrup to bubble gently without touching it, then, once you see the sugar at the base of the pan start to colour, swirl again so the mix caramelises evenly. Once it’s golden brown, take the pan off the heat and carefully pour in the double cream (the caramel will bubble up, so stand back), then stir to make a smooth sauce. Add the butter and vanilla, if using, and stir again until glossy. Serve hot or transfer to a bowl and leave to cool.Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5, and core the apples. In a bowl, mash the sultanas, sugar, butter and cinnamon, then press this mixture into the hollow of each apple. Sit each apple in a hole of a muffin tray, to catch all the juices, then bake for 25–30 minutes, until tender when pierced with the tip of a knife. Serve warm topped with some toffee sauce and perhaps a spoonful of cream or ice-cream.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteDessertBakingFruitSauces and graviesBonfire NightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is a quiet ode to them. Then, there’s a deep, buttery richness to pistachios that comes out best when they’re finely ground with flour – the oils release, the texture softens and the flavour becomes more pronounced; the addition of just a little matcha brings a quiet bitterness and depth, enough to hold its own without overpowering. It’s a loaf that feels composed – not flashy, but quietly fragrant with just the right amount of earthiness.Pistachio and matcha loaf cake (pictured top)This cake is close-crumbed and tender, and finished with a thin glaze of matcha icing that sets to a soft, pale-green sheen.Prep5 minCook1 hr 10 min, plus coolingMakes1450gloaf150g plainflour4g baking powder100g shelled pistachios3g matcha powder2g fine sea salt150g golden castersugar150g plant-based milk20g olive oilFor the matcha icing30g cocoa butter(deodorised)20g groundnutoil100g icingsugar2g matcha powder,plus extra for sprinklingHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and put a shelf in the middle of the oven. Line a 450g loaf tin with baking paper, so it overhangs slightly to help with easy removal of the cake later.Put the flour, baking powder, pistachios, matcha and salt in a food processor and pulse until the pistachios are finely ground and the mixture begins to clump together slightly. This clumping indicates that the oils from the pistachios have been released and are evenly distributed through the dry ingredients.Pour the sugar, milk and oil into the food processor and pulse again to combine, scraping down the sides to make sure everything gets nicely incorporated. You can also transfer the dry ingredients to a bowl and whisk in the sugar, milk and oil with a balloon whisk until the batter is smooth and lump-free. Take care not to overmix, but do make sure that all the dry ingredients are fully incorporated and there are no streaks.Pour the batter into the prepared tin and spread it out evenly with a spatula so it has a smooth top. Bake for 45–50 minutes, or until the top is golden and a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Don’t open the oven until at least 35 minutes have passed, otherwise the cake might collapse. The cake should rise slightly and feel springy to the touch.Remove, leave to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then use the paper overhang to lift it out. Gently peel off the paper, then put on a rack to cool completely.Meanwhile, make the icing. Melt the cocoa butter in a saucepan on a low heat, then add the oil, icing sugar and matcha and whisk to make a smooth, glossy glaze.Pour the glaze over the top of the cooled cake on its rack – if need be, use a dry pastry brush to spread it over the cake – then leave at room temperature to set.The cake can now be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to three days. For longer storage, wrap it tightly in clingfilm and freeze for up to three months. Defrost at room temperature.Light fruit cakeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Matt Russell/Quadrille.

Line a 450g loaf tin with baking paper, ensuring it extends slightly over the edges – this will help with easy removal of the cake once baked.Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a large bowl. In a second bowl or jug, whisk the milk, oil, sugar, orange zest and vanilla, mixing until the sugar starts to dissolve. Add the wet ingredients to the dry, then fold in gently until just combined and there are no streaks.Drain any excess rum from the raisins, then fold them into the batter along with the candied orange pieces and cranberries, so the fruit is evenly distributed throughout the batter.Pour the batter into the prepared tin, then spread it out evenly with a spatula.

The idea of combining a Korean preservation method with a French technique is exactly what I love about creativity in the kitchen. This mirepoix kimchi is not just a fun ferment to dot on savoury oatmeal or eat alongside cheese, but it also acts as the backbone for a plant-based, umami-filled chilli.Mirepoix kimchi (pictured top)This versatile, umami-rich paste is a twist on the classic mirepoix and can be used to add a hit of flavour to everything from soups to marinades, or even enjoyed as is.Prep10 minFerment2weeks+Makes500ml jar150g carrot150g white onion150g celery13½g salt(or 3% of the total weight of the first three ingredients)½tbsp red miso,or fish sauce½tbsp sugar15g gochugaru chilli flakesRoughly chop the vegetables (there is no need to peel the carrots if they have been rinsed), then put them in a food processor. Add the remaining ingredients and blitz to a rough paste.Decant the paste into a sterilised 500ml jar and pack it down to ensure there are no air pockets; there may not be much brine, so to minimise oxygen exposure, lay a piece of greaseproof paper on top of the mirepoix to act as a barrier.Seal the jar and leave to ferment at room temperature and out of direct sunlight for at least two weeks. At the two-week mark, start tasting the kimchi and, once you’re happy with the flavour and tang, store the jar in the fridge.Vegetarian umami chilliView image in fullscreenKenji Morimoto’s vegetarian umami chilli.This plant-based chilli is a powerhouse of flavour, thanks to the mirepoix kimchi and miso offering layers of heat and umami.
