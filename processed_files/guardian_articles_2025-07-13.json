As he stood on Centre Court match point up againstCarlos Alcaraz, perhaps some of the old skills kicked in. Skiing teaches balance, it teaches flexibility and endurance, but most of all it teaches faith. There is a moment in every slide, before friction kicks in, when the body is basically at the mercy of powder and physics. And the greatest skiers learn that this is the moment to hold your nerve. When it feels like you’re falling, keep falling. When it feels like the edge of disaster, keep going.Three match points against Alcaraz; take two. You’ve lost your last five matches against this guy. He’s the double defending champion. The last time you played, a few short weeks ago, he came back from two sets and three match points down to win. It was one of the most dramatic comebacks ever seen in a grand slam final, and here we are again. Alcaraz saves the first match point. He saves the second. The noise level is rising to a climax. When it feels like you’re falling, keep falling.Jannik Sinner roars back to beat Carlos Alcaraz for first Wimbledon final winRead moreSinner’s coach, Darren Cahill, tells a lovely story about that defeat at Roland Garros. Afterwards, as he’s leaving the players’ lounge to get in his car, Sinner stops at a big glass jar of gummy sweets placed by the exit. Most players walk straight past it out of deference to their nutritionist. Some take one or two as a treat or souvenir. Sinner takes the whole jar. Carries it out under his arm. Hands them out gleefully to his team afterwards. That was the moment Cahill knew he was going to be OK.And so perhaps we all took the wrong lesson from that epic tussle last month. The very fact that Alcaraz had required a comeback that colossal simply to claim a narrow victory, via a fifth set tie-break, should have been a sign that the hard tangibles still favoured Sinner, if he could just keep his nerve, keep giving himself a chance, keep falling. Most neutral observers backed Alcaraz ahead ofthis final, albeit with two caveats. One, it was going to be close. Two, Alcaraz would need to pull out every last miracle in his pocket.Because even Sinner’s bogstandard, pasta-and-cheese tennis is of such a relentlessly high level that it basically requires a godlike genius like Alcaraz to unravel it. The only players to beat him in the last year are Alcaraz, Alexander Bublik, Andrey Rublev, Daniil Medvedev, and what they all have in common is a certain unpredictability, verging on the mercurial. Take Sinner out of his comfort zone, and you have a puncher’s chance. Because what constitutes Sinner’s comfort zone is perhaps the most uncomfortable place it is possible to exist in professional tennis.View image in fullscreenJannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz embrace after the trophy presentation.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThere’s not much mystery there. Sinner is going to hit it clean, and he’s going to hit it quick, and he’s going to hit it hard, and he’s going to do it all afternoon. Sinner takes you into a tunnel of pain, to the point where you start to despair of ever seeing the end, perhaps that there even is an end. Alcaraz’s serve collapsed in sets three and four because of the sheer pressure Sinner was putting on it, forcing him to go for a little more every time. The endless drop shots were a desperate attempt to end the points quickly, because staying in them was simply too agonising.And of course Alcaraz has a higher pain threshold than most. He even took the first set in characteristically theatrical style, thrusting a backhand winner into the open court while tumbling to the ground like a cheetah slipping over in the ketchup aisle. This is the best of Alcaraz: tennis on the very edge of the world, tennis that moves people, tennis as dialogue. Part of the reason I think he likes grass so much is that it gives him something back. He treads and it responds, and in a slightly different way every time.Was what followed the worst of Alcaraz? Perhaps instead we should give Sinner his due. From high in the stands, the prevailing motif of the last couple of sets was the constant puffs of chalk dust on Alcaraz’s side of the net, as Sinner’s strokes kept pinging the lines like sniper’s bullets.Tennisas warfare, tennis as intimidation, tennis as the end of an argument.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No miracles, no rocks or bumps, just a smooth slide to the bottom of the mountain. The crowd were hot and drunk and satisfied. Someone popped a champagne cork just as Sinner was about to serve. Someone shouted: “Come on, Tim,” during the fourth set, and frankly what’s Yvette Cooper going to do about this particular menace to our nation? Finally Sinner served, and for the last time the ball did not come back.Another twist, then, in this brilliant little rivalry. And this was a good result for the rivalry, good for the lore, good for the narrative as the tour swings towards the hard courts of North America and Alcaraz’s bid for New York redemption. Perhaps even good for Alcaraz too in the long run, a champion who could learn a little of Sinner’s ruthlessness on the off-beats, who often struggles to find his voice when the dialogue falls silent.As for Sinner, once the celebrations had died away, he did a strange thing. He patted the grass with the palm of his hand, again and again, almost as if thanking it, as if it were a faithful horse. The four-time grand slam champion climbed the steps to his box, clasped his family in his arms and cried like a little boy again, a little boy who had reached for the sweets and come away with the whole damn jar.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Jannik SinnerCarlos AlcarazWimbledonTennisanalysisShareReuse this content"

The bestselling author explains why now is the perfect time for romanceIrvine WelshSun 13 Jul 2025 07.00 EDTShareIwas born in the great port of Leith. Stories are in my blood; listening to them, telling them. My family were typical of many in the area, moving from tenement to council scheme, increasingly further down the Forth estuary. I was brought up in a close community. I left school with practically no qualifications. I tended towards the interesting kids, the troublemakers. All my own fault. I was always encouraged to be more scholarly by my parents, who valued education. But I left school and became an apprentice technician, doing a City & Guilds course. I hated it. I was always a writer: I just didn’t know it. I cite being crap at everything else in evidence.It’s why I’ve never stopped writing stories about my youth and my go-to gang of characters fromTrainspotting. Their reaction to events and changes in the world helps inform my own. They’ve been given substance by people I’ve met down the decades, from Leith pubs to Ibiza clubs.But I have never seen myself as an author. If I wrote purely for publication, and let it become a franchise, it would just be another job, albeit an enjoyable one, and better than digging coal. But I never wanted it to be that. As far as I’m concerned, I’m awriter. I de facto retired from the world of work over 30 years ago, packing in my day job at the council to pursue my hobbies of writing and music. If I had the inclination for franchise building, I would have released my books sequentially, in a temporal order, following the characters’ lives. If I wanted to chase literary prizes, I’d have written the kind of novels expected to appeal to the people who judge such affairs.Basically, I wait until something inspiring emerges – theme, event, character or storyline – to act as a catalyst and pique my interest infinallywriting up my notes, sketches and stories to publishable standard. Skagboys was the first thing I wrote, appearing on my Amstrad word processor as the opening sections ofTrainspotting. The resulting book was way too long, so I threw away that first part, opting to take the reader right into the drug-addled world of Renton, Sick Boy, Spud and co, all the way back in 1993.When I got older and more reflective, I thought I’d revisit how the protagonists got into the state they did before Trainspotting: I’d write about the Thatcherite destruction of the traditional working class. SoSkagboys(2012) revisited old territory. But in the meantime, I had leapt ahead almost a decade into those characters’ lives withPorno(2002). I saw that book as being about the increasing commodification of sex, as we moved into the internet age. Way further down the line,Dead Men’s Trousers(2018) was inspired by my experiments with the drug DMT, and the even more astonishing phenomenon of Hibs winning the Scottish Cup.And now I’m back with those characters again.Men in Love, taking place directly after Trainspotting, opens on a junk-sick Renton sweating in an Amsterdam hotel room with his bag of cash, with Sick Boy ferreting around London on the perma-hustle, Spud and Second Prize back in Leith, trying to avoid heroin and alcohol – the drugs that chose them – and Begbie a guest of HMP Saughton. As the title suggests, Men in Love is mainly about that time in life when men (generally in their mid-20s) start taking the quest for romance more seriously.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The ‘village’ of old replaced by the shouty swamp of online lifeNovels, no matter how well researched, composed or projected, are always – whether you like it or not – at least tangentially about you. Writing Men in Love made me realise that, when I stop running away from it, I’ve usually enjoyed love unquestioningly, without feeling the need to analyse or even understand it. The checklists of dating apps, articles, self-help books, the inventories of salient points of attraction, ideal types and red flags always seemed to me a boring, algorithmic and reductive response to a very human, mystical phenomenon. Much of what I’ve learned about love has been experiential, not observational, about not being gun-shy and diving in when the opportunity presented itself. And yes, some romantic sensibilities have been augmented by the imagination and insight of various novelists, from Jane Austen to James Kelman.Looking back now, it strikes me that your mid-20s is a strange time to be embarking on serious romance. Linked to traditional modes of commerce, procreation and survival, we remain culturally bound by such influences, driven to “settle down”. Once ossified in our social structure, such imperatives are now fading, and perhaps it’s about time.For men in their mid-20s, the influence of your partner suddenly becomes greater than that of your peers. It also seems that, in an atomised, narcissistic society, we are left less equipped than ever to meet our bonding needs. The nurturing “village” of old is replaced by the shouty swamp of the online experience, where people are compelled to create ludicrous personas that they can’t live up to in reality. No wonder so many people can no longer be bothered with the whole business. I’m often astounded thatanyrelationships take place at all.View image in fullscreenBad boys … Ewan McGregor and Johnny Lee Miller in Trainspotting.Photograph: Cinetext Collection/Sportsphoto/AllstarMen in Love is my attempt to look at where men go wrong (and maybe sometimes right) in our efforts to subjugate our own pulsating needs to do daft, fabulous things like watch sport, get drunk and obsess about obscure musical offerings, for the greater good of romance, commerce, status, procreation, sex, and yes, L-O-V-E; whatever the motives for joining together with someone are.I think it is as much – probably more – a book for women, who acutely understand the nutters they went out with in their “bad boy phase”, as it is for such men (and I still count myself as only a semi-reformed version of that breed) to understand themselves. It’s a crazy, romantic, joyous journey through our higher aspirations, and the inherently ridiculous mortal stupidity and selfishness that constantly undermines them.Things have changed since I wrote Trainspotting. The working class (like the middle class and the government) no longer have any money, trades or careers; just a patchwork quilt of precarious, low-paid jobs waiting to be destroyed by AI. Some deal drugs. This is usually not really for profit, but youths – like the preening oligarchs who dominate the world – need compelling drama. They engage in meaningless turf wars, constantly in search of their own dopamine hits to distract from the uselessness society has pushed them into; an existence of eating rubbish and watching crap on screens, bloating into obesity as their mental health crumbles. The working class are no longer represented by any political party. They have no voice: nobody will write about them, make films about them, far less advocate for them. They are expected to die quietly.Why publish Men in Love at this time? I think we need love more than ever. Loads of it. Orwell wrote: “If there is hope, it lies with the proles.” I think now, if there is hope, it lies with the lovers.Men in Love by Irvine Welsh is published by Jonathan Cape on 24 July.

Plus watermelon and feta salad, and whipped Marmite butter and sourdough.View image in fullscreenThe big beefJoI’m very much in favour of sex before marriage. The foundations of a solid marriage are having total communication, honesty and transparency – being aligned in lots of areas, knowing that you’re going to grow together.Sexis a big part of your identity, not huge, but to hold that back would be not to reveal all your colours. And, while I think people do change as couples, if your libidos are misaligned, or you have very different niche interests, these are things partners should know.People may have waited in the past and still made the marriage work, but often people just stayed together even though they were very unhappy.RubyI totally take the point that testing out your sexual chemistry is important. I want to be careful not to misrepresent myself as a puritan in this regard. But the flip side is, if you’re having sexual partners without any meaningful connection, that’s not sexual exploration either, really. More meaningful sex should be sought after; that doesn’t necessarily come from waiting until marriage, but we don’t live in a culture that promotes sexual learning.JoShe felt that people had become hypersexualised, very focused on sex and not considering anything else. I don’t think sex is such a big deal that it needs to be shut off, and I don’t think the solution to a hypersexualised culture is to go completely the other way.RubyLots of young people suffer from a lack of freedom in the role they’re expected to perform. There’s a huge range of diverse attitudes to sex and equality, but the hypersexualised, Sabrina Carpenter brand of feminism is quite dominant, which is a homogenising experience for people who don’t buy into it. I think it’s quite a plastic form of sexual liberation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It’s a gendered stereotype to suggest that girls can’t enjoy sex without connection or can’t enjoy sex without intimacy. And, on sex work, we didn’t completely disagree – we both think it should be decriminalised and agreed that, for the majority of sex workers, it’s not the first thing they’d choose if they had other options. But we have to be very careful of saying to women: “You think you’re autonomous, but you’re not.”RubyI find it hard to see how sex work is liberating. Just as pornography is through a male lens, buyers of sex are predominantly men. It relies on a world where women’s sexual presentation is distorted to meet a male gaze. It fetishises white, thin women, and we know men’s sexual preferences aren’t described by that. I think women have a responsibility not to meet these expectations.View image in fullscreenFor aftersRubyWomen do have agency to resist the expectations that are put on to us.

Perhaps a bleak mood just settled on us all as we watched those grim Covid press conferences (“Next slide, please”) and hasn’t quite lifted?Yet the economics of wellbeing, pioneered by academics including Richard Layard at the LSE and the former monetary policy committee member Danny Blanchflower, allows us to pinpoint some of the causes of this malaise, instead of dismissing it as some kind of national vibe shift.As the PBE analysis makes clear, these causes include the persistence of poor physical health, poor mental health, and loneliness.Government policy is already firmly pointed at tackling the shortcomings in theNHSthat seem to have contributed to the public’s ongoing health struggles. The state of the health service came up consistently in last year’s general election campaign, and the Treasury is concerned about the impact of continued high rates of economic inactivity on the labour market.Mental health is relatively high on Labour’s agenda, too, with promises to install more mental health professionals in schools, for example. Tackling loneliness is a more complex proposition in policy terms, with no single lever to pull.Plans in Rachel Reeves’s spending review to invest in neighbourhood-level projects to improve “community cohesion, regeneration and improving the public realm” may help here, albeit on a relatively small scale.Recentwork by the Independent Commission on Neighbourhoodshas underlined the importance of institutions such as parks, community centres and libraries, for fostering important human connections.If the Department for Work and Pensions gets its planned overhaul of back-to-work support right, meanwhile, it should help people to overcome barriers to finding a job, as the best local schemes already do – and these will often be barriers to wellbeing, too.I vividly remember the beaming faces of successful clients of Manchester’s Working Well scheme,whose Bolton outpost I visited two years ago, who had been helped to tackle huge challenges such as anxiety and to find a place for themselves back out in the world.Projects like these have a hard-nosed economic objective, of course, but there should be no shame in saying they are also aiming to make people happier and more satisfied with their lives.PBE’s chief economist, Jon Franklin, also points to social prescribing: an approach that can involve health professionals dispatching patients to clubs or activities, that might then help them to form bonds with others.There is a powerful case study in the PBE research that underlines the fact that good policy can improve wellbeing, despite it perhaps seeming to lie outside the realm of things politicians can affect.The research shows that private renters are especially likely to be in what PBE defines as “wellbeing poverty”, scoring four points or fewer on the life satisfaction question. One underlying factor they tease out is the anxiety-inducing insecurity that tenants experience.Recent legislation in Scotland that improved security of tenure has already started to close the wellbeing gap between private renters and everyone else, PBE finds. The renters’ rights bill currently passing through parliament in England should have a similar impact, though it won’t tackle another major cause of discontent for this group: unaffordable rents.There is nothing to prevent officials weighing up the wellbeing impact of proposed policies – indeed, there is Treasury guidance from 2018 that suggests it is one factor that should be taken into account.But there is no mention of repairing voters’ life satisfaction, or happiness, in Labour’s missions, orthe plan for change.That’s understandable, when the government is operating in straitened fiscal circumstances, and urgently needs to rekindle economic growth. Secure jobs and rising real wages are undoubtedly good for wellbeing.But a more direct focus on making the UK a happier place might help to improve decision-making. Franklin and his colleagues argue the data is now clear and consistent enough to make that possible.Instead, there is endless polling and focusing grouping of specific policies, discussion of which can become oddly detached from what they are likely to achieve.Labour has struggled to articulate its purpose to the public, and its number one mission, economic growth, is worthwhile but abstract (and judging by the past two months’ data, currently absent). Perhaps alongside the spreadsheets, it’s time to try a little happiness.Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyEconomics viewpointEconomic growth (GDP)Mental healthEconomicsHealthCoronavirusOffice for National StatisticscommentShareReuse this content"

He watched the Secret Service pile on the former US president. “I was able to see him standing and I could see the blood on his ear,” Marnell recalls.“When he put his fist up, I remember yelling, ‘Yes! Yes! Yes!’”Sunday marks one year since theassassination attempton Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and a week that changed US politics. Eight days later then-president Joe Biden, 81, dropped out of the election race amid concerns over his mental and physical decline.The twin shocks to the system of July 2024 continue to echo. Trump’s supporters hailed his survival as proof of divine intervention. He declaredin his inaugural addressin January: “I was saved by God to make America great again.” He has governed with a zealous self-belief that earns comparisons with authoritarians from history.Democrats, meanwhile, continue to wrestle the fallout of Biden’s late withdrawal. Some argue that he could have pushed on and won; most believe that he left the race too late andpaved the wayfor Trump’s return to the White House. Younger voters accuse the party establishment of betrayal and beat the drum of generational change.What few dispute is that the shooting of Trump was indicative of a culture of political violence that has taken hold over the past decade, with recent examples including the murder of a Minnesota politician and her husband. It also set in motion a news cycle that has barely drawn breath over the past year as the most unconventional president of modern times dominates the national consciousness.View image in fullscreenThe aftermath of the shooting injuring Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, on 13 July 2024.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APFor Marnell, who lives in San Diego, California,that hot summer’s day in Butler began like dozens of the other Trump rallies he has been to before and since. He was wearing a “brick suit” that symbolises the president’s border wall and looked up at a giant screen that displayed a chart detailing US-Mexico border crossings.Trump had his head turned to the right to review the graphic when the gunfire began and nicked his right ear. “I didn’t even recognise them as gunshots,” 60-year-old Marnell said in a phone interview. “I thought they might be firecrackers.”For several long seconds there was pandemonium. Firefighter Corey Comperatore was killed while David Dutch and James Copenhaver were both hospitalised with injuries.Secret Service agents killed the gunman, 20-year-old Thomas Crooks, whose motivesremain a mystery, and rushed on top of Trump, whose fate was initially uncertain.“There was every range of emotion in the crowd. There was anger. There were people who turned around and were yelling at the TV cameras. There were people who were in prayer. There were people crying. There were people who were in disbelief. It was just an incredible gamut and range of reactions.”But what happened next became the stuff of political legend. Trump rose, pumped his fist and beseeched his followers to “Fight! Fight! Fight” even as blood streaked his face. The resulting image flashed around the world and is still displayed in the West Wing and worn on T-shirts by his “Make America great again” (Maga) acolytes.Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank in Washington, said: “He showed courage and determination when you’d think the first thing somebody wants to do is slink away and save themselves. His response was to be the medieval chieftain who was rallying his troops round the banner and showing that he was undeterred to fight, to use his word. It was incredibly moving.”Biden was quick to call Trump and express sympathy. On 17 July, Biden tested positive for Covid-19. On 19 July, Trump, wearing a patch on his ear, delivereda 90-minute addressat the Republican national convention in Milwaukee, where some delegates wore ear patches in solidarity.Then, on 21 July, Biden suddenly announced that he was stepping aside and would not be the Democratic nominee for president. The writing had been on the wall since his disastrous debate performance against Trump the previous month. Party leaders such as Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer had urged him to withdraw. Finally, he yielded.View image in fullscreenTrump pumps his fist as he is rushed off stage.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APEven by the standards of the Trump era, it had been a jaw-dropping eight days.Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said: “There have been dramatic weeks and months but, in an election campaign, there’s just nothing like it in all of American history.”Journalist Chris Whipple was working on a different project when he heard the news of Biden’s exit, “realised this was the political story of the century”, and pivoted to writing a book that would becomeUncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History.“It created that devastating split screen between the strengths of Trump and the weakness of Biden,” Whipple said. “The image of Trump rising off that stage with blood on his cheeks and his fist in the air mouthing ‘fight, fight, fight’ was devastating in comparison to the image of Biden shortly thereafter climbing off Air Force One with Covid headed to his bunker in Rehoboth Beach, standing on those steps, looking lost and gripping the handrail.”In their new book2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America, journalists Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager and Isaac Arnsdorf write how Trump’s future chief of staff, Susie Wiles, told him after the assassination attempt: “You do know this is God.” At first Trump was silent, they write, but by the next day he was telling everyone: “If anyone ever doubted there was a God, that proved there was.”Numerous speakers at the Republican convention insisted that Trump had been spared by God so that he could pursue his mission. The Detroit pastor Lorenzo Sewell refers to it as a “millimetre miracle”.Whipple added: “To this day the true believers think this was God’s plan and maybe – without playing armchair psychologist – it’s contributed to a kind of fearlessness in Trump that I’m not sure we saw in the first term. Some might say recklessness. It changed Trump. It changed the country.”Conversely, the Democrats have still not recovered from the debacle of Biden’s late departure. His anointed successor, Kamala Harris, had only 107 days to campaign and ignited a burst of Democratic enthusiasm, notably at the party convention and whenshe debated Trump. But it was too little too late and she lost both the electoral college and the national popular vote.Whipple commented: “It was a seismic political event and the reverberations continue to this day. His 11th-hour abdication, leaving Kamala Harris with too short a runway to mount a winning campaign, obviously is historic and there is to this day a lot of anger amongDemocratsabout the fact that Biden should have stepped away a year earlier or more.View image in fullscreenTrump takes cover.Photograph: Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images“That has real political ramifications. We’re seeing it in thepopularity of ZohranMamdaniin New York and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders. It’s not just their message which is appealing to so many but also the fact that they’re anti-establishment. Biden and his gang have come to represent the corrupt Democratic establishment because of his last-minute abdication. You’re seeing an anti-establishment revolt.”Biden’s determination to cling on has been the subject of Democratic hand-wringing – and several books – though he insists he has no regrets. Many in the party wish he had stepped aside after the 2022 midterm elections so it could have held an open primary contest to find an heir apparent. Now Democrats find themselves leaderless and, according to a March poll, at a record lowapproval rating of 29%.Kurt Bardella, a Democratic strategist and political commentator, said: “The real fallout was the lack of a clear successor to President Biden.“Had there been a real primary process that would have been able to unfold over the course of a year and a half, it would have weeded out the contenders and pretenders and would have put forward a ticket that, even if they ended up losing, could still have been very much part of the conversation heading into 2028. Instead, we’re starting 2028 already behind.”How elections are won and lost is always complex. With inflation and immigration looming large, there is no guarantee that another Democratic candidate would have beaten Trump. Nor will it ever be known how determinative his made-for-TV response to the assassination attempt was. But it did have some important consequences.Within minutes of the shooting, Elon Musk, the tech billionaire,announced his endorsementof the former president. Musk would go on to spend a record of about $280m in backing Trump and Republican candidates, then lead the president’s assault on the federal bureaucracy until their spectacular falling-out.The Meta chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, alsopraised Trump’s reaction, calling his raised fist “one of the most badass things I’ve ever seen in my life”. Zuckerberg went on to attend Trump’s inauguration and make changes to Meta such as ending third-party fact-checking, removing restrictions on topics such as immigration and gender identity and bringing political content back to users’ feeds.The events of one year ago may also have shaped Trump’s psychology, fuelling an impatient, seize-the-day approach to the presidency that sets the news agenda at breakneck speed, knocks opponents back on their heels and brooks no compromise.Olsen said: “Trump dialed it up to 11 on his inauguration. A lot of that is the indirect influence of his survival of the assassination attempt. This is a man who is going with his instincts and going to do what he’s going to do and not going to prioritise – he’s going to push everything everywhere all at once.”Trump has survived legal troubles and taken on the elites and won, at least in his own mind, Olsen added. “I don’t think he thinks he’s invincible buthe feels vindicated. Coupled with a sense of vulnerability means this is a guy who knows that everything could end tomorrow and believes he’s been proven right, so he’s darn well going to use the time that he has left to him to move forward to do even more that he believes is right.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS politicsUS elections 2024Joe BidenRepublicansDemocratsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ahead of a new exhibition at Somerset House, our critic considers the meaning of art in a digital ageJonathan JonesSun 13 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Jul 2025 05.04 EDTShareIt’s the artist Qualeasha Wood who tells me about Snapchat dysmorphia, “a termcoined by plastic surgeonswho noticed there was a shift in the mid 2010s when people started bringing in their AI-beautified portraits instead of a celebrity picture”. To resolve your Snapchat dysmorphia, you get your real face remodelled to look like the ideal version of you that artificial intelligence has perfected on your phone screen.There is a fundamental problem with this, says Adam Lowe, whose Factum Foundation in Madrid is at the forefront of art and technology, digitally documenting artworks and cultural heritage sites around the world. When you have surgery to look like your best self as shown on a flat screen, the results in three-dimensional reality can be very odd indeed. You can feel Lowe’s sadness at the way plastic surgery botches human restoration in pursuit of screen perfection: “I have to look away,” he says.View image in fullscreenOn reflection … All for U (If U Rlly Want It) by Qualeasha Wood.Photograph: Qualeasha Wood/ Pippy Houldsworth GallerySuch are the paradoxes of the digital age explored inVirtual Beauty, an exhibition opening at London’s Somerset House on 23 July. The exhibition brings together more than 20 international artists to examine how artificial intelligence, social media and virtual identities reshape our understanding of beauty and self-representation in the digital age. It feels particularly resonant as the choice for Somerset House’s 25th anniversary of its public opening – the institution has borne witness to the complete transformation of how we present ourselves to the world. Wood herself stars – her artworks drag you into the heart of online life, juxtaposing her selfies with a ceaseless churning of texts, emails and layers of onscreen windows in montages that capture the restlessness of digital existence. But there’s a twist. Her snapshots of what it’s like to be a queer Black woman in the social media age are rendered as tapestries. In this older, more substantial medium, the grey frames of computer windows and harsh lettering of abusive messages become almost contemplative. And there is a hidden history here. Digitally controlled weaving is more than 200 years old: the Jacquard loom, invented in the Industrial Revolution, was programmed with punch cards telling what pattern to produce.“I was born in 1996 so the internet was already there,” says Wood. “My whole life has been mediated through that. I got my first computer at the age of five. At six I was online and playing games. The first game I ever played was The Sims, and it’s a life simulator. The first person I ever knew to die was my Sim, not a true human being.”View image in fullscreenMaking a splash … A Dream of Wholeness in Parts (still) by Sin Wai Kin (2021).Photograph: Sin Wai Kin/Chi-Wen Gallery, Taipei and Soft Opening, LondonAs an artist of the selfie age, one inspiration was Kim Kardashian. “Most of my upbringing on the internet involved using websites like Tumblr, just any image-based platform. Working in self-portraiture was really natural. I was looking at women like Kardashian who were very popular on the internet at that time – she even produced a selfie book.”The cyborg may soon  be a thing of the past, a vision of the future that is already getting oldKardashian’s 2015 book Selfish is a seminal moment in the rise of social media portraiture,not least for providing the template for “Instagram face”, the plumped up, feline aesthetic (the look was famously described as resembling a “sexy baby tiger”) that has come to dominate contemporary beauty standards. The more we shape and propagate our own images online, the more we feel compelled to copy that screen image in the flesh. Wood sees virtual beauty as “an era: it’s a marking of time, like BC and AD. There’s the beauty before technology and filters, and the beauty after. So much of beauty now isn’t about how you see yourself: we look instead at likes and metrics, and how much attention we are receiving or someone else is receiving.”Wood’s art shows how specific the glare of internet visibility is for her. One of her tapestries includes a string of aggressive online messages and her replies – “Qualeasha were you born to Crack head parents?” “Nope both military veterans!!” Among these brickbats, her physical image is by turns peaceful, melancholy, provocative. True beauty, she insists, does not lie in transforming yourself into an AI product.View image in fullscreenHuman in parts … Björk Virtual Avatars by Andrew Thomas Huang and James Merry (2017).Photograph: Andrew Thomas Huang/James Merry“I refuse to contribute to the beauty standard. Those works where I think I’m the least put together are the ones people are most drawn to and find the most beautiful.” Yet she admits she is not immune to the beauty ideals proliferating all around her. As an artist who shares her own life, she wonders how her image will change with time. “What will it be like when I’m 60 and have an older and less perfect body? Even now, I’m of that age when women start getting worked on.”Another piece in the exhibition plays off arguably one of the most famous bodies of all time. The pose is unmistakable. Even if you have never stood in front of Botticelli’sThe Birth of Venusin the Uffizi gallery in Florence, the way this nude goddess stands on a giant shell, legs curved yet with her upper body straight, one hand holding her long golden hair over her groin, another covering her right breast, will be familiar from its endless reproductions. But in the climactic scene of a film by Sin Wai Kin, Venus is played by the non-binary transgender artist in drag – nude drag – standing in white high heels on soaking wet rocks against crashing waves, flowers scattered around them like the painted flowers that delicately fall through Botticelli’s perfumed air.View image in fullscreenOut on a limb … Coexist by Arvida Byström (2022).Photograph: Arvida Byström“It’s the idea of the ideal of beauty,” Sin has said of this recreation of The Birth of Venus. In fact, more than 500 years ago, Botticelli knew that beauty was “virtual”. The 15th-century Florentine artist’s Venus floats towards you but never reaches you. The painting depicts not her birth but her arrival by seashell at the island of Cythera. Except however hard the wind gods puff, however tenderly an attendant waits to throw a robe around Venus, her feet never touch the shore. She is suspended for ever in this moment, both real and unreal.In our age of virtual beauty, people try more and more to cross the boundary between art and life. Once Oscar Wilde and the aesthetic movement aspired to make their lives as beautiful as art. They did it through pose and poise, as well as poetry and prose. Now we are physically resculpting ourselves to fit the perfect AI illusion of what we might be.The Somerset House show begins with Orlan, the French artist who underwent cosmetic surgery as performance art in the early 1990s. That radical remodelling of her body becomes a pioneering foretaste of an age in which biology is trumped by technology. Thus Filip Ćustić will show pi(x)el, a female silicone sculpture cast from life, her face covered in phone screens, on which other faces and bodies, including people bearing scars or visible disabilities, flow.

The optimistic vision of a new world where people can freely reinvent themselves from device to flesh could be seen as a contemporary restatement of Donna Haraway’s famous 1985 essay A Cyborg Manifesto (Sin Wai Kin has had Haraway quotes pinned up in their studio). Perhaps the most consoling interpretation of today’s emerging sci-fi reality is that, as Haraway argued, we are all becoming cyborgs – part human, part machine, liberated from the oppressive structures of the past.The stumbling block is, however, that the cyborg itself may be a thing of the past, a vision of the future that is already becoming old. Cyborg dreams assume that however much we change, however completely our bodies are remade or replaced, our minds will always be ours. The human brain will endure, even if it’s in a jar with robots doing the dirty work. However, in truth, we may be about to be outdone by other minds, and our bodies will be all we have left.View image in fullscreenNo person is an island … Virtual Embalming, Michèle Lamy by Frederik Heyman (2018).Photograph: Frederik Heyman“You get the sense that some kind of sentience is being nursed into life – but it’s happening away from us,” says Mat Collishaw, a digital artist who takes a much less human-centred view than the artists in Virtual Beauty. “We don’t really understand it. Even the guys that are building it, that are training it, don’t really know what’s happening. When you look into the eyes of a gorilla in the zoo you know there’s some sentience in there but it’s not ours: it’s a very weird feeling.”Although Collishaw started his career as one of the notoriously human Young British Artists of the 1990s, he has been working for several years with AI, and is now so immersed that OpenAI gives him pre-release software to test. His feeling that sentience is evolving in the machine is shared by some of the industry’s most respected minds. If you believeGoogle DeepMind’s Demis Hassabisor “godfather of AI”Geoffrey Hinton, in the next few years, machine learning will lead to artificial general intelligence that rapidly outdoes our feeble human brains. Most jobs will vanish. Humans will no longer invent or discover anything because machines will do it better.In his recent film Aftermaths, Collishaw uses AI to imagine how life might evolve all over again after we destroy ourselves. In the fuselage of a crashed plane and long-abandoned offices beneath the sea, shimmering invertebrates swim, sprouting tentacles and tails, reproducing and mutating, becoming more fishlike, then reptilian, as millions of years of evolution are condensed by his algorithms into a hypnotic vision of DNA’s inexhaustible ability to create new forms of life.View image in fullscreenImmersive vision … Aftermaths 9 by Mat Collishaw (2025).Photograph: Mat CollishawCollishaw unveiled Aftermaths in his recent exhibition Move 37 – a mysterious title unless you have followed the evolution of AI. In 2016 AlphaGo, an AI system created by Hassabis and his team, played the human Go master Lee Sedol. In their second game, AlphaGo won by playing Move 37 – a truly “creative” move, says the Google DeepMind website with pride in its clever child, that kindled a belief that inventive “thinking” machines are possible. Nine years on, Hassabis is among those who think artificial general intelligence is imminent. Collishaw, in all the hours he works intimately with AI, feels the presence of something unnameable. It is, he suggests, a mysterious submarine presence in the current AI systems, “not dissimilar from what’s happening in the dark watery depths in this film”.Something is coming up from the abyss. Is it virtual beauty? Or virtual horror? We are all seduced by the strange beauty of the internet: the speed at which you can see images, their high definition and fantastically vivid colours; there’s even the loveliness of the superbly designed devices on which we access this virtual abundance. Maybe the thinking machines, instead of wiping us out, will keep us as pampered pets, manipulating us with our gorgeous screens, insidiously enslaving us with ever new beauty obsessions.If so, the Virtual Beauty exhibition suggests they are well on the way, preparing a future in which we are all hedonist wastrels like the people in JG Ballard’s sci-fi story The Cloud-Sculptors of Coral D. Except rather than gliding through the clouds, we will incessantly resculpt ourselves to attain perfect, AI-curated beauty. At least it will be something to do.Virtual Beauty is at Somerset House, London,from 23 July to 28 September.Explore more on these topicsArtSocial mediaDigital mediaExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I am sorry,” he said, when asked about the planslaid outby Israel Katz last week. Once inside, Palestinians would not be allowed to leave, except to go to other countries, Katz said.Katz has ordered the military to start drawing up operational plans for construction of the “humanitarian city” on the ruins of southernGaza, to house initially 600,000 people and eventually the entire Palestinian population.“If they [Palestinians] will be deported into the new ‘humanitarian city’, then you can say that this is part of an ethnic cleansing. It hasn’t yet happened,” Olmert said. That would be “the inevitable interpretation” of any attempt to create a camp for hundreds of thousands of people, he said.Olmert did not consider Israel’s current campaign was ethnic cleansing because, he said, evacuating civilians to protect them from fighting was legal under international law, and Palestinians had returned to areas where military operations had finished.The “humanitarian city” project is backed by Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Israel’s refusal to withdraw from the area Katz envisages for the camp is a sticking point in thefaltering negotiationsfor a ceasefire deal, Israeli media have reported.Olmert said that after months of violent rhetoric, including calls from ministers to “cleanse” Gaza and projects to build Israeli settlements there, government claims that the “humanitarian city” aimed to protect Palestinians were not credible.View image in fullscreenOlmert, who led Israel from 2006 to 2009, called extremist cabinet ministers ‘the enemy from within’.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The Guardian“When they build a camp where they [plan to] ‘clean’ more than half of Gaza, then the inevitable understanding of the strategy of this [is that] it is not to save [Palestinians]. It is to deport them, to push them and to throw them away. There is no other understanding that I have, at least.”Israeli human rights lawyers and scholarshave describedthe plan as a blueprint for crimes against humanity andsome have warnedthat if implemented, “under certain conditions it could amount to thecrime of genocide”.Israeli defence minister’s Gaza proposal marks escalation from incitement of war crimes to official planning for mass forced displacementRead moreOther Israelis who have described the planned “humanitarian city” as a concentration camp have been attacked for invoking comparisons to Nazi Germany, when the government says it is designed to protect Palestinians. Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust memorial centre,accused one journalistof “a serious and inappropriate distortion of the meaning of the Holocaust”.Olmert, who led Israel from 2006 to 2009, spoke to the Guardian on the day funerals were held in the occupied West Bank for two Palestinian men, one an American citizen, who had beenkilled by Israeli settlers.The latest deaths came after a campaign of violent intimidation that has forced the residents of several villagesto flee their homesover the past two years.The attacks were war crimes, Olmert said. “[It is] unforgivable. Unacceptable. There are continuous operations organised, orchestrated in the most brutal, criminal manner by a large group.”The attackers are often called “hilltop youth” in Israel and described as fringe extremists. Olmert said he preferred the term “hilltop atrocities” to describe the young men whose campaign of spiralling violence was carried out with near-total impunity.“There is no way that they can operate in such a consistent, massive and widespread manner without a framework of support and protection which is provided by the [Israeli] authorities in the [occupied Palestinian] territories,” he said.Olmert described extremist cabinet ministers who backed violence in Gaza and the West Bank – where they have authorised major settlement expansions and control law enforcement with a view to expanding the borders of Israel – as a greater threat to the country’s long-term security than any external foe. “These guys are the enemy from within,” he said.Extreme suffering in Gaza and settler atrocities in the West Bank were fuelling growing anger against Israel that cannot all be written off as antisemitism, Olmert said.“In the United States there is more and more and more expanding expressions of hatred to Israel,” he said. “We make a discount to ourselves saying: ‘They are antisemites.’ I don’t think that they are only antisemites, I think many of them are anti-Israel because of what they watch on television, what they watch on social networks.“This is a painful but normal reaction of people who say: ‘Hey, you guys have crossed every possible line.’”Attitudes inside Israel might start to shift only when Israelis started to feel the burden of international pressure, he said, calling for stronger international intervention in the absence of serious political opposition at home. He also criticised the Israeli media for its failure to report on violence against Palestinians.View image in fullscreenOlmert said he could not refrain ‘from accusing this government of being responsible for war crimes’.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianOlmert backed the initial campaign against Hamas after the 7 October 2023 attacks. But he said that, by this spring, when the Israeli government “publicly and in a brutal manner” abandoned negotiations for a permanent end to fighting, he had reached the conclusion his country was committing war crimes.“Ashamed and heartbroken” that a war of self-defence had become something else, he decided to speak out. “What can I do to change the attitude, except for number one, recognising these evils, and number two, to criticise them and to make sure the international public opinion knows there are [other] voices, many voices in Israel?” he asked.He attributed what he called war crimes to negligence and a willingness to tolerate unconscionable levels of death and devastation, rather than an organised campaign of brutality. “[Did commanders] give an order? Never,” Olmert said.Instead, he believes the military looked away when things were done that would inevitably “cause the killing of a large number of non-involved people”. He said: “That is why I cannot refrain from accusing this government of being responsible for war crimes committed.”Despite the devastation in Gaza, as the last Israeli premier to seriously attempt to reach a negotiated solution with Palestinians, Olmert still hopes that a two-state solution is possible.He is working with the former Palestinian foreign minister Nasser al-Kidwa to push for one internationally, and even believes that a historic settlement could be in reach – an end to the war in Gaza in exchange for normalisation of ties with Saudi Arabia – if only Netanyahu was able or willing to take it.Instead Olmert was stunned to see Netanyahu, a man who has an arrest warrant for war crimes from the international criminal court,nominating Donald Trumpfor a Nobel peace prize.Additional reporting by Quique KierszenbaumExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warWar crimesPalestinian territoriesEhud OlmertBenjamin NetanyahuHuman rightsIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

But with last month’sfraught spending reviewover, he has turned his attention to an issue closer to his heart for his latest policy.“The council estate I grew up on was one of the neighbourhoods that was picked by the NewLabourgovernment because it was so deprived, essentially, in terms of income and educational outcomes,” he says.The 38-year-old MP for Bristol North West grew up in a flat on the Lawrence Weston estate. His mother was a hospital administrator and his father a security guard, and he has previously spoken about how money was sometimes tight at home. In his maiden speech in the House of Commons, he proudly mentioned being the first Darren to be an MP.Jones cites Labour support for local community group Ambition Lawrence Weston – still thriving today – as well as a taxpayer-funded “gifted and talented” scheme, as crucial in helping to signpost him towards university, as the first in his family to go. He went on to qualify as a solicitor, and was an in-house lawyer for BT beforebeing elected in 2017.With projects like these in mind, he is now announcing that the Treasury will invest £500m over a decade, alongside private backers, in a new “social outcome partnership” to fund grassroots projects tackling child poverty.He says he made it a personal mission since arriving in the Treasury last summer to dramatically expand this form of “social impact investment”.Pioneered by Gordon Brown’s Treasury, it is an approach that involves private investors matching taxpayer funding for neighbourhood-level anti-poverty projects.These backers earn a modest return, but only if the scheme meets specific targets – which might be, Jones says, getting a certain number of children into college, or university, or parents into secure jobs, for example. The fund is expected to be the largest such vehicle in the world. Jones hopes it will be worth £1bn in total.“It’s really trying to just unlock those opportunities, like it did for me,” he said. “I’ve now had a great career and I get to do this job. And a lot of that stems from what the New Labour government did. So essentially this type of funding mechanism, this investment into tackling the root causes of poverty is something that’s very personal to me.”The detailed proposal emerged from a social impact investment advisory group, set up by Jones last year. It was due to wind down this summer, but will now continue at his request, to draw up plans for a more general template for social impact projects, that could be applicable across Whitehall.The approach is of a piece with Jones’s relentless optimism that, despite governing in a time of straitened fiscal circumstances, this Labour government can find innovative ways to do more with less.“The public really want things to change and get better and we agree with that, but because we’ve inherited these really challenging economic circumstances, we can only do so much with the traditional mechanisms. So we’re open to trying to find other ways of getting stuff done for the country and improving people’s lives,” he says.That includes considering launching a new generation of public private partnerships, which the government hopes could be used to fund the newneighbourhood health centres, that are at the heart of Wes Streeting’s 10-year plan for the NHS.Jones insists these will be narrower and less complex than the controversial projects launched through the private finance initiative (PFI) under New Labour, some of which have saddled operators with hefty bills.“We are not doing PFI. We’re not doing that, these very complicated contracts. We’re not talking about hospitals or schools or prisons or anything like that.” But he added: “If there’s an innovative way of delivering a key objective for us, that’s what we’re trying to make happen.”For the same reason, he is a keen advocate of the wider use of AI in government, though he insists it must be “an enabling tool, not a replacement” for civil servants.While he is upbeat by temperament, Jones acknowledges the fearsome squeeze the government faces, in the week the Office for Budget Responsibility warned thatthe UK’s public finances are on an unsustainablecourse, and after his boss Rachel Reeves’stearful outing in parliamentsent bond markets reeling.“Debt is nearly 100% of GDP: it’s expensive, it costs a lot of money. We’ve had poor productivity growth and wage growth in the economy for the last 10 years. And so what the government, what Rachel’s trying to do is walk that tightrope out of that kind of fiscal headache,” he says.The ambitious Jones was touted by bookmaker Coral earlier this month as the second most likely successor to Reeves, after the Cabinet Office minister,Pat McFadden. But he is fiercely loyal to his boss, repeatedly underscoring the importance of her fiscal framework.“Fiscal rules are not self-constraining tools to just flagellate yourself with. They’re there for a reason,” he says.Why is Labour so afraid to admit that we must tax the rich? | Andy BeckettRead moreHe refuses to be drawn on the prospect of tax rises in Reeves’s autumn budget, which are widely expected, in the light of the U-turns over welfare cuts and the winter fuel allowance, and continued weakness in the economy.But he does repeat the chancellor’s promise that after the welfare cuts, “we’ll make sure that’s fully funded in a proper way at the budget” – but without jeopardising Labour’s manifesto promises not to touch the major revenue raisers of income tax, employee national insurance or VAT. “We’re going to honour our promises.”Challenged as to when voters will start to feel the benefits of Labour’s investments in infrastructure, housing and industry, Jones says the government will make no apology for taking a long-term view.But he also points to more immediate plans, set out in the spending review, to repair public buildings. “It’s not very sexy, but we put loads of extra money into maintenance,” he said.He then goes on an enthusiastic digression about how Labour’s long-term funding for pothole maintenance, in contrast to annual budgets under the Tories, will allow local authorities to “actually dig out the bit of the road that’s broken and relay it properly,” rather than just, “get the guys to come out and put tarmac in the hole”.Posing before the vast oil painting of Queen Victoria that dominates his airy Treasury office overlooking St James’s Park, Jones gives a final demonstration of his caution with public money. The imposing work was chosen from the government art collection by Jones’s predecessor, Laura Trott. He is not a big fan, he says. “I thought it would cost a fortune to get it out, which is the reason I left it.”Explore more on these topicsDarren JonesLabourRachel ReevesPat McFaddenChildrenPovertyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In Sinner’s case, the pain he endured simply made him stronger.One month on from the toughest night of his life on a tennis court, ­Sinner turned the tables at the earliest possible opportunity, demonstrating his resilience by recovering from a set down to win his firstWimbledontitle with a phenomenal performance, toppling the two-time defending champion, Alcaraz, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 6-4.‘Living my dream’: Sinner delights in Wimbledon triumph against AlcarazRead moreSinner is the first Italian player to win a Wimbledon singles title and he now stands as a four-time grand slam champion. He breaks his­overall tie with an assortment of famous names, including Arthur Ashe, Andy Murray and Stan Wawrinka. Perhaps most important, he ends his great rival’s run of five consecutive wins against him, adding a new dimension to a rivalry that seems set to decide the majority of major tournaments in the near future.In their own personal grand slam race, which still feels like it has only just begun, Sinner’s victory ensures that Alcaraz, who owns five major titles, remains within touching distance. This is also Sinner’s first slam title away from hard courts, after two victories at the Australian Open and last year’s US Open title.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz took the first set but could not repeat his heroics of the French Open final.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianA month ago, Sinner stared blankly into space from his seat on Court Philippe-Chatrier while Alcaraz celebrated his triumph in their French Open final with his family in the stands. Sinner held three championship points, the match on his racket, in the fourth set before losing one of the greatest grand slam finals in history. It is a reflection of the Italian’s tenacity and mental strength that the 23 year-old has found his path again so quickly.This is also Sinner’s first grand slam victory and overall title since his three-month doping ban between February and May. Sinner had tested positive for the banned substance clostebol last year before successfully arguing during his initial tribunal in August that the positive test had been a result of contamination, receiving no suspension. After the World Anti-Doping Agency chose to appeal the case, Sinner’s team and Wada eventually entered a case resolution ­agreement, essentially a ­settlement, agreeing on the three-month suspension.Quick GuideHewett dethroned by Oda in men's wheelchair finalShowBritain's Alfie Hewett lost his Wimbledon title to the world No 1, Tokito Oda, after an absorbing men's wheelchair final. The 27-year-old from Norwich, who won his first Wimbledon crown last year, was beaten 3-6, 7-5, 6-2 on a packed No 1 Court.Hewett was four from four on break points as he took the first set in 33 minutes. The defending champion broke Oda again as the 19-year-old from Japan, who beat Hewett in the 2023 final, served for the second set at 5-4. But Oda broke back before holding to level the match, and then went a double break up in the decider.Hewett saved two championship points on serve and another in the next game, but Oda converted his fourth to secure his second Wimbledon title after two hours and 16 minutes.\"Last year was obviously such a special moment for me, but I don't think trophies compare to this atmosphere and this kind of support,\" said Hewett. \"Congratulations to Tokito, it was a good battle out there and it's well deserved.\"PA SportWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Their three hours on Centre Court also showcased Sinner’s toughness. Despite how he frustratingly ended the first set, he kept on moving forward. Unlike a month earlier, Sinner played his best tennis in the decisive moments, serving brilliantly under pressure in the third set and maintaining his relentless aggression until the end, smothering the Spaniard with his constant pressure. Deep in the fourth set, as he faltered, this time Sinner held on.Aside from his bizarre fourth-round match, where Sinner hurt his elbow and trailed by two sets to Grigor Dimitrov before the Bulgarian was forced to retire, Sinner had undoubtedly performed at a higher, more consistent level than Alcaraz throughout the tournament. For once, Alcaraz could not find a way back in through the sheer force of his competitive spirit.Things had not started so well for Sinner. After establishing a 4-2 lead in the first set, the Italian watched his lead evaporate as Alcaraz reeled off four consecutive games, closing it off with an angled backhand slice winner at the very end of his range.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An unfocused start to the second set immediately left him trailing 0-40 and he eventually lost his serve. While his opponent’s level wavered, Sinner regained his rhythm on serve, which had faltered at the end of the first set, then he calmly continued to put Alcaraz under pressure on every point with his relentless aggression off both wings.The essential third set was ultimately decided by their serving under pressure. While Sinner saved some of his best serving for key moments, following up a searing 117mph second-serve ace at 3-4, 30-30 with another service winner to hold, Alcaraz faltered. The Spaniard lost rhythm on his first serve at the end of the subsequent game as Sinner fearlessly connected with two ­brilliant second-serve returns, snatching the set’s decisive break.The last time Sinner led two sets to one, all hell broke loose. He found himself at a similar crossroads while leading 4-3 in the fourth set as a series of nervous unforced errors sent him down 15-40. This time, he refused to let Alcaraz back in, digging himself out of a difficult hole and into the history books with the brand of bold, destructive shot-making that reinforced his status as the best player in the world.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Jannik SinnerCarlos AlcarazWimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

The king first suggested the possibility of a second such eventin February, delivered in the form of a letter by Keir Starmer during a meeting in the White House.The dates of the trip, however, avoid the prospect of the US president making an address to parliament.Other presidents, including Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, have made speeches to both houses of parliament, while the French president, Emmanuel Macron,did so last weekduring his first state visit. A Trump speech was likely to prove controversial, however, with some MPs having urged the House of Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, to refuse the US president the honour.Last week 15 Labour MPs and five others signeda parliamentary motioncalling on the speakers of both houses not to allow Trump to give a speech during the state visit. The MPs, who include Diane Abbott, Kate Osborne and Nadia Whittome, accused the president of “misogyny, racism and xenophobia”, criticising “his previous comments on women, refugees and torture”, as well as his stance on Ukraine.Peter Mandelson, the US ambassador, told the Sunday Times this weekend he believed Trumpshould be welcomed warmly on this visit.“He should expect a warm reception because he really does love Britain. He hugely admires it,”he said. “He trusts Keir Starmer. It’s not a question of expressing our gratitude. My lodestar here is to demonstrate respect, not sycophancy. I don’t think the administration has any problem with that.”Starmer has forged a productive relationship with Trump since coming to office,persuading the US presidentto lower tariffs on certain British goods, such as cars and aerospace equipment.But the prime minster is looking to secure further concessions, especially on steel exports. Steel and aluminium products are covered by the trade deal signed between the two men but are still subject to tariffs while the US administration asks further questions about UK supply chains.Mandelson told the Sunday Times the “universal 10% tariff” was unlikely to change, but added there was “scope” for negotiations in different sectors and industries, such as technology.Trump is a known admirer of the royal family, previously posting on his Truth Social platform: “I Love King Charles.” But even with the royal seal of approval and the possibility of a parliamentary address having been averted, the president’s visit provides ample opportunity for controversy.When he last visited the UK, tens of thousands of people protested against him on the streets of London. Trump responded with a social media tirade against the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, calling the Labour politician a “stone cold loser”.Trump also earned criticism for appearing to walk in front of the queen in what was interpreted as a breach of royal protocol.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpKing Charles IIIMonarchyHouse of CommonsnewsShareReuse this content"

Councils in Wales have thepower to quadruple taxes on second homes, whileEnglish councils can double taxes.The number of country houses coming on to the market was 9% higher in the second quarter of the year compared with last year.“Prices are correcting and as a result activity is noticeably picking up,” said James Cleland, the head of the country business at Knight Frank. “June was busy, and a number of deals were agreed in all price brackets, which means the next few months look even better for exchanges. It’s all about pricing. If you get it right, buyers pounce but if you get it wrong, not a lot happens.”Covid lockdowns prompted a wave of people to decide to move away from cities in favour of countryside homes five years ago – a trend that resulted in a“race for space” across the housing market.Demand, however, subsequently cooled. Average country house prices fell 3.5% in the three months to June, according to the estate agent’s price index. That was faster than the 1.6% decline in the year to March.Other factors in the glut of rural homes coming to market were a stock overhang caused by March’s stamp duty cliff edge, and buyers reactivating plans put on hold last year as a result of the political upheaval.Knight Frank said there were only 5.9 potential buyers for every new instruction to sell a country house, compared with nearly 19 at the peak of the pandemic exodus from cities. The last time buyers were in such a strong negotiating position was in the second quarter of 2018, during the turmoil over the UK’s Brexit deal with the EU under Theresa May’s Conservative government, it added.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The signal was recorded when it hit detectors on Earth sensitive enough to detect shudders in space-time thousands of times smaller than the width of a proton.“These are the most violent events we can observe in the universe, but when the signals reach Earth, they are the weakest phenomena we can measure,” said Prof Mark Hannam, the head of the Gravity Exploration Institute at Cardiff University. “By the time these ripples wash up on Earth they are tiny.”Evidence for the black hole collision arrived just before 2pm UK time on 23 November 2023 when two US-based detectors in Washington and Louisiana, operated by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (Ligo), twitched at the same time.View image in fullscreenThe Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (Ligo) detector.Photograph: Caltech/MIT/LIGO LabThe sudden spasm in space-time caused the detectors to stretch and squeeze for one tenth of a second, a fleeting moment that captured the so-called ringdown phase as the merged black holes formed a new one that “rang” before settling down.Analysis of the signal revealed that the colliding black holes were 103 and 137 times the mass of the sun and spinning about 400,000 times faster than Earth, close to the theoretical limit for the objects.“These are the highest masses of black holes we’ve confidently measured with gravitational waves,” said Hannam, a member of the Ligo scientific collaboration. “And they’re strange, because they are slap bang in the range of masses where, because of all kinds of weird things that happen, we don’t expect black holes to form.”Most black holes form when massive stars run out of nuclear fuel and collapse at the end of their life cycle. The incredibly dense objects warp space-time so much that they create an event horizon, a boundary within which even light cannot escape.View image in fullscreenGravitational wave signature detected at the two US instruments.Photograph: Caltech/MIT/LIGO LabPhysicists at Ligo suspect the black holes that merged were themselves products of earlier mergers. That would explain how they came to be so massive and why they were spinning so fast, as merging black holes tend to impart spin on the object they create. “We’ve seen hints of this before, but this is the most extreme example where that’s probably what’s happening,” Hannam said.Scientists have detected about 300 black hole mergers from the gravitational waves they generate. Until now, the most massive merger known produced a black hole about 140 times the mass of the sun. The latest merger produced a black hole up to 265 times more massive than the sun. Details are to be presented on Monday at theGR-Amaldi meetingin Glasgow.Before the first gravitational wave detectors were built in the 1990s, scientists could observe the universe only through electromagnetic radiation such as visible light, infrared and radio waves. Gravitational wave observatories provide a new view of the cosmos, allowing researchers to see events that were otherwise hidden from them.“Usually what happens in science is, when you look at the universe in a different way, you discover things you didn’t expect and your whole picture is transformed,” said Hannam. “The detectors we have planned for the next 10 to 15 years will be able to see all the black hole mergers in the universe, and maybe some surprises we didn’t expect.”Explore more on these topicsSpaceBlack holesPhysicsAstronomynewsShareReuse this content"

It was 90F (32C) in New Jersey, humid too, but oh, this was cold, all right.Two wonderful, almost identical strikes, executed with an effortless ease, and a lovely soft-shoed assist from Cole Palmer led Chelsea to the expandedClub World Cup. That Tiffany trophy, a great, big gold coin, had their name engraved into it alongside Gianni Infantino’s, the billion-dollar team that won the billion-dollar competition.Palmer’s casually jaw-dropping Club World Cup final show propels him into big time | Jacob SteinbergRead moreIt was handed to them by Donald Trump, who was booed when he appeared and hung about in the picture for a bit before Chelsea’s players pushed in front of him on the podium. Reece James lifted it, fireworks went off and Blue is the Colour went round. They had done it.Paris Saint-Germain had seemed peerless, a side that shifted the paradigm, butthe European championscould not beat Robert Sánchez at one end – the goalkeeper one of many outstanding performers – and were picked off at the other, victims of a perfect plan.This hadn’t been what PSG, or anyone, expected and at the final whistle they lost the plot, confrontations sparked on the pitch. Somewhere in the crowd, the coach Luis Enrique seemed to grab at João Pedro’s throat just as João Neves had grabbed at Marc Cucurella’s hair in the dying minutes of the match, their dreadful afternoon wrapped up with a red card.For Chelsea, it could not have gone any better, and almost from the start. Ultimately, they had won this inside 30 minutes, which is what their opponents were supposed to do.“We know that they begin games very fast, very strong,” Cucurella had said but while Ousmane Dembélé almost caught Sánchez 95 seconds in, it was Chelsea who did so. The first chance was theirs inside 10 minutes and it was so close that some in this stadium celebrated, João Pedro teeing up Palmer for a shot that bent just past the post. That, it turned out was just a sighter; next time, the MetLife could let go for real.View image in fullscreenJoão Neves (right) was sent off for pulling Marc Cucurella’s hairPhotograph: Jose Breton/NurPhoto/ShutterstockChelsea’s plan was clear: quick into the challenge, quicker to send the ball into the space behind PSG, starting with Sánchez directly from his own area. PSG might have led early when Désiré Doué cut back to Kvaratskhelia instead of taking the shot himself before seeing another effort stopped by a superb low save from Sánchez.It was also true that they took a degree of control in that phase and beyond, possession eventually up near 70% but Chelsea had anticipated that and the advantage was quickly theirs, 1-0 up on 22 minutes.Sánchez’s diagonal went right where Nuno Mendes, buffeted, didn’t judge the leap well. Suddenly, Malo Gusto was away, space opening on the wing before him and he cut into the area, ready to shoot. Lucas Beraldo blocked the first effort but Gusto retrieved the ball and laid into the path of Palmer who opened up his body and curled it into the bottom of the net. Off he went, holding himself.The shot with which he made it 2-0 eight minutes later was almost identical. Coming in from the right, Palmer saw Gusto fly up outside him. So, and this was the key, did the PSG defence. A slight pause, a little shuffle of the hips was enough to clear Beraldo and Marquinhos from his path and Palmer put the ball in the same square of the net. In half an hour, he had taken almost the same shot three times. Two had gone in, the other looked like it had, the title within touching distance already.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Just before half-time, he carried the ball from near halfway and slipped the ball through. The pass was smooth, so was the finish from João Pedro, dinked over Gigi Donnarumma as if he was playing on the beach, which 10 days ago he was.Trump booed but unbowed at Club World Cup final as Chelsea lift trophyRead moreChelsea had completed only 126 passes at that point, but that was at least partly by clinical design, producing three shots clearly constructed and calmly executed, giving them a lead that wasn’t for overturning. Which isn’t to say PSG didn’t try after a 24-minute half-time. Sánchez almost immediately had to get to the feet of Fabián Ruiz and then scramble away Kvaratskhelia’s shot before making an excellent close-range stop from Dembélé.Chelsea got deeper and were not always in a hurry to get the ball back. When they did, they tried to keep it, each pass greeted witholés, the match managed expertly. Sánchez dived to save Vitinha’s dipping effort but only rarely did Chelsea feel under the kind of pressure that would prise the trophy from their hands.In fact, if anyone was going to score again, it was Liam Delap, who twice went close, as down the on the bench the T-shirts were handed out.

Could theCity of Londonbecome a global hub of nocturnal revelry?With financial districts struggling to bounce back to full capacity post-Covid, and the nightlife industry facing an existential crisis, there are suggestions clubs could move into deserted office blocks at evenings and weekends.In its annual eccentric report on the future of leisure, the creative studio Bompas and Parr says it envisions “a future where financial districts inLondonand the world over are transformed into world-class late-night party zones”.“By day, the city bustles with suits and stocks. By night, it’s reborn as a pulsating rave arena,” the report says. “With few residents to file noise complaints, organisers capitalise on the empty, echoing canyons of glass and steel.“Empty office lobbies become sought-after DJ booths, rooftops host industry defining light shows, and any space that isn’t locked morphs into a dancefloor to create a sprawling web of passionate chaos as capitalism and counterculture merge.”It may sound far-fetched, but it could become reality as the corporate and hospitality industries respond to changing behaviour in a post-Covid world.Michael Kill, the chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA), said the prospect of few noise complaints and the need to boost footfall in areas that workers have deserted in the shift to work from home made it an appealing prospect.“There are conversations going on about things like the City of London, where the financial district is, as there is a very limited residential core so without a doubt, given some of the noise complaints and restrictions, that actually makes sense and works for nightlife,” Kill said.View image in fullscreenCyclists on Threadneedle Street on a quiet Friday morning; many people are choosing to work from home on Mondays and Fridays.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The ObserverAbout 500,000 people work in the City of London but only 8,500 people live there, reducing the likelihood of noise complaints from residential properties, something that hasproven a hindrance for venuesin recent years.Kill said some financial districts were struggling with the impact of having only “three core days with full workforce”, as many people were choosing to work from home on Mondays and Fridays.“What we’ve always had with the financial districts is, after a Friday night, they close down and everyone disappears,” he said. “But now we’re seeing people only work from the office for about three days a week. Friday has become an extension of the weekend. So landlords are obviously looking for new opportunities, and that is a very constructive conversation we’re having.”He said there were conversations about how zoning rules could be adjusted to give “preferential planning and licensing opportunities” to nightlife and hospitality businesses in financial areas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The number of nightclubs hasmore than halved between 2013 and 2024. The rate of decline was exacerbated by the pandemic, when clubs were shut for months on end and more than a third of the country’s venues closed for good.The industry was continuously adapting to entice people back to the dancefloor and ensure the sector’s survival, Kill said, with everything from “light clubbing to full-fat clubbing to hybrid spaces and the evolution of venues with multifaceted options like conference spacing”.Bompas and Parr predicted that capitalising on the over-50s market would be key, and that the “generation that pioneered sex, drugs, and rock’n’roll” would be seeking new ways to spend their spare time.Kill said: “What we’ve seen is the industry, in many respects, has been propped up by an older generation that are plugged into revisiting those club culture memories, rave memories, events memories. The reality is, all they want to do is go out and revisit their youth.“So it’s absolutely something that is happening and is a growing market that is without a doubt now being noticed by the sector as a whole as a big opportunity.”Explore more on these topicsHospitality industryLondonPlanning policyClub cultureCity of LondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

A realistic future military and diplomatic strategy for Kyiv has to accept that fact – and formulate a new approach.The past six months have been dominated by the erroneous assumption that it would be possible for Trump to negotiate a ceasefire, even an armistice. That would be followed by the arrival of an Anglo-French led stabilisation force to secure the future of Ukraine. But Putin has shown no desire to stop attacking.A fresh Russian ground offensive is emerging towards Velykyi Burluk, 50 miles east of Kharkiv, and for now is making some rare gains: three miles in 10 days. More significantly, the cynical bombing of Ukraine’s cities by missile and drone is only intensifying, straining Kyiv’s air defences and leading to more civilian casualties.A record 728 Shahed drones and 13 missiles were launched on the night of 8 July and the next morning, many at Lutsk in the west, though the bombardment of 597 drones and 26 missiles on Friday night and Saturday morning showed no slackening of violent intent. It will be soon possible for Russia to attack with 1,000 drones in a night, Ukraine believes.Ina paper written last month, Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defence minister, said “an acceptable armistice may never formally arrive” and that Kyiv should formulate “a revised theory of victory” – which accepts that the Kremlin considers itself engaged in a forever war against its smaller neighbour.The former minister describes the new approach as “strategic neutralisation”, a permanent and dynamic military effort to ensure that Russia’s forces cannot advance and that Moscow becomes “operationally incapable of disrupting key aspects of Ukrainian strategic, political, economic, and social life”.It accepts that Ukraine cannot retake territories already occupied by Moscow, or attack again into Russia, as happened into Kursk oblast last summer, and instead pursues an active defence.As an example for what might be possible, Zagorodnyuk refers to the situation in the Black Sea. Ukraine, which began the war without a navy, had managed to box in the Russian Black Sea fleet by mid-2023 by successfully sinking and threatening to sink warships with remotely piloted sea drones.The result is the “functional defeat” of the Russian fleet, a phrase first used by a former British junior defence minister, James Heappey. Kyiv was able to unilaterally reopen a corridor for grain shipments from Odesa and nearby areas in 2023 without having to negotiate a special exemption for such traffic with Russia.One question is whether strategic neutralisation is possible on land. Russia has struggled to gain territory inside Ukraine during 2025, though it has collapsed the Kursk pocket, and its forces incurred casualty rates (killed and wounded) of about 1,100 a day in June – showing that Kyiv can roughly hold the line largely with the help of £300-£370 ($400-$500) first-person view (FPV) drones that it can manufacture in bulk.But the strategy goes further. The military aim in such a plan would be to extend the depth of FPV drone operations to 25, 50 or even 100 miles – to create a zone where it is effectively impossible for Russian forces to mass – and even to walk to the frontline. Rather than create a Korean style demilitarised zone, the effect would be to create a highly militarised zone in which Russian forces could not operate, a de facto border.The already slow rate of Russian advance suggests this approach may be possible, though an important question is what will happen once the last of the US military aid approved by former president Joe Biden tails off. It is also challenged by Russia’s expanding volume of missile and drone attacks – which in turn come at a time of growing concern about the amount of available air defence interceptors.A series of ill-judged signals from the US reveal that the Pentagon is worried about the number of Patriot air defence missiles it has available, probably the single most important air defence system used by Ukraine. Weapons deliveries were halted at the end of last month amid fears US stockpiles were low (perhaps at 25% of the desired levels), though Trump has partially relented, sending a symbolic 10 Patriot missiles last week.The US president, finally acknowledging that Putin is stalling, has promiseda “major announcement” on Monday, which may involve extra sanctions on Russia and allowing European countries to buy more weapons for Kyiv. It would make strategic sense if whatever is offered comes with the recognition that Putin is not serious about peace – and gives Ukraine what it needs to neutralise the aggressor.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

My elderly parents were desperate to attend the big wedding but as they were both in their 80s, they’d decided it would be more comfortable to take a cruise ship from Australia to Europe than to fly. They’d set off two months before the rest of us.Mum’s message asked me to call her. “We’re being thrown off the ship,” she wrote. “Your father’s in an ambulance – I think it’s pneumonia. We’re somewhere in Spain.”They were admitted to a tiny hospital in a small place called Los Álamos, near Málaga. Mum didn’t have data on her phone, nor did she know how to get an e-sim or a new sim card.The only time I would hear from her was when she managed to get on to the patchy hospital wifi.The kindness of strangers: I used to hate being judged, but then a woman on a train praised my parentingRead moreLast we’d spoken, she’d told me Dad was in a critical condition. But because the hospital staff spoke very limited English, they hadn’t been able to communicate anything else, so Mum didn’t really understand what was going on – only that she wasn’t allowed to see him.She was beside herself with stress.I quickly moved the date of my flight forward to go and find them. Before I left, unable to get on to Mum to let her know I was coming, I had an idea. I found a Facebook group called Expats Málaga and joined, posting there that my father was in the local hospital and my mother doesn’t speak Spanish. Would someone be able to visit and let her know her daughter is on her way from Australia?A wonderful lady named Elizabeth responded straight away to say she lived near the hospital and would be happy to go. Mum later told me that a very tall, stylish blond woman popped her head into the hospital waiting room and said: “Excuse me, are you Maureen? My name’s Elizabeth. Your daughter sent me.”Mum said she immediately burst into tears. She told Elizabeth she just wanted to speak to her children but couldn’t get her phone to work. So in 44C heat – Spain was having a horrendous heatwave – Elizabeth went and bought a new sim card for my mum and installed it on her phone. She spoke to the nurses and got a positive update on my dad’s health, which she relayed to Mum.I never got to meet Elizabeth, but we had beautiful correspondence – I wrote her a very heartfelt message saying how much I appreciated her kindness and support.I eventually got to Spain, and Mum and I had a week together in the hospital helping Dad get better. He recovered and my parents made it to the wedding, which was beautiful. The ridiculous thing is, it’s two years later, and guess what they’re doing?

Our research shows that a small number of divisive accounts could be responsible – and offers a way outJay Van BavelSun 13 Jul 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Jul 2025 11.26 EDTShareWhen I scroll through social media, I often leave demoralized, with the sense that the entire world is on fire and people are inflamed with hatred towards one another. Yet, when I step outside into the streets of New York City to grab a coffee or meet a friend for lunch, it feels downright tranquil. The contrast between the online world and my daily reality has only gotten more jarring.Since my own work is focused on topics such as intergroup conflict, misinformation, technology and climate change, I’m aware of the many challenges facing humanity. Yet, it seems striking that people online seem to be just as furious about thefinale of The White Lotusor the latest scandal involving a YouTuber. Everything is either the best thing ever or the absolute worst, no matter how trivial. Is that really what most of us are feeling? No, as it turns out. Our latest research suggests that what we’re seeing online is a warped image created by a very small group of highly active users.In apaperI recently published with Claire Robertson and Kareena del Rosario, we found extensive evidence that social media is less like a neutral reflection of society and more like a funhouse mirror. It amplifies the loudest and most extreme voices while muting the moderate, the nuanced and the boringly reasonable. And much of that distortion, it turns out, can be traced back to a handful of hyperactive online voices. Just 10% of users produce roughly 97% of political tweets.Let’s take Elon Musk’s own platform, X, as an example. Despite being home to hundreds of millions of users, a tiny fraction of them generate the vast majority of political content. For instance, Musk posted1,494 timesin his first 15 days of implementing government cuts for the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge)earlier this year. He was, essentially, writing non-stop. And many of his posts spread misinformation to his 221 million followers.On 2 February he wrote, “Did you know that USAID, using YOUR tax dollars, funded bioweapon research, including Covid-19, that killed millions of people?” His behaviour fits the pattern of many misinformation super-spreaders. A mere 0.1% of users share 80% of fake news. Twelve accounts – known as the“disinformation dozen”– created most of the vaccine misinformation on Facebook during the pandemic. These few hyperactive users produced enough content to create the false perceptions that many people were vaccine hesitant.Many of us are led to believe that society is far more polarized, angry, and deluded than it really isSimilar patterns can be observed across the internet. Only a small percentage of users engage in truly toxic behaviour, but they’re responsible for a disproportionate share of hostile or misleading content on nearly every platform, from Facebook to Reddit. Most people aren’t posting, arguing, or fuelling the outrage machine. But because the super-users are so active and visible, they dominate our collective impression of the internet.That means the resulting problems don’t remain confined to this small cohort, which distorts how the rest of us make sense of the world. Humans create mental models about what other people think or do. It’s how we figure out social norms and navigate groups. But on social media, this shortcut backfires. We don’t get a representative sample of opinions. Instead, we see a flood of extreme, emotionally charged content.In this way, many of us are led to believe that society is far more polarized, angry, and deluded than it really is. We think everyone on the other side of the generation gap, political spectrum, or fandom community is radical, malicious, or just plain dumb. Our information diet is shaped by a sliver of humanity whose job, identity, or obsession is to post constantly.This distortion fuels pluralistic ignorance – when we misperceive what others believe or do – and can shift our own behaviour accordingly. Think of voters who see only the angriest hot takes about immigration or climate change and assume there’s no common ground to be found.The problem isn’t just the individual extremists, of course – it’s the platform design and algorithms that amplify their content. These algorithms are built to maximise engagement, which means they privilege content that is surprising or divisive. The system is optimised to promote the very users who are most likely to distort our shared perception of reality.It gets worse. Imagine you’re sitting in a busy restaurant, having to speak a little louder just to be heard. Before long, everyone is shouting. These same dynamics happen online. People exaggerate their beliefs or repeat outrageous narratives to get attention and approval. In other words, even people who aren’t especially extreme may start acting that way online, because it gets rewarded.Most of us aren’t spending time on our phones trolling our foes. We’re busy working, raising families, spending time with friends, or simply trying to find some harmless entertainment on the internet. Yet, our voices are drowned out. We have effectively handed over a megaphone to the most obnoxious people and let them tell us what to believe and how to act.With over5 billion people now on social media, this technology isn’t going away. But the toxic dynamic I’ve described doesn’t have to hold sway. The first step is to see through the illusion and understand that a silent majority often lurks behind each incendiary thread. And we, as users, can take back some control – by curating our feeds, resisting the outrage bait, and refusing to amplify the nonsense. Think of it like deciding to follow a healthier, less processed diet.In arecent series of experiments, we paid people a few dollars to unfollow the most divisive political accounts on X. After a month, they reported feeling 23% less animosity towards other political groups. In fact, their experience was so positive that nearly half the people declined to refollow those hostile accounts after the study was over. And those who maintain their healthier newsfeed reported less animosity a full 11 months after the study.Platforms could easily redesign their algorithms to stop promoting the most outrageous voices and prioritise more representative or nuanced content. Indeed, this iswhat most people want. The internet is a powerful, and often valuable tool. But if we keep letting it reflect only the funhouse mirror world created by the most extreme users, we’ll all suffer the consequences.Jay Van Bavelis a professor of psychology at New York University.Further readingThe Righteous Mindby Jonathan Haidt (Penguin, £12.99)Going Mainstreamby Julia Ebner (Ithaka, £10.99)The Chaos Machineby Max Fisher (Quercus, £12.99)Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaThe big ideaPsychologyInternetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The villa is the same, overly lit and filled with dumb neon signs, looking like it was exclusively decorated by Target (the contestants are still obliged to call it beautiful as they enter, leaving audiences wondering if they are told by producers to do so). There is the same introduction of personalities that at first seem complex and different, only for everyone to fall into a high school trance once they start vying to be chosen. There is the same suspension of any kind of reality for the most part, in which the contestants rarely discuss the real-world implications of their lives, such as their jobs and living situations.But this summer saw Love Island USA truly take off, breakingratings recordsand storming social media (new viewers reportedly made up 39% of the season 7 audience). Peacock, the NBC-owned streamer, boasted that the show was the most talked about TV event of the season with 623m video views on TikTok. Yet in the UK, the original has beenstruggling, with ratings lows. Perhaps it’s down to fatigue, with the show having been around almost twice as long overseas. At the same time the US equivalent has been boosted by an overall rise in interest for live event TV (the past year has also seen awards showsreceive an upliftin viewers) and the past weeks have seen Love Island watch parties crop up in bars across the country. But why now?‘Oh my God sir, you’re on Love Island!’ What happens to teachers who do reality TV?Read moreIt has all of the same horny plot twists we expect, but this season somehow grew a heart. The antics are still as naughty, but the sexy singles of the villa are honest about what they want (at least until they start coupling up). And what they want is genuine intimacy fueled by emotional vulnerability and availability. People seem to be actually looking for real love, long-term commitment, seeking people with real partner potential, and even discussing having children in a deep way. Add on the complexity of one of the contestants Huda having a daughter, and the fearful way she navigates the topic, and you have people being real for once on a very unreal show.Part of the allure of this season is that gen Z has finally taken the torch of what millennials started (and I say that as a very exhausted millennial). These contestants are fluent in gen Z-speak. They say “dead ass”, “type shit”, “be so for real”, “hits different”, and “tea” as if no one didn’t ever know what those words meant. They are covered in tattoos and piercings, and no one bats an eye. These people grew up with social media, and it shows – and somehow, instead of being entirely off-putting, it’s more relatable than the millennials who came before them, who were constantly angling for the camera’s attention while overthinking how they were coming off in the public eye. There’s an effortlessness of this new young generation who came of age so filmed by their own phone cameras that they don’t seem as concerned with the production crew’s POV, or even the fact that they’re being watched. The ennui and cultural frustration of millennials is eclipsed by gen Z women who don’t feel the need to go so high glam with their style, and men who are excited to talk about their feelings. It’s a refreshing energy.View image in fullscreenMichelle ‘Chelley’ Bissainthe, Olandria Carthen, Iris Kendall, Amaya Espinal and Huda Mustafa.Photograph: Peacock/Kim NunneleyIt all translates into a collective self-awareness that while they could become famous just by being there, and especially by staying on as long as possible, showing any interest in that is off-putting and will get them kicked off and also disowned by the public. This is probably informed by watching online backlash against other reality dating show contestants in the last few years who were exposed for being there just for fame, but also feels like a generational shift. This generation is also far more mental-health aware, and watched as the early seasons of the UK show were tragically plagued by suicide and mental health crises, and it has helped to create islanders who avoid the pitfalls that they can trip into in approaching the game for fame or by being emotionally ugly (getting cliquey, being blatantly disloyal, trying to pull focus, being overtly manipulative). They have become smarter about how they come off on camera by not playing into it at all. Authenticity is king in this generation. No one is pretending to be smarter or hotter than they are. And they don’t necessarily seem to be comparing themselves to one another, more just not wanting to feel rejected. It helps that the format ofLove Islandis almost real-time, with just a 24-48 hour delay from filming to air. It reduces the noxious vibes of over-produced reality TV that everyone at this point knows is anything but real.This season has also seen some controversy with contestants being kicked off. Yulissa Escobar was axed unceremoniously in the first week after an old podcast episode resurfaced in which she had used the N-word. She apologized for the comment on her social media accounts, but alsocritiqued the online backlash against heras “cancel culture”. Cierra Ortega left last week with narrator Iain Stirling saying she “left the villa due to a personal situation”, after two social media posts circulated in which she’d used a slur against people of Asian descent. As opposed to Escobar, Ortega has apologized profusely, with her family evenputting out a statementbefore she returned home about the harm they were afraid the mass, vocal backlash against their daughter could cause to her mental health.As the season comes to a close this weekend, producers were alsoreportedly upsetwith OG islander Huda, who is in the finale to potentially win the prize, for posting a TikTok lip-syncing to a Elijah The Boy’s Over You, for a portion that includes the N-word. She will apparently not be kicked off ahead of the finale, but was pulled aside by producers and admonished and asked not to cause any more controversy for the brand or herself. The lack of self-awareness certainly has a downside for these gen Z’ers who have lived their youths sometimes regrettably too online. But at the same time, it’s part of what stokes viewers. With the rise of shows like The Traitors, also reaching a record audience in the US, it seems people are wanting a return to a messier brand of reality TV.View image in fullscreenChris Seeley and Huda Mustafa.Photograph: Ben Symons/APWhere does the present-day Love Island obsession come from? Is it just wanting to get away from the crushing reality of the geopolitical climate? There’s no longer a layer of disdain for young TV dummies grinding on each other just to get internet famous. Love Island isn’t just a guilty pleasure or a hate watch anymore. Now we are rooting for them. We want them to win. We wish we could be them, or be there for them. When they say they’re there for “girls girls and soul connections”, we believe them. A day after talking about how the show was a salve for our chaotic times with a friend, I saw a meme of the2023 Barbenheimersummer box office moment, with an image of Margot Robbie’s Barbie looking out over Barbieland next to an image of Cillian Murphy’s Oppenheimer looking out over an atomic wasteland with the text overlay “Watching Love Island while simultaneously watching WWIII start.” It’s how we all feel, like a meme of the world wrapped into a person who just wants to live.The biggest appeal of Love Island has always been the quickness with which these people will couple up and catch feelings for each other after mere hours together, and then turn around and transmute that into the same thing with someone new whom they just met. There’s something wildlydeluluabout it, but also kind of how we all want to be loved – for it to be instant. For someone to pick us. For someone not to want to take it too slow. For someone to make us feel easily chosen for the long haul. The bonding exists entirely in this neon, sexed up faux paradise where the pressures of the real world don’t exist (what we all wish we could return to). It’s a sleepaway camp for adults with the promise of global attention, and the joint potential for a soul mate and a cash prize. Take that original recipe and add in this new gen Z natural charisma and lack of anxiety around being vulnerable, garnish with universal trauma around the state of the world, and you have the perfect storm to lose months of your life watching a single season of this show. Happily ever after for us all.Explore more on these topicsLove IslandUS televisionTelevisionReality TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Illustration: Victoria Hart/Guardian designDo you scream when you stub your toe? Could you play a grand final with a shattered jaw, or work all day as your belly fills with blood? When it comes to suffering, perspective is everythingByCelina RibeiroSun 13 Jul 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Jul 2025 21.31 EDTShareSome say it was John Sattler’s own fault. The lead-up to the 1970 rugby league grand final had been tense; the team he led, theSouth Sydney Rabbitohs, had lost the 1969 final. Here was an opportunity for redemption. The Rabbitohs were not about to let glory slip through their fingers again.Soon after the starting whistle, Sattler went in for a tackle. As he untangled – in a move not uncommon in the sport at the time – he gave the Manly Sea Eagles’ John Bucknall a clip on the ear.Seconds later – just three minutes into the game – the towering second rower returned favour with force: Bucknall’s mighty right arm bore down on Sattler, breaking his jaw in three places and tearing his skin; he would later need eight stitches. When his teammate Bob McCarthy turned to check on him, he saw his captain spurting blood, his jaw hanging low. Forty years laterSattler would recall that moment. One thought raged in his shattered head: “I have never felt pain like this in my life.”But he played on. Tackling heaving muscular players as they advanced. Being tackled in turn, around the head, as he pushed forward. All the while he could feel his jaw in pieces.At half-time the Rabbitohs were leading. In the locker room, Sattler warned his teammates, “Don’t play me out of this grand final.”McCarthy told him, “Mate, you’ve got to go off.”He refused. “I’m staying.”Ouch! Solving the riddle of painRead moreSattler played the whole game. The remaining 77 minutes. At the end, he gave a speech and ran a lap of honour. The Rabbitohs had won. The back page of the next day’s Sunday Mirror screamed “BROKEN JAW HERO”.A photograph of Sattler, his heavy green and red jersey rolled up to the elbows, the neck grubby with blood, his mangled swollen jaw, carried on the shoulders of teammates, has become one of Australian sport’s most well-known images. His grand final performance has been hailed as“the most famous show of playing through pain in Australian sporting history”. Sattler, inextricably linked to the jaw he ultimately had to have wired back together, for decades hence was lauded for his courage, celebrated as one of the toughest men to have played the game.Because John Sattler could withstand the pain.How can a person bitten by a shark calmly paddle their surfboard to safety, then later liken the sensation of the predator clamping down on their limb to the feeling of someone giving their arm“a shake”? How is it that a woman can have a cyst on her ovary burst, her abdomen steadily fill with blood, but continue working at her desk for six hours? Or that a soldier can have his legs blown offthen direct his own emergency treatment?Each one of us feels pain. We all stub our toes, burn our fingers, knock our knees. And worse. The problem with living in just one mind and body is that we can never know whether our six out of 10 on the pain scale is the same as the patient in the chair next to us.About one in five adults experience chronic pain; it can be debilitating and patients have beenhistorically dismissed, disrespected and under-treated. Acute pain is different; it’s short periods of pain usually associated with an injury, illness or tissue damage. Because all humans experience acute injury or illness, we each have a sense of our pain response. Many of us wonder, “Do I have a high pain threshold?” And we have each at some point been asked – by a doctor, by a nurse, by a teammate – “What’s your pain on a scale of one to 10?”3:08What is chronic pain and how does it work? – video explainerThe ability of some people to experience serious injury without appearing to feel serious pain has been fodder for legend and research for centuries. Withstanding pain has been heralded as heroism or a freakish anomaly.But what is happening in the body and mind of a person who does not seem to feel the pain they “should” be feeling. Do we all have the capacity to be one of these heroic freaks?And how did John Sattler play those 77 minutes?Questions like these rattled around the mind of Lorimer Moseley when he showed up at Sydney’s Royal North Shore hospital years ago as an undergraduate physiotherapy student. He wanted to interrogate a quip made by a neurology professor as he left the lecture theatre one day, that the worst injuries are often the least painful. So Moseley sat in the emergency room and watched people come in, recording their injuries and asking them how much they hurt.“And this guy came in with a hammer stuck in his neck – the curly bit had got in the back and was coming out the front and blood was pouring all down,” Moseley recalls. “But he was relaxed. He just walked in holding the hammer, relaxed. Totally fine.”Then the man turned around, hit his knee on a low table and began jumping up and down at the pain of the small knock.“And I think, ‘Whoa, what is happening there?’”The curious student ruled out drugs, alcohol, shock. He realised that the reason the man did not feel pain from his hammer injury was due to the very point of pain itself.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads“Pain is a feeling that motivates us to protect ourselves,” says Moseley, now the chair in physiotherapy and a professor of clinical neurosciences at the University of South Australia.“One of the beautiful things about pain is that it will motivate us to protect the body part that’s in danger, really anatomically specific – it can narrow it right down to a tiny little spot.”It is an evolutionary self-protection response that meant the man with the hammer in his neck did not appear to feel pain. To feel pain would not have aided his survival in that moment, Moseley says. Instead, fear is probably what impelled him to race to the emergency ward.“So these people on the battlefield, their arm gets ripped off, they look for their arm, they pick it up, they walk to safety, no arm pain. Perfect. That is an extraordinarily bold and sophisticated protective system.”Of course pain is in your head. It’s in your brain. You know, it’s the brain that is where you get that experienceLorimer MoseleyProf Michael Nicholas is used to stories like these. “You can see it in probably every hospital ward. If you stay around long enough you’ll hear comments like ‘this person has more pain than they should have’ or ‘you might be surprised that they’re not in pain’,” he says. “What that highlights to me is the general tendency for all of us to think there should be a close relationship between a stimulus like an injury or a noxious event and the degree of pain the person feels.“In fact, that’s generally wrong. But it doesn’t stop us believing it.”The reason we get it wrong, Nicholas says, “is that we have a sort of mind-body problem”.A measurement for chronic pain is a scientific holy grail – and we’re getting closer | Abdul-Ghaaliq LalkhenRead moreEastern medicine and philosophy has long recognised the interconnectedness of body and mind, and so too did the west in early civilisations.In ancient Greece the Algea, the gods of physical pain, were also gods associated with psychic pain – with grief and distress. But in the 1600s the French philosopher René Descartes set western thinking on a different course, asserting that the mind and body were separate entities.“In a lot of countries we tend to want to downplay any possible psychological influences and we want to say it’s all physical,” says Nicholas, a director at the University of Sydney’s Pain Management Research Institute. Being told that pain has a psychological component can be distressing, particularly for those who experience chronic pain. It can feel dismissive, a suggestion that the pain is not real.“When people come to see me, they’re often worried they’re being told it’s all in their head,” Nicholas says.“Of course pain is in your head. It’s in your brain. You know, it’s the brain that is where you get that experience … It’s never all physical.”The true of people who tolerate acute pain. It’s never all physical. And it has little to do with heroism or freakishness.Sometime between 11am and 11.30am on 22 May 2024, as I sat at a big white conference table, before a screen of colleagues zooming into a meeting, a cyst on my right ovary exploded. I felt pain right away. With my right hand, I pressed hard into my lower stomach and breathed in and out slowly to ride through the feeling. Jesus, I thought. I shouldn’t have eaten so many Jols.I returned to my desk but still felt sore so went for a walk around the block to shake it off. I felt a little better, returned to my computer, popped in and out of smaller meetings, answered emails, edited articles, finished work at 5.30pm, then walked half an hour to my sister’s apartment and lay on her couch. While the pain was fairly strong I was still convinced an overconsumption of sugar-free sweets was responsible. Only when my sister called a helpline two hours later and a nurse told me to go to hospital did I relent. We arrived at emergency about 9pm, 10 hours after that first sharp twinge.Later in the night, as I climbed on to an examination bed, I froze. Pain sloshing around my abdomen violently halted my movement. As I stopped there silent, halfway to laying down, I saw the serious look on the doctor’s face.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

She was looking for other clues. (I would later learn that medical staff use self-reported pain as only one of a few measures to assess a patient, others include observations of movement, the ability to talk, facial expressions and guarding.)It was the middle of the night before an MRI returned the findings that I had spent the day with what the doctor called “a belly full of blood”. The next day I had surgery.At my bedside an obstetric surgeon shook his head as he explained what was going on in my body. A burst cyst has a reputation for being very painful, he said. Why had I rated my pain as a six or seven? Didn’t it make more sense to give it a 10? I shrugged. I’d wanted to give myself some wriggle room.So why was my experience and report of pain so out of whack with the tissue damage my body experienced?“It actually starts with our judgments,” says Associate Prof Melissa Day, from the University of Queensland. “So it’s not what happens to us. It’s how we judge what happens to us.”In other words, if we give ourselves a convincing explanation for what we feel, an explanation that does not include danger or damage to our body – if we think it’s the Jols and it will pass – we are less likely to feel pain severely.View image in fullscreenPain is a protective mechanism – injury or tissue damage activates the brain’s warning system that creates it.Illustration: Victoria Hart/Guardian designWe have a tendency to valorise those who do not complain of pain when they confront an acute injury. To say this is a tough person, a stoic person. But individual toughness or weakness is not what’s at play in pain responses, and the same person can have two entirely different reactions to pain-inducing events in different contexts.When Lorimer Moseley tried a heat pad pain test on himself, increasing the temperature on the pad on his hand and noting his rising pain levels, it took removing the pad from his skin to realise he had given himself two-and-a-half-degree burn. “This happens to people who do a lot of pain research because you just get exposed and your brain doesn’t think it’s worth protecting you as much as it should,” he says.“But I put my hand in hot water to do the dishes – I’m hopeless.”Just five years ago the International Association for the Study of Pain revised its definition of pain. The new definition follows what is called a bio-psychosocial model, which recognises not just the biological causes of pain but the role of psychology and social context in creating, amplifying – or dulling – it. While this is the contemporary thinking about pain, says Nicholas: “Most people don’t use it. Most clinicians, unfortunately, even.”The biological causes are clearest. Pain tolerance, researchers speaking to Guardian Australia say, has some genetic component. Red-haired people, for example, Moseley says, have on average a different threshold at which their nerves are triggered by a change in temperature in a heat-based pain threshold test.Complex social factors play a substantial role: multiple studies have found that people from a lower socioeconomic status experience both more chronic pain and, in experimental pain tests,demonstrate lower acute pain thresholds.For all people, injury or tissue damage activates the brain’s warning system that creates pain.The associated stress can trigger a psycho-biological response that helps the hurt person get through it without being immobilised.The best coping techniques will be different for different individualsMelissa Day“Short-term stress actually motivates us,” Day says. “Gets adrenaline pumping through our bodies, allows us to have natural endorphins to push through. There’s also endogenous opioids that our brain releases to have that short-term relief of pain.”The psychological elements are becoming more widely understood. “One thing we know is perhaps the strongest predictor of pain tolerance is how people think about pain,” Day says.“If we think ‘this is terrible, this is awful, it’s going to do me serious damage’ – those types of people will have lower tolerance.” This includes people who tend to be anxious or who catastrophise pain.Osher Günsberg: ‘The worst thing is being told the pain is all in your head. But holy moly, was it empowering!’Read moreThe perception of the damage being done can have a substantial role. A violinist is more likely to report higher levels of pain when a pain stimulus is applied to their dominant playing hand than when their other hand is subjected to the same stimulus, Moseley says – because an injury to their dominant hand could end their career. Farmers are known to delay seeking treatment , he adds. “It might be that farmers expect that a part of being a farmer is to have pain. So [their brain] doesn’t urge them to do anything about it. Their expectation is: you have pain.”Our past experience of pain also plays a substantial role. Should I have another cyst explode, Moseley suggests I might feel more pain – I will have learned that this sensation signals serious damage and should not be ignored.Research suggestsmen generally have higher pain thresholds than women. Pain fluctuates for women at periods of hormonal change. Moseley says differences in sensitivity in immune systems and response to hormones plays a part. But so does “the way that they’re related to from birth”.“Nature versus nurture – you can’t really separate them,” Day says. “There’s a range of factors there in terms of learning histories about pain and how from a young age responses to pain are very much linked to gender as well – how parents respond to a son versus a daughter.”As psychologists working in pain, Day and Nicholas are interested in what behaviours might help people in pain tolerate or reduce the amount of pain they are experiencing.“The best coping techniques will be different for different individuals and will be different across different contexts” Day says.People who think they have a higher pain threshold – we will never know. It’s the same human that makes the pain and that tolerates itLorimer MoseleyNevertheless, for acute pain suppression – “I’m not thinking about this because I’ve got this goal I need to achieve” – can work well in the short term, says Day. (“Longer term, it rebounds.”) Emotional regulation strategies, meditation and learning how to calm the body can be effective. Working on beliefs about the pain and shifting attention away from it, says Nicholas, fall under individual control. “If you can control those factors you will have a better response to pain,” Day says.An individual’s sensitivity to reward and punishment plays a role in acute pain thresholds too, Day says. People who are more sensitive to punishment tend more often to retract at the appearance of pain, whereas those more oriented towards rewards are more likely to push through it to achieve a goal, she says. Elite athletes are known to have higher pain thresholds as they are habituated to pain in their training regimes.Which is to say, if you are in a grand final and you think you’ve got a shot at winning, and you know the national team selectors are watching, your fixation on your goal might increase your ability to ignore the pain radiating from your jaw.Is that what made John Sattler play on? I will never know. He died in 2023. But we know he had all the predispositions for withstanding acute injury: he was habituated to pain as an athlete in a game famed for its big hits, he was reward-oriented in a moment when the stakes were high, he was a male socialised to value withstanding pain as a badge of toughness, and saw toughness valued as a social virtue. The clash would have got his endogenous opioids pumping. His attention was redirected away from his injury. Pain is a protective mechanism but, from all we know about that day,Sattler judged protecting his jaw as less important than claiming the premiership.“People who think they have a higher pain threshold – we will never know,” Moseley says. “It’s the same human that makes the pain and that tolerates it.”And so the experience of acute pain is caught in the realm of mystery and mythology; where we can understand much of what is happening in a body and part of what is happening in a brain but never actually know what another person feels.The legend of John Sattler goes that after that fateful right hook from Bucknall, the bloodied captain turned to his teammate Matthew Cleary. That no one knew, perhaps not even himself, the damage that had been done to him became his mythological power.“Hold me up,” he said. “So they don’t know I’m hurt.”Explore more on these topicsHealth (Australia news)Health (Society)Rugby leagueAustralia sportSouth Sydney RabbitohsMedical researchfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it’s not your responsibility to fix thingsEvery week Annalisa Barbieri addresses a problem sent in by a readerAnnalisa BarbieriSun 13 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Jul 2025 12.33 EDTShareI started high school last yearwith somefriendsI’ve known for a long time. One of those friends hasstarted to act toxicallywith other people.I have been distancing myself from her for a while, but nothing seems to work. She is really sensitive and has a history of dishonesty, which makes confronting her about my feelings incredibly difficult. She talks badly about many people, butpretends to them that they are the problem.I have already talked to teachers about this, but theytake her side, and I always get in trouble. I don’t know how to bring this up orget her to understandI don’t want to be her friend any more. What should I do?Starting high school is a big step and there’s lots of change, and whenever there’s change in a group there’s a jostling for position and a lot of insecurities come out. It’s also a big step because you go from being the oldest students in school to the youngest, and are exposed to far more adult behaviours. I wonder what’s going on with your friend, but it’s important to remember you are absolutely not responsible for her behaviour. So while it’s really good to think compassionately about what’s happening to others, ultimately they own their behaviour and you own yours. It’s never too early to learn this.I went to Alison Roy, who is a child and adolescent psychotherapist. She said the fact you had noticed something had changed for your friend, while also being aware of your feelings showed real maturity.Sometimes when people change it’s an opportunity for us to try out new friendships and move outside our comfort zonesIt’s frustrating that the teachers don’t seem to hear what you say, but teachers, while doing a great job, aren’t always the best people to help you deal with the psychology of friendships. Also, as Roy pointed out, “teachers don’t always have the time or bandwidth for friendship dynamics and would expect you to try to resolve things independently”. It can be very different from how things are managed in primary school.Roy also explained that when people (young or old) feel insecure “they can start to behave differently. There may well be something else going on for your friend that you won’t know about, and they might not want to tell you. You could ask a few gentle questions, although it isn’t your responsibility to fix things. What you do have control over is how you deal with your own feelings and concerns; and sometimes when people change and we find we have less in common with them, it’s an opportunity to try out new friendships and move outside our comfort zones a bit.”The defensiveness and dishonesty your friend displays could be due to shame, and the reasons people can be like that are complex. But again, that’s not for you to fix.Learning to put in boundaries, but also thinking about what might be going on for others (with the caveats we’ve mentioned), are really important life skills. So is being able to communicate with people you used to get on with but now find challenging. Most friendships will rupture at some point, the real skill is in the repair. Lots of adults struggle with this.You say you don’t want to be her friend any more, but you are also asking for help. Sometimes the simplest solution is right there, but we don’t take it. Here, that would be asking your friend, in a quiet moment, something like: “I don’t feel we get on as well as we did. I wonder how it feels for you?” And taking it from there. You can’t do all the work for her, but this would be an incredibly mature thing to do. I always think face to face is best, because you can get a “360” view on that person – ie, not just what they say on text, but what clues are in their body language.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I’ve been married four times and only ever did things in “the normal way” – the missionary position. That had pretty much been my sex life for the past 50 years. The last five years of my most recent marriage we had sex once. My ex would take care of himself and sex wasn’t high on my priority list. I had spent my life thinking it was more about male pleasure.So until I met Brian two years ago, I had not had a wide variety of sexual experiences. I didn’t know there were new things out there, so didn’t know what to look for. And I’d never looked for relationships outside my marriages because commitment and monogamy are very important to me.Being with Brian has been an eye-opening experience – a very good one. I’ve discovered sex can be enjoyable, which has been a wonderful realisation. There are no mandates and we are very good at communicating. We’re not afraid of saying things like, “that’s not the spot, go lower”. Fifty years of being sexually active and I’d never had that in a relationship. It has been life-changing.If there’s anything new he wants to try he’ll ask me to think about it. I normally have questions – because I haven’t done it beforeThe intimacy between us is not just missionary. Before Brian, I hadn’t tried role-playing. The first time, I didn’t really know what to do, but he was patient and walked me through it. From his reactions, I could tell what he responded to so I got more confident in what I was doing.If there’s anything new he wants to try, he’ll ask me to think about it. I normally have questions – because I haven’t done it before – and we’ll talk about it. We come to a resolution and decide if we’re going to try it or not.For me, intimacy is really important. It’s the emotions and feelings you get from the sexual encounter. Just touching my cheek with his hand or nibbling my neck. We’ll have dinner, watch a movie, play a game. I never want to feel as if I’m rushed into sex or it’s got to be done right now. I’m not one to just take my clothes off and jump in bed. I like to take my time with it.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

We were both divorced, and I had previously been married for 40 years. Since retiring and being separated, the sexual part of my life had a chance to develop, because I no longer had a super-demanding job or anything like that. It gave me more freedom to pursue other things, including who I was sexually.I’m an outgoing and friendly person, so I was looking for everything in this new relationship – a physical relationship, but also all the other normal things, to have fun with someone, to cook for them. Elaine and I are both people who really enjoy and value sexual activity. We also found we could have open communication about sex – and, probably because of our age, we’re more concerned about making the most of our time together.She had had more traditional sex … I started to let her know there were additional things that we could mess around withWhereas she had had more traditional sex throughout her life, I started to let her know there were some additional things we could try. I like to do a little bit of role-playing. Sometimes I’m her rumpled gardener who comes to take care of her house and gives her a little throw around the bed. I also find dressing a little femininely turns up my sexual excitement. Elaine is a very accepting and loving person. She’s been open to all of this stuff and we have very honest conversations.We always figure out a way to make things work and to satisfy each other, regardless of the situation, as I know my body’s ageing and so is hers. That mainly just means things have calmed down a little. We probably have sex about once a week now. We’ll get together, have dinner, maybe watch a little TV. She likes wine and I like a cocktail (I make a good strawberry margarita). I’ll put some music on, we’ll sit on the couch and start making out, then we end up in the sack.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThis is how we do itSexRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sooner or later, something will have to giveSun 13 Jul 2025 07.51 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Jul 2025 14.23 EDTShareIt was a hot day in July, but the headlines felt as if they could have come from any day over the last six months. While the dependably shrill TV channel GB Newsasked its viewerswhether negotiations with France “could signal a shift towards closer ties with the EU”, Keir Starmer and his colleagues were in final talks about so-called small boats. Before he got to the diplomatic details, the BBC’s Nick Robinson boiled down the views of millions of Britons to the deathless cliche: “Why don’t we just send them back to where they’ve come from?”Kemi Badenoch was about tomake a speechabout restricting non-British nationals’ access to disability and sickness benefits – another instalment, it seemed, of her toxic quest to divide people into“makers” and “takers”. Terrifyingly, Nigel Farage’s Reform UK colleagueswere talkingabout focusing their belief in Elon Musk-style budget-cutting on children with disabilities. In the searing heat, everything felt as if it was fusing together to form the usual picture – of a stroppy little island, full of mistrust and loathing, and an angry chunk of the electorate now so huge that politicians of all parties must not just respect its collective wishes, but implement them in full.Ten days earlier – and bear with me here – I had spent three days in a rather different political atmosphere, among the multitudes at Glastonbury. Even before all that controversy had erupted over the Irish rappers Kneecap and the hitherto-obscure duo Bob Vylan, the buildup to the festival had already seen a burst of hostile commentary about Glastonbury’s political side. “Could we please drop the nonsense that it is countercultural, at the bleeding edge of interesting, against-the-grain, perhaps even revolutionary, sentiment?” asked one rathersilly piecein the Telegraph. To which the correct and rather complicated response would be yes; with notable exceptions – from the ubiquity of Palestinian flags, through the debates and discussions in the festival’s Left Field, to everything that happens in the area called Green Futures. But here’s the thing: even if you largely accept that Glasto has long become an ordinary part of the cultural mainstream, that’s actually what makes it so interesting.How does the right tear down progressive societies? It starts with a joke | George MonbiotRead moreWe are long past the point where the crowds there represent an avowedly radical subculture, which was the thrilling sense I got when I first went there (in 1990, which was a very long time ago indeed). Now, the people who go – from hard-partying twentysomethings barely cognisant of the need for a tent, to festival veterans in sensible outdoor gear who carefully plan each day’s bands and go home to jobs in the public sector – are a microcosm of a vast and ever-growing part of the UK population, which is why so many people try to get tickets, and so many thousands watch it on TV. We are talking, essentially, about the Britain – or, more specifically, England – that will never, ever belong to Farage, and the mixture of kindness, ease with modernity and fuzzy liberalism that defines it.There is a kind of progressive cringe that gets in the way of acknowledging this fact. But while the media class focuses almost exclusively on a bundle of cliches about “hero voters” in “red wall” seats, this new England now sits at the heart of our politics. It explains why the Conservative presence in the commuter-belt home counties isshrinking fast, and the list of seats represented by the Lib Dems includes scores of traditional Tory heartlands – something Badenoch does not seem even dimly aware of. For Labour, millions of liberal, left-ish voters define a story of rising dismay about Starmer’s government, and the fact that it islosing more supportto the Lib Dems and Greens than it is to Reform UK. The Green party now has MPs in rural Herefordshire and rural East Anglia, andrecord-breakingnumbers of councillors.Much as opinion polling remains a somewhat dismal and unreliable science, there are plenty of issue-specific statistics that paint the same picture. Even if they are presented as a way of somehow getting people into work, 40% of usare against new limitationson disability benefits. Despite politicians’ reluctance to say so,45% of British adultsthink Israel’s actions in Gaza are genocidal. Forty-nine percent of people “strongly support” a wealth tax. Contrary to the idea that everyone outside London, Manchester and Bristol has an essentially Farage-ist view of human movement,45% of usthink that immigration into the UK should either increase or stay the same. Sixty-one percent of people eitherstrongly or “somewhat”support the government’s net zero target, with only 12% ticking the “strongly oppose” box.Despite Reform UK’s apparent monopoly on explanations for our fragmenting party system, all this is central to why everything is in such a massive state of flux. The Lib Dems are nowalmost neck and neckwith the Tories in the polls. The Greens are now steady, on about 10% – a figure that would surely rocket upwards if they improved their dire PR skills. Moreover, adding these parties’ share of support with Labour’s usually gets you close to 50%, which only highlights how misplaced the popular idea of a seethingly reactionary country irrevocably on the path to a Reform UK government really is.As orthodox politics buckles and fragments, it feels as if, sooner or later, something will have to give. The latest manifestation of the strain Westminster orthodoxy is under is the new leftwing force beingfitfully formedby Jeremy Corbyn and the former Labour MP, Zarah Sultana; but I am not sure it will quite meet the moment. If we were in some alternative universe where our party system mapped on to people’s views, a modern party of the liberal left would not be hard to envisage. Its style of politics might fall somewhere between Ed Davey and the former Green leader Caroline Lucas.Though it might not be radical enough for some people’s tastes (mine included, possibly) it would speak clearly about the climate emergency, be proudly and loudly European and be carefully redistributionist. Crucially, it would spurn the politics of resentment and scapegoating, and confidently fight Farage – and, for that matter, Reform-ish Tories such as Robert Jenrick – on territoryLabourrefuses to go near: the modern right’s views about the UK and its history, who is and isn’t British, and all the rest.This would, perhaps, be the kind of party many people – not least in the Guardian – are always willing the Labour party to become, even though that never seems to happen. As much as any political force could, it would speak for millions who now see the political centre being dragged further and further away from them, and quietly recoil. I see this new England every year at Worthy Farm in Somerset. Most importantly, it reveals itself whenever I visit the relevant swaths of the country.

Nato must step upSun 13 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Jul 2025 14.18 EDTShareFor 40 cruel and bloody months, Ukraine has fought the Russian invader. Since February 2022, when Moscow’s full-scale, countrywide onslaught began, its people have faced relentless, devastating attacks. Tens of thousands have beenkilled or wounded, millions have lost their homes. Ukraine’s industries, shops, schools, hospitals and power stations burn, its fertile farmlands arelaid waste. Its children are orphaned, traumatised or abducted. Despite repeated appeals, the world has failed to stop the carnage. And yet Ukraine, outnumbered and outgunned, has continued to fight back.Ukrainian heroism amid horror has become so familiar, it’s almost taken for granted. But as Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin,escalates the war, raining nightly terror on Kyiv and other cities usingrecord waves of armed drones, as US support and peace efforts falter, and as Ukraine’s overstretched frontline soldiers face exhaustion, such complacency looks increasingly misplaced. A no longer hypothetical question becomes ever more real and urgent: what if Ukraine falls?Answer: Ukraine’s collapse, if it happens, would amount to an epicwestern strategic failurematching or exceeding the Afghanistan and Iraq calamities. The negative ramifications for Europe, Britain, the transatlantic alliance and international law are truly daunting. That thought alone should concentrate minds.It has been evident since the dying days of 2023, when its counteroffensive stalled, that Ukraine is not winning. For most of this year, Russian forces have inexorablyinched forward in Donetskand other eastern killing grounds, regardless of cost. Estimated Russian casualties recentlysurpassed 1 million, dead and wounded. Still they keep coming. While there has been no big Russian breakthrough, for Ukraine’s pinned-down, under-supplied defenders the war is now a daily existential struggle. That they manage to keep going at all is astonishing.How much longer Ukraine can hold the line, on the battlefield, in the skies, and diplomatically and politically, is in serious doubt. It is short of manpower, ammunition and interceptor missiles. It can still strike back hard. Itsoccupation of Russia’s Kurskregion, and last month’sdestruction of strategic bombersbased deep inside Russia, were remarkable. But such temporary successes do not alter the basic imbalance of power or general direction of travel.Increasingly, too, Ukraine is short of reliable friends, though maybe that has always been the case. Putin has assembled his own “coalition of the willing” – China, Iran,North Koreaand others – to support his war machine. The west’s equivalent, led by Britain and France, is in limbo. Deployment of a military “reassurance force” cannot proceed. Due to Putin’s intransigence and Donald Trump’s incompetence, there is no ceasefire to uphold and none in prospect.Speaking in London last week, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, and Britain’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, regurgitatedfamiliar pledgesof unflinching support. That’s easy. Effective military assistance is harder. Like other European countries, the UK and France lack the advanced weapons and materiel, in the quantities required, that only the US can supply.Attempting to fill the gap, Friedrich Merz, Germany’s chancellor, proposes to buy US Patriot batteries andgift themto Kyiv. Yet like the EU as a whole and last month’s Nato summiteers, Merz’s priority is national self-defence. As he measures out missiles for Ukraine, he’s trebling Germany’s defence spending. The UK is doing much the same.Trump, the US’s surrender monkey, remains Kyiv’s biggest diplomatic headache. His lopsided 30-day ceasefire plan wasrejected by Moscow, his proffered US-Russia commercial deals spurned. After months of slandering Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and sucking up to Putin, the “very stable genius” has concluded the Russian leader, an indicted war criminal,talks “bullshit”and cannot be trusted. Well, fancy that.Trump now says he will resume limited supplies of defensive weapons to Kyiv and may back additional sanctions. But this is not about policy or principle. His ego is damaged. Hisfeelings are hurt. One flattering word from his smirking Kremlin bro could turn him around in a flash. Like all bullies, Trump instinctively favours the stronger party. Little wonder Putin calculates he can wear down Ukraine, outlast the west and win the war.Ukraine war briefing: Trump poised to send weapons under Biden-style drawdown, say sourcesRead moreAll is not lost. With or without Trump, Nato could take a tougher line, as repeatedly urged here, by imposing air exclusion zones over unoccupied Ukraine and targeting incoming missiles and drones. The military position is clearcut, the legal and humanitarian case is unassailable. Russia frequently infringes the sovereignty of Nato neighbours. Putin’s attempts at nuclear blackmail, which sounnerved Joe Biden, are contemptible. If it only had the balls, Nato could put him back in his box.Failing that, new US and EU sanctions targeting Russian oil exports should be imposed without further delay. Billions of Kremlin dollars held by western banks should be expropriated to pay for arms and reconstruction. Fence-straddlers such as India thatrefuse to sanctionthe Kremlin and profit from the war should be invited to read the European court of human rights’shocking new reporton Russian war crimes savagery – and told to pick a side.Two outcomes now seem most probable: a stalemated forever war, orUkraine’s collapse. Defeat for Ukraine and a settlement on Putin’s hegemonic terms would be a defeat for the west as a whole – a strategic failure presaging an era of permanent, widening conflict across all of Europe. For Russians, too, neither outcome would constitute lasting victory. Greater efforts are needed to convince Russia’s politicians and public that this war, so costly for their country in lives and treasure, can be ended through negotiation, that legitimate security concerns will be addressed, that the alternatives are far worse.But first, they must give him up. The chief architect of this horror, the principal author of Russia’s disgrace, must be defanged, deposed and delivered to international justice. Putin, notUkraine, must fall.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionRussiaVladimir PutinEuropeDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Let’s have some long-term thinking insteadSun 13 Jul 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Jul 2025 12.58 EDTShareIt’s way too hot. I’m cowering inside, curtains drawn, pale limbs clammily exposed, the sound of my overheated laptop fan drowning out the sound of an ancient, feeble desk fan. If it gets any hotter, I’ll stagger to my air-conditioned car and drive to the air-conditioned supermarket to stand in its chilly aisles, shamelessly fanning myself over the ravaged ice-cream cabinet in the freezer aisle. I’ve even become nostalgic for the summer when I shared an office with a man who insisted on having the AC set to 17C, meaning I had to wear a cardigan to work in August.Ah, air conditioning, the dream. Or the nightmare? Welcome to appliance culture wars, 2025 edition. You may recall, in 2023, the US debated whetherinduction hobswere a communist plot; then last year Republicans tried, in all apparent seriousness, to pass theLiberty in LaundryandRefrigerator Freedomacts. This year has already featured Donald Trump pledging to “make America’s showers great again” (low water pressure means it takes 15 minutes to wet his “beautiful hair”) and now France is grappling withMarine Le Pen declaring herself its AC champion.As the country suffered through an early summer heatwave, with temperatures reaching the 40s, schools closing and, according tomodelling, an estimated 235 deaths, Le Pen pledged, if elected, to launch a “grand plan” to cool France. Her ally, Éric Ciotti, called for AC to be obligatory in schools, hospitals and care homes to “protect the most vulnerable”.With even higher temperatures predicted, this might prove a popular promise. It would certainly please the many Americans holidaying in Europe,expressing their sweaty astonishmentat how we manage here without the chilly kiss of refrigerant-gas-cooled air. But the French AC debate rapidly heated up: Le Pen facedscathing criticismfrom the Greens and ecological transition minister Agnès Pannier-Runacher, who noted Le Pen’s party voted against plans to develop more sustainable “cooling networks”. The environment agency president called AC “an alibi for inaction”. Accused of hypocrisy by right-wing commentators afterreporting on environmental concerns around AC, Libération even published afollow-upconfirming its offices werenotair conditioned (though conceding a few “air coolers” had taken the temperature down to 32C – ugh – in the hottest spots).I was a big orca fan – but their skincare regime is giving me the ick | Emma BeddingtonRead moreBecause climate control is a climate problem. In the US, where AC is ubiquitous and its necessity not up for debate, theDepartment of Energysays it accounts for about 12% of energy consumption in homes and “contributes significantly to carbon dioxide emissions, releasing over 100m metric tons annually”. In 2019, theInternational Energy Authority predictedthat, as the rest of the world catches up, AC will produce 2bn tonnes of CO2annually. Relying on it to cope with an ever-hotter planet contributes to global heating, making us need it more. That’s not a solution; in Pannier-Runacher’s words, it’s a “maladaptive” coping mechanism.AC is quantifiably bad, but I think it’s also philosophically problematic. Cooling offers comfort, making the unbearable bearable, at least for now. That happens at a community level (no one is really disputing we should keep the very old, the very young and the vulnerable cool), but also individually. When you can buy a personal bubble of coolness and not truly feel the heat, the screaming urgency to tackle the collective issue of a world on fire can recede slightly.And this is where I have to fess up. I actually have AC – a little freestanding unit we use only in the evenings, maybe 10 times a year. We also have solar panels and a battery, which helps me sleep at night, but the cool helps more. If the government came for my AC, I wouldn’t demand they “pry it out of my cold, dead hands”, asone Republicansaid of his gas stove, but at times like these, I’m deeply, guiltily glad of it.Air conditioning isn’t the answer. We need more ambitious plans but, without them, many more people – not just rampant individualists, climate deniers, laundry liberators and fridge freedom fighters, but hot furtive hypocrites like me and anyone desperate to get some sleep – will be tempted by the easy, cool, breezy solution.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionHomescommentShareReuse this content"

Canvas bags were festooned with the lightning font of AC/DC and Led Zeppelin, lined up outside classrooms as far as the eye could see. And then there was my bag, with “Life is God” in big bubble writing along the flap, the smell of the permanent marker filling my head with the feeling of floating heavenwards on the wings of truth.I was prepared to be scorned, spat upon, ridiculed. There was nothing I wanted more than to be persecuted, like the early Christians, in order to prove my devotion to God.Devotion has its roots in the Latindevovere,to vow. It goes beyond love, implying an active, passionate desire to prove one’s love. Swifties know what I mean.In a culture obsessed with positive thinking, can letting go be a radical act? | Nadine LevyRead moreDevotional practices extend back hundreds of years before pop stars began cashing in the human inclination to revere. Thirteenth-century Christian flagellants would whip each other to atone for sins and share in the suffering of Christ, their saviour.Devotion can be a jealous kind of love. According to the Jewish Torah, Abraham was prepared to kill his own son Isaac when Y-w-h asked him to, stopping before the blade nicked Isaac’s skin only when Y-w-h spoke from the heavens and told him he had passed the test of love. Devotion to Christ, Allah, Shiva, Vishnu and a range of other gods has long been manipulated by powerful elites to motivate sectarian violence.But devotional practices do not have to be violent. Well known for its pantheon of divinities, Hinduism offersbhakti,the way of devotion, as one of the possible paths tomoksha– liberation from the cycle of reincarnation. Popularbhaktisects follow Vishnu or Shiva and their various avatars, and followers engage in devotional practices such as yoga, self-purification, chanting and temple worship. A devotee expresses and develops her connection to her chosen avatar in the role of mother, father, brother, sister, daughter, lover.Devotional practices are still core to world religions (and modern fan culture) because of, to quote Céline Dion, the “power of love”. Devotion brings together human emotion, story and intent, weaving ever stronger ties to group and godhead. Without devotion, religion becomes a dry intellectual exercise, inadequate to motivate people to acts of heroism or sacrifice. Hinduism has a tradition ofjnana,a path tomokshavia philosophical study and contemplation. But, as my 13-year-old self intuitively knew, it’s hard to develop spiritual fervour for a philosophical construct. “Life is Hope in the Face of the Impossibility of Knowing For Sure if the Universe Has Purpose” just doesn’t fit on a backpack.Even some schools of Buddhism, a famously non-materialist tradition, allow followers to cultivate devotion to figures such as Kuan Yin, a bodhisattva of compassion. Islamic Sufi poets such as Rumi, and Christian saints such as Gertrude the Great, or Teresa of Ávila, wrote devotional works about God as their divine lover. The Tao Te Ching makes no mention of a godhead, but that hasn’t stopped religious Taoists from deifying Lao Tzu, the text’s author.On balance, I would have to say that religious devotional practices to a specific godhead are no longer for me. In the years since I let my backpack speak on my behalf, I have left behind institutional religions. I dislike the idea that there is a “being”, no matter how metaphorical, to whom I owe allegiance. I still bow to the awesomeness of nature and cosmic mystery. But ducking my head to a god feels, well, blasphemous.I no longer wish I was an early Christian like Saint Peter, asking to be crucified upside down, because I wasn’t good enough to die the way Jesus did. As a non-religious pastoral care practitioner, I sit with my co-workers for 10 minutes or so at the start of each day. We share a quiet, contemplative space, preparing ourselves to be present. Some of my co-workers are Christian; sometimes, they pray. I listen, part of me wishing I could feel what they feel. When they finish, I whisper along with them, “Amen.”Jackie Bailey is the author of The Eulogy, the winner of the 2023 NSW Premier’s literary multicultural award.

That doesn’t mean I want them banished from my lifeRachel ConnollyAs Britain’s birthrate falls, hostility towards children in public spaces seems to be rising. That’s sad for all of usSun 13 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Jul 2025 14.15 EDTShareIt struck me recently that, as a woman in my 30s, I am almost never asked about my plans to have children. Even in the few instances I have been, the question arose naturally in a related conversation and each time, when I said “Oh I don’t think I want children”, the other person responded politely and didn’t push any agenda.We could draw conclusions on what this says about other people’s impressions of my lifestyle or my mothering instincts. But let’s choose to see this anecdote in a positive light. I imagine that, even as recently as 10 years ago, I would have had to endure endless hectoring and intrusive comments about the so-called “biological clock”. Or about ending up lonely in my old age or having a life which feels somehow empty or unfulfilled, as if that never happens to people with children.I think I don’t really get asked this because now fewer of us are having children. Last year, the fertility rate in England and Wales (which measures how many children are born per woman during her childbearing years) wasthe lowest on record, at 1.44 children. The number of babies born was also the lowest it has been since the 1970s. Figures like this are usually bandied about as a source of doom and gloom regarding the state of the world. People are not having children only because they can’t afford to, we are told, or because they fear impending environmental collapse.No doubt this is true for some people. But this focus may eclipse another, more straightforward reason: more of us are realising that if we don’t want children we simply don’t have to have them. In the space of a few generations many (although not all) of the restrictions placed on women’s lives, in particular, have been dropped. It is commonplace for women to go to university and pursue the career of their choosing. The pressure to have a family has lessened. And I think the relief of that pressure is worth celebrating. (After all, in our time of environmental and social collapse we must take our silver linings where we can find them!)Still, I have wondered recently if one negative corollary to these changing norms is a pervasive and growing anti-child sentiment. I notice it everywhere. There is constant social media discourse about the annoyance of having to interact with children in pubs or cafes or parks. Now we’re into school holidays I can detect the grumbling ramping up. There are noticeably more children in my local pub as some of the regular patrons have started families. It often feels as if a war is brewing, with locals of all ages hissing and whispering, their eyes narrowed if families leave 15 minutes later than the child curfew.Occasionally there is bad behaviour from the parents too. Recently a few dads brought a group of eight or so children of various ages to spend a sunny day inside watching a football match they were clearly not interested in. Naturally they all charged around the pub like horses in a western, barging into people and knocking over glasses. But I think we can accept there will be bad examples of every demographic and that this group would have had a great time at the park.It isn’t just that one pub. There wasa story recently about more pub landlords, facing a tough climate in the midst of the cost of living crisis, choosing to ban young children from pubs to manage this tension. I empathise with the difficult position they feel they have been put in. But to me it feels like a choice they shouldn’t have to make. Quite often now, too, when I’m in restaurants or cafes, if a parent enters with a child or a pram, people start tutting and muttering, or rolling their eyes. God forbid if the baby starts to cry, as babies do. It strikes me as very rude and also counterproductive. If you greet an adult in a hostile way you won’t get the best out of them. Why would it be different for a child?Even as someone not primarily affected by all this tutting and muttering I find it tiresome. It feels melodramatic, joyless and, dare I say, also quite childish. Consider too that, in general, women still do the bulk of childcare. What do we expect them to do? Sit in the house all day wearing black, pushing their babies back and forth in one of those metal Victorian prams with the big spokes, so the rest of us needn’t be troubled by their existence? Is it really such a big deal to hear a baby briefly cry in the afternoon in a pub? If that is the price to pay for their mum being out and about in the world I think it’s a more than fair one.It feels strange, to me, to draw us all into two camps of “has children” or “doesn’t have children”. Those labels cover such a vast array of different lifestyles and choices, as well as circumstances which are sadly forced, rather than chosen. But whether or not we end up having children, it serves us well to consider how we welcome families of young children into our public spaces. After all, few of us end up living a life completely “free” of children. My own isn’t. As I come into my 30s the women around me are having children. I already have two godchildren. I have a feeling I might end up with 10 or so. And if I’m ever rich, maybe I will hire them all a holiday villa when they turn 18 and they can bond over the honour of having me for a godparent. I imagine I’ll end up with nieces and nephews too. Or stepchildren. Who knows? Time brings all kinds of different, unexpected relationships into our lives.The children I see about in the cafes or pubs in my neighbourhood are a part of the community like anyone else. The idea of public spaces cleanly absent of children seems to speak to a fantasy of a world where the lives we live are totally detached from the lives of the people around us. But of course they aren’t. And if this fantasy were reality, our lives would be very small and boring.Rachel Connolly is the author of the novel Lazy CityExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionFamilyChildrencommentShareReuse this content"

But they marked the beginning of a new era that calls for actionSun 13 Jul 2025 07.00 EDTShareFive years ago, the entire world changed when we saw George Floyd’s body on the pavement, a knee pressed into his neck – a murder, in broad daylight. Others might have simply witnessed a horrific incident, but Black people saw ourselves, and what it’s like to live with a knee on our necks at all times. Because George Floyd wasn’t the first – and unless we uproot this system, he won’t be the last. The police have gone so far as to remind us of this by killingmore people each yearsince George Floyd.But the uprisings of 2020 didn’t erupt because of one killing. They were the breaking point of centuries of violence and neglect. Trayvon Martin. Freddie Gray. Sandra Bland. Oscar Grant. Breonna Taylor. Dreasjon Reed. Ma’Khia Bryant. Ahmaud Arbery. And far too many others whose names never trended. The message was clear: we’ve had enough.Diversity statements flooded inboxes. DEI initiatives exploded. The country saw its first woman of color as vice-president. We even saw Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leaders make symbolic gestures, such as kneeling in kente cloth. It seemed like maybe, just maybe, we were being heard.Zohran Mamdani won by being himself – and his victory has revealed the Islamophobic ugliness of others | Nesrine MalikRead moreBut in hindsight, those gestures weren’t signs of transformation – they were proof that we weren’t being heard at all.We weren’t asking for slogans painted on the streets, Pepsi commercials, or Black and brown faces in high places. We were demanding something much deeper: a total transformation of our economy, our politics and our communities. We were demanding the right to live long, healthy lives without the constant threat of poverty, policing, racism or abandonment.Instead, we got aBiden administration, elected in large part because of the largest protest in American history for racial justice, telling us: “Nothing will fundamentally change.”The so-called allies may have ignored us. But our demands were not ignored by everyone.The oligarchs – and Trump’s new regime – didn’t ignore us. They heard us loud and clear and prepared for war. Their greatest fear was that our uprisings might become a revolution. And that fear has shaped their response ever since. That’s how we entered this new era of authoritarianism and counterinsurgency, on a road paved by Democratic administrations that sought to suppress and co-opt the very movements that put them in power.Police are killing with impunity.2024 was the deadliest year for police violencein more than a decade: 1,375 lives taken. In spite of liberal efforts to make police more accountable with oversight boards, consent decrees and “community policing”, the police have seen their budgets increase by billions of dollars nationally.While we demanded better wages, affordable housing, divestment from fossil fuels, and community-based solutions rooted in healing and care, elected officials, even in some of the nation’s most “progressive” cities, answered with punishment and surveillance. In 2024, when young people wanted theircolleges to divest from war and genocide,they were met with brutalityand police repression.We wanted peace, and we were met with violence. They continue to meet us with tear gas, armored vehicles and curfews. They are banning books, censoring classrooms and undermining democracy at every turn.Now, in the streets of Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Chicago and all across the country, people are rising up to resist Ice. The people are back outside, losing their fear of standing up to a self-fashioned oligarchic dictator.Made in AmericaSome say Trump is borrowing from the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini’s authoritarian playbook. But the truth is, these tactics weren’t borrowed – they were made in America. The United States has long perfected the machinery of repression, exporting it abroad and inspiring apartheid regimes and fascist movements across the globe.We are not witnessing the arrival of fascism. We are watching it evolve and expand.What’s changing now is the scale – and the widening net of American fascism. The technologies and tactics once used to crush resistance in marginalized communities are being expanded and deployed against anyone who dares to dissent – even white liberals and poor and working-class white communities who once believed Trump would shake the system in their favor.We are not witnessing the arrival of fascism. We are watching it evolve and expand.And let’s be clear: this authoritarian turn didn’t begin with Trump. It was built – brick by brick – in Democratic strongholds.Our home state of California helped lay the foundation with its prison boom and decades of “tough on crime” policies, ranging from the Step Act of 1988 to “counteract gang violence” to the Los Angeles police department’s Operation Hammer, which devastated Black communities. Even Obama’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing – a so-called reform initiative – helped entrench modern policing by giving it a friendlier, and in many cases deadlier, face.While Trump didn’t create this system, he is accelerating it – weaponizing the bipartisan machinery of policing, surveillance and incarceration into one of the most militarized domestic regimes we’ve ever seen.Just look at what’s inthe federal budget:$46.5bn to build border walls through cities and ecosystems$45bn for immigrant detention– enough to quadruple Ice’s capacity$15bn for mass deportations, even of unaccompanied children$16.2bn to hirethousands of new Ice and border patrol agents$12bn to reimburse states such as Texas for violent anti-immigrant programs likeOperation Lone StarThat’s more than $130bn for locking people up, tearing families apart and building walls. That kind of money could cancel student debt. End homelessness. Fully fund universal childcare. But that’s not where their priorities lie.Because this was never about public safety – it’s about control.And now, with Trump promising to eliminate consent decrees – those rare federal checks on violent police departments like Minneapolis’s – it’s clear what direction they’re headed: more fear, fewer rights, less oversight and more power in the hands of the few.But, after the largest protest movement in modern American history, how can so much money go towards punishment? What happened from 2020 to now?Some say it was effective counter-organizing. Others suggest that it was the backlash against racial justice movements gaining ground. Here, it’s also important to assert another part of the story, animated by liberals and exploited by conservatives: copaganda.The machinery of misinformationThe state doesn’t just expand power through budgets – it does it through stories.In the bookCopaganda: How Police and the Media Manipulate Our News, we’re reminded that police departments aren’t just enforcers; they’re storytellers. They spend millions shaping public narratives: crime is everywhere, cops are heroes, the system is broken but fixable.Grassroots organizers are scraping together funds for one communications hire, if that. Police departments, on the other hand, run full-blown media operations.The New York City police department spent more than $4.5m in 2023 on its public information office alone, with staff dedicated to managing press, cutting footage and shaping public opinion. The LAPD has its own media relations division with more than 25 PR officers. Ice and Customs and Border Protection pay multimillion-dollar firms to launder their image.These agencies aren’t waiting for a crisis. They’re controlling the narrative before it even happens.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Too often, they act as stenographers. Repeating police press releases. Airing body-cam footage edited by the departments themselves. That’s not journalism. It’s marketing.Copaganda is how initiatives such as Proposition 36 passed in California, when liberal media played right into the hands of the powerful, manipulating votes for a “smash and grab” crime wave that is overblown. The Yes on Prop 36 coalition spent a combined $16m on ads and organizing to get Californians to undo decades of progressive criminal justice reform.We lost progressive district attorneys. Police budgets continued to grow. And somehow, even with all of this, our streets are no safer because of it. Because we know that the punishment bureaucracy does not keep us safe.But we saw something else, too.In the middle of collapse, when the system failed us here in Los Angeles through the climate catastrophe of the fires, and five years before that with Covid, it wasn’t the police who kept us safe. It was us. Regular, everyday people.We showed up. We cooked for each other. We ran mutual aid. We protected elders. We de-escalated conflict. We passed out masks and sanitizer. We built safety while the state built walls. That wasn’t just survival. It was vision.Some of that vision is still being built.We don’t just need better laws; we need a different foundation. One rooted in care, not cages. In justice that heals, not just punishesIn Oakland, the local community justice group CURYJ launched the Youth Power Zone, a community-designed hub offering workforce development, healing spaces, and leadership for formerly incarcerated and system-impacted youth. It’s what public safety looks like when it’s rooted in love, not punishment.In Los Angeles, grassroots formations such as CAT 911 (Community Alternatives to 911) were leading trainings on how to de-escalate conflict, treat bullet wounds, administer aid to people overdosing and keep our neighbors safe.Across California, the Crises Act is funding community-based emergency responders who show up for people in mental health crises, without a badge or a gun. It’s a life-saving alternative to 911, and proof that we don’t need armed police to keep people safe.These aren’t theories. They’re happening. And they deserve full public funding – not just pilot grants, but sustained resources that match the scale of the need.George Floyd left his house on 25 May expecting to come home. Breonna Taylor was going to wake up the next morning beside her beloved partner. Whenthe SEIU leader David Huerta was abducted by Iceduring the LA immigration raids on 6 June, he was fully expecting to go home that evening. Mahmoud Khalil was expecting to be there for the birth of his son. The system made sure they didn’t. That wasn’t just a tragedy. It was a reflection of what this country is designed to do to Black people. To poor people. To immigrants. To anyone deemed disposable, or a threat to the established order. Everyone is disposable under imperialism.This current administrationdoes not care if you are a poor immigrant who wants to find work, a first responder, a father just trying to get by, an Ivy League graduate student or a labor leader for one of the largest unions in the country. If you are in the way of the order of things, you are a problem, a threat, a target. They go out of their way to remind us that we are less than human. All of us.We don’t just need better laws; we need a different foundation. One rooted in care, not cages. In justice that heals, not just punishes. Because justice without care is just control by another name.A revolution or just a rebellion?The uprisings of 2020 were a rebellion. The question now is: will we do the revolutionary work?Organizing is so important in this moment. We’ve seen everyday people stand up to Ice and prevent deportations. We’ve seen students demand accountability from their institutions. We’ve seen school teachers defend their students, unions go on strike and abolitionist organizers building wherever they are.The powers that be are afraid, and they should be. This means we have to fight. It means we have to go outside. It means we must resist them. They can’t kill a resistance. You can’t kill an idea.That means not just resisting state violence but taking responsibility for building the world we actually want. It means feeding people. Holding space for healing. Creating alternatives to policing. Protecting trans kids. Fighting fascism in our schools and streets. And refusing to let our elected officials trade our lives for talking points.We have to organize. Fund community safety. Back mutual aid. Tell better stories.And keep fighting like our lives depend on it – because they do.2020 wasn’t the end. It wasn’t just a flashpoint. It was the beginning of a new era. The messy birth of the world we want to create, and the death of the current one.What’s giving us hope nowThe people haven’t stopped fighting. Whether it’s students standing up to police repression, neighbors running mutual aid, community members defending immigrants against Ice or organizers building community safety from the ground up, we’re still here. Still resisting. Still building. And we haven’t lost our belief that another world is possible, even when the system slides deeper into fascism.Eric Morrison-Smith is executive director of the Alliance for Boys and Men of Color.

For Brics, heft matters. It now counts 11 member states – includingIndonesia, which joined this year – representing half the world’s population and40%of the global economy,outpacingthe G7 by $20tn.Yet its size hides its contradictions. The grouping’s call for moreinclusiveglobal institutions sounds welcome, but there is a preponderance ofautocracieswithin its own ranks. Brics is right thatinternational lawshould be upheld in Middle Eastern conflicts. But it climbs down from its moral pedestal bycondemningUkraine’s strikes on Russian infrastructure – while staying silent on Moscow’s relentless attacks on civilians.The acronym “Bric” – Brazil, Russia, India and China (South Africa wouldn’t join until 2010) – began as a Wall Streetbeton rising powers challenging the west. But whatdefinesBrics today is a subtler, more strategic ambition: to insulate themselves from Washington’s gravitational pull while cooperating to build a joint hi-tech industrial base. There are things that the Brics get right. Financial global institutions such as theInternational Monetary Fundare in need of reform; the rich world has failed tohonourclimate finance promises. The group’s understandable response in the face of inaction is to create its owndevelopment bankto promote a form of green industrialisation.A pre-summitagreementon a formal collective Brics stance on funding climate action will help. Rapid growth in renewable energy means fossil fuels now account forless than halfof the bloc’s total electricity generation. Given the climate emergency, such progress can only be welcome. Brics memberstatesnow lead ingreen techand boast booming consumer markets – offering both the tools and the scale to drive industrial growth.The postwar order stood on three pillars: US dominance, hydrocarbons and open trade. Today, all three are cracking, largely because of the US itself. Many Brics nations have little to gain from backing oil when the world’sbiggest producer is the US. Donald Trump’sthreatof higher import duties on the bloc’s members speaks to the US turn against global trade. By placingtariffson Brazil over its internal politics, Mr Trump turns economic diplomacy into personal vendetta – and highlights how the rules-based order is unravelling.This moment presents both a challenge and an opening. Tariffed in the west, Chinese firms pivot to Brics. So the United Arab Emirates cashes in – winning local production and techtransfersfrom Beijing that the west won’t permit. Brics’ vision of smart, clean growth fits the gaps in the global order. But it isn’t united:Russia’sgreen potential is buried under itsfossil fuel policy.Saudi Arabiahedges – flirting with Brics while clinging to the US, with deals in the balance. Most of the group’s member states are nervous that a powerfulChinacould tower over the rest. Strikingly, however, its leader, Xi Jinping, did not attend this summit.The Brics nations can still close ranks. Their most technical yet revealing move is to start building financial “plumbing” to bypass western systems. The group isn’t ditching the dollar – but its members know what exclusion feels like: India hadcreditdenied after the 2008 crash; Iranian banks have beensanctionedsince 2012. The bloc’ssuccesswill depend not just on ambition, but on the capacity to coordinate across national interests.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Private criminal prosecutions, which can be initiated by individuals, companies or charities, can give people a shot at justice. They can also be open to abuse. The Post Office brought918 successful private prosecutionsagainst its employees to protect its own commercial interests – at a shocking human cost laid bareby an official reportlast week. Rail companies take the draconian measure of prosecuting people for mistakenly buying the incorrect ticket: in 2023, a woman received acriminal recordfor erroneously using her railcard to save a total of £1.60.In the context of a depleted justice budget, these prosecutions appear especially dystopian, allowing the wealthy to pay for their day in court. No official record exists for the number now taking place, though available data suggests there has been a steep increase. In 2014,32 “costs orders”(the instruction a court gives to pay another party’s legal expenses) were awarded to private prosecutions. By 2019, this had risen to 276. Organisations such as the DVLA and TV Licensing have long used these prosecutions for routine violations. But funding cuts to the criminal justice system are making them more common, and creating what the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) calls a“two-tier justice system”.At their best, private prosecutions provide a safety valve against state malfeasance or inaction. The parents of the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence famously brought one against the five main suspects in 1994, after the CPS declined to prosecute. For victims of fraud, meanwhile, a private prosecution may be their only route to justice. In 20044.1m cases of fraudwere recorded in England and Wales – yetjust 6%of all cases reported to Action Fraud, theineffective national hotline, are actually referred to the police. Of these,fewer than 1%result in an offender being charged or prosecuted.In these cases, a private prosecution may be a person’s only hope. But the risks aren’t hard to grasp. Onaverage, it costs £8,500 to bring one, putting justice out of reach for many. Counterintuitively, they can also be more expensive for the state. Private prosecutors can recover their costs from the Ministry of Justice, which paid outmore than £11mto those who brought private prosecutions through the crown courts in 2020.A supermarket chain can bring a private prosecution against a shoplifter and have its costs covered by the taxpayer, while most victims of fraud will never hear back from the police. If the state can afford to pay for the prosecution of financial crimes against companies, why isn’t it prepared to ensure the police and CPS have enough resources to prosecute similar offences against ordinary people? This discrepancy sends a message that certain crimes, particularly fraud targeting individuals, aren’t a matter for public concern.After the Post Office scandal, the Labour government has recognised the need for new safeguards. A recent consultation from theMinistry of Justicesuggested that a compulsory code of conduct and an accreditation system would stop private prosecutions from being abused. But the government must go further. It is only a properly resourced criminal justice system that will prevent justice from being the equivalent of a gated community in Britain – where access depends on your ability to pay.Explore more on these topicsUK criminal justiceOpinionCrown Prosecution ServicePost Office Horizon scandalDVLABBC licence feeStephen LawrenceeditorialsShareReuse this content"

He has already been mocked and memed on social media. It was a hugely frustrating way to get out, made all the more so by its context. England were 87 for three at the time and paddling for the interval, still semi-intact despite a high grade opening spell from Mohammed Siraj and a bizarrely wicketless Jasprit Bumrah.Brook and Joe Root were at the wicket, the match all set to veer decisively one way either side of lunch. At which point Brook decided it would be tactically smart to sweep an 83mph ball from Akash Deep, pre-programmed, already going down, and exposing his middle stump which was duly clanked out of the ground.This was an act of such decorative abandon it felt like watching a pair of escapers crawling for the barbed wire fence, dodging the watchtower lights, only for one of them to decide to stand up and put on an impromptu feat of juggling with a sabre, two grapefruits and a bowling ball.Brook was playing beautifully at the time, striking the ball with rare clarity on a tough pitch. The previous over from Deep he had gone four, four, six to move to 23 off 18 balls. Both of the first two boundaries came from the Hedgehog Sweep, rolling into a ball and scooping to fine leg, the second one almost for six.The energy had begun to shift in the ground, a buzz of counterattack in the air. Right up to the moment Brook tried the same thing again in Deep’s next over and produced what looks, in isolation, like a witless swipe.That moment will be well-seasoned red meat to those predisposed to see only feckless entitlement in the Baz-bro mindset, a cult of alpha dog amour-propre. And yet, and yet, and yet. In context, well, it kind of scans.There are two other things worth saying about it. The first is that this was an excellent piece of captaincy. Shubman Gill might have taken Deep off after the previous over, which also saw him pumped into the pavilion by Brook with a lovely sense of open-shouldered freedom.Instead Gill kept him on and moved deep backward square leg finer for the ramp shot. India had read their man. The field change encouraged the same shot but squarer. Deep produced a fine delivery, too full for the shot, tailing late, and smashing into the base of middle stump.Never interrupt your opponent when he’s making a mistake, as Sun Tzu, patron saint of inspirational business brunches, once said. This was Bazball decoded. And India’s attack were excellent all day, complementary methods expertly deployed.The second thing, and the real Brook apologia, is that the thought behind the shot did at least make some kind of tactical sense. Conditions had been tricky though the morning. Zak Crawley was basically placed in the stocks in the opening half hour, hit on the hand, wafting constantly, edging and clothing every drive. It was like watching India bowl at a very brave, earnest hatstand.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is something adorable about his own version of the rolling sweep, knees bent, paws coiled. It’s like watching Paddington bat. But he went slashing for the north circular, leaving Ollie Pope to start, as ever, like a man trying to evade a sniper in the stands.This was the context of Brook’s counterattack, a need to reverse the momentum. Like all outcome-based things, when it fails it looks both wrong and utterly avoidable. But it was at least logical, as opposed to a random brain fade. Even half an hour of batting like this might have shifted the score significantly in a tight game.The fact is Brook has succeeded like this before. There is a misconception his record is based on flat tracks, on bullying tired bowlers. But there have been some breathtaking tough-pitch hundreds to date in his Test career, compiled playing the same way that killed him at Lord’s.The hundred in his third Test in Multan came in a game where nobody else got one. There was acentury off 107 ballswhen it was doing loads in Wellington,another in Christchurchlast November,123 off 115 balls in Wellingtonagain when England had been 43 for four.The shapes were terrible here. The highlights reel will look infuriating. But this was at least a thing that has worked before. The difference is to India’s credit: excellent captaincy and a good piece of bowling. Plus Brook’s own learning curve, the sense of reaching for too much of a good thing all at once.From that point England struggled to 192 on the back of some graft from Root and Ben Stokes, then took four wickets of their own late on. This Test has now become one of those epic slow burn affairs, there to be won by the seizing of key moments. Brook, at the very least, tried his hand.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025India cricket teamCricketEngland cricket teamanalysisShareReuse this content"

While they prepare to face Germany here on Saturday, the 2017 European champions head back to Amsterdam with their latest head coach bidding them farewell.Jonker will be replaced next month by the England assistant coach Arjan Veurink but at least he departed raging against the dying of the light in the course of an opening as dramatic as the thunder and lightning that prefaced torrential pre-match rain at St Jakob-Park.It represented bad news for those fans who had crayoned the French tricolour on to their cheeks or painted their faces bonfire bright Dutch orange. Rivulets of carefully applied colour were still dripping on to chins when, as suddenly as it begun, that apocalyptic storm ended and the sky brightened in time for kick-off.Netherlands supporters detected sunnier times ahead when the France goalkeeper Pauline Peyraud-Magnin was quickly forced to dive low to deny the Arsenal midfielder Victoria Pelova from distance.Attacking urgency represented their team’s sole hope of progression from Group D but, much as it sent excitement levels soaring inside the stadium, this exhilaratingly gung-ho approach invited counterattacks. Daphne van Domselaar saved with her legs from the ever dangerous Cascarino, before tipping Sakina Karchaoui’s follow-up shot round a post as the rain started falling again.Given that Bonadei’s side required a draw, at most, to progress there was a sense France were playing within themselves as, with initially mixed results, they attempted to draw Dutch sting by slowing things down at every opportunity and taking their time over dead balls.Such patience proved a virtue, temporarily at least, when the unmarked Sandie Toletti half-volleyed France ahead after meeting Katoto’s fine left-wing cross following a damaging concession of possession by the Oranje.View image in fullscreenSandie Toletti (left) celebrates after scoring the first goal of the game for France.Photograph: Image Photo Agency/Getty ImagesNot that Dutch redemption was too far away. Although Peyraud-Magnin performed wonders to keep Chasity Grant’s volley out, Pelova delighted in lashing the rebound into the top corner.The psychological damage inflicted as England beat Jonker’s team 4-0 in Zurich was evaporating by the minute. By way of proving it, the Netherlands took the lead through Selma Bacha’s own goal after Peyraud-Magnin’s failure to deal with a cross.Although Bacha seemed well positioned to clear off the line she was wrong-footed by Lineth Beerensteyn’s fleeting touch, leaving the ball to rebound off her and ricochet into the net as a newly tense Bonadei folded his arms a little tighter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When a momentary loss of Dutch focus handed possession to Cascarino her game-changing lofted through ball left Katoto’s left foot to do the rest.Not to be upstaged, Cascarino swiftly registered an even more eye-catching goal from the edge of the area after dodging a couple of Dutch defenders before cutting inside and unleashing a dipping and unerring right-foot shot.Cascarino, suitably inspired, then scored again, polishing off the rebound after Katoto’s shot hit both posts.As serial underachievers at a series of major tournaments, France are horribly prone to hitting the metaphorical woodwork. Yet as Karchaoui scored their fifth goal, an immaculate left-foot penalty awarded after Kerstin Casparij’s foul on Melween N’Dongala, the sense grew that this time it might just be different.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Netherlands women's football teamFrance women's football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Pogacar, the race leader, said: “There are still two weeks to go and losing a rider today is a little bit to our disadvantage, but I’m pretty confident in my team.”The high temperatures that have settled on the race are to continue on Monday and the first mountain stage, from Ennezat to Le Mont-Dore Puy de Sancy, which takes in eight classified climbs through the Auvergne.For Oscar Onley the first lengthy climbs will be a sterling test of his resilience as the 22-year-old Scot arrives in the Massif Central in seventh, less than three minutes behind Pogacar. His Picnic–PostNL sports director, Matt Winston, said: “We want to take Oscar as far as we can in the race, but we also want to do that with no pressure.“Oscar is one of six riders in this race that have come from our development team and he’s done really well in a lot of one-week races. A three-week race is a little bit of an unknown, and maybe in week two or week three we’ll see a bit of a drop off, but for now we keep fighting.”Steve Cummings is a past stage winner in the Tour’s furnace conditions. The 44-year-old, now sports director at the Jayco AlUla team, won a baking mountain stage to Mende in 2015. “I rode well in the heat, which is odd because I’m from the Wirral,” Cummings said.“There’s two things: preparation, to make sure you’re ready and managing your core temperature in the race. There’s ‘ice socks’” – tights stuffed with ice cubes, placed between the shoulder blades – “which is more perceptual than cooling the core temperature, but it makes a difference because it’s psychologically beneficial. The theory is that cooling from the inside out is quite beneficial. The challenge operationally is getting a regular flow of cool drinks to the riders.”Cummings also cited ice baths, but added that they do not attract universal approval. “When I was a rider, there was an ice bath following us around at the Vuelta a España one year, but nobody ever used the thing. Other teams use them every day. We have the ice socks and the vehicles will have fridges with more drinks. Right now, I don’t think any team would dare run out of drinks.”Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tadej PogacarTour de FranceCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

Mohamed Salah was visibly moved by the ovation for his club’s “Forever 20”. It was the aftermath of a poignant and important afternoon for Liverpool that left the deepest impression, however.For seven minutes after the pre‑season friendly, staged 10 days after the brothers were killed in a car accident in north‑western Spain,Liverpoolfans in the Bill Shankly Stand sang Jota’s name on repeat. And for those seven minutes Liverpool’s players, coaches and backroom staff stood facing their fans and clapped in unison with the tribute. The connection and the release, if only brief and only temporary, vindicated Liverpool’s decision to get back to work and play.Liverpool retire No 20 shirt in honour of Diogo Jota after forward’s deathRead moreDeepdale delivered thoughtful tributes throughout Liverpool’s 3-1 win. Preston’s captain, Ben Whiteman, walked out alone before kick-off carrying a wreath he laid in front of the away fans, while You’ll Never Walk Alone wassung beautifullyand an image of Jota and Silva from their Porto days filled the giant screen.Understandably, Liverpool did not conduct any pre- or post-match interviews but Arne Slot spoke movingly to the club’s in-house media before the game. The head coach spoke of finding comfort in the fact that Jota “in the last month of his life, he was achampion in everything” – with Liverpool, Portugal and his young family, having married Rute Cardoso 11 days before his death. Slot added that the support Liverpool have received not only from their own fans but from Everton, from around the country and across the world meant that “to represent this club in this city now even means more to me and to my wife than it did before”.View image in fullscreenA Liverpool fan holds a photo in memory of Diogo Jota before the match against Preston.Photograph: Ed Sykes/Action Images/ReutersSlot’s take on the friendly itself was powerful. His message could also apply to what lies ahead for Liverpool in what is certain to be the most trying of seasons. Should Jota’s grieving teammates retain their Premier League title it will rank as a truly extraordinary achievement, along with a fitting and emotional tribute. And if they don’t, well, it will not really matter.“Nothing seems to be important if we think of what has happened,” said Slot. “But we are a football club and we need to train and we need to play again, if we want it or not. What I’ve said to the players, I can say it here as well. It’s very difficult to find the right words because we constantly debate what is appropriate. What is appropriate in our actions? What is appropriate [for] what we have to say? Can we train again? Can we laugh again? Can we be angry if there’s a wrong decision?“I’ve said to them, maybe the best thing for us to do is handle this situation like Jota was. And what I meant with that is that Jota was always himself, it didn’t matter if he was talking to me, to his teammates, to the staff, he was always himself. So let us try to be ourselves as well. So, if we want to laugh we laugh; if we want to cry we’re going to cry. If they want to train they can train, if they don’t want to train they can not train. But be yourself, don’t think you have to be different than your emotions tell you.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So too did Darwin Núñez’s response to scoring Liverpool’s second goal. Having capitalised on a weak back-pass to round Preston’s goalkeeper, Daniel Iversen, the Uruguay international re-enacted two of Jota’s goal celebrations – the “Baby Shark” he performed for his children after scoring against Everton and the “gamer” celebration that has now become a tribute to him from footballers all over the world. Cody Gakpo also did the shark celebration after completing Liverpool’s win.The goal meant much more to Núñez than it would in normal circumstances and he pointed to the heavens after his Jota‑inspired celebrations.

To the west, heart and soul was the talk of the city overrun with red and white shirts, Wales desperate for their heart, their Welsh spirit, to help them overcome a huge gap in quality and professional development over their neighbours England.There would beno healing of the soul for Wales, though there is plenty of heart to take from their first major tournament appearance drawn in the toughest of groups. Two goals, including one in St Gallen, set up by the mercurial Jess Fishlock and scored by Hannah Cain against England, were the reward for their labour against Europe’s elite.England surge into last-eight after Stanway sparks emphatic win against WalesRead moreOn the rammed buses and then walk to Arena St Gallen the mood was high, and chants echoed back and forth between rival fans. There was banter aplenty and a loud: “It’s whatsherface!” was shouted by a fan who rushed to get a photo with the comedian Maisie Adam; she and her fellow stand-up Suzi Ruffell were stopped by fans desperate for selfies every few paces.For the Lionesses, the6-1 win over Waleswas an example of how to manage emotions rather than be consumed by them. A businesslike focus had settled over the side in the buildup to the fixture, the hard yards run in Zurich against the Netherlands, in St Gallen they “just” needed to win and the goal celebrations were minimal. This was a game ruled by emotion for Wales but not for the European champions, who had already shifted into knockout mode.Critically, Sarina Wiegman has found the formation with the personnel to fit it that makes England a formidable force and serious contenders. The setup in the first game against France had been experimental, Lauren James placed in the No 10 role despite having just returned from a hamstring injury.It didn’t work. After a thrilling start England struggled with a lack of stability in the middle, James was, rightly, allowed to roam, leaving a below-par Keira Walsh and Georgia Stanway overrun.Against the Netherlands the shifting of James to the right, in place of Beth Mead, and the return of Ella Toone in the middle proved fruitful. Against Wales, the fruit was ripened, Lucy Bronze and James’s partnership on the right restored and reminiscent at times of the blistering axis established by Bronze and Nikita Parris at the 2019 World Cup.View image in fullscreenLauren James has benefited from being moved to the right after starting the first match of Euro 2025 in the No 10 role.Photograph: Eurasia Sport Images/Getty ImagesAgainst the Dutch Walsh was the supporting act to the Bronze and James show whereas here, under candy-floss-coloured clouds as the sun set against Wales, it was Toone who connected with the right flank and the movement, passing and runs between the gut-busting trio were electric.It was England’s right that produced the third and fourth goals. First James paused on the ball, time almost standing still as Toone overlapped. The ball was finally played to Toone, who sent in a cross that was met by Lauren Hemp at the far post and nodded in. For the fourth Bronze, James and Toone combined again, fast-paced passing in their constantly shifting tight triangle bamboozling the Wales defence, in particular Lily Woodham, who was hooked at half‑time, before Toone broke to the byline and pulled back to Alessia Russo, who poked in.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Alex Greenwood’s shift back into her old left-back berth for Jess Carter to fit more comfortably in alongside the centre-back Leah Williamson proved desperately needed. With Hemp ahead of her, the left is as threatening as the right, making it harder for opponents to pinpoint and stifle England’s attack.The magical flow of England’s flanks was disrupted a little at the break, with Toone and Hemp off in place of Jess Park and Mead, but England’s greatest asset is the strength in the depth of the squad. James was replaced by Chloe Kelly later, as was Russo by Aggie Beever‑Jones and Bronze made way with 11 minutes remaining too. Freed of the threat of an exit by the first-half feast, England’s entire frontline and right were changed but still the goals kept coming.Eight days ago, England’s group-stage obituaries were being contemplated in not-so-hushed circles after a bruising and frustrating2-1 loss to France. Now, afterLes Bleues’defeat of the Netherlands, England’s second-place finish leaves an enticing route to the final. They have avoided Spain on their side of the draw, with a quarter-final against Sweden next. Critically, England’s diversity in attack, threat from both flanks and extreme depth in those areas have them looking very difficult to play against.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamWales women's football teamWomen's footballanalysisShareReuse this content"

We created great chances like we did against the Netherlands and now we have to break down Sweden.”A key part of England’s improved form during a tough Group D was a shift in gameplan from Wiegman and the coaching staff. One change has been the introduction of Ella Toone back into the No 10 role against the Netherlands with the ever-creative Lauren James moving out to the right.Keira Walsh, the Uefa player of the match, credited Toone for England’s change in fortunes. “She’s come in and done an incredible job,” she said. “People speak about her offensively, but the defensive work she does for me and Georgia [Stanway] when she’s in [the No 10 role] is incredible. She covers a lot of spaces that we can’t.“That’s probably been the main thing that’s stopped other teams from playing. Obviously with Lauren James on the wing, we’ve managed to get both of them on the pitch at the same time and they are two world-class players.”In her two tournament appearances, Toone has looked back to her best. A goal and two assists in 45 minutes against Wales made her a standout performer and her 100% pass completion rate caught the eye.“I feel like I’m in a really good place,” the 25-year-old said. “I’ve missed this Ella Toone. I’ve not had it for a while. I feel like I’m really coming into it and I’m really enjoying it. I love playing with these girls. I love the football that we play.“I feel like I’m in a good mindset and enjoying my football and that’s when I’m probably playing my best so it was nice to get two assists and another goal tonight. Hopefully I can keep continuing in that form.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think the intensity in the last two games – we’ve really attacked. In defence, we’ve tried to win the ball back really fast so I think we’re happy with where we’re at.“Sarina [Wiegman] wanted us to be confident and to enjoy it. We obviously play better football when we do that. There was more flow to the game tonight and better connections so we just have to keep that going and keep the momentum up in the next game.”England will face Sweden next in the quarter-finals, an opposition that they are well-acquainted with. “They’re always very powerful,” Wiegman said. “They have speed up front on the counterattack. They are a hard team to beat and have done well in the group. We will see and we will get ready.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Sarina WiegmanEngland women's football teamWales women's football teamWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

McIlroy shared second with Marco Penge.“I hung in there like a champ and finished it off in style,” Gotterup said. “I was ready for the challenge, I knew I was playing well this week so I felt comfortable.

Few expected Gotterup to put up much resistance but the 25-year-old was nerveless. McIlroy’s inward half of level par proved problematic as ­Gotterup came home in two under. This was, however, McIlroy’s finest tournament display since his Masters triumph.Gotterup had to withstand the extra pressure associated with being put on the clock for slow play during the closing stages of the tournament. By the 72nd tee, Gotterup was two clear. He will make his Open debut on Thursday.

If Arsenal had met ­Sporting’s initial €70m asking price under stan­dard terms, the Portuguese club would have netted roughly €63m after fees. Under the new arrangement, they will receive slightly more without losing a cut to intermediaries.Tensions between Gyökeres and Sporting have grown in recent weeks as he has made no secret of his desire to join ­Arsenal. But their president, Frederico ­Varandas, had insisted they would not budge over their valuation of a player who scored 54 times in 52 games last season. He confirmed that Sporting intend to fine Gyökeres unless he can present a legitimate justification for his absence, such as medical reasons, extended leave authorised by the board, or an urgent family matter.“We are calm,” Varandas said on Saturday evening. “Everything can be resolved with the close of the transfer window, a heavy fine and an apology to the group.” With ­reference to Arsenal he said: “If they don’t want to pay Viktor’s fair market value we are very comfortable with that for the next three years.”Arsenal are also expected to make a new approach for Christian Mosquera this week after their initial bid of £14m was rejected by Valencia. The Spain Under-21 defender has already agreed personal terms for a move to the Emirates Stadium.Leandro Trossard could be sold to help balance the books, with Bayern Munich the latest club to show an interest in him. The Belgium forward has also been linked with Fenerbahce and clubs in Saudi Arabia and is likely to cost around £20m.Noni Madueke is close to finalisinghis £52m move from Chelseato Arsenal and is poised for his medical this week. The 23-year-old will sign a five-year contract.Arsenal have also made progress in negotiations over a new contract for Ethan Nwaneri, who has attracted interest from Chelsea and clubs in Germany but is expected tojoin his fellow academy graduate Myles Lewis-Skellyin agreeing a deal to stay.Explore more on these topicsArsenalSportingTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

Rowland sealed the title by taking fourth place in the second of two races at the penultimate meeting of the all-electric series’ season at Tempelhof airport.Rowland was reduced to tears on his in-lap after starting eighth on the grid in a hugely competitive race. The lead changed hands 16 times, including Rowland taking to the front, in what might be considered the race of the year in the sport’s 11th season and which represents the first time Nissan have taken the drivers’ title in Formula E.Marc Márquez wins crash-filled German MotoGP as just 10 riders complete raceRead more“Daddy, you’re the world champion!” Rowland’s four-year-old daughter, Harper, exclaimed proudly to him over the team radio as the 32-year-old from Barnsley returned to the pits.The championship is the first of Rowland’s career in his seventh season in Formula E. He has seen off a strong challenge from the Porsche of the former Formula One driver Pascal Wehrlein, the defending champion, but Rowland has been the dominant driver in the series this year to achieve a career high.“I was already an emotional mess when that came on,” Rowland said of his daughter’s message. “We are a team; my wife, my daughter. We have another one on the way and we go through the emotions together..”This win comes only two years after Rowland was disenchanted with the performance of his Mahindra team, so much so that he left them midway through the season and considered leaving the sport altogether. “There was a point where I was not very interested in continuing,” he said. “I wasn’t enjoying myself, I found myself not wanting to get on flights to come to races. That was a problem.View image in fullscreenOliver Rowland fought off strong competition from the former Formula One driver Pascal Wehrlein.Photograph: Paulo Maria/DPPI/Shutterstock“I took a big risk to pull out halfway through the season, from a good contract. I had nothing on the table ready for me to sign. I took a big risk but I knew I needed something different.”Rowland managed to secure a return to Nissan and this season has taken four wins and seven podiums for the team, enough to ensure he could close the championship out with two races remaining, at the season finale in London at the end of this month.Sunday’s race was impressively won by Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy from 21st on the grid. But Rowland pulled out an equally excellent recovery.

Wehrlein duly led in the early stages, looking in every position to take the fight to the final meeting. However, he went backwards in the second half of the race, stymied by his energy strategy, and finished outside the points.Rowland began his career in Formula Renault before moving up to GP2. He won the chance for a test with the Red Bull F1 team and was taken on as part of the Renault young driver programme, becoming their development driver in 2017. He became a junior driver for Williams in 2018 and completed a full test of their car at Hungary that year.Wanting to continue racing, he took his first full-time drive in Formula E with the Nissan team in the 2018-19 season. He then spent two seasons with Mahindra between 2021 and 2023 before what has turned out to be an enormously successful return with Nissan.Explore more on these topicsMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

He has stretched his championship lead over his brother, Álex, who finished second, to 83 points. Marc’s teammate, Francesco Bagnaia, finished third and sits 147 points behind.Marc Márquez wins battle of brothers to delight Ducati fans at Italian GPRead moreÁlex had started fifth on the grid and took second in his 100th MotoGP start, despite still recovering from a fractured hand he suffered at the Dutch GP two weeks ago which required surgery.Several riders crashed over the course of the race, especially at turn one – including VR46 Racing’s Fabio Di Giannantonio and Aprilia’s Marco Bezzecchi, who both crashed out when they were in second. But the day belonged to Marc Márquez as he marked his latest triumph at his favourite hunting ground by standing on his bike and doing a jig as he passed the chequered flag – a fourth straight weekend where he has won both the sprint and the race.“One more [win at the Sachsenring] was super special. From the beginning, I felt good, the confidence when I started the weekend was super high because we were coming from three victories in a row,” Marc said. “We are in an incredible moment. Now we can say that half the season is done, [but] we still need to be super concentrated.”View image in fullscreenMarc Márquez (right) congratulates his brother, Álex Márquez, after they finished first and second.Photograph: Filip Singer/EPAMarc Márquez had clinched his seventh pole position of the season on Saturday before winning a wet sprint despite a mistake at the first turn, but this time he had the dream start to take the lead into turn one ahead of Bezzecchi and Di Giannantonio. As he slowly but surely started to stretch his lead, the two Italians swapped places while Álex Márquez and Pedro Acosta fought for fourth on the sweeping corners. Acosta became the third rider to crash early on after Lorenzo Savadori and Miguel Oliveira, with the young Spaniard gesturing at his fallen machine in frustration.Di Giannantonio had broken the lap record in Friday’s practice and given the championship leader a tough time early in the sprint. But the Italian was unable to push any harder to catch up to Márquez Sr, who found a comfortable rhythm and pace to surge more than two seconds ahead, despite easing off the throttle on two laps to conserve his tyres.As the lead stretched to more than three seconds, Di Giannantonio’s challenge came to an end on the downhill braking zone on turn one when he lost control and crashed, with his bike tumbling across the gravel while he escaped unhurt. LCR Honda’s Johann Zarco, who started second on the grid before getting pushed down the order, crashed at the same turn seconds later.View image in fullscreenMarco Bezzecchi is checked over by race stewards after crashing out.Photograph: Gold & Goose Photography/Getty ImagesBezzecchi had moved up to second but the Aprilia rider also bit the dust on the very next lap at turn one, moving Álex up to second while Bagnaia suddenly found himself in the podium positions. Trackhouse Racing’s Ai Ogura then lost his balance on turn one and ended up taking out Honda’s Joan Mir in the process, leaving only 10 of the 18 starters still standing.“I tried to give my 100%” said Álex Marquez, holding an ice pack on his left hand. “Also, I was a little bit lucky because [riders] sliding in front of me crashed. But this is racing, so you need to be there,Today, it was important to survive … So I’m really, really happy. It’s unbelievable to be here [after surgery].”Yamaha’s Fabio Quartararo finished fourth ahead of Álex’s Gresini Racing teammate, Fermin Aldeguer.

The latest snapshot covering the three months to May is due to be published on Thursday.Separate HMRC figures show more than 250,000 jobs have been lost in the UK since Reeves’s autumn budget.Neil Carberry, chief executive of the REC, said: “Much of that [hiring] hesitation stems from the scar tissue left by the spring tax hikes and fear of further business tax rises.“But underlying this, there are some signs of improving demand. Temporary vacancies, especially in the private sector, are resilient. And we are seeing more sectors adding vacancies in construction, logistics, engineering and healthcare.

The trade body the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) said last week it expected pub closures ata rate of more than one a day during 2025, adding to the 350 net closures during 2024. It said business rates were a factor in those closures.The industry argues that the current system, based on the rateable value of the property, means businesses must pay the tax even when they are losing money. The crucial valuation on which rates are based is “fair maintainable turnover”, a measure that looks at how much a pub should expect to sell in a year, without necessarily taking into account changes to costs.Pubs also tend to occupy high-value buildings, while being run on very tight profit margins, meaning business rates bills can be much larger than might be expected.“Pubs are going to be around for the long term, but we need to address the unfairness in the system to allow them to flourish,” he said.“It isn’t fair that the sector has 0.4% of the rateable property but pays 2.1% of the bills. The sector is a massive employer and incredibly important for local communities, so we just feel it is important to underline how beneficial it is to tax pubs fairly.”Greene King, which runs 2,600 pubs, restaurants and hotels, reported a loss of £147m before tax in its 2024 financial year. It said that pubs faced a layering of unavoidable costs that were changing the economics of the sector, making it more difficult to survive. Those costs included the impact ofincreases to employers’ national insurance contributionsimposed in the October budget by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves. Unlike corporation tax, the national insurance measure does not take account of profitability, adding to costs even for heavily loss-making pubs.Business rates costs for pubs increased this year. Along with other hospitality businesses, they were given 75% relief from business rates during the coronavirus pandemic, but Reeves cut the relief to 40% in the budget in October.More than252,000 shops, cafes, pubs, restaurantsand other hospitality businesses such as bowling alleys were affected by the change, according to estimates by the consultant Altus Group. It said the change would impose extra costs of £545m on the sector.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They argue that current guidance, which allows headteachers to decide how smartphones are used, is unlawful and unsafe for children.The Department for Education now has 14 days to officially respond to the letter, after which point the claimants can issue judicial review proceedings.Ofcom head says age checks are ‘really big moment’ for children’s online safetyRead moreThe DfE said schools already had the power to ban phones and it was bringing in “better protections” from harmful content throughthe Online Safety Act.A national survey ordered by Rachel de Souza, the children’s commissioner for England, published in April revealed that 90% of all schools in Englandhave banned mobile phone use by pupils. The survey found that 79% of secondary schools allowed students to keep their phones while banning their use or display, while 8% required phones to be handed in, and 3% stopped pupils from bringing them to school altogether.The two fathers, who have brought their claim under the nameGeneration Alpha, argue that smartphones are still being used dangerously and the safest approach for children would be a complete ban on smartphones in schools.Orr-Ewing said there was evidence that devices were being used to access harmful “very violent or sexual” content or for cyberbullying.“We know that when children use smartphones they usually don’t do it in a safe way,” he said. “Parents have told us about boys being filmed naked in the PE changing rooms and then shared across the school.”Girls were “being manipulated by predators on messaging platforms during lessons and in school toilets” and “tiny children” were being shown “graphic pornography” on the school bus by other children, he added.The fathers said a ban on smartphones was a “no-brainer”, and argued that children should only have “brick phones” to communicate with parents if needed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Schools should “carefully consider how this is managed”, it stated.Montgomery said there was evidence that schools were still not taking the necessary steps to safeguard children. The pair made freedom of information requests to schools in England about safeguarding incidents related to smartphones and social media; one school had passed 55 such incidents to social services in the last academic year, 17 of which were referred to the police.“A statutory ban would be a huge relief for headteachers and parents alike,” he said.The DfE said: “Schools already have the power to ban phones, and we support headteachers to take the necessary steps to prevent disruption, backed by our clear guidance on how to restrict their use. We know there are wider issues with children’s online experiences, which is why we are also bringing in better protections from harmful content through the Online Safety Act.”Explore more on these topicsInternet safetySmartphonesSchoolsParents and parentingChildren's healthChildrenBridget PhillipsonnewsShareReuse this content"

One rally-goer, Corey Comperatore, was killed before the shooter, a 20-year-old nursing-home worker from Pennsylvania named Thomas Matthew Crooks, was shot dead by a Secret Service agent. Crooks scaled a building overlooking the rally and opened fire using anAR015-style rifle.Blood and bravado: the Trump shooting upended an election and shook the USRead moreThe image of Trump defiantly raising his fist in the immediate aftermath of the attack became a politicaltouchstone, helping push Joe Biden out of the race and fuelling support around his presidency in a heightened, accelerated manner.The committee behind this latest report, chaired by Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, conducted 17 interviews with members of theSecret Serviceand reviewed thousands of legal documents before it reached its conclusion. While it offers no new information on Crooks’s motives, which are still ambiguous almost a year on, it does shine light on the supposed disorganization and disarray of the security agency as the assassination unfolded.The investigators found that the Secret Service “denied or left unfulfilled” multiple requests for additional staff and assets, and despite acknowledgements of vulnerabilities at the venue, assigned an inexperienced operator to oversee operations.“What happened was inexcusable,” the committee stated, adding that “the consequences imposed for the failures so far do not reflect the severity of the situation.”Six Secret Service agents havesince been suspendedwithout pay after the events last July. Their suspensions range from 10 to 42 days, with a loss of both salary and benefits during their absence.This disciplinary action comes nearly a year after the shooting. The agency’s deputy director, Matt Quinn, told CBS News that the Secret Service would not “fire our way out of this” crisis.Explore more on these topicsSecret ServiceDonald Trump Pennsylvania rally shootingUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

In May,a Department of Justice memosaid the False Claims Act would be used against federal contractors “knowingly engaging in racist preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities, including through diversity, equity, and inclusion programs that assign benefits or burdens on race, ethnicity, or national origin,” promising “sharing in any monetary recovery” to whistleblowers who bring successful anti-DEI lawsuits.A UK government spokesperson saidit was“committed to introducing disability and ethnicity pay gap reporting into legislation in the king’s speech.

And so what we’re expecting to see then is that any company that shows material that shouldn’t be available to under-18s, pornography, suicide and self-harm material – that should be either removed from their service or they’re going to need highly effective age checks to screen out under-18s.”She added: “It is a very big moment for the industry, a very serious moment.”View image in fullscreenMelanie Dawes (left) said age checks were ‘a very big moment for the industry’.Photograph: Jeff Overs/BBC/PAThe rules, which come in on 25 July, are the latest elements to be enacted from the Online Safety Act, which the Conservatives passed in 2023.That act was brought partly in response to criticism from campaigners such as Ian Russell, whose 14-year-old daughter, Molly,died in 2017from an act of self-harm after viewing several thousand pieces of online content relating to depression, self-harm and suicide.Tory ministersremoved sections of the billin 2022, however, amid an internal row over whether it went too far by banning certain types of content deemed to be “legal but harmful”.Russell, who has previously called the act “timid”, said on Sunday he was worried about how it was being enforced byOfcom. The regulator has told technology companies they can choose how to carry out verification checks, but will assess how well they are working.Russell said: “The Ofcom PR is often spun such that it sounds like everything will change for the better in a matter of weeks. But I think it’s quite clear that Ofcom, as a regulator, needs to do more than just be good at spinning their PR. They need to act within the bounds of the act in the strongest possible way, and they’re not doing that.“They’re sitting in the middle, pushed on one side by families who’ve lost people, like me, and pushed on the other side by the power of the big tech platforms.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Chi Onwurah, the Labour MP who chairs the science and technology committee, said the Online Safety Act “just isn’t up to scratch”.Dawes refused to call for powers to tackle misinformation, however, saying: “If parliament decides to widen those towards mis- and disinformation, or wider issues around addiction for the kids, for example, then, of course, Ofcom stands ready to implement that.”She did, however, take aim at the BBC followingthe row over its coverage of Glastonburyand whether it should have continued to broadcast footage of the band Bob Vylan after its lead singer led the crowd in anti-Israel chants.“The BBC need to get a grip quicker, get these reports and investigations [into the incident] concluded sooner,” she said. “Otherwise there is a real risk of a loss of confidence in the BBC.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

So today we’re announcing really big investment, £63m in charging infrastructure across the country – £25m for councils.”She said some of the money would be spent on new charging points, but the money for local authorities was to enable them to dig gullies under paving slabs to allow car owners to run charging cables across residential streets. An additional £30m would go to vehicle depots such as those used by the NHS.Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, pledged £400m for charging infrastructure over the next five years at last month’s spending review – part of a £1.4bn fund to support the uptake of all EVs.Just over 20% of new cars sold this year were electric, according to the data company Zap Map. But while the number of electric car sales increased by about 240% from 2021 to 2024, they still account for less than 5% of all the cars on British roads.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the Conservativesended the subsidies in 2022amid concerns that the policy was expensive and mainly benefited wealthier households, in a move that was heavily criticised by carmakers.The government is also seeking to boost domestic manufacturing of zero-emission vehicles, and separately announced on Sunday it would invest £2bn over the next five years on a range of technologies to help the industry.Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, said: “We’re helping British carmakers get to the front of the pack by working hand in hand with investors to build a globally competitive electric vehicle supply chain in the UK.”Explore more on these topicsTransport policyElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsHeidi AlexanderLocal governmentAutomotive industryTransportMotoringnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s not in doubt. I’m being as relentless in that as it can be.”He said: “The vast majority of our people are good people. But that legacy, combined with the tragedy that some of this crime falls most heavily in black communities, that creates a real problem because the legacy creates concern.”The commissioner added: “It’s not right that black boys growing up inLondonare more likely to be dead by the time they’re 18, far more likely than white boys. That’s, I think, shameful for the city. The challenge for us is, as we reach in to tackle those issues, that confrontation that comes from that reaching in, whether it’s stop and search on the streets or the sort of operations you seek.“The danger is that’s landing in an environment with less trust. And that makes it even harder. But the people who win out of that, [are] all of the criminals.”He added: “I’m so determined to find a way to get past this because if policing in black communities can find a way to confront these issues, together we can give black boys growing up in London equal life chances to white boys, which is not what we’re seeing at the moment.”Rowley said policing was not the only area that needed scrutiny, with black boys more likely to be excluded from school than white boys as an example. He went on to say that the criminal justice system was “close to broken” and could be “frustrating” for officers.He said: “The thing that is frustrating is that the system – and no system can be perfect – but when the system hasn’t managed to turn that person’s life around and get them on the straight and narrow, and it just becomes a revolving door. When that happens, of course that’s frustrating for officers.“So the more successful prisons and probation can be in terms of getting people on to a law-abiding life from the path they’re on, the better.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many hoped the retired major general would crack down on armed groups, just as he had as the country’s military head of state.Instead, violence that had mostly been confined to the north-east spread. That left swathes ofNigeriaoutside the control of the stretched security forces as gunmen in the north-west, armed separatists and gangs in the south-east roamed unchecked.Much of Buhari’s appeal lay in the anti-corruption ethos that was a central plank of his agenda as a military and civilian ruler. He said endemic corruption in Nigeria’s political culture was holding people back.But Buhari quickly disappointed after his 2015 win. He took six months to name his cabinet. During that time, the oil-dependent economy was hobbled by low crude prices, prompting people to call him “Baba Go Slow”.His second victory in 2019 came despite his first term being blighted by Nigeria’s first recession in a generation, militant attacks on oilfields, and repeated hospital stays.Nigeria election: ‘Mr Honesty’ tainted by failure to tackle corruptionRead moreBuhari was born on 17 December 1942 in Daura, in the north-west state of Katsina, and enrolled in the army at 19. He would eventually rise to the rank of major general.He seized power in 1983 as a military ruler, promising to revitalise a mismanaged country. Buhari took a tough line on everything from the conditions sought by the International Monetary Fund to unruliness in bus queues.In 1984, his administration attempted to kidnap a former minister and vocal critic living in Britain. The plot failed when London airport officials opened a crate containing the abducted politician.His first stint in power was short-lived. He was removed after only 18 months by another military officer, Ibrahim Babangida.Buhari spent much of the following 30 years in fringe political parties and trying to run for president until his eventual victory over Jonathan in 2015.Explore more on these topicsMuhammadu BuhariNigeriaGoodluck JonathanAfricaLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

She is a Threat to Humanity, and should remain in the wonderful Country ofIreland, if they want her.”The threat – which lacks an obvious legal pathway and raised further questions about Trump’s use of executive power – escalated a two-decade public feud between the pair.O’Donnell moved to Ireland earlier this year after Trump won a second White House term but they have continued to trade barbs.“You are everything that is wrong with america,” O’Donnell posted on Instagram, hours after his threat. “You want to revoke my citizenship? go ahead and try, king joffrey with a tangerine spray tan i’m not yours to silence i never was.” Joffrey is a villainous king in Game of Thrones.The actor also posted a 1980s-era photograph of Trump with Jeffrey Epstein, amidrenewed attentionon the president’s relationship with the disgraced financier.Explore more on these topicsCultureIrelandDonald TrumpSocial mediaEuropeDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

The blaze has forced officials to close access to that area for the season.The Grand Canyon Lodge, the only lodging inside the park at the North Rim, was consumed by the flames, park superintendent Ed Keable told park residents, staff and others in a meeting Sunday morning. He said the visitor center, the gas station, a waste water treatment plant, an administrative building and some employee housing also were lost.Two wildfires are burning at or near the North Rim, known as the White Sage fire and the Bravo Dragon fire, and have collectively burned more than 45,000 acres. The White Sage fire burned 40,126 acres (16,200 hectares) near the North Rim, while the Dragon Bravo fire, burning to the south within Grand Canyon national park, reached 5,000 acresaccording to InciWeb, a federal government wildfire tracker.The Bravo Dragon fire is the one that impacted the lodge and other structures. The park initially was managing it as a controlled burn but then shifted to suppression as it rapidly grew, fire officials said. It was sparked by lightning on 4 July.No injuries have been reported.After a thunderstorm on 9 July, the US Bureau of Land Management began receiving reports of smoke in the area of the White Sage fire.Wildfires force evacuations at two national parks in the US westRead moreOn Friday, the Coconino county sheriff’s office reported that the whole region was under evacuation and urged residents to leave immediately.Millions of people visit Grand Canyon national park annually, with most going to the more popular South Rim. The North Rim is open seasonally. It was evacuated last Thursday because of wildfire and will remain closed for the rest of the season, a park statement read.The burning of the water treatment plant resulted in the release of chlorine gas that prompted the evacuation of firefighters and hikers from the inner canyon, park officials said Sunday. Chlorine gas is heavier than air and can quickly settle into lower elevations such as the inner canyon, posing a health risk.Rafters on the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon also were told to bypass Phantom Ranch, which has a set of cabins and dormitories along the river.The Grand Canyon Lodge was often the first prominent feature that visitors see, even before viewing the canyon. A highway ends at the lodge, which was known for its sloped roof, huge ponderosa beams and massive limestone facade. By walking across the lobby and descending a stairwell, visitors could get their first view of the Grand Canyon shining through windows across the sun room.“It just feels like you’re a pioneer when you walk through there [the lodge],” said Tim Allen, a longtime resident of Flagstaff,Arizona, and yearly visitor to the Grand Canyon. “It really felt like you were in a time gone by.”Aramark, the company that operated the lodge, said all employees and guests were safely evacuated.“As stewards of some our country’s most beloved national treasures, we are devastated by the loss,” said spokesperson Debbie Albert.An original lodge burned down from a kitchen fire in 1932, four years after construction was completed, according to the Grand Canyon Historical Society. The redesigned lodge using the original stonework opened in 1937.Meanwhile, officials reported progress in battling a second wildfire burning north of the Grand Canyon. Fire lines on the White Sage Fire that forced evacuations at the North Rim and in the community of Jacob Lake were holding, officials said. On the southern edge of the fire, hand crews and bulldozers were working uphill, and the spread of the blaze had been minimal.But to the east and north, the fire has spread rapidly, with grasses and standing dead trees contributing to the fire’s intensity, officials said. The fire was pushing downhill toward the Vermilion Cliffs area, and crews were assessing opportunities to create buffer zones that help slow or halt the fire’s progress.Explore more on these topicsUS wildfiresNational parksArizonaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Later photograph: Pål Hansen/The Guardian. Styling: Andie Redman. Hair and makeup: John Christopher at Arlington Artists. Archive image: courtesy of Kerry GodlimanBorn in London in 1973, Kerry Godliman is a comedian and actor. She trained at Rose Bruford Drama School, before taking a course on standup comedy at the adult education college City Lit. In 2012, she was cast as Hannah in Ricky Gervais’s Derek, and has appeared in dramas including Save Me, Adult Material and Trigger Point, along with pursuing her career in live comedy and radio. Godliman hosts the Memory Lane podcast with Jen Brister, and is one of the judges of theComedy Women in Print Prize. She is married to actor Ben Abell and they have two children.This was taken at my mum’s 40th– a big house party where everyone dressed up. I was going through a 60s phase with the dress, the hair and the eyeliner – all of which was probably inspired by Deee-Lite. There would have been a lot of drinking and smoking and good music. Pretty raucous all round.I felt suburban and strait-laced during my childhood, but as I’ve got older I’ve realised my parents were quite bohemian. My dad was a violin-maker and worked in the shed, and my mum was a secondhand clothes dealer who was always studying something new. When it came to work, she wasn’t risk-averse and collected interesting people as friends. There was never anyone around our house who had an office job – no accountants popping in. I must have taken that on board when I chose my career. Being self-employed is all I knew.At the time this photo was taken, I was doing my GCSE retakes and about to start my A-levels. I may have failed some exams, but I don’t remember being that stressed about it. My general attitude was: “If I don’t get the grades, I’ll just do them again.” This picture captures my laid-back mindset perfectly.In my teen years, I was very committed to the local youth theatre in Ealing. It gave me a lot of my creative joy and a real sense of identity. Instead of doing musicals, we were more interested in gritty pieces about HIV. We once made a safe-sex video for Ealing council, during which I played a mum wearing an awful wig and chain-smoking. Not that that was too out of character. For the best part of a decade, there isn’t a photo of me without a fag in my hand.There was a lot of banter in my family and my childhood was a lot of fun. We watched tons of comedy on telly, especially Victoria Wood and Billy Connolly. I also enjoyed making the grownups laugh, which led to me wanting to try standup. I think if my parents hadn’t indulged me by laughing so much I wouldn’t be doing what I do now. There was also Miss Friend, a teacher at school, who was always encouraging. She once wrote in a report: “Kerry’s good, and she could pursue acting for a job … if she doesn’t muck around and waste too much time.”I followed the traditional pathinto acting: I got one line in The Bill, a couple of scenes in Casualty. It was very incremental and bitty. There were lots of “nearly” moments in my 20s – I nearly got a job at the Royal Shakespeare Company, and I nearly got a nice lead in a sitcom. While it was affirming that I was on the right path, there was also a feeling of never being quite enough. But I don’t resent it – that feeling is what pushed me towards standup comedy in the end.Once I discovered standup, I threw myself at it, because I wanted to get better. I loved Victoria Wood, so always assumed I would do character comedy, but I quickly realised that on stage, I had to be me. Or a cartoon version of me. One that’s slightly heightened, hyperbolic and nutty.It was very exciting when I got the email from Ricky Gervais about playing Hannah in Derek. It wasn’t the usual cattle-call that actors get, he just asked me: “Do you want to play this part?” I’ve always been too shy to ask him how he knew about me in the first place – but he loves standup, so he would have seen me on stage at some point, and I had sent in an audition tape for The Office. After Derek, he gave me a scene on Extras and Life’s Too Short. Then came After Life – which was mind‑blowing, because it blew up in lockdown when everyone was incubated. The show has since had a life of its own – even this week, someone came up to me and told me how important the show was to them. I feel very grateful to have been part of a bit of culture that creates intimate conversations between people about grief.I always loved comedians who talkedabout social stigmas, who made human foibles funny. I’m really glad that I’m able to do that with my own standup now. Particularly because I am in the midlife “fuck it” years, where you have limited bandwidth to hold everything together, so you’ve got to let some things go. There are times where I get a bit self-conscious because my standup material is so domestic – but that’s the landscape of my life. There’s always some drama with my knickers or some household frustration to laugh at. Given I am menopausal, there are a lot of emotions to unpick, too. Some days I feel as if I’m drowning, and other days I am blissed-out and feel these are the best years of my life. It’s very cathartic to let it all out in a room with a group of women I suspect are all on the same page.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I thought I’d never find my place in the world, or I’d never meet anyone special. I feel a lot less of that now, but naturally the odd bit of insecurity rises up at times. I’ve never met anyone who doesn’t feel like that. Although I did recently meet a man who said: “Hey, have you ever heard of impostor syndrome?” I was like: “Yeah, I think I’ve heard of that.” Mind you, Ricky is genuinely a fearless person. Has his fearlessness ever rubbed off on me? He has a different profile, he is an older bloke in a world that listens to older blokes. I think sometimes women have had to fight a little bit more for that stuff, but we’re getting there.When you have young kids,youdevote so much of your life to them, so when they suddenly leave and do their own thing, you have to ask yourself: “What should I do now?” At the moment, I am doing a lot of standup, which is great, but it can get a little lonely when you’re on tour. I’d like to do more theatre, too, and I still love acting, even if it’s unpredictable. I didn’t get a job that I really wanted the other day. It was humbling, but I’m definitely better at rolling with the punches than I used to be. I’ve had more experience, and I have faith that something else will come along. My daughter has now decided she wants to get into acting. I’m like: “I hope I haven’t failed my kids by showing them that it’s perfectly normal to have this precarious, up-and-down lifestyle!”As for big fancy house parties, I can’t remember the last time I went to one. My kids’ generation doesn’t seem to do them. Or maybe I’m just not invited!Explore more on these topicsKerry GodlimanFlashbackFamilyPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As such, a forgotten bit of Westminster ends up breaking away from the rest of the country and becoming its own self-governing micronation, with all the greed and pettiness that comes with it.

With the LSO on tremendous form, Pappano lets the music unfurl in a single unbroken arc of gathering tension from the slithery, lubricious clarinet solo with which it opens to the savagery of the ending, and every flicker of detail and colour in Strauss’s orchestration hits home. Strings sound palpably sensual, woodwind by turns exquisite and edgy, the brass associated with Jochanaan infinitely noble as it intrudes on the prevailing mood of feverish eroticism. The overall effect is of great beauty slowly turning monstrous, obscene, and rotten with decay.It’s sung with remarkable and consistent lyricism, avoiding the expressionistic-sprechstimme approach we sometimes find, and all the more powerful for it. The concerts finally allow us to hearAsmik Grigorianin the title role, a career-making assumption when she first sang it in Salzburg in 2018, but which she has not performed in the UK until now. The mixture of metal and silk in her tone allows her to soar comfortably and rapturously above Strauss’s orchestra both in her declarations of love to Michael Volle’s Jochanaan and in voicing the torrential emotions of the final scene. Elsewhere, the darkness in her lower registers conveys nerve-ridden ennui, steely determination and imperious selfishness. She is utterly compelling throughout.Volle, meanwhile, superbly captures the fanaticism that lurks behind Jochanaan’s principled dignity, is magnificent in his evocation of Christ preaching to his disciples on Lake Galilee, and ferocious as he heaps curses on Salome. Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke makes a suitably neurotic Herod: vapid, weak-willed, lethally dangerous, barely maintaining the veneer of elegance he tries to preserve before his dinner guests. His Herodias is Violeta Urmana, fierce in her scorn and well nigh brutal in her irony. John Findon sounds ardent, even heroic as Narraboth, his voice bigger than many we usually hear in the role, while Niamh O’Sullivan is eloquent and deeply touching as the Page.An outstanding, overpowering achievement, every second of it, and one of the greatest performances of Salome I’ve ever heard.Atthe Barbican, London, on 13 JulyExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicAntonio PappanoBarbicanLondon Symphony Orchestralive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Colley was a fan favourite at Star Wars conventions.Photograph: Lucas FilmsMoviesObituaryKenneth Colley obituaryActor known as Admiral Piett in the Star Wars movies, and for his many roles in the films of Ken RussellAnthony HaywardSun 13 Jul 2025 11.37 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Jul 2025 11.38 EDTShareKenneth Colley, who has died aged 87, after suffering from Covid and pneumonia, was a character actor widely admired by both the press and public for his screen roles over 60 years, from the Imperial officer Admiral Piett in two of the original Star Wars films and Jesus in Monty Python’s Life of Brian to historical figures such as Nelson and Napoleon, and two Adolfs, Hitler and Eichmann.He described his parts as “mad and bad”, while critics variously commented that the sad-eyed actor had “a defeated look if ever there was one” and he could “make your spine tingle with pleasure”.He is embedded in the minds of sci-fi film fans as Firmus Piett, a role he landed afterIrvin Kershner, director of The Empire Strikes Back (1980), the second in the first Star Wars trilogy, said he was “looking for someone that would frighten Hitler”. Piett was the commander of Executor, Darth Vader’s flagship super star destroyer employed in the Empire’s quest for galactic control.George Lucas, theStar Warscreator and producer, had not intended to feature an Imperial officer twice in the first trilogy, but Colley made the character of Piett human – “You can’t just play a uniform,” he said – and Star Wars fans wrote in demanding to see him again. So Lucas brought him back for Return of the Jedi (1983), adding scenes to the original script. But Colley’s run ended there, with Piett commanding the entire Imperial fleet at the Battle of Endor and perishing when a Rebel starfighter destroys the Executor’s command bridge. He remained a firm fan favourite at Star Wars conventions over the following decades.Colley also gained cult status as Jesus delivering the Sermon on the Mount in the 1979 film Monty Python’s Life of Brian. He had previously appeared with individual members of the Monty Python team in the movie Jabberwocky and on TV in Ripping Yarns (both in 1977).He was also much admired byKen Russelland was part of the flamboyant director’s unofficial repertory company for 22 years. Colley started as Hitler in Dance of the Seven Veils (1970), a BBC musical biopic that outraged Richard Strauss’s family with its sex scenes and depiction of the composer as a Nazi sympathiser.Then came film parts as Modest, Tchaikovsky’s younger brother, in The Music Lovers; Legrand in The Devils, brilliantly cinematic, but controversial – and censored – for its tale of a philandering 17th-century French Catholic priest, witchcraft, nudity and sexually repressed nuns; and a bearded king for a fantasy sequence in The Boy Friend (all 1971).In further Russell musical biopics, Colley was Krenek, a journalist posing challenging questions, in Mahler (1974) and Frédéric Chopin in Lisztomania (1975). He played the dour teacher Mr Brunt in Russell’s film version of The Rainbow (1989) before returning to TV as Alfred Dreyfus, a wrongly jailed 19th-century French officer, in Prisoner of Honor (1991) and the composer John Ireland in The Secret Life of Arnold Bax (1992).View image in fullscreenKenneth Colley as Hitler in Ken Russell’s Dance of the Seven Veils, 1970.Photograph: BBC/RGR Collection/AlamyColley was born in Manchester, to Jessie (nee Hughes) and Ernest Colley, a labourer. When he was 14, a teacher at South Hulme secondary modern school asked him about his career ambitions, and he said he wanted to act. On leaving school, he went through jobs as a commercial art assistant, bus conductor and warehouse operative, but his dream never faded. “One day, I told myself that I was 23 and I had to stop wasting my time,” Colley recalled. In 1961, he headed for London and knocked on theatrical agents’ doors, but failed to impress.Nevertheless, he landed his first theatre job as an assistant stage manager with Bromley repertory company, where he started acting. He also made his screen debut, as a corpse, in the BBC sci-fi series A for Andromeda (1961) in the middle of an actors’ strike that meant most Equity members were not available for work.Moving on, he joined the newly formed Living Theatre company in an old school building in Leicester (1961-63), alongside actors such asJill Gascoine. His performance as Jimmy Porter in John Osborne’s anti-establishment play Look Back in Anger led one critic to write: “Kenneth Colley burns with sardonic rage.”While television quickly recognised his talents as a character actor, with appearances in dramas such as The Avengers (1963), as well as the role of a fellow steel worker playing pranks on Dennis Tanner in Coronation Street (1964), Colley continued on stage with the company at the Unity, a London East End venue with roots in the workers’ theatre movement.He played Wick there in another ”angry young man” play, Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs (1965), written byDavid Halliwelland directed by Mike Leigh. He reprised the role at that year’s Dublin theatre festival and in the West End of London the following year at the Garrick, before taking small parts with the National Theatre company at the Old Vic in 1968.View image in fullscreenKenneth Colley, left, with Bob Hoskins in the BBC’s Pennies from Heaven, 1978.Photograph: Radio Times/Getty ImagesLater stage roles included Cleet in Cromwell (Royal Court, 1973) and Benedick on tour with theRoyal Shakespeare Companyin Much Ado About Nothing (1979). In films, he played Michael Crawford’s chauffeur in The Jokers (1967) and a Soviet colonel in Firefox (1982), alongside Clint Eastwood.He first played Hitler on television in Jean Benedetti’s BBC play These Men Are Dangerous (1969). His other small-screen parts included Charles I in Revolution: Cromwell (1970), the “accordion man” in Pennies from Heaven (1978), an SS officer in the 1983 TV movie The Scarlet and the Black, starringGregory Peck, Eichmann in Wallenberg: A Hero’s Story (1985), and the title roles in I Remember Nelson (1982) and Napoleon’s Last Battle (1990).Colley also gave a standout performance as the manipulating Duke of Vienna in the 1979 BBC Shakespeare production Measure for Measure and enjoyed a starring role as Ken Uttley, owner of a removals firm, in the comedy-drama Moving Story (1994-95). In 2016, he played the doomed mob boss Vicente Changretta in Peaky Blinders.In 1962, Colley married Mary Dunne; she died in 2018.Kenneth Colley, actor, born 7 December 1937; died 30 June 2025Explore more on these topicsFilmStar WarsStar Wars: The Empire Strikes BackKen RussellMonty PythonTelevisionRoyal Shakespeare CompanyobituariesShareReuse this content"

Many of them receive alcohol and chocolates on repeat, but from plants and tote bags to flying lessons (yes, really), here’s what they might actually like to receive.The best gifts for teachersHandwritten cardsMany teachers we spoke to said cards were the most memorable thing they’ve received over the years (and it’s worth taking the time to get your kids involved to make something homemade). Sam, a senior school English teacher in Essex, says: “They’re the things I keep and look back at. I have a photo album I keep them all in, but some are also up on my board at work.”“I work in a deprived area and some of the most meaningful gifts I’ve received are the handwritten cards from my pupils,” agrees Steph, a primary school teacher in Yorkshire. “I keep every single one in a scrapbook. There’s no need to spend money when a thoughtful note means so much more.”View image in fullscreenTraditional photo album£30 at John LewisView image in fullscreenLinen effect pin board£15 at DunelmView image in fullscreenPaperchase notecard and envelope set£10 at TescoView image in fullscreenLetter-writing set£7.19 at Temptation Gifts£12.49 at AmazonArts and craftsLogic may suggest teachers are ready for a break from kids’ craft projects, but this isn’t what we heard.“One of the best presents I’ve received was a tote bag, where the children wrote messages, drew pictures or signed their names,” says Jill, a retired primary school teacher from south London.Meanwhile, Claire*, an Oxford-based biology teacher, told us: “A student painted a mug with a drawing of me and all the things I had told them I loved, which was very sweet.” Others, including Dawn, a retired primary school teacher from Hertfordshire, prize their pupils’ art. “One of the nicest gifts I received was a framed drawing that a child had done,” she says.View image in fullscreenLarge fabric tote bag to decorate£6.95 for three at Baker RossView image in fullscreenDIY mug£7 at Flying TigerView image in fullscreenClip frame£3 at HobbycraftFrom £4.39 at FramesPersonalised presentsFrom handbags to bookmarks, personalised gifts were favourites among the teachers we spoke with. “I once received a bookmark with my name on it – I love it,” says Lisa,a primary school teacher from Cardiff. “For me, the more personal the better,” says Karen, a teacher from Manchester. “Favourites have included a gorgeous copy of my favourite book, and framed prints related to our class texts.”Primary school teacher Rob* was once given a Lego Superman keyring with his name engraved on the cape: “The best gift I ever received,” he says.View image in fullscreenPersonalised antiqued leather bookmark£14 at Not on the High Street£14 at EtsyView image in fullscreenPersonalised Ashley tote bag£39.99 at Katie LoxtonView image in fullscreenPersonalisedLego figuresFrom £13 at Byron BricksView image in fullscreenPersonalised stationeryFrom £21 at PapierJoint presentsA whole-class gift can seem like a cop-out, but they’re universally well-received, says Rob. “The best present – the one I think every teacher actually wants to receive – is the clubbed-together gift. So, instead of 20 mugs and some chocolates, you get a single gift worth a lot more. For me, that was vouchers, but friends have received coffee machines and even an iPad.”Jill agrees: “Vouchers from the whole class have been fantastic because they’ve enabled me to buy things I wouldn’t normally get for myself, such as pieces of jewellery or perfume.”Look out for bargains. “At my daughter’s primary school, we bought a Champneys voucher for her teacher when they were offering an extra 30% credit,” says Essex senior school teacher Louise.But they don’thaveto be big-ticket items. Several teachers were thrilled with coffee-shop vouchers.

Meanwhile, Sean tops the lot, saying: “A parent of a child in my class was training to be a pilot, so they presented me with a flying lesson. I ended up flying a four-seater plane alongside the dad with the child in the back.”View image in fullscreenFlying lesson£169 at Red Letter Days£175.05 at Virgin Experience DaysPlantsHorticultural gifts are a rich area for ideas. Sue, a retired Hertfordshire teacher, was once given the aptly named school girl rose. And SEN lead Jackie says one of her favourite presents was a fern for her garden. “It reminds me of the boy and his family that I supported over the years. There was a gift tag saying: ‘Thank you for helping our son grow.’ I’ve had lots of vouchers and wine over the years, but the presents the children make or choose themselves mean the most.”And teacher Angie Bonnel wrote to the Filter to tell us the best gift she ever received: a pilea (or Chinese money) plant. “Since then, I must have given away at least 30 of its offspring and still have at least 10 thriving plants in my house. It was such a thoughtful gift that has also given pleasure to many others,” she says.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Peter Fleming/Getty ImagesSchool girl rose£17.95 at Gardening ExpressView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Ahrens/AlamySensitive fernFrom £5 at CrocusFrom £5.99 at WaitroseView image in fullscreenPilea plantFrom £9.99 at Thompson & MorganFrom £14.99 at CrocusView image in fullscreenPersonalised teacher plant potFrom £28 at Not on the High Street£32 at LetterfestLean into the summer holsWhile the summer holidays can be a challenging time for parents, for teachers it represents a well-earned rest – and a great source of gift ideas.

The British, on the other hand, have always been rather less keen, so it was surprising to hear reports thatLapin, a new French restaurant in Bristol, had been struggling to keep fluffy bunnies on its classic, single-sheet menu due to supply reasons, apparently because its game dealer couldn’t shoot them quickly enough to meet Lapin’s demand. Instead, its diners had had to settle for confit duck leg, coarse sausage and deep-fried pig’s head.Lapin patently aims to offer actual French cooking, albeit stopping short of the likes of pungentandouillette, complete with its tubey innards escaping on to the plate. That said, I’d bet that chefJack Briggs-Horanand restaurateurDan O’Regantinkered with the idea before accepting that serving something quite so smelly in a small, repurposed shipping container was probably one Gallic step too far. I’vementionedBristol’s love of delis and dining spots in former shipping containers before, and here we are again at Lapin, gasping at how, with a little imagination and clever sleight of hand, you can turn an impersonal iron box into a tiny slice of France. The walls are painted a calm, elegant sage-green, there’s a dinky little drinks trolley and aprix-fixemenu up on the wall – £29 for three courses – all whileFrance Gall coos Ella, Elle l’acoquettishly over the speakers.View image in fullscreen‘Who can resist?’: Lapin’s asparagus with sauce gribiche and beurre noisette.I went with Charles, my longsuffering sidekick and a man of French stock, and watched as, after a short debate in French about the booze-free aperitif offering, the French server ended up bringing him a bright green glass ofsweet, minty diabolo, which is the taste of Charles’ childhood. “OK,” I thought to myself, “you guys are good at this stuff. We’re not in Cafe Rouge now.”As we waited for some cheese-stacked comté gougeres with custardy insides and baguette with a mountain of whipped cod’s roe, it dawned on me that, although rabbit didn’t feature among the entrees that day (there’s usually some rillettes), there were tiny, subtle rabbit motifs on the tableware, the servers’ jackets, the wine list and the table. To me, these understated Donnie Darko touches were a delight.View image in fullscreen‘Crisp, hot, generous’: Lapin’s chicken schnitzel with oyster mushroom, chicken wing and madeira jus.Would I recommend Lapin? On the whole, yes, because this is a menu that could thaw the iciest of hearts. Who can resist chunky asparagus with sauce gribiche and beurre noisette, or a very good, fluffily light, but rich-with-gruyère souffle Suissesse? Both were charming to look at and to eat. I erred, however, by ordering the chicken schnitzel with madeira jus, because, although it was crisp, hot, generous and came with an oyster mushroom and a chicken wing, it was a little one-note – that note being “fried” – unlike the colourful Provençal fish stew filled with mullet, prawns and mussels I saw being delivered to other tables.Lapin’s menu might even trip you up. Take the gnocchi Parisienne: if you’d ordered it expecting a sedate plate of Italian-style potato bullets, then buckle up: these gnocchi mean business, because these are plump, fluffy, choux pastry parcels in a stew of braised courgette, mint and creme fraiche. They were also that day’s sole vegetarian main-course option, which was possibly the least French part of the meal, because the French feel about vegetarians roughly the same as Queen Victoriaallegedlydid about lesbians: they’ve vaguely heard of the concept, but don’t fully believe they really exist. Rather boldly, Lapin also offers to add a 5g spoon of caviar or a scoop ofRollright cheeseto any dish for an extra cost (£13 and £7, respectively), which is a nifty little way of turning even the most saintly dish into some arch you-time.View image in fullscreenThe ‘rich’St Émilion au chocolat, at Lapin, Bristol.We skipped the part of the menu markedtrou normand, offering a traditional palate-cleansing glass of apple cider brandy with apple sorbet for £8, and sailed headlong into desserts, where Basque cheesecake sits side by side with theéclair du jour, which on this occasion was lemon meringue;pain perdu, that rib-sticking classic, was also on offer, served with vanilla ice-cream and apple. An almost impossible decision, and one complicated further by aSt Émilion au chocolatin which the rich chocolate cream met crushed amaretti biscuits soaked in sherry.Lapin is a peculiar, meta, slightly earnest, definitely delicious French restaurant that you would never, ever find in France – not least because no one in France would be seen dead eating in an old metal box. But Bristolians are lucky to have it. It’s only early days, and they’re still finding their feet, but mange tout, Rodders, mange tout.LapinUnit 14, Cargo 2, Museum Street, Bristol BS1, 0117-408 4997.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.When I visited Hanoi a decade ago, I was living in Hackney, east London, an area with a large Vietnamese community, so I felt, if not quite an expert, at least a little familiar with the cuisine. But it turned out no number of nights out on Kingsland Road could prepare me for the assault on the senses that was my first meal in the city, crouched on a plastic stool by the roadside and enjoying what Uyen Luu describes as “the irresistible sweet, treacly smell of barbecued patties and caramelised pork”, all mingled with traffic fumes.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The stall in question served one thing only:bún chả, a northern speciality of juicy chargrilled pork, cold, slippery rice noodles, sweet yet deeply savourynước chấmdipping sauce and fistfuls of aromatic herbs. “About as typical and unique a Hanoi dish as there is,”as Anthony Bourdainexplained to Barack Obamaover bowls of the stuff in 2016, there’s something about the way you can pick and mix the different elements to make every bite unique that makes this pure joy to eat.View image in fullscreenFelicity’s prototype perfect bun cha. All thumbnail photographs by Felicity Cloake.Chef and restaurateurBobby Chinndescribes bún chả as “a great example of the art of Vietnamese grilling”, and says it’s made with either “thin strips of pork belly grilled until the meat is slightly crisp and smoky, or as little burgers. I generally prefer the latter, because these burgers are quite unique.” Very often the two options are served together, as inUyen LuuandVy Tran’srecipes, in which pork belly slices are marinated in a mixture of fish sauce, sugar, garlic, shallots and black pepper for several hours before grilling (Tran freezes the meat for 45 minutes or so to facilitate cutting, though a butcher should be able to save you the trouble). Delicious as they are, I’m inclined to agree with Chinn that the pork patties are the real crowdpleasers, so they will be the stars of my recipe, too (if you’d like the whole shooting match, by all means replace half the pork mince with thin strips of skinless pork belly, and divide the marinade between the two).As almost everyone notes, this dish needs to be made with fairly fatty meat, “which helps it”, Chinn says, “retain incredible moisture, simultaneously allowing the fat to melt, sweating the meat with drips of fat into the fire allows for a more smoky flavour”. A minimum of 20% fat is ideal; my butcher makes it with shoulder, which seems to work as well as the belly specified by some writers.View image in fullscreenUyen Luu’s bun cha displays ‘the irresistible sweet, treacly smell of barbecued patties and caramelised pork’.Given the full-flavoured dipping sauce with which the patties are served, my testers prefer those that aren’t loaded with sugar or salty soy or oyster sauce. Luu’s book Vietnam, and Chinn’s Vietnamese Food both start with a caramel sauce, the latter using palm sugar heated until it begins to smoke for a dark, complex sweetness. Though I’m sure he’s right that this is “the one additive that should never be omitted”, in practice, my testers prefer the more savoury, porky patties, which I’m relieved about, because mixing hot sugar syrup and cold pork is more difficult than it sounds. As a nod to those caramel sauces, however (an ingredient I do love inrecipes such asred boat pork belly), I’ve gone for food writerVicky Pham’s brown variety, which, she says “helps to caramelise and char the pork patties and provide a sweet sticky glaze when grilled”. It’s all balanced with a dash of fish sauce; for extra savouriness, you could also pop in a pinch of MSG or powdered stock, as Luu suggests.View image in fullscreenVicky Pham’s bun cha ‘is the only recipe I find that features lemongrass’.I also really like Pham’s chopped lemongrass, but as hers is the only recipe I find that features it (lemongrass is, I’m reliably informed, more common in the cooking of the south), I’ve left it out. Chopped shallots are fairly standard, however (if you go to a specialist supermarket for the herbs and noodles, see if they have small red Asian shallots, which are both more fiddly and more pungent than their larger European counterparts), while Luke Nguyen also adds garlic, chives and spring onion, though finely chopped garlic is more common.The only spice in any of the recipes I try is freshly ground black pepper, but two recipes, from Pham’s website and Nguyen’s book The Songs of Sapa (another extraordinarily beautiful place) use roasted rice powder and beaten egg to bind the patties. I don’t have a problem with them falling apart once the meat has been chilled to firm up, though, so I wouldn’t bother.(Non pork-eating readers could substitute minced turkey or chicken, though their lower fat content means you will probably need to add beaten egg; or trya plant-based versionand report back.)The cookingView image in fullscreenLuke Nguyen adds garlic, chives and spring onion to his pork patty mix.Although the larger patties preferred by Luu and Tran remain juicier during cooking, my testers prefer the convenience and smokier flavour of the bite-sized ones in other recipes, especially when they’ve been cooked on a barbecue. Not that this is the only option: following alternative suggestions from the recipes, I try them, in order of preference: baked (which works, as would an air fryer, though I’d flash them under a hot grill at the end to try to achieve a bit of charring), a frying pan, an overhead grill and, the second best option to getting out the charcoal, a hot griddle pan. As if reading my mind, Tran writes on Serious Eats that, “while it might be convenient to cook the pork in a stovetop grill pan, the result will lack the smoky flavour and char essential to bún chả.” While undeniably true, I promise that either way the results will be so delicious that you’re unlikely to be wracked with regret. (Note, if you do go down the barbecue route, a fish cage will make turning the meatballs easier.)The dipping sauceAccording to Pham, “while the pork is integral to bún chả, it’s the dipping sauce (nước chấm) that makes or breaks the meal”, because it helps bring together the disparate parts into one unified whole. Tran offers a useful guide for novices: “To eat bún chả, taste the dipping sauce first before adding other condiments or accompaniments such as raw garlic or sliced bird’s eye chilli … Add fresh herbs to the bowl and throw a small heap of vermicelli noodles in the dipping sauce. Take your chopsticks and pick up the noodles along with meat, pickled vegetables and fresh herbs.”Nước chấm is based on fish sauce, preferably atraditionally fermented Vietnamese versionthat tends to be less harshly salty than cheaper cooking varieties, and sugar. Pham, who is based in California, also uses a Puerto Rican brand of coconut soda in hers, which is tough to track down in the UK, so I substitute coconut water – but, in the end, most of my testers prefer the punchier, zestier notes of sauces that feature more lime juice and rice vinegar than coconut sweetness. (Vinegar is often provided on the table along with sliced garlic and bird’s eye chilli, so you can adjust to taste.)View image in fullscreenBobby Chinn’s bun cha: ‘Pork patties are real crowdpleasers.’Interestingly, opinions vary as to the desirable temperature of said sauce; Luu, Chinn and Pham serve it at room temperature, and Nguyen and Tran steaming hot, with the latter writing approvingly that atBún Chả Đắc Kimin Hanoi, “the dipping sauce was boiling when the cook ladled it into the bowl containing the meat. Given how fatty the patties and pork slices are, the high temperature prevents fat droplets from coagulating at the top”. According to Mervin Lee of the Michelin Guide Vietnam,it’s a weather thing:“The broth is served cool in summer for a refreshing contrast to the smoky pork and gently warmed in winter, infusing each bite with comforting heat”. In other words, it’s up to you.The pickles and vegetablesNot all the recipes I try include pickled vegetables, but I’m a fan: the vinegar cuts through the fattiness of the pork, while the vegetables themselves add yet another texture and flavour to the party. Green papaya (which you’ll probably need to go to an south-east Asian grocers for) is, I think, the ideal, but as crunch is the point here, thinly sliced carrot, kohlrabi and radish also work well. (If you don’t have time for pickling, Pham’s slices of cucumber or Nguyen’s beansprouts make fine substitutes.)Lettuce leaves are also a nice touch, but the essential thing to finish this dish are herbs – and in quantity. Thoughfish mint and Vietnamese corianderprove elusive even in central London, Thai basil is becoming much easier to find, and perilla (shiso) is increasingly available, too. If you don’t have the luxury of specialists nearby, however, rest assured that the important thing is the punch of aromatics that fresh herbs deliver, so a fistful of fresh coriander and mint will do much the same job.The noodlesView image in fullscreenVy Tran’s bun cha: ‘The smoky flavour and char is essential.’Very little dissent here: rice vermicelli is the move on the bún chả front, though Pham specifies medium-sized round rice noodles (which I misread and end up with medium-size flat rice ones, instead. Worse things happen at sea, as my grandma would say, had she ever had a rice noodle). The noodles are served cold, so you can prepare them, like almost all the elements of this dish, in advance, making it an excellent choice for a relaxed barbecue party.Perfect bún chảPrep30 minChill15 min+Pickle2 hrCook8 minServes4For the patties400g pork mince– not too lean, ideally2 tbsp fish sauce2 tbsp finely chopped shallots4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed1 tsp soft brown sugar1½ tsp coarsely ground black pepperSaltOil, for greasing the griddle or grill bars, and your handsFor the pickles200g carrot, radish (eg, daikon), kohlrabi and/or green papaya2 tbsp rice vinegar20g sugar¼ tsp fine saltFor the dipping sauce150ml fish sauce150ml rice vinegar100g sugarJuice of 5 limesTo serve300g rice vermicelli1 small head of lettuce1 generous handfulmixed fresh herbs– perilla, Thai basil, mint, coriander4 bird’s eye chilli, thinly sliced4 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly slicedView image in fullscreenPut all the ingredients for the patties bar the oil in a large bowl, mix well, then use greased hands to tear off small pieces and roll into bite-sized meatballs.

Just an hour north of Bratislava by train, the town and its spa-populated island are packed with grand art nouveau and art deco buildings.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.There’s a faint aroma of sulphur in the air as Igor paces ahead, past peacocks and ponds full of lilies, imparting his home town’s history. The hot water that springs from beneath the island sandbank has created what we’re all here for: a blueish medicinal mud that’s rich in hydrogen sulphide and sulphur.View image in fullscreenIllustration: GraphicsSlovakia is gaining an international reputation for its affordable and high-quality spa treatments. I’m here to visit three of its leading spa towns, travelling entirely by rail. The journey from London is straightforward and took less than 24 hours thanks to the new European Sleeper route that leaves Brussels for Prague three nights a week, and a direct train from Prague to Piešťany.On checking in at the Thermia Palace, the history of this grand 113-year-old hotel and neighbouring Irma Health Spa is immediately apparent. Photographs of maharajas, politicians and singers who have visited are on display, and a painting donated by Alfonse Mucha, the Czech artist whose work defined the art nouveau style, hangs in the hotel’s dining room. His daughter came here regularly for the balneotherapy (mineral-water hydrotherapy), and there is a small museum on Spa Island dedicated to his work.View image in fullscreenMud is prescribed for reducing swelling and inflammationI’m assigned to Dr Alena Korenčíková, who immediately notices I have hypermobility and draws up a personalised programme that includes visits to the thermal bath, filled with sulphuric mineral water, and the hot-mud pool. I’m also prescribed daily CO2 injections. Known as carboxytherapy, this treatment is meant to help muscle recovery and tissue regeneration; my rock-hard shoulders feel noticeably looser afterwards. And finally, I’m prescribed a mud-pack treatment, which is recommended for reducing swelling and inflammation, and nourishing the joints. When I explain that I’m going to Trenčianske Teplice and hope to continue mud treatment there, Dr Alena says: “They have peat, it’s not the same as ours.” Time to fine-tune my mud knowledge.The building is as thrilling as the bathing. Piešťany is just as much about the architecture as the watersAs I submerge myself in the warm cloudy water, my toes squish into the mineral mud that is pumped directly from the mud kitchen (where it’s treated) into the vast circular pool. The building is as thrilling as the bathing. The 19th-century dome above the pool is the spa’s stunning centrepiece, with stained glass art deco skylight windows sitting high up on the art nouveau walls decorated with tiles, floral motifs and cherubs. Piešťany is just as much about architecture as about bathing, it seems.Local architect Eva Rohoňová cements this theory the following day, when she shows me around the extraordinary House of Arts, a colossal piece of 1970s brutalism that houses the town’s concert hall and cultural centre. “It’s far too big a capacity for just people from Piešťany,” she says. “The Czechoslovakian government built it here as the town was full of international visitors. It was to demonstrate the culture.” She has been giving tours of otherwise inaccessible interior spaces to locals over the years, but anyone can arrange one through theVisit Piešťany website.View image in fullscreenThe Sina hammam was designed in the 1880s by an expert on Islamic architecture and decorative artsAfter three mud-packed days, I take a train north to Trenčianske Teplice just outside Trenčín, one of next year’s European Capitals of Culture. I’m instantly taken by the picturesque spa town with its mix of baby pink and peachy orange 19th-century guesthouses and angular 1960s concrete hotels. Daniel Oriešek from the tourist board shows me around. I point out the steady stream of visitors carrying walking poles. “It’s not the Tatras, but people come here for hiking,” he says, alluding to Slovakia’s West Carpathian range which forms a scenic backdrop to the town.The sauna master swirls around splashing orange, lemongrass and yuzu water over the hot coals as pop songs blast out and everyone claps alongThey also come to bathe at the Sina hammam, an ornate Turkish bathhouse that looks as though it could have been teleported here from Istanbul. It was in fact built in 1888 and designed by František Schmoranz Jr, an Austrian architect of Czech origin who had spent several years living in Egypt and was a leading expert on Islamic architecture and decorative arts.I’m ushered in and shown to the pool, where an unexpected delight greets me: a huge socialist-era mural that covers one entire wall. I soak in the water and copy the locals, who splash their faces with water from the source in the middle of the pool. Afterwards, my skin looks and feels fantastic and, with an entry price of just £12.50, I’m already plotting my next visit as I exit the building.View image in fullscreenThe pastel coloured market square of Zilina.Photograph: Marc Venema/AlamyThe next day I catch a train to Žilina, a city in the north of the country, where I disembark to hop on a bus for Rajecké Teplice. It’s a village compared with Piešťany and only has the one spa, Aphrodite, but that spa is truly unlike anywhere else I’ve been. Lovingly maximalist, with Roman-style columns, mosaics and gold decor that glimmers in the crisp spring sunshine, this is the Vegas of spa resorts. “When you are lying on a sunbed on a hot summer day and take a cold dip in the pool, it’s like you’re not in Slovakia,” says staff member Radka Capkova. “Everyone knows Slovakia has lots of spas, but it’s usually older people who want to go. But our spa is so famous that we get younger people here taking photos.”It’s a huge complex of 11 saunas, three restaurants, an outdoor swimming pool and Nature Land, where bathing is naked after 5pm. I feel far too British for this, but wearing a bikini to a sauna is a firm no in central Europe, so I collect a sauna sheet and tuck it around myself like a sarong. Capkova encourages me to attend one of their “sauna ritual” events (orAufguss) and get over the nudity: “No one stares or looks,” he says.40 best spa breaks in the UKRead moreI go to the hottest ritual, where the sauna master swirls around like a figure skater, splashing orange, lemongrass and yuzu water over the hot coals as pop songs blast out and everyone claps along – the camaraderie is so infectious that I quickly forget everyone is naked.“My great-great-grandmother, my great-aunt, my mother, everyone worked here at some point,” Capkova tells me. Rajecké Teplice is the smallest of the spa towns I’ve been to, but it has a big community impact. Spas are just in the blood in Slovakia. “But in the UK you don’t go to the spa?” It’s a question I get asked a lot throughout this week. “We’re working on it,” I always reply.The trip was provided byVisit Piešťany,Trenčianske Teplice Regional Tourism, Spa AphroditeandByway Travel (byway.travel).

But Bubbe, Punk, Plug, Buffy, Gelato and the rest can’t imagine life without theirsGuardian readersSun 13 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Jul 2025 11.05 EDTShareNicknames are dying out,according to the Wall Street Journal, thanks to a fear of causing offence or sounding unprofessional. But they’re not dead yet. We asked readers to tell us theirs, where they came from and how they feel about them.‘The name Weeb made me feel loved’My foster father gave me the nickname Weeb around 1995 – way before it meant someone who enjoys Japanese culture – because I have very thick, dark hair and, at that point, I was in my gawky teens. I fell over a lot. He said I looked like tumbleweed stumbling into rooms, then it became Weeb because of the “b” in Phoebe. I’ve always loved it; it is one of many things my foster parents did, and still do, to make me feel loved and at home. I do have to keep explaining that I’m not particularly intoanimeto my 14-year-old’s friends, though!Phoebe Pallotti, independent midwife, Sheffield‘To my girlfriend, I’m always Pine Cone’I’m Pine Cone – at least according to my girlfriend. It came about not long after we started spending time together. I was getting frustrated by a video game and she said: “Have patience, young Pine Cone.” It turned out she had recently seen a meme of a pangolin being asked, “Little pine cone, why do you drink?”, to which the pangolin replied, “To forget”, while slurping water with its long tongue. I don’t drink by licking, I rarely touch alcohol and I’m not particularly pine-cone-shaped, but it kind of stuck because of the absurdity. My girlfriend is the only one who calls me Pine Cone, but I don’t remember the last time she called me anything else.Pine Cone, software developer, LondonView image in fullscreenRobert Balcer, AKA Magic Pockets.Photograph: Handout‘Magic Pockets makes it sound like I’m lucky’Through my teenage years, my nickname was Magic Pockets, as I always seemed to be the guy who had the right change, a working pen, a lighter, an important phone number … Sadly, the powers are now gone. I kind of liked the expression, as it sounded as if I was lucky, which has turned out to be mostly true.Robert Balcer, part-time teacher, Chiang Rai, Thailand‘Grandma called me Jojo’My given name is not easily shortened, but my Slovak-speaking grandma would call me Jojo. I never thought much about it until she died: I surprised myself by crying, knowing no one would call me Jojo again. That’s when I became Jojo in my own self-talk. My officemates laugh when they hear me whisper “C’mon, Jojo!” to myself.Joel Neubauer, Lutheran pastor, Virginia, US‘Kids called me Plug’I was called Plug, which might have been related to the character of the same name from the Bash Street Kids inthe Beano, but I claim it was derived from the playing field adjacent to our house, where there was a broad selection of playground equipment. The roundabout was a favourite. It was divided into six segments and each of the neighbourhood children would claim ownership of a particular segment. Mine was the one that had the hole for lubricating the roundabout and it was sealed with a metal plug, hence my nickname. I accepted it quite happily.Anonymous, the Netherlands‘When I hear someone call “Hi, Gelato!”, I absolutely love it’I’m from London and after living in Italy for many years decided to move to Sri Lanka. Being a gelato chef, I opened a gelateria and named itLove Gelato. Local people often asked me what “gelato” meant and I would explain the Italian meaning, but for some reason to this day I have not been able to get my explanation through – and I have become known as Gelato. When I’m out in the village where I live and I hear someone call, “Hi Gelato!” I absolutely love it. I feel that I’ve made it in this life.Oz Qadir, Unawatuna, Sri LankaView image in fullscreenSafar Yusuf, AKA Master Shifu.Photograph: Handout‘I was short growing up, so I’m Master Shifu’Growing up, most of my friends had older brothers and apparently I was especially short compared with them. Someone mentioned that I was likeMaster Shifu from the Kung Fu Pandamovies and the nickname stuck – it’s still used more than my real name. Master Shifu was wise and all-powerful, so I embrace it.Safar Yusuf, postgraduate student, Glasgow‘I’m Chicken – or Chickenella’One night, when we had been dating for about two years, I woke to find my husband sniffing me, saying I smelled like a little chicken. He laughed, then rolled over and fell back to sleep. In the morning I reminded him of this and he had no memory of doing it. From then on I’ve been Chicken. The story still amuses people, so it’s stuck. In the past few years, it’s become Chickenella.Jan, graphic designer, Hammersmith‘Bradley Walsh turned me into the Force’My nickname is The Force, and it’s all because of Bradley Walsh. In January 2021, I was onThe Chase, and when asked what I would do if I won the prize, I answered that I’d take a career break and train as a professional wrestler. When Bradley asked what my wrestler nickname would be, I said: “The Force of Nature”. After my cash builder round, Bradley went backstage with a grin on his face and a producer returned to ask if they could change my name plate for the show from “Aidan” to “Force”. I thought this was a really great idea, something a bit different, and the nickname has completely stuck.Aidan Jones, resource coordinator, North Yorkshire‘I’m Buffy – like the queen mother’My nickname is Buffy. I read somewhere that it was also the nickname of the queen mother, so I’m in good company. My mother used to keep diaries and I read an entry saying, “Buffy is one!” – so it goes back that far. But I don’t know exactly how it originated. My father was a fan of the American singerBuffy Sainte-Marie, so one theory is that it originated from that; someone else suggested it came from being “in the buff” (naked).Caroline Jane Smith, recruiter, The Hague, the Netherlands‘I’ve been Punk since the 70s’In primary school in Scotland, during the early 70s, I was given the nickname Punk. This was derived from the children’s game Ker Plunk, a play on my surname. When punk rock finally made its way to Scotland in the 70s, the nickname became very fitting as I fully embraced the ethos of punk, which has stayed with me throughout my life. I’m still referred to as Punk by old schoolfriends, and I use the name as a pseudonym when posting pictures of meals I’ve cooked on social media, where I call myself Punk Floyd, which combines me (Punk) and Floyd (Keith, the late celebrity chef).James Kerr, retiree, HuntingdonView image in fullscreenAlex, AKA Bubbe.Photograph: Handout‘I’m Bubbe – Yiddish for grandmother’During my undergraduate years, I was given the nickname Bubbe, the Yiddish word for grandmother. Apparently, I gave off powerful enough grand-maternal vibes for it to stick for more than a decade. To be honest, I loved it and still do. Bubbe is a sweet word with lovely connotations – my imagination conjures an image of a woman who fiercely loves her bubeles, with a whipcrack wit and a pot of soup on the stove. Still, it confused some people, as I was, and remain, a balding man without grandchildren.Alex, college administrator, New York, US‘I get confused when I’m not called Pod’My nickname is Podnil, or Pod, which derives from my surname (Lindop) backwards. I began using it in secondary school. When I began teaching in Spain, some people knew me as Pod, but newcomers were introduced to me as Chris. When my now husband arrived and began teaching, he kept hearing about this other teacher called Pod. Who was Pod and when would he meet them, he wondered. It was some weeks before he realised Chris and Pod were the same person. Recently, I spent a few days in hospital and was always addressed as Christine. I found that quite startling.Christine Lindop, retired writer and editor, Bristol‘I’ve been Rags since I was 16’My nickname is Rags. It originated when I was 16: my friends and I were at a loose end on the night of our Intercert results – the state exams in Ireland. There was not much on offer as a distraction in our North Kerry town, but the local cinema was showingThe Exorcistand age limits were not really enforced, so we got in. The name of the young female character was Regan, my surname; her nickname was Rags. It stuck to me like glue since that night in 1980 and I love it. It is very much part of my personal story and many people only know me as Rags. I still get a thrill when I get a letter addressed to Rags or a table setting has just the name Rags at an event.Catherine Regan, semi-retired lawyer, north Wales and North KerryView image in fullscreenAlasdair Allan, AKA Babs.Photograph: Handout‘I feel a bit daft being a 45-year-old man called Babs’When I was about 16, a mate started calling me Ali Baba, which became Babs. Soon all my mates were calling me Babs and by the time I left school no one called me anything else. When I met new people I’d always introduce myself by my real name, but among schoolfriends I was always Babs. I tried to shake it but it seemed unnatural when my close pals called me Alasdair. I’m now teaching the kids of people I was at school with, and sometimes they say: “My dad says you get called Babs!” Sometimes I feel a bit daft being a 45-year-old man called Babs, but I’ve made my peace with it.Alasdair Allan, teacher,Helensburgh, Scotland‘Mum made me Chiffonette’My nickname as a child was Chiffonette. My French mother was always upset about the state of my clothes when I came home from playing outdoors. She thought they looked like “chiffons”, meaning rags, and so she started calling me Chiffonette, and that is how I was known in my street. I didn’t mind my nickname: it really described my appearance and I now associate it with the fun I had playing outdoors without giving a thought to the state of my clothes.Alexandra Lavizzari, Somerset‘Zachary turned into Zacharooney, then Rooney’My stepdad has called me Rooney for as long as I remember. It isn’t after Wayne Rooney, even though I did play football when I was younger, and he has no idea how it started. I suspect it came from Zachary (my full first name), which became Zacharooney, then just Rooney. But truth be told, I have no idea. I like it – no one else calls me that, so it’s a unique thing between us.Zach Wheelhouse Steel, social media manager,Badminton, GloucestershireView image in fullscreenPatsy McGill, AKA Bits.Photograph: Handout‘“Bits” gives me a warm glow of childhood’My nickname is Bits – coined by our former neighbour’s son. It was about 50 years ago and he’d come around for tea. He was fascinated by the fact such a tiny child loved cabbage and wanted to finish the unwanted, overcooked green mush. As he saw me eagerly scoop up his leftovers, he said I liked to eat the “bits”. From then on it became my nickname, adopted by my seven older brothers and sisters. I love it. It’s morphed over time to Bitsy or Bitties, but Bits gives me the warmest glow of childhood: I was good at something – eating my dear, frazzled Irish mum’s cabbage. Precious.Patsy McGill, psychotherapist, Derbyshire‘My ex called me Minkie; I call him Monkey’My former partner and I used to pet sit together and we came across an advert for a whippet named Minkie. One day soon after, I called him using what I imagined Minkie’s voice would sound like, if she could talk. I left a message, which my ex-partner thought was hilarious. Every now and then, Minkie would make another call to him. He started calling me Minkie and the name stuck. I now call him Monkey.Anonymous, Norfolk‘I love “Jelly” – it’s who I am’When I was born, my parents nicknamed me Jelly – apparently because I wiggled in my crib like a little jelly bean – and it stuck. I’m really not an Ange and definitely not an Angel. I’ve always been Jelly to my friends, to my teachers throughout school, to my students, to my colleagues and strangers. I love it – it’s who I am.Angelica Hill, linguist, AmsterdamExplore more on these topicsLife and stylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Messy tops and longer locks are in. For fashion hawks, the move towards lengthier hair is hardly news, but it may not be fashion alone that is driving the shift. Rising costs and tightened belts are among the reasons some believe are behind the trend for longer hair.The average cost of a haircut for men and women in the UK has soared by more than 30% since 2020, according to government data. As a result, many of us have adapted our hairstyles.“We’re still in a cost of living crisis,” said Phil Smith. “Most people are struggling. Anything that’s going to give your hair a bit of a longer life is going to stay in fashion.”For Smith, the owner of the salon Smith England in Salisbury, which caters to men and women, the move towards longer-lasting styles has hit business. “It’s been disastrous,” he said. “People are not coming in as often.”The most common shift he has seen among men is a move away from skin fades, where hair on the sides is cut tightly and blended to created a faded look – a style that needs regular maintenance.View image in fullscreenThe English actor Tom Hardy has his hair textured on top and close-shaved at the sides.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty ImagesInstead, people have opted for taper fades, which provide a similar blended look but retain more length on the upper sides and top.“Short hair is dying out and longer hairstyles are back in fashion,” he said. “When the taper fade is done properly, it lasts that little bit longer. The skin fade lasts two weeks and you’ve got to do it again. When the taper grows out, it looks a bit cooler and messier.”Mullets are also back in fashion, but Smith has a note of caution for those wanting the in-demand do. “If it’s been cut badly, it’s just a throwback toChris Waddle.”View image in fullscreenA Sydney man sporting a sleek haircut known locally as a ‘Mullet’.Photograph: Brook Mitchell/Getty ImagesThe collision of the cost of living crisis with the salon is most keenly felt by women, who have traditionallypaid morefor their hair styling than men. Smith said here too, there have been cost-influenced fashion trends.The treatment that has undergone the largest change is hair colouring. Dyed roots, which need to be redone every 10 to 12 weeks, are out. Balayage, where colour is applied directly to the hair, is all the rage. This treatment only requires a bi-yearly visit to the salon.View image in fullscreenThe actor Rose Byrne has distinctly sun-kissed looking hair.Photograph: Fred Hayes/Getty Images for SAGindie“It looks like sun-kissed ends, lovely hair that’s being lifted by the sunshine,” he said.In his own shop, Smith said he has had to raise his prices by about 15% to 20% as rising costs, including the recent national insurance rise and inflation on salon products, hit hard.“I’ve been doing this for 41 years and this is by far the hardest I’ve ever seen it. The recession and 2008 banking crisis was a walk in the park compared with how things are now,” he said.Bobby Gordon, the owner of the men’s barber Fella, which has branches in London and Kent, has found the climate similarly challenging.“There’s a limit to what people will pay for certain things,” he said. “It’s the same with a haircut. I think the work has been cheapened for a very long time and we’re playing catch-up.”“For a long time, people just assumed a men’s haircut was a tenner. But the quality of work that barbers are doing now is, on the whole, a lot better.”He said the skin fade and shorter styles in general were on their way out. “Hair couldn’t get any shorter unless we started to take people’s scalps off,” he said.He has been forced to raise his prices owing to rising costs, but time is also a factor.“Clients are more demanding, they know what they’re after. They’re not bringing in a picture of a footballer like they did a long time ago. They’ve seen stuff on Instagram and the cuts people want now take a long time to do. It’s not a five-minute job, they take 40 to 45 minutes to do, maybe even an hour,” he said.With longer styles booming in popularity, Fella has introduced a “back and sides” option to entice those who don’t want to pay full whack for a touch-up.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has seen a similar surge in demand for balayage treatments.“Time is a big issue for people. People used to come in every week and have a blow dry. Now, they’re coming in less regularly, so they want services that last,” he said.Scorer said his salons, located around the Thames Valley, are at the “higher end of the market” for the area. Despite this, he has seen new customers expecting to level up their treatments, especially as prices in less-luxury hairdressers have also risen.“People want experiences now, having a haircut here is a lovely experience,” he said. “Beware of false economies. If you come to a salon like ours, the initial price might be more, but we do things like fringe trims for free for three months.”Our experts’ top tips for long-lasting hairstylesFor menTaper fadeFor those who still want a bit of tightness in their cut, the taper fade offers a good balance between some shortness on the sides while retaining some volumising length on top. Because it’s left longer towards the blended top of the head, when it grows out it still retains a good shape, which means less frequent visits to the barber.Mod cutThis longer, textured trim will give your mop some flexibility. You can leave it soft and unkempt and still look fresh or apply some product for a more defined look. The fringe also gives you some hair to play with, which can be slightly parted or left to sit on your forehead. This cut can be done every four to six weeks.View image in fullscreenTimothée Chalamet shows off his textured mod look.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAFor womenForward graduationThis layered, textured cut will give your long, luscious locks some bounce and make your facial features pop.

Celebrating his party’s success at a rally the next day, Nigel Faragesaid staffat these councils working on diversity had “all better really be seeking alternative careers very, very quickly”.Look at how Reform speaks about minorities. Why would Labour want to mimic this nasty party? | Frances RyanRead moreBefore the elections, Farage and other senior Reform figures repeatedly talked up the amount that could be saved by cutting diversity and inclusion roles,modelling their ambitionson efforts to slash US government diversity initiatives by Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” or Doge.One much-repeated figure was that cutting such schemes in central government could save £7bn a year. Official statistics show the actual amount spent in 2022-23, the last year for which figures were available, was £27m.Reform UK said the £7bn figure came from sumscompiled in 2022by a rightwing thinktank, Conservative Way Forward. However, this also covered government budgets for any charities and quangos that carried out what the report saw as “woke” activities.Asked by the BBC shortly after the local elections how much money Reform could save from councils by cutting diversity efforts, the party’s then-chair, Zia Yusuf, was slightly vague. He hinted that some authorities had tried to hide equalities roles by giving them to “other people who have basically that same job but under a different title”.Last month Yusufresigned as chairafter a row about one of the party’s MPs calling for a ban on burqas. Two days later hereturned to Reformas head of its own self-styled “Doge” team intent on finding council savings.Since then, Yusuf has said little about equalities initiatives,beyond praisingReform-run Durham council for “renaming several key departments to remove references to climate change and equality and inclusion”. Durham has 1.8 full-time-equivalent diversity roles, but said that these were all connected to duties required by law.In Junehe saidKent council, also now run by Reform, had spent nearly £90m a year on “a contract for recruitment services”, saying this was 22% of their annual payroll. However, this was not a contract but a framework for a national public sector recruitment system operated by Kent, with critics suggesting this showed Yusuf did not understand procurement systems.Potential savings within councils are limited by the fact that for most county-level authorities,most of their budgetgoes on duties mandated by law, including adult social care and children’s services.Reform UK was contacted for comment. The councils it controls are Derbyshire, Doncaster, Durham, Kent, Lancashire, Lincolnshire, North Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire and West Northamptonshire.Amanda Hopgood, the Liberal Democrat opposition leader on Durham council, who heads the party’s “Reform watch” group, said: “Reform’s Doge programme makes a mockery of what it is supposed to achieve. They are more concerned with stoking division than actually saving councils any money.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKDEI policiesLocal governmentNigel FaragenewsShareReuse this content"

Travel north through the breadbasket of Britain towards the North Sea, from Grantham to Grimsby, and farming gives way to factories, refineries and the Humber docks. Each sector tells a story of Britain’s industrial decline: the demise of heavy industry on the banks of the Humber, the closure of coal power plants, fishing fleets decimated by the cod wars of the 1970s and 80s.Lincolnshire is at the heart of the government’s plan for the greatest economic step-change since the Industrial Revolution: a green re-industrialisation to help galvanise the country’s net zero agenda, create jobs and revitalise deprived areas.Under this vision Britain’s ports will become the industrial heartlands for the burgeoning offshore wind sector, and refineries and factories will pioneer the carbon capture technology considered essential to reach the world’s climate goals. On shore, acres of gleaming solar panels will blanket farmland and the old sites of demolished coal power plants, with miles of pylons and cables crossing the county to connect the North Sea’s windfarms to the power grid.This vision is on a collision course with the rise ofReform UK, as well as the tough economic climate, as the Guardian explores in a series. In few places is this battle more evident than Lincolnshire, a growing base for the hard-right party. Its founder, Nigel Farage, has called the government’s net zero ambitions a “lunacy” that destroys jobs, drives up energy bills and is responsible for the deindustrialising of Britain. He has predicted that the schism over net zero will be the “next Brexit”.Meanwhile, the region’s remaining heavy industry is increasingly imperilled: the government had tointervene in Aprilto prevent the abrupt closure of the Scunthorpe steelworks’ blast furnaces; theLindsey oil refinery near Immingham is in deep financial trouble; and a neighbouring biodiesel plant owned by Greenergy, part of the commodities company Trafigura, is to close.Fortress on the FensThe consequences of that revolt against net zero are not only economic; they are profoundly political too.In the market town of Boston in Lincolnshire, its former mayor is considering his future in local politics. Anton Dani was one of a handful of Conservative councillors who survived the march of rightwing populism across the county in recent years. The former Ukip councillor last month resigned from the Tory party and is considering another move – defecting to Reform.“What they do best is talk to people face to face,” he says. . “It’s an idea lost on the big political parties.”View image in fullscreenAnton Dani, a former mayor of Boston, at his cafe in the town. ‘They’re misleading the country on net zero,’ he says.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverLincolnshire is one of 10 local councils now controlled by Reform. It is also home to the party’s deputy, Richard Tice, the member of parliament for Boston and Skegness. The former Conservative minister Andrea Jenkyns was elected mayor for Greater Lincolnshire afterswitching to Reform in November.The party’s rise to power was built on the success of the Brexit referendum campaign, Dani says, when the deepening concerns over immigration found a voice in the national conversation.Solar energy graphicLincolnshire was among the UK’s most Eurosceptic counties, with Boston recording the highest level of support for Brexit in the country, with 75.6% of votes cast in favour of leaving the EU in the 2016 referendum.Today the same dissatisfaction with the established status quo is taking aim at the government’s long-held climate orthodoxy, bringing the concerns about Britain’s green agenda into mainstream politics for the first time after years of cross-party support.Reform UK has said it will scrap the UK’s net zero legislation – and renewable energy subsidies along with it. A carbon-heavy pivot would accompany that: a Reform government would invest directly in North Sea oil and gas production, which it claims would secure the UK’s energy supplies and the workforce supported by the industry.The party’s hardline stance has won support from people who fear that their livelihoods are at risk in part because of the UK’s shift away from fossil fuels. It also resonates with those who support cutting emissions through an expansion of renewable energy but disagree with the way the government has chosen to achieve this.A ‘scar on the countryside’In Lincolnshire a groundswell of resistance to the government’s solar power agenda is stoking the party’s popularity, according to Marianne Overton, an independent county councillor.“This is the Lincolnshire countryside,” Overton says, driving north from Grantham, the birthplace of Margaret Thatcher, towards the site of the planned Springwell solar farm. The proposed site sprawls across 4,200 hectares, the size of 2,800 football pitches, between Lincoln and Sleaford.David Suiter, an independent local councillor who has joined Overton in campaigning against the project, says: “If you look at a map, it will leave an enormous scar on North Kesteven. The scale is quite alarming.”The government has already given the green light to six big solar farms across the country since last summer, including the Cottam Solar Farm. The largest solar farm ever approved in the UK stretches across 1,270 hectares, straddling Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire on the site of the old Cottam coal power station, which shut in 2019, months after Theresa May’s government enshrined in law a commitment to reachnet zero carbon emissions by 2050, making Britain the first major economy to do so.There are far more solar farms awaiting approval in Lincolnshire than in any other county in the country, many dwarfing the Cottam project. Within months of Labour’s election victory Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, pledged to“take on the blockers, the delayers, the obstructionists”who have opposed the rollout of wind turbines, solar farms and pylons across the UK as a matter of “national security” and “economic justice”.“It was wicked, in my opinion,” says Overton of Miliband’s pledge. The tough political stance has alienated many in Lincolnshire who fear that the government’s “builders and blockers” rhetoric will be mean Lincolnshire is forced to bear the brunt of the government’s plan to triple the UK’s solar power capacity.Lincolnshire is expected to host more solar farms and battery centres than the rest of the country owing to the high number of defunct coal plants in the area that allow solar developers to reuse the old grid connections.The county already hosts a network of overhead power lines and substations after decades as a major coal power generator. But the march of pylons is expected to continue as part of the UK’s £58bn grid repowering plan, bringing power generated by the windfarms in the North Sea and Scotland ashore via the Lincolnshire coast.Last year plans were put forward to bring power 250 miles south, from a Scottish windfarm, along a cable laid on the sea bed, before terminating at two grid connection points in central and southern Lincolnshire. That proposal followed plans for an overland pylon route from Grimsby to Walpole, and five large electricity substations.The pressures facing British farms mean that for some landowners solar power could prove to be their most lucrative crop in decades. But for tenant farmers, a decision to swap crops for solar panels means losing their livelihoods.“Why are we losing some of the best agricultural land in the world to put up solar panels imported from Chinese companies which use coal power to run their factories?” Overton said.“If the government is so concerned about emissions why aren’t all new buildings forced to be as close to energy self-sufficient as possible? If solar is the right solution, wouldn’t they start by requiring all commercial buildings to be covered in solar and be as efficient as feasible?”Ultimately, ministers will need to do all these things and more to meet the 2050 deadline and tackle the climate crisis.Generating more renewable energy is also central to the government’s industrial strategy, aimed at lowering the overall cost of energy for manufacturers and businesses. But Overton wants pragmatism in how the renewables rollout is implemented.“I don’t think anyone here is against net zero when it makes sense. A local housing estate had rooftop solar installed recently which was extremely popular – it earns money for the council and still lowers bills. Wouldn’t it make sense to do this everywhere before industrialising the countryside?”‘No such thing as a green welder’The resistance to net zero in areas such as Lincolnshire may be explained in part by the belief in many local communities that the government’s green agenda will not create as many jobs or as much economic benefit as Britain’s deindustrialisation has taken.In total, green jobs employed an estimated 639,400 in 2022, the Office for National Statistics shows. The majority of these jobs were in the waste industry, and about 2% were in renewable energy, according to the official data.Although green jobs are growing fast, anannual surveyof the sector by the auditor PwC found that the boom is not spread equally across Britain’s regions. In Scotland, green jobs make up 5.6% of the new jobs on offer, but in the East Midlands the figure is behind the national average of 3.3% at just 3.1%.Growth in green jobs has also been most evident in London. The number advertised in the capital has climbed by almost a third since 2023, while in the East Midlands green jobs offered have risen by just over 6%.By 2030 between 135,000 to 725,000 net new green jobs could be created, with the majority of these in installing energy-efficiency measures such as insulation and low-carbon heating, it found.Green jobs graphicThe leader of North East Lincolnshire council, Philip Jackson, says that while Britain’s booming offshore wind industry will soon create enough “good, high-paid jobs” in Grimsby to push up the average salary across Lincolnshire, “a lot of people in the area don’t yet realise that all this stuff is going on”.“The offshore wind operations and maintenance facilities are confined to the ports, and the windfarms they serve are miles offshore,” he says.The green jobs that are visible to the public – those building solar farms and grid connections – are often taken up by people coming into the area rather than local people, he adds.“We need our residents to be able to take up the opportunities which are available in clean energy. The use of the word ‘green’ doesn’t help because people assume that it’s not for them. But actually we need skills that could be used across all sectors.”For David Talbot, the boss of local skills and apprentice group Catch, part of the problem is in defining a “green job”.“This is a transient workforce – they go where the work is – and sometimes that will be a refinery and then it might be carbon capture,” he says. “The lines between traditional industrial jobs and green jobs are a lot more blurred than you’d think.”Earlier this year the government earmarked Lincolnshire alongside Aberdeenshire, Cheshire and Pembrokeshire for new, government-backed training programmes to help local people take advantage of the jobs created in clean energy.“We are always very clear: we don’t need ‘green skills’ to get to net zero, we need traditional skills,” says Talbot. “Don’t get me wrong, green skills are needed at the higher levels of industry where people are designing carbon capture, for example.“But there is a huge skills gap lower down which needs to be filled. And at the end of the day, there’s no such thing as a ‘green’ welder. People might not realise that they’re part of the net zero journey, but they’re absolutely critical to reaching our climate targets. Traditional trades are needed at scale to meet these targets.”In Boston, Dani remains unconvinced. “I wouldn’t say [the government is] lying, but they’re misleading the country on net zero. We’ve been given slogans for hope, and spent billions, but it hasn’t made things better for people. Really, the decline of Britain’s industries isn’t about immigration or net zero. It’s about the arrogance of the major parties.”Unless Labour can convince voters of the merits of cutting emissions and net zero – and that well-paid jobs will follow – Reform intends to convince the people of Lincolnshire of another way.Explore more on these topicsRenewable energyRise of the rightSolar powerLincolnshireEnergyReform UKWind powerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One does well in mainstream school, with adaptations; the other cannot survive in a mainstream environment at all – everything about it triggers him.Any minister who wants to do away with special educational needs and disabilities(Send) settings should be required to leave their quiet office and spend a week conducting their duties in a busy secondary school (After disability benefits, is Labour really about to target the educational rights of special needs children?, 7 July).Every 55 minutes they must drop what they are doing and move to a different room to work on a completely different ministerial portfolio, regardless of their interest in or aptitude for it. A few times a week, they will be required change for PE in a room full of people.Why is it so hard for government to understand that “inclusion” does not mean “force everyone into a single framework regardless how unsuitable it is”? It means understanding, respecting and acting appropriately, as everyone has different needs.Rachel TaylorLewes, East SussexThe battle to acquire an education, health and care plan (EHCP) is not easily won. All too frequently it requires tenacity, resilience and no small measure of confidence and skill to negotiate the appeal and tribunal process.As a teacher, barrister and former representative of Independent Provider of Special Education Advice, the leading charity in the field of Send law in England, I know this from first-hand experience. My own child had complex medical needs and I was astounded when my local authority said that they did not meet the threshold (clearly defined in the Children and Families Act 2014). I appealed, successfully, but had to attend a hearing at a magistrates court.I understand why local authorities are not supportive of EHCP applications; they know they do not have the funds to meet the plans. Watering down, or removing children’s rights to support can never be the answer. Adequately funded Send support enables children to be successful. My own child, with a plan in place throughout secondary school, was able to go on to achieve a first‑class degree. I fear that this might not be the outcome for our next generation of children.Susan HailesFowlmere, CambridgeshireYour correspondents (Letters, 6 July) make a powerful case for the need to support children with additional educational needs, but I feel that they are mistaken in trying to perpetuate the current use of EHCPs.I was, for many years, a governor of two secondary schools and witnessed the problems with the EHCP “system” with mounting despair. The processes have become so complex that they are almost inaccessible to parents who lack the skills to navigate an administrative labyrinth, which discriminates against some of the neediest.The time taken to secure a plan can be so protracted that it is pointless for junior schools to initiate a request late in the child’s time with them; the secondary school may struggle to support the child for their first year and only get a plan by the end of year 8 – meaning that children at a crucial stage in their school life lack additional support for as much as three years.Any system with these features needs replacement, and I would urge your readers to welcome the opportunity to achieve this.Dick QuibellLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Last week, the heads of churches in Taybeh, the last remaining Christian-majority town in the West Bank, spoke out against the series of systematic attacks by settlers on the town’s land and holy sites, including St George’s, its fifth-century church.As well as threatening the town’s security and livelihood, these attacks undermine the dignity of its Christian residents and threaten their historical and religious heritage. Residents fear expulsion from their land and homes. This is part of a wider strategy of control and coercion rendering life unviable for Palestinians across the occupied territory. Successive Israeli governments have used settler violence as an informal tool to annex Palestinian land.The current Israeli government appears to support these violent settler acts through the military and police not intervening. As a rule, the military prefers to remove Palestinians from their land rather than confront settlers. Complaints are difficult to file. Few investigations are opened. Where indictments are made, it is for minor offences. Where convictions occur, the penalties are token.This culture of impunity rewards settler violence. There is no plausible deniability here – settlers aren’t defying the state; they are doing its bidding. Settler violence is state violence by any other name.This situation must not continue. The UK government must stop its indecision and publish its legal response to last July’s international court of justice advisory opinion that found Israel’s presence in the occupied territory to be unlawful.It must intensify sanctions against individuals, illegal settler outposts and organisations that support violence against Palestinians in the occupied territory. But it also needs to hold the Israeli government to account by signalling its willingness to suspend the UK-Israel trade agreement. The UK government has a legal and moral duty to ensure Britain is taking all necessary steps to address settler violence, which threatens not just the peace of the region but the continued presence of Christians in this Holy Land.Guli Francis-DehqaniBishop of Chelmsford,Rachel TreweekBishop of Gloucester,Graham UsherBishop of Norwich,Christopher ChessunBishop of SouthwarkExplore more on these topicsWest BankIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaAnglicanismChristianityReligionlettersShareReuse this content"

Plus a letter fromDiana FrancisSun 13 Jul 2025 12.55 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Jul 2025 14.33 EDTShareHeather Stewart is right (The spirit of the G8 ‘make poverty history’ summit of 2005 seems long gone, 6 July). Twenty years later, we are in a completely different world, facing overlapping crises and a retreat from global responsibility.In just the first half of 2025 alone,USAIDhas been dismantled, and the UK, France, Germany and Canada have all scaled back their development budgets. Many lower-income countries are still reeling from crises that they did not cause, spending more on debt repayments than on healthcare or education.Although the UK aid budget is not likely to increase any time soon, the government still has a chance to honour itsmanifesto pledge“to rebuild Britain’s reputation on international development”. It must set a bold agenda by championing debt relief and reforms to the global economic system, including making the international tax system fairer, in order to scale up countries’ public financing. The recentFinancing for Development summit in Spainwas a missed opportunity. With a concerted effort to build public support, the UK government must show that international solidarity is not a thing of the past.Romilly GreenhillCEO,Bond, the UK network for NGOsRegarding Simon Tisdall’s article (The UN is our best defence against a third world war. As Trump wields the axe, who will fight to save it? 6 July), the UN is probably weaker than it has ever been, but it is needed as never before, as is internationalism more generally, expressed in dialogue, cooperation and the solidarity of financial aid. That our prime minister has “slashed its aid budget by £6bn, to pay for nuclear bombs”, andplans to build six new arms factories, boasting that the defence industry will become “an engine for economic growth”, shows how unlikely it is that the UK will contribute to the growth of internationalism and strengthening of the UN.War’s ever-greater barbarity and destruction at the human level is at the same time a massive assault on nature, causing pollution and carbon emissions on a grand scale. Who will fight to strengthen and reform the UN, build global cooperation and create a future for the world’s children? We must, all of us, in an international movement of the willing and the caring, before it really is too late.Diana FrancisBathHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Many hoped the retired major general would crack down on armed groups, just as he had as the country’s military head of state.Instead, violence that had mostly been confined to the north-east spread. That left swathes ofNigeriaoutside the control of the stretched security forces as gunmen in the north-west, armed separatists and gangs in the south-east roamed unchecked.Much of Buhari’s appeal lay in the anti-corruption ethos that was a central plank of his agenda as a military and civilian ruler. He said endemic corruption in Nigeria’s political culture was holding people back.But Buhari quickly disappointed after his 2015 win. He took six months to name his cabinet. During that time, the oil-dependent economy was hobbled by low crude prices, prompting people to call him “Baba Go Slow”.His second victory in 2019 came despite his first term being blighted by Nigeria’s first recession in a generation, militant attacks on oilfields, and repeated hospital stays.Nigeria election: ‘Mr Honesty’ tainted by failure to tackle corruptionRead moreBuhari was born on 17 December 1942 in Daura, in the north-west state of Katsina, and enrolled in the army at 19. He would eventually rise to the rank of major general.He seized power in 1983 as a military ruler, promising to revitalise a mismanaged country. Buhari took a tough line on everything from the conditions sought by the International Monetary Fund to unruliness in bus queues.In 1984, his administration attempted to kidnap a former minister and vocal critic living in Britain. The plot failed when London airport officials opened a crate containing the abducted politician.His first stint in power was short-lived. He was removed after only 18 months by another military officer, Ibrahim Babangida.Buhari spent much of the following 30 years in fringe political parties and trying to run for president until his eventual victory over Jonathan in 2015.Explore more on these topicsMuhammadu BuhariNigeriaGoodluck JonathanAfricaLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

The prior deal would have involved a 10% tariff, five times the pre-Trump tariff, which the bloc already described as “pain”.The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, on Sunday said he will work intensively with French president Emmanuel Macron and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen to resolve the escalating trade war with the United States.“I discussed this intensively over the weekend with both Macron and Ursula von der Leyen,” Merz told German broadcaster ARD, adding he had also spoken with Trump about the matter.“We want to use this time now, the two and half weeks until August 1 to find a solution. I am really committed to this,” Merz said.Merz said the German economy would be hit hard by the tariffs, and he was doing his best to make sure US tariffs of 30% were not imposed.Unity in Europe and a sensible dialogue with the US president were now needed, Merz said, although countermeasures should not be ruled out. “But not before August 1,” he said.EU trade ministers are scheduled to meet on Monday for a pre-arranged summit and will be under pressure from some countries to implement €21bn ($24.6bn) in retaliatory measures, which are now paused until 1 August, the same day asTrump’s new deadline.Macron hascalled onthe EU to “defend European interests resolutely” in response to Trump’s threats.French cheese and wine producers have warned of the damaging impact that Trump’s threatened 30% tariffs on imports from the EU would have on the country’s agriculture industry.A 30% duty would be “disastrous” for France’s food industry, said Jean-François Loiseau, the president of food lobby group ANIA, while Francois Xavier Huard, the CEO of dairy association FNIL, said: “It’s a real shock for milk and cheese producers – this is an important market for us.”Macron calls on EU to ‘defend European interests resolutely’ from Trump tariffsRead moreIn the interview with ABC News on Sunday, Hassett also said that Trump has the authority to fire the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, for cause if evidence supports that, adding that the Fed “has a lot to answer for” on renovation cost overruns at its Washington headquarters.Any decision by Trump to try to fire Powell over what theTrump administrationcalls a $700bn cost overrun “is going to depend a lot on the answers that we get to the questions that Russ Vought sent to the Fed”, Hassett said.Vought, the White House budget director, last week slammed Powell over an “ostentatious overhaul” of the Fed’s buildings and answers to a series of questions. Trump has repeatedly said that Powellshould resignbecause he has not lowered interest rates, and the Wall Street Journalreportedthis week, citing anonymous sources, that Hassett is vying to succeed him as the Fed chair.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrump administrationUS economyDonald TrumpMexicoEuropean UnionAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He said Australia wanted to see “peace and security” in the region.Following multiple reports this week that the Pentagon was seeking guarantees from Australia and other allies about how they would respond in the event of a conflict in the Indo-Pacific, Conroy said any commitment to war would be the decision of the Australian government of the day.The Financial Times reportedon Saturdaythat Elbridge Colby – the US under-secretary of defence for policy, who is also undertaking a review of the Aukus pact which would see America share nuclear-powered submarines with Australia – was asking Japan and Australia to reveal how they would act in a potential US-China war over Taiwan.Anthony Albanese faces diplomatic tightrope in China as spectre of Trump and Aukus review looms largeRead moreThe Sydney Morning Herald separately quoted a senior US defence official, who reportedly said Washington was seeking “a clear sense of what we can expect from Australia”.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailContacted for comment, a Pentagon spokesperson referred Guardian Australia to a post on X from Colby on Sunday (AEST) which referenced the FT article. In hispost, Colby wrote that the US policy position included “urging allies to step up their defense spending and other efforts related to our collective defense”.“This has been a hallmark of President Trump’s strategy – in Asia as in Europe where it has already been tremendously successful.“Of course, some among our allies might not welcome frank conversations. But many, now led by NATO after the historic Hague Summit, are seeing the urgent need to step up and are doing so.”Albanese arrived in China on Saturday night for a six-day visit,which includes meetings with president Xi Jinpingand premier Li Qiang, with the government saying the trip was about advancing Australia’s security and economic interests.In a press conference, he repeatedly rebuffed questions on the reports and any US demands, noting Australia had increased defence spending, and repeating his assertion thatAukuswas of benefit to all three nations.“We support the status quo when it comes to Taiwan. We don’t support any unilateral action there … We want peace and security in our region,” Albanese said.Asked by a journalist whether it would be reasonable for the US to demand an assurance on a Taiwan conflict, when America itself maintains a policy of strategic ambiguity, Albanese responded: “You’ve just answered the question yourself.”Pressed to elaborate on that answer, he replied: “I think you can get it.”Conroy, a cabinet minister whose portfolio deals heavily with preparing to build the Aukus submarines, also rebuked the idea Australia would commit in advance to any conflict.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That is our position. Sovereignty will always be prioritised and that will continue to be our position,” Conroy told the ABC’s Insiders program.Conroy said he would not comment on the nature of confidential discussions with the US over Aukus, but said the government would not “discuss hypotheticals” around what Australia could do in a potential future military engagement.“The decision to commit Australian troops to a conflict will be made by the government of the day, not in advance but by the government of the day,” he stressed.On Sky News on Sunday, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, described the Australia-China relationship as “full of opportunity but not short of complexity either”.In Australia’s post-US future, we must find our own way with China | Hugh WhiteRead moreIt is unclear when the US may give any further public clarity on Colby’s review of Aukus, which was initially described as a 30-day process. The start date of the review is unclear, but it is now 30 days since it was publicly announced. On Insiders, Conroy also declined to respond to reports that Trump may seek further costs from Canberra to fulfil the Aukus submarine deal, which would see the US sell several older boats to Canberra before new assets are constructed onshore in Australia.“Let’s see what the review finds. I’m confident it will support Aukus, just as our review of Aukus found, just as the UK review of Aukus found that. It’s in the national interest of all three countries. It will contribute to deterrence as well as grow 20,000 jobs in Australia. Let’s see what the US review comes forward with, then we’ll react accordingly,” he said.Guardian Australia reported this week thatLabor sources don’t expect the review to be completed for months, while a Pentagon spokesperson said last week there was no public timeline for the work. Conroy said he didn’t believe the report had been completed.The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, met her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi at the Asean summit in Malaysia on Friday. Government sources said she raised a number of Australian concerns with Beijing, including the circumnavigation of Australia by a Chinese naval taskforce andlive-fire exercises,as well as unsafe actions in the South China Sea.

New Caledonian elected officials, as well as political, economic and civil society leaders, gathered near Paris to hammer out a constitutional framework for the territory.After 10 days of talks, the parties agreed that a “State of New Caledonia” should be created.Manuel Valls, the minister for overseas territories, called it an “intelligent compromise” that maintains links between France and New Caledonia, but with more sovereignty for the Pacific island.View image in fullscreenFrench politicians and New Caledonian officials and state representatives celebrate the agreement.Photograph: Tom Nicholson/EPAThe priority now is New Caledonia’s economic recovery.Last year’s violence, which claimed the lives of 14 people, is estimated to have cost the territory 2bn euros ($2.3 bn), shaving 10% off its gross domestic product, he said.The French prime minister, Francois Bayrou, said Saturday’s deal – which still requires parliamentary and referendum approval – was of “historic dimensions”.Home to about 270,000 people and located nearly 17,000km (10,600 miles) from Paris, New Caledonia is one of several overseas territories that remain an integral part of France.It has been ruled from Paris since the 1800s, butmany indigenous Kanaks still resent France’s powerover their islands and want fuller autonomy or independence.Unrest broke out in May 2024 after Paris planned to give voting rights to thousands of non-indigenous long-term residents. Kanaks feared this would leave them in a permanent minority, crushing their chances of winning independence.As part of the agreement, New Caledonia residents will in future only be allowed to vote after having lived 10 years on the archipelago.Thelast independence referendum in New Caledoniawas held in 2021, and was boycotted by pro-independence groups over the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Kanak population.It was the latest of three since 2018, all of which rejected New Caledonian independence. Since the 2021 referendum however, the political situation in the archipelago has been deadlocked.Macron declared in early June he wanted a “new project” for New Caledonia.The 13-page agreement announced on Saturday calls for a New Caledonian nationality, and the possibility for residents there to combine that status with French nationality.Under the deal, a “State of New Caledonia” would be enshrined in France’s constitution, and other countries could recognise such a state.The deal also calls for an economic and financial recovery pact that would include a renewal of the territory’s nickel processing capabilities.Both chambers of France’s parliament are to meet in the fourth quarter of this year to vote on approving the deal, which is then to be submitted to New Caledonians in a referendum in 2026.Explore more on these topicsNew CaledoniaFranceAsia PacificPacific islandsnewsShareReuse this content"

The group is also planning a campaign to gather further support from moreLabor partybranches.The special envoy’s plan is the latest push to weaponise antisemitism in Australia, as a relentless campaign pays off | Louise AdlerRead more“There is a groundswell of outrage among rank-and-file Labor members,” Peter Moss, a co-convener of Labor Friends of Palestine, told Guardian Australia.“There is deep concern about the use of the IHRA definition which has been deployed to stifle criticism of the State of Israel.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailAlbanese is now mulling a response to envoy Segal’s49 recommendations to stamp out anti-Jewish hate. It is widely expected the government could focus its response on the education and prevention measures in Segal’s plan. More complex recommendations, such as defunding universities or academic grants, would face more significant debate.Guardian Australia reported on Friday that Segal’s push for the federal government to “require” the IHRA definition “to be used across all levels of government and public institutions” will face pushback from some concerned Labor MPs and party members. That definitionis contested in some quarters, with concerns it was increasingly being used to conflate antisemitism with criticism of Israel.Other Labor voices believed some criticism of Segal’s report had been an overreaction, noting attacks on synagogues as an issue that required action.Albanese in 2021 committed federal Labor to the IHRA definition, as did the then prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the then Labor premier, Daniel Andrews, in 2022. However it’s understood that any federal push to codify or more widely embed the definition into various sectors would face internal pushback from some federal MPs.Albanese and Segal have both said legitimate criticism of the Israeli government, including its military actions in Gaza, would not be forbidden.Moss and his co-conveners told Albanese in their letter that many Labor members would reject the wider adoption of the IHRA definition, claiming it had been “been deployed to stifle criticism of the policies and practices of the State of Israel and undermine the capacity of the Palestinian people to assert their rights under international law”.The group noteda 2023 open letter from more than 100 Israeli and international civil society organisations– including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the American Civil Liberties Union – which asked the United Nations to reject the IHRA definition because it is being “misused” to protect Israel from legitimate criticism.Moss and the group’s other co-conveners also wrote to the prime minister of their concerns about some of Segal’s recommendations.“Proposals for amendments to immigration law, changes to school curriculum or reform of funding arrangements for universities and cultural institutions are beyond the scope or expertise of the envoy and should be rejected,” they wrote.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Labor government also instituted an envoy to combat Islamophobia, Aftab Malik, who said last week his report would be sent to government in August.“More than 100 members from around Australia have reached out to Labor Friends of Palestine in the past 24 hours asking us to speak out urgently on this issue,” Moss said.“Labor members want the prime minister to reject the envoy’s plan and review the envoy’s position.”Explore more on these topicsLabor partyAustralian politicsAntisemitismRaceLaw (Australia)newsShareReuse this content"

The program aims to provide Indigenous women and their babies with culturally safe care before, during and after birth.In August 2022, Bani saw that the Aboriginal midwife on duty had been described using a derogatory term as ‘“Abo MW” on a whiteboard in the hospital’s women and babies ambulatory care clinic. The whiteboard was used to record staff movements.View image in fullscreenBani said she was left feeling drained by a 12-month inquiry into her complaint, which concluded without an outcome as the hospital said there was insufficient evidenceBani said she quit the job in 2024 due to chronic stress, overwork and burnout, but the slur was the last straw.She made a complaint to the hospital’s senior management, who began an internal investigation. But Bani said she was left feeling drained by the 12-month inquiry, which concluded without an outcome as the hospital said there was insufficient evidence.“It just it started to really drag me,” she said. “I was fighting a battle that I couldn’t fight alone and it came down to, basically, racism.”‘Wrapped in culture’: NSW birthing centre next step in long road to better maternity services for Aboriginal mothersRead moreBani said she wanted the hospital to introduce specific cultural awareness and anti-racism training to improve cultural safety for both staff and patients.“People don’t understand simple cultural awareness and just [the] appropriateness of culture. It just really ticked me off that [they] could drag this whole [process] out and keep me tight lipped, keep pressuring me,” she said.She said one manager didn’t realise the use of the slur was an issue and asked “What is wrong with it?”, until another non-Indigenous colleague raised her concerns. Bani said she also felt she was treated differently from her lighter-skinned colleagues.“There is a lot of colourism too,” she said. “I mentioned that a lot in our clinical reviews, that I’m really struggling because I’m a darker skinned girl, and I’m not getting the same treatment.”In response to Guardian Australia, a spokesperson for the Sydney local health district, which includes the RPA, said racism was unacceptable and that the whiteboard incident had been thoroughly investigated.They said the hospital had since introduced a number of changes including mandatory cultural training for all staff in partnership with the Redfern Aboriginal medical service; an Aboriginal workforce network and a dedicated manager to promote a culturally safe workplace; and an elders network to improve culturally appropriate decision-making.Cuts to Aboriginal midwife programThis month the RPA announcedcuts to the number of midwives it employs, including a plan to merge the Aboriginal midwifery program with the general midwifery program, meaning the midwives will no longer be dedicated to Indigenous patients.The proposal sparked swift condemnation from current and former staff and prompted the hospital to promise a review of the decision.Paige Austin, one of only two current midwives assigned to the Aboriginal midwifery program, said it should have five full-time midwives.She spoke to Guardian Australia in her capacity as a member of theNew South WalesNurses and Midwives’ Association, and said many women come to the program with fear or trauma from past negative experiences with healthcare providers and have complex social and health needs.All parents need someone in their corner like we had. But for First Nations parents, having an Aboriginal midwife is essential | Narelda Jacobs and Karina NattRead more“There’s a real systemic racism in hospitals, and there’s history with Indigenous women around healthcare, and there’s just mistrust,” Austin said. “I think you can speak to any Indigenous family and find trauma that they’ve had with the healthcare system.”Austin said the work done by the program “isn’t just midwifery”.“We’re social workers, we’re caseworkers, we’re looking out for the women,” she said. “We work a lot with drugs and alcohol. We have meetings with DcJ, there’s extra things that normal MGP doesn’t do.”The Sydney local health district said the Aboriginal midwifery program remained available for Aboriginal women, despite staff no longer being dedicated just to that purpose, and they would receive holistic, culturally safe and trauma-informed maternity care at RPA.In a statement, it said the hospital made “every effort to fill vacancies within maternity services when they arise” and was committed to providing high quality care.Guardian Australia has beeninvestigating alleged racism and discriminationin mainstream maternity services.Prof Catherine Chamberlain is a Palawa woman, the chief midwifery officer for the Congress of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Nurses and Midwives, a professor in Indigenous health at the University of Melbourne and a former midwife. She said culturally safe and supportive workplaces were essential for all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff but that when she has asked at conferences if anyone had witnessed a lack of cultural safety in a healthcare setting, “every single person put their hand up”.“Unfortunately the reality is I’ve heard so many anecdotal stories of where people have reported instances of racism and lack of cultural safety in the workplace, and it just hasn’t been dealt with,” she said.“It is really critically important that all people experience care that’s safe, otherwise there’s a risk that people don’t access the care that they need.”Chamberlain said creating a culturally safe workplace could help reduce the high rates of attrition among Aboriginal healthcare workers.“We’ve got a huge challenge trying to recruit and retain Aboriginal nurses and midwives and there’s a whole lot of reasons for that including institutional racism and structural barriers,” she said.Explore more on these topicsIndigenous AustraliansBirth rightsHealthNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

A realistic future military and diplomatic strategy for Kyiv has to accept that fact – and formulate a new approach.The past six months have been dominated by the erroneous assumption that it would be possible for Trump to negotiate a ceasefire, even an armistice. That would be followed by the arrival of an Anglo-French led stabilisation force to secure the future of Ukraine. But Putin has shown no desire to stop attacking.A fresh Russian ground offensive is emerging towards Velykyi Burluk, 50 miles east of Kharkiv, and for now is making some rare gains: three miles in 10 days. More significantly, the cynical bombing of Ukraine’s cities by missile and drone is only intensifying, straining Kyiv’s air defences and leading to more civilian casualties.A record 728 Shahed drones and 13 missiles were launched on the night of 8 July and the next morning, many at Lutsk in the west, though the bombardment of 597 drones and 26 missiles on Friday night and Saturday morning showed no slackening of violent intent. It will be soon possible for Russia to attack with 1,000 drones in a night, Ukraine believes.Ina paper written last month, Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defence minister, said “an acceptable armistice may never formally arrive” and that Kyiv should formulate “a revised theory of victory” – which accepts that the Kremlin considers itself engaged in a forever war against its smaller neighbour.The former minister describes the new approach as “strategic neutralisation”, a permanent and dynamic military effort to ensure that Russia’s forces cannot advance and that Moscow becomes “operationally incapable of disrupting key aspects of Ukrainian strategic, political, economic, and social life”.It accepts that Ukraine cannot retake territories already occupied by Moscow, or attack again into Russia, as happened into Kursk oblast last summer, and instead pursues an active defence.As an example for what might be possible, Zagorodnyuk refers to the situation in the Black Sea. Ukraine, which began the war without a navy, had managed to box in the Russian Black Sea fleet by mid-2023 by successfully sinking and threatening to sink warships with remotely piloted sea drones.The result is the “functional defeat” of the Russian fleet, a phrase first used by a former British junior defence minister, James Heappey. Kyiv was able to unilaterally reopen a corridor for grain shipments from Odesa and nearby areas in 2023 without having to negotiate a special exemption for such traffic with Russia.One question is whether strategic neutralisation is possible on land. Russia has struggled to gain territory inside Ukraine during 2025, though it has collapsed the Kursk pocket, and its forces incurred casualty rates (killed and wounded) of about 1,100 a day in June – showing that Kyiv can roughly hold the line largely with the help of £300-£370 ($400-$500) first-person view (FPV) drones that it can manufacture in bulk.But the strategy goes further. The military aim in such a plan would be to extend the depth of FPV drone operations to 25, 50 or even 100 miles – to create a zone where it is effectively impossible for Russian forces to mass – and even to walk to the frontline. Rather than create a Korean style demilitarised zone, the effect would be to create a highly militarised zone in which Russian forces could not operate, a de facto border.The already slow rate of Russian advance suggests this approach may be possible, though an important question is what will happen once the last of the US military aid approved by former president Joe Biden tails off. It is also challenged by Russia’s expanding volume of missile and drone attacks – which in turn come at a time of growing concern about the amount of available air defence interceptors.A series of ill-judged signals from the US reveal that the Pentagon is worried about the number of Patriot air defence missiles it has available, probably the single most important air defence system used by Ukraine. Weapons deliveries were halted at the end of last month amid fears US stockpiles were low (perhaps at 25% of the desired levels), though Trump has partially relented, sending a symbolic 10 Patriot missiles last week.The US president, finally acknowledging that Putin is stalling, has promiseda “major announcement” on Monday, which may involve extra sanctions on Russia and allowing European countries to buy more weapons for Kyiv. It would make strategic sense if whatever is offered comes with the recognition that Putin is not serious about peace – and gives Ukraine what it needs to neutralise the aggressor.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

The bloc declared a further pause on €21bn of retaliatory tariffs until 1 August, dovetailing with the US president’s new deal deadline.At the same time, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the Indonesian president, Prabowo Subianto, announced a “political agreement” on a free trade deal on Sunday, ending nine years of negotiations.Indonesia, one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, had recently come to the view that the EU, despite its hostility to regulation, was a more stable partner than the US, said one diplomat.The EU has stepped up its efforts to forge new agreements with South American and Asian partners after Trump blew up the world’s trading system, with hopes that deals with India, Thailand and others can be concluded by year end.Macron said the EU should be ready for a trade war and to stand up to the US president, who was only last week expected to approve a 10% tariff agreement in principle with the bloc.“It is more than ever up to the commission to assert the union’s determination to defend European interests resolutely,” Macron said on social media. “In particular, this implies accelerating the preparation of credible countermeasures, by mobilising all the instruments at its disposal, including anti-coercion, if no agreement is reached by 1 August.”EU will be reeling over how to tackle trade talks after Trump’s 30% tariff threatRead moreOther European leaders called for calm, including in Italy, the Netherlands,Germanyand Ireland. But reflecting the shock around the bloc over Trump’s threat, the influential Federation of German Industries (BDI) said Trump’s announcement was “a wake-up call for the industry on both sides of the Atlantic”.Macron’s call for trade war readiness came in contrast to Berlin, which urged a “pragmatic” response.The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said he had spoken directly to Trump, underlining a driving role he is playing to shape EU tactics ahead of Trump’s new 1 August deadline.“I discussed this intensively over the weekend with both Macron and Ursula von der Leyen,” Merz told German broadcaster ARD. “We want to use this time now, the two and half weeks until August 1 to find a solution. I am really committed to this.”Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister ofItaly, who enjoys good relations with Trump, said in a statement she trusted “a fair agreement” could be reached. “It would make no sense to trigger a trade war between the two sides of the Atlantic,” she said.The Dutch prime minister, Dick Schoof, said on social media the EU “must remain united and resolute” in its aim to reach a “mutually beneficial” deal with the US.Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Harris, said that it was all part of Trump’s playbook which “recognises the need for a deal” and that the hike in tariffs was “his way” of negotiating.The White House economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, said on Sunday that Trump would proceedwith threatened tariffson the EU, Mexico, and other countries if the trade deal offers did not improve. “Well, these tariffs are real if the president doesn’t get a deal that he thinks is good enough,” he told ABC’s This Week programme. “But you know, conversations are ongoing, and we’ll see where the dust settles.”EU ambassadors were briefed on the latest development at an emergency meeting in Brussels on Sunday. Sources said they were keen to show unity and support for the commission’s plan to continue negotiations. EU trade ministers are to meet on Monday.Von der Leyen warned on Sunday: “We will continue to prepare for countermeasures, so we are fully prepared,” while describing the Indonesia deal as a “huge milestone” that would help diversify markets. She also said the EU would continue to simplify the single market to “deepen” the opportunities within the bloc for trade, “because this is our safe harbour”.The threat of a 30% tariff is being seen as a negotiating tactic, but behind the scenes there is fury, with many viewing it as a dangerous transatlantic game at a time of grave global instability.Trump’s latest salvo is in line with hisApril “liberation day”claim that the EU was charging unfair duties of 39% on US imports, an analysis widely discredited, with EU officials pointing to an average of about 2.5%.View image in fullscreenTrump’s ‘liberation day’ tariff chart.Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty ImagesSome MEPs have warned that if they start accepting “illegal” tariffs as the new norm, Trump will just come back for more. “It is matter of showing the EU is not a victim, is not paralysed in itself or scared,” the Italian MEP Brando Benifei, a member of the international trade committee, said last week.Germany’s Association of the Automotive Industry warned about the prospect of rising costs for carmakers and suppliers and said it was “regrettable that there is a threat of a further escalation of the trade conflict”.Germany’s car industry is already reeling from the 25% hike in tariffs on exports to the US on top of the pre-existing 2.5%, while its steel industry is having to cope with punitive tariffs of 50%.It is understood the agreement in principle that was on Trump’s table offered potential tariff relief for any European car manufacturers with plants in the US, which included Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen along with the Swedish brand Volvo.But last week theSwedish finance minister called the agreement “really bad”while at the same time saying that some economic pain was inevitable.The EU-US trade is worth €1.4bntn a year but just three countries – Germany, Italy and Ireland, with its large multinational pharma sector – export more to the US than they import.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsFranceEuropean UnionEmmanuel MacronDonald TrumpIrelandGermanynewsShareReuse this content"

Despite launching an appeal two years ago, the funds have not been found.A fresh plea for the remaining funds comes as relations between France and the US enter a stormy period after Donald Trump’s threat to impose a 30% tariff on goods from the European Union.Emilie Beau, the executive director of theHermione-La Fayette Association, told the Guardian: “We need a generous patron and we now have very little time to find one. It has been three years in dry dock and its 1,200 tonnes of wood needs to be in sea water and not dry.View image in fullscreenA portrait of the Marquis de Lafayette.Photograph: GL Archive/Alamy“We have been dampening the hull, but this could lead to the development of even more fungus. We’re hoping that if someone comes forward with the funds, we could restart work to repair the hull in September, with a view to sailing again in 2027.”The replica of L’Hermione, which took 17 years to build and cost €26m, waslaunched in 2015andsailed to New Yorkwhere it was greeted by an enthusiastic crowd.In 1780, the original ship made the voyage to America to help the revolutionaries led by George Washington in the war of independence. Onboard was Lafayette, Louis XVI’s personal envoy to the man who would later become the first US president. Lafayette disembarked in Boston and rode to Washington’s headquarters to deliver his message of French aid to the rebels.L’Hermione – nicknamed the “Ship of Liberty” – spent two years battling the British naval blockade before returning to France. In 1793, she ran aground off western France and sank. The wreck was discovered in 1984.In 1992 a group of maritime history enthusiasts set up the Hermione-La Fayette Association to oversee the construction of a replica of the 66-metre-long ship at the former royal shipyard at Rochefort, using historic techniques but to modern standards to enable the ship to be certified to sail.The plans for L’Hermione had been lost, but her sister ship the Concorde had been captured by the British navy in the 1790s, and detailed drawings and measurements of the vessel, a jigsaw of more than 400,000 pieces of wood and iron, were found at the Admiralty in London.Unlike the original, the replica has modern navigation equipment and electric motors for manoeuvring in and out of ports. It was also fitted with showers and toilets, as opposed to a plank of wood with holes in it near the prow that the original crew would have used. The replica cannon are fake; otherwise, it would be classed as a warship and come under the control of the French navy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Obviously, we cannot do that,” Beau said. “We want to build a ship that lasts longer than they did at the time.”The association has issued a new international appeal for funds, saying it is “now or never” to save the ship.“About 10% of the hull wood was damaged; we have replaced the wood in the rear part but now we urgently need €5m to complete the work,” Beau said. “L’Hermione is a symbolic, historical ship. It is not only a chef-d’oeuvre of technical achievement but it was called the frigate of liberty and carried the values of freedom and solidarity between peoples.“Today it is a symbol of peace and humanity, and in the current difficult period our countries are going through, it represents diplomatic relations and common values. We don’t want to lose that.”Explore more on these topicsFranceHeritageEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

She is a Threat to Humanity, and should remain in the wonderful Country ofIreland, if they want her.”The threat – which lacks an obvious legal pathway and raised further questions about Trump’s use of executive power – escalated a two-decade public feud between the pair.O’Donnell moved to Ireland earlier this year after Trump won a second White House term but they have continued to trade barbs.“You are everything that is wrong with america,” O’Donnell posted on Instagram, hours after his threat. “You want to revoke my citizenship? go ahead and try, king joffrey with a tangerine spray tan i’m not yours to silence i never was.” Joffrey is a villainous king in Game of Thrones.The actor also posted a 1980s-era photograph of Trump with Jeffrey Epstein, amidrenewed attentionon the president’s relationship with the disgraced financier.Explore more on these topicsCultureIrelandDonald TrumpSocial mediaEuropeDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

I am sorry,” he said, when asked about the planslaid outby Israel Katz last week. Once inside, Palestinians would not be allowed to leave, except to go to other countries, Katz said.Katz has ordered the military to start drawing up operational plans for construction of the “humanitarian city” on the ruins of southernGaza, to house initially 600,000 people and eventually the entire Palestinian population.“If they [Palestinians] will be deported into the new ‘humanitarian city’, then you can say that this is part of an ethnic cleansing. It hasn’t yet happened,” Olmert said. That would be “the inevitable interpretation” of any attempt to create a camp for hundreds of thousands of people, he said.Olmert did not consider Israel’s current campaign was ethnic cleansing because, he said, evacuating civilians to protect them from fighting was legal under international law, and Palestinians had returned to areas where military operations had finished.The “humanitarian city” project is backed by Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Israel’s refusal to withdraw from the area Katz envisages for the camp is a sticking point in thefaltering negotiationsfor a ceasefire deal, Israeli media have reported.Olmert said that after months of violent rhetoric, including calls from ministers to “cleanse” Gaza and projects to build Israeli settlements there, government claims that the “humanitarian city” aimed to protect Palestinians were not credible.View image in fullscreenOlmert, who led Israel from 2006 to 2009, called extremist cabinet ministers ‘the enemy from within’.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The Guardian“When they build a camp where they [plan to] ‘clean’ more than half of Gaza, then the inevitable understanding of the strategy of this [is that] it is not to save [Palestinians].

There is no other understanding that I have, at least.”Israeli human rights lawyers and scholarshave describedthe plan as a blueprint for crimes against humanity andsome have warnedthat if implemented, “under certain conditions it could amount to thecrime of genocide”.Israeli defence minister’s Gaza proposal marks escalation from incitement of war crimes to official planning for mass forced displacementRead moreOther Israelis who have described the planned “humanitarian city” as a concentration camp have been attacked for invoking comparisons to Nazi Germany, when the government says it is designed to protect Palestinians. Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust memorial centre,accused one journalistof “a serious and inappropriate distortion of the meaning of the Holocaust”.Olmert, who led Israel from 2006 to 2009, spoke to the Guardian on the day funerals were held in the occupied West Bank for two Palestinian men, one an American citizen, who had beenkilled by Israeli settlers.The latest deaths came after a campaign of violent intimidation that has forced the residents of several villagesto flee their homesover the past two years.The attacks were war crimes, Olmert said. “[It is] unforgivable. Unacceptable. There are continuous operations organised, orchestrated in the most brutal, criminal manner by a large group.”The attackers are often called “hilltop youth” in Israel and described as fringe extremists. Olmert said he preferred the term “hilltop atrocities” to describe the young men whose campaign of spiralling violence was carried out with near-total impunity.“There is no way that they can operate in such a consistent, massive and widespread manner without a framework of support and protection which is provided by the [Israeli] authorities in the [occupied Palestinian] territories,” he said.Olmert described extremist cabinet ministers who backed violence in Gaza and the West Bank – where they have authorised major settlement expansions and control law enforcement with a view to expanding the borders of Israel – as a greater threat to the country’s long-term security than any external foe. “These guys are the enemy from within,” he said.Extreme suffering in Gaza and settler atrocities in the West Bank were fuelling growing anger against Israel that cannot all be written off as antisemitism, Olmert said.“In the United States there is more and more and more expanding expressions of hatred to Israel,” he said. “We make a discount to ourselves saying: ‘They are antisemites.’ I don’t think that they are only antisemites, I think many of them are anti-Israel because of what they watch on television, what they watch on social networks.“This is a painful but normal reaction of people who say: ‘Hey, you guys have crossed every possible line.’”Attitudes inside Israel might start to shift only when Israelis started to feel the burden of international pressure, he said, calling for stronger international intervention in the absence of serious political opposition at home. He also criticised the Israeli media for its failure to report on violence against Palestinians.View image in fullscreenOlmert said he could not refrain ‘from accusing this government of being responsible for war crimes’.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianOlmert backed the initial campaign against Hamas after the 7 October 2023 attacks. But he said that, by this spring, when the Israeli government “publicly and in a brutal manner” abandoned negotiations for a permanent end to fighting, he had reached the conclusion his country was committing war crimes.“Ashamed and heartbroken” that a war of self-defence had become something else, he decided to speak out. “What can I do to change the attitude, except for number one, recognising these evils, and number two, to criticise them and to make sure the international public opinion knows there are [other] voices, many voices in Israel?” he asked.He attributed what he called war crimes to negligence and a willingness to tolerate unconscionable levels of death and devastation, rather than an organised campaign of brutality. “[Did commanders] give an order? Never,” Olmert said.Instead, he believes the military looked away when things were done that would inevitably “cause the killing of a large number of non-involved people”. He said: “That is why I cannot refrain from accusing this government of being responsible for war crimes committed.”Despite the devastation in Gaza, as the last Israeli premier to seriously attempt to reach a negotiated solution with Palestinians, Olmert still hopes that a two-state solution is possible.He is working with the former Palestinian foreign minister Nasser al-Kidwa to push for one internationally, and even believes that a historic settlement could be in reach – an end to the war in Gaza in exchange for normalisation of ties with Saudi Arabia – if only Netanyahu was able or willing to take it.Instead Olmert was stunned to see Netanyahu, a man who has an arrest warrant for war crimes from the international criminal court,nominating Donald Trumpfor a Nobel peace prize.Additional reporting by Quique KierszenbaumExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warWar crimesPalestinian territoriesEhud OlmertBenjamin NetanyahuHuman rightsIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

About 20 children and 14 adults were lined up when the strike occurred, Ramadan Nassar, who lives in the area, told the Associated Press. Al-Awda hospital received 10 bodies, including six children, health officials said.The Israel Defense Forces said a “technical error” caused a strike aimed at an Islamic Jihad “terrorist” to fall dozens of metres from the target, and that the incident was under review.The nine people killed in the separate strike on the home in Zawaida also included children.The 31 Palestinians shot dead on Saturday were on their way to a distribution site run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an Israeli-backed logistics group, near Rafah in southern Gaza, according to hospital officials and witnesses.1:33Palestinians mourn people killed while waiting for food near Rafah aid centre – videoThe Red Cross said its field hospital recorded its largest influx of dead in more than a year of operation after the shootings, and that the overwhelming majority of the more than 100 people injured had gunshot wounds.The 21-month war has left much of Gaza’s population of more than 2 million reliant on outside aid, and food security experts have warned of famine. Israel blocked and then restricted aid entry after ending the latest ceasefire in March.Nearly 800 killed at Gaza food hubs and aid convoy routes since end of May, UN saysRead more“All responsive individuals reported they were attempting to access food distribution sites,” the Red Cross said after the shootings near Rafah, noting the “alarming frequency and scale” of such mass casualty incidents.It was not possible to independently verify the numbers as Israel does not allow foreign journalists into Gaza. On Friday, the UN saidalmost 800 people had been killedseeking food at distribution points operated by the GHF and other humanitarian convoys since the end of May.Israel’s military said it had fired warning shots toward people it said were behaving suspiciously to prevent them from approaching. It said it was not aware of any casualties. The GHF said no incident had occurred near its sites.Abdullah al-Haddad said he was 200 metres from the aid distribution site run by the GHF, close to the Shakoush area, when an Israeli tank started firing at crowds of Palestinians, the Associated Press reported. “We were together, and they shot us at once,” he said, in agony from a leg wound at Nasser hospital.View image in fullscreenPalestinian children at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, Gaza, mourn loved ones who were killed by Israeli fire while seeking aid.Photograph: Ramadan Abed/ReutersMohammed Jamal al-Sahloo, another witness, said Israel’s military had ordered them to proceed to the site when the shooting started.Meanwhile in the West Bank funerals were held on Sunday for two Palestinians reportedly killed by Israeli settlers. Sayfollah Musallet, 20, a Palestinian-American said to be originally from Florida,died after being beaten, and his companion Mohammed al-Shalabi died after being shot in the chest, Palestinian health officials said.There have been no signs of a breakthrough in ceasefire talks after meetings last week between the US president, Donald Trump, and the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump had said he was nearing an agreement between Israel and Hamas, based on a new US-backed ceasefire proposal, that would potentially wind down the war.View image in fullscreenPalestinians are brought to al-Ahli Baptist hospital for medical treatment after an Israeli attack in Gaza City on Saturday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesWitnesses, health officials and UN officials say hundreds have been killed by Israeli fire while heading toward GHF distribution points through military zones. The Israeli military has acknowledged firing warning shots at Palestinians who it said approached its forces in a suspicious manner. The GHF denies there has been violence in or around its sites.The UN and other aid groups say they have struggled to distribute humanitarian aid because of Israeli military restrictions and a breakdown of law and order that has led to widespread looting.The indirect talks over the US proposal for a 60-day ceasefire continued on Saturday, an Israeli official told Reuters, seven days since talks began. One Palestinian source told Agence France-Presse that Israel’s refusal to accept Hamas’s demand for a complete withdrawal of troops from Gaza was holding back progress in the talks.A second source said mediators had asked both sides to postpone discussions until the US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, arrived in the Qatari capital.The first source said: “Hamas’s delegation will not accept the Israeli maps … as they essentially legitimise the reoccupation of approximately half of the Gaza Strip and turn Gaza into isolated zones with no crossings or freedom of movement.”View image in fullscreenA man hugs the body of a dead loved one at Nasser hospital after an Israeli attack on al-Mawasi in Gaza on Saturday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesA senior Israeli political official claimed later it was Hamas who had rejected what was on the table, accusing the group of “creating obstacles” and “refusing to compromise” with the aim of “sabotaging the negotiations”.Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people and abducted 251 in their 7 October 2023 attack on Israel that triggered the war. Hamas still holds 50 hostages, of whom at least 20 are believed to be alive.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Israel has said that recognition would be seen as areward for Hamas terrorism.The conference originally slated for June was postponed when the Israeli attack on Iran created a security crisis across the Middle East. The conference has a set of working parties that are designed to ease the path to a two-state solution, including plans for future Palestinian governance, economic renewal and challenging the narratives of hate.Nearly 60 Labour MPs call for UK to immediately recognise Palestinian stateRead moreFrench sources insisted decisions on recognition had not been made, and a subsequent event in Paris would provide the platform.Recognition was discussed last week at the Anglo-French summit, where Macron made two public appeals without setting a timetable. Macron called for recognition in his speech to UK parliamentarians and in his closing press conference. “WithGazain ruin and the West Bank being attacked on a daily basis, the perspective of a Palestinian state has never been put at risk as it is,” he told MPs.“And this is why this solution of the two states and the recognition of the state of Palestine is … the only way to build peace and stability for all in the whole region.”The joint declaration issued by Macron and the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, simply reaffirmed their commitment to “recognising a Palestinian state, as a contribution to a peace process”. And they pledged to “work together to support its development and the realisation of a two-state solution”.Le Monde reported at the weekend that neither Macron nor the crown prince ofSaudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, would attend the UN conference, and that the summit would instead be led by foreign ministers.That does not preclude Macron making his long-trailed announcement at a different point. The French preference has been to make the historic recognition announcement jointly with the UK, and possibly Canada.Speaking about the issue at length to parliament’s foreign affairs select committee, the UK foreign secretary,David Lammy, referred to the country’s role in shaping the Middle East through the Balfour declaration, saying: “I would prefer that the United Kingdom is part of a process, particularly if you look at the history, including our relationship with Balfour and the two communities that were effectively brought together at the birth of the Israeli state.”He added: “A ceasefire might be the beginning of a process, and I suspect that our French colleagues are also waiting to see whether there is a ceasefire in the next few days. That would be the beginning of something, particularly if it is a permanent ceasefire and not a pause.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Frankly, I commend my Saudi counterparts for holding true to that,” he told MPs.Separately, foreign ministers from Israel and Palestine are expected to attend a dinner in Brussels on Monday.The Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, and his Palestinian counterpart, Varsen Aghabekian, have both confirmed their attendance at an EU-Southern Neighbourhood ministerial meeting, but it is not clear if they will meet or talk to one another. The aim of the Brussels meeting is to strengthen relations between the EU and its 10 partner countries in the Mediterranean region.Explore more on these topicsEmmanuel MacronUnited NationsPalestinian territoriesIsraelGazaIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The other pilot responded that he did not do so,” the report reads.The London-bound Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed into a medical college shortly after taking off from Ahmedabad airport on 12 June, killing 241 people on board.Another 19 people died on the ground and 67 were seriously injured.The cousin of sisters Dhir and Heer Baxi, who were flying home to London after surprising their grandmother for her birthday and died in the crash, said he was not satisfied by the report.Ishan Baxi, who lives in Ahmedabad, said: “We’re still hoping for a more transparent and honest investigation that doesn’t shy away from addressing possible mechanical flaws or lapses in protocol to avoid future potential accidents.“I just hope the final report brings full clarity on what exactly failed and who’s accountable. It shouldn’t hide behind vague terms.“More than anything, it should push for real changes so this never happens again.”Relatives of Akeel Nanabawa, his wife, Hannaa Vorajee, and their four-year-old daughter, Sara Nanabawa, who died in the crash, said in a statement that the report was “the first stepping stone” and that the family were still “working our way through the weight of our loss”.“Moving forwards, we require honesty, transparency and an unwavering commitment to uncovering the full truth,” they said.“We seek justice and answers, both of which are essential for us to find any sense of closure. We accept God’s fate, but knowing what happened will help ease our hearts and allow us to begin the long journey of healing.“Above all, we hope that by pursuing the truth, no other family will ever have to endure the shock, uncertainty, and profound sorrow that we have lived through this past month.”A lawyer advising some of the families affected by the crash said the findings were deeply concerning.Demetrius Danas, an aviation lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, said: “We’re continuing to speak with and advise families who’ve been affected by the Air India crash. Understandably, all they want is to be provided with answers.”Fifty-two British nationals were killed, making it one of the deadliest plane crashes in terms of the number of British fatalities.The preliminary report says all crew members were breathalysed on their arrival at Ahmedabad airport and found to be “fit to operate the flight”.‘Why did he cut off?’: what the report on the Air India Flight 171 crash foundRead moreNo significant bird activity was detected near the flight path and the aircraft started to lose altitude before crossing the airport perimeter wall.Investigators have identified “components of interest for further examinations”, the report says.Fuel samples taken from tanks used to refuel the aircraft were “satisfactory”.The UK transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said on Sunday that she had confidence in the investigation. “We stand ready to assist the Indian authorities if they require that from us,” she said.Asked whether she thought Indian authorities were doing a good job getting to the bottom of the causes of the crash, she said: “On the basis of what I have seen so far, yes, but we do stand ready to provide any assistance. The US National Transportation Safety Board is also involved on an ongoing basis.”An Air India spokesperson said: “Air India is working closely with stakeholders, including regulators. We continue to fully cooperate with the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau and other authorities as their investigation progresses.”Explore more on these topicsAir India Ahmedabad plane crashPlane crashesIndiaAir transportSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The trade body the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) said last week it expected pub closures ata rate of more than one a day during 2025, adding to the 350 net closures during 2024. It said business rates were a factor in those closures.The industry argues that the current system, based on the rateable value of the property, means businesses must pay the tax even when they are losing money. The crucial valuation on which rates are based is “fair maintainable turnover”, a measure that looks at how much a pub should expect to sell in a year, without necessarily taking into account changes to costs.Pubs also tend to occupy high-value buildings, while being run on very tight profit margins, meaning business rates bills can be much larger than might be expected.“Pubs are going to be around for the long term, but we need to address the unfairness in the system to allow them to flourish,” he said.“It isn’t fair that the sector has 0.4% of the rateable property but pays 2.1% of the bills. The sector is a massive employer and incredibly important for local communities, so we just feel it is important to underline how beneficial it is to tax pubs fairly.”Greene King, which runs 2,600 pubs, restaurants and hotels, reported a loss of £147m before tax in its 2024 financial year. It said that pubs faced a layering of unavoidable costs that were changing the economics of the sector, making it more difficult to survive. Those costs included the impact ofincreases to employers’ national insurance contributionsimposed in the October budget by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves. Unlike corporation tax, the national insurance measure does not take account of profitability, adding to costs even for heavily loss-making pubs.Business rates costs for pubs increased this year. Along with other hospitality businesses, they were given 75% relief from business rates during the coronavirus pandemic, but Reeves cut the relief to 40% in the budget in October.More than252,000 shops, cafes, pubs, restaurantsand other hospitality businesses such as bowling alleys were affected by the change, according to estimates by the consultant Altus Group. It said the change would impose extra costs of £545m on the sector.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The king first suggested the possibility of a second such eventin February, delivered in the form of a letter by Keir Starmer during a meeting in the White House.The dates of the trip, however, avoid the prospect of the US president making an address to parliament.Other presidents, including Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, have made speeches to both houses of parliament, while the French president, Emmanuel Macron,did so last weekduring his first state visit. A Trump speech was likely to prove controversial, however, with some MPs having urged the House of Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, to refuse the US president the honour.Last week 15 Labour MPs and five others signeda parliamentary motioncalling on the speakers of both houses not to allow Trump to give a speech during the state visit. The MPs, who include Diane Abbott, Kate Osborne and Nadia Whittome, accused the president of “misogyny, racism and xenophobia”, criticising “his previous comments on women, refugees and torture”, as well as his stance on Ukraine.Peter Mandelson, the US ambassador, told the Sunday Times this weekend he believed Trumpshould be welcomed warmly on this visit.“He should expect a warm reception because he really does love Britain. He hugely admires it,”he said. “He trusts Keir Starmer. It’s not a question of expressing our gratitude. My lodestar here is to demonstrate respect, not sycophancy. I don’t think the administration has any problem with that.”Starmer has forged a productive relationship with Trump since coming to office,persuading the US presidentto lower tariffs on certain British goods, such as cars and aerospace equipment.But the prime minster is looking to secure further concessions, especially on steel exports. Steel and aluminium products are covered by the trade deal signed between the two men but are still subject to tariffs while the US administration asks further questions about UK supply chains.Mandelson told the Sunday Times the “universal 10% tariff” was unlikely to change, but added there was “scope” for negotiations in different sectors and industries, such as technology.Trump is a known admirer of the royal family, previously posting on his Truth Social platform: “I Love King Charles.” But even with the royal seal of approval and the possibility of a parliamentary address having been averted, the president’s visit provides ample opportunity for controversy.When he last visited the UK, tens of thousands of people protested against him on the streets of London. Trump responded with a social media tirade against the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, calling the Labour politician a “stone cold loser”.Trump also earned criticism for appearing to walk in front of the queen in what was interpreted as a breach of royal protocol.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpKing Charles IIIMonarchyHouse of CommonsnewsShareReuse this content"

Councils in Wales have thepower to quadruple taxes on second homes, whileEnglish councils can double taxes.The number of country houses coming on to the market was 9% higher in the second quarter of the year compared with last year.“Prices are correcting and as a result activity is noticeably picking up,” said James Cleland, the head of the country business at Knight Frank. “June was busy, and a number of deals were agreed in all price brackets, which means the next few months look even better for exchanges. It’s all about pricing. If you get it right, buyers pounce but if you get it wrong, not a lot happens.”Covid lockdowns prompted a wave of people to decide to move away from cities in favour of countryside homes five years ago – a trend that resulted in a“race for space” across the housing market.Demand, however, subsequently cooled. Average country house prices fell 3.5% in the three months to June, according to the estate agent’s price index. That was faster than the 1.6% decline in the year to March.Other factors in the glut of rural homes coming to market were a stock overhang caused by March’s stamp duty cliff edge, and buyers reactivating plans put on hold last year as a result of the political upheaval.Knight Frank said there were only 5.9 potential buyers for every new instruction to sell a country house, compared with nearly 19 at the peak of the pandemic exodus from cities. The last time buyers were in such a strong negotiating position was in the second quarter of 2018, during the turmoil over the UK’s Brexit deal with the EU under Theresa May’s Conservative government, it added.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The blaze has forced officials to close access to that area for the season.The Grand Canyon Lodge, the only lodging inside the park at the North Rim, was consumed by the flames, park superintendent Ed Keable told park residents, staff and others in a meeting Sunday morning. He said the visitor center, the gas station, a waste water treatment plant, an administrative building and some employee housing also were lost.Two wildfires are burning at or near the North Rim, known as the White Sage fire and the Bravo Dragon fire, and have collectively burned more than 45,000 acres. The White Sage fire burned 40,126 acres (16,200 hectares) near the North Rim, while the Dragon Bravo fire, burning to the south within Grand Canyon national park, reached 5,000 acresaccording to InciWeb, a federal government wildfire tracker.The Bravo Dragon fire is the one that impacted the lodge and other structures. The park initially was managing it as a controlled burn but then shifted to suppression as it rapidly grew, fire officials said. It was sparked by lightning on 4 July.No injuries have been reported.After a thunderstorm on 9 July, the US Bureau of Land Management began receiving reports of smoke in the area of the White Sage fire.Wildfires force evacuations at two national parks in the US westRead moreOn Friday, the Coconino county sheriff’s office reported that the whole region was under evacuation and urged residents to leave immediately.Millions of people visit Grand Canyon national park annually, with most going to the more popular South Rim. The North Rim is open seasonally. It was evacuated last Thursday because of wildfire and will remain closed for the rest of the season, a park statement read.The burning of the water treatment plant resulted in the release of chlorine gas that prompted the evacuation of firefighters and hikers from the inner canyon, park officials said Sunday. Chlorine gas is heavier than air and can quickly settle into lower elevations such as the inner canyon, posing a health risk.Rafters on the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon also were told to bypass Phantom Ranch, which has a set of cabins and dormitories along the river.The Grand Canyon Lodge was often the first prominent feature that visitors see, even before viewing the canyon. A highway ends at the lodge, which was known for its sloped roof, huge ponderosa beams and massive limestone facade. By walking across the lobby and descending a stairwell, visitors could get their first view of the Grand Canyon shining through windows across the sun room.“It just feels like you’re a pioneer when you walk through there [the lodge],” said Tim Allen, a longtime resident of Flagstaff,Arizona, and yearly visitor to the Grand Canyon. “It really felt like you were in a time gone by.”Aramark, the company that operated the lodge, said all employees and guests were safely evacuated.“As stewards of some our country’s most beloved national treasures, we are devastated by the loss,” said spokesperson Debbie Albert.An original lodge burned down from a kitchen fire in 1932, four years after construction was completed, according to the Grand Canyon Historical Society. The redesigned lodge using the original stonework opened in 1937.Meanwhile, officials reported progress in battling a second wildfire burning north of the Grand Canyon. Fire lines on the White Sage Fire that forced evacuations at the North Rim and in the community of Jacob Lake were holding, officials said. On the southern edge of the fire, hand crews and bulldozers were working uphill, and the spread of the blaze had been minimal.But to the east and north, the fire has spread rapidly, with grasses and standing dead trees contributing to the fire’s intensity, officials said. The fire was pushing downhill toward the Vermilion Cliffs area, and crews were assessing opportunities to create buffer zones that help slow or halt the fire’s progress.Explore more on these topicsUS wildfiresNational parksArizonaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Authorities believe more than 160 people may still be missing in Kerr county.In Kerrville, where local officials have come under scrutiny about the warnings given to residents, authorities went door to door to some homes after midnight early on Sunday to alert people that flooding was again possible. Authorities also pushed alerts to the phones of those in the area.Astatementput out by Kerrville city officials urged residents to not attempt to travel unless they are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order.Texas Hill Country under flood watch as search continues for missing peopleRead more“Please keep watch on low-water crossings and seek higher ground if flooding begins. Turn around, don’t drown!” the city officials added.According tonew alerts put out by the National Weather Service, the flash flood risk continues this morning across portions of the Texas Hill Country.“The extent and magnitude of the event has lowered from what occurred last night into the early morning hours, however some additional flash flood impacts are likely ... and localized significant impacts remain possible,” the NWS said.It alsowarnedearlier this morning that a flash flood warning was in effect for western Llano and north-western Gillespie, with significant rain having fallen and flooding expected particularly over Llano county.Similarly, a flash flood warningremainsin effect for Buchanan Dam, Buchanan Lake and Valley Spring until 3.45pm CT,as well as forWatson and Briggs until 4pm CT.As part of its warnings, the NWS has urged residents to move immediately to higher ground, as well as avoid walking or driving through flood waters.Ingram fire department officials ordered search crews to immediately evacuate the Guadalupe River corridor in Kerr county until further notice, warning the potential for a flash flood is high. Search-and-rescue efforts were expected to resume on Monday, depending on river flow, fire department spokesperson Brian Lochte said.“We’re working with a few crews and airboats and SAR (search-and-rescue) boats just in case,” Lochte said.As heavy rain fell on Sunday, National Weather Service forecasters warned that the Guadalupe River could rise to nearly 15ft (4.6 meters) by Sunday afternoon, about 5ft above flood stage and enough to put the Highway 39 bridge under water in Hunt, the small town whereCamp Mysticis located along the river.“Numerous secondary roads and bridges are flooded and very dangerous,” a weather service warning said.Texas floods: death toll reaches at least 120 people as recovery efforts continueRead moreThe rains were also causing other waterways to swell farther north inTexas, where emergency crews rescued one motorist who was left stranded in waist-high rapids on a submerged bridge over the Bosque River. The man leaned onto the vehicle for support as crews tried to reach him with life jackets.“He drove into it and didn’t realize how deep it was,” said Jeff Douglas, the president of the McGregor volunteer fire department. “Luckily he was able to stand next to the vehicle.”Under heavy rain, Matthew Stone was clearing branches and a log from a storm sewer in front of his home on Guadalupe Street in Kerrville on Sunday as several inches of water pooled up on the road.Multiple houses on the street overlooking the Guadalupe River were severely impacted by the 4 July floods, and Stone had to pull his older neighbors from their home before water overtook it. He said he felt safe nor now.“My wife was freaking out, that’s for sure, but as long as that river is not coming down, we’ll be all right,” he said. “The cops have been coming back and forth, we’re getting lots of alerts, we’re getting a lot of support.”Just before daybreak on the Fourth of July, the destructive, fast-moving waters rose 26ft on the Guadalupe River, washing away homes and vehicles. Ever since, searchers have used helicopters, boats and drones to look for victims and to rescue people stranded in trees and from camps isolated by washed-out roads.The floods laid waste to the Hill Country region of Texas. The riverbanks and hills of Kerr County are filled with vacation cabins, youth camps and campgrounds, including Camp Mystic, the century-old, all-girls Christian summer camp.Located in a low-lying area along the Guadalupe River in a region known as flash flood alley, Camp Mystic lost at least 27 campers and counselors.The flood was far more severe than the 100-year event envisioned by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), experts said, and moved so quickly in the middle of the night that it caught many off guard in a county that lacked a warning system.Trump wants to ‘remake’ Fema, not eliminate it, Kristi Noem saysRead moreThe sheer amount of rain was overwhelming. Former Noaa chief scientist Ryan Maue, a private meteorologist, calculated on 5 July that the storm had dropped 120bn gallons of water on Kerr county, which received the brunt of the storm.On Sunday, Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said that Donald Trump wants to have the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema)“remade”instead of eradicated entirely.Speaking to NBC, Noem defended theTrump administration’s response to the deadly Texas floods that have killed at least 120 people, saying: “I think the president recognizes that Fema should not exist the way that it always has been.

It needs to be redeployed in a new way, and that’s what we did during this response.”Noem added: “I think he wants it to be remade so that it’s an agency that is new in how it deploys and supports states.”Trump cuts questioned as role of Fema in Texas highlights agency’s importance in natural disaster responseRead moreHer comments follow widespread criticism of the Trump administration’s handling of the Texas floods asreportsemerged of thousands of calls from flood survivors being left unanswered by Fema’s call centers due to unextended contracts.Earlier this week, the New York Timesreportedthat Fema did not answer nearly two-thirds of calls to its disaster assistance line. The outlet also reported that Noem, who implemented a new policy that she personally signs off on contracts over $100,000, did not renew the contracts until five days after they expired in the middle of the floods.Noem decried the reports as “fake news”, saying: “That report needs to be validified. I’m not certain it’s accurate, and I’m not sure where it came from, and the individuals who are giving you information out of Fema, I’d love to have them put their names behind it because the anonymous attacks to politicize the situation is completely wrong.”Noem went on to acknowledge her policy of personally signing off on contracts worth more than $100,000, saying: “It’s not extra red tape, it’s making sure everything is getting to my level, and that it’s immediately responded to.”She also praised Fema’s response as the “best response” in years to the Texas floods, saying: “This response was by far the best response we’ve seen out of Fema, the best response we’ve seen out of the federal government in many, many years, and certainly much better than what we saw under Joe Biden.”Despite Noem’s defense of the agency and the Trump administration’s handling of the crisis, many have criticized Fema as the downsized agency has seen approximately 2,000 resignations and retirements since Trump’s inauguration.Speaking to the Guardian, Michael Coen, Fema’s former chief of staff,said:“I’m concerned that Fema is going to be at a disadvantage because they don’t have the resources to respond to the disasters we know could happen, which could be two or three concurrent disasters at the same time.“Fema has eroded capacity since President Trump became president. Staff have departed. There have been cuts to grant programs and they are going to be running into a financial challenge with the disaster relief fund, because the president hasn’t requested supplemental funding from Congress.”Trump defends Texas flood handling as disaster tests vow to shutter FemaRead moreSince taking office, Trump has routinely threatened to disband the agency which was set up by Jimmy Carter in 1979 following states’ struggle to handle major disasters. In June, Trump said that he planned to start“phasing out”Fema after hurricane season and that states would receive federal aid to respond to natural disasters.“We’re going to give out less money,” Trump said.Last month, Noem alsosaidthat Fema “fundamentally needs to go away as it exists”, adding that states should have more responsibility when handling natural disasters.However, since the Texas floods, which mark Trump’s first major natural disaster since taking office in January, his administration’s rhetoric on eliminating Fema has appeared to shift.Earlier this week, upon being asked whether he still plans to phase out the agency, Trumpsaidit was a matter “we can talk about later”. Similarly, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters that the federal government’s response to natural disasters was a “policy discussion that will continue”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpKristi NoemNatural disastersTexas floods 2025US politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

One rally-goer, Corey Comperatore, was killed before the shooter, a 20-year-old nursing-home worker from Pennsylvania named Thomas Matthew Crooks, was shot dead by a Secret Service agent. Crooks scaled a building overlooking the rally and opened fire using anAR015-style rifle.Blood and bravado: the Trump shooting upended an election and shook the USRead moreThe image of Trump defiantly raising his fist in the immediate aftermath of the attack became a politicaltouchstone, helping push Joe Biden out of the race and fuelling support around his presidency in a heightened, accelerated manner.The committee behind this latest report, chaired by Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, conducted 17 interviews with members of theSecret Serviceand reviewed thousands of legal documents before it reached its conclusion. While it offers no new information on Crooks’s motives, which are still ambiguous almost a year on, it does shine light on the supposed disorganization and disarray of the security agency as the assassination unfolded.The investigators found that the Secret Service “denied or left unfulfilled” multiple requests for additional staff and assets, and despite acknowledgements of vulnerabilities at the venue, assigned an inexperienced operator to oversee operations.“What happened was inexcusable,” the committee stated, adding that “the consequences imposed for the failures so far do not reflect the severity of the situation.”Six Secret Service agents havesince been suspendedwithout pay after the events last July. Their suspensions range from 10 to 42 days, with a loss of both salary and benefits during their absence.This disciplinary action comes nearly a year after the shooting. The agency’s deputy director, Matt Quinn, told CBS News that the Secret Service would not “fire our way out of this” crisis.Explore more on these topicsSecret ServiceDonald Trump Pennsylvania rally shootingUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

How did we get here?Home prices and mortgage rates remain high years after the peak pandemic housing boom. It’s unclear when relief will come – and asDonald Trump’s erratic policies on trade and the economy heightens uncertainty, economists fear the consequences may be felt for a generation.Chart showing estimated first time homebuyers from 1990 to 2024, showing that 2024 was a multi-decade lowFor young Americans, holding off on buying a home has become the new norm. Last year, the average age of a first-time homebuyer was 38 years old, a record high, according to theNAR. In the 1980s, the average was in the late 20s.Buying a home later in life typically has ripple effects, according to Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin.“It probably means they’re going to be retiring later, because when you buy a home, you’re setting up for a 30-year-mortgage,” she said. “People are finding that they’re going to have to work longer basically to achieve these goals.”The highs and lows of the property market are closely tied to interest rates set by the US Federal Reserve. Interest rates currently sit between 4.25% to 4.5%, about 1% lower than they were this time last year. But mortgage rates are still above 6.5%, nearly double what they were five years ago.The housing market has felt the strain, with high mortgage rates suppressing the number of people able to buy their first homes.Typically, when demand drops, prices follow. But even when the number of buyers dropped, prices kept climbing. The median price of a single-family home hit record highs in 2024, and has only continued going up. In May, the median price was $427,800 – up from $357,100 in 2021, when home prices started to climb.At today’s prices, a family would need to earn $126,700 a year to afford monthly payments on an average home purchased in 2024, up from $79,300 annually in 2021, according to areportfrom the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies.Economists say a historically low inventory of existing homes, coupled with sluggish new construction, is keeping prices high.And potential new homeowners are faced with a dilemma: renting is now significantly cheaper than buying.Analysisfrom John Burns Research and Consulting found that buying an entry-level home now costs twice as much as renting an apartment, for the first time since 2006.That’s made the current housing market difficult for both buyers and sellers. And sellers are increasingly struggling to find buyers willing to take on higher mortgage rates.Given interest rates’ impact on the housing market, Trump has repeatedlydemandedthat the Fed lower them. “You have cost the USA a fortune and continue to do so,” Trump told the central bank’s chair, Jerome Powell, in a handwritten note.But Powell and other Fed officialsarguethat Trump’s tariffs have created ongoing economic uncertainty, especially around prices. Some consumers say they’ve alreadyseen prices rise, and cutting rates risks fueling more inflation.“It’s a risk we feel. As the people who are supposed to keep stable prices, we need to manage that risk,” Powelltoldthe US Senate last month.Few expect marked improvements in the housing market anytime soon. Economists say caution from the Fed will continue to affect the housing market.Buyers, including existing homeowners, are “waiting for interest rates to drop or for prices to correct”, said Fairweather of Redfin. “What we’re hearing is that the overall economic uncertainty makes people not want to commit to a mortgage right now.”"

For Brics, heft matters. It now counts 11 member states – includingIndonesia, which joined this year – representing half the world’s population and40%of the global economy,outpacingthe G7 by $20tn.Yet its size hides its contradictions. The grouping’s call for moreinclusiveglobal institutions sounds welcome, but there is a preponderance ofautocracieswithin its own ranks. Brics is right thatinternational lawshould be upheld in Middle Eastern conflicts. But it climbs down from its moral pedestal bycondemningUkraine’s strikes on Russian infrastructure – while staying silent on Moscow’s relentless attacks on civilians.The acronym “Bric” – Brazil, Russia, India and China (South Africa wouldn’t join until 2010) – began as a Wall Streetbeton rising powers challenging the west. But whatdefinesBrics today is a subtler, more strategic ambition: to insulate themselves from Washington’s gravitational pull while cooperating to build a joint hi-tech industrial base. There are things that the Brics get right. Financial global institutions such as theInternational Monetary Fundare in need of reform; the rich world has failed tohonourclimate finance promises. The group’s understandable response in the face of inaction is to create its owndevelopment bankto promote a form of green industrialisation.A pre-summitagreementon a formal collective Brics stance on funding climate action will help. Rapid growth in renewable energy means fossil fuels now account forless than halfof the bloc’s total electricity generation. Given the climate emergency, such progress can only be welcome. Brics memberstatesnow lead ingreen techand boast booming consumer markets – offering both the tools and the scale to drive industrial growth.The postwar order stood on three pillars: US dominance, hydrocarbons and open trade. Today, all three are cracking, largely because of the US itself. Many Brics nations have little to gain from backing oil when the world’sbiggest producer is the US. Donald Trump’sthreatof higher import duties on the bloc’s members speaks to the US turn against global trade. By placingtariffson Brazil over its internal politics, Mr Trump turns economic diplomacy into personal vendetta – and highlights how the rules-based order is unravelling.This moment presents both a challenge and an opening. Tariffed in the west, Chinese firms pivot to Brics. So the United Arab Emirates cashes in – winning local production and techtransfersfrom Beijing that the west won’t permit. Brics’ vision of smart, clean growth fits the gaps in the global order. But it isn’t united:Russia’sgreen potential is buried under itsfossil fuel policy.Saudi Arabiahedges – flirting with Brics while clinging to the US, with deals in the balance. Most of the group’s member states are nervous that a powerfulChinacould tower over the rest. Strikingly, however, its leader, Xi Jinping, did not attend this summit.The Brics nations can still close ranks. Their most technical yet revealing move is to start building financial “plumbing” to bypass western systems. The group isn’t ditching the dollar – but its members know what exclusion feels like: India hadcreditdenied after the 2008 crash; Iranian banks have beensanctionedsince 2012. The bloc’ssuccesswill depend not just on ambition, but on the capacity to coordinate across national interests.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Reece James lifted it, fireworks went off and Blue is the Colour went round. They had done it.Paris Saint-Germain had seemed peerless, a side that shifted the paradigm, butthe European championscould not beat Robert Sánchez at one end – the goalkeeper one of many outstanding performers – and were picked off at the other, victims of a perfect plan.This hadn’t been what PSG, or anyone, expected and at the final whistle they lost the plot, confrontations sparked on the pitch. Somewhere in the crowd, the coach Luis Enrique seemed to grab at João Pedro’s throat just as João Neves had grabbed at Marc Cucurella’s hair in the dying minutes of the match, their dreadful afternoon wrapped up with a red card.For Chelsea, it could not have gone any better, and almost from the start. Ultimately, they had won this inside 30 minutes, which is what their opponents were supposed to do.“We know that they begin games very fast, very strong,” Cucurella had said but while Ousmane Dembélé almost caught Sánchez 95 seconds in, it was Chelsea who did so. The first chance was theirs inside 10 minutes and it was so close that some in this stadium celebrated, João Pedro teeing up Palmer for a shot that bent just past the post. That, it turned out was just a sighter; next time, the MetLife could let go for real.View image in fullscreenJoão Neves (right) was sent off for pulling Marc Cucurella’s hairPhotograph: Jose Breton/NurPhoto/ShutterstockChelsea’s plan was clear: quick into the challenge, quicker to send the ball into the space behind PSG, starting with Sánchez directly from his own area. PSG might have led early when Désiré Doué cut back to Kvaratskhelia instead of taking the shot himself before seeing another effort stopped by a superb low save from Sánchez.It was also true that they took a degree of control in that phase and beyond, possession eventually up near 70% but Chelsea had anticipated that and the advantage was quickly theirs, 1-0 up on 22 minutes.Sánchez’s diagonal went right where Nuno Mendes, buffeted, didn’t judge the leap well. Suddenly, Malo Gusto was away, space opening on the wing before him and he cut into the area, ready to shoot. Lucas Beraldo blocked the first effort but Gusto retrieved the ball and laid into the path of Palmer who opened up his body and curled it into the bottom of the net. Off he went, holding himself.The shot with which he made it 2-0 eight minutes later was almost identical. Coming in from the right, Palmer saw Gusto fly up outside him. So, and this was the key, did the PSG defence. A slight pause, a little shuffle of the hips was enough to clear Beraldo and Marquinhos from his path and Palmer put the ball in the same square of the net. In half an hour, he had taken almost the same shot three times. Two had gone in, the other looked like it had, the title within touching distance already.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The pass was smooth, so was the finish from João Pedro, dinked over Gigi Donnarumma as if he was playing on the beach, which 10 days ago he was.Trump booed but unbowed at Club World Cup final as Chelsea lift trophyRead moreChelsea had completed only 126 passes at that point, but that was at least partly by clinical design, producing three shots clearly constructed and calmly executed, giving them a lead that wasn’t for overturning. Which isn’t to say PSG didn’t try after a 24-minute half-time. Sánchez almost immediately had to get to the feet of Fabián Ruiz and then scramble away Kvaratskhelia’s shot before making an excellent close-range stop from Dembélé.Chelsea got deeper and were not always in a hurry to get the ball back. When they did, they tried to keep it, each pass greeted witholés, the match managed expertly. Sánchez dived to save Vitinha’s dipping effort but only rarely did Chelsea feel under the kind of pressure that would prise the trophy from their hands.In fact, if anyone was going to score again, it was Liam Delap, who twice went close, as down the on the bench the T-shirts were handed out.

In Sinner’s case, the pain he endured simply made him stronger.One month on from the toughest night of his life on a tennis court, ­Sinner turned the tables at the earliest possible opportunity, demonstrating his resilience by recovering from a set down to win his firstWimbledontitle with a phenomenal performance, toppling the two-time defending champion, Alcaraz, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 6-4.‘Living my dream’: Sinner delights in Wimbledon triumph against AlcarazRead moreSinner is the first Italian player to win a Wimbledon singles title and he now stands as a four-time grand slam champion. He breaks his­overall tie with an assortment of famous names, including Arthur Ashe, Andy Murray and Stan Wawrinka. Perhaps most important, he ends his great rival’s run of five consecutive wins against him, adding a new dimension to a rivalry that seems set to decide the majority of major tournaments in the near future.In their own personal grand slam race, which still feels like it has only just begun, Sinner’s victory ensures that Alcaraz, who owns five major titles, remains within touching distance. This is also Sinner’s first slam title away from hard courts, after two victories at the Australian Open and last year’s US Open title.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz took the first set but could not repeat his heroics of the French Open final.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianA month ago, Sinner stared blankly into space from his seat on Court Philippe-Chatrier while Alcaraz celebrated his triumph in their French Open final with his family in the stands. Sinner held three championship points, the match on his racket, in the fourth set before losing one of the greatest grand slam finals in history. It is a reflection of the Italian’s tenacity and mental strength that the 23 year-old has found his path again so quickly.This is also Sinner’s first grand slam victory and overall title since his three-month doping ban between February and May. Sinner had tested positive for the banned substance clostebol last year before successfully arguing during his initial tribunal in August that the positive test had been a result of contamination, receiving no suspension. After the World Anti-Doping Agency chose to appeal the case, Sinner’s team and Wada eventually entered a case resolution ­agreement, essentially a ­settlement, agreeing on the three-month suspension.Quick GuideHewett dethroned by Oda in men's wheelchair finalShowBritain's Alfie Hewett lost his Wimbledon title to the world No 1, Tokito Oda, after an absorbing men's wheelchair final. The 27-year-old from Norwich, who won his first Wimbledon crown last year, was beaten 3-6, 7-5, 6-2 on a packed No 1 Court.Hewett was four from four on break points as he took the first set in 33 minutes. The defending champion broke Oda again as the 19-year-old from Japan, who beat Hewett in the 2023 final, served for the second set at 5-4. But Oda broke back before holding to level the match, and then went a double break up in the decider.Hewett saved two championship points on serve and another in the next game, but Oda converted his fourth to secure his second Wimbledon title after two hours and 16 minutes.\"Last year was obviously such a special moment for me, but I don't think trophies compare to this atmosphere and this kind of support,\" said Hewett. \"Congratulations to Tokito, it was a good battle out there and it's well deserved.\"PA SportWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Their three hours on Centre Court also showcased Sinner’s toughness. Despite how he frustratingly ended the first set, he kept on moving forward. Unlike a month earlier, Sinner played his best tennis in the decisive moments, serving brilliantly under pressure in the third set and maintaining his relentless aggression until the end, smothering the Spaniard with his constant pressure. Deep in the fourth set, as he faltered, this time Sinner held on.Aside from his bizarre fourth-round match, where Sinner hurt his elbow and trailed by two sets to Grigor Dimitrov before the Bulgarian was forced to retire, Sinner had undoubtedly performed at a higher, more consistent level than Alcaraz throughout the tournament. For once, Alcaraz could not find a way back in through the sheer force of his competitive spirit.Things had not started so well for Sinner. After establishing a 4-2 lead in the first set, the Italian watched his lead evaporate as Alcaraz reeled off four consecutive games, closing it off with an angled backhand slice winner at the very end of his range.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An unfocused start to the second set immediately left him trailing 0-40 and he eventually lost his serve. While his opponent’s level wavered, Sinner regained his rhythm on serve, which had faltered at the end of the first set, then he calmly continued to put Alcaraz under pressure on every point with his relentless aggression off both wings.The essential third set was ultimately decided by their serving under pressure. While Sinner saved some of his best serving for key moments, following up a searing 117mph second-serve ace at 3-4, 30-30 with another service winner to hold, Alcaraz faltered. The Spaniard lost rhythm on his first serve at the end of the subsequent game as Sinner fearlessly connected with two ­brilliant second-serve returns, snatching the set’s decisive break.The last time Sinner led two sets to one, all hell broke loose. He found himself at a similar crossroads while leading 4-3 in the fourth set as a series of nervous unforced errors sent him down 15-40. This time, he refused to let Alcaraz back in, digging himself out of a difficult hole and into the history books with the brand of bold, destructive shot-making that reinforced his status as the best player in the world.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Jannik SinnerCarlos AlcarazWimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

McIlroy shared second with Marco Penge.“I hung in there like a champ and finished it off in style,” Gotterup said. “I was ready for the challenge, I knew I was playing well this week so I felt comfortable. I was a one-time winner on tour but two sounds much better.

Few expected Gotterup to put up much resistance but the 25-year-old was nerveless. McIlroy’s inward half of level par proved problematic as ­Gotterup came home in two under. This was, however, McIlroy’s finest tournament display since his Masters triumph.Gotterup had to withstand the extra pressure associated with being put on the clock for slow play during the closing stages of the tournament. By the 72nd tee, Gotterup was two clear. He will make his Open debut on Thursday.

Once a workaday punter with the Indianapolis Colts, McAfee is now the most influential pundit in American sports with an eponymous ESPN show, who has more than 11m followers across YouTube, X, Instagram and TikTok.To howls of merriment from his panel, McAfee spelled out the rumor centered on a 19-year-old female student at Ole Miss, a public university in Mississippi, as it was “being reported by everybody on the internet”: that the student had sex with her boyfriend’s father. “Ole Miss dads are slinging meat right now!” roared “Boston” Connor Campbell, one of McAfee’s sidekicks.The world of sports influencers [...] now stands as an important bastion of the culture of insensitivity and entitlement on which Trumpism thrivesMcAfee did not directly name Mary Kate Cornett, the college freshman at the center of the rumor, but she has sincedescribedhow McAfee’s amplification of this “completely false” story encouraged others in the sports talk world to do likewise, resulting in her receiving a deluge of threats and harassment. Cornett has engaged lawyers to explore suing McAfee, ESPN and others involved in spreading the rumor for defamation. McAfee appeared moderately chastened by the episode: “I never, ever want to be a part of anything negative in anybody’s life, ever,” hesaidrecently while addressing the outrage that his boosting of the rumor prompted. But he has not yet apologized, and in no way does his future as one of ESPN’s most bankable stars seem in jeopardy. Whatever blowback ensued has blown right on by.The whole episode served as a demonstration of power: the world of sports influencers such as McAfee, which is particularly influential among young men and can be understood as an extension of theDonald Trump-aligned “manosphere”, now stands as an important bastion of the culture of insensitivity and entitlement on which Trumpism thrives.View image in fullscreenA new generation of sports talk starsThePat McAfee Show, a two-to three-hour afternoon blast of high-volume sports chat, sweating and raw, uncomplicated American male heterosexuality, launched in 2019. It has quickly become a favored media stop for many of the top names in US sports and culture. Tom Cruisespent30 minutes on the show recently (“I appreciate the shit outta you,” McAfee told Cruise); LeBron Jamesstopped byfor an hour.Throughout the show’s history, McAfee has courted controversy: he’s called WNBA starCaitlin Clark a “white bitch”, he’s made jokes about child abuse, he’s helped air rumorslinking celebrities to Jeffrey Epstein. None of it seems to matter: McAfee, whose show moved to ESPN on a five-year, $85m deal in 2023, powers on unperturbed, growing in cultural might with each passing month.McAfee is now the avatar of a new generation of sports talk stars who have upended the rules about public speech, remade culture in their own brash image, and are completely bulletproof.View image in fullscreenPat McAfee on set before a college football game between the Washington Huskies and Indiana Hoosiers on 26 October 2024 at Memorial Stadium in Bloomington, Indiana.Photograph: Icon Sportswire/Getty ImagesAmong McAfee’s peers in this dripped-out new world of costless needling are Barstool Sports boss Dave Portnoy; former NFL players Will Compton and Taylor Lewan, who co-host the show Bussin’ With the Boys; and NFL receiver-turned-podcaster Antonio Brown. Sports are also a major, though not exclusive, topic of conversation for Joe Rogan, Theo Von and other leaders of the manosphere. The Wikipedia pages of many of these figures contain hefty “controversy” tabs. Portnoy has faced extensive andcredibleaccusationsof sexual misconduct; Brownrefersto WNBA star Clark, an athlete on whom the anti-woke rightseems psychotically fixated, as “Cousin Itt”, referencing the Addams Family’s hirsute, non-verbal relative, and is socrassly sexistonline that even the famously feminist redoubt of Barstool Sports hasdescribedhim as a “crackpot”.In an earlier era, reckless promotion of tasteless gossip about a teenager’s sex life might have been enough to sink a career like McAfee’s. Provocation, abrasiveness and a delight in offending have been essential to sports talk – on radio and cable TV – for decades. But in the years before social media, on-demand programming and betting turned sports into an all-hours, all-platforms juggernaut, there were still lines that sporting pundits could not cross: shock jock Don Imus, for instance, built his career on being outspoken but wasfiredby WFAN/MSNBC in 2007 after making racist and misogynist comments including describing the Rutgers women’s basketball team as “nappy-headed hos”.Today’s sports broadcast world runs according to a new set of rules, in which “respectable” TV and the demi-monde of sports podcasts, streaming, and shitposting increasingly intersect: all engagement is good engagement, and the best type of filter is no filter. Whatever faint norms of decorum constrained earlier generations of professional sports talkers have faded completely.There’s a reciprocal flow of testosterone and ideas between these shows, the world of sports, social media and real life. A handful of subjects and themes recur: veneration of the military, glorification of strength and traditional “male” values, celebration of gambling, the denigration of women and anything thought to represent “woke” culture. On any given day across the sporting bro-zone you might hear Bussin’ With the Boys and their guests rail againstpronounsandcancel culture, the hosts of Barstool Sports’ Pardon My Take podcastargueTaylor Swift needs to “release a sex video” to make her presence at NFL games tolerable to the average male fan, or McAfee devote 30 minutes (as hedid recently) to describing his day among “maybe the baddest motherfuckers on earth”: the drill instructors at the US Marine Corps training center on Parris Island in South Carolina. These interests and obsessions mirror the president’s cultural politics, turning the sports bros into critical emissaries for Trump’s peculiar brand of popularly elected vandalism.Broadcasts such as Pat McAfee Show are powerful engines of political orientation not because they address politics directly [...] but because their politics emerge in the interstices of everything said on screenIt’s worth questioning, of course, how influential these influencers really are. A recent poll from the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politicsfoundthat 35% of young men had an unfavorable view of Rogan, while a further 36% had never heard of him or did not know enough about him to have an opinion. The much-rehearsed idea that the minds of young male voters have been irretrievably colonized by the manosphere is surely overblown.But there seems little dispute that these influencers have been effective in platforming rightwing figures and ideas. The sports bros are an essential part of that legitimizing apparatus – all the more so because their endorsement of the right’s reflexes, priorities and modes of attack is couched in the ostensibly apolitical language of sports. The cultural supremacy of the sports bros is now so total that Barstool’s Dave Portnoy is now famous for hisonline pizza reviewsthat can make or break restaurants in America. When a casual day trader from Massachusetts who built his media empire on college gambling advice becomes the arbiter-in-chief of America’s favorite food, something fundamental has shifted in how we determine cultural authority.View image in fullscreenThe sports bro supremacyThe unsinkability of these sporting mouths, bobbing forever on the surface of our cultural consciousness, parallels the envenomation of online discourse and the transformation of Trump frompresidential punchlineinto the most consequential political figure of the century. Trump, let’s not forget, first reached the White House after navigating a storm of outrage over the Access Hollywood tape, a victory that set a precedent for the practitioners of “locker room talk” who have found fame in his wake. With the tacit endorsement of the sports bros, on whose shows he became a regular guest during last year’s election, Trump not onlyseizedthe young male vote, he also engineered a complete reversal in his own reputation throughout the sporting world from his first to second terms.Interestingly, McAfee himself declined an invitation to have Trump on his show during last year’s election campaign,reasoningthat he and his sidekicks are “not the ones” to be asking questions about politics – an uncharacteristic moment of modesty. But UFC-adjacent comedian Theo Von and Barstool Sports’ Bussin’ With the Boys both featured extended conversations with Trump during the campaign.These appearances showed Trump to be extremely well-versed in sports, which is perhaps no surprise when you consider the amount of time he spendstweetingabout them,watchingthem andplayingthem – not to mention his own tangled history with the business side of sports (Trump owned a New Jersey-based team in the short-lived United States Football League during the 1980s). These podcasts also helped humanize Trump, presenting him as a relatable guy whoworks long hoursand is sympathetic enough to engage a jumpy figure like Von in a conversation aboutdrug addiction. The warm audience Trump received helped normalize his politics and support.Today the sporting world, with a few notable exceptions, genuflects before Trump in a way that seemed unthinkable during his first term. Beyond the unquivering Trumpian stronghold of Dana White’s UFC, the big professional leagues such as the NFL and NBA either kept their distance from the 45th president or were at outright war with him; now No 47 is theguest of honorat the Super Bowl and every second athlete is doing theTrump dance, the double fist pump and minor hip swivel that the president has turned into his signature choreographic move on the campaign stage.The president’s political endurance has perhaps, in turn, acted as a kind of bro bat signal, helping to validate the obnoxiousness and resistance to introspection on which the sports bros thrive: ifhedoesn’t have to censor himself, apologize or pay lip service to feelings, why should they?View image in fullscreenDonald Trump poses with Philadelphia Eagles head coach, Nick Sirianni, and offensive tackle Lane Johnson at a White House event honoring the team after their second Super Bowl victory, on 28 April 2025 in Washington DC.Photograph: Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesThe personality of American culture has long been split between purity and profanity. The death of consequences for figures like McAfee suggests the balance of power has definitively swung in favor of the trolls and tough guys, and now none of puritanical old America’s sanctities will hold them back. It says everything about the sports bros’ invincibility that among the top names floated by progressives to counter the blitzkrieg of Trump’s second term and lead them to 2028 is Stephen A Smith, the sports pundit who turned relentlessness into a career and is something of a spiritual godfather to the McAfees and Portnoys of the world. The only person who can defeat a sports bro is another sports bro.Might there be another strategy for the left to combat this tide flooding the sporting-cultural zone? Recent reports suggest Democrats areslinging moneyto all corners of the country in a desperate attempt to find the progressive answer to Rogan: the chatter is all about“speaking with American men”and investing to generate a“return on culture”, and Democrats such as Hakeem Jeffries and Josh Shapiro have in recent monthszombiedfrom sports podcast to sports podcast in a doomed and focus group-refined attempt to revive a cadaverous Democratic party with the tonic of their everyman cool.These appearances might be wooden and inauthentic, but it does suggest a key role for sports in the left’s attempt to pull itself off the canvas following the catastrophe of last November. Sports are hardly the exclusive preserve of the right. The Golden State Warriors’ four-time championship winning head coach, Steve Kerr, is probably themost vocal critic of Trumpismat work in American sports today, and Democrats have long associated themselves with sports: Barack Obama, of course, is an accomplished hooper, while Zohran Mamdani, the socialist candidate for New York City mayor who lovesArsenalandcricketand has spun his appearances at Knicks games during the recent NBA playoffs intocampaign trail gold, is living proof that it’s possible to be passionate and knowledgeable about sports while eschewing the ugliness of bro culture.But left-leaning sports pundits? That’s a tougher ask. The pallor of recent attempts to seed a more robust progressive presence online highlights how severely Democrats have been left behind in the new world of sports talk. Broadcasts such as the Pat McAfee Show are powerful engines of political orientation not because they address politics directly – they almost never do – but because their politics emerge in the interstices of everything said on screen.Where the right is loud, the sporting left speaks with a militant squeakThere aren’t many popular voices in sports punditry that do for the left what McAfee and his cohort do, casually yet masterfully, for the right: embody an ethos, solidify an idiom and transmit a set of values that find a natural downstream outlet in electoral politics. Influential Twitch lefty Hasan Piker occasionally discusses sports but they are not his main focus; pundits such as Pablo Torre and Bomani Jones lean liberal but they do not have the same reach that the McAfees of the world do, and they don’t express their politics with anything like the same splash. Over the past decade sports broadcasters who discussed politics from a leftist perspective, such as former ESPN hostJemele Hill, were gradually forced out of the mainstream. NFL star Travis Kelce, who hosts a popular podcast with his older brother Jason, seems vaguely progressive in orientation but he alsosaidplaying in front of Trump at this year’s Super Bowl was “a great honor”, a tellingly wimpy political intervention. Like LeBron before him, he’s too big to get too real, too good to get dirty; the Kelce-James brand of progressivism is very much by the book, a progressivism of the civics class. Where the right is loud, the sporting left speaks with a militant squeak.View image in fullscreenA lack of voices on the leftOn-field athletic competition is about domination, strength, winners and losers, yes, but it’s also about finesse, beauty, cunning and wit; it’s a place where conservative fantasies of order and the cerebrations of the progressives can both find a home.But if any side should be controlling the field of sports talk, it is the left, since so many of the inequalities that plague society at large now infect sports as well, which are increasingly run on extractive lines for the benefit of predatory rentiers, autocrat-backed sovereign wealth funds andprivate-equity ghouls. Meanwhile the leveling mechanisms that still keep the American professional leagues interesting and unpredictable – collective wage bargaining, drafts, salary caps and luxury taxes – have their roots in this country’s unlikely tradition ofsporting socialism. Far from being a natural stage for the tiresome politics of cultural revenge in which the right traffics, sports (as a thing to shoot the shit about) offer a rich canvas for the exploration of many issues about which the left cares deeply: race, gender, class, social mobility and the corrupting influence of money.Sexual assault allegations seem to be a badge of honor in Trump’s America. Was #MeToo an epic failure?Read moreThe left should not be afraid of learning from the lords of the sporting bro-zone even as it spurns their machismo and lack of tact. A culture used to crew necks can’t go back to buttoned collars.For example, as part of his deal with ESPN, McAfee is allowed to swear live on TV: “The following progrum is a collection of stooges talking about happenings in the sports world,” announces a disclaimer that airs before each show, read aloud in a geriatric voice reminiscent of Grampa Simpson. “There may be some ‘cuss’ words because that’s how humans in the real world talk.” This is one area where the bros and the left should make common cause: swearing is good. Viewers love McAfee not despite the fact he’s loose, unpolished and has a dirty mouth; they love him because of these things. This is a man, let’s not forget, who first came to prominence at age 23, while playing for the Colts, after being arrested in downtown Indianapolis for taking a pre-dawn swim in a canal. Asked to explain why he was soaking wet, McAfeereplied: “I am drunk.” The charge was dismissed but the hearts of a city were won, and a media career was born.Why can the left not take the best of McAfee and his ilk while jettisoning the worst? Surely it’s possible to talk sports in a way that’s biting, real, unfiltered, funny and even mean – to “connect with men where they are”, as we are repeatedly told the left must – without descending into toxicity, cruelty, belligerence and hate. If progressives want to reclaim the White House, they could do worse than to start rambling for hours on end about games and players that have nothing to do with politics at all. Sports-loving leftists of America, unite: you have nothing to lose but your parlays."

Pogacar, the race leader, said: “There are still two weeks to go and losing a rider today is a little bit to our disadvantage, but I’m pretty confident in my team.”The high temperatures that have settled on the race are to continue on Monday and the first mountain stage, from Ennezat to Le Mont-Dore Puy de Sancy, which takes in eight classified climbs through the Auvergne.For Oscar Onley the first lengthy climbs will be a sterling test of his resilience as the 22-year-old Scot arrives in the Massif Central in seventh, less than three minutes behind Pogacar. His Picnic–PostNL sports director, Matt Winston, said: “We want to take Oscar as far as we can in the race, but we also want to do that with no pressure.“Oscar is one of six riders in this race that have come from our development team and he’s done really well in a lot of one-week races. A three-week race is a little bit of an unknown, and maybe in week two or week three we’ll see a bit of a drop off, but for now we keep fighting.”Steve Cummings is a past stage winner in the Tour’s furnace conditions. The 44-year-old, now sports director at the Jayco AlUla team, won a baking mountain stage to Mende in 2015. “I rode well in the heat, which is odd because I’m from the Wirral,” Cummings said.“There’s two things: preparation, to make sure you’re ready and managing your core temperature in the race. There’s ‘ice socks’” – tights stuffed with ice cubes, placed between the shoulder blades – “which is more perceptual than cooling the core temperature, but it makes a difference because it’s psychologically beneficial. The theory is that cooling from the inside out is quite beneficial. The challenge operationally is getting a regular flow of cool drinks to the riders.”Cummings also cited ice baths, but added that they do not attract universal approval. “When I was a rider, there was an ice bath following us around at the Vuelta a España one year, but nobody ever used the thing. Other teams use them every day. We have the ice socks and the vehicles will have fridges with more drinks. Right now, I don’t think any team would dare run out of drinks.”Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tadej PogacarTour de FranceCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

The latter was evident on Sunday as England demonstrated their superior speed of passing, movement and close control in a very one-sided affair.Having started the game in relatively untidy fashion with a few wayward passes for the first 10 minutes, England were handed a priceless opportunity to break the deadlock when the video assistant referee controversially awarded them a penalty.The referee, Frida Klarlund, had originally given England a free-kick on the edge of the box after Carrie Jones tangled with Georgia Stanway, but replays showed that the contact – however minimal it appeared to be – had taken place inside the area. Wales were baffled. England were grateful. Stanway dispatched the penalty low to her left, and from there on the Lionesses never looked back.After the match, Stanway told reporters: “It was just about being patient, making sure that we can tire them out, making them run, find the pockets, and it allowed us to get the early goal, which allowed us to set up [take control].”View image in fullscreenBeth Mead fires home England’s fifth goal from close range.Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Getty ImagesThere was suddenly more of a zip to England’s passing and the goals were soon flowing. After Wales failed to clear their lines, Alessia Russo pounced and slipped the ball into the path of Ella Toone, whose first effort was blocked on the line but she followed up on the rebound to double the defending champions’ lead.Suddenly Sarina Wiegman’s team were brimming with confidence. Keira Walsh fired narrowly wide and Russo missed a headed chance from a Lauren James cross.Consecutive England attacks came down their right flank and James was toying with her markers, at one stage simply trapping the ball dead before finding Toone’s overlapping run, and the Manchester United midfielder’s nicely weighted cross was nodded in at the far post by Lauren Hemp.More neat combinations between James and Toone led to Russo slotting in her first goal of the tournament as the Lionesses coasted towards a 4-0 half-time lead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So by the midway stage it become somewhat irrelevant whether they won narrowly or by a hatful.Try telling that to the players on both teams, though. And try telling that to both sets of fans, who had decorated the historic old town centre in St Gallen with their respective white and red flags, banter-themed songs and a good‑natured rivalry, bringing a real sense of atmosphere to this pretty, ancient city in north-eastern Switzerland.Sensing her team were through, Wiegman began to ring the changes and Beth Mead, on as a substitute, added the fifth, twisting inside the penalty area before slotting in with her left foot and rushing to celebrate with the rest of the bench.Fishlock slipped a good ball through to Cain, whose clinical finish temporarily reduced the deficit, but soon the Chelsea striker Aggie Beever-Jones headed in her own first major tournament goal as Wiegman’s team demonstrated their strength in depth as well as their unrelenting determination to continue scoring.Wiegman was delighted to see her players enjoying themselves, saying: “Six goals and they dictated the game. That is really good to see. The most important thing is that we’re through. We’re out of this very hard group and now we look forward to Sweden.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamWales women's football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

While they prepare to face Germany here on Saturday, the 2017 European champions head back to Amsterdam with their latest head coach bidding them farewell.Jonker will be replaced next month by the England assistant coach Arjan Veurink but at least he departed raging against the dying of the light in the course of an opening as dramatic as the thunder and lightning that prefaced torrential pre-match rain at St Jakob-Park.It represented bad news for those fans who had crayoned the French tricolour on to their cheeks or painted their faces bonfire bright Dutch orange. Rivulets of carefully applied colour were still dripping on to chins when, as suddenly as it begun, that apocalyptic storm ended and the sky brightened in time for kick-off.Netherlands supporters detected sunnier times ahead when the France goalkeeper Pauline Peyraud-Magnin was quickly forced to dive low to deny the Arsenal midfielder Victoria Pelova from distance.Attacking urgency represented their team’s sole hope of progression from Group D but, much as it sent excitement levels soaring inside the stadium, this exhilaratingly gung-ho approach invited counterattacks. Daphne van Domselaar saved with her legs from the ever dangerous Cascarino, before tipping Sakina Karchaoui’s follow-up shot round a post as the rain started falling again.Given that Bonadei’s side required a draw, at most, to progress there was a sense France were playing within themselves as, with initially mixed results, they attempted to draw Dutch sting by slowing things down at every opportunity and taking their time over dead balls.Such patience proved a virtue, temporarily at least, when the unmarked Sandie Toletti half-volleyed France ahead after meeting Katoto’s fine left-wing cross following a damaging concession of possession by the Oranje.View image in fullscreenSandie Toletti (left) celebrates after scoring the first goal of the game for France.Photograph: Image Photo Agency/Getty ImagesNot that Dutch redemption was too far away. Although Peyraud-Magnin performed wonders to keep Chasity Grant’s volley out, Pelova delighted in lashing the rebound into the top corner.The psychological damage inflicted as England beat Jonker’s team 4-0 in Zurich was evaporating by the minute. By way of proving it, the Netherlands took the lead through Selma Bacha’s own goal after Peyraud-Magnin’s failure to deal with a cross.Although Bacha seemed well positioned to clear off the line she was wrong-footed by Lineth Beerensteyn’s fleeting touch, leaving the ball to rebound off her and ricochet into the net as a newly tense Bonadei folded his arms a little tighter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When a momentary loss of Dutch focus handed possession to Cascarino her game-changing lofted through ball left Katoto’s left foot to do the rest.Not to be upstaged, Cascarino swiftly registered an even more eye-catching goal from the edge of the area after dodging a couple of Dutch defenders before cutting inside and unleashing a dipping and unerring right-foot shot.Cascarino, suitably inspired, then scored again, polishing off the rebound after Katoto’s shot hit both posts.As serial underachievers at a series of major tournaments, France are horribly prone to hitting the metaphorical woodwork. Yet as Karchaoui scored their fifth goal, an immaculate left-foot penalty awarded after Kerstin Casparij’s foul on Melween N’Dongala, the sense grew that this time it might just be different.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Netherlands women's football teamFrance women's football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

While Fifpro welcomed the commitment to a 72-hour gap between games during the season, as well as a three-week break during the summer, it is understood union executives have been left nonplussed by what has been described as a flawed process.The Guardian has learned that no one from Fifpro or the Professional Footballers’ Association (PFA) was present at the meeting with Fifa officials in New York on Saturday that led to what was an unexpected announcement. In a photograph that accompanied Fifa’s press release its president, Gianni Infantino, was pictured with union officials from all over the world, but many of them were from organisations expelled from Fifpro, while others were former Fifpro leaders who have left office after elections. Fifpro and Fifa declined to comment when contacted by The Guardian.Warning shot for 2026: Club World Cup’s brutal heat exposes a World Cup riskRead moreFifa’s launch of the expanded 32-teamClub World Cuphas led to fresh concerns being raised about player welfare, with Fifpro and the PFA filing a lawsuit with the EU last year accusing Fifa of abusing its dominant position by expanding the fixture calendar without consultation.On the eve of the tournament in the US, Fifpro issued a list of demands for 12 new safeguards for player wellbeing, including a mandatory four-week post-season break, mid-season breaks and workload limits for academy players under the age of 18. Amid the high temperatures which have been a feature of the Club World Cup, Fifpro’s medical director, Dr Vincent Gouttebarge, called for half-time breaksto be extended to 20 minutes.A Fifa statement said: “The meeting addressed key issues concerning player health [men and women], a top priority given that it forms part of the occupational risk prevention framework established by the International Labour Organization (ILO). Fifa and the player unions reviewed upcoming joint projects involving the world’s football governing body and players’ representative organisations, with a specific focus on player rest and recovery, as well as competitions within the context of the international match calendar [IMC].“There is a consensus that there must be at least 72 hours of rest between matches, and that players should have a rest period/holiday of at least 21 days at the end of each season. This period should be managed individually by each club and the respective players depending on their match calendars, and taking into account applicable collective agreements.“Furthermore, a rest day per week should also be planned, whilst being managed pragmatically. In addition, it was discussed that player travel – especially long-haul intercontinental trips – and the climatic conditions under which matches are played, should be considered when defining policies for the upcoming IMC.”View image in fullscreenFluminense’s Thiago Silva has a drink as he and his teammates struggle with the heat at the Club World Cup.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersWhile Fifa’s statement conceded the need to strike a balance between club and international competitions, it also made clear that they will not back down from the principle of creating more global events. “Regarding competitions, Fifa and the player unions agreed on the importance of striking the right balance between national team football and club football on the one hand, and between domestic, continental and global club competitions on the other hand.“It is important to create opportunities for players from all over the world to compete in top competitions as this boosts global football development. Additionally, offering more playing opportunities to players who are not at the highest international level was also identified as a priority.”Explore more on these topicsFifaClub World Cup 2025Club World CupFootball politicsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Mohamed Salah was visibly moved by the ovation for his club’s “Forever 20”. It was the aftermath of a poignant and important afternoon for Liverpool that left the deepest impression, however.For seven minutes after the pre‑season friendly, staged 10 days after the brothers were killed in a car accident in north‑western Spain,Liverpoolfans in the Bill Shankly Stand sang Jota’s name on repeat. And for those seven minutes Liverpool’s players, coaches and backroom staff stood facing their fans and clapped in unison with the tribute. The connection and the release, if only brief and only temporary, vindicated Liverpool’s decision to get back to work and play.Liverpool retire No 20 shirt in honour of Diogo Jota after forward’s deathRead moreDeepdale delivered thoughtful tributes throughout Liverpool’s 3-1 win. Preston’s captain, Ben Whiteman, walked out alone before kick-off carrying a wreath he laid in front of the away fans, while You’ll Never Walk Alone wassung beautifullyand an image of Jota and Silva from their Porto days filled the giant screen.Understandably, Liverpool did not conduct any pre- or post-match interviews but Arne Slot spoke movingly to the club’s in-house media before the game. The head coach spoke of finding comfort in the fact that Jota “in the last month of his life, he was achampion in everything” – with Liverpool, Portugal and his young family, having married Rute Cardoso 11 days before his death. Slot added that the support Liverpool have received not only from their own fans but from Everton, from around the country and across the world meant that “to represent this club in this city now even means more to me and to my wife than it did before”.View image in fullscreenA Liverpool fan holds a photo in memory of Diogo Jota before the match against Preston.Photograph: Ed Sykes/Action Images/ReutersSlot’s take on the friendly itself was powerful. His message could also apply to what lies ahead for Liverpool in what is certain to be the most trying of seasons. Should Jota’s grieving teammates retain their Premier League title it will rank as a truly extraordinary achievement, along with a fitting and emotional tribute. And if they don’t, well, it will not really matter.“Nothing seems to be important if we think of what has happened,” said Slot. “But we are a football club and we need to train and we need to play again, if we want it or not. What I’ve said to the players, I can say it here as well. It’s very difficult to find the right words because we constantly debate what is appropriate. What is appropriate in our actions? What is appropriate [for] what we have to say? Can we train again? Can we laugh again? Can we be angry if there’s a wrong decision?“I’ve said to them, maybe the best thing for us to do is handle this situation like Jota was. And what I meant with that is that Jota was always himself, it didn’t matter if he was talking to me, to his teammates, to the staff, he was always himself. So let us try to be ourselves as well. So, if we want to laugh we laugh; if we want to cry we’re going to cry. If they want to train they can train, if they don’t want to train they can not train. But be yourself, don’t think you have to be different than your emotions tell you.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So too did Darwin Núñez’s response to scoring Liverpool’s second goal. Having capitalised on a weak back-pass to round Preston’s goalkeeper, Daniel Iversen, the Uruguay international re-enacted two of Jota’s goal celebrations – the “Baby Shark” he performed for his children after scoring against Everton and the “gamer” celebration that has now become a tribute to him from footballers all over the world. Cody Gakpo also did the shark celebration after completing Liverpool’s win.The goal meant much more to Núñez than it would in normal circumstances and he pointed to the heavens after his Jota‑inspired celebrations.

If Arsenal had met ­Sporting’s initial €70m asking price under stan­dard terms, the Portuguese club would have netted roughly €63m after fees. Under the new arrangement, they will receive slightly more without losing a cut to intermediaries.Tensions between Gyökeres and Sporting have grown in recent weeks as he has made no secret of his desire to join ­Arsenal. But their president, Frederico ­Varandas, had insisted they would not budge over their valuation of a player who scored 54 times in 52 games last season. He confirmed that Sporting intend to fine Gyökeres unless he can present a legitimate justification for his absence, such as medical reasons, extended leave authorised by the board, or an urgent family matter.“We are calm,” Varandas said on Saturday evening. “Everything can be resolved with the close of the transfer window, a heavy fine and an apology to the group.” With ­reference to Arsenal he said: “If they don’t want to pay Viktor’s fair market value we are very comfortable with that for the next three years.”Arsenal are also expected to make a new approach for Christian Mosquera this week after their initial bid of £14m was rejected by Valencia. The Spain Under-21 defender has already agreed personal terms for a move to the Emirates Stadium.Leandro Trossard could be sold to help balance the books, with Bayern Munich the latest club to show an interest in him. The Belgium forward has also been linked with Fenerbahce and clubs in Saudi Arabia and is likely to cost around £20m.Noni Madueke is close to finalisinghis £52m move from Chelseato Arsenal and is poised for his medical this week. The 23-year-old will sign a five-year contract.Arsenal have also made progress in negotiations over a new contract for Ethan Nwaneri, who has attracted interest from Chelsea and clubs in Germany but is expected tojoin his fellow academy graduate Myles Lewis-Skellyin agreeing a deal to stay.Explore more on these topicsArsenalSportingTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

He has played 930 games over the course of a career and has won seven league titles and six Champions Leagues. He even broke the Messi-Ronaldo duopoly to claim the Ballon d’Or after inspiring Croatia to the World Cup final in 2018.He rarely lasts a full 90 minutes these days, didn’t start a game during the Club World Cup and suffered the indignity of coming on for his Madrid farewell with the semi-final against Paris Saint-Germainlong since lost. He could have retired five years ago and still been one of the most respected players in the history of the game but, his eyes on next summer’s World Cup, when his contract at Real Madrid expired Modricchose to join Milan.It’s not just a significant move for Modric. It also confirms Serie A as the undisputed home of the (gifted) senior citizen. Next season,Kevin De Bruyne, at 34, will be lining up for Napoliafter his move from Manchester City, while the 37-year-old Francesco Acerbi and the 36-year-old Henrikh Mkhitaryan are still at Inter and the 34-year-old Marten de Roon continues to anchor Atalanta’s midfield with Juan Cuadrado, at 37, on the flank. The average Serie A player is 14 months older than the average of Europe’s top 31 leagues.Real Madrid’s PSG thrashing shows Xabi Alonso true size of rebuilding jobRead moreFootball, increasingly, is a young man’s game. There is a wealth of evidence that the intensity of the modern pressing means players reach their peaks earlier. Over the past decade the number of players aged 23 and under who have played more than 900 Premier League minutes has increased by 32%. At the same time, every Ballon d’Or winner since Kaká in 2007 is still playing.That is probably the result of two factors. Physical conditioning has never been so good. Footballers live healthier lives. Their diets are more closely monitored and understanding of nutrition and recovery is better than ever before. There have never been fewer bad tackles; and even if that benefit is offset by the gruelling nature of today’s pressing game, modern sports medicine means broken legs and cruciate ruptures are no longer the career-ending injuries they once would have been.At the same time, there is now a penumbra of leagues outside the elite that demand star players and can afford to pay them, while offering an environment when the football is of a reasonable level but less demanding than in, say, the Premier League. Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo benefit from the salaries and exposure of the United States and Saudi Arabia, while Major League Soccer and the Saudi Pro League benefit from their celebrity. They are far from the first two leagues that have offered a mutually beneficial late-career payday, but they are perhaps better established, more visible and more attractive than ever before.View image in fullscreenLuka Modric played his last game for Real Madrid at the Club World Cup.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Fifa/Getty ImagesWhich brings us toSerie Athat, while still ranking far higher than MLS or the Saudi Pro League, has clearly fallen a long way from its 1980s and 90s heyday. It is a competition replete with stars, but they are stars a few years beyond their peak.While every league would probably like to be financially dominant, there is no great harm in that – or at least there shouldn’t be. As football’s economics become increasingly stratified, every league has had to find its niche.Sweden – almost despite itself, given the clubs would almost certainly vote for video assistant referees were they not mandated by their members not to – has become celebrated for its “authenticity”, with a lively ultra culture and a retro vibe. Germany is the home of thrusting young coaches with iPads and new pressing models. Spain has theclásicoand France has PSG. Italy has to face the reality that it is no longer hegemonic.There are no Italian clubs among the top 10 wealthiest. Although Juventus and Inter have lost in two Champions League finals since, no Serie A side has won it since the latter in 2010.Serie A has become a league where the pace is a little slower, where veterans can be effective – and there is a charm in that. Just as there is something comforting – from the point of view of the casual audience if not the administrators – in the way so many of the best players in snooker are the same as they were a decade or two ago, so Serie A is increasingly becoming a showcase for the familiar, from Romelu Lukaku to Scott McTominay, from Stefan de Vrij to Ruben Loftus-Cheek.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s easy to understand why De Bruyne, once Manchester City had decided they did not wish to offer him a new deal, preferred to join Napoli than to scrap on in the hurly-burly of the Premier League for an aspirant mid-table side. Or why Modric has gone there rather than flogging himself around the US. Not everything has to be done at a ferocious tempo. Not everything even has to be the best.Since Juventus’s years of domination came to an end, there have been three champions in five seasons and six sides finishing in the top three, including Napoli and Lazio, both of whom had won the league only twice before that spell, and Atalanta, who have never won Serie A. That suggests a healthy level of competition and a pleasing mix of grand old names and teams elevated by sensible investment and/or inspirational management. In a world that wasn’t obsessed by growth, week-to-week intrigue would be more than enough.But modern football is a world obsessed by growth, thanks to the widespread involvement of private equity firms, many of them American. Eight Serie A teams are majority-owned by US companies. A popular league blessed with veteran stars is not enough, which is why Milan’s home game against Como next seasoncould be played in Perth, Australia.Perhaps it’s the constant drive for more than inspired progress, but it often feels the beauty of what already exists can be missed; and the prospect of Modric playing for Milan, producing another season of those passes with the outside of his right foot, is worth celebrating.Explore more on these topicsSerie ALuka ModricMilanEuropean club footballFinancescommentShareReuse this content"

We knew today would be a different game because we knew we would have the ball a lot.England surge into last eight after Stanway sparks emphatic win against WalesRead more“I’m very happy with the performance. We knew that Wales really wanted to fight and we tried to stay out of it. I think in most of the moments we did but in the beginning we were sloppy. I hope we keep going with this. We created great chances like we did against the Netherlands and now we have to break down Sweden.”A key part of England’s improved form during a tough Group D was a shift in gameplan from Wiegman and the coaching staff. One change has been the introduction of Ella Toone back into the No 10 role against the Netherlands with the ever-creative Lauren James moving out to the right.Keira Walsh, the Uefa player of the match, credited Toone for England’s change in fortunes. “She’s come in and done an incredible job,” she said. “People speak about her offensively, but the defensive work she does for me and Georgia [Stanway] when she’s in [the No 10 role] is incredible. She covers a lot of spaces that we can’t.“That’s probably been the main thing that’s stopped other teams from playing. Obviously with Lauren James on the wing, we’ve managed to get both of them on the pitch at the same time and they are two world-class players.”In her two tournament appearances, Toone has looked back to her best. A goal and two assists in 45 minutes against Wales made her a standout performer and her 100% pass completion rate caught the eye.“I feel like I’m in a really good place,” the 25-year-old said. “I’ve missed this Ella Toone. I’ve not had it for a while. I feel like I’m really coming into it and I’m really enjoying it. I love playing with these girls. I love the football that we play.“I feel like I’m in a good mindset and enjoying my football and that’s when I’m probably playing my best so it was nice to get two assists and another goal tonight. Hopefully I can keep continuing in that form.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think the intensity in the last two games – we’ve really attacked. In defence, we’ve tried to win the ball back really fast so I think we’re happy with where we’re at.“Sarina [Wiegman] wanted us to be confident and to enjoy it. We obviously play better football when we do that. There was more flow to the game tonight and better connections so we just have to keep that going and keep the momentum up in the next game.”England will face Sweden next in the quarter-finals, an opposition that they are well-acquainted with. “They’re always very powerful,” Wiegman said. “They have speed up front on the counterattack. They are a hard team to beat and have done well in the group. We will see and we will get ready.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Sarina WiegmanEngland women's football teamWales women's football teamWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

The world No 1 beat the two-time defending champion 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to become the first Italian to win a Wimbledon singles title and clinch his fourth grand slam crown.“It’s amazing to be in this position,” Sinner said. “We were talking before the match, we would never have thought to be in this position back in the days when I was young. This was only a dream; dream of the dream as it was so far away from where I am from.Jannik Sinner roars back to beat Carlos Alcaraz for first Wimbledon final winRead more“I am living my dream. It’s amazing. I want to thank my team and everyone who came here from this special day. You give me so much emotions on and off the court and we try to keep pushing and become a better tennis player, but mostly a better person.”A month before Sinner’sWimbledontriumph, the Italian had endured a devastating defeat against Alcaraz in the French Open final, losing in five sets after holding a triple match point in the fourth set.Asked what the biggest challenge on the path to winning his first trophy, Sinner said: “I would say mostly emotionally because I had a very tough loss in Paris. But at the end of the day it really doesn’t matter how you win or you lose. Especially in important tournaments. You just have to understand what you did wrong, try to work on that.“That is exactly what we did. To accept the loss and to keep working, this is for sure one of the reasons why I hold the trophy here. I am just so grateful that I am healthy, I have great people around me, which is the most important part, and having this trophy with them means a lot.”Sinner’s victory marks a turning point in his rivalry with Alcaraz, which looks likely to define the next few years of men’s tennis. His triumph ended Alcaraz’s five consecutive wins against him and the Spaniard’s 24-match winning run.Between them, the pair have now won the past seven grand slam singles championships. Despite the difficult defeat, Alcaraz chose to remain positive after a stretch that has included some of the best tennis of his career.“I’m really, really happy and proud of everything that I am doing,” he said. “At the beginning of the season, I struggled a little bit on and off the court. Then suddenly I started to bring joy on the court again, be happy.“That excitement that I have every time I step on the court is a thank you to my team. To my family. A lot of friends. I am lucky that I have them here. Without them it wouldn’t be possible to stand here now, to play great tennis, have a lot of joy on court.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Carlos AlcarazJannik SinnerWimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Yeah, just happened to have chipped it in. I don’t know if I can do it again. That was great.”But earlier in the day, Kim had felt she had missed the boat after she had double-bogeyed the 12th hole.“I thought I was out of it,” she said. “But I just said to myself and to my caddy, ‘I’ve got nothing else to lose’.”It was the cue for her to play almost as if in a trance over the clutch late holes and in the playoff.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I was kind of losing motivation. I kind of had to get some hard conversations done with the team. Yeah, kind of had to wake up a little bit.“So to be sitting here next to this trophy is definitely surreal.”Completing a stellar championship for Australia’s exciting batch of stars, 2024 runner-up Steph Kyriacou had another last-day charge to storm home with a 64 to tie for 14th.Explore more on these topicsGolfAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

It has been a slow process but there are growing signs that their youth-driven recruitment is working. In Maresca’s first season in charge Chelsea have qualified for the Champions League, won the Conference League and dominated PSG in a major final.“It’s a great feeling,” Palmer said. “Even better because everyone doubted us before the game, we knew that. To put a fight on like we did, it’s good. The gaffer put a great gameplan out. He knew where the space was going to be. He tried to free me up as much as possible and I just had to repay him and score some goals.”Palmer features alongside Kylian Mbappé and Vinícius Júnior on billboards in New York. “I’ve seen the billboards in Time’s Square and outside Madison Square Garden,” he said. “It’s a nice feeling to be alongside those type of players.”Maresca was delighted with Palmer. “These are the games where we expect Cole to appear,” he said. “Big games and big moments and once again he showed how good he is.”Chelsea, who have made around £90m from their time in the US, will have three weeks off before returning to training in the lead-up to the new season. They open their Premier League campaign by hosting Crystal Palace on 17 August. “Of course I am very excited [about the future],” Maresca said. “But I’m more excited that we have three weeks off.”View image in fullscreenReece James lifts the trophy alongside his Chelsea teammates.Photograph: Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty ImagesMaresca hailed his young side for carrying out the plan to perfection. “I have no words for the players,” the Italian said. “They all deserve this and it’s a good moment. We won the game in the first 10 minutes. We set the tempo and we were very good at pressing them. The conditions made it hard to keep going but the boys did well.”There was praise for Palmer, who shone in a right-sided role, but Maresca focused on the whole team. “ Today we found a position for him where there was more space to attack,” he said. “Obviously Cole played really well but the effort from all the players was fantastic.”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump looks over the golden glove with the Fifa president Gianni Infantino after the Club World Cup final.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersMaresca did not downplay Chelsea’s achievement in becoming world champions. “I think it will become as important as the Champions League and we value it as much as winning the Champions League,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump, who appeared next to Boehly and Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino, ignored the boos and remained front and centre with Chelsea’s players as they lifted the trophy.“I knew he was going to be here but I didn’t know he was going to be on the stand when we lifted the trophy,” Palmer said. “I was a bit confused.”There was a major security operation outside the ground before the match. Secret Service officials were present in the surrounding areas because of Trump attending the game and bag checks were conducted by Transport Security Administration officials.PSG were stunned by Chelsea and lost their cool towards the end. João Neves was sent off for pulling Marc Cucurella’s hair and Luis Enrique, the Ligue 1 side’s manager, may face disciplinary action after appearing to push João Pedro in the face.Luis Enrique defended himself by saying he was trying to separate players after a brawl broke out at full time. “I have no problem expressing my feeling at the end of the game in a high level of pressure,” he said. “It’s very stressful for all of us. It is going to be impossible to avoid. Everybody was involved. It was not what was best and the end result of the pressure of the match.“I have seen Maresca. I saw he had pushed others and we had to separate all the players and I do not know where that pressure came from. But this is a situation we must all avoid.

Infantino moved out of frame of television cameras while Trump stayed put, finding himself squarely in focus as Chelsea captain Reece James lifted the trophy and his team-mates celebrated around him.The final of the newly expanded tournament, ostensibly aimed at crowning a world champion of club soccer, kicked off at 3pm local time amid the searing heat that has been one of the storylines of the controversial competition so far. To the extent there was a US-specific connection in the matchup, it lay with Chelsea, owned by a group headed by American billionaire Todd Boehly, who joined Trump, Infantino and PSG chair Nasser el-Khelaifi on stage after the match.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump stayed front and center as Chelsea lifted the trophy.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/APSecurity at the stadium was significantly elevated from previous matches held at the venue, with Secret Service agents posted at stadium gates. Lines to get in moved slowly but without major incident as temperatures rose to 85F (29C) for the a kickoff that was delayed by about eight minutes.The president’s motorcade pulled into a special entrance located adjacent to the players’, with Trump and his entourage exiting his car under a tent with curtains drawn about 30 minutes before the match. The US national anthem, which had been played one hour before kickoff at every previous Club World Cup game as a regular part of the pregame schedule, was moved up to take place just before the start of the game with Trump due to be present. When Trump was shown on stadium video boards standing for the anthem, the crowd reacted with booing for several seconds.Accompanying Trump in the midfield luxury box were Infantino, former New England Patriots quarterback and current Fox Sports commentator Tom Brady, and media mogul Rupert Murdoch. Members of Trump’s cabinet, including attorney general Pam Bondi, transportation secretary Sean Duffy and Homeland Security chief Kristi Noem were also present, as was the Club World Cup trophy, which has sat in the Oval Office since Infantino presented it to Trump in an event earlier this year.Infantino has sought to form a closer association with Trump on several occasions since Fifa awarded the Club World Cup hosting rights to the United States in 2023. He described his relationship with Trump as “absolutely crucial” in a February meeting with the International Football Association Board, and has appeared alongside Trump at several public events, including at the Oval Office when announcing the creation of a World Cup task force.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He sat at the Top of the Rock on Saturday, peering over Manhattan as part of a promotional shot with Paris Saint-Germain’s Ousmane Dembélé, and he was on top of the world on Sunday. He mooched around the pitch at a gobsmacked MetLife Stadium, playing as if he was having a kickabout with his mates, andhe destroyed PSG. We’re playing the European champions, are we? And theybeat Real Madrid 4-0the other day? Fine. I’ll just score two identical goals midway through the first half. Then I’ll come up with an outrageous assist to put us 3-0 up just before half-time. Will that do?This was a jaw-dropping performance from Chelsea’s No 10. This was Palmer launching himself into global superstardom with an almost casual destruction of PSG. He has starred in finals before but this was on another level. Palmer bent the first final of Fifa’s expandedClub World Cupto his will, shattering any concern over whether the Premier League’s fourth best being crowned world champions diminishes the tournament, and has ended any debate over whether he is up there with the best in the world.Chelsea stun PSG to win Club World Cup after Cole Palmer’s cool doubleRead morePSG were stunned. They are the team of the moment, up there with the most accomplished since Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona, butChelseabelieved this was their time. “Who said that?” Enzo Maresca had asked when it was suggested his players would have to survive long spells without the ball? In the event, though, Chelsea’s head coach was bluffing a little. His young side stuck to their promise to play, not to park the bus, but they were not gung ho and knew exactly how to target PSG’s weak points.Minute one: Robert Sánchez goes long. Chelsea were ready to be direct and bypass the ferocious PSG press. They have been more vertical in recent months, Maresca’s approach more flexible, and their tactics rattled PSG, who were smothered and unable to deal with being turned around time and again.This was a triumph for Maresca, who will go into next season confident that Chelsea are ready for their Champions League return. He added ballast in midfield by putting Reece James in with Enzo Fernández and Moisés Caicedo. João Pedro, scorer of three in three matches since joining just before the quarter-finals, was an effective foil as a No 9. Pedro Neto tracked Achraf Hakimi’s raids. But Chelsea also moved the ball quickly when they won it and their setup liberated Palmer, stationed in an inside-right role and busy discombobulating Nuno Mendes.View image in fullscreenPedro Neto celebrates Chelsea’s victory in which he scored their third goal.Photograph: Marvin Ibo Guengoer/GES Sportfoto/Getty ImagesAnd so to the 22nd minute. There was another precise long kick from Sánchez, who kept aiming for the right, where Mendes was struggling. Malo Gusto, offering boundless energy from right-back, got the better of the PSG left-back. Gusto had a shot blocked. Better, he thought, to find Palmer. The 23-year-old had already whipped one effort narrowly wide; this time he took a touch, used Marquinhos as a shield and feathered a low shot past Gianluigi Donnarumma with his left foot.PSG were on 60% possession at that stage. Not once were they comfortable, though. They were strangely unfocused, summed up by the moment when Désiré Doué passed up an easy chance to shoot at 0-0. Dembélé was the Barça Dembélé. Fabián Ruiz, Vitinha and João Neves were outplayed by Caicedo – how amazing to think his participation was in doubt because of an ankle injury.PSG’s discipline disappeared as full time approached, Neves sent off for pulling Marc Cucurella’s hair. Chelsea played as a collective. The scoffing about their youth-driven project feels dated now. Chelsea will not allow themselves to think it is job done, even after putting a gold badge on the shirt for the next four years and almost £100m in the bank during their month in the US, but they will take immense confidence from suffocating PSG.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sánchez made saves. Trevoh Chalobah roared after one perfect tackle on Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. There was more outrageousness from Palmer in the 29th minute, a little shimmy, a sway of the hips, time standing still. Gusto, with a decoy run, took PSG’s centre-backs out of the equation. The movement was synchronised but it still took individual quality to make it work. Palmer obliged, clinically rolling another shot past Donnarumma.It was all so insouciant, so smooth. Palmer is stronger than he looks, his wiry frame holding off defenders, his feet so quick. Hard work goes with the nutmegs, brilliant feints and subtle passes. Palmer earns the right to play. He drifted inside again on 42 minutes, weighed up the opposition and slipped João Pedro through to dink Donnarumma, the final over before it had started. Cole Palmer FC, the term used to imply Chelsea were a one‑man team, is not the insult it once was.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025ChelseaParis Saint-GermainUS sportsClub World CupanalysisShareReuse this content"

But its legacy is loud: a reckoning with risk, glory, and the radical idea that women can choose bothSun 13 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Jul 2025 05.01 EDTShareThere are two salient pictures of the Katie Taylor–Amanda Serrano trilogy: Taylor walking to the ring on Friday night under the green, orange and white bars of light, her neck like a tree trunk, eyes fixed ahead with stoic grandeur asEven Though I Walkplayed overhead – and the image, hours earlier, of Yulihan Luna bloodied and bruised, standing beside a ring girl whose hoisted breasts had been shellacked in oil, smiling rigidly at a camera that wasn’t looking at the fighter.That’s boxing. That’s also being a woman.At Madison Square Garden – half cathedral, half Thunderdome –Katie Taylorapproached the ring like a martyr. Her arms stayed low and still, her expression stony, the moment at once subdued and transcendent. I am not religious. I was personally rooting for Serrano. But when I heard that worship music and saw Taylor ascend and bow between the ropes, I seemed to see stars as tears blurred the lights of the Garden’s lofted ceiling into a constellation: The Fighter.A spectacle like this ought to be mawkish. But it isn’t. Because when the song ends, two women risk their legacies, their health, their lives – however unlikely – to feel something like greatness. And unlike most sports, in boxing, the risk is not metaphorical. The danger is useless. It protects no country. No one is conscripted. But it underwrites everything that feels noble about this violent, anachronistic art. And when women, historically deemed too fragile to fight, headline an iconic arena that has never before granted them that right, the danger takes on a new meaning.View image in fullscreenKatie Taylor walks to the ring to fight Amanda Serrano on Friday night in New York.Photograph: Al Bello/Getty Images for NetflixThey say styles make fights. They also make stories. Taylor, the pride of Ireland, is all monkish discipline and point-winning speed. Serrano, the southpaw from Puerto Rico by way of Brooklyn, combines firepower with grit. One boxed her way through 15 years of amateur pedigree, the other turned pro at 19 and never looked back. Both are in their mid-30s, both single, both quiet. Sainted recluses with 17 world titles between them and a lifetime of sacrifice.If Taylor is the tactician, Serrano is the flamethrower. This polarization is what produced lightning in the first two fights. But by Friday night, their plans of attack had changed. Serrano, seeking alternatives after two contentious decisions that didn’t go her way, tried to outbox the boxer. Taylor, burned before in brawls, circled and struck, then slipped away. From round one, it was clear: this was no longer a firestorm. The fight bore more resemblance to Mayweather-Pacquiao than Ali-Frazier I. Smart. Tactical. Controlled. For some, disappointing.But why do we need chaos to believe in a woman’s greatness?In other sports, I root for my team to win, ugly or not. But in women’s boxing, I confess to a double standard: I want glory and a good show. I want drama, blood, something irrefutable. That fear – that if women don’t entertain, the sport will vanish – lingers like smoke above the ring. But Taylor and Serrano were not performing for our approval. They were fighting to win.This, in itself, is progress.View image in fullscreenKatie Taylor and Amanda Serrano react after Friday’s fight.Photograph: Noam Galai/Getty Images for NetflixTrue equality in boxing is not the right to inspire. It’s the right to be boring. To clinch and move. To fight safe. To win ugly. Taylor-Serrano III wasn’t transcendent because it was thrilling. It was transcendent because it didn’t have to be.And yet boxing remains a sport of contradictions. To protect yourself, you must risk everything. To gain glory, you court death. And still – some would deny women the choice to do so.When Amanda Serrano and more than a dozen elite fighters issued a joint call last year for 12 three-minute rounds – the same as men – they framed it not as a demand, but as a right: “We have earned the CHOICE,” they said.The irony is that boxing is one of the only spaces in Western society where a woman can risk her life and be compensated. But even then, OnlyFans logos hover over ring posts and girls in bikinis parade cards while bloodied fighters wait for judgment. Fans call the athletes they flew across oceans to support “autistic lesbians”. Serrano gets seven figures. Some women on the undercard get $1,500 and no health insurance – turning, more ironic still, to OnlyFans for financial security.View image in fullscreenKatie Taylor and Amanda Serrano embrace after Friday night’s fight.Photograph: Ed Mulholland/Getty ImagesWhat do we mean when we talk about choice?We fight for a woman’s right to have a child – or not. But what about the right to bleed for nothing more than self-belief? What about the right to hurt for glory, not survival? Women are told their bodies are sacred, but only in service of others – children, husbands, God. In boxing, they reclaim them. Not for nurture, but for risk. Not for life, but for something more defiant. Not Madonna. Not whore. Something else.Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano did not ask for sainthood. They asked for a trilogy. They made history, then made it again, then closed the book.Now, whether Friday night becomes a watershed or a footnote is not up to them.But for those of us watching, feeling the hush before the bell, the flutter of green, orange, red and blue fabric, the rush when Taylor’s glove was raised and an Irish flag drifted gently down from the upper seats – whether Catholic or atheist, Irish or Puerto Rican, man, woman, or something in between – these two ensured one thing:Watching them time after time after finally time again will do something more than impress you.It will resolve contradictions – between styles, between images of a fight, between even life and death – into a single indelible reckoning.Explore more on these topicsBoxingKatie TaylorUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

And so what we’re expecting to see then is that any company that shows material that shouldn’t be available to under-18s, pornography, suicide and self-harm material – that should be either removed from their service or they’re going to need highly effective age checks to screen out under-18s.”She added: “It is a very big moment for the industry, a very serious moment.”View image in fullscreenMelanie Dawes (left) said age checks were ‘a very big moment for the industry’.Photograph: Jeff Overs/BBC/PAThe rules, which come in on 25 July, are the latest elements to be enacted from the Online Safety Act, which the Conservatives passed in 2023.That act was brought partly in response to criticism from campaigners such as Ian Russell, whose 14-year-old daughter, Molly,died in 2017from an act of self-harm after viewing several thousand pieces of online content relating to depression, self-harm and suicide.Tory ministersremoved sections of the billin 2022, however, amid an internal row over whether it went too far by banning certain types of content deemed to be “legal but harmful”.Russell, who has previously called the act “timid”, said on Sunday he was worried about how it was being enforced byOfcom. The regulator has told technology companies they can choose how to carry out verification checks, but will assess how well they are working.Russell said: “The Ofcom PR is often spun such that it sounds like everything will change for the better in a matter of weeks. But I think it’s quite clear that Ofcom, as a regulator, needs to do more than just be good at spinning their PR. They need to act within the bounds of the act in the strongest possible way, and they’re not doing that.“They’re sitting in the middle, pushed on one side by families who’ve lost people, like me, and pushed on the other side by the power of the big tech platforms.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Chi Onwurah, the Labour MP who chairs the science and technology committee, said the Online Safety Act “just isn’t up to scratch”.Dawes refused to call for powers to tackle misinformation, however, saying: “If parliament decides to widen those towards mis- and disinformation, or wider issues around addiction for the kids, for example, then, of course, Ofcom stands ready to implement that.”She did, however, take aim at the BBC followingthe row over its coverage of Glastonburyand whether it should have continued to broadcast footage of the band Bob Vylan after its lead singer led the crowd in anti-Israel chants.“The BBC need to get a grip quicker, get these reports and investigations [into the incident] concluded sooner,” she said. “Otherwise there is a real risk of a loss of confidence in the BBC.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Yet a 95-year-old Cheshire woman and her soft toy collection have become the unlikely stars of a trend to encourage kindness in the comments.Brenda Allen said she had been flabbergasted by the response to her recentTikTokvideos, in which she talks about her quirky Jellycat figures. Encouraged by a staff member at her care home, she began by showing viewers a hat-wearing avocado named Florence. Her haul also features a cuddly pot plant and a squashy, smiling pain au chocolat.Her breakthrough video showed a flair for comedy, ending with her observation that her mushroom teddy was “a very fun guy”.Her videos have now amassed more than 2m views on the site, as well as thousands of comments from people across the world asking if they can adopt her as their social media grandma and calling her a national treasure.0:4895-year old woman shows her Jellycat collection – videoShe has since been sent additions to her collection from Jellycat and John Lewis - and her videos have been reposted by Love Island contestants. The only negativity has come from her budgie, Toto, who isn’t too keen on her cuddly blue tit and robin.“[The avocado] was my only one for a long time, then, gradually, some people have given me more of them,” Brenda said. “But all of a sudden, after the media thing, I was inundated with people ringing me and wanting to send me toys and everything. It was quite incredible.“One of the girls asked me to do a video. I didn’t know what it was for, really. She just said would I do a little video for her about jelly cats? So I said yes, and it’s gone from there. It’s gone mad. I’ve had some lovely messages. Everyone thinks I have a nice voice, apparently.”One of her Majesticare care home’s staff members posted the first video. It referenced the recent “you better be nice in the comments” trend, which has gained momentum as users search for more wholesome content on their timelines.It began in the US, where creator @yearningyardisposted a video of her boyfriend talking about his pot plants. She tells viewers – in a comically threatening way – that they better “say something nice” about him. That prompted others to make videos about the often eccentric hobbies of their friends and families. One even features a collection oftractor manuals.Celebrities including Ant and Dec have also become involved. Their video features Dec showing off Ant’s artwork, menacingly orderingcommenters to be kind.Brenda’s daughter, Julie, said the family had been “blown away” by her newfound fame. “We don’t quite understand it, but it’s amazing and it’s lovely,” she said. “What has blown me away is how lovely everybody has been. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything where all the comments are positive.”Care home residents venturing to the local garden centre have already been asked whether they know Brenda, as word of her notoriety has spread. She is now planning to auction her Jellycat toys and donate the proceeds to a local children’s hospice.Understandably, however, Brenda is content with only a brief moment of internet fame. “I don’t want to keep it on too long,” she said. “I’m 95, you know.”Explore more on these topicsTikTokOlder peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

Yet, when I step outside into the streets of New York City to grab a coffee or meet a friend for lunch, it feels downright tranquil. The contrast between the online world and my daily reality has only gotten more jarring.Since my own work is focused on topics such as intergroup conflict, misinformation, technology and climate change, I’m aware of the many challenges facing humanity. Yet, it seems striking that people online seem to be just as furious about thefinale of The White Lotusor the latest scandal involving a YouTuber. Everything is either the best thing ever or the absolute worst, no matter how trivial. Is that really what most of us are feeling? No, as it turns out. Our latest research suggests that what we’re seeing online is a warped image created by a very small group of highly active users.In apaperI recently published with Claire Robertson and Kareena del Rosario, we found extensive evidence that social media is less like a neutral reflection of society and more like a funhouse mirror. It amplifies the loudest and most extreme voices while muting the moderate, the nuanced and the boringly reasonable. And much of that distortion, it turns out, can be traced back to a handful of hyperactive online voices. Just 10% of users produce roughly 97% of political tweets.Let’s take Elon Musk’s own platform, X, as an example. Despite being home to hundreds of millions of users, a tiny fraction of them generate the vast majority of political content. For instance, Musk posted1,494 timesin his first 15 days of implementing government cuts for the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge)earlier this year. He was, essentially, writing non-stop. And many of his posts spread misinformation to his 221 million followers.On 2 February he wrote, “Did you know that USAID, using YOUR tax dollars, funded bioweapon research, including Covid-19, that killed millions of people?” His behaviour fits the pattern of many misinformation super-spreaders. A mere 0.1% of users share 80% of fake news. Twelve accounts – known as the“disinformation dozen”– created most of the vaccine misinformation on Facebook during the pandemic. These few hyperactive users produced enough content to create the false perceptions that many people were vaccine hesitant.Many of us are led to believe that society is far more polarized, angry, and deluded than it really isSimilar patterns can be observed across the internet. Only a small percentage of users engage in truly toxic behaviour, but they’re responsible for a disproportionate share of hostile or misleading content on nearly every platform, from Facebook to Reddit. Most people aren’t posting, arguing, or fuelling the outrage machine. But because the super-users are so active and visible, they dominate our collective impression of the internet.That means the resulting problems don’t remain confined to this small cohort, which distorts how the rest of us make sense of the world. Humans create mental models about what other people think or do. It’s how we figure out social norms and navigate groups. But on social media, this shortcut backfires. We don’t get a representative sample of opinions. Instead, we see a flood of extreme, emotionally charged content.In this way, many of us are led to believe that society is far more polarized, angry, and deluded than it really is. We think everyone on the other side of the generation gap, political spectrum, or fandom community is radical, malicious, or just plain dumb. Our information diet is shaped by a sliver of humanity whose job, identity, or obsession is to post constantly.This distortion fuels pluralistic ignorance – when we misperceive what others believe or do – and can shift our own behaviour accordingly. Think of voters who see only the angriest hot takes about immigration or climate change and assume there’s no common ground to be found.The problem isn’t just the individual extremists, of course – it’s the platform design and algorithms that amplify their content. These algorithms are built to maximise engagement, which means they privilege content that is surprising or divisive. The system is optimised to promote the very users who are most likely to distort our shared perception of reality.It gets worse. Imagine you’re sitting in a busy restaurant, having to speak a little louder just to be heard. Before long, everyone is shouting. These same dynamics happen online. People exaggerate their beliefs or repeat outrageous narratives to get attention and approval. In other words, even people who aren’t especially extreme may start acting that way online, because it gets rewarded.Most of us aren’t spending time on our phones trolling our foes. We’re busy working, raising families, spending time with friends, or simply trying to find some harmless entertainment on the internet. Yet, our voices are drowned out. We have effectively handed over a megaphone to the most obnoxious people and let them tell us what to believe and how to act.With over5 billion people now on social media, this technology isn’t going away. But the toxic dynamic I’ve described doesn’t have to hold sway. The first step is to see through the illusion and understand that a silent majority often lurks behind each incendiary thread. And we, as users, can take back some control – by curating our feeds, resisting the outrage bait, and refusing to amplify the nonsense. Think of it like deciding to follow a healthier, less processed diet.In arecent series of experiments, we paid people a few dollars to unfollow the most divisive political accounts on X. After a month, they reported feeling 23% less animosity towards other political groups. In fact, their experience was so positive that nearly half the people declined to refollow those hostile accounts after the study was over. And those who maintain their healthier newsfeed reported less animosity a full 11 months after the study.Platforms could easily redesign their algorithms to stop promoting the most outrageous voices and prioritise more representative or nuanced content. Indeed, this iswhat most people want. The internet is a powerful, and often valuable tool. But if we keep letting it reflect only the funhouse mirror world created by the most extreme users, we’ll all suffer the consequences.Jay Van Bavelis a professor of psychology at New York University.Further readingThe Righteous Mindby Jonathan Haidt (Penguin, £12.99)Going Mainstreamby Julia Ebner (Ithaka, £10.99)The Chaos Machineby Max Fisher (Quercus, £12.99)Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaThe big ideaPsychologyInternetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But the email, which includes a button to click on to “cancel” the subscription, is a scam and sent by fraudsters trying to steal your account login and payment details.After a recent surge in customers reporting fake messages, Amazon emailed its more than 200million Prime members globally to warn them.

They may also include a “cancel subscription” button that clicks through to a fake Amazon login page.This is not the only tactic being used to prey on Amazon shoppers.

Rapid advances in artificial intelligence have given rise to fears that the technology will make swathes of the workforce redundant.Graduates are seen as particularly vulnerable because entry-level jobs such as form-filling and basic data entry are strongly associated with the “drudge work” that AI systems – which perform tasks that typically have required human intelligence – could do instead.Over the past two and a half years the availability of such positions has dropped by a third, and last month it was reported that graduates are facing thetoughest UK job market since 2018.The Guardian spoke to some of the UK’s biggest recruitment agencies and employment experts for their views on the impact of AI on current and future opportunities for those entering the jobs market. Here are six key takeaways from what they said:1.The current crisis is as much economic as AI-ledA shifting graduate labour market is not unusual, said Kirsten Barnes, head of digital platform at Bright Network, which connects graduates and young professionals to employers.“Any shifts in the graduate job market this year – which typically fluctuates by 10-15% – appear to be driven by a combination of factors, including wider economic conditions and the usual fluctuations in business demand, rather than a direct impact from AI alone. We’re not seeing a consistent trend across specific sectors,” she said.Claire Tyler, head of insights at the Institute for Student Employers (ISE), which represents major graduate employers, said that among companies recruiting fewer graduates “none of them have said it’s down to AI”.Some recruitment specialists cited the recentincrease in employer national insurance contributionsas a factor in slowing down entry-level recruitment.Ed Steer, chief executive off Sphere Digital Recruitment, which hires for junior marketer and sales roles in tech and media, said graduate vacancies have fallen from 400 a year in 2021 to an expected 75 this year. He put the drop down to businesses wanting to hire more experienced applicants who can “deliver for their customers on day one”.2.But AI is definitely a factorHowever, Auria Heanley, co-founder of Oriel Partners, which recruits for personal assistant roles, has seen a 30% drop in entry-level roles this year. She said she had “no doubt” that “AI combined with wider economic uncertainty, is making it much tougher for graduates to find these roles”.Felix Mitchell, co-chief executive at Instant Impact, which recruits for mid-sized businesses, said jobs related to Stem [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] were the most disrupted. “I do think that the evidence suggests that AI will likely be a net job creator, but the losses are happening faster than the gains.”3.The revolution is only going to accelerateMajor tech companies such as Microsoft are trumpeting the impact of AI agents – systems that perform human-level cognitive tasks autonomously – as tools that can be competent assistants in the workplace, with early adopters including the consultancy McKinsey and the law firm Clifford Chance. Dario Amodei, the boss of AI the developer Anthropic, has warned that the technology could wipe out half of all entry-level office jobs in the next five years.James Reed, chief executive of the employment agency Reed, said AI would transform the whole jobs market from now on: “This is the year of AI… lots of businesses are really doubling down on it, investing in it.“This feels like the year that AI is really changing and getting embedded – for better or for worse.”Sophie O’Brien, chief executive of Pollen Careers, which caters for early-career and entry-level roles, said AI had “accelerated” a decline in graduate recruitment that has been going on for a few years now: “The job market could look vastly different in even a year’s time.”She added: “For a lot of professional, desk-based jobs where you are processing information on a laptop it’s entirely obvious that a huge number of those jobs over the next few years are going to be redundant. There’s a workforce crisis that is going to happen and I don’t know if we are ready for this.”4.Learn AI skills nowDavid Bell, at the executive search firm Odgers, said law firms are demanding AI competence from graduates. “As part of the interview process for the graduate intake they are asking them about their understanding and usage of AI,” he said. “Anyone who has not been using ChatGPT or the equivalent will struggle to be taken on board.”James Milligan, global head of Stem at recruitment multinational Hays, agreed. “If they do not have that second skill set around how to use AI then they are definitely going to be at a disadvantage,” he said. “Jobs don’t die, they evolve and change. I think we are in a process of evolutionary change at the moment.”Chris Morrow, managing director at Digitalent, an agency that specialises in recruiting AI-related roles, said that rather than the technology taking jobs it was creating a new category of AI-adjacent positions: “It is opening windows to jobs that did not exist 12 months ago, like AI ethics and prompt engineering. New roles are being born.”With such demand for expertise, universities are being urged to adapt courses accordingly. Louise Ballard, a co-founder ofAtheni.ai, which helps companies adopt AI technology, says there is a problem with “basic AI literacy skills” not being taught in higher education.“You people are not getting the training they need,” she said. “The skills required at being good at AI are not necessarily the academic skills you have acquired.”The real risk, said Morrow, was not that AI takes jobs but that educational institutions and government policy fail to keep up. “Universities need to embed AI learning across all their subjects,” he said.5.Graduates are using AI to apply for jobs - but should take careAI is an obvious aid for filling out CVs and forms as well as writing cover letters. Many of the organisations contacted by the Guardian reported a surge in applications now that filing one has become easier.Bright Network said the number of graduates and undergraduates using AI for their applications has risen from 38% last year to 50%. Teach First, a major graduate employer, said it plans to accelerate use of vetting processes that don’t involve writing to reduce the impact of computer-drafted entries.The ISE’s Tyler warned that excessive use of AI in applications could results in employers ending recruitment campaigns early and targeting specific groups with recruitment work. Ending such drives early could also affect under-represented groups, she said.Errors that were once seen as red flags might now be seen in a different way, says James Reed. “In the old days we used to screen out CVs that had spelling mistakes because we’d think the person isn’t paying attention to detail or is approaching things with a casual mindset. Now if you see someone’s CV with a spelling mistake you think: ‘Wow, that’s actually written by a person – it’s the real thing.’”6.Consider applying to smaller businessesSmall-to-medium-sized enterprises, or businesses that employ fewer than 250 people, were also singled out as an opportunity for graduates.Pollen’s O’Brien pointed out that SMEs are the biggest employers in the UK,at 60% of the workforce, and any lack of AI knowledge on their part could present an employment opportunity.“A lot of these businesses don’t know how to use AI, they are scared of AI and there is a huge opportunity for young graduates to be bringing those skills into small companies that are still hiring,” she said. “If you bring these skills into a small business you could revolutionise that business.”Dan Hawes, co-founder of the Graduate Recruitment Bureau, said there were thousands of “under the radar” employers below the level of big corporates who were “desperate for brainy individuals”.“There is this huge, hidden market and it gets rarely reported,” he said.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Graduate careersWork & careersComputingChatGPTfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For Brics, heft matters. It now counts 11 member states – includingIndonesia, which joined this year – representing half the world’s population and40%of the global economy,outpacingthe G7 by $20tn.Yet its size hides its contradictions. The grouping’s call for moreinclusiveglobal institutions sounds welcome, but there is a preponderance ofautocracieswithin its own ranks. Brics is right thatinternational lawshould be upheld in Middle Eastern conflicts. But it climbs down from its moral pedestal bycondemningUkraine’s strikes on Russian infrastructure – while staying silent on Moscow’s relentless attacks on civilians.The acronym “Bric” – Brazil, Russia, India and China (South Africa wouldn’t join until 2010) – began as a Wall Streetbeton rising powers challenging the west. But whatdefinesBrics today is a subtler, more strategic ambition: to insulate themselves from Washington’s gravitational pull while cooperating to build a joint hi-tech industrial base. There are things that the Brics get right. Financial global institutions such as theInternational Monetary Fundare in need of reform; the rich world has failed tohonourclimate finance promises. The group’s understandable response in the face of inaction is to create its owndevelopment bankto promote a form of green industrialisation.A pre-summitagreementon a formal collective Brics stance on funding climate action will help. Rapid growth in renewable energy means fossil fuels now account forless than halfof the bloc’s total electricity generation. Given the climate emergency, such progress can only be welcome. Brics memberstatesnow lead ingreen techand boast booming consumer markets – offering both the tools and the scale to drive industrial growth.The postwar order stood on three pillars: US dominance, hydrocarbons and open trade. Today, all three are cracking, largely because of the US itself. Many Brics nations have little to gain from backing oil when the world’sbiggest producer is the US. Donald Trump’sthreatof higher import duties on the bloc’s members speaks to the US turn against global trade. By placingtariffson Brazil over its internal politics, Mr Trump turns economic diplomacy into personal vendetta – and highlights how the rules-based order is unravelling.This moment presents both a challenge and an opening. Tariffed in the west, Chinese firms pivot to Brics. So the United Arab Emirates cashes in – winning local production and techtransfersfrom Beijing that the west won’t permit. Brics’ vision of smart, clean growth fits the gaps in the global order. But it isn’t united:Russia’sgreen potential is buried under itsfossil fuel policy.Saudi Arabiahedges – flirting with Brics while clinging to the US, with deals in the balance. Most of the group’s member states are nervous that a powerfulChinacould tower over the rest. Strikingly, however, its leader, Xi Jinping, did not attend this summit.The Brics nations can still close ranks. Their most technical yet revealing move is to start building financial “plumbing” to bypass western systems. The group isn’t ditching the dollar – but its members know what exclusion feels like: India hadcreditdenied after the 2008 crash; Iranian banks have beensanctionedsince 2012. The bloc’ssuccesswill depend not just on ambition, but on the capacity to coordinate across national interests.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But they marked the beginning of a new era that calls for actionSun 13 Jul 2025 07.00 EDTShareFive years ago, the entire world changed when we saw George Floyd’s body on the pavement, a knee pressed into his neck – a murder, in broad daylight. Others might have simply witnessed a horrific incident, but Black people saw ourselves, and what it’s like to live with a knee on our necks at all times. Because George Floyd wasn’t the first – and unless we uproot this system, he won’t be the last. The police have gone so far as to remind us of this by killingmore people each yearsince George Floyd.But the uprisings of 2020 didn’t erupt because of one killing. They were the breaking point of centuries of violence and neglect. Trayvon Martin. Freddie Gray. Sandra Bland. Oscar Grant. Breonna Taylor. Dreasjon Reed. Ma’Khia Bryant. Ahmaud Arbery. And far too many others whose names never trended. The message was clear: we’ve had enough.Diversity statements flooded inboxes. DEI initiatives exploded. The country saw its first woman of color as vice-president. We even saw Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leaders make symbolic gestures, such as kneeling in kente cloth. It seemed like maybe, just maybe, we were being heard.Zohran Mamdani won by being himself – and his victory has revealed the Islamophobic ugliness of others | Nesrine MalikRead moreBut in hindsight, those gestures weren’t signs of transformation – they were proof that we weren’t being heard at all.We weren’t asking for slogans painted on the streets, Pepsi commercials, or Black and brown faces in high places. We were demanding something much deeper: a total transformation of our economy, our politics and our communities. We were demanding the right to live long, healthy lives without the constant threat of poverty, policing, racism or abandonment.Instead, we got aBiden administration, elected in large part because of the largest protest in American history for racial justice, telling us: “Nothing will fundamentally change.”The so-called allies may have ignored us. But our demands were not ignored by everyone.The oligarchs – and Trump’s new regime – didn’t ignore us. They heard us loud and clear and prepared for war. Their greatest fear was that our uprisings might become a revolution. And that fear has shaped their response ever since. That’s how we entered this new era of authoritarianism and counterinsurgency, on a road paved by Democratic administrations that sought to suppress and co-opt the very movements that put them in power.Police are killing with impunity.2024 was the deadliest year for police violencein more than a decade: 1,375 lives taken. In spite of liberal efforts to make police more accountable with oversight boards, consent decrees and “community policing”, the police have seen their budgets increase by billions of dollars nationally.While we demanded better wages, affordable housing, divestment from fossil fuels, and community-based solutions rooted in healing and care, elected officials, even in some of the nation’s most “progressive” cities, answered with punishment and surveillance. In 2024, when young people wanted theircolleges to divest from war and genocide,they were met with brutalityand police repression.We wanted peace, and we were met with violence. They continue to meet us with tear gas, armored vehicles and curfews. They are banning books, censoring classrooms and undermining democracy at every turn.Now, in the streets of Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Chicago and all across the country, people are rising up to resist Ice. The people are back outside, losing their fear of standing up to a self-fashioned oligarchic dictator.Made in AmericaSome say Trump is borrowing from the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini’s authoritarian playbook. But the truth is, these tactics weren’t borrowed – they were made in America. The United States has long perfected the machinery of repression, exporting it abroad and inspiring apartheid regimes and fascist movements across the globe.We are not witnessing the arrival of fascism. We are watching it evolve and expand.What’s changing now is the scale – and the widening net of American fascism. The technologies and tactics once used to crush resistance in marginalized communities are being expanded and deployed against anyone who dares to dissent – even white liberals and poor and working-class white communities who once believed Trump would shake the system in their favor.We are not witnessing the arrival of fascism. We are watching it evolve and expand.And let’s be clear: this authoritarian turn didn’t begin with Trump. It was built – brick by brick – in Democratic strongholds.Our home state of California helped lay the foundation with its prison boom and decades of “tough on crime” policies, ranging from the Step Act of 1988 to “counteract gang violence” to the Los Angeles police department’s Operation Hammer, which devastated Black communities. Even Obama’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing – a so-called reform initiative – helped entrench modern policing by giving it a friendlier, and in many cases deadlier, face.While Trump didn’t create this system, he is accelerating it – weaponizing the bipartisan machinery of policing, surveillance and incarceration into one of the most militarized domestic regimes we’ve ever seen.Just look at what’s inthe federal budget:$46.5bn to build border walls through cities and ecosystems$45bn for immigrant detention– enough to quadruple Ice’s capacity$15bn for mass deportations, even of unaccompanied children$16.2bn to hirethousands of new Ice and border patrol agents$12bn to reimburse states such as Texas for violent anti-immigrant programs likeOperation Lone StarThat’s more than $130bn for locking people up, tearing families apart and building walls. That kind of money could cancel student debt. End homelessness. Fully fund universal childcare. But that’s not where their priorities lie.Because this was never about public safety – it’s about control.And now, with Trump promising to eliminate consent decrees – those rare federal checks on violent police departments like Minneapolis’s – it’s clear what direction they’re headed: more fear, fewer rights, less oversight and more power in the hands of the few.But, after the largest protest movement in modern American history, how can so much money go towards punishment? What happened from 2020 to now?Some say it was effective counter-organizing. Others suggest that it was the backlash against racial justice movements gaining ground. Here, it’s also important to assert another part of the story, animated by liberals and exploited by conservatives: copaganda.The machinery of misinformationThe state doesn’t just expand power through budgets – it does it through stories.In the bookCopaganda: How Police and the Media Manipulate Our News, we’re reminded that police departments aren’t just enforcers; they’re storytellers. They spend millions shaping public narratives: crime is everywhere, cops are heroes, the system is broken but fixable.Grassroots organizers are scraping together funds for one communications hire, if that. Police departments, on the other hand, run full-blown media operations.The New York City police department spent more than $4.5m in 2023 on its public information office alone, with staff dedicated to managing press, cutting footage and shaping public opinion. The LAPD has its own media relations division with more than 25 PR officers. Ice and Customs and Border Protection pay multimillion-dollar firms to launder their image.These agencies aren’t waiting for a crisis. They’re controlling the narrative before it even happens.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

It’s marketing.Copaganda is how initiatives such as Proposition 36 passed in California, when liberal media played right into the hands of the powerful, manipulating votes for a “smash and grab” crime wave that is overblown. The Yes on Prop 36 coalition spent a combined $16m on ads and organizing to get Californians to undo decades of progressive criminal justice reform.We lost progressive district attorneys. Police budgets continued to grow. And somehow, even with all of this, our streets are no safer because of it. Because we know that the punishment bureaucracy does not keep us safe.But we saw something else, too.In the middle of collapse, when the system failed us here in Los Angeles through the climate catastrophe of the fires, and five years before that with Covid, it wasn’t the police who kept us safe. It was us. Regular, everyday people.We showed up. We cooked for each other. We ran mutual aid. We protected elders. We de-escalated conflict. We passed out masks and sanitizer. We built safety while the state built walls. That wasn’t just survival. It was vision.Some of that vision is still being built.We don’t just need better laws; we need a different foundation. One rooted in care, not cages. In justice that heals, not just punishesIn Oakland, the local community justice group CURYJ launched the Youth Power Zone, a community-designed hub offering workforce development, healing spaces, and leadership for formerly incarcerated and system-impacted youth. It’s what public safety looks like when it’s rooted in love, not punishment.In Los Angeles, grassroots formations such as CAT 911 (Community Alternatives to 911) were leading trainings on how to de-escalate conflict, treat bullet wounds, administer aid to people overdosing and keep our neighbors safe.Across California, the Crises Act is funding community-based emergency responders who show up for people in mental health crises, without a badge or a gun. It’s a life-saving alternative to 911, and proof that we don’t need armed police to keep people safe.These aren’t theories. They’re happening. And they deserve full public funding – not just pilot grants, but sustained resources that match the scale of the need.George Floyd left his house on 25 May expecting to come home. Breonna Taylor was going to wake up the next morning beside her beloved partner. Whenthe SEIU leader David Huerta was abducted by Iceduring the LA immigration raids on 6 June, he was fully expecting to go home that evening. Mahmoud Khalil was expecting to be there for the birth of his son. The system made sure they didn’t. That wasn’t just a tragedy. It was a reflection of what this country is designed to do to Black people. To poor people. To immigrants. To anyone deemed disposable, or a threat to the established order. Everyone is disposable under imperialism.This current administrationdoes not care if you are a poor immigrant who wants to find work, a first responder, a father just trying to get by, an Ivy League graduate student or a labor leader for one of the largest unions in the country. If you are in the way of the order of things, you are a problem, a threat, a target. They go out of their way to remind us that we are less than human. All of us.We don’t just need better laws; we need a different foundation. One rooted in care, not cages. In justice that heals, not just punishes. Because justice without care is just control by another name.A revolution or just a rebellion?The uprisings of 2020 were a rebellion. The question now is: will we do the revolutionary work?Organizing is so important in this moment. We’ve seen everyday people stand up to Ice and prevent deportations. We’ve seen students demand accountability from their institutions. We’ve seen school teachers defend their students, unions go on strike and abolitionist organizers building wherever they are.The powers that be are afraid, and they should be. This means we have to fight. It means we have to go outside. It means we must resist them. They can’t kill a resistance. You can’t kill an idea.That means not just resisting state violence but taking responsibility for building the world we actually want. It means feeding people. Holding space for healing. Creating alternatives to policing. Protecting trans kids. Fighting fascism in our schools and streets. And refusing to let our elected officials trade our lives for talking points.We have to organize. Fund community safety. Back mutual aid. Tell better stories.And keep fighting like our lives depend on it – because they do.2020 wasn’t the end. It wasn’t just a flashpoint. It was the beginning of a new era. The messy birth of the world we want to create, and the death of the current one.What’s giving us hope nowThe people haven’t stopped fighting. Whether it’s students standing up to police repression, neighbors running mutual aid, community members defending immigrants against Ice or organizers building community safety from the ground up, we’re still here. Still resisting. Still building. And we haven’t lost our belief that another world is possible, even when the system slides deeper into fascism.Eric Morrison-Smith is executive director of the Alliance for Boys and Men of Color.

But its legacy is loud: a reckoning with risk, glory, and the radical idea that women can choose bothSun 13 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Jul 2025 05.01 EDTShareThere are two salient pictures of the Katie Taylor–Amanda Serrano trilogy: Taylor walking to the ring on Friday night under the green, orange and white bars of light, her neck like a tree trunk, eyes fixed ahead with stoic grandeur asEven Though I Walkplayed overhead – and the image, hours earlier, of Yulihan Luna bloodied and bruised, standing beside a ring girl whose hoisted breasts had been shellacked in oil, smiling rigidly at a camera that wasn’t looking at the fighter.That’s boxing. That’s also being a woman.At Madison Square Garden – half cathedral, half Thunderdome –Katie Taylorapproached the ring like a martyr. Her arms stayed low and still, her expression stony, the moment at once subdued and transcendent. I am not religious. I was personally rooting for Serrano. But when I heard that worship music and saw Taylor ascend and bow between the ropes, I seemed to see stars as tears blurred the lights of the Garden’s lofted ceiling into a constellation: The Fighter.A spectacle like this ought to be mawkish. But it isn’t. Because when the song ends, two women risk their legacies, their health, their lives – however unlikely – to feel something like greatness. And unlike most sports, in boxing, the risk is not metaphorical. The danger is useless. It protects no country. No one is conscripted. But it underwrites everything that feels noble about this violent, anachronistic art. And when women, historically deemed too fragile to fight, headline an iconic arena that has never before granted them that right, the danger takes on a new meaning.View image in fullscreenKatie Taylor walks to the ring to fight Amanda Serrano on Friday night in New York.Photograph: Al Bello/Getty Images for NetflixThey say styles make fights. They also make stories. Taylor, the pride of Ireland, is all monkish discipline and point-winning speed. Serrano, the southpaw from Puerto Rico by way of Brooklyn, combines firepower with grit. One boxed her way through 15 years of amateur pedigree, the other turned pro at 19 and never looked back. Both are in their mid-30s, both single, both quiet. Sainted recluses with 17 world titles between them and a lifetime of sacrifice.If Taylor is the tactician, Serrano is the flamethrower. This polarization is what produced lightning in the first two fights. But by Friday night, their plans of attack had changed. Serrano, seeking alternatives after two contentious decisions that didn’t go her way, tried to outbox the boxer. Taylor, burned before in brawls, circled and struck, then slipped away. From round one, it was clear: this was no longer a firestorm. The fight bore more resemblance to Mayweather-Pacquiao than Ali-Frazier I. Smart. Tactical. Controlled. For some, disappointing.But why do we need chaos to believe in a woman’s greatness?In other sports, I root for my team to win, ugly or not. But in women’s boxing, I confess to a double standard: I want glory and a good show. I want drama, blood, something irrefutable. That fear – that if women don’t entertain, the sport will vanish – lingers like smoke above the ring. But Taylor and Serrano were not performing for our approval. They were fighting to win.This, in itself, is progress.View image in fullscreenKatie Taylor and Amanda Serrano react after Friday’s fight.Photograph: Noam Galai/Getty Images for NetflixTrue equality in boxing is not the right to inspire. It’s the right to be boring. To clinch and move. To fight safe. To win ugly. Taylor-Serrano III wasn’t transcendent because it was thrilling. It was transcendent because it didn’t have to be.And yet boxing remains a sport of contradictions. To protect yourself, you must risk everything. To gain glory, you court death. And still – some would deny women the choice to do so.When Amanda Serrano and more than a dozen elite fighters issued a joint call last year for 12 three-minute rounds – the same as men – they framed it not as a demand, but as a right: “We have earned the CHOICE,” they said.The irony is that boxing is one of the only spaces in Western society where a woman can risk her life and be compensated. But even then, OnlyFans logos hover over ring posts and girls in bikinis parade cards while bloodied fighters wait for judgment. Fans call the athletes they flew across oceans to support “autistic lesbians”. Serrano gets seven figures. Some women on the undercard get $1,500 and no health insurance – turning, more ironic still, to OnlyFans for financial security.View image in fullscreenKatie Taylor and Amanda Serrano embrace after Friday night’s fight.Photograph: Ed Mulholland/Getty ImagesWhat do we mean when we talk about choice?We fight for a woman’s right to have a child – or not. But what about the right to bleed for nothing more than self-belief? What about the right to hurt for glory, not survival? Women are told their bodies are sacred, but only in service of others – children, husbands, God. In boxing, they reclaim them. Not for nurture, but for risk. Not for life, but for something more defiant. Not Madonna. Not whore. Something else.Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano did not ask for sainthood. They asked for a trilogy. They made history, then made it again, then closed the book.Now, whether Friday night becomes a watershed or a footnote is not up to them.But for those of us watching, feeling the hush before the bell, the flutter of green, orange, red and blue fabric, the rush when Taylor’s glove was raised and an Irish flag drifted gently down from the upper seats – whether Catholic or atheist, Irish or Puerto Rican, man, woman, or something in between – these two ensured one thing:Watching them time after time after finally time again will do something more than impress you.It will resolve contradictions – between styles, between images of a fight, between even life and death – into a single indelible reckoning.Explore more on these topicsBoxingKatie TaylorUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

Nato must step upSun 13 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Jul 2025 14.18 EDTShareFor 40 cruel and bloody months, Ukraine has fought the Russian invader. Since February 2022, when Moscow’s full-scale, countrywide onslaught began, its people have faced relentless, devastating attacks. Tens of thousands have beenkilled or wounded, millions have lost their homes. Ukraine’s industries, shops, schools, hospitals and power stations burn, its fertile farmlands arelaid waste. Its children are orphaned, traumatised or abducted. Despite repeated appeals, the world has failed to stop the carnage. And yet Ukraine, outnumbered and outgunned, has continued to fight back.Ukrainian heroism amid horror has become so familiar, it’s almost taken for granted. But as Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin,escalates the war, raining nightly terror on Kyiv and other cities usingrecord waves of armed drones, as US support and peace efforts falter, and as Ukraine’s overstretched frontline soldiers face exhaustion, such complacency looks increasingly misplaced. A no longer hypothetical question becomes ever more real and urgent: what if Ukraine falls?Answer: Ukraine’s collapse, if it happens, would amount to an epicwestern strategic failurematching or exceeding the Afghanistan and Iraq calamities. The negative ramifications for Europe, Britain, the transatlantic alliance and international law are truly daunting. That thought alone should concentrate minds.It has been evident since the dying days of 2023, when its counteroffensive stalled, that Ukraine is not winning. For most of this year, Russian forces have inexorablyinched forward in Donetskand other eastern killing grounds, regardless of cost. Estimated Russian casualties recentlysurpassed 1 million, dead and wounded. Still they keep coming. While there has been no big Russian breakthrough, for Ukraine’s pinned-down, under-supplied defenders the war is now a daily existential struggle. That they manage to keep going at all is astonishing.How much longer Ukraine can hold the line, on the battlefield, in the skies, and diplomatically and politically, is in serious doubt. It is short of manpower, ammunition and interceptor missiles. It can still strike back hard. Itsoccupation of Russia’s Kurskregion, and last month’sdestruction of strategic bombersbased deep inside Russia, were remarkable. But such temporary successes do not alter the basic imbalance of power or general direction of travel.Increasingly, too, Ukraine is short of reliable friends, though maybe that has always been the case. Putin has assembled his own “coalition of the willing” – China, Iran,North Koreaand others – to support his war machine. The west’s equivalent, led by Britain and France, is in limbo. Deployment of a military “reassurance force” cannot proceed. Due to Putin’s intransigence and Donald Trump’s incompetence, there is no ceasefire to uphold and none in prospect.Speaking in London last week, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, and Britain’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, regurgitatedfamiliar pledgesof unflinching support. That’s easy. Effective military assistance is harder. Like other European countries, the UK and France lack the advanced weapons and materiel, in the quantities required, that only the US can supply.Attempting to fill the gap, Friedrich Merz, Germany’s chancellor, proposes to buy US Patriot batteries andgift themto Kyiv. Yet like the EU as a whole and last month’s Nato summiteers, Merz’s priority is national self-defence. As he measures out missiles for Ukraine, he’s trebling Germany’s defence spending. The UK is doing much the same.Trump, the US’s surrender monkey, remains Kyiv’s biggest diplomatic headache. His lopsided 30-day ceasefire plan wasrejected by Moscow, his proffered US-Russia commercial deals spurned. After months of slandering Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and sucking up to Putin, the “very stable genius” has concluded the Russian leader, an indicted war criminal,talks “bullshit”and cannot be trusted. Well, fancy that.Trump now says he will resume limited supplies of defensive weapons to Kyiv and may back additional sanctions. But this is not about policy or principle. His ego is damaged. Hisfeelings are hurt. One flattering word from his smirking Kremlin bro could turn him around in a flash. Like all bullies, Trump instinctively favours the stronger party. Little wonder Putin calculates he can wear down Ukraine, outlast the west and win the war.Ukraine war briefing: Trump poised to send weapons under Biden-style drawdown, say sourcesRead moreAll is not lost. With or without Trump, Nato could take a tougher line, as repeatedly urged here, by imposing air exclusion zones over unoccupied Ukraine and targeting incoming missiles and drones. The military position is clearcut, the legal and humanitarian case is unassailable. Russia frequently infringes the sovereignty of Nato neighbours. Putin’s attempts at nuclear blackmail, which sounnerved Joe Biden, are contemptible. If it only had the balls, Nato could put him back in his box.Failing that, new US and EU sanctions targeting Russian oil exports should be imposed without further delay. Billions of Kremlin dollars held by western banks should be expropriated to pay for arms and reconstruction. Fence-straddlers such as India thatrefuse to sanctionthe Kremlin and profit from the war should be invited to read the European court of human rights’shocking new reporton Russian war crimes savagery – and told to pick a side.Two outcomes now seem most probable: a stalemated forever war, orUkraine’s collapse. Defeat for Ukraine and a settlement on Putin’s hegemonic terms would be a defeat for the west as a whole – a strategic failure presaging an era of permanent, widening conflict across all of Europe. For Russians, too, neither outcome would constitute lasting victory. Greater efforts are needed to convince Russia’s politicians and public that this war, so costly for their country in lives and treasure, can be ended through negotiation, that legitimate security concerns will be addressed, that the alternatives are far worse.But first, they must give him up. The chief architect of this horror, the principal author of Russia’s disgrace, must be defanged, deposed and delivered to international justice. Putin, notUkraine, must fall.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionRussiaVladimir PutinEuropeDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Canvas bags were festooned with the lightning font of AC/DC and Led Zeppelin, lined up outside classrooms as far as the eye could see. And then there was my bag, with “Life is God” in big bubble writing along the flap, the smell of the permanent marker filling my head with the feeling of floating heavenwards on the wings of truth.I was prepared to be scorned, spat upon, ridiculed. There was nothing I wanted more than to be persecuted, like the early Christians, in order to prove my devotion to God.Devotion has its roots in the Latindevovere,to vow. It goes beyond love, implying an active, passionate desire to prove one’s love. Swifties know what I mean.In a culture obsessed with positive thinking, can letting go be a radical act? | Nadine LevyRead moreDevotional practices extend back hundreds of years before pop stars began cashing in the human inclination to revere. Thirteenth-century Christian flagellants would whip each other to atone for sins and share in the suffering of Christ, their saviour.Devotion can be a jealous kind of love. According to the Jewish Torah, Abraham was prepared to kill his own son Isaac when Y-w-h asked him to, stopping before the blade nicked Isaac’s skin only when Y-w-h spoke from the heavens and told him he had passed the test of love. Devotion to Christ, Allah, Shiva, Vishnu and a range of other gods has long been manipulated by powerful elites to motivate sectarian violence.But devotional practices do not have to be violent. Well known for its pantheon of divinities, Hinduism offersbhakti,the way of devotion, as one of the possible paths tomoksha– liberation from the cycle of reincarnation. Popularbhaktisects follow Vishnu or Shiva and their various avatars, and followers engage in devotional practices such as yoga, self-purification, chanting and temple worship. A devotee expresses and develops her connection to her chosen avatar in the role of mother, father, brother, sister, daughter, lover.Devotional practices are still core to world religions (and modern fan culture) because of, to quote Céline Dion, the “power of love”. Devotion brings together human emotion, story and intent, weaving ever stronger ties to group and godhead. Without devotion, religion becomes a dry intellectual exercise, inadequate to motivate people to acts of heroism or sacrifice. Hinduism has a tradition ofjnana,a path tomokshavia philosophical study and contemplation. But, as my 13-year-old self intuitively knew, it’s hard to develop spiritual fervour for a philosophical construct. “Life is Hope in the Face of the Impossibility of Knowing For Sure if the Universe Has Purpose” just doesn’t fit on a backpack.Even some schools of Buddhism, a famously non-materialist tradition, allow followers to cultivate devotion to figures such as Kuan Yin, a bodhisattva of compassion. Islamic Sufi poets such as Rumi, and Christian saints such as Gertrude the Great, or Teresa of Ávila, wrote devotional works about God as their divine lover. The Tao Te Ching makes no mention of a godhead, but that hasn’t stopped religious Taoists from deifying Lao Tzu, the text’s author.On balance, I would have to say that religious devotional practices to a specific godhead are no longer for me. In the years since I let my backpack speak on my behalf, I have left behind institutional religions. I dislike the idea that there is a “being”, no matter how metaphorical, to whom I owe allegiance. I still bow to the awesomeness of nature and cosmic mystery. But ducking my head to a god feels, well, blasphemous.I no longer wish I was an early Christian like Saint Peter, asking to be crucified upside down, because I wasn’t good enough to die the way Jesus did. As a non-religious pastoral care practitioner, I sit with my co-workers for 10 minutes or so at the start of each day. We share a quiet, contemplative space, preparing ourselves to be present. Some of my co-workers are Christian; sometimes, they pray. I listen, part of me wishing I could feel what they feel. When they finish, I whisper along with them, “Amen.”Jackie Bailey is the author of The Eulogy, the winner of the 2023 NSW Premier’s literary multicultural award.

Sooner or later, something will have to giveSun 13 Jul 2025 07.51 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Jul 2025 14.23 EDTShareIt was a hot day in July, but the headlines felt as if they could have come from any day over the last six months. While the dependably shrill TV channel GB Newsasked its viewerswhether negotiations with France “could signal a shift towards closer ties with the EU”, Keir Starmer and his colleagues were in final talks about so-called small boats. Before he got to the diplomatic details, the BBC’s Nick Robinson boiled down the views of millions of Britons to the deathless cliche: “Why don’t we just send them back to where they’ve come from?”Kemi Badenoch was about tomake a speechabout restricting non-British nationals’ access to disability and sickness benefits – another instalment, it seemed, of her toxic quest to divide people into“makers” and “takers”. Terrifyingly, Nigel Farage’s Reform UK colleagueswere talkingabout focusing their belief in Elon Musk-style budget-cutting on children with disabilities. In the searing heat, everything felt as if it was fusing together to form the usual picture – of a stroppy little island, full of mistrust and loathing, and an angry chunk of the electorate now so huge that politicians of all parties must not just respect its collective wishes, but implement them in full.Ten days earlier – and bear with me here – I had spent three days in a rather different political atmosphere, among the multitudes at Glastonbury. Even before all that controversy had erupted over the Irish rappers Kneecap and the hitherto-obscure duo Bob Vylan, the buildup to the festival had already seen a burst of hostile commentary about Glastonbury’s political side. “Could we please drop the nonsense that it is countercultural, at the bleeding edge of interesting, against-the-grain, perhaps even revolutionary, sentiment?” asked one rathersilly piecein the Telegraph. To which the correct and rather complicated response would be yes; with notable exceptions – from the ubiquity of Palestinian flags, through the debates and discussions in the festival’s Left Field, to everything that happens in the area called Green Futures. But here’s the thing: even if you largely accept that Glasto has long become an ordinary part of the cultural mainstream, that’s actually what makes it so interesting.How does the right tear down progressive societies? It starts with a joke | George MonbiotRead moreWe are long past the point where the crowds there represent an avowedly radical subculture, which was the thrilling sense I got when I first went there (in 1990, which was a very long time ago indeed). Now, the people who go – from hard-partying twentysomethings barely cognisant of the need for a tent, to festival veterans in sensible outdoor gear who carefully plan each day’s bands and go home to jobs in the public sector – are a microcosm of a vast and ever-growing part of the UK population, which is why so many people try to get tickets, and so many thousands watch it on TV. We are talking, essentially, about the Britain – or, more specifically, England – that will never, ever belong to Farage, and the mixture of kindness, ease with modernity and fuzzy liberalism that defines it.There is a kind of progressive cringe that gets in the way of acknowledging this fact. But while the media class focuses almost exclusively on a bundle of cliches about “hero voters” in “red wall” seats, this new England now sits at the heart of our politics. It explains why the Conservative presence in the commuter-belt home counties isshrinking fast, and the list of seats represented by the Lib Dems includes scores of traditional Tory heartlands – something Badenoch does not seem even dimly aware of. For Labour, millions of liberal, left-ish voters define a story of rising dismay about Starmer’s government, and the fact that it islosing more supportto the Lib Dems and Greens than it is to Reform UK. The Green party now has MPs in rural Herefordshire and rural East Anglia, andrecord-breakingnumbers of councillors.Much as opinion polling remains a somewhat dismal and unreliable science, there are plenty of issue-specific statistics that paint the same picture. Even if they are presented as a way of somehow getting people into work, 40% of usare against new limitationson disability benefits. Despite politicians’ reluctance to say so,45% of British adultsthink Israel’s actions in Gaza are genocidal. Forty-nine percent of people “strongly support” a wealth tax. Contrary to the idea that everyone outside London, Manchester and Bristol has an essentially Farage-ist view of human movement,45% of usthink that immigration into the UK should either increase or stay the same. Sixty-one percent of people eitherstrongly or “somewhat”support the government’s net zero target, with only 12% ticking the “strongly oppose” box.Despite Reform UK’s apparent monopoly on explanations for our fragmenting party system, all this is central to why everything is in such a massive state of flux. The Lib Dems are nowalmost neck and neckwith the Tories in the polls. The Greens are now steady, on about 10% – a figure that would surely rocket upwards if they improved their dire PR skills. Moreover, adding these parties’ share of support with Labour’s usually gets you close to 50%, which only highlights how misplaced the popular idea of a seethingly reactionary country irrevocably on the path to a Reform UK government really is.As orthodox politics buckles and fragments, it feels as if, sooner or later, something will have to give. The latest manifestation of the strain Westminster orthodoxy is under is the new leftwing force beingfitfully formedby Jeremy Corbyn and the former Labour MP, Zarah Sultana; but I am not sure it will quite meet the moment. If we were in some alternative universe where our party system mapped on to people’s views, a modern party of the liberal left would not be hard to envisage. Its style of politics might fall somewhere between Ed Davey and the former Green leader Caroline Lucas.Though it might not be radical enough for some people’s tastes (mine included, possibly) it would speak clearly about the climate emergency, be proudly and loudly European and be carefully redistributionist. Crucially, it would spurn the politics of resentment and scapegoating, and confidently fight Farage – and, for that matter, Reform-ish Tories such as Robert Jenrick – on territoryLabourrefuses to go near: the modern right’s views about the UK and its history, who is and isn’t British, and all the rest.This would, perhaps, be the kind of party many people – not least in the Guardian – are always willing the Labour party to become, even though that never seems to happen. As much as any political force could, it would speak for millions who now see the political centre being dragged further and further away from them, and quietly recoil. I see this new England every year at Worthy Farm in Somerset. Most importantly, it reveals itself whenever I visit the relevant swaths of the country.

That doesn’t mean I want them banished from my lifeRachel ConnollyAs Britain’s birthrate falls, hostility towards children in public spaces seems to be rising. That’s sad for all of usSun 13 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Jul 2025 14.15 EDTShareIt struck me recently that, as a woman in my 30s, I am almost never asked about my plans to have children. Even in the few instances I have been, the question arose naturally in a related conversation and each time, when I said “Oh I don’t think I want children”, the other person responded politely and didn’t push any agenda.We could draw conclusions on what this says about other people’s impressions of my lifestyle or my mothering instincts. But let’s choose to see this anecdote in a positive light. I imagine that, even as recently as 10 years ago, I would have had to endure endless hectoring and intrusive comments about the so-called “biological clock”. Or about ending up lonely in my old age or having a life which feels somehow empty or unfulfilled, as if that never happens to people with children.I think I don’t really get asked this because now fewer of us are having children. Last year, the fertility rate in England and Wales (which measures how many children are born per woman during her childbearing years) wasthe lowest on record, at 1.44 children. The number of babies born was also the lowest it has been since the 1970s. Figures like this are usually bandied about as a source of doom and gloom regarding the state of the world. People are not having children only because they can’t afford to, we are told, or because they fear impending environmental collapse.No doubt this is true for some people. But this focus may eclipse another, more straightforward reason: more of us are realising that if we don’t want children we simply don’t have to have them. In the space of a few generations many (although not all) of the restrictions placed on women’s lives, in particular, have been dropped. It is commonplace for women to go to university and pursue the career of their choosing. The pressure to have a family has lessened. And I think the relief of that pressure is worth celebrating. (After all, in our time of environmental and social collapse we must take our silver linings where we can find them!)Still, I have wondered recently if one negative corollary to these changing norms is a pervasive and growing anti-child sentiment. I notice it everywhere. There is constant social media discourse about the annoyance of having to interact with children in pubs or cafes or parks. Now we’re into school holidays I can detect the grumbling ramping up. There are noticeably more children in my local pub as some of the regular patrons have started families. It often feels as if a war is brewing, with locals of all ages hissing and whispering, their eyes narrowed if families leave 15 minutes later than the child curfew.Occasionally there is bad behaviour from the parents too. Recently a few dads brought a group of eight or so children of various ages to spend a sunny day inside watching a football match they were clearly not interested in. Naturally they all charged around the pub like horses in a western, barging into people and knocking over glasses. But I think we can accept there will be bad examples of every demographic and that this group would have had a great time at the park.It isn’t just that one pub. There wasa story recently about more pub landlords, facing a tough climate in the midst of the cost of living crisis, choosing to ban young children from pubs to manage this tension. I empathise with the difficult position they feel they have been put in. But to me it feels like a choice they shouldn’t have to make. Quite often now, too, when I’m in restaurants or cafes, if a parent enters with a child or a pram, people start tutting and muttering, or rolling their eyes. God forbid if the baby starts to cry, as babies do. It strikes me as very rude and also counterproductive. If you greet an adult in a hostile way you won’t get the best out of them. Why would it be different for a child?Even as someone not primarily affected by all this tutting and muttering I find it tiresome. It feels melodramatic, joyless and, dare I say, also quite childish. Consider too that, in general, women still do the bulk of childcare. What do we expect them to do? Sit in the house all day wearing black, pushing their babies back and forth in one of those metal Victorian prams with the big spokes, so the rest of us needn’t be troubled by their existence? Is it really such a big deal to hear a baby briefly cry in the afternoon in a pub? If that is the price to pay for their mum being out and about in the world I think it’s a more than fair one.It feels strange, to me, to draw us all into two camps of “has children” or “doesn’t have children”. Those labels cover such a vast array of different lifestyles and choices, as well as circumstances which are sadly forced, rather than chosen. But whether or not we end up having children, it serves us well to consider how we welcome families of young children into our public spaces. After all, few of us end up living a life completely “free” of children. My own isn’t. As I come into my 30s the women around me are having children. I already have two godchildren. I have a feeling I might end up with 10 or so. And if I’m ever rich, maybe I will hire them all a holiday villa when they turn 18 and they can bond over the honour of having me for a godparent. I imagine I’ll end up with nieces and nephews too. Or stepchildren. Who knows? Time brings all kinds of different, unexpected relationships into our lives.The children I see about in the cafes or pubs in my neighbourhood are a part of the community like anyone else. The idea of public spaces cleanly absent of children seems to speak to a fantasy of a world where the lives we live are totally detached from the lives of the people around us. But of course they aren’t. And if this fantasy were reality, our lives would be very small and boring.Rachel Connolly is the author of the novel Lazy CityExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionFamilyChildrencommentShareReuse this content"

The bestselling author explains why now is the perfect time for romanceIrvine WelshSun 13 Jul 2025 07.00 EDTShareIwas born in the great port of Leith. Stories are in my blood; listening to them, telling them. My family were typical of many in the area, moving from tenement to council scheme, increasingly further down the Forth estuary. I was brought up in a close community. I left school with practically no qualifications. I tended towards the interesting kids, the troublemakers. All my own fault. I was always encouraged to be more scholarly by my parents, who valued education. But I left school and became an apprentice technician, doing a City & Guilds course. I hated it. I was always a writer: I just didn’t know it. I cite being crap at everything else in evidence.It’s why I’ve never stopped writing stories about my youth and my go-to gang of characters fromTrainspotting. Their reaction to events and changes in the world helps inform my own. They’ve been given substance by people I’ve met down the decades, from Leith pubs to Ibiza clubs.But I have never seen myself as an author. If I wrote purely for publication, and let it become a franchise, it would just be another job, albeit an enjoyable one, and better than digging coal. But I never wanted it to be that. As far as I’m concerned, I’m awriter. I de facto retired from the world of work over 30 years ago, packing in my day job at the council to pursue my hobbies of writing and music. If I had the inclination for franchise building, I would have released my books sequentially, in a temporal order, following the characters’ lives. If I wanted to chase literary prizes, I’d have written the kind of novels expected to appeal to the people who judge such affairs.Basically, I wait until something inspiring emerges – theme, event, character or storyline – to act as a catalyst and pique my interest infinallywriting up my notes, sketches and stories to publishable standard. Skagboys was the first thing I wrote, appearing on my Amstrad word processor as the opening sections ofTrainspotting. The resulting book was way too long, so I threw away that first part, opting to take the reader right into the drug-addled world of Renton, Sick Boy, Spud and co, all the way back in 1993.When I got older and more reflective, I thought I’d revisit how the protagonists got into the state they did before Trainspotting: I’d write about the Thatcherite destruction of the traditional working class. SoSkagboys(2012) revisited old territory. But in the meantime, I had leapt ahead almost a decade into those characters’ lives withPorno(2002). I saw that book as being about the increasing commodification of sex, as we moved into the internet age. Way further down the line,Dead Men’s Trousers(2018) was inspired by my experiments with the drug DMT, and the even more astonishing phenomenon of Hibs winning the Scottish Cup.And now I’m back with those characters again.Men in Love, taking place directly after Trainspotting, opens on a junk-sick Renton sweating in an Amsterdam hotel room with his bag of cash, with Sick Boy ferreting around London on the perma-hustle, Spud and Second Prize back in Leith, trying to avoid heroin and alcohol – the drugs that chose them – and Begbie a guest of HMP Saughton. As the title suggests, Men in Love is mainly about that time in life when men (generally in their mid-20s) start taking the quest for romance more seriously.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The ‘village’ of old replaced by the shouty swamp of online lifeNovels, no matter how well researched, composed or projected, are always – whether you like it or not – at least tangentially about you. Writing Men in Love made me realise that, when I stop running away from it, I’ve usually enjoyed love unquestioningly, without feeling the need to analyse or even understand it. The checklists of dating apps, articles, self-help books, the inventories of salient points of attraction, ideal types and red flags always seemed to me a boring, algorithmic and reductive response to a very human, mystical phenomenon. Much of what I’ve learned about love has been experiential, not observational, about not being gun-shy and diving in when the opportunity presented itself. And yes, some romantic sensibilities have been augmented by the imagination and insight of various novelists, from Jane Austen to James Kelman.Looking back now, it strikes me that your mid-20s is a strange time to be embarking on serious romance. Linked to traditional modes of commerce, procreation and survival, we remain culturally bound by such influences, driven to “settle down”. Once ossified in our social structure, such imperatives are now fading, and perhaps it’s about time.For men in their mid-20s, the influence of your partner suddenly becomes greater than that of your peers. It also seems that, in an atomised, narcissistic society, we are left less equipped than ever to meet our bonding needs. The nurturing “village” of old is replaced by the shouty swamp of the online experience, where people are compelled to create ludicrous personas that they can’t live up to in reality. No wonder so many people can no longer be bothered with the whole business. I’m often astounded thatanyrelationships take place at all.View image in fullscreenBad boys … Ewan McGregor and Johnny Lee Miller in Trainspotting.Photograph: Cinetext Collection/Sportsphoto/AllstarMen in Love is my attempt to look at where men go wrong (and maybe sometimes right) in our efforts to subjugate our own pulsating needs to do daft, fabulous things like watch sport, get drunk and obsess about obscure musical offerings, for the greater good of romance, commerce, status, procreation, sex, and yes, L-O-V-E; whatever the motives for joining together with someone are.I think it is as much – probably more – a book for women, who acutely understand the nutters they went out with in their “bad boy phase”, as it is for such men (and I still count myself as only a semi-reformed version of that breed) to understand themselves. It’s a crazy, romantic, joyous journey through our higher aspirations, and the inherently ridiculous mortal stupidity and selfishness that constantly undermines them.Things have changed since I wrote Trainspotting. The working class (like the middle class and the government) no longer have any money, trades or careers; just a patchwork quilt of precarious, low-paid jobs waiting to be destroyed by AI. Some deal drugs. This is usually not really for profit, but youths – like the preening oligarchs who dominate the world – need compelling drama. They engage in meaningless turf wars, constantly in search of their own dopamine hits to distract from the uselessness society has pushed them into; an existence of eating rubbish and watching crap on screens, bloating into obesity as their mental health crumbles. The working class are no longer represented by any political party. They have no voice: nobody will write about them, make films about them, far less advocate for them. They are expected to die quietly.Why publish Men in Love at this time? I think we need love more than ever. Loads of it. Orwell wrote: “If there is hope, it lies with the proles.” I think now, if there is hope, it lies with the lovers.Men in Love by Irvine Welsh is published by Jonathan Cape on 24 July.

Under occupation from March to September 2022, a Russian guard was posted on the door – but invaders never transported its collection any deeper behind Russian lines, or found the rare early 18th-century volume of the gospels – one of only three of its type – that museum workers had spirited away and hidden.The museum is now back in Ukrainian hands but remains in a fragile, vulnerable state, uncomfortably close to the frontline and the threat of reoccupation. The roof is repaired, says the director, Halyna Ivanova, but there is no point re-glazing the windows while the city is hit night after night by missiles.The bulk of thecollection has now been safely evacuatedand its precious volume of the gospels, which was also concealed from German invaders during the second world war when the museum and its collection were almost completely destroyed, is being conserved after its time in hiding.View image in fullscreenHalyna Ivanova, the director of the museum of local history in Izium, showing modern art works presented at the museum.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianAt the moment, the institution is a kind of ghost museum. Its collection is absent; its doors are closed to the public because of the danger of attacks; and its community, whose collective memory it holds, has shrunk to half of its 40,000 pre-invasion number.But there is still much work to do, says Ivanova. The museum staff now run walking tours of the city’s shattered historical buildings. They host temporary exhibitions inside damaged rooms (“loft style”, she jokes, of the rough walls and improvised feel), even if its visitors are now confined to local military personnel and invited guests.“We are trying preserve memories, to fix them,” she says. “To show people how the city was before the war, what has happened to it – and how it looks now.”On display are paintings by local artists, and photography by soldiers stationed nearby, part of a nascent collection of audio, video and images from the military that the museum is amassing.Map of eastern Ukraine, showing Russian-controlled areas, Izium, Sviatohirsk etcOne room holds a display devoted to significant local individuals. One is the murdered children’s writerVolodymyr Vakulenko, who buried his diary of life under occupation beneath a cherry tree in his village before being arrested and shot dead. Another is “a firefighter who was also delivering aid around the city, who died as a result of a cluster bomb”.Ivanova says: “He was my neighbour and I knew him all his life; I saw him born and I saw him die.”She is also building a “museum of occupation”: collecting objects left by the invaders. “So there is proof of their presence here – and proof of the crimes they committed.”Some of this new collection is on display. There is part of a cluster munition rocket; the uniforms and helmets of Russians, as well as those from the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, a part ofUkraineoccupied since 2014; Russian ration packs and cigarettes – “brands I haven’t seen since I smoked them 30 years ago before the fall of the Soviet Union”, says Ivanova.View image in fullscreenThe objects of the Russian occupation of Izium and Kharkiv region at the museum of local history.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianAntique-looking crutches and superannuated tourniquets attest to the out-of-date supplies of some of the invading army. There are aid packs branded as donated by the Russian tank manufacturer Uralvagonzavod; school textbooks for primary-age children showing Russia as the motherland and Moscow as “the capital of our country”; and fragments of a stone-carved memorial erected to mark the grave of a Russian colonel “that shows”, says Ivanova, “that they thought they were going to stay for ever”.Propaganda news sheets are on display, as is a photograph of a visit by a prominent Russian propagandist surrounded by local collaborators. “One is in Russia, one is being searched for by police here, and the two women are in prison,” says Ivanova.There is evidence of some bleak humour: a homemade Russian medal crudely carved from a piece of wood and awarded “for all this shit”.View image in fullscreenThe view over the Sviatohirsk Lavra monastery and the Artyom monument on the hill.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianThe Izium museum is not the only such institution to be in a vulnerable position. Farther south, in the Donetsk region, lies the great monastery complex of the Sviatohirsk Lavra, rising dramatically up from the cliffs above the Siverskyi Donets River.Farmers turned soldiers, fields full of mines and a rural exodus: how Russia is punishing Ukraine’s countrysideRead moreThe site, which has medieval origins, is shared between monks and nuns of the Ukrainian Orthodox church and has a museum run by the Ukrainian state. (The church, which has historic ties to Moscow, declared its formal separation from the Russian Orthodox church in 2022, though many observers consider the separation incomplete or ambiguous.)Displaced people are living in buildings that form part of the estate, some of whom have been here since 2014, when Russian-backed separatists occupied parts of the region.View image in fullscreenYaroslava Diedova, deputy director of the museum, at the monastery of Sviatohirsk Lavra.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianYaroslava Diedova, the museum’s deputy director, lost her boss to the Russian invaders. The director and her family were killed when their car was hit by a missile as they tried to evacuate.Four monks were also killed when a missile smashed into one of the monastery’s accommodation blocks in March 2022, and three construction workers died in a later attack, says the monastery’s Fr Trofim.View image in fullscreenA monk before an Orthodox icon of a saint at Sviatohirsk Lavra monastery.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianThe town of Sviatohirsk, across the river from the monastery, was occupied by the Russians in June 2022 and the bridge linking them was blown up; when Diedova came back to work after it was recaptured by Ukraine that September, it was an 11km walk to work via another bridge, until they organised a boat and finally a new bridge was built.View image in fullscreenThe battle-scarred monument to Artyom, the Bolshevik revolutionary Fyodor Sergeyev, on the hill in Sviatohirsk.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianOn a hill next to the monastery’s great rock stands a 22-metre high concrete sculpture of Artyom – the nickname of the Bolshevik revolutionary Fyodor Sergeyev. The colossal statue became a Ukrainian reconnaissance and gun position, and the area around it is heavily mined.The sculpture, scarred by shrapnel, is exempted from Ukraine’s decommunisation laws – which would otherwise demand its removal – because of its status as a significant artwork by the early 20th-century Ukrainian sculptor Ivan Kavaleridze.These days, part of the job of the museum, says Diedova, is to host creative workshops for refugee children living at the monastery, as well as guided tours for soldiers, “because it’s important to show them what they are actually fighting for. Those who come from the region have generally visited as children, but now there are soldiers from all across Ukraine here.”Sometimes the soldiers pause to pray in the churches, “then they come here to the museum and drink tea and talk; there is a chance for a sort of psychological unloading”, says the new director, Ihor Saletskiy.“Compared to some of the museums in the Donetsk region, who can transport their collection anywhere, we are a little different. Our main objects are the caves, the churches – not movable things. That’s why we’re staying here, and working with the monastery,” he says.Back in Izium, despite the general air of ruin, the fountains are working in the park and school leavers, dressed in their prom outfits, are posing for photographs against the backdrop of their once-handsome school, now a battered shell.View image in fullscreenOleksandra, a graduate, celebrates her prom party, posing for a portrait in front of her ruined school in Izium.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The Guardian“We are living as we lived before: the only difference is that we have to run for the basement at night,” says Ivanova. Compared with the hunger, terror and isolation of life under occupation, she says, it is nothing.“There is always the possibility that the Russians will come again,” she says. “If they do, this time it will belike Bakhmut: they will erase it.”The work of the museum is, she says, “to save the city in some way – if necessary, in people’s memories”."

The villa is the same, overly lit and filled with dumb neon signs, looking like it was exclusively decorated by Target (the contestants are still obliged to call it beautiful as they enter, leaving audiences wondering if they are told by producers to do so). There is the same introduction of personalities that at first seem complex and different, only for everyone to fall into a high school trance once they start vying to be chosen. There is the same suspension of any kind of reality for the most part, in which the contestants rarely discuss the real-world implications of their lives, such as their jobs and living situations.But this summer saw Love Island USA truly take off, breakingratings recordsand storming social media (new viewers reportedly made up 39% of the season 7 audience). Peacock, the NBC-owned streamer, boasted that the show was the most talked about TV event of the season with 623m video views on TikTok. Yet in the UK, the original has beenstruggling, with ratings lows. Perhaps it’s down to fatigue, with the show having been around almost twice as long overseas. At the same time the US equivalent has been boosted by an overall rise in interest for live event TV (the past year has also seen awards showsreceive an upliftin viewers) and the past weeks have seen Love Island watch parties crop up in bars across the country. But why now?‘Oh my God sir, you’re on Love Island!’ What happens to teachers who do reality TV?Read moreIt has all of the same horny plot twists we expect, but this season somehow grew a heart. The antics are still as naughty, but the sexy singles of the villa are honest about what they want (at least until they start coupling up). And what they want is genuine intimacy fueled by emotional vulnerability and availability. People seem to be actually looking for real love, long-term commitment, seeking people with real partner potential, and even discussing having children in a deep way. Add on the complexity of one of the contestants Huda having a daughter, and the fearful way she navigates the topic, and you have people being real for once on a very unreal show.Part of the allure of this season is that gen Z has finally taken the torch of what millennials started (and I say that as a very exhausted millennial). These contestants are fluent in gen Z-speak. They say “dead ass”, “type shit”, “be so for real”, “hits different”, and “tea” as if no one didn’t ever know what those words meant. They are covered in tattoos and piercings, and no one bats an eye. These people grew up with social media, and it shows – and somehow, instead of being entirely off-putting, it’s more relatable than the millennials who came before them, who were constantly angling for the camera’s attention while overthinking how they were coming off in the public eye. There’s an effortlessness of this new young generation who came of age so filmed by their own phone cameras that they don’t seem as concerned with the production crew’s POV, or even the fact that they’re being watched. The ennui and cultural frustration of millennials is eclipsed by gen Z women who don’t feel the need to go so high glam with their style, and men who are excited to talk about their feelings. It’s a refreshing energy.View image in fullscreenMichelle ‘Chelley’ Bissainthe, Olandria Carthen, Iris Kendall, Amaya Espinal and Huda Mustafa.Photograph: Peacock/Kim NunneleyIt all translates into a collective self-awareness that while they could become famous just by being there, and especially by staying on as long as possible, showing any interest in that is off-putting and will get them kicked off and also disowned by the public. This is probably informed by watching online backlash against other reality dating show contestants in the last few years who were exposed for being there just for fame, but also feels like a generational shift. This generation is also far more mental-health aware, and watched as the early seasons of the UK show were tragically plagued by suicide and mental health crises, and it has helped to create islanders who avoid the pitfalls that they can trip into in approaching the game for fame or by being emotionally ugly (getting cliquey, being blatantly disloyal, trying to pull focus, being overtly manipulative). They have become smarter about how they come off on camera by not playing into it at all. Authenticity is king in this generation. No one is pretending to be smarter or hotter than they are. And they don’t necessarily seem to be comparing themselves to one another, more just not wanting to feel rejected. It helps that the format ofLove Islandis almost real-time, with just a 24-48 hour delay from filming to air. It reduces the noxious vibes of over-produced reality TV that everyone at this point knows is anything but real.This season has also seen some controversy with contestants being kicked off. Yulissa Escobar was axed unceremoniously in the first week after an old podcast episode resurfaced in which she had used the N-word. She apologized for the comment on her social media accounts, but alsocritiqued the online backlash against heras “cancel culture”. Cierra Ortega left last week with narrator Iain Stirling saying she “left the villa due to a personal situation”, after two social media posts circulated in which she’d used a slur against people of Asian descent. As opposed to Escobar, Ortega has apologized profusely, with her family evenputting out a statementbefore she returned home about the harm they were afraid the mass, vocal backlash against their daughter could cause to her mental health.As the season comes to a close this weekend, producers were alsoreportedly upsetwith OG islander Huda, who is in the finale to potentially win the prize, for posting a TikTok lip-syncing to a Elijah The Boy’s Over You, for a portion that includes the N-word. She will apparently not be kicked off ahead of the finale, but was pulled aside by producers and admonished and asked not to cause any more controversy for the brand or herself. The lack of self-awareness certainly has a downside for these gen Z’ers who have lived their youths sometimes regrettably too online. But at the same time, it’s part of what stokes viewers. With the rise of shows like The Traitors, also reaching a record audience in the US, it seems people are wanting a return to a messier brand of reality TV.View image in fullscreenChris Seeley and Huda Mustafa.Photograph: Ben Symons/APWhere does the present-day Love Island obsession come from? Is it just wanting to get away from the crushing reality of the geopolitical climate? There’s no longer a layer of disdain for young TV dummies grinding on each other just to get internet famous. Love Island isn’t just a guilty pleasure or a hate watch anymore. Now we are rooting for them. We want them to win. We wish we could be them, or be there for them. When they say they’re there for “girls girls and soul connections”, we believe them. A day after talking about how the show was a salve for our chaotic times with a friend, I saw a meme of the2023 Barbenheimersummer box office moment, with an image of Margot Robbie’s Barbie looking out over Barbieland next to an image of Cillian Murphy’s Oppenheimer looking out over an atomic wasteland with the text overlay “Watching Love Island while simultaneously watching WWIII start.” It’s how we all feel, like a meme of the world wrapped into a person who just wants to live.The biggest appeal of Love Island has always been the quickness with which these people will couple up and catch feelings for each other after mere hours together, and then turn around and transmute that into the same thing with someone new whom they just met. There’s something wildlydeluluabout it, but also kind of how we all want to be loved – for it to be instant. For someone to pick us. For someone not to want to take it too slow. For someone to make us feel easily chosen for the long haul. The bonding exists entirely in this neon, sexed up faux paradise where the pressures of the real world don’t exist (what we all wish we could return to). It’s a sleepaway camp for adults with the promise of global attention, and the joint potential for a soul mate and a cash prize. Take that original recipe and add in this new gen Z natural charisma and lack of anxiety around being vulnerable, garnish with universal trauma around the state of the world, and you have the perfect storm to lose months of your life watching a single season of this show. Happily ever after for us all.Explore more on these topicsLove IslandUS televisionTelevisionReality TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If it’s a wild party and there’s a whole bunch of drugs involved, it’s gotta be uptempo.

She is a Threat to Humanity, and should remain in the wonderful Country ofIreland, if they want her.”The threat – which lacks an obvious legal pathway and raised further questions about Trump’s use of executive power – escalated a two-decade public feud between the pair.O’Donnell moved to Ireland earlier this year after Trump won a second White House term but they have continued to trade barbs.“You are everything that is wrong with america,” O’Donnell posted on Instagram, hours after his threat. “You want to revoke my citizenship? go ahead and try, king joffrey with a tangerine spray tan i’m not yours to silence i never was.” Joffrey is a villainous king in Game of Thrones.The actor also posted a 1980s-era photograph of Trump with Jeffrey Epstein, amidrenewed attentionon the president’s relationship with the disgraced financier.Explore more on these topicsCultureIrelandDonald TrumpSocial mediaEuropeDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

But, in the early hours of 3 July, the portraits were slashed and daubed with green paint.News of the attack led to community groups involved in the exhibition receiving support from all over the world, said Ros Griffiths, the chair of Friends of Windrush Square, with about £5,000 donated to an online fundraiser at GoFundMe in a week.The fundraiser has not yet met the £15,000 target, which meant the restoration work was only possible with a loan, Griffiths said, but organisers were keen to see the exhibition restored quickly, and would keep the fundraiser open.Griffiths added: “Even though we did not achieve our target, we still went ahead and restored the portraits on credit because the stories couldn’t wait. But we still ask everyone to continue to support the campaign to reach our goal, because every contribution helps to honour the legacy of our generation with the dignity and visibility it deserves.“The public’s response was overwhelming. The exhibition went viral. Messages of solidarity poured in from across the UK and beyond, as far away as Tokyo, any way they could connect with us, they did – people who had never set foot in Brixton.

The equalities minister, Seema Malhotra, visited the scene this week.The exhibition features a portrait ofClovis Salmon, one of the oldest members of the Windrush generation, who died recently, which gave this year’s Windrush Day celebrations an added poignancy.In a post on GoFundMe, Ed Errington, of Empathy Museum, said: “This exhibition is more than just images. It’s a proud and public celebration of the Windrush generation and their descendants – a space for collective memory, recognition, and resilience.”TheMetropolitan policesaid they arrested a 24-year-old man on Saturday 5 July, on suspicion of vandalism, and that he was taken to hospital due to concerns for his welfare.He was further arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated criminal damage and possessing articles with intent to destroy or damage property, although officers added that “based on additional inquiries”, they did not believe the incident is racially motivated, but are continuing to “explore all possible motives.”This article was amended on 13 July 2025. The exhibition features a portrait of Clovis Salmon, not Clovis Samuel as an earlier version said.

Later photograph: Pål Hansen/The Guardian. Styling: Andie Redman. Hair and makeup: John Christopher at Arlington Artists. Archive image: courtesy of Kerry GodlimanBorn in London in 1973, Kerry Godliman is a comedian and actor. She trained at Rose Bruford Drama School, before taking a course on standup comedy at the adult education college City Lit. In 2012, she was cast as Hannah in Ricky Gervais’s Derek, and has appeared in dramas including Save Me, Adult Material and Trigger Point, along with pursuing her career in live comedy and radio. Godliman hosts the Memory Lane podcast with Jen Brister, and is one of the judges of theComedy Women in Print Prize. She is married to actor Ben Abell and they have two children.This was taken at my mum’s 40th– a big house party where everyone dressed up. I was going through a 60s phase with the dress, the hair and the eyeliner – all of which was probably inspired by Deee-Lite. There would have been a lot of drinking and smoking and good music. Pretty raucous all round.I felt suburban and strait-laced during my childhood, but as I’ve got older I’ve realised my parents were quite bohemian. My dad was a violin-maker and worked in the shed, and my mum was a secondhand clothes dealer who was always studying something new. When it came to work, she wasn’t risk-averse and collected interesting people as friends. There was never anyone around our house who had an office job – no accountants popping in. I must have taken that on board when I chose my career. Being self-employed is all I knew.At the time this photo was taken, I was doing my GCSE retakes and about to start my A-levels. I may have failed some exams, but I don’t remember being that stressed about it. My general attitude was: “If I don’t get the grades, I’ll just do them again.” This picture captures my laid-back mindset perfectly.In my teen years, I was very committed to the local youth theatre in Ealing. It gave me a lot of my creative joy and a real sense of identity. Instead of doing musicals, we were more interested in gritty pieces about HIV. We once made a safe-sex video for Ealing council, during which I played a mum wearing an awful wig and chain-smoking. Not that that was too out of character. For the best part of a decade, there isn’t a photo of me without a fag in my hand.There was a lot of banter in my family and my childhood was a lot of fun. We watched tons of comedy on telly, especially Victoria Wood and Billy Connolly. I also enjoyed making the grownups laugh, which led to me wanting to try standup. I think if my parents hadn’t indulged me by laughing so much I wouldn’t be doing what I do now. There was also Miss Friend, a teacher at school, who was always encouraging. She once wrote in a report: “Kerry’s good, and she could pursue acting for a job … if she doesn’t muck around and waste too much time.”I followed the traditional pathinto acting: I got one line in The Bill, a couple of scenes in Casualty. It was very incremental and bitty. There were lots of “nearly” moments in my 20s – I nearly got a job at the Royal Shakespeare Company, and I nearly got a nice lead in a sitcom. While it was affirming that I was on the right path, there was also a feeling of never being quite enough. But I don’t resent it – that feeling is what pushed me towards standup comedy in the end.Once I discovered standup, I threw myself at it, because I wanted to get better. I loved Victoria Wood, so always assumed I would do character comedy, but I quickly realised that on stage, I had to be me. Or a cartoon version of me. One that’s slightly heightened, hyperbolic and nutty.It was very exciting when I got the email from Ricky Gervais about playing Hannah in Derek. It wasn’t the usual cattle-call that actors get, he just asked me: “Do you want to play this part?” I’ve always been too shy to ask him how he knew about me in the first place – but he loves standup, so he would have seen me on stage at some point, and I had sent in an audition tape for The Office. After Derek, he gave me a scene on Extras and Life’s Too Short. Then came After Life – which was mind‑blowing, because it blew up in lockdown when everyone was incubated. The show has since had a life of its own – even this week, someone came up to me and told me how important the show was to them. I feel very grateful to have been part of a bit of culture that creates intimate conversations between people about grief.I always loved comedians who talkedabout social stigmas, who made human foibles funny. I’m really glad that I’m able to do that with my own standup now. Particularly because I am in the midlife “fuck it” years, where you have limited bandwidth to hold everything together, so you’ve got to let some things go. There are times where I get a bit self-conscious because my standup material is so domestic – but that’s the landscape of my life. There’s always some drama with my knickers or some household frustration to laugh at. Given I am menopausal, there are a lot of emotions to unpick, too. Some days I feel as if I’m drowning, and other days I am blissed-out and feel these are the best years of my life. It’s very cathartic to let it all out in a room with a group of women I suspect are all on the same page.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I thought I’d never find my place in the world, or I’d never meet anyone special. I feel a lot less of that now, but naturally the odd bit of insecurity rises up at times. I’ve never met anyone who doesn’t feel like that. Although I did recently meet a man who said: “Hey, have you ever heard of impostor syndrome?” I was like: “Yeah, I think I’ve heard of that.” Mind you, Ricky is genuinely a fearless person. Has his fearlessness ever rubbed off on me? He has a different profile, he is an older bloke in a world that listens to older blokes. I think sometimes women have had to fight a little bit more for that stuff, but we’re getting there.When you have young kids,youdevote so much of your life to them, so when they suddenly leave and do their own thing, you have to ask yourself: “What should I do now?” At the moment, I am doing a lot of standup, which is great, but it can get a little lonely when you’re on tour. I’d like to do more theatre, too, and I still love acting, even if it’s unpredictable. I didn’t get a job that I really wanted the other day. It was humbling, but I’m definitely better at rolling with the punches than I used to be. I’ve had more experience, and I have faith that something else will come along. My daughter has now decided she wants to get into acting. I’m like: “I hope I haven’t failed my kids by showing them that it’s perfectly normal to have this precarious, up-and-down lifestyle!”As for big fancy house parties, I can’t remember the last time I went to one. My kids’ generation doesn’t seem to do them. Or maybe I’m just not invited!Explore more on these topicsKerry GodlimanFlashbackFamilyPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Our research shows that a small number of divisive accounts could be responsible – and offers a way outJay Van BavelSun 13 Jul 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Jul 2025 11.26 EDTShareWhen I scroll through social media, I often leave demoralized, with the sense that the entire world is on fire and people are inflamed with hatred towards one another. Yet, when I step outside into the streets of New York City to grab a coffee or meet a friend for lunch, it feels downright tranquil. The contrast between the online world and my daily reality has only gotten more jarring.Since my own work is focused on topics such as intergroup conflict, misinformation, technology and climate change, I’m aware of the many challenges facing humanity. Yet, it seems striking that people online seem to be just as furious about thefinale of The White Lotusor the latest scandal involving a YouTuber. Everything is either the best thing ever or the absolute worst, no matter how trivial. Is that really what most of us are feeling? No, as it turns out. Our latest research suggests that what we’re seeing online is a warped image created by a very small group of highly active users.In apaperI recently published with Claire Robertson and Kareena del Rosario, we found extensive evidence that social media is less like a neutral reflection of society and more like a funhouse mirror. It amplifies the loudest and most extreme voices while muting the moderate, the nuanced and the boringly reasonable. And much of that distortion, it turns out, can be traced back to a handful of hyperactive online voices. Just 10% of users produce roughly 97% of political tweets.Let’s take Elon Musk’s own platform, X, as an example. Despite being home to hundreds of millions of users, a tiny fraction of them generate the vast majority of political content. For instance, Musk posted1,494 timesin his first 15 days of implementing government cuts for the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge)earlier this year. He was, essentially, writing non-stop. And many of his posts spread misinformation to his 221 million followers.On 2 February he wrote, “Did you know that USAID, using YOUR tax dollars, funded bioweapon research, including Covid-19, that killed millions of people?” His behaviour fits the pattern of many misinformation super-spreaders. A mere 0.1% of users share 80% of fake news. Twelve accounts – known as the“disinformation dozen”– created most of the vaccine misinformation on Facebook during the pandemic. These few hyperactive users produced enough content to create the false perceptions that many people were vaccine hesitant.Many of us are led to believe that society is far more polarized, angry, and deluded than it really isSimilar patterns can be observed across the internet. Only a small percentage of users engage in truly toxic behaviour, but they’re responsible for a disproportionate share of hostile or misleading content on nearly every platform, from Facebook to Reddit. Most people aren’t posting, arguing, or fuelling the outrage machine. But because the super-users are so active and visible, they dominate our collective impression of the internet.That means the resulting problems don’t remain confined to this small cohort, which distorts how the rest of us make sense of the world. Humans create mental models about what other people think or do. It’s how we figure out social norms and navigate groups. But on social media, this shortcut backfires. We don’t get a representative sample of opinions. Instead, we see a flood of extreme, emotionally charged content.In this way, many of us are led to believe that society is far more polarized, angry, and deluded than it really is. We think everyone on the other side of the generation gap, political spectrum, or fandom community is radical, malicious, or just plain dumb. Our information diet is shaped by a sliver of humanity whose job, identity, or obsession is to post constantly.This distortion fuels pluralistic ignorance – when we misperceive what others believe or do – and can shift our own behaviour accordingly. Think of voters who see only the angriest hot takes about immigration or climate change and assume there’s no common ground to be found.The problem isn’t just the individual extremists, of course – it’s the platform design and algorithms that amplify their content. These algorithms are built to maximise engagement, which means they privilege content that is surprising or divisive. The system is optimised to promote the very users who are most likely to distort our shared perception of reality.It gets worse. Imagine you’re sitting in a busy restaurant, having to speak a little louder just to be heard. Before long, everyone is shouting. These same dynamics happen online. People exaggerate their beliefs or repeat outrageous narratives to get attention and approval. In other words, even people who aren’t especially extreme may start acting that way online, because it gets rewarded.Most of us aren’t spending time on our phones trolling our foes. We’re busy working, raising families, spending time with friends, or simply trying to find some harmless entertainment on the internet. Yet, our voices are drowned out. We have effectively handed over a megaphone to the most obnoxious people and let them tell us what to believe and how to act.With over5 billion people now on social media, this technology isn’t going away. But the toxic dynamic I’ve described doesn’t have to hold sway. The first step is to see through the illusion and understand that a silent majority often lurks behind each incendiary thread. And we, as users, can take back some control – by curating our feeds, resisting the outrage bait, and refusing to amplify the nonsense. Think of it like deciding to follow a healthier, less processed diet.In arecent series of experiments, we paid people a few dollars to unfollow the most divisive political accounts on X. After a month, they reported feeling 23% less animosity towards other political groups. In fact, their experience was so positive that nearly half the people declined to refollow those hostile accounts after the study was over. And those who maintain their healthier newsfeed reported less animosity a full 11 months after the study.Platforms could easily redesign their algorithms to stop promoting the most outrageous voices and prioritise more representative or nuanced content. Indeed, this iswhat most people want. The internet is a powerful, and often valuable tool. But if we keep letting it reflect only the funhouse mirror world created by the most extreme users, we’ll all suffer the consequences.Jay Van Bavelis a professor of psychology at New York University.Further readingThe Righteous Mindby Jonathan Haidt (Penguin, £12.99)Going Mainstreamby Julia Ebner (Ithaka, £10.99)The Chaos Machineby Max Fisher (Quercus, £12.99)Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaThe big ideaPsychologyInternetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Piett was the commander of Executor, Darth Vader’s flagship super star destroyer employed in the Empire’s quest for galactic control.George Lucas, theStar Warscreator and producer, had not intended to feature an Imperial officer twice in the first trilogy, but Colley made the character of Piett human – “You can’t just play a uniform,” he said – and Star Wars fans wrote in demanding to see him again. So Lucas brought him back for Return of the Jedi (1983), adding scenes to the original script. But Colley’s run ended there, with Piett commanding the entire Imperial fleet at the Battle of Endor and perishing when a Rebel starfighter destroys the Executor’s command bridge. He remained a firm fan favourite at Star Wars conventions over the following decades.Colley also gained cult status as Jesus delivering the Sermon on the Mount in the 1979 film Monty Python’s Life of Brian. He had previously appeared with individual members of the Monty Python team in the movie Jabberwocky and on TV in Ripping Yarns (both in 1977).He was also much admired byKen Russelland was part of the flamboyant director’s unofficial repertory company for 22 years. Colley started as Hitler in Dance of the Seven Veils (1970), a BBC musical biopic that outraged Richard Strauss’s family with its sex scenes and depiction of the composer as a Nazi sympathiser.Then came film parts as Modest, Tchaikovsky’s younger brother, in The Music Lovers; Legrand in The Devils, brilliantly cinematic, but controversial – and censored – for its tale of a philandering 17th-century French Catholic priest, witchcraft, nudity and sexually repressed nuns; and a bearded king for a fantasy sequence in The Boy Friend (all 1971).In further Russell musical biopics, Colley was Krenek, a journalist posing challenging questions, in Mahler (1974) and Frédéric Chopin in Lisztomania (1975). He played the dour teacher Mr Brunt in Russell’s film version of The Rainbow (1989) before returning to TV as Alfred Dreyfus, a wrongly jailed 19th-century French officer, in Prisoner of Honor (1991) and the composer John Ireland in The Secret Life of Arnold Bax (1992).View image in fullscreenKenneth Colley as Hitler in Ken Russell’s Dance of the Seven Veils, 1970.Photograph: BBC/RGR Collection/AlamyColley was born in Manchester, to Jessie (nee Hughes) and Ernest Colley, a labourer. When he was 14, a teacher at South Hulme secondary modern school asked him about his career ambitions, and he said he wanted to act. On leaving school, he went through jobs as a commercial art assistant, bus conductor and warehouse operative, but his dream never faded. “One day, I told myself that I was 23 and I had to stop wasting my time,” Colley recalled. In 1961, he headed for London and knocked on theatrical agents’ doors, but failed to impress.Nevertheless, he landed his first theatre job as an assistant stage manager with Bromley repertory company, where he started acting. He also made his screen debut, as a corpse, in the BBC sci-fi series A for Andromeda (1961) in the middle of an actors’ strike that meant most Equity members were not available for work.Moving on, he joined the newly formed Living Theatre company in an old school building in Leicester (1961-63), alongside actors such asJill Gascoine. His performance as Jimmy Porter in John Osborne’s anti-establishment play Look Back in Anger led one critic to write: “Kenneth Colley burns with sardonic rage.”While television quickly recognised his talents as a character actor, with appearances in dramas such as The Avengers (1963), as well as the role of a fellow steel worker playing pranks on Dennis Tanner in Coronation Street (1964), Colley continued on stage with the company at the Unity, a London East End venue with roots in the workers’ theatre movement.He played Wick there in another ”angry young man” play, Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs (1965), written byDavid Halliwelland directed by Mike Leigh. He reprised the role at that year’s Dublin theatre festival and in the West End of London the following year at the Garrick, before taking small parts with the National Theatre company at the Old Vic in 1968.View image in fullscreenKenneth Colley, left, with Bob Hoskins in the BBC’s Pennies from Heaven, 1978.Photograph: Radio Times/Getty ImagesLater stage roles included Cleet in Cromwell (Royal Court, 1973) and Benedick on tour with theRoyal Shakespeare Companyin Much Ado About Nothing (1979). In films, he played Michael Crawford’s chauffeur in The Jokers (1967) and a Soviet colonel in Firefox (1982), alongside Clint Eastwood.He first played Hitler on television in Jean Benedetti’s BBC play These Men Are Dangerous (1969). His other small-screen parts included Charles I in Revolution: Cromwell (1970), the “accordion man” in Pennies from Heaven (1978), an SS officer in the 1983 TV movie The Scarlet and the Black, starringGregory Peck, Eichmann in Wallenberg: A Hero’s Story (1985), and the title roles in I Remember Nelson (1982) and Napoleon’s Last Battle (1990).Colley also gave a standout performance as the manipulating Duke of Vienna in the 1979 BBC Shakespeare production Measure for Measure and enjoyed a starring role as Ken Uttley, owner of a removals firm, in the comedy-drama Moving Story (1994-95). In 2016, he played the doomed mob boss Vicente Changretta in Peaky Blinders.In 1962, Colley married Mary Dunne; she died in 2018.Kenneth Colley, actor, born 7 December 1937; died 30 June 2025Explore more on these topicsFilmStar WarsStar Wars: The Empire Strikes BackKen RussellMonty PythonTelevisionRoyal Shakespeare CompanyobituariesShareReuse this content"

Just an hour north of Bratislava by train, the town and its spa-populated island are packed with grand art nouveau and art deco buildings.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.There’s a faint aroma of sulphur in the air as Igor paces ahead, past peacocks and ponds full of lilies, imparting his home town’s history. The hot water that springs from beneath the island sandbank has created what we’re all here for: a blueish medicinal mud that’s rich in hydrogen sulphide and sulphur.View image in fullscreenIllustration: GraphicsSlovakia is gaining an international reputation for its affordable and high-quality spa treatments. I’m here to visit three of its leading spa towns, travelling entirely by rail. The journey from London is straightforward and took less than 24 hours thanks to the new European Sleeper route that leaves Brussels for Prague three nights a week, and a direct train from Prague to Piešťany.On checking in at the Thermia Palace, the history of this grand 113-year-old hotel and neighbouring Irma Health Spa is immediately apparent. Photographs of maharajas, politicians and singers who have visited are on display, and a painting donated by Alfonse Mucha, the Czech artist whose work defined the art nouveau style, hangs in the hotel’s dining room. His daughter came here regularly for the balneotherapy (mineral-water hydrotherapy), and there is a small museum on Spa Island dedicated to his work.View image in fullscreenMud is prescribed for reducing swelling and inflammationI’m assigned to Dr Alena Korenčíková, who immediately notices I have hypermobility and draws up a personalised programme that includes visits to the thermal bath, filled with sulphuric mineral water, and the hot-mud pool. I’m also prescribed daily CO2 injections. Known as carboxytherapy, this treatment is meant to help muscle recovery and tissue regeneration; my rock-hard shoulders feel noticeably looser afterwards. And finally, I’m prescribed a mud-pack treatment, which is recommended for reducing swelling and inflammation, and nourishing the joints. When I explain that I’m going to Trenčianske Teplice and hope to continue mud treatment there, Dr Alena says: “They have peat, it’s not the same as ours.” Time to fine-tune my mud knowledge.The building is as thrilling as the bathing. Piešťany is just as much about the architecture as the watersAs I submerge myself in the warm cloudy water, my toes squish into the mineral mud that is pumped directly from the mud kitchen (where it’s treated) into the vast circular pool. The building is as thrilling as the bathing. The 19th-century dome above the pool is the spa’s stunning centrepiece, with stained glass art deco skylight windows sitting high up on the art nouveau walls decorated with tiles, floral motifs and cherubs. Piešťany is just as much about architecture as about bathing, it seems.Local architect Eva Rohoňová cements this theory the following day, when she shows me around the extraordinary House of Arts, a colossal piece of 1970s brutalism that houses the town’s concert hall and cultural centre. “It’s far too big a capacity for just people from Piešťany,” she says. “The Czechoslovakian government built it here as the town was full of international visitors. It was to demonstrate the culture.” She has been giving tours of otherwise inaccessible interior spaces to locals over the years, but anyone can arrange one through theVisit Piešťany website.View image in fullscreenThe Sina hammam was designed in the 1880s by an expert on Islamic architecture and decorative artsAfter three mud-packed days, I take a train north to Trenčianske Teplice just outside Trenčín, one of next year’s European Capitals of Culture. I’m instantly taken by the picturesque spa town with its mix of baby pink and peachy orange 19th-century guesthouses and angular 1960s concrete hotels. Daniel Oriešek from the tourist board shows me around. I point out the steady stream of visitors carrying walking poles. “It’s not the Tatras, but people come here for hiking,” he says, alluding to Slovakia’s West Carpathian range which forms a scenic backdrop to the town.The sauna master swirls around splashing orange, lemongrass and yuzu water over the hot coals as pop songs blast out and everyone claps alongThey also come to bathe at the Sina hammam, an ornate Turkish bathhouse that looks as though it could have been teleported here from Istanbul. It was in fact built in 1888 and designed by František Schmoranz Jr, an Austrian architect of Czech origin who had spent several years living in Egypt and was a leading expert on Islamic architecture and decorative arts.I’m ushered in and shown to the pool, where an unexpected delight greets me: a huge socialist-era mural that covers one entire wall. I soak in the water and copy the locals, who splash their faces with water from the source in the middle of the pool. Afterwards, my skin looks and feels fantastic and, with an entry price of just £12.50, I’m already plotting my next visit as I exit the building.View image in fullscreenThe pastel coloured market square of Zilina.Photograph: Marc Venema/AlamyThe next day I catch a train to Žilina, a city in the north of the country, where I disembark to hop on a bus for Rajecké Teplice. It’s a village compared with Piešťany and only has the one spa, Aphrodite, but that spa is truly unlike anywhere else I’ve been. Lovingly maximalist, with Roman-style columns, mosaics and gold decor that glimmers in the crisp spring sunshine, this is the Vegas of spa resorts. “When you are lying on a sunbed on a hot summer day and take a cold dip in the pool, it’s like you’re not in Slovakia,” says staff member Radka Capkova. “Everyone knows Slovakia has lots of spas, but it’s usually older people who want to go. But our spa is so famous that we get younger people here taking photos.”It’s a huge complex of 11 saunas, three restaurants, an outdoor swimming pool and Nature Land, where bathing is naked after 5pm. I feel far too British for this, but wearing a bikini to a sauna is a firm no in central Europe, so I collect a sauna sheet and tuck it around myself like a sarong. Capkova encourages me to attend one of their “sauna ritual” events (orAufguss) and get over the nudity: “No one stares or looks,” he says.40 best spa breaks in the UKRead moreI go to the hottest ritual, where the sauna master swirls around like a figure skater, splashing orange, lemongrass and yuzu water over the hot coals as pop songs blast out and everyone claps along – the camaraderie is so infectious that I quickly forget everyone is naked.“My great-great-grandmother, my great-aunt, my mother, everyone worked here at some point,” Capkova tells me. Rajecké Teplice is the smallest of the spa towns I’ve been to, but it has a big community impact. Spas are just in the blood in Slovakia. “But in the UK you don’t go to the spa?” It’s a question I get asked a lot throughout this week. “We’re working on it,” I always reply.The trip was provided byVisit Piešťany,Trenčianske Teplice Regional Tourism, Spa AphroditeandByway Travel (byway.travel).

But it turned out no number of nights out on Kingsland Road could prepare me for the assault on the senses that was my first meal in the city, crouched on a plastic stool by the roadside and enjoying what Uyen Luu describes as “the irresistible sweet, treacly smell of barbecued patties and caramelised pork”, all mingled with traffic fumes.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The stall in question served one thing only:bún chả, a northern speciality of juicy chargrilled pork, cold, slippery rice noodles, sweet yet deeply savourynước chấmdipping sauce and fistfuls of aromatic herbs. “About as typical and unique a Hanoi dish as there is,”as Anthony Bourdainexplained to Barack Obamaover bowls of the stuff in 2016, there’s something about the way you can pick and mix the different elements to make every bite unique that makes this pure joy to eat.View image in fullscreenFelicity’s prototype perfect bun cha. All thumbnail photographs by Felicity Cloake.Chef and restaurateurBobby Chinndescribes bún chả as “a great example of the art of Vietnamese grilling”, and says it’s made with either “thin strips of pork belly grilled until the meat is slightly crisp and smoky, or as little burgers. I generally prefer the latter, because these burgers are quite unique.” Very often the two options are served together, as inUyen LuuandVy Tran’srecipes, in which pork belly slices are marinated in a mixture of fish sauce, sugar, garlic, shallots and black pepper for several hours before grilling (Tran freezes the meat for 45 minutes or so to facilitate cutting, though a butcher should be able to save you the trouble). Delicious as they are, I’m inclined to agree with Chinn that the pork patties are the real crowdpleasers, so they will be the stars of my recipe, too (if you’d like the whole shooting match, by all means replace half the pork mince with thin strips of skinless pork belly, and divide the marinade between the two).As almost everyone notes, this dish needs to be made with fairly fatty meat, “which helps it”, Chinn says, “retain incredible moisture, simultaneously allowing the fat to melt, sweating the meat with drips of fat into the fire allows for a more smoky flavour”. A minimum of 20% fat is ideal; my butcher makes it with shoulder, which seems to work as well as the belly specified by some writers.View image in fullscreenUyen Luu’s bun cha displays ‘the irresistible sweet, treacly smell of barbecued patties and caramelised pork’.Given the full-flavoured dipping sauce with which the patties are served, my testers prefer those that aren’t loaded with sugar or salty soy or oyster sauce. Luu’s book Vietnam, and Chinn’s Vietnamese Food both start with a caramel sauce, the latter using palm sugar heated until it begins to smoke for a dark, complex sweetness. Though I’m sure he’s right that this is “the one additive that should never be omitted”, in practice, my testers prefer the more savoury, porky patties, which I’m relieved about, because mixing hot sugar syrup and cold pork is more difficult than it sounds. As a nod to those caramel sauces, however (an ingredient I do love inrecipes such asred boat pork belly), I’ve gone for food writerVicky Pham’s brown variety, which, she says “helps to caramelise and char the pork patties and provide a sweet sticky glaze when grilled”. It’s all balanced with a dash of fish sauce; for extra savouriness, you could also pop in a pinch of MSG or powdered stock, as Luu suggests.View image in fullscreenVicky Pham’s bun cha ‘is the only recipe I find that features lemongrass’.I also really like Pham’s chopped lemongrass, but as hers is the only recipe I find that features it (lemongrass is, I’m reliably informed, more common in the cooking of the south), I’ve left it out. Chopped shallots are fairly standard, however (if you go to a specialist supermarket for the herbs and noodles, see if they have small red Asian shallots, which are both more fiddly and more pungent than their larger European counterparts), while Luke Nguyen also adds garlic, chives and spring onion, though finely chopped garlic is more common.The only spice in any of the recipes I try is freshly ground black pepper, but two recipes, from Pham’s website and Nguyen’s book The Songs of Sapa (another extraordinarily beautiful place) use roasted rice powder and beaten egg to bind the patties. I don’t have a problem with them falling apart once the meat has been chilled to firm up, though, so I wouldn’t bother.(Non pork-eating readers could substitute minced turkey or chicken, though their lower fat content means you will probably need to add beaten egg; or trya plant-based versionand report back.)The cookingView image in fullscreenLuke Nguyen adds garlic, chives and spring onion to his pork patty mix.Although the larger patties preferred by Luu and Tran remain juicier during cooking, my testers prefer the convenience and smokier flavour of the bite-sized ones in other recipes, especially when they’ve been cooked on a barbecue. Not that this is the only option: following alternative suggestions from the recipes, I try them, in order of preference: baked (which works, as would an air fryer, though I’d flash them under a hot grill at the end to try to achieve a bit of charring), a frying pan, an overhead grill and, the second best option to getting out the charcoal, a hot griddle pan. As if reading my mind, Tran writes on Serious Eats that, “while it might be convenient to cook the pork in a stovetop grill pan, the result will lack the smoky flavour and char essential to bún chả.” While undeniably true, I promise that either way the results will be so delicious that you’re unlikely to be wracked with regret. (Note, if you do go down the barbecue route, a fish cage will make turning the meatballs easier.)The dipping sauceAccording to Pham, “while the pork is integral to bún chả, it’s the dipping sauce (nước chấm) that makes or breaks the meal”, because it helps bring together the disparate parts into one unified whole. Tran offers a useful guide for novices: “To eat bún chả, taste the dipping sauce first before adding other condiments or accompaniments such as raw garlic or sliced bird’s eye chilli … Add fresh herbs to the bowl and throw a small heap of vermicelli noodles in the dipping sauce. Take your chopsticks and pick up the noodles along with meat, pickled vegetables and fresh herbs.”Nước chấm is based on fish sauce, preferably atraditionally fermented Vietnamese versionthat tends to be less harshly salty than cheaper cooking varieties, and sugar. Pham, who is based in California, also uses a Puerto Rican brand of coconut soda in hers, which is tough to track down in the UK, so I substitute coconut water – but, in the end, most of my testers prefer the punchier, zestier notes of sauces that feature more lime juice and rice vinegar than coconut sweetness. (Vinegar is often provided on the table along with sliced garlic and bird’s eye chilli, so you can adjust to taste.)View image in fullscreenBobby Chinn’s bun cha: ‘Pork patties are real crowdpleasers.’Interestingly, opinions vary as to the desirable temperature of said sauce; Luu, Chinn and Pham serve it at room temperature, and Nguyen and Tran steaming hot, with the latter writing approvingly that atBún Chả Đắc Kimin Hanoi, “the dipping sauce was boiling when the cook ladled it into the bowl containing the meat. Given how fatty the patties and pork slices are, the high temperature prevents fat droplets from coagulating at the top”. According to Mervin Lee of the Michelin Guide Vietnam,it’s a weather thing:“The broth is served cool in summer for a refreshing contrast to the smoky pork and gently warmed in winter, infusing each bite with comforting heat”. In other words, it’s up to you.The pickles and vegetablesNot all the recipes I try include pickled vegetables, but I’m a fan: the vinegar cuts through the fattiness of the pork, while the vegetables themselves add yet another texture and flavour to the party. Green papaya (which you’ll probably need to go to an south-east Asian grocers for) is, I think, the ideal, but as crunch is the point here, thinly sliced carrot, kohlrabi and radish also work well. (If you don’t have time for pickling, Pham’s slices of cucumber or Nguyen’s beansprouts make fine substitutes.)Lettuce leaves are also a nice touch, but the essential thing to finish this dish are herbs – and in quantity. Thoughfish mint and Vietnamese corianderprove elusive even in central London, Thai basil is becoming much easier to find, and perilla (shiso) is increasingly available, too. If you don’t have the luxury of specialists nearby, however, rest assured that the important thing is the punch of aromatics that fresh herbs deliver, so a fistful of fresh coriander and mint will do much the same job.The noodlesView image in fullscreenVy Tran’s bun cha: ‘The smoky flavour and char is essential.’Very little dissent here: rice vermicelli is the move on the bún chả front, though Pham specifies medium-sized round rice noodles (which I misread and end up with medium-size flat rice ones, instead. Worse things happen at sea, as my grandma would say, had she ever had a rice noodle). The noodles are served cold, so you can prepare them, like almost all the elements of this dish, in advance, making it an excellent choice for a relaxed barbecue party.Perfect bún chảPrep30 minChill15 min+Pickle2 hrCook8 minServes4For the patties400g pork mince– not too lean, ideally2 tbsp fish sauce2 tbsp finely chopped shallots4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed1 tsp soft brown sugar1½ tsp coarsely ground black pepperSaltOil, for greasing the griddle or grill bars, and your handsFor the pickles200g carrot, radish (eg, daikon), kohlrabi and/or green papaya2 tbsp rice vinegar20g sugar¼ tsp fine saltFor the dipping sauce150ml fish sauce150ml rice vinegar100g sugarJuice of 5 limesTo serve300g rice vermicelli1 small head of lettuce1 generous handfulmixed fresh herbs– perilla, Thai basil, mint, coriander4 bird’s eye chilli, thinly sliced4 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly slicedView image in fullscreenPut all the ingredients for the patties bar the oil in a large bowl, mix well, then use greased hands to tear off small pieces and roll into bite-sized meatballs.

The British, on the other hand, have always been rather less keen, so it was surprising to hear reports thatLapin, a new French restaurant in Bristol, had been struggling to keep fluffy bunnies on its classic, single-sheet menu due to supply reasons, apparently because its game dealer couldn’t shoot them quickly enough to meet Lapin’s demand. Instead, its diners had had to settle for confit duck leg, coarse sausage and deep-fried pig’s head.Lapin patently aims to offer actual French cooking, albeit stopping short of the likes of pungentandouillette, complete with its tubey innards escaping on to the plate. That said, I’d bet that chefJack Briggs-Horanand restaurateurDan O’Regantinkered with the idea before accepting that serving something quite so smelly in a small, repurposed shipping container was probably one Gallic step too far. I’vementionedBristol’s love of delis and dining spots in former shipping containers before, and here we are again at Lapin, gasping at how, with a little imagination and clever sleight of hand, you can turn an impersonal iron box into a tiny slice of France. The walls are painted a calm, elegant sage-green, there’s a dinky little drinks trolley and aprix-fixemenu up on the wall – £29 for three courses – all whileFrance Gall coos Ella, Elle l’acoquettishly over the speakers.View image in fullscreen‘Who can resist?’: Lapin’s asparagus with sauce gribiche and beurre noisette.I went with Charles, my longsuffering sidekick and a man of French stock, and watched as, after a short debate in French about the booze-free aperitif offering, the French server ended up bringing him a bright green glass ofsweet, minty diabolo, which is the taste of Charles’ childhood. “OK,” I thought to myself, “you guys are good at this stuff. We’re not in Cafe Rouge now.”As we waited for some cheese-stacked comté gougeres with custardy insides and baguette with a mountain of whipped cod’s roe, it dawned on me that, although rabbit didn’t feature among the entrees that day (there’s usually some rillettes), there were tiny, subtle rabbit motifs on the tableware, the servers’ jackets, the wine list and the table. To me, these understated Donnie Darko touches were a delight.View image in fullscreen‘Crisp, hot, generous’: Lapin’s chicken schnitzel with oyster mushroom, chicken wing and madeira jus.Would I recommend Lapin? On the whole, yes, because this is a menu that could thaw the iciest of hearts. Who can resist chunky asparagus with sauce gribiche and beurre noisette, or a very good, fluffily light, but rich-with-gruyère souffle Suissesse? Both were charming to look at and to eat. I erred, however, by ordering the chicken schnitzel with madeira jus, because, although it was crisp, hot, generous and came with an oyster mushroom and a chicken wing, it was a little one-note – that note being “fried” – unlike the colourful Provençal fish stew filled with mullet, prawns and mussels I saw being delivered to other tables.Lapin’s menu might even trip you up. Take the gnocchi Parisienne: if you’d ordered it expecting a sedate plate of Italian-style potato bullets, then buckle up: these gnocchi mean business, because these are plump, fluffy, choux pastry parcels in a stew of braised courgette, mint and creme fraiche. They were also that day’s sole vegetarian main-course option, which was possibly the least French part of the meal, because the French feel about vegetarians roughly the same as Queen Victoriaallegedlydid about lesbians: they’ve vaguely heard of the concept, but don’t fully believe they really exist. Rather boldly, Lapin also offers to add a 5g spoon of caviar or a scoop ofRollright cheeseto any dish for an extra cost (£13 and £7, respectively), which is a nifty little way of turning even the most saintly dish into some arch you-time.View image in fullscreenThe ‘rich’St Émilion au chocolat, at Lapin, Bristol.We skipped the part of the menu markedtrou normand, offering a traditional palate-cleansing glass of apple cider brandy with apple sorbet for £8, and sailed headlong into desserts, where Basque cheesecake sits side by side with theéclair du jour, which on this occasion was lemon meringue;pain perdu, that rib-sticking classic, was also on offer, served with vanilla ice-cream and apple. An almost impossible decision, and one complicated further by aSt Émilion au chocolatin which the rich chocolate cream met crushed amaretti biscuits soaked in sherry.Lapin is a peculiar, meta, slightly earnest, definitely delicious French restaurant that you would never, ever find in France – not least because no one in France would be seen dead eating in an old metal box. But Bristolians are lucky to have it. It’s only early days, and they’re still finding their feet, but mange tout, Rodders, mange tout.LapinUnit 14, Cargo 2, Museum Street, Bristol BS1, 0117-408 4997.
