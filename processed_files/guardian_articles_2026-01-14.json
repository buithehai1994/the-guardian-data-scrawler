Whenever there was any instability in the world, she would joke with her family: “Well we will just go to Greenland, nothing ever happens in Greenland.”But in the past two weeks – during whichDonald Trump has repeatedly threatenedmilitary action on the largely autonomous Arctic territory the US president claims he “needs” for national security purposes, despite it being part of the Danish kingdom – Hegelund, 37, has realised this is suddenly no longer true.“Look where we are today,” she says, laughing incredulously. “It’s just so crazy.”Like many of Greenland’s 57,000-strong population, Hegelund has found herself worrying about evacuation plans in case of US invasion, whether or not to flee toDenmarkbeforehand and fielding questions from her children about becoming American.Others said they have been watchful of the skies and seas around Greenland, tracking US planes on flight trackers and even discussing plans on how best to respond if they were captured. Many said they were suffering from anxiety and struggling to sleep.View image in fullscreenNajannguaq Hegelund, like others in Greenland, is wondering whether to flee to Denmark in case of a US invasion.Greenland, Hegelund says in a coffee shop in the snow-covered capital, Nuuk, has never experienced anything like it. “How do you deal with it when you haven’t experienced anything like that, at all, at any point in history?” she asks.Almost exactly a year ago, Trump talked about the US needing to acquire Greenland – by military force if necessary. Back then, the mood in Nuuk was more lighthearted, verbally combative and sceptical. Today, many are openly alarmed, trying to prepare themselves and their families for what could happen and wanting practical advice from the authorities. The big difference now, says Hegelund, who works monitoring Inuit legal rights for the NGO Sila360, is that there is now the precedent of Venezuela.The prospect of the high-stakes meeting in Washington on Wednesday between the Greenlandic and Danish foreign ministers, Vivian Motzfeldt and Lars Løkke Rasmussen, with the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has brought some relief. It will, it is hoped, mark the start of a proper dialogue.However, some say the last-minute announcement that the US vice-president, JD Vance, will also be involved brings a worrying unknown quantity. When Vance visited Pituffik, the remote US military base in north-west Greenland, in March he said US control of the autonomous territory was critical to fend off China and Russia and accused Denmark of having “not done a good job”.View image in fullscreenThe mood in Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, has changed from lighthearted, verbally combative scepticism to alarm.Trump’s seemingly renewed desire to take Greenland has made headlines around the world, prompting increasingly fraught statements from European leaders and an ever-accelerating stream of dramatic social media content. Yet for most of its residents, this is not a talking point or a piece of content from which they can move on or swipe away. It is existential.If US troops were to arrive in Nuuk tomorrow and lay claim to Greenland, many Greenlanders feel they would be powerless. “What couldwe do?” says Hegelund. “We are like 20,000 in Nuuk. How are we going to go against American troops?”Over the past couple of years, Joint Arctic Command (JAC), the Danish military forces tasked with protecting the sovereignty of the kingdom of Denmark in the Arctic, has run a preparedness course for young Greenlanders in response to the region’s heightened security situation. But many say they lack basic information on what to do in case of invasion.View image in fullscreenHedvig Frederiksen, left, and her daughter, Aviaja Fontain, right, have taken the surveillance of Greenland’s skies and shores upon themselves.Hedvig Frederiksen, 65, and her daughter, Aviaja Fontain, 40, are so worried that they have taken Greenland’s surveillance upon themselves. “It’s scary,” says Fontain, who is struggling to focus on her university exams because of the geopolitical tension. “She [Frederiksen] keeps looking at the planes because she has a view and I keep on looking at the harbour because I have a view to the harbour.” Frederiksen, who uses flight trackers, recently got a scare when she said she spotted a Hercules plane leaving Pituffik and thought it was coming to Nuuk to invade.“If they [the US] take over Greenland, what am I supposed to do then?” says Fontain. “Are we going to have to pay for our studies? Are there going to be soldiers here shooting Greenlandic people?”Frederiksen is one of 143 women who recently won a legal battle against Denmark’s government after being forcibly fitted with IUDs when young by Danish doctors. Speaking through her daughter, who translated, she says: “If the soldiers are coming here, then what will they do? We are all just thinking that they are going to do bad stuff to us because we don’t want to be US citizens or a [US] state.”Greenland, says Fontain, already has the generational trauma of Danish colonisation. “Are we going to have another one?” she says, adding that there is so much on people’s minds. “I hope to God that we won’t be Americans. Trump can just make bases here instead of making threats. It is people’s lives he is talking about and we are not violent here. I’m so afraid if they take over are they going to bring their violence here?”View image in fullscreenA Not for Sale sign in Nuuk.In October, Copenhagen announced an additional 27.4bn in Danish kroner (£3.26bn) for Arctic and North Atlantic security, including for two new Arctic vessels, greater maritime patrol aircraft capacity and a new JAC headquarters.But on the ground there are few visual signs of increased security. The current JAC headquarters looks cosy rather than imposing or threatening. Even the US consulate, an unfenced traditional red-painted building, channels hygge rather than attack.A Danish defence spokesperson says: “It is important to note that almost all military capabilities deployed in the Arctic are mobile in nature.” As a result, they are not necessarily publicly visible in a specific geographic area, he adds.Having finished high school and voted for the first time last year, Aviâja Korneliussen, 19, is part of a generation that has come of age during this unprecedented time of Greenlandic history in which one of the world’s most peaceful populations has come under repeated threat from a military superpower.View image in fullscreenAviâja Korneliussen, an artist, says Donald Trump’s threats are dividing Greenlandic society.Korneliussen, who is an artist and works at a museum and a bar, says Trump’s threats are dividing society. “Before all of his claims it was just an easy life. You had no worries, you were friends with everybody,” she says, eating breakfast in her apartment as the morning fog cleared outside to reveal white mountains. “But now someone has a different idea of how Greenland will be and another has a whole different idea and if they clash you cannot be friends.”She finds the way people talk about Greenland online, as an object to be traded, dehumanising. Amid the global attention, Indigenous Greenlanders are, Korneliussen says, becoming more open to expressing their Inuk identity, including through Inuit tattoos and art, and separating themselves from Denmark: “The whole idea of being Inuk instead of Qallunaaq, Danish.”If the US was to invade, Korneliussen thinks there would be a lot of protest, but she is not sure how people – herself included – would react. “I think I would just lock myself inside and find a way out of here,” she says. But at the same time, she does not want to have to leave her life in Greenland. “It is weird to think about because you don’t want to think about that stuff – like the what ifs and what not. Especially if you have people you care about and it is the land you were born and raised in. The culture that you live every day.”Many Greenlandic people, Korneliussen says, have guns, so people could try to defend themselves. “But at the same time we are not that type of people to go kill one another.”As well as fear and anxiety, there is also a strong sense of wanting to get something positive for Greenland out of the situation.View image in fullscreenOpposition leader Pele Broberg says he wants Greenland to have the opportunity to talk to the US about a free association deal.Photograph: Inesa Matuliauskaite/The GuardianPele Broberg, the leader of Naleraq, the most US-friendly of Greenland’s political parties that came second in last year’s election, says Greenlandic politicians have been asking Denmark for a free association deal with them for decades, but that for the Danish government “there was never a good time”.Now he wants Greenland to have the opportunity to talk about the possibility of such a deal with the US, but that Denmark is telling them they must appear united. “They keep saying we cannot appear divided, we have to appear unified,” he says, speaking in his party office at the Greenlandic parliament, Inatsisartut. “There is nothing for us to be unified about, they want something else.”But on Tuesday, after weeks of repeating similar statements, Greenland’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, changed tone. On the eve of the White House meeting, standing alongside the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, he said: “If we have to choose between the US and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark, Nato and the EU.”Aqqaluk Lynge is one of the founders of the Greenlandic party Inuit Ataqatigiit, a former president of the Inuit Circumpolar Council, and the author of On the Trails of the Inuit. He says this is exactly the message that Greenlanders needed to hear: “That is what we have been waiting for. It’s so good because people are really really tired of this situation. We need at least Denmark and Greenland to be on the same footing in terms of what we are saying.”View image in fullscreenAka Hansen, who wants independence, says Ukraine, Gaza and Venezuela have proven that international law is ‘ineffective’.Photograph: Inesa Matuliauskaite/The GuardianAka Hansen, an Inuit film-maker and activist, says she wants Greenlandic independence whatever happens, but that “we have to be smart around it”. Recent years, she says, have proven – through invasions of Ukraine, Gaza, Venezuela and now potentially Greenland – that international law is “ineffective”. In that sense, she is relying on Denmark’s protection.“Which is weird for me to say as someone who fights for independence that I actually have to rely on Denmark right now,” Hansen says. “But I think those are the facts: that we actually have to have hope that Denmark will make sure that we are secure.”Explore more on these topicsGreenlandUS foreign policyDenmarkTrump administrationDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday evening, the government announced that itwasn’t going to make digital ID cards mandatory after all. Just months after Keir Starmer had made digital ID cardsthe cornerstone of his plansto stop migrants working illegally.It’s getting hard to keep up. At Christmas, we had the U-turn oninheritance tax on farms. In the New Year, we had a U-turn onbusiness rates for pubs. All U-turns that were undoubtedly for the better. All U-turns that came with their own numbing predictability. Almost as if the government hadn’t thought things through. Surely not.History repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce. Politicians and news organisations have been fighting a losing battle in their efforts to keep a running tally. Skymade it 13 U-turnssince Labour took office in 2024.It’s all become a bit of a joke and there is no sign of a letup. It can’t be long before the government has todo a rethink on jury trials. The proposals are as unpopular with Labour MPs as they are with the rest of the country.It was no surprise that Kemi Badenoch used her time at the dispatch box duringprime minister’s questionsto have a go at the government’s about-turns. Why complicate things? Every party leader deserves an easy day sometimes. It must have been the shortest preparation for PMQs Kemi has ever done. Apart from the early days, when shehadn’t appeared to have done any.History repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce. There has been some talk of a Kemi renaissance, but that’s because she is starting from a very low bar. Being slightly more confident than Starmer isn’t actually that great an achievement. The Tories’ poll ratings are still desperate. Kemi being able to stand up without falling over isn’t the win she thinks it is. She is still hanging on to her position as Tory leader by her fingernails. That is her tragedy.As for Keir, it increasingly looks as if the public and his own MPs have lost the faith. He remains in Downing Street only because no one wants the job when an annihilation in the May elections is in the offing. All of which is rough on the man who detoxified theLabourbrand enough to win a landslide at the last election. In theory, Keir should be riding high and able to do what he wants with a massive majority. But he either doesn’t know what he wants or fucks it up when he does. That is his tragedy.Which brings us to the farce ofPMQs. Because both Keir and Kemi have now decided they have had enough of being serious and to play the session for what passes for laughs.Ben Jennings on Keir Starmer’s U-turns – cartoonRead moreTo the first bad gag. Badenoch began with the digital ID U-turn. Didn’t the health secretary have a point when he suggested it would be more helpful if the government tried to get things right first time. It might give the country the confidence to believe Keir knew had some kind of plan, other than one that could be ripped up at a moment’s notice. You can’t sell every U-turn as a sign of a listening government. Wes Streeting wagged his finger. “I never said that,” he shouted. But you sort of did, Wes. Didn’t you?Starmer immediately went on the offensive. When was a U-turn not a U-turn? When he had never intended the policy to be implemented in the first place. Come up with some crap ideas, fool the public into thinking you really meant them, then reverse them and look brilliant … Keir’s voice tailed away. This wasn’t quite the killer line he had imagined.So instead he just started listing all the changes of prime minister, cabinet and policy in the Tories’ 14 years in government. “They’ve had more positions than the Kama Sutra,” he said. “No wonder they’re knackered and left the country screwed.” Yuck. You hope for better than a borderline bad taste dad gag at PMQs. But we are where we are. Apparently we get the politicians we deserve. Lucky us.And it was all downhill from here. Starmer was helped by Kemi’s lack of self-awareness. The Tory leader should know better than to say she was doing just fine and her own backbenchers were thrilled with her. She isn’t and they aren’t. The country is still a long way off forgiveness for their time in office. But Keir just chose to play the rest of their exchanges for laughs. To make no pretence of answering any questions on the direction and capability of the government.He had recently been to the Croydon Ikea, Keir said. No one wanted their shadow cabinet range. Made of dead wood and all the nuts had defected to Reform. Boom, boom. This was unmistakably in the format of a joke but it died a death on Starmer’s lips. He does serious far better than he does comedy. He has no sense of timing.To the next bad gags. These were as much at Nadhim Zahawi’s expense as Kemi’s. But so what? All’s fair in love and war. He had heard he had been offering the Tories some advice just before his defection. Presumably on how not to get a peerage. Keir hoped the Tory leader hadn’t been asking for tax advice. That sound? The sound of one side splitting. Nadhim was part of the secondBoriswave. Reform had turned into a laundry service for every Tory undesirable. Still some way to go there.The contest faded into silence. It had been theatre; nothing more. Am-dram at best. Neither Kemi nor Keir had really given it their all. Which suited Starmer a lot better than it did Badenoch. On days like these, he was happy just to get out alive. Onwards and sideways.Explore more on these topicsPMQsThe politics sketchLabourKeir StarmerKemi BadenochHouse of CommonscommentShareReuse this content"

About 80% of the island’s tree cover has been lost.“When I got out here the next morning, it was still dark but I could see the tree line had changed,” said the head gardener, Darren Little. “As dawn broke, the scale became clear – it’s devastating. In a few hours it destroyed years of work and changed the profile of the island.”View image in fullscreenSt Michael’s Mount lost sycamores, holm oaks, hollies and Monterey pines to Storm Goretti.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianTens of thousands of trees were toppled in the west ofCornwallas gales howled in from the north-west, the unusual strength and direction making them more vulnerable.Little has never seen a storm like it in his 25 years living and working on St Michael’s Mount – a granite outcrop near Penzance topped by a castle and accessible at low tide by a causeway, at other times by amphibious craft. “We’re used to one or two trees falling in storms but nothing like this,” he said as he showed the Guardian around on Wednesday.Its weather station recorded a gust of 111.8mph (180km/h) on the night of 8 January, although the Met Office said the highest in Cornwall was 99mph.Some trees survived, including a twisted sycamore on the east of the island that is a favourite subject for visiting photographers. Elms have also done well. “I think they whip with the wind,” said Little.But a holm oak planted to mark the birth of Prince Harry in 1984 has been uprooted. It is not possible to crane such trees back into place and hope they recover because the soil is too shallow – another reason why the island was so badly hit.View image in fullscreenThe island’s trees are rooted in shallow soil, making them vulnerable to extreme winds.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianA concern is that other trees may have been compromised by the salt water spray that covered the island at the height of the storm and more may fall or have to be felled in the coming months.Little is looking for the positives. The Cornish name for the island – Karrek Loos yn Koos (grey rock in a wood) – suggests the outcrop was once surrounded by forest.However, the climate crisis is leading to stronger storms, wetter winters and drier summers in the UK. “We’ll have to bear that in mind when we rethink and redevelop,” Little said.Back on the mainland, woods and copses important for wildlife have been damaged. A belt of pines near Penzance known as Bog Plantation has been razed. Birdwatchers flocked to this area last Januarywhen a booted eagle, a rare visitor to the UK, dropped in.View image in fullscreenHenry Mathews of St Aubyn Estates said there was a ‘feeling of great sadness’ on St Michael’s Mount.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianFarther inland, trees have come down at Friendship Woods, an important roost for starlings and rooks as well as being a popular dogwalking spot.Henry Mathews, of St Aubyn Estates, which owns Bog Plantation and Friendship Woods as well as managing St Michael’s Mount with the National Trust, estimated it had lost 500 large trees across its 5,000 acres (2,000 hectares) of land. “The loss of trees and habitats is immense,” he said. “There’s a feeling of great sadness.”He pointed out how vistas had changed, with cars heading to Penzance now visible from St Michael’s Mount because so many trees have been lost. “Trees have quietly helped shape the landscape and suddenly it’s changed,” he said.Beloved trees have fallen across west Cornwall, including one on the Isles of Scilly that had a popular rope swing.Ian Marsh, the National Trust’s assistant director for the south-west, said the number of trees lost on its properties could be in the tens of thousands.View image in fullscreenSt Michael’s Mount near Penzance is accessible at low tide by a causeway.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The Guardian“One long-term impact is the loss of specimen trees that people really identify with,” he said. “If you walk your dog and pass a particular tree every day, it becomes part of your landscape and you have memories associated with it. It’s impossible to replace that.”Other spots hit include Penlee Park in Penzance, the setting for an art gallery that is home to paintings by members of the Newlyn School , and the Growing Links community garden near Penzance.Despite the devastation, the people of Cornwall vowed they would replant and restore their landscapes.AtTremenheere Sculpture Gardens, which has views across to St Michael’s Mount, magnificent trees including a woodland walk of mature beeches have been lost.But Polly Bolitho, who works at the gardens, said they were looking forward. “Even in this moment of loss, this garden always evolves,” she added. “It’s in the spaces between light and dark that new ideas begin. From storm to story, we look ahead to the next chapter.”Explore more on these topicsCornwallTrees and forestsClimate crisisExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

Yet he says he is not a masochist. We meet the man Marina Abramovich calls ‘the master’Sinéad GleesonWed 14 Jan 2026 11.37 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Jan 2026 12.14 ESTShareFor one year, beginning on 30 September 1978, Tehching Hsieh lived in an 11ft 6in x 9ft wooden cage. He was not permitted to speak, read or consume any media, but every day a friend visited with food and to remove his waste.The vital context here is that this incarceration was voluntary: Hsieh is a Taiwanese-American artist whose chosen practice is performance art, undertaking durational “actions” for long periods. Marina Abramović has called him the “master” of the form. In 1980, seven months after the end of Cage Piece, Hsieh began another year-long work, Time Clock Piece, which required him to punch a factory-style clock-in machine in his studio, every hour of each day for 365 days.Life can be tough. You have to be your own character. I was very stubborn and had to surviveWhenever I tell people about his work, the response is either admiration or incredulity. Why would anyone want to subject themselves to this kind of discipline and repetition over such a long period of time? “The kind of art I make is about how I understand the world,” says Hsieh. “It’s how I mark the passing of time. That’s all life is, and it’s the one thing that makes us all equal. It doesn’t matter if you’re lazy or hard-working, poor or rich, we’re all just passing time.” Hsieh is sitting in Dia Beacon – the museum for the DiaArtFoundation – in upstate New York, where a major retrospective, Lifeworks: 1978-1999, is three days from opening.View image in fullscreen‘I realised I could use my body to express things’ … sleeping rough for Outdoor Piece.Photograph: Tehching Hsieh, courtesy Dia Art Foundation/© Tehching HsiehBorn in 1950 as one of 15 children in Nanzhou, Taiwan, Hsieh never finished school. During compulsory military service in the early 1970s, he began painting, but became interested in performance work. Jump, his first action, was performed in 1973 and involved him leaping from a second storey window (he broke both his ankles). Taiwan was a conservative society and the US beckoned as the place to continue his practice. In 1974, after taking a cleaning job on an oil tanker, Hsieh jumped ship in Philadelphia and made his way to New York.As an undocumented migrant with no English, he took cleaning jobs and worked in kitchens. He was an outsider on multiple fronts, but doesn’t feel this influenced his drift towards performance art. “Literature and philosophy influenced me – Kafka, Dostoevsky, existentialism … but then I had no passport or social security number in America. So I couldn’t apply for grants and had to use my own money. Even when it was difficult, I still made the work. I used to think I had to go out and find ideas, but I realised that I could use my body to express things, even though I don’t think my work is autobiographical.”View image in fullscreen‘I cannot go inside!’ … objecting to his arrest for vagrancy during Outdoor Piece.Photograph: Claire Fergusson, courtesy Dia Art Foundation/© Tehching HsiehPainting would have been an easier path, but Hsieh became interested in conceptual art and pivoted. He began to plan actions for which he would create a concept, outline the project with a statement of rules, and commit to it. His first five works took place over one year; the year-long framework reflects the idea of the circle, a life lived in one year increments around the sun. The word “durational” has been widely used to describe this kind of long-form art, but Hsieh is slightly resistant to the term. “When people use the word ‘durational’ about what I do, I point out that six minutes is also a duration. I was just interested in the idea that one year is a human calculation we all recognise.”Arguably his most difficult project, One-Year Performance 1981-1982, involved living outside for the whole year. He was not permitted to enter any building, vehicle, or use a tent. On the day a friend happened to be filming, he was arrested for vagrancy and in the footage with NYPD, is shown struggling, shouting: “I cannot go inside!” That winter was the coldest of the century in New York. At Dia, a video of collated clips shows the brutality of it: washing in the Hudson, sleeping in car parks, or carrying his backpack through heavy snow. One gallery wall is lined with printouts of downtown Manhattan, documenting the routes he took, the fluctuating temperatures, the sites of defecation.In person, Hsieh is compact and neatly dressed. He is almost pathologically modest, playing down the hardship and commitment of those one-year projects. He is self-deprecating about the impact and groundbreaking nature of the work and ambivalent about art world praise. “This was the way for me to make art. I enjoyed the freedom – and freedom of thought – it brought. I had no desire to be rich or successful. I don’t feel I needed it. So I was never in competition with anybody.”Occasionally Hsieh takes out his phone to look up something on Google translate. When talking about the difficulty of the performances, he searches for a word that he never wanted to be described as. The screen says: “martyr”.The mainstream New York art world of the time was by and large run by white men. Anyone different, including those making corporeal performance art like Abramović, Carolee Schneemann, and Hsieh – often found themselves outside that. Hsieh learned to rely on himself, to be his own curator, with the cage and street as his gallery. He cites Kafka’s The Castle, in which a man struggles to gain access to a certain world. “Life is not equal for everyone and it can be tough, but you have to be your own character. I was very stubborn and had to survive.”View image in fullscreenCounting the days … in Cage Piece.Photograph: Claire Fergusson, Life Images; courtesy Dia Art Foundation/© Tehching HsiehDespite his outsider status at the beginning of his career, Hsieh doesn’t feel the actions he created were political. The pieces emerged from a personal perspective, he says, even if others detected topical undercurrents. Outdoor Piece explored themes of homelessness, carcerality, navigating a city without transport or the comfort of a home to return to. “People often tell me what they think the work is about, or what they feel are my themes or ideas. It was never about politics – it was always about just passing time.”I ask if Outdoor Piece was his hardest work to undertake and he is typically droll. “It’s like being asked about a favourite child, ‘Which one do I like more?’ The six pieces in the show are like my children so I can’t say that one was harder than the other. But the work is not masochistic, it’s not about pain, even if other people think that it is.” He likens some performance art to the equivalent of lying on one nail, but thinks of his own as more even, like a bed of nails.Hsieh’s work can also be seen as a prophecy of the non-stop nature of life, how it is almost impossible to disappear, or to not be seen or traced by technology. It speaks to the hyper connectivity of modern life and the digital world, and of our constant proximity to others. In 1983, for his fourth one-year project, he was tied by an eight-foot rope to fellow artist Linda Montano.View image in fullscreen‘I was never in competition with anybody’ … Hsieh todayPhotograph: Mollie McKinleyAt the core of early performance art is its impermanence and ephemerality, but Hsieh was fastidious in documenting what he made. There were daily photographs of Cage Pieceand tapes of recorded conversations with Montana as they were tied together. One vitrine at Dia Beacon houses a pile of the time-clock chads and 8,760 photographs of Hsieh – one for each hourly punch – span the walls. In the reconstructed wooden cage, the original toothpaste and brush sit on a sink. Seeing his life’s work in one place is stark and moving.Hsieh concluded his final 13-year performance (Thirteen Year Plan) – of making art and not showing it publicly – in Greenwich Village on New Year’s Eve 1999, the day he turned 49. He released a statement that resembled a ransom collage (and is on display in Dia) that states: “I kept myself alive. I passed the Dec 31, 1999.”He is frequently asked why he stopped his artistic practice, or if he has made any art in the interim. He makes a differentiation. “I never finished or retired, I just don’t do it any more. I only ever wanted to do what I wanted to do … and I did that. I’ve been in New York for over 50 years and I’m very comfortable living here, but I still don’t call it home. I think of it more as a community, but if people enjoy the work I made here, and I die here, I accept that.”Tehching Hsieh: Lifeworks 1978-1999 is at Dia Beacon, New YorkExplore more on these topicsArt and designPerformance artArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereKeza MacDonaldWed 14 Jan 2026 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Jan 2026 10.01 ESTShareStudies on gaming’s effect on the brain usually focus on aggression or the cognitive benefits of playing games. The former topic has fallen out of fashion now, after more than a decade’s worth of scientific research failed to proveany causative linkbetween video games and real-world violence. But studies on the positive effects of games have shown that performing complex tasks with your brain and hands is actually quite good for you, and that games can bebeneficial for your emotional wellbeingand stress management.That’s all well and good, but I’m obsessed with the concept of “gamer brain” – that part of us that is drawn to objectively pointless achievements. Mastering a game or finishing a story are normal sources of motivation, but gamer brain is inexplicable. When you retry the same pointless mini-game over and over because you want to get a better high score? When you walk around the invisible boundaries of a level, clicking the mouse just in case something happens? When you stay with a game longer than you should because you feel compelled to unlock that trophy or achievement? When you refuse to knock the difficulty down a level on a particularly evil boss, because that would be letting the game win? That’s gamer brain.I am not sure whether gamescausethis very particular flavour of obstinacy, or whether people with obstinate tendencies are drawn to video games. But almost everyone I know who plays a lot of video games is susceptible to it. It’s the part of you that simply will not give in, the part of you that’s determined to bend a game’s rules to your will. The extreme version of it is learning to play impossible DragonForce songs from Guitar Hero at 2X speed, just because you can. Or everything that happens atAwesome Games Done Quick(AGDQ), marathons of joyful gaming pointlessness in which people take on increasingly esoteric challenges, such as playing The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Maskblindfolded, or speeding through a cursed, modded version of Halo that’s full of random items from other games.It was this year’s AGDQ, in fact, that got me thinking again about gamer brain, and why we love this stuff. But I also thought about it a lot while playing Baby Steps last year. It’s a game that embraces yet gently mocks the concept of gamer brain – not least through its main character, the useless Nate, who embodies a bunch of stereotypical gamer characteristics, including being totally unwilling to ask for help.View image in fullscreen‘A joke you’re making with the player’ … Baby Steps.Photograph: Devolver DigitalTwo of its creators, Gabe Cuzillo and Bennett Foddy, told me a lot about this when we spoke in November. Baby Steps is full of moments that tease you, the player, into attempting ridiculous feats. At several points you’ll find big holes in the ground that you can purposefully fall into, just to see what happens (spoiler: nothing is ever down there). One character warns you away from a tower, telling you there’s no reason to climb it because there’s nothing at the top; of course, I immediately tried to climb the tower. Once, I spent 10 minutes inching my way up a river to a waterfall to see what was behind it; on the rocks behind the water was nothing but a crudely drawn penis.“There is a normal dirt path by a cliff that you can walk up perfectly safely, and then along the cliff is a series of wooden pegs that you could walk up instead, if you wanted to risk losing 20 minutes of progress,” says Foddy. “That’s a joke that you’re makingwiththe player, because for them to find that funny, they have to know that they’re tempted to walk on the pegs. If the player didn’t feel anything about that other than, ‘Oh, that’s not the correct way to go, I won’t walk on those pegs’, then there’s no joke. But the player gets it because they do want to do the difficult thing.”The most exquisite joke in all of Baby Steps, for me, comes when you find a pair of glasses that make invisible steps visible. If you decide to try to walk all the way across a bunch of rocky pillars to find these glasses, risking a fall at any moment that would waste perhaps an hour of your time, you will see a path of invisible steps that eventually lead to an invisible trophy. Nate will practically weep with joy in front of this trophy that nobody else can see, calling over a fellow hiker to admire it, who of course can only see Nate dancing around triumphantly in front of absolutely nothing.View image in fullscreenDogged … Nathan Drake, right, in Unchartered 4: A Thief’s End.Photograph: Sony Computer Entertainment“The joke that we keep coming back to is when the player puts themselves in a particular psychological or emotional state and then Nate gets to reflect that in some way,” Foddy says. “You’re seeing yourself reflected in this loser. That’s the deep joke: this guy, this couch potato, he’s actually you in this moment.”Cuzillo, who also voices Nate, has a chronic case of gamer brain. “Over time, we came around to this idea that a lot of the level design is an opportunity for introspection about why you’re playing the game at all, what kinds of rewards you’re attuned to and why you play games in general,” he says. “You’re asked as a player: What do you care about? Who are you as a person? If you don’t jump into the hole, you’re [left] wondering for the rest of the game about whether you should have jumped in the hole.”Gamer brain is thought of as a masculine concept, though I can attest that you don’t have to be a man to suffer from it. “I think this is a gendered type of play, toxic masculine play, or at least it’s constructed as such,” Foddy says. “That stuff is riddled through gaming culture. It’s riddled through the kinds of characters that players are asked to embody. Nathan Drake in Uncharted is determined and full of grit, but is that the same thing as being obstinate and dogged and pursuing something stupid?”Baby Steps is one of those games that you can only truly appreciate if you have a bit of gamer brain in you. Trying to explain why it’s funny is close to impossible – you have to have some understanding of the compulsion and strange transcendence of pursuing pointless objectives. But here’s the key thing about gamer brain, and perhaps about games in general: these things aren’t pointless if they actually mean something to you.What to playView image in fullscreenComforting, achievable January play … Sword of the Sea.Photograph: Giant SquidWhen I startedSword of the Sealast night and found myself surfing over dunes of tastefully rendered animated sand, I immediately thought ofJourney. Alotof this game brings Journey to mind, from the art style and animation to the minimal demands that it makes of you as a player. But you know what? It’s been almost 15 years since that landmark PlayStation 3 game, and it’s been lovely to play something that channels its best moments. You swoosh around the desert, occasionally jumping, occasionally pressing square to make something happen, finding places where your magical sword can bring water back to your arid surroundings. After you’ve flooded the former desert, you surf around on the water instead, ocean creatures flitting around you. It is beautiful, mindful and soothing, if admittedly a little insubstantial; I have found it a comforting, achievable January play.Available on:PS5, PCEstimated playtime:2-3 hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenEpic battle … Hollow Knight: Silksong.Photograph: Team CherryThis week Iwrote aboutplayingHollow Knight: Silksongwhile living with a chronic pain condition; this beautiful, punishing game has become emblematic of a time when I was thinking a lot about the nature of suffering.Lego’s take onPokémonhasfinally been revealed, featuring a £579.99 Kanto evolutions set and a rather unfortunate-looking Pikachu.

There’s nothing wrong with blockbuster games, but it’s really lovely to discover brand new – and sometimes incredibly weird – experiences. Aside from the Guardian’s regular indie recs, of course, the front page of digital video game storeItch.iois a good starting point – a lot of smaller developers put their new projects on there and it’s quite well curated.Steamalso runs regular indie promotions, including an annual indie festival, and it’s worth watching the annualIndie Gameawards,IndieCadeandGamesfor Changefor interesting titles. There are lots of review sites specialising in indie titles, too – for example,Indie Game ReviewerandJohn Walker’s Buried Treasure. Elsewhere,Blueskyis great for following indie developers – there are lots of lists and starter packs to join, which will give you instant access to indie communities. You can search Bluesky’s directory for suggestions.

I had been to Europe. I had been to America. I live in Canada. And then you go to Togo; it’s a little different, you know?”Auger-Aliassime, the seventh best tennis player in the world, was describing the homecoming he enjoyed 12 years ago as he first caught a glimpse of Togo, the country his father, Sam, was born in and emigrated from to Canada before his son’s birth. It was a significant moment in his life.“It opened my eyes,” he says. “I had heard stories, but it opened my eyes to the reality of what my dad faced growing up, the conditions. And you’re fighting against the [odds]. If we’re in a race with the rest of the world, you’re starting further behind [in Togo] than, let’s say, we are in Canada. So I thought to myself, if one day we can come back as a family, do something.”Since that first trip as a 13‑year‑old, Auger-Aliassime has returned to Togo numerous times to visit his family, further connecting with his heritage and following the progress of his charity efforts. He most recently returned in December 2024. For Auger‑Aliassime, the most eye‑opening part of his homecoming was the kindness and contentment he saw throughout his time in Togo, even from those living under extremely challenging circumstances.View image in fullscreenFélix Auger-Aliassime in action against Jannik Sinner at the ATP Finals in Turin in November.Photograph: Alessandro Di Marco/EPA“You imagine how it is, but it’s not quite the reality. I saw that [their difficulties] didn’t change that the people had good spirits. They had smiles on their faces, and they were positive people, and everybody’s kind to each other,” Auger-Aliassime says. “At the same time, I saw the conditions. How many kids were in one class, up to 50 [children] in one class. The material not being the same at all. The infrastructure, obviously, is adapted to the conditions there, but nowhere near the level of what we have in Canada or countries in Europe. That was eye opening.”He soon transformed those thoughts of “doing something” into decisive action. Since 2020, Auger‑Aliassime has partnered with the humanitarian aid organisation Care to support thousands of people in Togo. His fundraising efforts have included #FAAPointsForChange initiative, which sees him donate $5 (£3.70) for each point he wins on the tour to benefit children in Togo, with his partner BNP Paribas tripling the amount. Those funds have been invested in a variety of initiatives, from providing school supplies and sports equipment to aiding the development of young adults, directly affecting more than 2,700 people. “It has grown,” he says.“We’re transitioning now to helping the best in the classes to get scholarships, to go to universities. Often what happens is they drop out. Even if they’re brilliant, they’d drop out of school because they just need money and school is too expensive. So [we] get scholarships for higher studies, and … I believe it’s going to pay off.”Auger-Aliassime’s most recent journey to Togo preceded one of the most significant runs of his career. Towards the end of 2024, he was struggling with his game. He had fallen to No 29 in the ATP rankings, his results were inconsistent and confidence was low: “It was not like I was losing all the time. But for sure there were months where I was thinking: ‘OK, what’s my approach tactically with my game?’ Once I got the physical things kind of sorted out, it was like: ‘OK, now I’m healthy again. How am I playing?’ […] The challenge is to make that as consistent as possible,” he says.1:46Will anyone end the Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz supremacy? – videoOn and off the court, Auger‑Aliassime is known for his professionalism, humility and diligence. His quiet hard work began to pay off in the second half of 2025. He thrived in the US hard-court swing, reaching his second career grand slam semi‑final at the US Open. He ended his season by winning his eighth career title in Brussels and reaching the semi-finals of the ATP Finals, a searing run that earned him a spot inside the world’s top five.Along with the untouchable performances from Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, the dearth of true challengers at the top of the sport has been compounded by serious injuries to some of the other most talented young players on the tour, including the 24-year-old Jack Draper, the 22-year-old Holger Rune and the 21-year-old Arthur Fils. Auger-Aliassime therefore returns to Melbourne for theAustralian Openin a position that seemed unlikely a year ago: between his quality and good form, he is one of the few players harbouring realistic hopes of making life difficult for the two favourites.At 25 years old, Auger-Aliassime is also already approaching veteran status in the game. It has been 11 years since, aged 14, he became the youngest male player in history to win an ATP Challenger match. Hype inevitably followed in 2015, with the Canadian being tipped to instantly win grand slam tournaments and lead the new generation. Many believe he has underachieved considering his significant shotmaking and athletic potential.However, his father’s journey from Togo to Canada positions his achievements in a different light: “[Thinking of] the stories from him growing up, it’s just the freedom they had. It was just kind of being isolated from the rest of the world, but at the same time, he’s there, and they feel like their town is the centre of the world. The stories he tells me are always positive,” Auger‑Aliassime said.“He met my [Canadian] mum, and they had a great time [in Togo]. And then moving to Canada, it was different for him. It was difficult, because all of a sudden, you have to come and work. You don’t want this to be a failure. You don’t want to move to Canada and […] you just end up, I don’t know, bouncing from jobs, not achieving something.”From those simple beginnings, it was Sam Aliassime who first coached his son. Auger-Aliassime now travels and works with his father around the world, competing in the biggest tournaments as one of the best players each week. In this context, his achievements and career have long been remarkable.View image in fullscreenAn 18-year-old Félix Auger-Aliassime shakes Rafael Nadal’s hand at the Madrid Open in 2019.Photograph: Rubén Albarrán/ShutterstockExplore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Australian OpenTennisAustralia sportinterviewsShareReuse this content"

You found that out last week with Venezuela,” he added.The Danish foreign minster said earlier on Wednesday that Trump remains intent on “conquering” Greenland as the talks with US officials failed to solve a “fundamental disagreement” that has led to unprecedented tensions between Washington and a Nato ally.It was “absolutely not necessary” for the US to seize Greenland, a largely self-governing part of the Danish kingdom, the Danish foreign minster, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, said late on Wednesday.“We didn’t manage to change the American position. It’s clear that the president has this wish of conquering Greenland. And we made it very, very clear that this is not in the interest of the kingdom.”Rasmussen urged Washington to engage in “respectful” cooperation over the Arctic island that is controlled by Copenhagen.In a signal of European support, France, Germany and Norway have all said they would contribute troops to a multinational force led by Denmark that would lead to “an increased military presence in and around Greenland, comprising aircraft, vessels and soldiers, including from Nato allies”, the Danish defence ministry has said in a statement.The two sides did agree to create a working group to discuss ways to work through differences as Trump continues to call for a US takeover of the semi-autonomous territory of Nato ally Denmark.“The group, in our view, should focus on how to address the American security concerns, while at the same time respecting the red lines of the Kingdom of Denmark,” Rasmussen told reporters after joining Greenland’s foreign minister, Vivian Motzfeldt, for the talks.The closely watched talks on Trump’s demands to take over Greenland ended in Washington after nearly an hour.The vice-president, JD Vance, and secretary of state,Marco Rubio, hosted the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland on Wednesday in what observers worried could be an ambush meant to pressure the Danes into ceding the territory under US economic and military pressure.Earlier, Trump said it would be “unacceptable” for Greenland to be “in the hands” of any country other than the US, reiterating his demand to take over the island hours before the high-stakes talks on its future.“The US needs Greenland for the purpose of national security. Nato should be leading the way for us to get it,” the US president saidon social media. The alliance would become “far more formidable and effective” with the territory under US control, he claimed.“It is vital for the Golden Dome that we are building,” he said, referring to a proposed missile defence system.View image in fullscreenTrump disembarking from Air Force One on Tuesday. He has said the US ‘needs Greenland’.Photograph: Luis M Alvarez/APExpert reports suggested it could cost the US as much as $700bn (£520bn) to take over the territory, according to US media, and European officials have played down the likelihood of a direct American attack to take control of the island.As the two sides met, the Danish defence minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, said the country would establish a “more permanent” and larger military presence in Greenland and that it was “highly hypothetical” the US would launch an attack to take the territory.During the talks, the White House continued its social media offensive against its Nato ally, depicting two dogsleds headed toward either the US or Russia and China, with the caption: “Which way, Greenland man?” Trump had previously said Denmark’s defence of the territory was composed of “two dogsleds”.Trump first raised the idea of a takeover of Greenland in 2019, during his first term, but has ramped up his rhetoric significantly since returning to the White House last year, saying the USwould take it “one way or the other”.He has jolted the EU andNatoby refusing to rule out military force to seize the strategically important, mineral-rich island, which is covered by many of the protections offered by the two organisations because Denmark belongs to both.Rasmussen and Motzfeldt initially sought the talks with Rubio but the meeting took place at the White House after Vance asked to attend and then to host the talks.Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly pointed out that a 1951 bilateral agreement already allowed the US to vastly expand its military presence on the island.Several EU leaders have backed Denmark,pledging theirsupport for its territorial integrity and right to self-determination. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said on Wednesday that the island “belongs to its people”.“For me, it’s important that the Greenlanders know and they know this by the deeds, not only by the words, that we respect the wishes of the Greenlanders and their interests and that they can count on us,” she said in Brussels.France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said that if “the sovereignty of an EU country and ally were to be affected, the knock-on effects would be unprecedented”. France would “act in full solidarity with Denmark and its sovereignty”, he said.Greenland’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen,told a joint press conferencewith his Danish counterpart, Mette Frederiksen, on Tuesday that the island would not be owned or governed by Washington.“If we have to choose between the US and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark, Nato and the EU,” Nielsen said, adding that Greenland’s “goal and desire is peaceful dialogue, with a focus on cooperation”.Frederiksen said it had not been easy for Denmark to “stand up to completely unacceptable pressure from our closest ally” but the fact was that “borders cannot be changed by force, and that small countries should not fear large countries”.A Reuters/Ipsos poll on Wednesday found just 17% of Americans approved of Trump’s efforts to take over Greenland and that substantial majorities of both Democrats and Republicans opposed using military force to annex the island.Only 4%, including just one in 10 Republicans and almost no Democrats, said military force would be a “good idea”.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandUS foreign policyDenmarkJD VanceMarco RubioDonald TrumpEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

She praised him for pushing forward with the bill after months of arguments over its future.But on Wednesday Aspinall, along with other people whose relatives died at Hillsborough and in the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, emerged from a meeting with Starmer saying they were disappointed with the government’s position.Thebill will enforce a duty of candour on public officialsand contractors to tell the truth in their work and to positively assist inquiries and investigations after disasters. But families have raised concerns since the bill was published about the specific protections it offered to serving intelligence officers.The families do not want directors of the intelligence services to be able to veto officers giving evidence because of the experience at the inquiry into the Manchester Arena bombing.Individual officers gave evidence at that inquiry, showing that MI5 had not been truthful about intelligence it had that might have led to the bomber being stopped before the attack in which 22 people were killed at an Ariana Grande concert.Caroline Curry, whose son, Liam, 19, died in the Manchester Arena bombing, said: “As it’s proposed at the moment, the government’s bill is still giving carte blanche to the security services, MI5, and we just can’t back it with that.“Good on the government for actually taking the law and running with it and putting it into parliament because the Conservatives didn’t. But do it the right way. Don’t blow it at the last hurdle. We’re just really disappointed. It’s just so infuriating.”Curry said the “false narrative” MI5 put forward was “torture” for her after her son was killed.A government source said it was “deeply regrettable” that no agreement had been reached with families but that it had gone as far as it could without compromising national security.Ian Byrne, a Labour MP who has submitted an amendment for the law to apply to individual intelligence service officers, said as it stood he could not support the bill. He told the Guardian it would be the “saddest moment of my political life” if he could not back the legislation.One Cabinet Office source said Starmer had said the situation arising from the Manchester Arena inquiry could not happen under the government’s proposals because intelligence services would have a duty of candour not to mislead. But sources admitted that the intelligence services would have discretion over whether to allow individual officers to give evidence at all.The families say individual officers should provide their evidence to any inquiry with a duty of candour, and if the intelligence service heads argue it should be excluded on national security grounds they should make an application for that to be determined by the inquiry chair.Pete Weatherby KC, who represented bereaved families at the 2014-16 Hillsborough inquests and at the Manchester Arena inquiry, and is a director of the Hillsborough Law Now campaign, said Starmer had listened in the meeting but the families could not accept the government’s position. He said that the families’ proposals acknowledge national security concerns, which could be legitimate grounds for excluding evidence, but the aim of the law was to prevent cover ups.“There’s a real roadblock here. The government have not delivered in respect of the application of the bill to the security services: as things stand today, the lies and cover-ups that were features of the Manchester Arena inquiry could happen again. The government is in danger of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory on a landmark piece of legislation, because they are putting protecting the security services ahead of truth and justice.”More than 20 Labour MPs, including Byrne and Anneliese Midgley, had backed amendments to the bill to place a duty of candour on intelligence officers. The bill was meant to return to the Commons on Wednesday but will now be delayed until next week.Starmer’s spokesperson said earlier on Wednesday that the government still hoped to find a way to gain the families’ support. “We’re fully committed to working with the families to make the Hillsborough law strong. It is a personal priority for the prime minister and the government wants to get this right.“That’s why last Friday, we tabled a series of amendments to strengthen provisions in the bill. That’s why we delayed it until next week to see if we can go further. As I say, we will never compromise on national security.”A government source said they hoped they could continue dialogue with the families but that the bill would progress next week with the government’s concessions so far laid as amendments.“This bill will make our intelligence services the most scrutinised in the world,” they said. “There will have to be some circumstances where the consent can be withheld, but they can be held to account for use of those conditions. We want to make it as strong as we can.“There might be a case where officials know only part of the operation they are on, they might not know they are putting parts of the operation at risk by giving evidence. That might prevent them stopping another attack or preventing serious crime. But these amendments will be a huge step forward strengthening the bill from where it is at the moment.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerHillsborough disasternewsShareReuse this content"

On Wednesday, Heba Muraisi, 31, would have been on day 73 of refusing food, the same number of days as reached by the Irish republican hunger striker Kieran Doherty, who survived the longest of 10 men who died in a 1981 action. The earliest death among the Irish republicans was after 46 days, raising fears about the risk to life of the prisoners in jail awaiting trial for offences relating to protests claimed by Palestine Action.Among their demands had been to shut down Elbit Systems, a slogan used by Palestine Action in its campaign against the company’s UK sites.Late on Wednesday, Prisoners for Palestine said the decision not to grant Elbit Systems UK the contract, under which it would have trained 60,000 British troops a year, fulfilled a key demand. It said the company had won more than 10 public contracts since 2012, and so the decision by the Ministry of Defence marked a shift in thinking among officials.Prisoners for Palestine also pointed to a meeting that took place on Friday between national leaders of prison healthcare and representatives of the hunger striking prisoners, at the behest of the Ministry of Justice, which it said involved discussion of prison conditions and treatment recommendations.Kamran Ahmed, 28, who would have been on day 66 on Wednesday, and Lewie Chiaramello, 22, who has type 1 diabetes and has been fasting every other day and would have been on day 46, have also stopped refusing food.Teuta Hoxha, Jon Cink, Qesser Zuhrah, and Amu Gib, who had paused their strikes, are also ending their action.Prisoners for Palestine said they have now all begun refeeding in accordance with health guidelines, which is itself a dangerous process that risks death if not done properly.The Guardian understands that Umar Khalid, 22, who resumed his hunger strike on Saturday after previously pausing it, is continuing to refuse food.Prisoners for Palestine said there had been a number of victories: “In the past few weeks alone, 500 people have signed up to take direct action against the genocidal military-industrial complex, more than the amount of people who took action with Palestine Action over its five-year campaign. During that five-year campaign, four Israeli weapons factories were shut down. Elbit Systems is living on stolen time – we will see it shut down for good, not because of the government, but because of the people.”It also said that Muraisi’s transfer back to HMP Bronzefield in Surrey had been accepted by HMP New Hall in Wakefield, to which she was moved last year, hundreds of miles from her family and friends. Her transfer had been another demand of the hunger strikers.Prisoners for Palestine said Hoxha had been offered a meeting with the head of the joint extremism unit at her prison, which it said “orchestrates the prisoners’ treatment as ‘terrorists’”.Another demand had been an end to the censorship of prisoners’ communications. The group said: “During the hunger strike, some of the prisoners started receiving bulk packages of withheld mail, and in one case received an apology from prison staff for a letter that was delayed by six months. Books on the topics of Gaza and feminism have also been given after months of waiting.“Our prisoners’ hunger strike will be remembered as a landmark moment of pure defiance, an embarrassment for the British state. It exposed to the world Britain has political prisoners in service of a foreign genocidal regime, and has seen hundreds of people commit to take direct action in the prisoners’ footsteps.”Gib said: “We have never trusted the government with our lives, and we will not start now. We will be the ones to decide how we give our lives to justice and liberation.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

It received another in 2022, making it the first site inWalesto win two stars. Prices start at £468 per person.The restaurant scored one out of five from a visit byFoodStandards Agency officers on 5 November, meaning “major improvement” is necessary.Chef patron Gareth Ward told the BBC on Wednesday he was “not embarrassed” by the rating, which he said was due to inspectors’ concerns about the use of raw and aged ingredients.“I’m buying sashimi-grade fish from Japan and they’re questioning, ‘Well, we don’t know the water, so how do we know it’s sashimi grade?’“Well, it is sashimi grade, this stuff’s eaten raw all over the world and just because our rules don’t fit their rules, they’re questioning it … I’ve got a salt chamber for ageing fish but they obviously don’t like the idea of ageing stuff.“I’m not at all ashamed but I am disappointed. I’m not sat here thinking, ‘Oh my God, I’m embarrassed, I’ve done something wrong’, because we haven’t. What we have done is something different.”Ward, a former contestant on MasterChef: The Professionals, said Ynyshir employs a specialist compliance company to address food safety and has a £50,000 freezer capable of reaching temperatures of -80C (-112F).After the inspection, the restaurant’s fish was sent away for independent laboratory testing, which found no concerns.Ward acknowledged that the food safety officers were “not 100% wrong”, and has since installed an additional hand-washing station in the fish preparation area. He also said paperwork problems contributed to the poor score.“Some of our paperwork wasn’t right, and that’s our fault,” he said. “Sometimes you miss stuff or sometimes you write stuff down wrong or forget … I’d need a full-time office worker doing the paperwork to get it perfect every time.”In Wales and Northern Ireland, all food establishments are legally required to display their hygiene rating in a prominent place.In a statement, a spokesperson for Ynyshir said the business had requested a reinspection but no date had been set.Explore more on these topicsWalesFoodMichelin GuidenewsShareReuse this content"

A quarter of a century on from its Channel 4 debut, why has it fallen so far off the radar?Daniel Dylan WrayWed 14 Jan 2026 06.13 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Jan 2026 11.50 ESTShareThere are few British comedy shows that were as popular, yet now completely extinct, as Phoenix Nights. The sitcom – which ran for just two series between 2001-2002 – is set in a fictional working men’s club in Bolton, and was a huge hit of the physical media era. Its second series was once the fastest ever selling UK TV show on DVD, shifting 160,000 copies in its first week of release. However, it is now 25 years since it was first broadcast on Channel 4, and it does not feature, nor has it ever, on any streaming service. Instead, it’s confined to dodgy fan uploads on YouTube and the secondhand DVD market. It is also almost entirely absent from all of the major publications’ best TV of the 21st century listicles.Nevertheless, it remains a programme like few others. Distinctly northern and working class, it crucially uses neither as the butt of its jokes. In the same way that The Royle Family turned the everyday routine of watching TV, bickering, having a brew and asking each other what they had for tea into a relatably funny yet poignant shared living-room experience, Phoenix Nights invites people through its sparkling tinsel curtains into the familiar yet fading glory of clubland.View image in fullscreenThe cast of Phoenix Nights.Photograph: Channel 4The show is a spin-off from an episode of ThatPeter KayThing, the 1999 spoof documentary series, and was written by Kay, Dave Spikey and Neil Fitzmaurice. Kay plays the lead, Brian Potter, a choleric, acerbic yet bitingly funny club owner who, when not busy being a ceaseless cheapskate, can be found rolling around the club in his wheelchair topping up his whisky glass – which is a flower vase, so that he can reach the optics on the top shelf.Loaded with eccentric characters, wonderful details and sharp-eyed observations, it is material plucked straight from smoke-filled bingo halls and dilapidated function rooms. A world of curled sandwiches at daytime wakes, as people rest pints on coffin lids and fruit machines bleep away, clashing with blaring TVs, the clack of pool balls and the idle chat of regulars. Over 12 episodes, the club encounters a drunk horse during a themed wild west night, guest spots from Catchphrase’s Roy Walker and Bullseye’s Jim Bowen. There’s even a kid’s playground concocted around a portable toilet and scaffolding in the car park, complete with a poorly disguised adult-themed bouncy castle.View image in fullscreenNeil Fitzmaurice as Ray Von and Peter Kay as Brian Potter.Photograph: Channel 4While the show has become synonymous with its most famous star – Kay also plays one half of the bumbling bouncer duo, Max and Paddy, with Paddy McGuinness – it really is an ensemble comedy that succeeds due to the eclectic figures that fill the club. There’s Ray Von (Fitzmaurice), an enthusiastic DJ, dodgy electrician and rumoured murderer; Jerry St Clair (Spikey), the long-suffering club compere who finds himself singing about bin bags in Asda; compulsive liar Kenny Senior (Archie Kelly); the hapless clairvoyant Clinton Baptiste (Alex Lowe); Holy Mary (Janice Connolly), the club’s strict catholic barmaid; and the obnoxious cigar-chomping Den Perry (Ted Robbins), who is Potter’s arch-nemesis and rival club owner. Phoenix Nights is a contained and intimate sitcom, but it’s bursting at the seams with unique characters that make up the club’s hodgepodge community.View image in fullscreenPaddy McGuinness as Paddy in Phoenix Nights.Photograph: Channel 4One character, Keith Lard – an overly officious fire safety officer who is rumoured to be engaged in bestiality with dogs – landed the show in trouble. Keith Laird, a real-life fire safety officer in Bolton, complained and was paid compensation, forcing Channel 4 to issue an apology despite Kay insisting the character was fictional.Understandably, for a show that is a quarter of a century old and based around a working men’s club – a culture which peaked decades earlier – there’s some material that wouldn’t fly today. The second series notably dips in quality and the poor choice to write in a couple of problematic Chinese immigrant characters led to deserved criticisms, even from a member of its own cast. The alternative comedian Daniel Kitson, who played barman Spencer, called the show “lazy and racist”.View image in fullscreenKay as Potter …Photograph: Channel 4Such views have unquestionably affected the reputation and legacy of the show, with Kay recently saying he wouldn’t want it on streaming sites like Netflix as it would likely need a content warning these days. However, in retrospect, the show is much softer, and dafter, at its heart than the widerTV comedylandscape of the 2000s. In an era where Black face was still happening, sexism was rife, and many shows were rooted in nasty humiliation and cruel demonisation, Phoenix Nights, for the most part, offered a comforting antidote.Flawed, sure, but it remains something of an anomaly in British TV. It carved out a singular space in a corner of the comedy world – in terms of region, class and content – that is frequently shunned by mainstream broadcasters. Twenty-five years on, with depressingly low numbers of working-class people working in, and on, TV, a comedy show that felt like a one-off at the time, continues to be. So maybe it’s time to swing by your local charity shop to see if you can find the DVD of this increasingly forgotten gem.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionPeter KayTV comedyComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Those passengers who leap up as soon as the seatbelt sign goes off – if not just before – in order to race down the aisle and be first off the plane. It’s the latest passenger trend infuriating people online.The first people off the plane should be the people in the front row.Not if this lot has anything to say about it.Well, that’s just rude.Not only is it rude, but according to a couple of flight attendants interviewed ina recent Reader’s Digest article, it tends to slow down the process of disembarking for everyone. And don’t get me started on “gate lice”.Excuse me?The people who hang around the gate pre-flight, trying to board the plane before their group is called.I’ve never understood them. Why get on a plane before you have to?The better to seize precious overhead locker space rightfully belonging to others.Actually, when you put it that way, it sounds like a good idea.Recently, people have also begun to speak of “baggage claim lice”.Passengers who crowd around the luggage carousel, blocking the way for people whose bags have already emerged?You got it.If you ask me, this is all just part of the wider problem of everyone being awful.Maybe, but airlines have probably made things worse in their quest for profit – charging extra for front seats, carry-on bags and priority boarding. It creates a competitive mindset and encourages sharp elbows.Can anything be done?Some steps have been taken. The Turkish civil aviation authority recently instituted a £50 fine for airline passengers who stand or remove their seatbelts before the plane has taxied and come to a complete stop.What about the ones who try to jump the boarding queue?In 2024 American Airlines introduced technology to gates at more than 100 US airports that sounds two loud tones if you try to board before your group has been called.Bleeps of admonition?That’s the idea.I suppose anything that makes air travel more enjoyable is a plus, including the public shaming of others.Yes, it helps to pass the time.Do say:“When aeroplane etiquette becomes a matter of passenger safety, the rules must be rigorously enforced.”Don’t say:“Mind if I squeeze past? I can’t bear you people any longer.”Explore more on these topicsSocial etiquettePass notesFlightsAir transportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We beat the crap out of each other’Read moreThe case hinges on the interpretation of various agreements made between the band’s formation in the late 1970s and 2016, in particular how the phrases “mechanical income” and “public performance fees” apply to streaming, which continues to generate significant income for the group.Sting’s representative, Robert Howe KC, argued that an agreement where a songwriter would give 15% of publishing income to the other two musicians as arranger’s fees does not apply to streaming, a position which is contested by Copeland and Summers.The barrister said that since the legal action began in late 2024, Sting has paid more than £595,000 in “certain admitted historic underpayments”.Sting is disputing the wider legal claim, arguing that the arranger’s fees should only apply to physical products such as vinyl and cassettes.It is a distinction that is vital in an era when the group’s biggest hit, Every Breath You Take has been streamed more than 3bn times on Spotify.Howe said the court should pay most attention to a “professionally drafted” agreement in 2016, which he said states that the money is owed only on mechanical income “from the manufacture of records”.The Police formed in 1977 and achieved a US No 1 single with Every Breath You Take, which appears on the band’s fifth and final album, Synchronicity. It was the bestselling US single of 1983, the fifth bestselling of the decade and was sampled on Puff Daddy and Faith Evans’ 1997 song I’ll Be Missing You.The band also had chart success with Roxanne, Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic, Can’t Stand Losing You and Don’t Stand So Close to Me before splitting in 1984.In 2022, Stingsold his entire songwriting catalogue to Universalfor an estimated £221m.Ian Mill KC, for Copeland and Summers, as well as their companies Megalo Music, Kent Foundation Laboratories and Kinetic Kollections, said the agreements dated back to 1977. He said the 15% figure was agreed between the band then, which was later formalised in written contracts.In written submissions, the barrister said the issue for the upcoming trial is “whether the parties have accounted to each other for arranger’s fees correctly in accordance with the terms of the 2016 settlement agreement”.In previous court documents filed in December 2024, Mill said Sting’s former bandmates are owed more than $2m because arranger’s fees had not been paid from money generated through streaming.He said Copeland and Summers understood the 2016 agreement meant they were entitled to a share of money “from all publishing income derived from all manner of commercial exploitation”.The hearing is due to conclude on Thursday, with the trial expected at a later date.On 16 February a verdict is expected in a similar case involving the estates of the Jimi Hendrix Experience bassist, Noel Redding, and its drummer, Mitch Mitchell.The case revolves around performers’ rights, copyright and unpaid royalties from streaming revenues, for recordings including the band’s classic albums Are You Experienced, Axis: Bold as Love and Electric Ladyland.Explore more on these topicsUK newsStingMusic streamingnewsShareReuse this content"

This was part of my attempt to preserve the whole damn thing. The area became a juvenile prison’Interview byDaniel Dylan WrayWed 14 Jan 2026 09.59 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Jan 2026 12.16 ESTShareIlanded in America in 1965 from Chile. I literally arrived on a banana boat. I went to the University of Notre Dame in the midwest and then to Columbia inNew York. I had a teacher – also a photographer – who taught foreign students to write and speak better English. I would try to write poetry, which he thought was terrible. I’d never taken a picture before but he encouraged me to try photography and offered to lend me the money for a Pentax Spotmatic he’d seen for sale downtown. After that, I would just walk around New York with it and take photos. It quickly became clear to me how divided the city was. Half was white and the other half was Black and Latino. There was tremendous segregation.Columbia was very prosperous. The students were well off and many were the sons of extremely rich people. I felt out of place. Also, there’s just a huge sense of loss when you leave your country and you don’t know anybody and are on your own. It made me want to look at what else was going on: to see the other side and the underside of the city. I found it easily because, in the late 60s and early 70s, deindustrialisation was going on. Big companies and car plants were shutting down and there were huge job losses and store closures. That contrast resonated with me. My family had lost a lot of money. The first part of my life was about seeing things disappear and having to make do with less and less. I was interested to see that in the US.People needed money for a fix. Sometimes they'd come at you – but they were in such bad shape I could escapeWalking around New York at the time could be dangerous. There was a lot of desperation, but the risks were part of the excitement. It made you look more carefully around you because anything could happen. There were people high on heroin on the street and looking for money to get a fix. Sometimes they would come at you but even though they were maybe younger and stronger than I was, they were in such bad shape that it was like the whole thing was going on in slow-motion. Even if they came at me with a two by four, I could escape.One day in 1970, I was walking around the Bronx and came across these kids and their dogs. I like the contrast: the impersonality of the setting but a very strong sense of personality in each person and how they were dressed, their pride in that. I always look at the urban landscape – I never think of people as being separated from where I find them. And that’s what this picture has: the group standing before the looming towers of the housing projects on this huge vacant lot – which later became a juvenile prison. Then there’s a subway line in the back. It was a very exciting shot.Huge parts of the city were being destroyed. This was my attempt to answer the question: “How do I preserve this whole damn thing?” There was a lot of good work from that period focusing on very specific things in New York, like the graffiti-painted subways, people playing in the streets, and so on. But my idea was to capture its whole urban reality. That’s what I tried to do, as big and as large as I could, from the skyline to the little details. Because these places were disappearing and it didn’t look as if they were going to come back. And they didn’t.Camilo José Vergara’s New York 1970s series is published byCafé Royal Books.View image in fullscreenCamilo José Vergara’s CVBorn:Santiago, Chile, 1944.High point:“Being honoured with a National Humanities Medal by President Barack Obama in 2012 and being named a MacArthur Fellow in 2002.”Top tip:“Be empathic and inquisitive.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Fashion is a dance between rules and rebellion. Great style requires a bit of both. The rules are essential, because one of the key emotional benefits that a great wardrobe can deliver is a sense of control in a chaotic world. The rules are there to simplify and clarify, lighting our route to a well put-together outfit. That well put-together outfit has the power to help you feel calmer, simply because you look in the mirror and see a competent person and therefore feel like a competent person. Style rules also come in useful for making sense of the world around us. Dress codes, style tribes, the signals we send – whether as blatant as the slogan on a T-shirt, or as subtle as the brand of your rucksack – hold an important social function, making other people legible to us.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But style also needs friction. Fashion dies if it stops moving, because moving with the times is what makes it fashion rather than just pretty clothes. The restless forward energy that moves hemlines and invents new silhouettes is what drives the plot and keeps us interested.So the sweet spot in fashion is where rules and rebellion meet. Your outfit is telling a story, and a story needs both a comprehensible plotline and a dose of dramatic tension. Great dressers know this instinctively. The pop of red lipstick against a simple dark dress, the vintage jeans worn with a smart blazer and heels. A little artistic licence is what elevates a look from being perfectly nice to being red hot. Like the Boss said, you can’t start a fire without a spark.Anything – a crazy jacket, a bright pair of trousers, a kitsch handbag – can be the grit in the oyster that produces a pearlSo allow me to introduce fashion’s most useful new catchphrase: If It Doesn’t Go With Anything, It Goes With Everything. This is a rule – but at the same time it is a kick against the rules. It does both at once, sort of like a two-in-one shampoo and conditioner. If It Doesn’t Go With Anything, It Goes With Everything is chaos theory, but make it fashion – an anti-match system which gives you an ingenious new way of solving your wardrobe puzzles, because it hands you a new tool to unlock the what-shall-I-wear question.View image in fullscreenAn elegantly mismatched Julia Sarr-Jamois, model and fashion director at British Vogue.Photograph: Dave Benett/Jed Cullen/Getty ImagesYou know that piece in your wardrobe that you love, but rarely wear, because it never feels as if it goes with anything? That is your new best friend. This is an expansion of last year’s Wrong Shoe Theory, which held that an unexpected shoe – trainers with a tuxedo suit, biker boots with a tulle skirt, kitten heels with a slouchy track pant – was the key to making an outfit compelling. Extrapolating from Wrong Shoe Theory, we can now see that anything – a crazy jacket, a bright pair of trousers, a kitsch handbag – can be the grit in the oyster that produces a pearl.The genius of this theory is that it brings your wardrobe orphans in from the cold. You know the ones I mean. The cardigan from a posh shop in an overexuberant colour, which you bought because it was 50% off in the sale. Almost anything you bought on holiday. The mistake we often make is to try to make those pieces work by partnering them with something plain. But a rainbow crochet jacket with sober trousers and a white T-shirt makes no sense – so wear it over a zebra-striped shift dress instead. Instead of thinking of outfit building as a logic puzzle requiring pieces that slot neatly into shape, indulge in some free association. Instead of looking for the piece that will match the rest of your outfit, look for the one that will energise it.If you need proof that this rule works, consider how certain forms of it have become style staples already. Leopard print, for instance: once we started treating this as a neutral and wearing it with Breton stripes or neon pink, it found a permanent place in our wardrobes. Or take, for example, the wearing of a band or slogan T-shirt – could be the Ramones, could be J’Adore Dior – under a blazer. This is visually illogical, because you can’t read the T-shirt properly. But it looks great. Go figure. The rules are there to be broken. And sometimes two wrongs do make a right.Model: Orla at Milk. Styling assistant: Charlotte Gornall.

The new season will take place five years after the characters were last seen.The trailer shows Zendaya’s Rue involved in trouble with drug dealers, including a returning Martha Kelly, Sweeney’s Cassie becoming a cam girl while married to Elordi’s Nate, and Schafer’s Jules becoming a sugar baby.The official logline reads: “A group of childhood friends wrestle with the virtue of faith, the possibility of redemption, and the problem of evil.”Other returning cast members include Alexa Demie, Chloe Cherry, Maude Apatow and two-time Oscar nominee Colman Domingo.“We’re gonna have a devastatingly gorgeous, epic season that I think is breaking the mold of television,” Colman toldDeadline. “I think it’s gonna become more cinema than television.”Newcomers this season include Sharon Stone, Rosalía, Natasha Lyonne, Danielle Deadwyler and Marshawn Lynch. This season will also see Oscar winner Hans Zimmer join as composer.The show’s creator, Sam Levinson, has called it “our best season yet”.“The one thing we all agreed on is we can’t go back to high school – although many, many shows have had 30-year-old high school students, we’re not,” he said. “Five years felt like a natural place [to jump] because if they had gone to college they’d be out of college at that time.”It follows Levinson’s second show for HBO, music drama The Idol, which received largely negative reviews. The Guardian’s Rebecca Nicholsoncalledit “a big, dumb spectacle”.Sweeney, who is now leading the hit domestic thriller The Housemaid, has called the season “crazier” than what’s come before. Zendaya, who led the hit tennis drama Challengers in 2024, will next be seen alongside Robert Pattinson in The Drama and Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey.

A system that sends paramilitaries on to the streets will observe no limitsWed 14 Jan 2026 12.46 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Jan 2026 14.52 ESTShareAfew years ago, towards the end of the second Obama administration, a friend and her wife flew back to New York from a holiday in Mexico, landing for a connecting flight in South Carolina. At immigration, the officer looked from one to the other, asked their relation to one another and on receiving the reply, made a noise of disgust – “ugh”. On the pretext that American citizens can’t go through the same lane as a spouse on a green card (not true), he sent them to the back of the line, causing them to miss their connection. But that’s not the point of the story.My friend is a white Australian who is generally conflict-averse; her wife is a Japanese-American who can stop traffic with a single, hard stare, and who teaches in the South Bronx, where many of her students have been harassed by law enforcement since the day they were born. As trouble got under way, my friend kicked off like a good’un, swearing and muttering sarcastically in the Australian style, while her wife shot her desperate, angry looks. Shut up. Shut Up. SHUT UP.I have been thinking about this incident a lot since the death last week of Renee Good, the Minnesota womanfatally shotby an ICE agent. The use of deadly force was justified on grounds of self-defence, according to the US administration. That explanation doesn’t appear to be borne out by the videos, but the thing I also keep thinking about is the way in which, immediately prior to the shots being fired, Good and her wife, Becca, addressed the agent. “You wanna come at us?” says Becca, in the agent’s general direction. “I say go get yourself some lunch, big boy.” When the officer approaches Good’s open car window, she smiles, addresses him as “dude” and says mockingly: “I’m not mad at you.”It goes without saying that in a healthy democracy, mouthing off at authority shouldn’t constitute putting oneself in mortal danger; sarcasm is my stress response, too. But this assumes that civic norms apply. This is the US, where even in normal times use of deadly force by cops isn’t an infrequent occurrence – a conservative estimate by the University of Illinois puts theaverage numberof people killed annually by US law enforcement at 600. We may not yet have all the facts surrounding what motivated the ICE agent to use deadly force, but on the evidence of the videos alone, it seems to me apparent that both Good and her wife made a single, terrible,understandable miscalculation: they underestimated the danger they were in.Some commentary on the right has suggested that the jocular tone adopted by the women is an indication of their political glibness; that they were somehow “playing” at protest. I don’t think this is true. It did, however, suggest a sheltered understanding of the country they’re living in, and one that isn’t unique to their side. The invasion of the US Capitol on January 6 by crowds, some dressed for a costume party, resulted inthe death of Ashli Babbitt, the Maga martyr who was shot and killed by police. Participating in a violent mob invading the seat of government isn’t the same thing as driving away from law enforcement. But in both cases, apparently deeply felt political convictions were expressed with a levity – a larky tone of protest – premised on assumptions of safety.It’s a devastating misapprehension. A few years after my friend’s trouble in South Carolina, I was pulled out of the passport line at JFK airport and made to sit in a side room for questioning. My indignation was total. I swore, I carried on. As my two toddlers screamed, I felt the phrase “I’m a British citizen!” bubble up through my system like a character from a Paul Scott novel. After three hours with no toilet or phone access, I was released to go home, whereupon I relayed the story to my partner at the time as if returning from war, a conquering hero.She looked at me coldly. “You’re a fucking idiot,” she said, when I told her how rude I’d been. “What if they’d asked you where the girls’ father is? And why aren’t you travelling with their birth certificates?” I couldn’t believe that I was getting grief off this person who has never met a cab driver she couldn’t start a fight with – but then, her antecedents were murdered by Nazis. She understands a real threat when she sees it. Nothing should take away from Good’s courage or convictions. But there are lessons to be learned: a system that puts paramilitaries on US streets to round people up willy-nilly should be approached by those protesting with the understanding that there is nothing – nothing – it won’t do to shut them up.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is not enough that they remove harm when they find it – the law must make their systems prevent harmWed 14 Jan 2026 11.48 ESTShareOn X, a woman posts a photo in a sari, and within minutes, various users are underneath the post tagging Grok to strip her down to a bikini. It is a shocking violation of privacy, but now afamiliar and commonplace practice. Between June 2025 and January 2026, I documented 565 instances of users requesting Grok to create nonconsensual intimate imagery. Of these, 389 were requested in just one day.Last Friday, after a backlash against the platform’s ability to create such nonconsensual sexual images, X announced that Grok’s AI image generation feature wouldonly be available to subscribers.Reports suggest that the botnow no longer respondsto prompts to generate images of women in bikinis (although apparently will still do so for requests about men).But as the technology secretary, Liz Kendall, rightly states, this action “does not go anywhere near far enough”. Kendall has announced that creating nonconsensual intimate images willbecome a criminal offencethis week, and that she will criminalise the supply of nudification apps. This is appropriate, given X’s weak response. Placing the feature behind a paywall means that the platform can more directly profit off the online dehumanisation and sexual harassment of women and minors. And stopping the “bikini” responses after public censure and the threat of legislation is the least X can do – the bigger question is why it was even possible in the first place.These measures are a step forward. The shadow technology secretary, Julia Lopez, suggested in her response that the government was overreacting, that this was just “a modern-day iteration of an old problem”, no different from crude drawings or Photoshop. She’s wrong. The scale is different. The accessibility is different. The speed is different. With Photoshop, there is a technical skill required, as well as direct publication by a user, which places all actions except platform provision squarely on them. In this case, though, the user makes a regular text reply with a request, and Grok generates and publishes criminal abuse to a massive audience.Grok is undressing women and children. Don’t expect the US to take action | Moira DoneganRead moreKendall’s approach criminalises users who create or alter these images, and the companies that supply dedicated nudification tools. That’s where it misses the point. Grok and most prominent image-generation tools are not dedicated nudification tools. They are general-purpose AI with weak safeguards. Kendall is not asking platforms to implement proactive detection. The law waits for harm to happen, then punishes.The drawbacks of this approach are obvious. I observed this material being generated for months before the mainstream backlash began. These are harmful images that were generated that still exist, and perhaps were saved and shared across other platforms. For the victims of this AI sexual abuse material, regulation after the fact won’t help. For harm that is structurally amplified in this manner, the approach must be preventive, not reactionary.Another more fundamental problem is that while the UK pushes AI safety regulation, the US is moving in the opposite direction. TheTrump administrationwants to “enhance the United States’ global AI dominance through a minimally burdensome national policy framework for AI”. Under this framework, there is little incentive for American AI companies to regulate misuse of their products. This matters because AI regulation is incomplete without cross-border collaboration. Kendall can criminalise users in the UK, she can threaten to ban X entirely. But she cannot stop Grok from being programmed in San Francisco. She cannot force OpenAI or Anthropic or any other US company to prioritise safety over speed. Without US cooperation, we are trying to regulate a transnational technology with national laws.While this wrangling over regulation and updating policy plays out, many victims, and other women online, will be wondering what this new era of AI-enabled online sexual harassment means for them, and questioning their participation on global social media platforms. If my image has been digitally altered, how do I get justice if the perpetrator is halfway across the world? Transparency in the practices of AI companies isin decline– so how could the same companies be trusted to be accountable and audit systems that reproduce harm?The truth is that these companies cannot be trusted. This is why globally, regulation needs to shift from “remove harm when you find it” to “prove that your system prevents harm”. We must code power into the process by requiring mandatory input filtering, independent audits and licensing conditions that make prevention a legal technical requirement. This means it may catch the harm before it materialises, enabling regulation to minimise harmful behaviour by these AI companies before their products are deployed. This is the type of work that we at theAI Accountability Labin theAdapt Centreat Trinity College Dublin are pushing forward through our research.Regulation after the fact is better than nothing. However, it offers little to the victims who have already been harmed, and sidesteps the conspicuous absence of law enforcement in addressing these platform harms.Nana Nwachukwu is an AI governance expert and a PhD researcher at Trinity College DublinExplore more on these topicsGrok AIOpinionAI (artificial intelligence)XLabourLiz KendallInternetComputingcommentShareReuse this content"

What caused the change in attitude?Wed 14 Jan 2026 12.52 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Jan 2026 12.54 ESTShareAPE teacher from Cardiff called Tony is frozen solid after being caught in an avalanche in 1979. There he remains until global heating sees to his thawing and he pops up in the present day, exactly as he was back then. Comedy ensues. This is make-believe, by the way; it’s the premise ofMike Bubbins’ BBC series Mammoth. In the masterful opening scenes, to the sound of Gerry Rafferty’s Get It Right Next Time, we see Tony being scornful, angry, frightened and disgusted by four things that didn’t happen before his big freeze.He scoffs at a bloke carrying a baby in a sling, gives a charity chugger very short shrift, and jumps out of his skin when a youth on a hoverboard zips past him. But it was Tony’s disgust at a woman picking up her German shepherd’s poo that got me thinking. When did picking up dog poo become the thing to do? Or, put another way, when did just leaving it there become the thingnotto do? When did we start becoming disgusted at those who didn’t pick it up rather than those who did? This is a pretty seismic cultural shift, I’m sure you’ll agree.I’ve been quizzing dog owners of a certain age about this. No one can quite remember when or how the change came about. What they all agree on is that, in the past, yes, dogs crapped everywhere with impunity. Also, because of the bonemeal used to bulk up dog food, it was white, which must have made it next to impossible to dodge in the snow. My auntie Barbara, who has owned countless dogs over her long life, points out that it was less a case of owners not picking up the poo; it was more that the owners often weren’t with their pets anyway, as dogs were generally left to roam at will. Only rarely did you see them out for walks on leads. I suppose you could argue that these were halcyon days for dogs as well as their owners. Easy life, if all ownership entailed was giving them a roof over their heads at night, some bonemeal-rich Lord-knows-what to eat, and sending them out to go about their daily business as they saw fit. Off you go, have a good one, see you tonight. For dog-sitters, the 50s and 60s must have been lean times indeed.Apparently my uncle Mike’s dog Tinker used to pop round to say hello most days, Auntie Barbara’s house being a regular call on his daily wanderings around Handsworth. Sweet. And, in its own way, rather civilised – apart, obviously, from Tinker’s turds, which must have soiled many a shoe in his time. Did it not enrage people when this happened? Apparently not – it was just part of life. Could it be that the dogshit rage only properly kicked in when picking up the revolting stuff became an option?For this, it seems we have to thank the former mayor of New York, Ed Koch, who we must assume trod in something one too many times for his liking, and resolved to take action. The consensus is that his landmark 1978 “Pooper-Scooper Law” was the gamechanger. Facing down opposition from those who professed concern about dog abandonment and, I suspect, those who just couldn’t face picking it up, he got it through. If you’re interested, there’s a whole book about this:New York’s Poop Scoop Law; Dogs, the Dirt, and Due Process. I’ve not read it, but it’s on my list.Koch is quoted as saying, “If you’ve ever stepped in dog doo, you know how important it is to enforce the canine waste law. New Yorkers overwhelmingly do their duty and self-enforce. Those who don’t are not fit to call friend.” I approve this message.

The worry a few months ago was that bill payers would be forced to pay more than £100 a megawatt hour (MWh) via contracts that give developers guaranteed prices for their electricity output. In the event,winning projects landed at roughly £91/MWh.Cue some forgivable crowing from Ed Miliband, the energy secretary. “A monumental step towards clean power by 2030,” he declared. Officials pointed to calculations by the energy consultants Aurora and Baringa that £94/MWh would have been a “cost-neutral” outcome for consumers even though today’s wholesale price, usually set by gas generation, is about £81/MWh (the analysts’ reasoning is that using less gas lowers the wholesale price, offsetting the cost of the subsidies for new windfarms).But let’s not get carried away. Yes, this auction was Europe’s “biggest ever” in commissioning 8.4GW of capacity in one go – and it again proved the virtue of competitive tension in the bidding process. But it also demonstrated two hard truths about offshore wind and the wider push towards clean power.Will Great Britain’s offshore wind subsidy auction mean lower energy bills?Read moreFirst, the days when offshore wind got cheaper every year are over. The last auction at the end of 2024 bagged capacity at £82/MWh but those contracts were for 15 years. Miliband’s switch to 20-year contracts this time probably knocked £5/MWh off headline numbers, so a like-for-like comparison might score this year’s outcome at closer to £96/MWh. That equates to inflation of 17%. We are a very long way from the hopeful days of 2022 when offshore wind was still tumbling in price. Higher borrowing rates and tighter supply chains have changed the arithmetic.The rollout of offshore wind at these prices will not knock squillions off the price of electricityThe second point flows from the first: the rollout of offshore wind at these prices will not knock squillions off the price of electricity. Any downward pressure on bills cannot be enormous when we’re talking about the difference between £91 and a theoretically neutral price of £94. Yes, more renewables offer protection against spikes in the price of gas. But, remember, Wednesday’s inflation-linked prices are being locked in for 20 years in a system that already produces some of the highest electricity prices in the developed world.Onshore wind and solar, where auction results are due in fortnight, should come in cheaper. But offshore, with its greater generating capacities, is the renewables workhorse. The consensus among energy analysts is that “whole system” savings from a renewables- and nuclear-heavy system will only start to appear sometime about 2040.None of which should be read as an argument against offshore wind. Something has to be built because several nuclear power stations will soon close, and a third of the gas power plant fleet is nearing the end of its life. As Milibandpointed out, new gas plants aren’t cheap either, given bottlenecks in the supply of turbines – call it £147MW/h for building and operating one, says the energy department.Instead, this auction has really demonstrated that we are deep in the world of trade-offs in energy transition. There are no more easy 2022-style pickings. Is it, for example, vital to hit Miliband’s target for clean power, defined as 95% generation from low-carbon sources, by 2030? Of course not. The deadline was always artificial.As it is, the government is probably on course for 85%-90% after Wednesday’s auction. Why bother with the last bit if, as seems to be the case, the law of diminishing returns is setting in? Electricity also needs to be cheaper (or, at least, not even more expensive) to encourage the take-up of electric vehicles, heat pumps and so on.With this record wind power auction, we’ve proved the rightwing doubters wrong | Ed MilibandRead moreInstead, the most pressing questions in energy-land are different. Is it possible to take a chunk out of the towering £80bn bill for rewiring the electricity grid? If 90% low-carbon is deemed enough, possibly,as retail energy suppliers have argued. Will new transmission cables arrive before the new windfarms are built? That is critical to keep a lid on “constraint” payments that run on to billions of pounds.And what is the government’s plan for gas? It barely talks about the backup system for cold, windless winter days that will be retained. That is despite the scariest report out of the energy department in recent months being the one that warned ofan “emerging risk” of running out of gas supplies by 2030if an important piece of kit, such as a pipeline from Norway or an LNG terminal, were out of action.Encouragingly, there are hints of greater pragmatism. Chris Stark, the head of “mission control” unit in the energy department, said the 2030 target for offshore wind is “on track” but it is “not essential” to hit it given the strong result in the latest auction; there is scope to be “choosy” on projects in future. Good.For the next step, Miliband could say out loud what everybody already knows: the 2030 generation deadline can be ditched because 90% clean power is fine and bigger energy challenges lie elsewhere.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryWind powerRenewable energyEnergycommentShareReuse this content"

Expect a run for office very soonWed 14 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Jan 2026 09.31 ESTShareLast week Kai Trump, Donald Trump Jr’s daughter and the president’s eldest grandchild, publicly declared she had no plans to run for office. The 18-year-old appeared onLogan Paul’s Impaulsivepodcast, where she stated that “politics is such a dangerous thing … I think if both sides met in the middle, everyone would be so much more happier.” (Maybe tell that to your grandpa, kid.) “To be honest with you,” she said, “I stay out of politics completely … I don’t want anything to do with politics.”Is Trump building a political dynasty? – episode oneRead moreLook, I know you’re still very young, Kai, so here’s a little advice from an old lady: maybe work just a teeny bit harder at keeping a safe distance from politics. It has not gone unobserved that the influencer and golfer has made alotofcontentabout life behind the scenes at the White House. She’s also launched an apparel collection, which she’s modelled on theWhite House lawn. And, notably, she spoke at the 2024 Republican national convention (RNC), where she insisted Trump was “just a normal grandpa”. I don’t know about that; my grandad didn’t invade Venezuela.Kai, by the way, stressed to Logan Paul that she was the one who decided to speak at the RNC; it was “literally all my idea”. But the nasty media, she noted, spun it otherwise. “[They said] ‘Oh well, that’s like a political plan that was put in place, to like get more voters or anything like that’.” Well, yes, because it was a political convention. They tend to be, you know, political.Still, even though Kai is counting herself out, there’s a good chance we may see another President Trump in our lifetimes. After all, he has five kids and 11 grandchildren. Surely at least one will follow in Donny’s footsteps?The question is: who has the best chance of continuing the political dynasty? At one point I’d have said it was Ivanka. But while I haven’t written off the idea of a political comeback for her, she’s currently sworn off politics and is hanging out in Florida doing billionaire things, while her husband,Jared Kushner, makes plans to redevelop a “cleansed” Gaza.The rest of the Trumps are, sadly, certified losers or too young to opine upon.

As a thriller writer myself, I recognise the traits that make her such a formidable FaithfulWed 14 Jan 2026 06.06 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Jan 2026 11.50 ESTShareThis time last year a rumour swept through the close-knit British crime-writing community, not whispered in a quiet moment in the billiard room but shared on group chats and message boards. The producers ofThe Traitorswere recruiting contestants for 2026, and wanted one of us to take part. Ofcoursethey did! The Traitors is a controlled, lower-stakes, stylised version of the golden age country house whodunnit, which is itself a controlled, lower-stakes, stylised version of real-life murder. It is crime writers’ job to examine the dark side of human behaviour. Betrayal of trust and manipulation are all in a day’s work. We often write from multiple perspectives, identifying with victim, perp and detective, giving us a unique kind of empathy. We spent the rest of the year wondering who it would be. (I didn’t get the call.)Last November, in that howling no man’s land between the finale of Celebrity Traitors and the transmission of series four, I went along with 13 fellow crime novelists to the Traitors Live Experience in Covent Garden. Despite being professional pattern-finders with highly tuned powers of observation, none of us at the replica round table guessed that the Chosen One was among us, and had already completed her stint on the real thing.Harriet Tyce, the barrister turned thriller writer, is perfect for the show, says former detective and bestselling novelist Clare Mackintosh. “The cat-and-mouse game in crime and thriller novels isn’t only between detective and villain, it’s between author and reader – who will reach the truth first? Whether Traitor or Faithful, a crime writer makes a formidable opponent.”To make plot twists work, we have to create characters who are good at pretending to be good guysMark EdwardsMark Edwards, Traitors superfan and author of The Wasp Trap, agrees. “When talking to my family about The Traitors I referred to the players as ‘characters’, a slip that proves I watch it in the same way I read crime fiction. Writing crime novels makes us very good at games. That’s why Harriet was able to see that Hugo was a Traitor immediately.”Ah yes, the takedown that launched a thousand memes. Harriet’s uncloaking of Traitor Hugo in episode three was masterly. It’s one thing to have your suspicions, another to present them convincingly. Her speech was the stuff of the courtroom dramas she writes; eloquent, controlled, incisive. “It has occurred to me from the moment that I found out that you were a barrister that you would be a prime target for the Traitors to take out,” she said, as the nation watched with barely controlled lust. “You have experience at cross-examination, you’re good at presenting your case and you’re highly articulate.” She closed with: “Those are hard facts, as far as I’m concerned.” In Ardross Castle, hard facts are thinner on the ground than protective Shields, but by presenting theory as data, Harriet made sure itbecamefact. Misdirection is all about delivering near-truths with such panache that the reader doesn’t question it. In a show in which so many banishments are vibes-based (“I’m voting for yourself because you took the last croissant at breakfast”), a novelist’s persuasive skills are powerful.View image in fullscreen‘Prime target’ … Hugo, on left, in The Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan CherryHarriet is, in Traitors parlance, “playing a blinder”. (We will overlook her misstep with Ross, the most doomed Faithful ever. All good sleuths have a fatal flaw.) I’m not sure writing mysteriesautomaticallyqualifies one to excel at the game. We spend most of our time alone, typing and wearing fleeces covered in pet hair. Yes, I practice to deceive, but it takes me months to get those plot twists down on paper. In conversation, I fumble my words and, like Stephen the Traitor, I’m a blusher. That said, authors do develop soft skills that might equip them well for life in the castle. In my time at literary festivals and libraries, I’ve learned how to engage a room of strangers quickly. “To be a successful author you have to be comfortable talking to people and making them like you,” says Edwards. “The players who are good at networking, like Jessie, are far less likely to be banished.”That’s our suitability for the Faithfuls established, but what of the dark side? “To make twists work,” says Edwards, “we have to be able to create characters who are good at lying and pretending to be good guys. These baddies are always the most fun characters to write, and I think we would all relish the chance to be one of them, if only for a few weeks.”When we played the Traitors Live, Harriet began as a Faithful but was recruited as a Traitor halfway through the game. If she crosses the floor in the show, the day job will give her further advantage. Crime writers love playing with dramatic irony. We are puppet masters, never happier than when the readers know something the characters don’t. What is that if not the essence of Traitorhood? That, and the inability to resist a chance to make mischief.The Night Stairs by Erin Kelly is published by Vintage in July. To support the Guardian, pre-order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

But the days when only two parties were licensed to supply Britain with prime ministers are goneWed 14 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Jan 2026 07.49 ESTShareUnpopular politicians take consolation in the thought that opinion polls are sometimes wrong and often describe the wrong thing. They capture the moment but don’t predict the future. A midterm poll measures how much voters like the government. A general election asks whether the opposition is trusted to take over. It isn’t the same question.Labour’s hopes for recovery rest on that distinction. The plan is that economic growth and governing competence will boost general wellbeing in the coming years. That will dial up the risks associated with other parties, especially forReform UK. Voters who lack enthusiasm for the prime minister may be persuaded to stick with him if the alternative is Nigel Farage.A similar calculation sustains theConservatives, although in their version, the economy falters. The Tories then hope to surge with a campaign arguing that Labour has overtaxed Britain and misspent the proceeds, and that Reform UK, lacking fiscal or any other discipline, would make matters worse.These are optimistic but not wildly improbable scenarios. They also have a common bias in the assumption that politics will follow precedent; that beneath the surface volatility flow strong and familiar currents; that the normal way of things is not lost for ever.ForLabour, that assumes continuity of a trend for the ruling parties to regain support when a general election comes around. For the Tories, it is the idea that Britain always turns to them as the accountants of last resort, once Labour has run out of money.Both are attached to the convention that only two parties are licensed to supply Britain with prime ministers and, whatever polls might show today, Reform UK is not one of them.Farage recognises that as a cultural barrier to his ambition. It is why he takes such pleasure in parading Conservative converts to his cause. Their function is to cast Reform UK as the new natural party of power on the right. The downside risk is diluting any claim to rupture from the old establishment.The latest recruit, Nadhim Zahawi, illustrates the dilemma. On one hand, having a former Tory chancellor on board is supposed to signal the seriousness of intent to govern. On the other hand, Zahawi is an opportunist who resigned over tax irregularities and is on record callingFarage a menace to Britain. The Reform leader is betting that he gains more in political momentum from headline-grabbing defections than he loses in brand contamination when the calibre of the defector comes under scrutiny. Sharing stages with every kind of opportunist chancer has never slowed Farage’s progress before.Meanwhile, Kemi Badenoch’s boosters claim her recent focus on the economy is working. The Toriesare polling marginally highernow than a few months ago, but are still shy of the 24%share they managedin July 2024, when they were crushed in a general election. It could be worse. Keir Starmeris struggling to keepLabour’s share out of the high teens and above the Greens.Strategists in all parties like to complain about Westminster’s unhealthy obsession with polling (while obsessing unhealthily over polls). It is true that surveys don’t tell us anything certain about a general election that isn’t due before 2029. The future is never fixed. Also, Britain’s first-past-the-post electoral system ishopelessly ill-equippedto translate multiparty politics into a rational distribution of parliamentary seats. Once four or five candidates are clustered around the same projected vote share, almost anything could happen.Two-party politics assumes stable bases of support on the left and on the right, with swing voters migrating across the centre ground. In today’s fragmented and polarised climate, that trade is thinner than traffic within multiparty blocs: a liberal-progressive one and a conservative-nationalist one. Neither is very stable, but they are efficiently delineated by attitudes to Farage. Either you recoil from the thought of him holding the levers of national power, or you don’t.Labour and Tory leaders assume a historic claim to primacy within their respective coalitions, but that sense of entitlement doesn’t reflect the balance of real-world opinion. Viewed through the lens of local council races so far this parliament, England’s two-party systemlooks more like a competitionbetween Reform and the Liberal Democrats.Perhaps it is premature to call the decline of Labour-Tory duopoly terminal. Farage might have peaked. He might be consumed by scandal. Starmer and Kemi Badenoch might be replaced by leaders who give their respective parties new leases of life.But the possibility that a more permanent, seismic change is under way might also be underpriced by Labour and Tory leaders who have a lot invested in old patterns reasserting themselves. The scale of it is hard to process, psychologically and psephologically. It requires acceptance that their current unpopularity is not just a consequence of dissatisfaction with choices made by the present government and its immediate predecessor, but an expression of doubt that politics in the familiar configuration can deliver anything other than disappointment.The historic Labour -Tory rivalry is also a kind of mutual dependency. They define themselves as ideological antitheses and so they find it hard to admit shared ownership, in many voters’ minds, of a long historical incumbency. They are joint guardians of the Westminster system that has stopped working for a lot of people since around the time of the 2007-08 financial crisis. That was when average incomes stopped rising in real terms, when conveyors of opportunity stalled and the postwar promise that each generation could have what their parents had and more was broken.It is unfair to apportion blame equally to both parties when every prime minister from 2010 to 2024 was a Tory. Labour didn’t preside over austerity and Brexit. But it was Starmer’s job, as the first Labour leader to win an election since 2005, to convince people that he had a theory of what had gone wrong in the meantime, and a plan to fix it. Hisfailure to communicatesuch things is one point on which opinion polls are unambiguous.Could he turn Labour’s fortunes around? Could Badenoch capitalise on his weakness to put the Tories back in contention? Normal political patterns indicate either is possible. But the pattern of recent politics also suggests that the old normal is exactly what voters do not want.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionLabourKeir StarmerConservativesReform UKGeneral electionscommentShareReuse this content"

But when possession of the latter is a legal requirement, the distinction has clear political significance. So does the government’s decision this week toabandon proposalsto make digital ID mandatory.People will still have to verify their identities in order to work in Britain. That was declared as the main purpose of the scheme when Sir Keir Starmerannounced itlast autumn. It would prevent people without the proper entitlement – illegal migrants, in short – having jobs. Now the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, says she is “pretty relaxed” about what kind of ID is used for verification.Cracking down on undocumented labour is not the only advertised benefit of digital ID. It is sold as a way for all citizens to enjoy streamlined access to public services, but that doesn’t require compulsion. A genuinely useful tool would be taken up voluntarily. Dropping the mandatory element improves the policy, keeping its potential utility while addressing a key concern about civil liberties. The volte-face would be less embarrassing for the prime minister if it did not conform to a pattern of equivocations and U-turns.This is not even the first such course correction of 2026. Last week the governmentdiluted tax changesthat threatened pubs with higher business rates. Last year saw multiple policy revisions and reversals. Often, as in the case of withdrawnwinter fuel paymentsto pensioners and changes toinheritance tax thresholdsfor farmers, Downing Street has stuck with an unpopular policy long enough to suffer sustained political damage, only to then yield to critics. This method maximises the cost of ill-planned policy and compounds it with lost authority. That was especially true in the case of proposed benefit cuts, abandoned last summer after a bruising and futileclash of willswith Labour MPs.The combination of combative stances and capitulations has many debilitating effects. It makes the prime minister look weak. It is a disincentive to loyalty, because ministers who dare to defend unpopular positions in public soon enough discover they were wasting their time. Above all, it signals an absence of strategic direction for a prime minister who came to office pledging to fulfil various “missions” but has not yet communicated a coherent sense of purpose.The government is without ambition or achievement. Commitments torenewable energy, planning reform, infrastructure investment, enhanced rights for workers and renters could all be woven into a narrative of national renewal and collective security. But articulation of a grand vision is not in Sir Keir’s natural skill set.He now declares that thecost of livingwill be the object of his “relentless focus” this year. It is a sensible priority. Ensuring voters do not feel worse off in the coming months is a necessary condition for the prime minister’s political survival, but not a sufficient one. Domestic economic performance is not something any government can entirely control, especially in times of immense global volatility. The likelihood of unexpected crises makes it all the more important that the prime minister looks resolute and competent. The pattern of U-turns doesn’t help. It is hard to maintain confidence in the judgment of a leader whose constant vacillations imply an inherent lack of conviction.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But passengers and commuters will believe it when they see itWed 14 Jan 2026 13.22 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Jan 2026 14.52 ESTShareIn areas starved of the kind of investment taken for granted in the south-east, the miserable state of northern England’s railways has long been a source of anger and indignation. One analysis of Treasury figuresfoundthat the equivalent of seven Elizabeth lines could have been built in the north, if levels of funding devoted to London’s transport needs had been replicated there. Instead, an estimated £140bn shortfall means that the 35-mile trip from Liverpool to Manchester can take more than twice as long as the 42-mile journey from London to Reading.Plans to resuscitate the Northern Powerhouse Rail project (NPR),unveiledon Tuesday by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, are therefore welcome and overdue. The government has committed to developing a three-stage plan to upgrade rail connections from the west coast to the north-east. No doubt mindful of the political threat posed to Labour by Reform in “red wall” seats, Sir Keir Starmer hailed the moment as a turning point, observing that northerners had “been let down by broken promises” in the past.That is something of an understatement. Since George Osborne firstmooteda high-speed rail connection across the Pennines in 2014, the NPR train has barely left the station. HS2 ignominiously ground to ahaltat Birmingham instead of continuing to Manchester and Leeds. HS3, conceived as a means of unlocking economic potential in the north by bringing cities and towns closer together, proved to be an unfunded pipe dream. As politicians have repeatedly talked of creating a brave new world, outdated and unreliable rolling stock has continued to take its time traversing crumbling Victorian infrastructure.Will it be any different this time? After protracted negotiations, Labour’s northern mayors have rallied behind the government’s proposals, which include a new station for Bradford – the country’sworst-connectedbig city. But a discernibleundercurrentof cynicism is understandable.The headline figure of £45bn to reverse the years of underinvestment is substantial. But only £1.1bn of government money has initially been allocated to develop the modernisation project, and much of the major work will only take place in the 2030s and 40s. Construction on a new Birmingham-to-Manchester line – vital to ease congestion on the west coast mainline route – is only expected to begin 20 years from now. A dearth of detail over delivery raises fears that, once again, the north will be taken for a ride, as future administrations shift priorities and local authorities are left to pick up the pieces.That cannot not be allowed to happen. The economic case for improving the transport infrastructure of the north is inarguable. Futureproductivity gainsresulting from easier mobility could eventually dwarf the cost of upgrading. Just as importantly, in a country where deepening regionalinequalitieshave fuelled understandable resentment, giving northern England a respectable rail network can help unify a divided and increasingly polarised nation.During the 1980s, British Raillaunchedan upbeat advertising campaign based on the slogan “We are getting there”. Given the length of its timelines, the government could scarcely be said to be fast-tracking its NPR relaunch. Nevertheless, the direction of travel is the right one. This time, though, the journey needs to be completed rather than aborted en route. Long-suffering passengers and commuters will not be holding their breath.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Until this process is complete, I am legally prohibited from seeing patients.It is therefore deeply troubling to learn from your article that multiple companies have been awardedNHSADHD contracts despite not having CQC registration. In addition, some health professions fall outside the CQC remit and thus can set up a practice “diagnosing and treating” ADHD tomorrow – for example, a psychologist working with a prescribing pharmacist.I have also previously worked for a large private provider that expanded rapidly to deliver NHS ADHD contracts. While many clinicians were conscientious, the model was contract-driven and narrowly focused rather than patient need- or clinician-led. Clinicians were put under pressure to prioritise throughput, continuity of care was fragile, and patients only discovered that their clinician could be replaced overnight after it had happened – an experience many found deeply upsetting.These problems are the predictable result of an overstretched public system outsourcing into a fragmented and unevenly regulated market, while placing the greatest regulatory burden on small, expert psychiatrist-led services. High-quality ADHD assessment requires time, expertise and continuity. Regulation should enable this – not obstruct it.Dr Vicky CleakSouthamptonThe NHS has as much incentive as private providers to overdiagnose ADHD. This is largely due to the appeal, for patients and clinicians, of a quick fix using amphetamines for the condition. I know this because my daughter was prescribed them by an NHS clinician when her self-diagnosis was supported after a one-hour assessment and questionnaire.When the amphetamines didn’t work, he increased the dose. When the symptoms got worse, he prescribed antidepressants, seemingly determined to find the answer in a pill. Her request for therapy was dismissed, as he felt she needed to feel better with a drug intervention before she could benefit. Her symptoms abated after a significant change to her circumstances, which at the time we all neglected to pay enough attention to. I can only be grateful that the drug interventions didn’t cause long-term damage or dependency, as I suspect they have in others who have been let down by the focus on diagnostic and drug-based interventions for complex disorders.Name and address suppliedAside from the wild west of ADHD provision, parents should be aware of what they are walking into when seeking diagnostic referrals for their children. The effectiveness of behavioural interventions is dependent on consistent application within the family; it is arguably easier to be compliant with medication than to engage in sustained behavioural change. The onlymedications recommended by the NHS National Institute for Health and Care Excellenceare psychostimulants or amphetamines – in lay parlance, “speed”.As discovered by the generations freely issued with tranquillisers, the long-term health costs of a seemingly miraculous fix are great. The need for non-pharmacological treatment for ADHD that restores neuroplasticity at minimal risk has never been greater.Mona SoodSouthend-on-SeaHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

But leaping from that to banning the practice altogether is not justified.Given that it is a longstanding and important tradition among Jews, Muslims and various other cultures, the best way forward is to only permit circumcision if it is practised by someone specifically qualified for it and who belongs to a nationally accredited scheme. This would involve compulsory training, monitoring all cases and producing annual reports.Such a step is vital if we value both the safety of children and the integrity of faith backgrounds, and should be implemented as soon as possible. It is time to clamp down on rogue practitioners who have been tolerated for far too long.Rabbi Dr Jonathan RomainConvener, Rabbinic Court of Great BritainYour article quotes Jonathan Arkush, a former president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews and co-chair of Milah UK, as saying that “I have never met any Jewish man who thinks they’ve been harmed by circumcision.”I am a Jewish man who thinks he has been harmed by circumcision, and there are plenty of others. The US-based organisation Bruchim emphasises that Jewish men are Jews whether circumcised or not, and counts among its members many who oppose circumcision as a form of harm.I have long been puzzled by the argument that circumcision shouldn’t be treated as abuse just because it is a tradition. Male circumcision plainly involves nonconsensual mutilation of an infant’s body, and the fact that it is tradition no more justifies that mutilation than it does in the female case.Name and address suppliedI was circumcised as a young baby. I learned later in life that it was a medical necessity at the time, but despite that, I have felt disfigured and uncomfortable about it most of my life (I am now in my 89th year). So I would fully endorse the guidance in the Crown Prosecution Service document.It never ceases to amaze me that two of the biggest religions in the world, both of which believe God made man in his own image, proceed to “improve” God’s work by deforming a child for “religious reasons”. I believe the practice arose for entirely different reasons but was somehow justified on religious grounds.Ray FittonNewlyn, CornwallExplore more on these topicsCircumcisionReligionHealthHealth & wellbeinglettersShareReuse this content"

Certainly Donald Trump, who has told us that his own personal morality and very big brain take precedence over international law, could do with a copy, as could Vladimir Putin and Benjamin Netanyahu, as the latter pair continue to dodge international arrest warrants.Perhaps she might also send a copy to our attorney general, Richard Hermer, who appears to have codified the doublespeak emanating from Keir Starmer in the wake of Trump’s very clear breach of the charter and international law in his smash-and-grab shakedown in Venezuela? Lord Hermer has invented a nostrum that Geoffrey Robertson KC would blow away in a micro-second; a new “UK right” to weigh diplomacy before “calling out” allies on international law breaches (Report, 9 January). Perhaps Lord Hermer takes us all for imbeciles.It is 80 years this month since the first UN general assembly gathered in the Methodist Central Hall in London.

The scene may have provided an amusing image of the various styles of bra, but was not worthy of a programme that has previously shone much light on the everyday lives of women in postwar Britain.As a recent Guardian long read made clear (‘Pretty birds and silly moos’: the women behind the Sex Discrimination Act, 18 December), second-wave feminists confronted everyday sexism on a scale almost unimaginable to women today. A reminder: the four demands of the movement were equal pay; equal education and job opportunities; free contraception and abortion on demand; and 24-hour childcare.Bra-burning was a false trope picked up readily by tabloids of the time – papers for whom women were either “housewives” or “dolly birds”.

And when it was over, thisCarabao Cupsemi-final felt firmly within their grip. But for a late goal from the Chelsea substitute Alejandro Garnacho, his second of an eventful cameo, it would surely have been over.Even so, it was difficult on this evidence to predict anything other thanArsenalprogressing into the final; moving closer to a rare piece of silverware under Mikel Arteta – one to pave the way for others this season?‘I’m accountable’: Rosenior deflects blame from Sánchez after Chelsea’s lossRead moreArsenal brought the physical fight. There were times when they seemed to bullyChelsea, when they made Liam Rosenior fret on his first home game as the Chelsea manager. They scored the opener from a reassuringly familiar source, Ben White converting from a Declan Rice corner – Arsenal’s 24th goal from a set piece this season.Robert Sánchez offered minimal resistance in the Chelsea goal; he was all at sea under the delivery and he would be at fault for Arsenal’s second, which was turned in by Viktor Gyökeres early in the second half. Sánchez’s handling error on a low cross from White was grotesque, of a piece with an erratic individual performance.Chelsea battled, especially Garnacho, even if his first goal was the prompt for Arsenal to score again. It was Martín Zubimendi who provided the moment of the night, a flash of silk amid the steel, his ice-cold finish after Gyökeres’s layoff leading Arteta to rub his eyes in astonishment.At that point, it felt as though Arsenal would score again to turn the second leg in early February into nothing more than a contractual obligation. Credit to Chelsea for staying alive, to Garnacho for another confident conversion. Rosenior could praise the spirit of his players. Was it real hope? The smart money said it was simply an illusion.View image in fullscreenAlejandro Garnacho scores Chelsea’s second goal to give them hope.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersIt was comfortably the biggest game of Rosenior’s managerial career, albeit this is a line that will be repeated quite a bit in the coming weeks and the first thing to say is he could have been luckier with his player availability. The headline absentees were the injured Reece James and Cole Palmer and the suspended Moisés Caicedo. Liam Delap was a late cry-off because of illness.Arteta’s idea was to leave nothing to chance. He has been stung bytoo many semi-final defeats. He has managed to get through only one of five so far during his time in charge at Arsenal – against Manchester City on the victorious FA Cup run in 2019-20, his only trophy to date. He went as strong as possible with his XI, apart from giving Kepa Arrizabalaga a runout in goal.If it was the dream start for Arsenal, it was a nightmare for Rosenior. He had been introduced to the Stamford Bridge crowd before kick-off, striding on to the pitch to applaud the fans but there was only hesitation from his defenders after Jurriën Timber won an early corner off Trevoh Chalobah. “Set piece again,” chorused the Arsenal fans before Rice dropped the kick into the area of maximum discomfort. They have seen this movie before.View image in fullscreenBen White celebrates after opening the scoring from a corner.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesIt was a horrible moment for Sánchez. He was boxed in and ran only into his teammate Marc Cucurella, before stretching up an arm in a vain waft at the ball. White headed down and in from point-blank range.Arsenal brought the intensity. They pressed high. Rosenior roamed his technical area, clapping in quickfire bursts in an attempt to gee up his players but it was tough going before the interval. Chelsea diced with disaster as they tried to play out from the back, Arsenal players hounding them every step of the way. Sánchez looked particularly shaky.Estêvão Willian was a bright spot for the home team. There was a jet-heeled burst from him in the 37th minute, taking him away from a posse of red but then no help from his teammates towards the corner flag. Inevitably, he was crowded out. Moments earlier, he had cut inside to unload a vicious shot with minimal backlift that Arrizabalaga repelled.The Stamford Bridge natives were restless and there were boos from them at half-time. Arsenal had toyed with a second goal, Zubimendi swiping one shot high, William Saliba going close with another and the goal did come after the restart.Arsenal played quickly from a throw-in on the right, Bukayo Saka releasing White on the overlap but the full-back’s low cross looked straightforward for Sánchez. Yet his first move was almost to jump; it was certainly a weird way to set himself and the fumble was a consequence. Gyökeres needed a goal. He will not score an easier one.Sánchez nightmare suggests Rosenior will soon have to show his ruthless sideRead moreGarnacho’s response was well timed because the mood among the home fans was turning. The dissatisfaction at the hierarchy is palpable; many supporters have lost faith in Behdad Eghbali, the co-controlling owner, and the youth-first project that he is overseeing; the trading model. They told him in no uncertain terms that he was “not wanted here”. There were also chants in support of the former owner, Roman Abramovich.Rosenior had introduced Garnacho for the ineffective Marc Guiu and the goal followed a Pedro Neto cross. Garnacho lurked unmarked beyond the back post; a rare Arsenal defensive lapse. He lashed past Arrizabalaga.Back came Arsenal. Zubimendi’s composure was astonishing, his fake-to-shoot move sending Wesley Fofana off towards Fulham Broadway station, the time bought for the shot past Sánchez. The Chelsea goalkeeper would save brilliantly to keep out a volley from the substitute Mikel Merino, while Gabriel Magalhães might have scored from a corner.Arsenal were rampant, although Garnacho took a little wind out of their sails when he rammed a shot down and in after Gabriel could only half-clear following a corner. It was only a little.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupChelseaArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

For the other 70, they couldn’t either. Not from his team, at least. From Albacete Balompié, 17th in the second division, they witnessed something magical. An outrageous goal scored with single second to go was the perfect end to the greatest story they ever told, history made. When the final whistle went, Madrid headed straight down the tunnel, defeated again, while the party began in the Carlos Belmonte.Arbeloa had said he wanted to see Vinícius Júnior dance; instead, it was Albacete’s fans who would, long into the night of their lives. This could not have been any better; at Madrid, things can always get worse, the crisis deepening. Careful what you wish for and all that. “At this club every defeat is a tragedy, so imagine one like this,” Arbeloa said. “Failure is the road to success,” Madrid’s new manager added, insisting he was not afraid, that he had suffered eliminations even worse, but this had hurt.European football: Inter edge Lecce to stretch lead, Bayern earn comeback winRead more“It will make us better. I am not afraid of failure. I have failed lots of times in my life, with knockouts more painful than this. I saw players who wanted to win, I can’t reproach them.” That there were 10 first team players left back in the capital did not take anything from Albacete, nor make any it easier for Madrid to digest. Besides, the home side too had habitual subs playing.Three days afterlosing the Super Cup final, two days aftersacking Xabi Alonso, and one day after Arbeloa took his first session, Madrid were knocked out the Copa del Rey. And it was no fluke, no parked bus, no act of heroic resistance from a team a single point from relegation down to the third tier. Instead, it was entirely deserved, completely brilliant from Albacete and just so, so bad from their visitors and victims. Justice came late, but it was done. What a night this was, what an occasion. “Yes, we can!” the fans chanted; amazingly, they could. And what a way to do it.Quick GuideCourtois condemns 'disgusting' racist chants aimed at ViníciusShowThibaut Courtois has called for action to be taken after an online video appeared to show a group of Albacete fans chanting racist abuse relating to Vinícius Júnior before their Copa del Rey match on Thursday.The Real Madrid goalkeeper, who did not travel for the game, reposted a news clip of the footage with a picture of Vinícius and the caption: 'Enough of the racism. This is shameful!' Madrid lost the last-16 tie 3-2 against second-tier opposition.Courtois has previously spoken out against racist chanting, including in December when Vinícius was targeted by Athletic Bilbao fans. 'I think there's been a bit of a lack of respect, because we're human beings,' the Belgian said.Guardian sportWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.A goal from Javi Villar, a product of Madrid’s academy and two from Jefté Betancor, a 32-year-old Canarian playing at his 22nd club across five countries secured a 3-2 win that will be theirs for ever, echoing even louder because of who they had beaten and when.Albacete were not to be denied. Twice they had led; twice Madrid had levelled, from set plays, from nowhere, and in added time at the end of each half. First it was Franco Mastantuono who seemed to have killed off Albacete’s hopes, then it was García. But when it looked like Madrid may escape somehow, like they had some how rescued this, setting up another of thoseremontadas, Betancor was there again, racing into the Madrid area once more. There, he clipped a glorious shot past Andriy Lunin.View image in fullscreenÁlvaro Arbeloa looks dejected after Real Madrid’s shock defeat.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesMadrid were defeated, and there could be no excuses. Arbeloa didn’t seek them and said he would choose the same team again, even though he had made many changes. These players, he insisted, should be good enough to win any game. Besides, rotations are routine in theCopa del Rey, a competition designed to facilitate the progress of the biggest clubs and where they often offer opportunities to squad players and young talents. Injury had an impact too, as it has all season at Madrid. Then there was a statement to make, although reading too much into the lineup might be ill-advised.The absentees were certainly significant: Kylian Mbappé, Jude Bellingham, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Éder Militão, Álvaro Carreras, Aureliene Tchouaméni, Antonio Rüdiger, Rodrygo, Ferland Mendy and Thibaut Courtois were all left back in Madrid. On a cold, misty night in Albacete, there was no star name to come from the bench should a rescue mission was required. Remarkably, it was. Somehow, it seemed they had succeeded too, García’s late header seeming to usher in extra time.Xabi Alonso failed to control Real Madrid’s egos in brief and bitter reignRead moreDavid Jiménez and Jorge Cestero, who Arbeloa knows from Castilla, were in the starting XI. But as it turned out, the Madrid academy players who made the greatest impact here were wearing Albacete’s white. Arda Guler, Mastantuono and García also started, while Fede Valverde was in midfield rather than full-back, the position about which he had complained. Jiménez did that for him. Completing the 4-3–3, Vinícius was given freedom up front.Madrid might have been brilliant from the beginning, the change from the Xabi Alonso era immediately apparent. They also might not have been. Through the fog that engulfed the pitch, it wasn’t easy to tell. The ball was barely visible, the players mostly just figures that occasionally passed by. In his long black cloak, just a mysterious silhouette in the mist, over on the far touchline Arbeloa looked like the cover of a spy novel. It took 20 minutes or so for the fog to lift, but there still wasn’t much to see.Madrid dominated possession, with Cestero neat and tidy in the No 5 role that Alonso missed so much. By the time the half-hour came round, they had almost 80% of the possession. The problem was that they did nothing with it. Vinícius was unable to get through. Mastantuono was wasteful and García still couldn’t be seen. A long, tame shot from Valverde was all there was.Albacete offered more. Lorenzo Aguado, a former Madrid academy player, dashed towards the area and shot over and, marvellously, the first goal of the Arbeloa era was almost scored by Bernabéu. The 18-year-old Dani Bernabéu robbed Mastantuono, raced through and fired just wide. The home fans responded with a rendition of “yes, we can!” and they could too.View image in fullscreenAlbacete’s players revel in their stunning victory against Real Madrid.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesFive minutes from half-time, Bernabéu won a free-kick from which José Carlos Lazo drew a sharp save from Lunin and then, just as it looked like the rebound had set Madrid free, Vinícius running clean through, he outran the Brazilian to take the ball from him. Two minutes later, Albacete led. Another Madrid academy player, Villar, scored it, thundering a header from Lazo’s corner, the Belmonte erupting in joyous disbelief, the Albacete bench emptying.The board went up with two more minutes which had been played out when the equaliser came, Madrid allowed to take one last corner out of time from which Dean Huijsen’s header brought a superb save by Raúl Lizoain. Mastantuono finished off from close range. That might have been it, the wake-up call that restored normal service. But Madrid did nothing still, their impotence underlined when the roles started ringing round – from the Albacete fans who were soon cheering the second goal. Lunin had to save from Riki and Agus Medina but couldn’t stop Betancor on 82 minutes.History was coming close, only for García to head in an equaliser just as the 90 minute mark passed, a familiar fable of survival. But the same old story was replaced by one that was even better, Betancor heading off to make history. “We’re euphoric, this is a dream,” the Albacete coach, Alberto González, said. For Madrid, the nightmare still isn’t over.Explore more on these topicsReal MadridAlbaceteCopa del Reymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Rashid is in South Africa playing in the SA20 T20 competition, while Ahmed is in Australia for the Big Bash, and it is hoped they will be able to fly from there straight to Sri Lanka or India.The ECB is confident that the visas will be issued in time for Rashid and Ahmed to play in the World Cup, with England’s campaign beginning against Nepal in Mumbai on 8 February, but their preparation has been affected before a tournament they will start under considerable pressure after their 4-1 Ashes defeat.View image in fullscreenShoaib Bashir missed England’s first Test against India two years ago due to a visa delay.Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty ImagesBrendon McCullum, the head coach, will want to reach the semi‑finals at least to ease fears over his own position after England crashed out of the Champions Trophy without winning a game last year in his only previous tournament in charge of the white-ball team; the captain, Harry Brook, will face intense scrutiny following the revelation last week that he was fined £30,000 by the ECB fora nightclub altercation with a bouncerthe night before a one-day international in New Zealand in October.While finishing in the top two in a group completed by West Indies, Bangladesh and Italy should not be beyond England, the Super Eight stage will be far more competitive.England play three one-day internationals and three T20s in Sri Lanka beginning on 22 January, and Brook may have limited spin options at his disposal. Liam Dawson is the only other specialist spinner in the squad, and Will Jacks and Jacob Bethell may be required to do more bowling than expected if the absent duo do not arrive in time to play in the matches.In another political complication, the venue for England’s group game against Bangladesh is uncertain after their opponents requested that theInternational Cricket Councilmove its matches to a neutral venue due to security concerns amid tensions with India.Pakistan’s games have already been moved to Sri Lanka but the Board of Control for Cricket in India is understood to be lobbying the ICC to oppose another scheduling switch.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamT20 World CupECBInternational Cricket CouncilCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Spurs moved quickly for a midfielder they have long admired after losing Rodrigo Bentancur to a hamstring injury at Bournemouth last Wednesday, beating off competition from Aston Villa. Bentancur has since undergone surgery.Tottenham looked at Gallagher at the end of the 2023-24 season only for him to go from Chelsea to Atlético for £34m. Before thePremier Leaguegame between Chelsea and Spurs in May 2024 at Stamford Bridge, the home fans unfurled a banner of Gallagher. “Chelsea since birth,” read the caption about their academy product. The subtext was clear: do not sell him to Tottenham.Paratici talks of ‘need to be based’ in Italy as move from Spurs to Fiorentina confirmedRead moreThe climate is different now, with Gallagher determined to sign for Spurs on a contract until 2031 and play in the Premier League again after a frustrating first half of the season at Atlético, where he started only four times in La Liga.The 25-year-old is also keen to reignite his England hopes before the World Cup this summer. Capped 22 times and a member of the squad at the 2022 World Cup and Euro 2024, he last played for Thomas Tuchel’s team in the friendly defeat by Senegal last June. Gallagher is in contention to make his Spurs debut in the home game against West Ham on Saturday.“I’m so happy and excited to be here, taking the next step in my career at an amazing club,” Gallagher said. “I wanted to be a Spurs player and thankfully the club felt the same. It was very easy. It happened very quickly and I’m ready to get on the pitch. I know how great the fans are, I’m really happy to be a part of it here and want to create special moments and memories together.”Thomas Frank, the Spurs manager, said: “Conor is a top midfielder, who we have worked tirelessly to add to our squad. He is still young so has plenty of room for improvement but also has huge experience across the Premier League, La Liga and with the England national team.“Conor has captained teams so will bring leadership, maturity, character and personality to our dressing room, while his running power, pressing ability and eye for goal will strengthen us in a key area of the pitch.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurPremier LeagueAtlético MadridTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

Wane held discussions with the Rugby Football League this week about his future and those decisions have reached a conclusion, with it decided that the national team will go in a new direction for the World Cup.Wane had insisted previously that he felt he was the right man to take England into the World Cup this year, saying: “I don’t believe – I know I am.”However the interimRFLchair, Nigel Wood, threw doubt on that when he confirmed in an interview late last year that Wane’s position was under review. “We will review all of that, like we always do,” he said.“This isn’t a kind of public examination of any of the coaches.

There is no room in the domestic schedule for a mid-season international going into a World Cup, meaning that it is almost certain the RFL will turn to a part-time appointment.That will probably mean a number of existing Super League coaches are options with Hull KR’s Willie Peters and St Helens’ Paul Rowley likely to be among the contenders.The RFL’s interim chief executive, Abi Ekoku, had insisted previously that the role could become a part‑time one; Wane had been a full‑time employee of the RFL since his appointment in 2020. During that time, he guided England to the 2022 World Cup semi-finals, but their surprise defeat by Samoa in that game is still regarded as a missed opportunity for the sport in the UK.Wane did deliver series victories against Tonga and Samoa in 2023 and 2024 but his side was comfortably second best in the Ashes, leading to fresh scrutiny over his future.Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby league teamRFLRugby leaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Such a move would be controversial, with Reform leading in the polls and vowing to curtail the operational independence of police.The report by Sir Andy Cooke, the chief inspector of constabulary, found several errors in how the West Midlands force gathered intelligence on the risks of Maccabi fans coming toBirmingham.The threat was “greatly exaggerated”, leaving a safety committee that relied on the police intelligence “with little or no option” but to ban them, the report said.It said the force made misleading statements through “confirmation bias” and “carelessness rather than any deliberate distortion”, and not through antisemitism. Nor was it due to bowing to political pressure from those in Birmingham angered by Israel’s alleged genocide in Gaza.The report blamed the force’s leadership and Mahmood was even more damning, saying: “Faced by a game of such importance, the chief constable of the force, Craig Guildford, should have ensured more professional and thorough work was done.“As Sir Andy himself says, the ‘shortcomings’ detailed in his report are, and I quote, ‘symptomatic of a force not applying the necessary strategic oversight and not paying enough attention to important matters of detail, including at the most senior levels’.“The ultimate responsibility for the force’s failure to discharge its duties on a matter of such national importance rests with the chief constable, and it is for that reason that I must declare today that the chief constable of West Midlands police no longer has my confidence.”One senior policing source said Guildford was a “dead man walking”, with the errors “dumbfounding” investigators, the home secretary and her officials.The only person who can oust Guildford is Simon Foster, the police and crime commissioner for the West Midlands.He has praised Guildford for improving the force’s performance and service to the public. He said he would consider Cooke’s report, a second one which is expected from the policing inspectorate and one from MPs on the home affairs committee, as well as subjecting Guildford to a public inquisition on 27 January.The Guardian understands Guildford does not believe that demands from the home secretary necessitate his immediate resignation. He will wait to see whether Foster decides to trigger the process for dismissal. The force leadership believes its decisions kept the public safe but accepts there are clear lessons to be learned.Central to the police case for a ban was what officers claimed Dutch police told them about a Maccabi game in Amsterdam in 2024. Guildford and his force believed Maccabi fans were perpetrators of violence, with the report saying it wrongly blamed them, when it knew of information to the contrary.Testimony from Dutch police to the inquiry,revealed on Monday by the Guardian, crucially undermined the force’s credibility with Cooke – they disputed several claims alleged to have come from them and on which UK police relied.Mahmood said: “The West Midlands police engagement with the Dutch police is one of the most disquieting elements of Sir Andy’s report. The summary, provided as evidence to the safety advisory group … was inaccurate.“Claims, including the number of police officers deployed, links between fans and the Israel Defence Forces, the targeting of Muslim communities, the mass tearing down of Palestinian flags [in Amsterdam], attacks on police officers, and on taxi drivers were all either exaggerated or simply untrue.”The safety group was told Maccabi fans threw Muslims into a river. In fact an Israeli fan was thrown in the water, and Cooke said British police knew that having read official Dutch reports.Mahmood said Cooke’s findings showed that “the police overstated the threat posed by theMaccabi Tel Avivfans, while understating the risk that was posed to the Israeli fans if they travelled to the area” amid intelligence that some people in Birmingham were preparing to arm themselves.Guildford has apologised for the inclusion in his force’s intelligence reports of a Maccabi match against West Ham, which never took place. Cooke said one officer described the error as “an AI hallucination”.West Midlands police said: “We know that mistakes were made but reiterate the findings that none of this was done with an intent of deliberate distortion or discrimination.“West Midlands police is an anti-discriminatory organisation and our planning for this football match was always about public safety of all communities.”Ruth Jacobs, chair of the Birmingham and West Midlands Jewish Community, said of Guildford: “I think the majority of the community would feel that this is the right time to go in view of all the dreadful things that have been revealed.”While Foster said he would wait, Birmingham council’s leader and the West Midlands mayor, both Labour, said Guildford must go.TheWest Midlands mayor, Richard Parker, said: “Significant questions remain unanswered about the timing, rationale and evidence underpinning decisions taken by the police and the Birmingham safety advisory group.“Since the decision to ban away fans, explanations have shifted, evidence has been withdrawn and the HMIC [His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary] report highlights further failures and inconsistencies.“Public trust in policing depends on clarity, transparency and accountability. Recent events have seriously undermined that trust.“I do not believe the chief constable’s position is tenable.”The government’s independent adviser on antisemitism, Lord Mann, also said the chief constable should go: “You can’t be seen to be misleading a committee and that’s not tenable in high public office. If I can find out the straightforward facts, why can’t the West Midlands police?”The independent MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, Ayoub Khan, said Guildford was the victim of a “witch hunt” and “being thrown under the bus”. He insisted West Midlands police “have a reputation for working with all communities” and have “never caved into community pressure”.The Israeli embassy said Maccabi Tel Aviv fans should receive an “appropriate apology” and “concrete” steps must be taken to prevent a similar situation from occurring in future. It added: “We are encouraged that the truth is now coming to light, and we welcome the commitment shown to transparency, accountability and the restoration of public trust.”Explore more on these topicsPoliceMaccabi Tel AvivAston VillaPolice and crime commissionersBirminghamAntisemitismIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

The committee is not expected to begin work until mandated by a “peace board” chaired by Trump, which has yet to be created.Witkoff said the second phase would begin the “full demilitarisation and reconstruction of Gaza, primarily the disarmament of all unauthorised personnel”.The first phase of the ceasefire plan began on 10 October, with the exchange of Israeli hostages held by Hamas and its allies for Palestinian detainees held by Israel. Israeli forces withdrew to ayellow truce linethat left them in control of most of the territory.The Israeli bombardment of Gaza diminished buthas not ceased. About 450 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire began. No agreement has been reached on disarming Hamas.Two groups representing Israeli former hostages and their families had urged the US not to declare the start of the second phase of the ceasefire until the remains of the last hostage yet to be accounted for, Ran Gvili, had been returned by Hamas. Hamas has said it has so far been unable to find Gvili’s body.“The US expects Hamas to comply fully with its obligations, including the immediate return of the final deceased hostage,” Witkoff said. “Failure to do so will bring serious consequences.”Though Witkoff did not provide any details of the proposed Palestinian interim committee, the Egyptian foreign minister, Badr Abdelatty, announced a few hours earlier that an agreement had been reached on all of its 15 members.Abdelatty said the committee would be “deployed to the Gaza Strip to manage daily life and essential services”.The members are expected to be technocrats rather than politicians, but some are believed to have affiliation with the Fatah party, which is dominant in the Palestinian Authority. Two candidates touted as potential heads are Ali Shaath, a former deputy minister of planning in the Palestinian Authority, and Majed Abu Ramadan, the PA health minister.According to diplomats in the region, the work of the Palestinian transitional committee will be overseen by Nickolay Mladenov, a veteran Bulgarian and UN diplomat who has been touring the region holding talks with Israeli and Palestinian officials. Mladenov served as the UN envoy for the Middle East peace process from early 2015 until the end of 2020 and is widely respected across the region.Mladenov in turn would report to Trump’s peace board, which is expected to comprise a group of world leaders. US officials said its membership would be announced in the next few days.Discussions in Cairo on the second phase are said to have also focused on the further withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, the reopening of the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza and the entry of aid stockpiled on the Egyptian side of the border – as well as a general increase in the flow of goods and aid entering Gaza.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineUS foreign policyIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They must act. We will take the necessary measures. We will strengthen existing laws and prepare for legislation if it needs to go further, and Ofcom will continue its independent investigation.”Ofcom, the media regulator,launched its investigation into X on Mondayafter a deluge of sexual images appeared on Musk’s platform.Government officials are understood to have been speaking withX, but ministers are monitoring the impact of the steps taken by the social media site. There is frustration that guardrails other AI providers have put in place to prevent such images being created appear not to be used by Grok.“We are keeping a close watch on the situation,” Starmer said. He spoke as new polling showed 58% of Britons believe X should be banned in the UK if the platform doesn’t crack down on AI-generated, nonconsensual images. More in Common’s research also found 60% believe UK ministers should come off X, and 79% fearAI misuse is set to become a bigger problem.8:34Musk v Starmer: will UK ban X over Grok nudification? | The LatestIn recent days,X is understood to have restrictedthe @grok account, which many users have been asking to partially undress celebrities and others, so it no longer generates images of real people in revealing clothing.The sharing of nonconsensual intimate images, such as those created by asking an AI to put people in underwear and bikinis and in sexual poses,is illegal under the Online Safety Act.Last week, the Internet Watch Foundation, a UK-based watchdog, said it had seen users on a dark web forum boasting ofusing the Grok app to create sexualised and topless imagery of girlsaged between 11 and 13.On Wednesday,Musk saidhe was “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.”“Obviously, Grok does not spontaneously generate images, it does so only according to user requests,” he wrote in an X post. “When asked to generate images, it will refuse to produce anything illegal, as the operating principle for Grok is to obey the laws of any given country or state. There may be times when adversarial hacking of Grok prompts does something unexpected. If that happens, we fix the bug immediately.”To anybody still using X: sexual abuse content is the final straw, it’s time to leave | Marie Le ConteRead moreMeanwhile, Liz Kendall, the technology secretary, renewed her criticism of xAI – the company that owns X and Grok – over its decision to limit Grok’s image generation and editing functions to paying subscribers, calling it “a further insult to victims, effectively monetising this horrific crime”.In a letter to MPs on the Commons select committee for science, innovation and technology, she said a wider ban on AI-enabled nudification tools “will apply to applications that have one despicable purpose only: to use generative AI to turn images of real people into fake nude pictures and videos without their permission”.But the committee chair, Chi Onwuruh, has criticised the government’s slowness in applying the ban given “reports of these disturbing Grok deepfakes appeared in August 2025”.She said it was “unclear whether this ban – which appears to be limited to apps that have the sole function of generating nude images – will cover multipurpose tools like Grok”.Explore more on these topicsGrok AIXElon MuskAI (artificial intelligence)DeepfakeKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

The two floating windfarms were granted a contract that will earn £216.49/MWh.Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, said: “We’ve secured a record-breaking 8.4GW of offshore wind … This is the largest amount of offshore wind procured in any auction ever in Britain or indeed Europe.”He called it “a significant step towards clean power by 2030”, adding: “The price secured in this auction is 40% lower than the alternative cost of building and operating a new gas plant. Clean, homegrown power is the right choice to bring down bills for good, and this auction will create thousands of jobs throughout Britain.”The most successful energy company in the bidding was the German utility RWE, which secured contracts for almost 7GW of offshore wind projects out of the 8.4GW total, including its Dogger Bank South and Norfolk Vanguard windfarms. Shares in the €36bn company climbed by almost 1.5% on Wednesday morning.SSE also won a contract for the first phase of its massive 4.1GW Berwick Bank project off the Scottish coast. The market value of the London-listed company surged in early trading before settling at 0.5% higher by midday.Although the winning bids’ prices are higher than in previous years and above the typical price of electricity in the wholesale power market, which stands at about £81/MWh, experts say the growth of wind power in the UK energy system could still help to keep bills down because they would lower the market price by limiting the use of expensive gas plants.The government said investing in locally generated renewable electricity would also help to reduce the UK’s exposure to volatile global fossil fuel markets, which have contributed to record high energy debts and cost inflation across the UK economy.The success of the auction was considered crucial if the government hoped to achieve its election pledge to double onshore wind, triple solar power and quadruple offshore wind by 2030 with the aim of creating a virtually zero-carbon electricity system by the end of the decade.However, the government will need to repeat the results of its record-breaking auction by securing another 8GW of offshore wind power at similar prices at next year’s allocation round if it hopes to meet its goal of committing to between 43GW to 50GW of offshore wind by 2030.Andy Prendergast, the national secretary of the GMB trade union, said “the real litmus test” of the auction’s success would be “if it delivers the jobs so often promised and so often fail to materialise”.“This is a golden opportunity to on-shore supply chains and create genuine employment opportunities across the UK. It’s imperative that we take it,” Prendergast said.The UK government has faced criticism for accelerating its investment in offshore wind at a time when the technology faces higher costs. Supporters of the industry have argued that speedy investment is key to replacing Britain’s ageing nuclear and gas plants, about half of which are due to close before 2035.“Investment in renewables is also crucial to keep pace with the UK’s need for more energy,” said Ana Musat, a policy director at RenewableUK. “Electricity demand is set to increase significantly in the years ahead as existing nuclear and gas capacity retires, so the 8.4GW awarded contracts today will be crucial for economic growth.”Explore more on these topicsRenewable energyEnergy industryWind powerSolar powerEnergyEd MilibandScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Brent futures rose 1.4% to $66.39.In an update before its full-year results, BP said it continued to slash its debts, reducing net debt to between $22bn and $23bn at the end of the quarter, compared with $26bn at the end of the previous three months.The writedown comes after the oil company’s surprise announcement last month that it had appointed Meg O’Neill as itsthird chief executive in five years. The first female head of a leading oil company, O’Neill will join BP in April from the Australian oil and gas company Woodside.O’Neill replaces Murray Auchincloss, who ran the company for less than two years, as BP hopes to revive its fortunes. Under Auchincloss, the grouppushed further away from the green ambitionsof his predecessor Bernard Looney – who wasdismissed in 2023– in favour of ramping up fossil fuel production.“Put the writedowns together with a weak showing for its oil trading arm and the impact from weaker oil prices, [it] looks like the final set of quarterly results before Meg O’Neill steps into the hot seat in April will be downbeat,” said Dan Coatsworth, the head of markets at the broker AJ Bell.“From O’Neill’s perspective this is no bad thing as it gives her a low base from which to build. However, it does illustrate the scale of the challenge in front of her.”BP’s trading update came as Shell and Exxon Mobil announced they had pulled the plug on a planned sale of natural gas assets in the North Sea to the British oil producer ViaroEnergy.Shell said in a statement that commercial and market conditions had changed since thedeal was struck in July 2024, while it added that conditions needed to complete the sale were not met.Shell will continue to operate the assets, which include 11 gas fields and one exploration prospect in the southern North Sea, as well as an onshore terminal at Bacton on the Norfolk coast.Explore more on these topicsBPOil (Business)Oil and gas companiesEnergy industryOil (Environment)EnergynewsShareReuse this content"

That is more than 10 years sooner than scientists expected when world leaders signed the pledge in 2015.“We are bound to pass it,” said Carlo Buontempo, the director of the Copernicus climate change service. “The choice we now have is how to best manage the inevitable overshoot and its consequences.”The eight datasets published on Wednesday are based on billions of weather measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations. They were separately compiled by several organisations that monitor the global climate in Europe, the US, Japan and China, with minor variations in their results.The WMO’s consolidated analysis found that 2025 was 1.44C hotter than the preindustrial period, when the large-scale destruction of nature and burning of coal, oil and gas began in earnest. Six datasets ranked 2025 as the third hottest year on record, while the other two ranked it as the second hottest.The hottest year on record since the mid-19th century is 2024, which was plagued by heatwaves and wildfires. The Met Office said natural variation and reductions in heat-masking aerosol pollutants have made the last fewyears extra hot.Tim Osborn, the director of the University of East Anglia’s climate research unit, which worked with the Met Office to produce the data, said a natural weather pattern in the Pacific known as El Niño added about 0.1C to global temperatures in 2023 and 2024, which contributed to the “abrupt onset of the recent temperature surge”.View image in fullscreenVisitors to the Sensoji temple in Tokyo take advantage of a cooling mist during a heatwave in August 2025.Photograph: Issei Kato/Reuters“This natural influence weakened by 2025,” he said. “And therefore the global temperature we observed in 2025 provides a clearer picture of the underlying warming.”Copernicus said the first month of 2025 was the hottest January on record, while March, April and May were each the second-warmest for that time of year. Each month except February and December was warmer than the corresponding month in any year before 2023, the scientists found.The unnatural heat is largely the result of a blanket of carbon pollution smothering the Earth, worsening most weather extremes and jeopardising the stable conditions in which humanity has thrived.Copernicus found temperatures over the tropical Atlantic and Indian Ocean were less extreme in 2025 than in 2024, but these were offset partly by higher temperatures at the poles. Antarctica recorded its hottest year, and the Arctic its second-hottest.Polar sea ice cover fell to its lowest level since satellite observations began in the 1970s in February. Over the year as a whole, half of the planet’s land experienced more days than average with at least “strong” heat stress, when temperatures feel above 32C.Berkeley Earth, a US non-profit that also analysed the temperatures, estimates that 8.5% of the world’s population live in areas that had record high annual average temperatures last year. Its scientists said similar heat was likely in 2026.Bill McGuire, an emeritus professor of climate hazards at University College London, who was not involved in the analysis, said the findings were “grim but far from unexpected tidings”.“To all intents and purposes, the 1.5C limit is now dead in the water,” he said. “Whichever way you look at it, dangerous climate breakdown has arrived, but with little sign that the world is prepared or even paying serious attention.”In the US, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) noted that the largest heat anomalies were in Europe, the Arctic, western and southern Asia and parts of Antarctica.Unlike previous years, there was no media fanfare or public-facing event staged by Noaa and Nasa for their annual temperature reports. Instead, the data was published quietly on their websites on Wednesday morning.Under Donald Trump, US government agencies have removed or downgraded information on the climate crisis, banned mentions relating to global heating and fired researchers involved in a periodic report, required by Congress, that updates the latest climate science and impacts in the US.“The Trump administration is not simply refusing to face the reality of climate change we are experiencing, it is actively lying about the science and undermining our nation’s federal scientific resources,” said Dr Carlos Martinez, a senior climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit advocacy organisation.“It is acting like there’s no tomorrow by trying to force even more burning of coal, oil and gas, which will cost lives and make the Earth a harder place to live in the years to come.”Global emissions have continued to rise 10 years after the Paris agreement was signed, despite a boom in renewable energy and regional successes in cleaning up dirty economies.Laurence Rouil, the director of the Copernicus atmosphere monitoring service, said the data for 2025 painted a clear picture that showed human activity was still the dominant driver of exceptional temperatures.“The atmosphere is sending us a message,” she said. “And we must listen.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisGreenhouse gas emissionsExtreme heatParis climate agreementnewsShareReuse this content"

Her sheep nosedived into the grass under their shelter and began to graze.“When I first started out, 18 acres and 20 sheep was as much as I could afford,” said the first-generationfarmer. “Now, because I can graze this land for free, I have 250 acres and over 200 sheep. Solar grazing has given me a massive leg-up.”Across the UK, a growing number of farmers are discovering that the free grazing opportunities offered by somesolarpanel sites are a toe-hold in an industry where land is often unaffordable or unobtainable.Dr Liz Genever, a farmer in south-east Lincolnshire, has been able to triple her sheep numbers thanks to free solar grazing.“If I could increase my flock to the full potential offered by the local solar site, I could potentially increase my income from sheep from £20,000 to £60,000,” she said. “There’s been a massive acceleration in the last five years in solar grazing. “It’s a really important opportunity for sheep farmers.”The opportunity could not have come at a better time. The UK has traditionally been largely self-sufficient in sheep meat. But high feed and farming costs, market uncertainty and low profitability have seen flocks fall to their lowest number ever recorded.View image in fullscreenSheep graze on the grass under the panels that would otherwise need to be mown.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianNicola Noble, of the National Sheep Association, agreed the free solar grazing was a “valuable opportunity for new, younger or smaller farmers”.Solar grazing is the practice of using sheep to manage vegetation on solar farms. Panels need grassland beneath them. On a typical site, that means tens of acres of grass that needs mowing or spraying, costing up to £50,000 annually.By using sheep, however, those costs fall dramatically. Sheep do not require heavy mowing equipment to be hauled across the country on diesel lorries, or need tea breaks. They slip between panel legs and nibble where machines cannot reach. And they work in all weathers.Grazing is so effective that in areas where there aren’t enough flocks, shepherds could start being paid for their services, said Murray Sellars, co-founder of the eco-friendly land management company, GroundGraze.Not every site is suitable for solar grazing. But for those that are, it is a triple-win solution for the farming business, for renewables and for society, said Emilien Simonot, of Lightsource BP, which oversees one of the largest sheep-grazing programmes in the UK.Prof Alona Armstrong, the director of energy and environmental science at Lancaster University, agreed. “This sort of multiple land use is vital,” she said.A recent study showed that sheep grazing in the shade of solar panels may produce higher-quality wool than those on traditional agricultural properties.But not everyone buys the “triple win” argument. Fraser Key, a fourth-generation farmer who built a 15-megawatt solar farm on his land in 2012, is both advocate and sceptic. Back in 2012, his site generated 25% more income than conventional farming.“Today, that would be 100% because most farms are losing so much money,” he said, grimly. But Key has turned solar grazing into a profitable business – even supplementing what he is paid for leasing his land to the solar company by charging local shepherds to graze their flocks beneath the panels.“Solar grazing is a very good thing,” he conceded. “But the drive to cover agricultural land with panels is dangerous. We can’t decimate the agricultural community in the process.”Guy Parker, founder and co-director of Wychwood Biodiversity Limited, agreed that grazing can be beneficial to wildlife – but only at lower stocking densities. “Grazing is maximised on some solar farms, which minimises thebiodiversityvalue,” he said.Noble said there was also a risk of it becoming a PR exercise; a way to make communities more comfortable with planning applications. She said: “Sometimes solar companies promise to consider grazing at the planning stage. Then the grazing never happens.”Solar grazing will not fix British farming. It won’t lower land prices, reverse climate change or make supermarkets pay more for lamb. But for farmers locked out of land, it offers something increasingly rare: a way in.View image in fullscreenSupporters say the setup is a triple-win, benefiting the farming business, renewables and society.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianBack in Lincolnshire, Thorogood listed the benefits: “The sheep improve soil quality, increase pasture diversity and mean the land doesn’t need spraying,” she said.“The land is secure, because there are cameras everywhere, and the tech teams keep an eye on the flock,” she said. “The panels give the sheep shelter in snow and extreme heat.”For Thorogood, standing between the panels, the politics fall away: what’s left is grass and shelter for her flock – and a farmer who finally knows where she stands.Explore more on these topicsSolar powerFarmingRenewable energyEnergyBiodiversityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A further raid was conducted on a property in Venice, with the assistance of Italy’s Guardia di Finanza.‘We owe our landlord £1m in rent – but they’ve left us with substandard homes’Read moreHome Reit was established in 2020 as the first London-listed property fund tackling homelessness and had ambitions to grow into a £1bn business and take 10,000 people off the street.It raised £850m and used investor money to buy and restore properties to be let by publicly funded charities to house rough sleepers, veterans and people struggling with addiction. Returns to investors would come from rent payments.However, the company was accused ofproviding substandard accommodationthat resulted in charities withholding rents.Ellie Reeves, the government’s solicitor general, said: “The allegations in this case are deeply serious. Vulnerable people, including rough sleepers and veterans, were promised homes, while investors who funded millions of pounds were promised returns. Both groups deserve answers.”The shares also came under pressure after the publication of a report byViceroy Research, an analysis company best known for predicting the crisisat Germany’s Wirecard.The stock exchange suspended trading in Home Reit shares in January 2023, by which time the value of the company had shrunk by more than 70%.It emerged in June 2024 that the Noble Tree Foundation, a homelessness charity that was one of Home Reit’s larger creditors, hadentered administration and was not paying rent. The charity had already been in a standoff with the fund after withholding rents because of the condition of its properties, some of which had black mould and leaking ceilings.Emma Luxton, the SFO’s director of operations, said: “This company had a meteoric rise, spending millions on properties that were supposed to house the most vulnerable in society and provide returns for investors. Its chaotic downfall has left many with unanswered questions.”Home Reit, which said it was in the process of a “managed wind-down”, said it had “been made aware of reports of the SFO’s arrests and raids. Naturally the company will provide any assistance it is able to the SFO in pursuing its investigations”.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

If it were to lose it, the company would fall into a special administration regime until a new buyer was found.If the regulator, Ofwat, decides the company has breached its licence but decides not to revoke it, penalties include a fine of 10% of the company’s annual turnover. Ofwat in 2024 decided Thames Water was in breach of its licence but decided to avoid forcing it into special measures and insteadinsisted on a turnaround plan.‘It’s pretty grim’: Tunbridge Wells residents struggle through several days without water – againRead moreThis week 30,000 properties faced having low or no water, and 17,000 are thought to still be affected, with many of them in Tunbridge Wells. This is thesecond time in as many monthsthat the Kent town has been without water, after the taps ran dry for 24,000 households for two weeks in the run-up to Christmas.The company has blamed bad weather for leaks in its ageing pipe system that caused water outages across its network.Watercompanies have a statutory duty to maintain a sufficient supply of wholesome water to their customers.Reynolds said: “Today I met with local residents in Tunbridge Wells who are facing huge levels of disruption to their water supplies. It’s completely unacceptable, I recognise their frustrations and want to thank people for pulling together. I’m calling on the chair of South East Water to explain why this continues to happen and Ofwat to review if the company is meeting the requirements of its operating licence.“These failures cannot continue to happen. This government is reforming our water system and securing investment into our infrastructure, to avoid incidents like this in future.”David Hinton, the chief executive of South East Water, has faced cross-party political pressure including from the Liberal Democrat MP for Tunbridge Wells, Mike Martin, to resign after failing to appear in public during both crises. At a recent environment, food and rural affairs parliamentary committee hearing, Hinton gave himself an eight out of 10 for dealing with water shortages.He has a base salary of £400,000 and received a bonus of £115,000 last year. He told the committee that he did not do interviews during the last outage because the questions would focus on his pay and bonus, which he believed would have been a distraction.NatWest Group Pension Fund, a major shareholder in the company, issued a rare warning. The fund, which owns 25% of South East Water, said it was “extremely concerned” by the impact the outage was having on households, adding it would use its influence to put pressure on the board to resolve the issues.The water shortages inKentand Sussex follow a torrid few years for the entire water industry in England. The sewage scandal, where companies have been dumping quantities of raw sewage into rivers and off the British coast, has led to calls for the industry to be renationalised. Growing financial challenges and a lack of accountability mean the sector is sometimes depicted as a textbook example of the drawbacks of privatisation.No water companies have yet been taken out of private ownership as a result of dumping sewage.An Ofwat spokesperson said: “We are concerned that residents in Kent and Sussex are without water again and are working with the Drinking Water Inspectorate, which is the lead regulator for this latest supply interruption, to ensure that regulation and enforcement is aligned.“Ofwat already has an active investigation into South East Water related to its supply resilience, and we have met with the company to discuss these latest incidents as part of that investigation.“We will review all of the evidence before taking a decision on what further action may be required into whether the company has met its legal obligations set out in its licence relating to customer care, including with further potential enforcement action.” =The water company said it was doing “everything” it could to support affected customers and its repair teams were working “around the clock” to restore supplies. “The company will always fully co-operate with any investigation by our regulators and provide any information required.”The company has previously said of Hinton: “David Hinton, chief executive, remains committed to resolving the immediate issues facing customers in both Kent and Sussex, whilst continuing to seek to obtain the investment to deliver the much needed improvements in resilience to the South East Water network, detailed in the company’s business plan.”On Wednesday South East Water informed customers it had a “plan” to restore their water, with some in East Grinstead told they could expect their taps to be working on Thursday morning, while Tunbridge Wells residents were told they would have their water back by Friday.However, local Lib Dem MP Mike Martin said: “I don’t expect the water situation to get better before the weekend at least.”He added: “Longer term, both Ed Davey and I and the Government need to be looking at this water licence for South East Water because they are not providing a plentiful wholesome supply of water. That is the key wording in their licence so we will be holding them to account.”Explore more on these topicsWater industryRegulatorsWaterUtilitiesKentnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2017, hebrought the date forward to 2025.However,figures from MBRRACE-UK, a research project led by the University of Oxford, show the rate of women dying during the Conservatives’ 14 years in government went up, not down.Health leaders and campaigners said the 20% increase between 2009-11 and 2022-24 was shocking and showed something had clearly “gone badly wrong”.The rate of indirect maternal deaths, caused by pre-existing conditions exacerbated by pregnancy was largely unchanged over the last 15 years, up 3%. However, the number of deaths linked directly to pregnancy, including from bleeding, blood clots and pre-eclampsia, grew by 52%.The leading cause of death during pregnancy or up to six weeks afterward was blood clots, which can generally be resolved if spotted and treated early enough.“Progress towards the government ambition to reduce maternal mortality by 50% between 2010 and 2025 in England can be assessed by comparing the rates of maternal deaths between 2009-11 and 2022-24,”the report said. “Over this time, the maternal mortality rate in the UK has increased by 20%.”Prof Marian Knight, the MBRRACE-UK programme lead, said the rise was “very concerning, especially as pressures on maternity services have not eased”.Dr Kim Thomas, the chief executive of the charity the Birth Trauma Association, said: “The new data showing a steep rise in maternal deaths since 2009 is shocking, particularly given the previous government’s commitment to halve the rate of maternal death by 2025.“The deaths are mainly from complications such as pre-eclampsia and blood clots, which can be treated effectively if identified and acted on in a timely fashion. Unfortunately, as a charity, we often hear stories from women of life-threatening conditions being missed, and it is clear that something has gone badly wrong in maternity care.”Thomas added: “We find it extremely concerning that in the UK, a country with the medical knowledge and expertise to stop these deaths from happening, they are in fact increasing.”The audit also exposed stark inequalities. There was a nearly threefold difference in death rates for black women compared to white women. Asian women also faced a higher risk of death than white women.Women living in the most deprived areas of the UK had a maternal death rate nearly twice that of those living in the least deprived areas. Meanwhile, women aged 35 or above were nearly twice as likely to die during or shortly after pregnancy than those aged 25 to 29.The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) said women were being failed by a maternity system under “extreme pressure”.Clare Livingstone, the head of professional policy and practice at the RCM, said: “This is an absolute tragedy for women, babies and the midwives and maternity support workers who care for them. Many are avoidable and the lack of progress over more than a decade is unacceptable.“Maternity services are stretched to capacity. Midwives are working under relentless pressure and that has a real and demonstrable impact on safety, continuity of care and outcomes for women.“Unacceptable inequalities continue to blight maternity care, with black and Asian women and those living in the most deprived communities facing significantly higher risks.“These disparities have been known about for years yet meaningful action has been far too slow. There has been a failure to invest sufficiently in maternity services over many years.”UntilNHSmaternity services were properly resourced and workforce shortages addressed, women would continue to experience “preventable harm”, Livingstone added.Explore more on these topicsNHSPregnancyMaternal mortalityHealth policyHealthWomenRacenewsShareReuse this content"

As the midterm elections approach, a period when shifts in party control are common, Trump urged Texas officials to redraw their maps to boost Republican seats.In response, GovernorGavin Newsomand other Democratic leaders in California pushed for a special statewide vote. The election asked residents whether the state should adopt interim district maps aimed at flipping five Republican-held districts, including one formerly represented by the late congressman Doug LaMalfa.Prop 50: Californians pass redistricting measure that helps Democrats flip up to five House seatsRead moreAfter voters approved Prop 50, Republican opponents challenged the maps in court. They argued that the initiative violated the Voting Rights Act by intentionally crafting districts to advantage Hispanic and Latino voters.The judges, however, rejected that argument in a 2–1 ruling on Wednesday. Supporters and critics of the measure now expect the dispute to advance to the US supreme court, which previously allowed Texas’s revised district lines to stand.“Republicans’ weak attempt to silence voters failed,” Newsom said in astatementshortly after the ruling. “California voters overwhelmingly supported Prop 50 – to respond to Trump’s rigging in Texas – and that is exactly what this court concluded.”In themajority opiniondenying a request to pause implementation of the maps, the judges wrote: “The United States fails to show that the voters acted with discriminatory intent.”The supreme court ruling that partisan gerrymandering claims are not subject to judicial review meansRepublicanschallenging the California maps face the same hurdle Democrats encountered in Texas: demonstrating that race, rather than political affiliation, drove the redistricting process.In their lawsuit, Republicanscited remarksfrom Democratic legislators and a redistricting consultant indicating that the plan retained several districts originally created by an independent commission to enhance representation for voters of color. While such districts are permitted under federal law, the lawsuit claimed Democrats failed to follow the proper procedures in maintaining them.Democrats countered that the racial gerrymandering accusations were unsupported. They pointed to an independent analysis showing no increase in the number of districts with Latino-majority populations. They also highlighted public statements from Newsom and other party leaders asserting that the revised maps were intended to offset Republican advances in Texas, not to target voters based on race.Two judges – Josephine Staton, appointed by Barack Obama, and Wesley Hsu, appointed by Joe Biden – ruled in California’s favor. Judge Kenneth K Lee, a Trump appointee to the ninth circuit court of appeals, dissented, arguing that Democrats had crafted at least one district in southern California “to prevent Latino voters from drifting away from the party”.The maps approved under Prop 50 will govern congressional elections in 2026, 2028, and 2030. Since the passage of voter initiatives in 2008 and 2010, California has relied on an independent,citizen-led commissionto redraw district lines following each census.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaHouse of RepresentativesUS CongressGavin NewsomWest CoastUS politicsNEC NijmegennewsShareReuse this content"

The animal is thought to have died 14,400 years ago when a landslide collapsed its den, trapping the cub and others inside.The frigid conditions preserved the wolf for millennia and on examining the remains, scientists found its stomach contents were also intact. Part of the wolf’s last meal was a chunk of woolly rhino, a hefty herbivore that died out about 14,000 years ago.The discovery marked a rare opportunity, said Dr Camilo Chacón-Duque, who until recently was a researcher at the Centre for Palaeogenetics, a collaboration between Stockholm University and the Swedish Museum of Natural History. If they could obtain the rhino’s genetic makeup from the partially digested meat, it might reveal the state of the species as it headed for extinction.View image in fullscreenThe preserved wolf cub found in Tumat, Siberia.Photograph: Mietje GermonpréView image in fullscreenThe piece of woolly rhino tissue found inside the stomach of the wolf.Photograph: Love DalénWhile there is a paucity of well-preserved specimens from the dying days of many species, recovering genomes from animals that lived right before extinction is “challenging”, Chacón-Duque said. But in principle the genetic code could provide valuable clues about the events that caused the animals to die out.Writing inGenome Biology and Evolution, the researchers describe how they decoded the woolly rhino’s genome from the matted piece of meat. It is the first time the feat has been achieved for an ice age beast found in the stomach of another animal. “To our knowledge this is the youngest woolly rhinoceros for which we have the genome,” Chacón-Duque said.‘They didn’t de-extinct anything’: can Colossal’s genetically engineered animals ever be the real thing?Read moreThe scientists expected to see signs of “genomic erosion”, where a species in decline loses genetic diversity, often through population bottlenecks, inbreeding and environmental pressures. This, combined with an accumulation of harmful mutations, makes species more vulnerable to extinction. But it was not what the researchers saw.“What we found was nothing like that,” Chacón-Duque said. After comparing the woolly rhino’s DNA with genomes from two older specimens dated to 18,000 and 49,000 years ago, the researchers concluded that the population remained fairly large and stable before dying out quite rapidly. “Whatever killed the species was relatively fast,” Chacón-Duque added, and probably struck in the 300 to 400 years before the woolly rhino was lost.View image in fullscreenThe remains of a permafrost-preserved woolly rhinoceros found elsewhere.Photograph: Mammoth museum of North-Eastern Federal UniversityLove Dalén, professor of evolutionary genomics at the Centre for Palaeogenetics, said woolly rhinos appeared to have had a viable population for 15,000 years after the first humans arrived in the region, suggesting that a warming climate rather than hunting wiped them out. The main culprit was an abrupt period of warming in the last ice age, known as the Bølling-Allerød Interstadial, which transformed the landscape between 14,700 and 12,900 years ago.How the wolf cub came to be feeding on woolly rhino is unclear, but it may have scavenged on the carcass after it was killed by the pack, or received the treat from a pack member that regurgitated the hairy morsel.The remains of a second wolf cub, thought to be the sister of the first, were found at the same site in 2015. Tests showed that both had begun to eat solids butwere still taking milkfrom their mother.Explore more on these topicsExtinct wildlifeRussiaSwedennewsShareReuse this content"

The entire institution stands by those freedoms and our work.”“It’s a clear and appalling sign that this administration will set no limits on its acts of aggression against an independent press,” Marty Baron, the Post’s former executive editor, told the Guardian.Murray said neither the newspaper nor Natanson were told they were the target of a justice department investigation.Pam Bondi, the attorney general, said ina post on Xthat the raid was conducted by the justice department and FBI at the request of the Pentagon.The warrant, she said, was executed “at the home of a Washington Post journalist who was obtaining and reporting classified and illegally leaked information from a Pentagon contractor. The leaker is currently behind bars.”The statement gave no further details of the raid or investigation. Bondi added: “TheTrump administrationwill not tolerate illegal leaks of classified information that, when reported, pose a grave risk to our nation’s national security and the brave men and women who are serving our country.”The reporter’s home and devices were searched, and her Garmin watch, phone, and two laptop computers, one belonging to her employer, were seized, the newspaper said. It added that agents told Natanson she was not the focus of the investigation, and was not accused of any wrongdoing.A warrant obtained bythe Postcited an investigation into Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a system administrator in Maryland with a top secret security clearance who has been accused of accessing and taking home classified intelligence reports.Natanson, the Post said, covers the federal workforce and has been a part of the newspaper’s “most high-profile and sensitive coverage” during the first year of the second Trump administration.As the paper noted in its report, it is “highly unusual and aggressive for law enforcement to conduct a search on a reporter’s home”.In afirst-person accountpublished last month, Natanson described herself as the Post’s “federal government whisperer”, and said she would receive calls day and night from “federal workers who wanted to tell me how President Donald Trump was rewriting their workplace policies, firing their colleagues or transforming their agency’s missions”.“It’s been brutal,” the article’s headline said.Natanson said her work had led to 1,169 new sources, “all current or former federal employees who decided to trust me with their stories”. She said she learned information “people inside government agencies weren’t supposed to tell me”, saying that the intensity of the work nearly “broke” her.The federal investigation into Perez-Lugones, the Post said, involved documents found in his lunchbox and his basement, according to anFBIaffidavit. The criminal complaint against him does not accuse him of leaking classified information, the newspaper said.Press freedom groups were united in their condemnation of the raid on Wednesday.“Physical searches of reporters’ devices, homes and belongings are some of the most invasive investigative steps law enforcement can take,” Bruce D Brown, president of the Reporters’ Committee for Freedom of the Press, said in a statement.“There are specific federal laws and policies at the Department of Justice that are meant to limit searches to the most extreme cases because they endanger confidential sources far beyond just one investigation and impair public interest reporting in general.“While we won’t know the government’s arguments about overcoming these very steep hurdles until the affidavit is made public, this is a tremendous escalation in the administration’s intrusions into the independence of the press.”Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute, demanded a public explanation from the justice department of “why it believes this search was necessary and legally permissible”.In a statement, Jaffer said: “Any search targeting a journalist warrants intense scrutiny because these kinds of searches can deter and impede reporting that is vital to our democracy.“Attorney General Bondi has weakened guidelines that were intended to protect the freedom of the press, but there are still important legal limits, including constitutional ones, on the government’s authority to use subpoenas, court orders, and search warrants to obtain information from journalists.“Searches of newsrooms and journalists are hallmarks of illiberal regimes, and we must ensure that these practices are not normalized here.”Seth Stern, chief of advocacy for the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said it was “an alarming escalation in the Trump administration’s multipronged war on press freedom” and called the warrant “outrageous”.“The administration may now be in possession of volumes of journalist communications having nothing to do with any pending investigation and, if investigators are able to access them, we have zero faith that they will respect journalist-source confidentiality,” he said.Tim Richardson, journalism and disinformation program director at PEN America, said: “A government action this rare and aggressive signals a growing assault on independent reporting and undermines the First Amendment.“It is intended to intimidate sources and chill journalists’ ability to gather news and hold the government accountable. Such behavior is more commonly associated with authoritarian police states than democratic societies that recognize journalism’s essential role in informing the public.”The Post has had a rocky relationship with the Trump administration in recent months, despite its billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, attempting to curry favor by blocking it from endorsing Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, in the 2024 presidential election.Bezos defended the action, which sawthe desertion of more than 200,000 subscribersin protest.Explore more on these topicsUS newsTrump administrationWashington PostNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesUS press and publishingUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The participants saw clips from the horror movieSinister, or more joyful scenes from films such asSingin’ in the Rain.To see how horses responded to fearful and joyful odours, the scientists stapled the cotton swabs to the animals’ muzzles, positioning them directly over the horses’ nostrils.Tests then assessed how frequently the horses approached and touched their handler, and how they reacted when an umbrella suddenly popped open in front of them as they munched on a bucket of food.Writing in the journalPlos One, the scientists describe how horses were more startled, had higher peak heart rates, and made less contact with their handlers when exposed to sweat from the scared people. Measurements of the stress hormone, cortisol, found no differences, however.Dr Plotine Jardat, the first author on the study and a researcher at the French Horse and Riding Institute near Tours, said while people might struggle to control the odours they emitted, riders and those caring for horses should be aware of their emotions and the impact they could have.“Arriving relaxed and in a positive mood can foster a better interaction with the horse, whereas if you are afraid yourself, the horse can feel afraid in response and react more strongly to a potentially scary situation,” she said.Prof Biagio D’Aniello at the University of Naples Federico II has shown that bothhorsesanddogscan smell human fear.“The findings add to growing evidence that emotional signals can cross species boundaries, with horses reacting to human fear via smell,” he said. “This raises intriguing questions about how human stress or calmness might shape everyday human-horse interactions, from training to clinical handling.”Explore more on these topicsAnimal behaviourHorsesAnimal welfareMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

It arrived to relief rather than rejoicing from Labour mayors. They were happy, at last, to get moving.A brief recap: the world’s most expensive and long-delayed rail line, HS2, was originally due to speed passengers from London to Birmingham and north on two separate legs to Manchester and Leeds.The northern legs were lopped off in 2023 by Rishi Sunak, the then prime minister, to widespread indignation from Labour leaders.That left Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR), a new east-west network originally designed to replace the region’s Victorian-era tracks with a fully electrified high-speed line. But that too was significantly scaled back under successive Conservative governments.And now, 11 years and six prime ministers since it was first conceived, anew version of NPRis on the horizon. So too is a Birmingham-Manchester line, albeit in about 20 years.Hailed by the government as “the biggest transformation to travel in the north in a generation”, the proposals were warmly welcomed by Labour mayors and business groups. But big questions remain.Whitehall officials haunted by the ghost of HS2 have committed only £1.1bn to the project up to 2029, imposing a “cap” of £45bn on spending thereafter.Any costs over that will have to be funded by northern leaders, most likely through increasing business rates (like the Crossrail levy in London), an as yet nonexistent tourist tax, or borrowing.How much the likes of Greater Manchester and Liverpool will need to stump up is unclear – it depends on the scope, design and nature of the plans – but it is expected to be in the billions. Would highly-taxed businesses swallow another overhead?The timing is also vague. The first phase – an upgrade of the lines connecting Sheffield, Leeds, Bradford and York, with a new station for Bradford – is expected to be completed “in the 2030s”.The following two phases (or three, depending how you count it) would follow after that. The Birmingham-Manchester line is not expected to even start until the 2040s, so unblocking the Midlands bottleneck is a distant prospect.Labour mayors have given their backing to the plans. Yet arriving at this stage took months of behind-the-scenes arm wrestling with Whitehall.One mayor said Treasury mandarins kept presenting “the cheapest” options, which is why NPR was not announced around the time of Labour party conference in September. “The starting point was all wrong [but] we’ve ended up with something that’s workable.”Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, held out until the last minute over concerns about the funding and a perceived lack of commitment to his vision for an underground terminal at Piccadilly, the city’s bustling main station.They are expected to present a united front beside Rachel Reeves when the chancellor speaks at a rail depot in Yorkshire on Wednesday – but whether that fragile peace will hold is doubtful.Burnham is not the only mayor who did not get everything what he wanted; Tracy Brabin, the West Yorkshire mayor, has been irritated by the government’s dithering over a tram network for Leeds, Europe’s biggest city without a mass-transit system.Four years ago, Labouraccusedthe Conservative government of “the great train robbery” when Boris Johnson abandoned plans for a new high-speed line between Manchester and Leeds and HS2 from Birmingham to the latter.Instead, the then transport secretary, Grant Shapps, announced a new fast line between Warrington, Manchester and the edge of West Yorkshire, with upgrades across the Pennines. Liverpool and Hull losing out.The latest proposals look similar to those Labour described as a “betrayal” at the time. There will be a partly new line between Liverpool and Manchester and a new station in Bradford but the rest of the 70-mile route is already being upgraded as part ofan £11bn programmeannounced in 2015.Again, Hull misses out. Its Lib Dem council leader, Mike Ross, decried it as an “absolutely shocking failure by Labour”. A long-anticipated plan to reopen the Leamside line, running from Gateshead to County Durham, has been backed by the government, although government officials have yet to sign off the business proposal so this “once-in-a-generation project” – as the Labour mayor of the North East, Kim McGuinness, has called it – is still at the early stages.Ambitions for the new services to be “high speed” appear to have been shelved. The phrase does not appear once in Labour’s “landmark” announcement, although ministers say the improvements will cut outrageously-long journey times.Anyone travelling the 29 miles between Liverpool and Manchester airport will have wondered why it can take just short of an hour and half, when the longer journey between London Paddington and Reading takes just 22 minutes.In Whitehall, officialspreviously scepticalof upgrading northern trains now see the benefits. They believe poor transport is to blame for the north’s cities lagging behind other major European countries on productivity.Getting the north’s biggest combined authorities – Greater Manchester, Liverpool city region, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and the North East – to UK average productivity levels would add £15bn a year to Treasury coffers, according to government estimates.In a sluggish economy, many of these areas are already going in the right direction: Greater Manchester is growing four times as fast as the UK average, Sheffield and Newcastle are growing twice as fast. Liverpool, Leeds, York and Hull are all growing faster than London on economic value per person.Yet everywhere except London and the south-east remainless productivethan the UK average in terms of output per hours worked – significantly so in the Midlands, Yorkshire, Humberside and the north-east.All of this, of course, is contingent on Labour winning the next election – and potentially the one after that. Having finally got moving, mayors will hope that this time they will eventually reach their destination.Explore more on these topicsRail transportNorth of EnglandTransportanalysisShareReuse this content"

The newspaper added that the private equity firms Apollo, KKR and Centurium Capital, the backer of fast-growing Chinese chain LuckinCoffee, were involved earlier in the auction process, which was handled by the investment bank Lazard.Coca-Cola’s outgoing chief executive, James Quincey, who will move to become the company’s executive chair at the end of March, previously told investors that Costa had “not quite delivered” for the soft drinks company and was “not where we wanted it to be from an investment hypothesis point of view”.Quincey will be succeeded by Coca-Cola’s chief operating officer, Henrique Braun, and the company has reportedly not definitively ruled out selling Costa in the future.Costa, which has about 2,700 outlets across the UK and Ireland, has been squeezed by rising costs and faced competition from upmarket rivals such as Gail’s and independent coffee shops, as well as cheaper offerings from the likes of Greggs and McDonald’s.On Wednesday, the independently owned coffee chain rival Caffè Nero said sales in the UK rose 5% at established stores and 7% in total to £185.4m in the six months to the end of November despite difficult conditions on high streets.Costa was founded in 1971 by Italian brothers, Sergio and Bruno Costa, and sold to Whitbread in 1995 for £19m. When Coca-Cola bought the business, Quincey said there were “great opportunities for value creation”.Costa made revenues of £1.2bn in its 2024 financial year, according to its most recent annual accounts filed at Companies House, only 1% higher than in 2023. However, its operating losses widened from a year earlier to £13.5m, which the company blamed on “challenging conditions with soft footfall and growth of value-led competitors”.Coca-Cola and Costa Coffee were approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsCoca-ColaFood & drink industryCoffeePrivate equityFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

Central bankers and chief executives have since startedrallying around the Fed, raising concerns about political interference in monetary policy.Jerome Powell: steely Fed chair standing firm in face of Trump’s threatsRead moreHowever, Trump defended his campaign against Powell on Tuesday, saying: “I think it’s fine what I’m doing. And we have a bad Fed person.”When asked about thecomments by Dimon, who warned against chipping away at the Fed’s independence, Trump said: “I think he’s wrong.“We should have lower [interest] rates.Jamie Dimonprobably wants higher rates, maybe he makes more money that way.”Trump also said on Tuesday during a factory tour in Michigan that he would continue with the plans to announce a replacement for Powell, whom he appointed in 2018, within “the next few weeks”.It came hours after Dimon told reporters that he had “enormous respect” for Powell, adding: “Everyone we know believes in Fed independence.“And anything [that] chips away at that is probably not a great idea, and in my view, will have the reverse consequences. It’ll raise inflation expectations and probably increase [interest] rates over time.”The chief executive of the Bank of New York Mellon, Robin Vince, also warned that there would be consequences to threatening the Fed’s independence.“Independent central banks with the ability to independently set monetary policy ‍in the long-term interests of the nation is a pretty well-established thing that we’ve seen all around the world over a very long period of time,” Vince told reporters on Tuesday, according to Reuters.“Let’s not shake the foundation of the bond market ⁠and potentially do something that could cause interest rates to actually get pushed up because somehow there’s ‍lack of confidence in the Fed’s independence.”It emerged overnight that Powell had written to US senators last July with details about the Federal Reserve’s $2.5bn (£1.9bn) renovation project,with the Financial Times suggestingthis complicated the Trump administration’s claims that the central bank boss had misled Congress over the scale of the renovations.New Zealand’s foreign minister, Winston Peters, has rebuked the country’s central bank governor, Anna Breman, for signinga letter of support for Powellalongside nine counterparts, including the European Central Bank’s Christine Lagarde, the Bank of England’s Andrew Bailey and Michele Bullock of the Reserve Bank of Australia.Winston Peters wrote on the social media platform X: “The RBNZ has no role, nor should it involve itself, in US domestic politics. We remind the governor to stay in her New Zealand lane and stick to domestic monetary policy. That would have been the advice of the ministry of foreign affairs and trade if the governor had sought its advice, which she did not.”Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveDonald TrumpJamie DimonJP MorganJerome PowellBankingnewsShareReuse this content"

While the specifics of theAcademy Awardnominations are never known in advance, and can always be counted on for some surprises when they’re actually unveiled, critics and pundits and fans all enter into that final stretch with a pretty good idea of who won’t be nominated.One Battle After Another and Adolescence dominate 83rd Golden GlobesRead moreSome of this is because of the endless spitballing. But the “won’t” list is also easy to compile because it ultimately houses almost everyone who acted in a movie over the past year. Twenty performances are selected for theOscarsannually, and given the other high-profile awards bodies with additional preferences, category numbers and a never-complete overlap with the Academy, let’s say about 40 are in the broader competition of real possibilities. But there are so many more great performances every year than that, across all sizes, scopes and genres.They’re not all in equally great movies, and they don’t all fit into the Academy’s collective imagination of what constitutes the best work of any given year. Even as that organization has grown a bit more adventurous, there will always be individual performances that simply didn’t have much of a chance for any number of reasons: release date, box office, critical support, genre biases and so on. But it doesn’t have to be that way! It’s possible to buck the status quo, whether it’s as an awards voter looking beyond the most-hyped contenders, or simply as a viewer looking for something interesting to watch on a Friday night. So read this rundown of the year’s overlooked-by-awards performances, then, as suggestions for last-minute consideration from Academy members – or, more likely, recommendations from looking at great acting from some different angles before settling in for the usual annual horserace.Oona Chaplin,Avatar: Fire and AshView image in fullscreenPhotograph: 20th Century Studios/APHere’s a silver lining of the Academy’s longtime resistance to the idea of nominating a motion-capture performance: just think of how impossible it will ever be for some generative AI nonsense to make it to the virtual podium! In the meantime, though, it’s a shame that the nuances of performance capture have long been consigned to the visual effects category, rather than acting. Avatar mastermindJames Cameronhas tried to emphasize this distinction in some of his promotional material for Fire and Ash, the third installment of the series, and plenty of critics have rightly pointed out that last year’s best supporting actress Zoe Saldaña gives a more fleshed-out performance in these movies, where not so much as a centimeter of her actual real-life flesh is shown on screen. Now that Saldaña has her Oscar, we can at least mix things up and advocate for Oona Chaplin, who gives an intensely physical motion-capture performance as Varang, the complicated but unhinged baddie (in both senses of the word) from Avatar: Fire and Ash. As leader of the aggressive Mangkwan clan, Varang is both menacing and weirdly seductive, depending on the kind of charisma that can’t be summoned by a mere click of the mouse. Chaplin – yes, granddaughter of the legendary Charlie Chaplin – gives Varang a distinct personality through movement alone, with her battle-ready posture, confident strut and fiery snarls. Chaplin helps create one of the most captivating (and secretly lovable) villains of the year, and even through the digital makeup, you can see she’s having a blast doing it.Kirsten Dunst, RoofmanView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Photo Credit: Davi Russo/Paramount PicturesSo many acting honorees are (somewhat understandably) spotlighted for their high-difficulty virtuosity, whether imitating a real person, conveying superhuman degrees of suffering or disguising their familiar faces with transformative makeup. InRoofman, Kirsten Dunst doesn’t do any of that. More than just about anyone on this list, she’s more or less just playing a normal person: a Toys”R”Us employee, single mom and generally nice lady who falls in love with a charming guy (Channing Tatum) who’s secretly a fugitive from prison living in the store where she works. The movie is a showcase for Tatum, yet Dunst never plays as if she’s filling a thankless love-interest role; her struggles, disappointments and small-scale joys all radiate from her face without too much exposition walking us through it. In particular, the scene where she first decides to ask Tatum out on a date is a miniature masterpiece in making multiple emotions legible while maintaining a relative placid surface. It’s some of the best, truest, least fussy acting in a big-studio movie this year.Ralph Fiennes, 28 Years LaterView image in fullscreenPhotograph: FlixPix/AlamyHe looks like a deranged butcher, covered in dried blood, and his rumor-based reputation during the first hour-plus of28 Years Latermatches up with the ominous glimpses we get of his isolated form. But when Dr Ian Kelson (Ralph Fiennes) is eventually introduced, it turns out he’s a thoughtful, soft-spoken, sensitive man –and what looks like dried blood is actually just iodine, used to repel the infected zombies roaming the English countryside where he continues to make a home. Fiennes has plenty of experience playing unhinged villains, and doubtless could have been a memorable one in Danny Boyle’s long-gap zombie sequel. What he does instead in 28 Years Later, guiding young hero Spike (Alfie Williams) through the death of his cancer-stricken mother (Jodie Comer), is far more surprising and moving. Kelson doesn’t speak much about his own backstory; he exists mostly in the movie’s here and now, whether or not building a monument to the dead – infected and not – is tenable in the long term. Fiennes does the same in his performance, using his flawless sense of gentle authority to walk the audience through a horror-movie climax about accepting death, rather than fleeing in terror.Danielle Deadwyler, The Woman in the Yard, and Tatiana Maslany, KeeperView image in fullscreenComposite: Universal Pictures/ Neon/ AlamySpeaking of horror: with Frankenstein and Sinners both in play for multiple awards categories, the genre is poised to continue its surprising resurgence at the Oscars this year. But it still often takes an all-hands-on-deck super-production to break through a horror bias, and movies like Keeper and The Woman in the Yard are too thornily small-scale to garner that kind of mass acclaim. They both feature a psychologically tortured woman at the center, confined to a limited location and haunted by forces she doesn’t entirely understand. Maslany is a woman cautiously entering her second year in a romantic relationship, holding the screen as she starts to wonder whether she’s losing her mind. Oz Perkins’ movie purposely doesn’t give her a surfeit of specific history, and Maslany stays wonderfully focused in the moment. Deadwyler, on the other hand, has plenty of backstory to contend with as a woman near-paralyzed by grief following the death of her husband. At home with her two children, she’s confronted by a ghostly, veiled figure in the front yard, and as she attempts to figure out what it’s there for, Deadwyler gives a wrenching performance of just barely getting by. In high-risk material that could easily fall into bad-taste territory, Deadwyler keeps it unflinchingly honest.Dylan O’Brien, TwinlessView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Roadside Attractions/Everett/ShutterstockMichael B Jordanis expected to receive a much-deserved Oscar nomination for clearly delineating the pair of identical twins he plays inSinners. Dylan O’Brien’s double act in Twinless isn’t nearly so balanced; one twin, Rocky, has essentially just a single sequence, and we spend the rest of the movie in close proximity to Roman, who is racked with grief over his twin’s recent death. Even if we never saw Rocky, though, O’Brien would deserve attention for his turn as the rough-edged but sweet-natured Roman, who develops a friendship with a fellow member of a support group for people who have lost their twins. O’Brien has to play plenty of qualities that it would be easy to caricature; Roman is tough, emotionally confused and not exactly quick-witted. Yet the actor never succumbs to broadness, delivering writer-director-co-star James Sweeney’s dialogue with guileless, sometimes heartbreaking charm. When we do get that brief look at Rocky, it only confirms the fullness of O’Brien’s makeup-free transformation.Keanu Reeves, Good FortuneView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Eddy Chen/LionsgateIn the nearly 40 years since Keanu Reeves ascended to stardom playing half of a duo whose combined brainpower probably amounted to one dumb teenager in Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure, he’s more than proven his stealth versatility. (His action roles alone show more range than plenty of Oscar winners.) It’s another measure of his skill that he’s able to return to a bumbling dumb-guy role in Good Fortune and spin something completely different from it. Reeves has long possessed an otherworldly quality, and he flaunts it to comic ends as Gabriel, a low-level guardian angel reaching beyond his station. In executing his thin plan help a poor guy (Aziz Ansari) realize how good he has it by switching him with a rich guy (Seth Rogen), Gabriel clearly isn’t a top-tier celestial intellect. But Reeves never loses sight of Gabriel’s puppyish desire to help; he plays him more daft than dumb, which makes the performance even funnier as he embarks on his own fish-out-of-water journey. The way he innocently asks to tag along and crash with an impoverished Rogen is somehow both adorable and hilarious; the way he describes his eventual love for those around him in his newly humanized life is emotional without turning sappy. Reeves turns Gabriel’s failure into a state of grace.Jeffrey Wright, Highest 2 LowestView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Capital Pictures/AlamyWhat are the lines between sidekick, close confidante and employee? It’s a question some wealthy folks probably don’t ask themselves often enough, and while it’s not the central question ofSpike Lee’s Highest 2 Lowest, it’s an angle on the story that’s impossible to ignore every time Jeffrey Wright is on screen. Wright’s Paul Christopher is the longtime driver for music mogul David King (Denzel Washington), as well as an ex-con; their sons are best friends, which is how Paul’s kid winds up mistakenly taken by kidnappers looking to hold David’s kid for ransom. They ransom the wrong son anyway, sending David into a dilemma that has Paul questioning his place at David’s side. Wright is often well-cast as brainy types, as in his work for Wes Anderson (he was in The Phoenician Scheme earlier this year). He’s equally effective here as a man whose livelihood depends on a wealthy friend – and maybe on the increasingly difficult task of ignoring the many millions of dollars separating the two of them.Amanda Seyfried, pretty much everythingView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Daniel McFadden/APAmanda Seyfried’s work as the title Shaker inThe Testament of Ann Leeprobably counts as one of the aforementioned 40-or-so performances in the serious awards mix. Then again, she seems to be moving toward the outskirts of this year’s contenders, without recognition from the Sag’s actor awards or the Baftas. That alone would be a shame, because Seyfried is monumental in the role. Unmoored after giving birth to four children who die before age one, her Ann Lee possesses herself with purpose, devoting her life to an offshoot of Quakerism that forbids any sexual contact, even within marriage. It also features testimony in the form of vigorous hymns and accompanying dances, where Seyfried’s lovely voice turns in something at once ecstatic and desperate.But even if Seyfried does count as fully considered in Ann Lee, she offered two other terrific performances in 2025 for good measure. In the little-seen but worthwhile drama Seven Veils, she’s an opera director grappling with past abuses and a crumbling marriage. She looks perpetually moments away from screaming in frustration, though she mostly keeps that energy bottled up, roiling behind her signature saucer eyes. And in the much-seen, very silly but highly entertaining The Housemaid, she riffs on gothic gaslighting tropes, as well as superficial suburban-mom perfection, with movie-star glee as a woman who appears to be the unhinged boss from hell. Awards are obviously for specific performances, not a full year’s CV, but Seyfried’s trio of 2025 roles complement and accentuate each other so well that any one of them is worthy of recognition.This article was amended on 14 January 2026.

A compilation of photographs taken by the artist between 1973 and 1986, the Ballad has been presented as an ever-changing slide show, with various accompanying soundtracks and voiceovers, since the 1980s.It has also been presented on video, as a film and a book. I’ve been familiar with these images for much of my adult life, watching Robin smoking, with Kenny in the background in the purple room. The smoke still hangs there beneath the mirrorball and Robin’s profile is still astonishing. I have seen Suzanne in tears and, in another shot, looking at her face in the mirror in a tiled bathroom dizzy with slanting reflections.A year later, Brian ended up beating her very badly, consumed by jealousyI have seen these picnics and beach days and the road in the hot light and the man sitting on the edge of the bed, lost in his thoughts. Goldin observes him as she squeezes the shutter (you can’t see this, but you know it is happening). The camera is on a tripod on the far side of the room, and Nan and Brian had been photographing themselves having sex, just as she’d taken pictures of her other friends doing the same. There’s some twitchy sullen feeling in the air you can’t identify. A year later, Brian ended up beating her very badly, consumed by jealousy after reading her diary.View image in fullscreenLike a beautiful corpse … French Chris on the convertible, New York City (1979).Photograph: Nan Goldin/GagosianGoldin has called the Ballad the diary she lets people read. Her Nikon camera was always to hand, so much so that people forgot about it (except when they didn’t). In this show, Goldin displays it in the form of 126 framed photographic prints, stacked four high and covering three black walls. They fill the space. The slide show originally presented up to 800 images over 45 minutes in a darkened room, accompanied by a changing soundtrack that often included Maria Callas, Petula Clark, Dionne Warwick and Dean Martin. Goldin thinks of the slideshow as a movie made with stills.Here you get lost among the prints in a different way. Their effect is cumulative and electrifying. There’s no let-up in these full-on arrays, which send the eye skittering between images, pinballing between captured moments and emotions. We go backwards and forwards in time, catching glimpses of the artist’s parents, and an old Mexican couple who seem happy enough but are a week away from their second divorce. Skinheads hanging out in a room with frightening wallpaper; Bobby masturbating; macho guys and sorrowful guys and a guy dressed as Napoleon on New Year’s Eve; someone called French Chris lying on the bonnet of a convertible, posing, his shirt open wide, like a beautiful corpse.Among the flashbacks, we encounter an empty bed in a New York brothel, wedding photos, and a cluster of photographs featuring Goldin’s black eye and bruised face, an ectopic pregnancy scar, a heart-shaped bruise. We lurch from these to tender intimacies, people dancing or having sex and lost in the moment, people alone and people coupling and uncoupling. Her titles tantalise with their brevity, just as the pictures always leave you asking: “What’s the story?” This, in part, iswhat still makes the Ballad so compelling and rewarding. Each photograph, it strikes me, leaves you on a kind of brink.View image in fullscreenPictures of innocence and experience … Warren and Jerry fighting, London (1978).Photograph: Nan Goldin/GagosianThese are pictures of innocence and experience. We begin with the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, as gruesome in the Coney Island Wax Museum as they undoubtedly were in life, and we end with a pair of skeletons screwing in a doorway, wrapped in a tender graffiti embrace. These first and last images bracket the people who move in and out of Goldin’s orbit, who shared beds and parties and holidays, tenderness and sex and silences and games of Monopoly.What strikes me now is not how louche and edgy life was for Goldin and her adoptive family of friends, but how normal their lives now seem. They don’t look lost or marginalised at all. We are now used to people posting smartphone images and videos as a kind of constantly updated and often highly self-conscious and calculated mirage of their lives. Back in the 1970s and 80s, Goldin just had a camera, and photographed on the fly. To begin with, she presented her slide shows in nightclubs and bars. Her audience were her peers.Goldin’s camera sees more than the photographer does. The apparent casualness of her approach is deceptive. The emotional texture and atmosphere of her images proves that not everyone who can hold a phone can take photographs worth looking at. When she was dancing, when she was having sex, when and wherever she was, Goldin homed in.AtGagosian, London, until 21 March.Explore more on these topicsPhotographyNan GoldinArtExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Jared Harris’s Warhol is the definitive screen Warhol (sorry, David Bowie), and Stephen Dorff’s Candy Darling absolutely shines, but it’s Taylor’s performance that holds it all together.

What does that say about men?Read moreIlya’s couch, mid-morning, post-breakfast. (The exponentially growing fandom of this six-episode show from Canadian streamer Crave, which premiered in North America in late November with virtually no promotion and has rapidly become one of themost organic TV phenomenain recent memory, knows exactly what I’m talking about.) Hollander overhears Rozanov’s distressing phone call from home and asks how his father is (he doesn’t know Russian, but agitation needs no language); Rozanov responds by wrapping a sculpted arm around his neck. The two then get intimate, in one of the show’s many near-wordless sex scenes, culminating in them each using the other’s first name for the first time.I could break down the precise, mesmeric choreography of this scene (trust that plenty already have) – the way that Hollander shifts from comforting Rozanov to pleasuring him, the slide from delicate to desirous, the specific placement of hands and eyes and thighs that will recall snippets of specific seared memory for many viewers. But suffice to say that in this scene, as throughout Heated Rivalry, sex is allowed to act as dialogue, a language unto itself between the characters for whom physical intimacy is their primary form of communication. That it works – that everyone from hockey bro podcasters to queer men toespecially womennot only understand this language but are drawn to it – is a testament to Jacob Tierney, the show’s creator, freely but faithfully adapting the romance novels by Rachel Reid, to the performances by breakout stars Williams and Storrie, to a show thattakes sex seriously. And, crucially, to Chala Hunter, the intimacy coordinator and, to quote Tierney,“absolutely the hero of this show”.I’m sure Tierney knows that’s a loaded statement. Since its formalization in the wake of the #MeToo movement, the intimacy coordinator has beenplaying defense. The job, at its most basic level, is to protect cast and crew in the production of intimate scenes, by working as a liaison between actors and directors, on everything from intimacy garments to past sexual trauma to movement choreography. Though it existed in some form, on rare productions, for years, it was encouraged (and, in some cases, mandated) following the outpouring of horror stories that upended Hollywood in the late 2010s; the position is now unionized with Sag-Aftra in the US and under Bectu in the UK, with qualifications for extensive training and paid credits.In its relatively short public life, the intimacy coordinator – as an idea or representation of values, rather than an individual professional —has traced a similar arc to the #MeToo movement generally: broad praise, with a flurry of interest on the promise of a position created, in part, as a response to trauma, burnished by revelatory examples like the highly naturalistic, sensitive sex in shows likeNormal People; practical struggles when, as with all things, ideas meet real life; conflation with ideologies far beyond an individual practitioner’s scope; backlash, with the position branded as onerous bureaucracy (often implicitly tied to DEI efforts) impeding artist autonomy.‘We’re a hot button topic’: is intimacy coordinator the most misunderstood job in film-making?Read moreSome of the opposition has been clearly rooted in misogyny. Most of it has been merely small-minded or ego-flattering – the position dismissed, downplayed or diminished based on individual experience. Mikey Madison, who won the best actress Oscar last year for playing a sex worker in Sean Baker’s Anora,declinedan intimacy coordinator because she and her scene partner “decided it would be best to just keep it small”. Jennifer Lawrence couldn’t remember if she had one while filming the psychodrama Die My Love (she did), but saidit wouldn’t have been necessarybecause her co-star, Robert Pattinson, is “not pervy” and “very in love” with his real-life partner. Lawrence’s rationale echoed that of Jennifer Aniston, who said she rejected a third party on the set of the Morning Show because co-star Jon Hamm was “such a gentleman … I’m like, ‘Please, this is awkward enough!’ We’re seasoned – we can figure this one out.” And then there’s Gwyneth Paltrow, who caused a bit ofstirby seeming, in very Gwyneth fashion, above it all; by her telling, shetoldthe intimacy coordinator on Marty Supreme to “step back” because she is from “from the era where you get naked, you get in bed, the camera’s on” and so “if someone is like, ‘OK, and then he’s going to put his hand here,’ I would feel, as an artist, very stifled by that.”One detects a chill in the air. To be clear, I have no doubt that some actors have had negative experiences with intimacy coordinators, just as I have no doubt that as job is, in and of itself, an unqualified good. In the words of Florence Pugh, the actor with, to date, the most honest and considered take on the matter, intimacy coordination is“still figuring itself out”. As with any profession, there are some people who are excellent at it, and some who are not. Pugh cited “a shit example where someone just made it so weird and so awkward and really wasn’t helpful”. But it was working with a “fantastic” coordinator when she realized, “‘Oh, this is what I’ve been missing, understanding the dance of intimacy’ as opposed to just shooting a sex scene.”View image in fullscreenConnor Storrie and Hudson Williams in Heated Rivalry.Photograph: Sphere Abacus/Sabrina Lantos © 2025That dance is, I think, the element missing from so much overblown and decontextualized “debate” over the role, and part of what makes Heated Rivalry so refreshing. So much of the focus on intimacy coordinators boils the position down to an object – a bridge between cast and crew, a bulwark against exploitation, a stopgap for miscommunications. And that is, for sure, part of the job. But it misses the potential for artistry – the breaking down of a scene, line by line, for a simulation of sex with the exactitude and ambition of a physical stunt. The collaboration with inexperienced actors to so understand the beats of an intimate scene that it allows for play. (“We really had a joyful experience as a production,” Hunter, the intimacy coordinator for Heated Rivalry, toldVulture. “It’s a gift to work with actors who surprise themselves – and surprise you.”) The intentionality that differentiates between a sex scene where, say, two rival hockey players get naked, and a chapter in a larger story about power dynamics, fantasy and the evolution of personal desire.Plenty of viewers have flocked to Heated Rivalry for the promise of sex. But in a cultural landscape where porn is ubiquitous but adult-oriented storytelling scarce, many have stayed for the narrative explorations in that sex. The sex scenes in Heated Rivalry exemplify difference between the pornographic – the mere display of sex and nudity – and the erotic, imbuing such graphic visuals with, as in real life, plot, character, idiosyncratic decisions, internal motivations. The intensity of Rozanov’s gaze and grip, as opposed to merely body meeting body. Hunter’s work as an intimacy coordinator is, at core, to safely simulate the irreducible and specific relationship between two people, the unadulterated moments of connection, in whatever shifting emotional valence, that we usually never see. That Heated Rivalry does so convincingly offers the best defense yet of the job.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionSexDramacommentShareReuse this content"

And we generally cannot go on a 100-day adventure across seven continents, with experts on hand to introduce us to their indigenous inhabitants, talk us through world-changing research being done in the most isolated regions on Earth, show us new and fascinating species that can be found there that may hold the cure to all known diseases, and guide us through the breathtaking landscapes that make you want to throw yourself to the ground and weep at the beauty laid out before humanity’s largely uncaring eyes.Not so for Willard Carroll Smith II, the Academy award, Bafta and Grammy-winning actor and rapper who enjoyed an uninterruptedly stellar career from the late 80s until 2022, when he put a crimp in things by lamping the Oscars’ host Chris Rock for insulting Smith’s wife. This was followed by a tour violinist suing him for alleged predatory behaviour, unlawful termination and retaliation, which is working its way through the California legal system now. Smith has categorically denied all allegations. He is getting away from it all in the meantime by doing all the adventuring noted above – a septet of episodes of Pole to Pole WithWill Smith(the name by which of course he is known to us) in honour of his late mentor Dr Allen Counter. Counter was a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School, the inaugural director of the university’s Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations and – in his spare time, I guess? – a noted explorer. I cannot help but feel a biopic must be in the works, and I hope it comes soon.View image in fullscreenHas all the sweeping grandeur you would expect … Will Smith takes part in a ceremony that signifies an old reef area that is closed until the fish return.Photograph: Freddie Claire/National GeographicBut back to Smith and his seven continents. The series is made by National Geographic and has all the visual polish and sweeping grandeur you would expect. It doesn’t rest on its star presenter laurels. Every moment looks gorgeous or is thrilling. The parts where Smith talks to camera are less enthralling – why does nobody ever provide a script for these things that at least attempts to match the standards reached elsewhere? – but out in the field, he’s a great companion: charismatic, funny (“They might be a little crazy,” he points out after the news that he is to visit three Brazilian climate scientists who have spent months alone in a tiny research station in west Antarctica. “And we need to be prepared for that. What’s our evacuation plan if they start tripping?”), honest in his awestruck reactions and apparently genuinely fascinated by his (genuinely fascinating) companions.View image in fullscreen‘There is not a hospital as far as I can see’ … Will Smith prepares to scale a massive, spindly tree.Photograph: Kyle Christy/National GeographicIn the three episodes available for review, they include the former Welsh rugby star and (current) polar athlete Richard Parks (who has to rein Smith in when he starts dancing on the ice sheet they are skiing across on their way to the south pole – “The environment doesn’t support life … there’s very little margin for error”), Heitor Evangelista (one of the Brazilian scientists, not “crazy”, but very clear that this is not the life for everyone) and the toxicologist Prof Bryan Fry. Fry takes Smith 60 metres (200ft) up a spindly looking tree in the Amazon rainforest to show him the spectacular view (“There is not a hospital as far as I can see,” says Smith) and then 60 metres below ground, on an expedition led by the Ecuadorian climber Carla Pérez, into caves populated by what are likely to be many new species, hidden from prying eyes and subject to unique evolutionary influences, and hoped to be the sources of new drugs and treatments for the many things that still ail us. “Give me a second,” says bug- and spider-hating Smith, as nameless little beasties skitter across the floor and up the walls, “to get my movie star face back.” In the next episode, Fry and Pérez take him anaconda-hunting. Smith hates snakes too. Attaboy.There are, inevitably, a few soul-bearing scenes but these are less godawful than they might be. Fry explains that he is motivated in part by survivor’s guilt after he emerged from a bout of meningitis “as lightly touched as you can be” (though he did have to relearn to walk because of muscle wastage, and was left permanently deaf in one ear) and Parks talks briefly and movingly about thinking “the worst thoughts” during the deepest depression he experienced after his rugby career was ended by sudden injury, and how discovering the desolate beauty of the polar regions helped him begin to recover. And Smith is an unexpectedly warm, attentive listener. It’s a lovely mix, and makes Pole to Pole a celebrity documentary that is an honourable exception to the usual dross that passes commissioning muster.Pole to Pole With Will Smith is on Disney+Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionWill SmithExplorationreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is bafflingly complacent in its sentimentality and its sheer, fatuous implausibility, which makes it valueless and meaningless as drama and comedy.Fraser plays Phillip, a hapless unemployed actor from the US who a few years previously came to Tokyo to do a goofy TV ad for toothpaste and, having no friends or family back home, simply stayed on. He lucks into a weird new source of income: working for a “rental family”, based on firms inJapanwhich really do offer bespoke therapeutic role-play services, such as errant spouses, deceased loved ones or unsatisfactory co-workers – people who can be chatted with, or mourned, or yelled at for cathartic purposes.Phillip, who has issues of his own with a father who ran out on his family when he was a kid, finds himself having to be a dad to a little girl whose single mother needs a respectable father figure for an elite private school interview; the kid is told this is the guy who disappeared when she was a baby. And he is also to be effectively a mock son to an ageing actor, whose grownup daughter fears he is depressed; she hires Phillip as a phoney interviewer tasked with writing a flattering in-depth profile.In fact, Werner Herzog has already made a film on this subject,Family Romance, LLC from 2019, in which Herzog exerted himself to acknowledge, just a little, how bizarre, dysfunctional and fundamentally irresponsible the whole business is and how likely it is to make matters worse once the imposture is discovered.Yorgos Lanthimos’s surreal satire Alpsaddressed a similar theme. I found both these films uncertain, perhaps because there is something uncomfortable about adding a layer of role play to the existing play-acting of fictional films.But this one has a serious tonal problem, wanting to turn it all into feelgood slush with some vacuous platitudes about how we are all playing roles. (Not like this we aren’t.) Phillip has to impersonate a mock groom on a phoney wedding day for a young woman who wants to hide a certain truth from her parents, and there’s supposed comedy in the twist-reveal. It’s a reactionary patriarchal society, sure, but should this woman be lying to her old mum and dad like this? And if lying is the only way forward then shouldn’t the tone be something other than quirky farce?Then there’s the little girl whose heart he is apparently willing to risk breaking by pretending to her that he is her real dad. He is finally shown explaining and apologising to her – but not to the poor older actor. There is something fundamentally wrong-headed about this smug, saccharine film.Rental Family is in Australian cinemas now, and in UK and Irish cinemas from 16 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsBrendan FraserJapanAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

McCurdy had also suffered sexual abuse, and claimed her mother had contributed to her developing an eating disorder. The memoir was a bestseller, walking readers through the realities of generational trauma; a step change for the former Disney child star who had been “the funny one” on obnoxious Nickelodeon kids’ shows.In her debut work of fiction, Half His Age, McCurdy continues to shake open a Pandora’s box, shedding light on blurred parent-child boundaries and loss of identity due to over-enmeshment, with solid one-liners that feel straight out of a sitcom writers’ room.Lead character Waldo is a high school senior whose life doesn’t seem to be her own. She play-acts through sexual encounters and disassociates at the school disco (“I stand off to the side watching, enveloped by a blanket of catatonia”). We soon find out that these reactions have been handed down from her chaotic mother. McCurdy writes the “Mom” as a comedic grand guignol, the damage she has writ on her child seeping out throughout the novel as though from invisible bullet wounds. Their relationship shifts uneasily between friends, siblings and caretaker (“I’ve been managing my mom’s emotions since I was five”). Waldo remembers Mom giving her advice on seduction when she was five (“the best way to keep a man is to be as pretty as you can be”), with tips from the tradwife school: to essentially morph into whoever your man wants you to be.McCurdy revs up to a final sex scene, which tone-shifts effortlessly from body horror to French farceWe see Waldo in scene after scene coming home to an empty house, her only company a sea of brightly coloured Post-It notes and instructions on how to reheat her next unsatisfying TV dinner. She copes via an online shopping addiction (“Tab tab tab tab. Cart cart cart cart. Desperate to chase away this heavy emptiness”) in which household items, junk food and useless fast fashion purchases become shorthand for the emotional wasteland she feels herself to be trapped in.Running on fumes, Waldo plunges headfirst into a pursuit of her married English teacher, Mr Korgy. McCurdy’s writing here is textured: Waldo’s observations are often savage but laced with humanity. Korgy is a complicated villain: a failed author turned teacher who grew up on World of Warcraft, loves Matchbox Twenty songs and is trapped in his own life. We wade about uncomfortably in the deep end of their uneven dynamic, from father-daughter to Henry Higgins and Eliza Doolittle. McCurdy writes gleefully about Waldo’s lust/disgust as she fantasises about licking his hairy paunch, and the desperate car-crash energy that buzzes between the two of them. Maybe this is a stand-in for her shopping and junk food addictions – or maybe she’s just bored.Obsession becomes tragicomic and crushingly mundane. The scenes of intimacy are a particular masterclass, McCurdy linking Waldo’s masochism with the illusion of control in the very uneven power dynamic. And when their relationship splutters in the harsh light of reality, McCurdy revs up to a final sex scene, which tone-shifts effortlessly from body horror to French farce. Half His Age is a bleak, often hilarious and uncomfortable triumph that underscores McCurdy’s talent for focusing in on the multilayered nature of trauma and artfully unpicking it, one scab at a time.Half His Age by Jennette McCurdy is published by 4th Estate (£16.99).

Kamilah Aisha Moon was due to read a poem at the ceremony, but no one had heard from her. Her phone was going straight to voicemail and staff at her hotel said she hadn’t checked in. “We’ll find her. She wouldn’t miss your wedding,” Griffiths’s sister, Melissa, assured her. But the next afternoon, in the middle of her wedding reception, Griffiths learned that Moon had died alone at home in Atlanta of unknown causes. On hearing the news she collapsed, hit her head on a table and blacked out. Paramedics pried open her eyes to shine a torch on them: “A particle of light that is so distant from the world I once knew.”For Griffiths, 47, the death of her best friend and “chosen sister” was one in a series of upheavals stretching across a decade. It began with the death of her mother, who was her greatest cheerleader and fiercest critic. She had instilled in her daughter the importance of “independence above everything. I was raised not to lose myself in the stories of others, especially men.”In 2017, Griffiths met and fell in love with Rushdie at a literary gathering, where he had collided with a plate-glass door that he thought was open, leaving him with a bloody head and a bruised ego. After that came the pandemic, during which two of Griffiths’s uncles died.But there was worse to come. Less than a year after Moon’s death, a stranger attempted to assassinate Rushdie. The author, who had a fatwa issued against him by Iran’s Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989, sustained near fatal stab wounds to his neck, chest, hand and eye. Rushdie would later write about the attack in his own book,Knife.Griffiths is a serious soul acutely attuned to the subtleties of human interactions and the chaos of her interior worldThe Flower Bearers reflects on these events and more in a narrative that hops back and forth across the decades. It is the first memoir by Griffiths, who has published five volumes of poetry and a novel, Promise. The book is simultaneously a love story, a portrait of sisterhood and a visceral depiction of violence, loss and emotional devastation. For Griffiths, the death of her friend and the attempted murder of her husband were “an uncanny Janus coin that [spun] around on the silent, bloodstained earth of my mind”.As one might expect from an author whose primary medium is poetry, the writing is evocative, full-bodied, perhaps a little overcooked in parts. Griffiths is a serious soul acutely attuned to the subtleties of human interactions and the chaos of her interior world. Though she skates over some troubling aspects of her story – there is passing mention of sexual violence and a serious suicide attempt in her early 20s – she is expansive and moving on her diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder. Griffiths’s struggles with the mental health condition led to her calling a suicide hotline in 2013. Unbeknown to her, the police were notified and dispatched to her Brooklyn apartment, where they demanded entry. Once in, they forced her to the floor and handcuffed her, ignoring her requests to walk with them to the waiting ambulance. “I hadn’t been arrested for any crime, yet my mental health episode had criminalised me,” she reflects.The Flower Bearers goes to some dark places, but there is joy, too, most notably in its portrait of Griffiths’s and Moon’s friendship, which brims with tenderness. The pair met in New York when they were graduate students studying creative writing in the mid-2000s, working multiple jobs and living hand-to-mouth. Their connection was cemented by music, poetry and the challenges of being Black women making their way in the world. Both felt “safe to share who we were, who we were becoming and what from our pasts was keeping us from claiming the promises of our futures”.In the final chapters, Griffiths embarks on a trip to the American south to honour Moon and the writers who inspired them both, and to confront the grief that threatens to overwhelm her. In doing so, she learns to accept loss as a part of living. “I know that life demands deaths, and births, each day. But it also insists on singing, dancing, suffering, surviving and loving. There is a last hour ahead of me somewhere, and it will be mine too, intimate as my first breath.”The Flower Bearers by Rachel Eliza Griffiths is published by John Murray (£22).

Each piece is a consideration of in-between states, most outlandishly the standout, Interchange, a questing solo by Seirian Griffiths. In a particularly bureaucratic purgatory, the recently deceased Michael is informed, via a brisk yet personable voiceover from Sam Booth, that he has some excess baggage to process. The only way forward is to revisit the loves of his life, from his mother to fleeting relationships.The setup, with its slightly overdone pastiche of muzak-accompanied admin hell, prompts a dance of not quite exorcism but certainly cleansing as Michael spins through his past. The occasionally galloping pace suggests the near-death notion of events flashing before your eyes, as Griffiths makes graceful yet quicksilver transitions between contained bouts of torment that are strikingly well acted and boosted by his own coiled compositions. The hip-hop stylings are featherlight, too, when he pivots with a headstand or practically levitates, his shadow like a chalked outline below.It’s audaciously done while thoughtfully considering the weight we carry, although the holding bay scenario and voiceover strangely fall away. Like Michael, the piece has some of its own unfinished business.View image in fullscreenClubbers mobilise … Archive/Flesh/Echoes by Qi Song.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianThe transitional state in Chinese choreographer Qi Song’s rave-inspired Archive/Flesh/Echoes is the small hours. Sound designer Sanki supplies an ethereal, increasingly juddering score for a corps of clubbers who mobilise after sharing whispers and touches in an informal beginning. In thrall to the DJ, drawn to the golden allure of Sanli Lin Wang’s lighting, they are not so much lost in music as fiercely concentrating on it with as much focus as another intense scene in which they separately seek sexual climax. One clubber suggests the pain of keeping up with the beats, another is sent flying by them.Whether as an undulating throng or in isolation, the dancers capture the thread of an epic night out, its momentum waxing and waning, as if a force is created between them to ride until closing time. It is done with elan, although there is some generic clubby filler in the movement and it needs tightening to sear likeThe Butterfly Who Flew Into the Rave, a not dissimilar attempt at transcendence through techno.View image in fullscreenInventive skirt-ography … Isadora D’Héloïsa in Entrecuerpos.Photograph: Jemima YongIsadora D’Héloïsa is “between bodies” in Entrecuerpos and also between flamenco and voguing, styles she finds akin in their background of “marginalised histories and resistance”. Performing her own choreography – accompanied by Bryan Reyes (guitar), Ago Hernandez (percussion) and Carlos de Luisa (cante) – she moves from flamenco’s tempestuous footwork and yearning to the voguing crouch of a duck walk and general runway pizzazz.D’Héloïsa finds a commonality, including framings of the arms, though she more successfully isolates hands than legs, while the flamenco percussion accentuates the voguing angularity. The fusion never quite becomes more than the sum of its parts, but its joys include some inventive skirt-ography, her ruffles transforming into cape and camouflage for a piece alternating between sheer fabulousness and inner conflict.Resolution festival is atthe Place, London, until 25 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsDanceTheatreDance musicClubbingFlamencoreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now, like the proverbial London buses, here comes the same piece again (though this time calling itself The Makropulos Affair rather than the Royal Opera’s The Makropulos Case), with Simon Rattle leading two concert performances at the Barbican Hall.Rattle’s first-night account was simply sensational. He plunged at almost manic speed into Makropulos’s compellingly exciting prelude, and barely let up for the best part of two hours, as the opera played without an interval. The fierce tension may occasionally have come at the expense of some of the lighter touches that beguiled in Hrůša’s approach. Yet Janáček’s extraordinarily deft ear for orchestral detail and harmony – like the bassoon solo announcing the central character’s first appearance – was never sacrificed. The LSO played thrillingly.View image in fullscreen(l to r):Doubravka Novotná (Krista),  Marlis Petersen (Emilia Marty), Sir Simon Rattle, Aleš Briscein (Albert Gregor) and Svatopluk Sem (Baron Jaroslav Prus) with Simon Rattle and the London Symphony Orchestra in a concert performance of the Makropulos Affair.Photograph: Mark AllanTo succeed, this opera requires a commanding performance of the central role of the alchemically young diva Emilia Marty, originally born as Elina Makropulos in 1585. It got that from the German soprano Marlis Petersen. Marty is not an instantly sympathetic character, but Petersen found the emotional intelligence and vocal grandeur to make her final act transformation truly uplifting. Janáček’s writing for Marty is often cruelly exposed, but Petersen rose to every challenge. It was a performance fit to be bracketed with the most memorable Martys.It also helped that all the many minor characters were so sharply drawn. Having several of these roles taken by native Czechs brought instant authenticity and nice contrasts. If Aleš Briscein’s Albert Gregor and Vit Nosek’s Janek stood out, Jan Martiník’s Kolenaty, Svatopluk Sem’s Baron Prus and Doubravka Novotná’s Krista were in no way eclipsed. Peter Hoare was a lively Vitek, while Alan Oke effortlessly stole his scenes as the elderly Count Hauk-Šendorf.Tellingly, this concert version of Makropulos was able to pack more emotional impact and dramatic coherence thanKatie Mitchell’s scattergun stage productionin November. The story of a woman who has lived for 337 years, and finally embraces death rather than eternal life, emerged under Rattle as what Janáček surely thought it was: an intense and humane renunciation of the unattainable and tragic. A century on from the premiere in Brno, a work that was written in the shadow of first world war slaughter now felt frighteningly relevant to an era in which crazed autocrats such as Putin and megalomaniacs like Musk are seriously craving a version of the Makropulos alchemy to achieve their own immortality.Performance repeated atthe Barbican, London, on 15 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsLondon Symphony OrchestraClassical musicSimon RattlereviewsShareReuse this content"

If I could speak to him I’d say: “Come back, because I can’t really bear being without you.”We saw each other or spoke every day since 1980. I was a third party in the marriage, but Rima was never jealous. When we met for the first time, he let me stay at his house. He was in bed and I just jumped up and down on his body with excitement, but it wasn’t sexual. Then we both got into the RSC and rented a house together we called Shakespeare Sauna.View image in fullscreen‘I just jumped up and down on his body with excitement’ … Wax and Rickman in 2009.Photograph: Nick Harvey/WireImageWe had a pet tortoise, Betty, who I got into every RSC show, which made Alan scream. We’d dress her up – that’s the kind of sense of humour he had. But then I made her ride a bicycle, and had her walk across Gower Street, and got reported to the RSPCA, who took her away.There isn’t a day that goes by when I don’t see something he would find hilarious. I did everything for Alan; if I could make him laugh that was like winning an Oscar. He steered my career for the first 30 years and I think I’d be doing much better now if he was still around. I don’t have anybody like that I can trust.Nobody was a better critic of your acting. He was a genius who could see into the heart of a performance and know instinctively what about the person was getting in the way. He could see your ego and wanted to edit it. Some people couldn’t take it because he could do it with cruelty – he was intolerant if people weren’t listening. But he was always right.He used to tell me to not look desperate when I was doing comedy and tell me I was smiling as if I wanted everyone to love me. When he directed my shows he’d do my comedy for me in the right way and clean the floor. He wasn’t gay, but he delivered lines in high, high camp. And then I’d sort of sadly imitate him.It was such a deep connection. He wanted to take care of me and would defend me against my parents who were vicious. He’d tell them I had talent, which they didn’t believe, but they listened to him and they let me continue. Each time I’d get off the plane from visiting them in Chicago I’d perform for Alan what they’d said and done to me. He would bend over laughing. That was the only time he didn’t give me notes. He’d just say it was brilliant.View image in fullscreen‘My children are bereft’ … Alan Rickman and Ruby Wax admiring their names outside the Royal Shakespeare Company 1978.Photograph: Courtesy of Ruby WaxAlan was godfather to my children and they’re bereft, because he steered them too. At school, my daughter Maddie was really shy, hardly spoke. In plays, she’d be in the back, playing a leaf. Alan told her: “You have to go to clown school.” At the time I thought: why is he doing this to me? But now, she’s a comedian. He opened her up like a can. He would’ve been so proud that my daughters are comedians but he would have given them endless notes.It was such a privilege to have known him for so long, back when he was raw, before he was famous. I could see the gold when he was just doing Shakespeare. I wish he wasn’t only remembered by kids for being Snape. I’d begged him to do films, but he kept turning them down, saying he’d be stereotyped. And, lo and behold, he ended up a stereotype for a lot of people.Nowadays, I see people trying to imitate him, but they can’t pull it off. Nobody gets close to Alan. There are people who are ethereal or male or female or a certain age or a certain type. He was something totally unique. Alan was unreal.‘There was always dinner’Lindsay DuncanDeath often feels like an aberration. In Alan’s case, it was a hell of an aberration. Surely he wouldn’t allow it? Of course, even he couldn’t control this one, or could he? Famously, he chose every detail of his funeral. Of course he did. Was it good? You bet it was. He wouldn’t have died until it was perfect.View image in fullscreen‘He could be imperious’ … (from left): James Earl Jones, Lynn Redgrave, Lindsay Duncan and Alan Rickman in New York in 1987 when Les Liaisons Dangereuses was on Broadway.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveAlan loved a good time. He loved making a good time for other people. His dressing rooms were always a party. There were politicians, movie stars, old friends, new friends and plenty of wine, elegantly poured by Alan. Then there was dinner. Always dinner. If anyone looked as though they might be going home alone, they were scooped up and nervous maître d’s learned that the huge cachet of havingAlan Rickmanin their restaurant was accompanied by a hasty adjustment to the size of the table.Fame really suited Alan. He joyfully shared all the upsides with his friends. Those many dinners were paid for by him and objections were met with a little smile and “I’ve got two words to say to you: Harry. Potter”. He could be imperious. He could be cross. Once, at a cast dinner, he got into a political row and called his understudy a Tory cunt. The next day, barely controlling his face, he just said: “Oops …” He did apologise.View image in fullscreen‘Magnificent’ … Lindsay Duncan and Alan Rickman in Private Lives in London, 2001.Photograph: Robbie Jack/Corbis/Getty ImagesListen to Alan performing Revolutionary Witness, and Tom Waits’s Take It With Me and Uptown Funk – again. Some of his funeral soundtrack. Think, cry, laugh and party. That’s Alan. A magnificent man.‘It was one of the worst nights of his life’Richard CurtisIt’s a pretty open secret that when three of us had the final vote for who should play the lead in Four Weddings and a Funeral, I was out-voted. I wanted Alan Rickman. Hugh Grant got the part. My reasoning was that Hugh was a bit too handsome and annoying, but mainly I voted for Alan because I’d so loved him in a film called Close My Eyes. In the years that followed Four Weddings, with each new film Alan did, from Sense and Sensibility to An Awfully Big Adventure to Galaxy Quest, I kept seeing reasons why I might have been right. He had such a wonderful softness and depth next to his stern, scarier side. And a great sense of comedy.But I did also always think he was a bit out of my league, so it was such a thrill when he agreed to be in Love Actually 10 years later. I thought he was wonderful in the film, and a huge part of the power of Emma Thompson weeping to Joni Mitchell in the bedroom is because Alan has been so believable; a million miles from the cliched cad the character could have been. He’s extraordinary in the scene where Emma faces him with what he’s done. He made it easy for me during the filming – it was my first film as director – and I was surprised by how friendly he was, and unsurprised by how pitch-perfect his performance was.View image in fullscreen‘I’ll never forget Alan’s agony’ … Rowan Atkinson and Alan Rickman in Love Actually.Photograph: Ronald GrantI’m sure Alan wouldn’t mind me talking about the only tricky night we had. It was the scene where Rowan Atkinson is wrapping a present for him in a department store, very slowly. First we shot Alan, who did his work swiftly and exquisitely. Then we turned the camera on Rowan. Rowan, being a close friend of mine and having about 10 different stages to remember, took his time, often stopped and chatted with me in the middle of takes, us keeping the camera running while he worked out what to do with rosebuds and sticks of lavender, breaking out of character, practising. I’ll never forget Alan’s agony as, total professional that he was, he kept up his supportive and nervous performance for 12 minute takes, never dropping out of character for a moment as we chatted and dithered. He described it as one of the worst nights of his life.It is heart-breaking how many wonderful years and wonderful performances of his we’ve missed.‘We gobbled blueberry pie and cheered each other on’Sigourney WeaverTen years … it seems so much longer. An eternity since we last heard Alan’s gorgeous laugh boom out. I first saw him in Les Liaisons Dangereuses on Broadway; so convincing in his wickedness I assumed it was the real him … yes, and I’m an actor.View image in fullscreen‘Our stomachs ached with laughter’ … Rickman and Weaver in Galaxy Quest (1999).Photograph: Dreamworks Skg/AllstarYears later we met for real on the film Galaxy Quest. Here was this sublimely playful man who surrendered utterly to portraying a washed up TV hack, seething with petty jealousy and clawing at his giant shell-cap. His character grounded us all. Tim Allen made us laugh so hard all day long, and no one more so than Alan. Our stomachs ached at the end of every day.Shortly afterwards, Alan asked me to do Snow Cake with him: a romantic lead for him and for me the challenge of playing an autistic woman called Linda. I was so astonished that he could imagine me as Linda, I researched it for a full year so I wouldn’t let him down. We shot it way up in Wawa, Canada, gobbling blueberry pie and cheering each other on. When Linda would veer out of her lane, Alan would say firmly: “I do not improvise.”View image in fullscreen‘I do not improvise’ … director Marc Evans, Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman at the Edinburgh premiere of Snow Cake, 2006.Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The GuardianI made the idiot mistake of thinking this brilliant friend would be with us for ever. At Mike Nichols’ memorial in November 2015, he came up to me with his wife, Rima. I threw my arms around him and said: “Hey, we’re going to do another Galaxy Quest!” He looked at me quietly and said: “We’ll see.” I said: “What do you mean? It’s gonna be so much fun.” He squeezed my shoulders, looked down and said very gently: “We’ll see.” He was gone two months later, for ever to be missed.‘There was nothing flaky about him. No nonsense, no rubbish’Brian CoxI can’t believe it’s been 10 years since we lost Alan. His death was such a shock. My father died of pancreatic cancer when I was eight – and my first wife’s father also died of the same disease. With Alan, I first felt guilty, because we hadn’t been in touch for a while. And then I wondered: what’s going to happen? How will the world be now Alan’s gone? Because he had this way of making people feel easy. He could take their cares away. It was an incredible gift.‘He looked laid-back but he was very driven’ … Rickman and Brian Cox in Thérèse Raquin.I worked with Alan on his first TV show: Thérèse Raquin in 1980. He immediately had a solidity and clarity about him, as well that amazing gravity and integrity. He’d started as a graphic artist, which had left him with a very fine visual sense, and also a real discipline. His standards were very high. Alan might have appeared laid-back but he was endlessly driven, very firm, totally reliable. There was nothing flaky about him. No nonsense. No rubbish.Everyone knew he was an extraordinary actor, but as we became friends, I realised what an extraordinary person he was, too. I had such respect for Alan. So many people relied on him. He was so kind and supportive to those who were struggling: he’d seek them out and sort them out. Listen to problems without presumption and gently come up with solutions.He had an incredible generosity of spirit, as well as a commitment to serving his community and being present in people’s lives. His death made me conscious of the need to keep in touch with people and see them often. A presence such as his is missed for a long time. I still occasionally think: oh, I’d like to talk to Alan about this. Then I remember he’s not here any more. I loved his acting, but as a man I loved him even more.‘I nearly broke his back’Sharleen SpiteriWhen we planned the video for Texas’s In Demand in 2000, the director had the idea I would dance the tango with someone. I said I didn’t want it to be with some random gorgeous man because that’d just be soulless – it needed to be someone you thought would dance the tango. Then [composer] Michael Kamen walked in and said he was just off the phone with Alan Rickman, who was a big fan of Texas. Everybody looked at each other and went: “Now there’s somebody that would dance the tango.” Alan agreed, and even cancelled the first week of his annual holiday in Italy to do it.We shot the video overnight and it was so, so cold. Most of the shoot was driving around in a Bentley but then we did the tango in a petrol station about 5am. I was in this backless Valentino dress and high heels, freezing my bollocks off. Alan was in a suit. The crew had giant puffer coats. At one point the director shouted: “Shar! Throw him against the petrol pump like you’re about to fuck his brains out!” I did. Then about two seconds after the bit that’s in the video, he slid very slowly back down the petrol pump. I’d got so excited I nearly broke his back.‘Throw him against the petrol pump like you’re about to fuck his brains out!’ … the video for In Demand.Fifteen years later, Texas had a song, Start a Family, I thought would make a good duet. I phoned Alan and said: “How do you fancy singing on a record?” And he went: “Oh, good God …” in that wonderful drawling voice of his. In the end, most of it was more speaking than singing, but he did break into a little bit of melody in places. It was great watching him interpret the music. And we had an absolute laugh filming the video: putting on our very serious faces, then giggling between takes.He was so naughty and mischievous and always had a serious glint in his eye. We had the best time together. But I really loved that he – like me – also took the work very seriously. It wasn’t about being famous or where you’re seen or who you’re seen with. It was about being privileged enough to be doing the thing you’d dreamed of, with creative people.He was so generous with his time and love and friendship, and always very giving with people who were just coming up: exchanging contacts and connecting people and giving them chances. I loved it because I met so many people through him. I’ve never been so close to someone so famous.‘ I think he’s still at the end of the phone’ … the video for Start a Family.Whenever he’d ring me on speakerphone in my car and someone else was with me their eyes would nearly pop out of their head. That amazing voice! The depth and richness and enunciation. I remember my daughter and her friends being in the car when they were about seven and had just got intoHarry Potter. When Alan rang they lost their minds: “Oh my God! It’s Snape!”There’s a part of my mind in which I think he’s still at the end of the phone. He was on TV all over Christmas; I’d have it on in the background and suddenly I’d hear his voice. That bit of him stays alive. It was a really lovely and warm and comforting feeling. At the supermarket last week, a stranger hugged me and said: “You danced with Alan Rickman! You’re the luckiest woman on the planet!” I was like: you know what? I am pretty damn lucky.‘He might be alarmed at today’s tyranny’Ian RicksonView image in fullscreen‘I remember him it emboldens me to fight for what I believe in’ … Ian Rickson in 2021.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianAlan was unafraid to express his radical political perspective. And he was unashamedly a believer in the arts.In holding both of these two positions he also articulated the interdependence of culture and meaning. He embraced his craft, and particularly the role of theatre as a political medium.He might be alarmed at how much more tyranny and inequality there is now, and also how much harder people feel it is to speak out about it. And with his working-class origins I know he’d worry about the increasing elitism in the business.So when I remember him it emboldens me to fight for what I believe in, and relish the privilege I have in getting to make theatre.‘Praise from Alan counted far more than a critic’s review’Harriet WalterAlan was never a nobody. Even when he was an unknown 32-year-old, when I first met him in the bar at the old Bush theatre, he seemed like somebody. “Oh, I’ve heard aboutyou,” he drawled in that beautiful voice. His searchlight gaze had fallen on me and for that moment he mademefeel like somebody.The first play I did with him was The Seagull at the Royal Court. I didn’t have to act Nina’s fascination with Trigorin. We also did a restoration comedy together. He was brilliantly funny both on and off stage. I don’t think he was easy to direct. He was too much of a director himself. You wanted to do your best for him. Praise from Alan, even then, counted far more than any critic’s review.View image in fullscreen‘I didn’t have to act Nina’s fascination with Trigorin’ … Harriet Walter and Alan Rickman in The Seagull.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyI remember a phone call with him around that time, gossiping about any jobs we had been offered. I had plumped gratefully for the first thing that came my way, while Alan recited a list of roles he had turned down. He was paring down his choices with what I soon learned was an acute sense of where he was heading and where he was supposed to be. If this sounds offensive, it wasn’t. He was a rocket that was perfectly prepared but hadn’t yet been launched. When the part of Obadiah Slope in Barchester Chronicles came his way he recognised his moment and he pounced.Then there was Les Liaisons Dangereuses and then there was Die Hard playing Bruce Willis’s nemesis. Wow! My old mate Alan had become a film star – a fully fledged Somebody – and he took to that status as the proverbial duck to water.His generosity and kindness were legendary as was his brilliant sense of humour – a unique combination of wry sophistication and silliness that is evident in many of his film roles. When I worked with him again in Sense and Sensibility, although our characters didn’t meet we spent plenty of social time on location.Alan took care of me, made sure I dined with him and the top cast at the top tier hotel restaurant and paid for the cab back to my not quite top tier hotel some 10 miles away. He threw a birthday party for me in the year my partner died from cancer. He knew it would be a hard one for me.View image in fullscreen‘I am almost happy for him that he left when he did’ … Richard Wilson, Alan Rickman, Harriet Walter and Emma Fielding at a Royal Court gala, 2009.Photograph: Alan DavidsonAlan elevated friendship to an art form. His friends grew in number throughout his extraordinary career but he never dropped his old pals in favour of more starry ones. He was unusually loyal. I marvelled at how he managed to see nearly all of our performances and wine and dine us afterwards. Stardom didn’t change him because he had always been a star, albeit a very well-grounded one.So much has happened in the world in the 10 years since he died. I miss his piercing intelligence now more than ever. It is terribly sad for all of us that he has gone but I am almost happy for him that he left when he did.‘He queued for breakfast in his Snape costume and wig’Tom FeltonWhen I think about Alan a smile always comes to my face. I was lucky enough to work with him for 11 years at Leavesden studios on Harry Potter.I remember how intimidated I was when I first saw him. Not because of his portrayal of the seemingly evil Professor Snape but because he was the only cast member I actually recognised.View image in fullscreen‘He turned slowly to me and said: ‘I’ve peaked’’ … Tom Felton with Rickman as Snape in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyAs an 11-year-old, I had no idea who Sir Richard Harris or Dame Maggie Smith were, but Alan was big time! Seeing the man who’d played that brilliantly villainous role as the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves seated at the end of the Headteacher’s table in Hogwarts’ Great Hall was very memorable.He was nothing but kind, genuine, seemingly unfazed by anything happening around us and always had time for everyone. I learned just as much – if not more – from Alan off-camera as I did when we were filming.He could have had his food delivered to his trailer, like most of the cast (including me). Instead, he queued up for his own breakfast and lunch, head to toe in his Snape costume and wig, holding a plastic tray and waiting his turn in the usually very long line behind a carpenter, set decorator, burly cameraman and Gringotts goblin – an image I will never forget. I didn’t realise it then, but I think now Alan’s silent message was: “We’re all in this together. Equally.”I remember the night shoot when Hagrid’s hut was set on fire. It was about 4am and freezing cold. We stood together on a grassy bank, Helena Bonham Carter and Robbie Coltrane battling behind us. Alan didn’t utter a word. I finally mustered the courage to ask him: “You all right, Alan? How you feeling?” About 10 seconds after I’d spoken he turned his head to me and replied slowly: “I’ve peaked.” He then turned his head back with the tiniest hint of a smile and a twinkle in his eye.View image in fullscreen‘If children visited, he’d sneer and tell them to tuck their shirt in’ … Rickman as Snape.Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarHe taught me a great deal about charity. He would often have half a dozen people visit the studio each day, and would claim they were his cousins or friends. Really, he was offering terminally ill children and their families a chance to see behind the curtains. He also taught me that children don’t want to meet actors, but the characters they play.I would usually greet a nine-year-old visitor by saying: “Hello, how’s it going mate?” which would usually freak them out: “Why is Draco being so happy?!” Alan would sneer at them in front of their parents, then tell them to tuck their shirts in and clip them round the ear. Full Snape. Charming, disarming and a delight to watch. He never smiled. But when I look back, I think he probably was inside.‘He kind of loved you – in a way that wasn’t creepy’Anna ChancellorI must have met Alan before I became his employee, but he wasn’t my friend. So when he cast me in Creditors, which he directed, I was amazed and incredibly flattered because anyone would have worked for Alan.It was a golden time: just the three of us in the cast – me, Tom Burke and Owen Teale. Alan hardly ever directed so he didn’t have the weariness of a lot of jobbing directors. He was very inspired and wanted to translate what had and hadn’t worked for him as an actor to us. He’d start by asking you for any ideas you had about the play, your part, anyone else’s part, the costumes, and write them down in his very beautiful handwriting. No thought was unnecessary or wrong. And that doesn’t sound very radical, but actually it’s not common.View image in fullscreen‘His care was a turning point for me’ … Tom Burke, Alan Rickman, Anna Chancellor and Owen Teale at the press night for Creditors, 2008.Photograph: Dan Wooller/ShutterstockMost directors aren’t actors. And Alan felt so personally about things that had gone well, and very deeply about things that hadn’t. He was very sensitive about times he’d felt sort of shamed. So he kept saying to us three: “You are all just perfect.”He was also a hard taskmaster. He clearly understood that there are rules and mechanics and techniques, which he’d thought very deeply about. For instance: you shouldn’t start one sentence on the same pitch as you finished the one before. He knew his own failings as an actor; that sometimes his voice could be ponderous and drop at the end. He didn’t want you to do that.What he hated most of all was if you indicated to an audience what you were thinking before you thought it, with ums and oohs and ahhs. He called them “trampolines”. He didn’t want you trampolining; he wanted you to come inbang, snap, sharpwith clarity of thought.He once lined us all up and said: “Anna, this is what you do,” and ran his hands through his hair. “That is your habit. And when you bend down you sort of stick your arse in the air. Don’t do that.” I think a lot of directors wouldn’t say that to you; they might feel it was stepping a bit beyond their remit.He was stricter with the guys. As an actress, I felt so seen by him and so appreciated. His care was a turning point for me. I just adored him. He kind of loved you, in a way that wasn’t creepy. He was very interested in you and very clear about what you and only you could bring. He made you feel like you had what no one else had.The play transferred from the Donmar to New York, where it was much better received. Alan was there every night and after the show he would open the dressing room door and in would walk Al Pacino or Liam Neeson or Susan Sarandon. It was a dream. I’ve known people with money but I’ve never known anyone pick up a bill like Alan. He was the most generous person I’ve ever met. If your friend was in town, he’d pay for their ticket and then book you into one of Keith McNally’s fabulous restaurants.One day I woke with the most unbelievable headache. I couldn’t see. I rang Alan and he said to come over. When I got to his flat I was sick everywhere. We went to hospital and Alan sat with me as they went through all my medical history, so it became a different sort of relationship.View image in fullscreen‘As soon as I got to Alan’s fabulous flat I was sick everywhere’ … Tom Burke and Anna Chancellor in Creditors.Photograph: Robbie Jack/Corbis/Getty ImagesIn order to test for viral meningitis – which is what I had – I had a lumbar puncture, which leaked, so Alan and I went to a special clinic where they take blood from your arm and they put it back into your body and it forms a plaster over the hole. The doctor told us that I should avoid sudden, loud movements in case the blood clot dislodge.I said: “Oh, really? Because, Alan, what about when I really scream at the end of the play?” And he went: “Don’t worry, we can just come back and get another plaster.” That’s what you sign up for as an actor: if you’re unwell, you still go on.I went to see Alan a lot when he was in hospital, but still as my mentor, not my friend. Then, in 2024, I went to Mexico for the day of the dead to scatter the ashes ofmy daughter, Poppy, and randomly met Ruby Wax on the plane. I said she should print out a picture of Alan, and we made an impromptu shrine in one of these huge, beautiful cemeteries in Oaxaca. We lit candles and we told stories and it was very moving. Alan would have loved it.‘I could not reconcile myself to his absence’Helena Kennedy KCView image in fullscreen‘His death was such a theft’ … Helena Kennedy KC in 2019.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianTen years ago; it does not seem possible. His death was such a theft from us; this brilliant, gorgeous actor, who had so much more to give, was suddenly gone. Although I was one of the close friends who was privy to Alan’s illness and visited him as he faded, I could not reconcile myself to his absence.Alan was undoubtedly one of Britain’s greatest actors. His distinctive languid voice and his sublime ability to embody the characters he played made him truly exceptional. So many of his stage and film performances were breathtaking. My good fortune was that I also knew his other attributes, as a keen fighter for the good of the world, with a strong sense of injustice. It was no surprise that Alan with Katharine Viner created the very moving playMy Name is Rachel Corrie, about the young American activist who was killed while peacefully opposing house demolitions in Gaza, or that his last film, Eye in the Sky, was about the moral responsibility governments bear regarding their use of drones.Alan was such a vivid presence in my life and played such an important role in so many of our family events – the dinners where he insisted that Harry Potter was paying; the fundraisers for my husband’s medical research foundation; Saving Faces; the thrill for my children of knowing the Sheriff of Nottingham and then Severus Snape! We relished the holiday where he and his wife, Rima, joined us in Cape Cod and were beach bums like the rest of us.View image in fullscreen‘A keen fighter for the good of the world’ … Megan Dodds in My Name is Rachel Corrie, 2005.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianWhat countless people in the arts and beyond will remember about Alan was his kindness, his fostering of the talents of others, his financial aid to those who needed help. He was generous of his time, of his heart, and of his encouragement. He was a giant in his profession and a prince among men.‘I was fascinated by his subtle, attractive air of melancholy’Heike MakatschView image in fullscreen‘He sent a bouquet of flowers with a note saying how much he had appreciated his mistress’ … Heike Makatsch and Alan Rickman in Love Actually.Photograph: Moviestore/REX/ShutterstockEven though it feels a lifetime ago, I still remember vividly the few days of filming I was lucky enough to share with Alan on Love Actually. I felt a little out of place, and at times shy, surrounded by such well-known, top-of-the-list actors whose warm and layered performances I had long admired from afar.To this day, I remain grateful for the generosity with which Alan made me feel welcome on set, always stepping in with quiet support whenever nerves threatened to get the better of me. He was gentle, witty, helpful, and wonderfully modest, appearing during shooting breaks with instant coffee and biscuits, only to impress me moments later with his acting skills and perfectly timed double-takes. I was fascinated by the subtle, attractive air of melancholy that seemed to follow him everywhere.And when filming Love Actually came to an end, he sent a bouquet of flowers to my doorstep, with a note saying how much he had appreciated his mistress, Mia. I was really chuffed. Looking back, I wish I had allowed myself to enjoy his company more, instead of placing him on a pedestal he never chose to stand on.‘Alan told Jimmy Kimmel: “No, it’s more of a dick flick”’Stephen ReaElegant, stylish, sophisticated. A glorious actor. Tremendously perceptive about performance. When he saw a show he could give notes that only a great actor would have observed. In a warm and generous manner.He lived up to the original identity of his name – Rickman – princely, regal. And he was famed for his wit. Interviewed by Jimmy Kimmel: “So this is a chick flick?” Alan replied: “No, it’s more of a dick flick.”‘Tremendously perceptive’ … Rickman in Michael Collins.And when he received an award for his performance as the Sheriff of Nottingham, he remarked that every time he looked at it he would realise “subtlety isn’t everything”. Hilarious. Classy. Forever missed.‘That a man so incredible chose to stay in touch made me feel special’Kevin SmithIn 1997, Alan got in touch to say he’d really liked Chasing Amy and to ask what we were doing next. So I got to work with a man whose work I’d always appreciated so much that if it wasn’t released in the US, I’d seek it out in specialist video stores.One day on Dogma, I saw him and Jason Mewes sitting on the church steps together, deeply engaged in conversation. I remember thinking: “What the fuck could these two possibly have to say to one another?” I sidled up to Alan later and said: “If Jason is bothering you, please let me know.” He said: “Jason Mewes could never bother me. He’s an American icon and an absolute true original.” It was beautiful to hear him say that.View image in fullscreen‘Kevin, it’s Alan, you’re taking me to lunch’ …Alanis Morissette, Alan Rickman and Kevin Smith on the set of Dogma.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockAfter the movie, we stayed in touch. Whenever I was in the UK, I’d get a call saying: “Kevin, it’s Alan. You’re in my country. I’m taking you to lunch.” And the same thing when he was in the US: “Kevin, it’s Alan. I’m in your country. You’re taking me to lunch.”When I played the O2, Alan and Rima came to the show and then drove back into town with me and my wife, Jen. Alan said he’d finally cracked and got an apartment in New York. I said: “That sounds great!” He said: “Maybe not, because it’s in the same building as my friend.” I said: “Even better!” He said: “Well, my friend is Ralph Fiennes, and if Harry Potter fans ever find out Voldemort and Snape live in the same building, they’ll burn it down.”After the Empire film awards one night, we all went out together with Matt Damon and his wife, Luciana. We had dinner and then about 1am took a picture together on London Bridge. I still have it on my laptop. It was a blissful time.I always thought Alan was nice and courteous and political. But after he died, it occurred to me he wasn’t just being professionally polite or British. He went out of his way to maintain a friendship. If he’d wanted, he never would have had to interact with me again. That a man as incredible as Alan chose to do so made me feel special. Very rarely do you meet somebody that exceptional. That guy, for whatever reason, liked me! I carry that as a badge of honour.‘He paid for the whole wrap party’Randall Millerand Jody SavinWe did not know Alan, but we knew he would be exquisite as the lead in our 2007 film, Nobel Son, about an egocentric professor whose son is kidnapped. So we made an offer to his US and UK agents. But when the Americans rejected our scale offer [for minimum pay], we thought that was the end of it. Two weeks later, we arrived home to a message on our answering machine from Alan himself. His UK agents had passed the script on to him, and he had read it.View image in fullscreen‘It was the best telephone message of our careers’ … Rickman at the Hollywood premiere of Nobel Son in 2008.Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/Reuters“Thank you for being real writers,” he said. It was the best telephone message of our careers. He thanked us for offering him the part but feared he had scheduling conflicts. So we overhauled our shooting schedule to make it work. And he was, of course, brilliant: always that actor who raised everyone’s game and challenged us all to be the best we could be.At the conclusion of the shoot, he asked about the wrap party. When we confessed we were completely out of funds, he wrote a cheque and paid for it himself. That was Alan – generous, inclusive and fun.We went on to make two more films with Alan: Bottle Shock in 2008 and CBGB in 2013. We shot Bottle Shock in Napa in the height of summer and Alan was stuffed into a three-piece wool suit and driving a tiny Gremlin with no air conditioning. He never complained. In the scene, the car gets a flat tyre. He gets out and yells “Knickers!” and kicks the wheel. But then he inadvertently slipped and did a Charlie Brown fall on his rump. Still in character, he popped right up and got on with the scene. The accident made the scene sing.View image in fullscreenRickman in Bottle Shock.Photograph: Freestyle Releasing/AllstarAlan was ill during the making of CBGB, but we never knew. He was our muse, a great friend and an exacting collaborator. He made us all better. He lives on in our hearts and films, and we miss him dearly.‘Alan became this ghost that had haunted my childhood’Neil JordanPeople said I wanted to cement Éamon de Valera’s status as a villain and so I cast the villain from Die Hard. I didn’t. I cast Alan Rickman in Michael Collins because he was one of the best actors of his generation. He was also tall, rather gaunt, had a prominent nose and looked remarkably like the taoiseach, Uachtarán, (President, Il Duce, Caudillo choose your translation) that seemed to dominate Irish life from the 1920s onward.View image in fullscreen‘Alan’s nose seemed to have expanded itself in imitation’ … Rickman in Michael Collins.Photograph: Maximum Film/AlamyBut nothing could have prepared me for my first encounter with Alan as De Valera, in a trailer (he had his own, rather small) behind the set of O’Connell Street we had built on the grounds of a disused institution. The General Post Office from which he would emerge in the film, bruised and battered but unbowed, was one 10th smaller than the original. He was listening to tapes of that voice I remembered from my childhood which every múinteoir (teacher) I ever had seemed to imitate. He was dressed in a long gaberdine coat with one of those high necked strangulation collars, the pair of wire-rimmed glasses that seemed to never leave the prominent bump on De Valera’s nose. Alan’s nose seemed to have expanded itself in imitation. He was clutching a copy of the actual Anglo-Irish Treaty which he was about to denunciate, in De Valera’s actual words. And there were 5,000 extras, waiting below for his entrance.Alan thought at the time I had arranged things this way to force the performance from him. I hadn’t. The schedule was so tight, the huge extras calls so complicated, it had to be that way. But I saw him walk out, mount the wooden podium behind the huge Irish flag and become this ghost that had haunted my childhood.“The volunteers would have to wade through Irish blood, through the blood of the soldiers of the Irish government and through, perhaps, the blood of some members of this government in order to get Irish freedom.”It was chilling. The wind whipped the enormous flag behind him. Five thousand people below, in cloth caps and borrowed shawls, roared in agreement. A civil war was the only answer.View image in fullscreen‘I began imagining a sequel’ … Rickman in the film with Liam Neeson and Aidan Quinn.Photograph: Maximum Film/AlamyThe voice, high and wheedling, was note perfect. I began imagining a sequel, that moment, on this extraordinary, contradictory figure. Alan Rickman head to head with Winston Churchill, who described these encounters as “trying to pick up mercury with a fork”. But historical epics don’t get sequels. De Valera, unlike Michael Collins, wouldn’t be sanctified by an early death. He would be burdened with guiding this republic, with all of its contradictions and failings, into the future.But Alan could have made every detail worth it.‘In hospital he wanted laughter and gossip’Frances BarberWhat can I say that everyone else that knew him hasn’t already eulogised? The most loving, generous man in the world, with such charm he made everyone weak at the knees. Such wit, such a sense of humour and kindness that surpassed anything I had ever witnessed before.View image in fullscreen‘He came to everything I ever did … with quite a lot of pithy notes after the shows’ … Frances Barber and Alan Rickman in 2004.Photograph: Alan Davidson/ShutterstockI first met him at the Bush theatre, upstairs in a tiny space above a pub in 1980. I had just left university and begun my first ever job at the same theatre. I’d never been there before and wanted to see what was in store. I’ll never forget that drawl that had everyone captivated and his famous presence. He had me at: “Hellllooooo, my name’s Alan Rickman, and who might you be?” I guess I fell in love with him on the spot and was in total awe. I remained in awe of him for his whole life.He and his devoted, wonderful partner Rima – who he idolised – came to everything I ever did. He had quite a lot of pithy notes after the shows, but always positive suggestions to help me be better. Alan always wanted everyone to be better, not because he thought he knew best, but because he loved his friends and wanted the best for them.View image in fullscreenWith Rima Horton, 2015.Photograph: Mark Sullivan/WireImageEven when he was so ill in hospital, he didn’t want to talk about himself; he wanted us to make him laugh and fill him in with the latest gossip. Life without Alan isn’t the same, but his memory will forever live on. I’m a very lucky woman to have had him in my life. And I still have Rima, and that means so much as they were always together.I imagine Alan is giving notes even now to whoever’s up there with him, in that famous voice, with that twinkle in his eye. I just loved him, simple as that.Explore more on these topicsFilmAlan RickmanRichard CurtisBrian CoxLindsay DuncanHarriet WalterHelena KennedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Intimate photographs, showing in Australia for the first time, reveal the effect it hadRosamund BrennanWed 14 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Jan 2026 18.06 ESTShareFrom the Thin White Duke to Ziggy Stardust, the Berlin recluse to the late-career elegist,David Bowie’s oeuvreis defined by reinvention. As an artist he was relentlessly attuned to the conditions that might provoke the next creative rupture. One defining moment, however, has largely slipped from the popular imagination: a day spent inside a psychiatric hospital on the outskirts of Vienna – one that would prove unexpectedly formative.In September 1994, Bowie andBrian Eno– who had reunited to develop new music – accepted an invitation from the Austrian artist André Heller to visit the Maria Gugging psychiatric clinic. The site’s Haus der Künstler, established in 1981 as a communal home and studio, is known internationally as a centre for Art Brut – or “Outsider Art” – produced by residents, many living with schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders.View image in fullscreenDavid Bowie at the Maria Gugging psychiatric clinic in 1994.Photograph: Christine de GrancyThe acclaimed Austrian photographer Christine de Grancy documented the visit, capturing Bowie engaging with these so-called “outsider artists” – a term often criticised for framing artists through illness or marginality rather than authorship. For the first time, these intimate portraits will be shown in Australia, when A Day with David opens at Joondalup festival inWestern Australiain March, in collaboration with Santa Monica Art Museum.Through de Grancy’s lens, Bowie’s admiration for the artists is palpable. He crouches, listens, sketches, studies – his attention directed not towards the camera but toward the artists themselves.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning“They paint without any feeling of judgment,” Bowie told the music journalist Gene Stout ina 1995 interviewpublished in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. “Whatever they feel is what they paint.”The visit became a conceptual trigger for 1. Outside, Bowie’s dense, unsettling 1995 album, whose fractured narratives and moral ambiguity were partly shaped by the ideas he encountered there.View image in fullscreen‘They’ve painted every nook and crevice, the walls, all the trees outside,’ Bowie said. August Walla’s room at the Gugging clinic will be recreated at Joondalup festival.Photograph: Santa Monica Art MuseumAmong the artists Bowie met that day, August Walla made a particular impression. Walla’s work – layered with symbols, invented languages and obsessive repetition – extended far beyond paper, covering the walls and facade of the Haus der Künstler. By contrast, Oswald Tschirtner, who lived at Gugging for decades, worked with radical restraint, producing spare pencil drawings in which the human figure was reduced to elongated lines.“The stunning, rather cold atmosphere of the place is overwhelming,” Bowie told Stout. “You have to drive past the regular asylum before you get to their wing, which is completely covered in paint. They’ve painted every nook and crevice, the walls, all the trees outside. Everything that’s standing and still, they’ve painted.”View image in fullscreenArtist August Walla at the door of his room, which had a particular effect on Bowie.Photograph: Martin VukovitsWhen Bowie and Eno returned to the studio to make 1. Outside, they tried to emulate Gugging’s spontaneity and freedom. Bowie later recalled that the first thing they did was “get all the musicians together and make them redecorate the studio”, turning a rehearsal space into something more akin to the painted walls of Gugging. “They got into it so much that it was hard to get them into the music. What it did was give the whole thing a sense of play, which is a part of real freedom of expression.”Gugging itself carries a darker weight. Founded in the 19th century, the clinic was later absorbed into the Nazi’s Aktion T4 program, which targeted those with mental and physical disabilities, and resulted in the mass murder of an estimated 250,000 people. At Gugging alone, hundreds of patients were murdered or sent to extermination facilities.That history – of institutional violence towards the mentally ill – sits jarringly alongside Gugging’s reinvention as a haven for creativity. Bowie, whose own family life had been marked by mental illness, would have felt that tension acutely. His half-brother, Terry Burns, who lived with schizophrenia and died by suicide, haunted much of Bowie’s work.At Joondalup ContemporaryArtGallery, A Day with David will unfold as more than a conventional photography exhibition. Curated by Lisa Henderson, it will feature 28 framed black-and-white works by De Grancy alongside large-format photographic prints and a video component comprising vintage televisions stacked on internal plinths, playing archival footage as part of the installation. The exhibition also includes a full-scale recreation of Walla’s painted room, with his iconography covering the walls from floor to ceiling.‘The Beethoven of our day’: Fans on what David Bowie meant to them 10 years after his deathRead moreSadly, De Grancy died on 20 March 2025, just weeks before A Day with David opened at the Santa Monica Art Museum. After sitting in her archive for nearly three decades, the photographs were only brought together as a coherent body of work at the end of her life. What they offer, the general manager of the Santa Monica Art Museum, Ricardo Puentes, says is not celebrity or voyeurism, but proximity. “They feel very candid,” he says. “You don’t feel like you’re looking in. You’re invited into the space.”View image in fullscreenPatients at the clinic on the day De Grancy and Bowie visited.Photograph: Christine de GrancySpeaking in a video recorded for a 2023 exhibition at Museum Gugging, De Grancy described Bowie as “the star – the world star – who was so completely understated. That kind of presence is not something I associate with stardom at all. He was very withdrawn, extremely observant.”What the photographs ultimately show, as Puentes puts it, is not a star at all: “It’s really not about him being at the forefront. It’s him being open to other people’s experiences.”A Day with David opens at Joondalup Contemporary Art Gallery on 7 March as part of Joondalup festivalExplore more on these topicsDavid BowieBrian EnoArtWestern AustraliaPhotographyGermanyMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s the middle of January and the festive season is well and truly over – but not in panto-land. Pantomimes are still running in Liverpool, at the city’sRoyal CourtandEverymantheatres, and atTheatr Clwydin Mold, among other venues. But does panto feel different once the Christmas holidays have ended and might it serve another purpose amid the January gloom?Nottingham Playhouse’sSleeping Beautyruns until this weekend, closing just before Blue Monday which is supposedly the most depressing day of the year. John Elkington is playing Nelly the Nanny in the show and has been Nottingham’s dame for almost 30 years. He says that for audiences who come in January, perhaps after being cooped up at home, “it’s something to look forward to” and one more treat after Christmas. “It feels like an extension for the children, keeping the fun up: you know, ‘there’s still the panto to go to!’ Our audiences are very loyal and supportive. Just because we’ve come into the new year and we do fewer shows – six a week rather than the 12 a week we do before Christmas – our job is to keep up the energy, not let it slip.” It’s a demanding gig – Elkington only gets to put his feet up on Christmas Day and New Year’s Day.About 40,000 people visit theNottingham Playhousepanto each year. Elkington says the audiences are “bigger and more animated” in the run-up to Christmas and that they do thin out afterwards. There are also more relaxed and access performances in January, designed for smaller audiences and adapted to be quieter. Throughout the run, Elkington approaches each show as if his whole family is in the front row.The riotous last night of the Nottingham panto, when the crew play tricks on the cast, has built up such a reputation that audiences who have already seen the show come back a second time. “They’ve seen it as it should be and then they come that night as well – anything can happen,” says Elkington, remembering the year there were 15 crew members and three of the band on stage and “an enormous pillow fight erupted”. Nottingham Playhouse is one of the few theatres to put its pantoonline– Sleeping Beauty, written and directed by Playhouse boss Adam Penford, is available on demand until Saturday night, when the final performance takes place.View image in fullscreen‘100% of everything’ … The Scouse Christmas Carol at the Royal Court in Liverpool.Photograph: AB PhotographyAt Liverpool’s Royal Court, The ScouseChristmasCarol was originally due to close this weekend but it has been so popular that it will now run until 24 January. It is not only one of the country’s last Christmas pantos to close but was one of the first to open, back on 7 November.“For most people, the panto is about leading up to Christmas,” says the theatre’s executive producer, Kevin Fearon, who is also the writer of the production, directed by Mark Chatterton. Many of those booking for January, Fearon says, will be coming because they were unable to secure seats for December. Audience demand is especially high for tickets for the stalls where you can be served a meal at your table before the show. This dining option is a popular feature at the Royal Court throughout the year. “People want to come out with their families and have a party, have a meal.”The panto is “our perfect show of the year”, he says, as it captures what the Royal Court is all about: “great entertainment with a great atmosphere in the room – 100% of everything”. In the cold of January, when the days are short and people are back at work, it’s a chance for a big night out to lift your spirits. The cost of living has led to some theatregoers reducing their trips to the Royal Court over the year but people remain committed to the panto, says Fearon. The audience often builds for the final weeks as word of mouth spreads. “We’ll take around £1.4m in ticket sales plus food and drink. That counts for more than half of our ticket sales for the year – it funds the rest of the year.” Within weeks of the panto closing, the team will have picked the title for the next show and started work on it. “People decide to bring more friends and family each year. We need to keep living up to previous years. There’s an expectation.”View image in fullscreen‘Its own tradition’ … Pinocchio and his Wooden Whopper at Brick Lane Music Hall.Photograph: Lucy Hayes PhotographyLike the Nottingham Playhouse panto, any references to Christmas are usually tweaked or taken out for the later performances of the Royal Court panto but that wasn’t an option with their mischievous take on A Christmas Carol. “It’s the first time we haven’t changed the last song of the show,” says Fearon. In Nottingham, the panto usually ends with a Christmas tune – during January this is swapped for a reprise of another number in the show.But some pantos aren’t designed for Christmas at all.Brick Lane Music Hallin east London is opening Jack and His Giant Stalk on 22 January and it runs until 7 March. Described as “a pantomime for grownups”, not as rude as the increasingly popularadult pantos, the show is written and directed by Lucy Hayes. It’s the second panto she has created for the venue after, ahem, Pinocchio and his Wooden Whopper.“We do a Christmas variety show with carols and all that jazz,” she says. “They used to do that for two weeks and then a panto for two weeks. But Christmas is the most popular time of the year so they were starting the Christmas show a week earlier, in November, and extending the panto for a week into January and they were selling and selling and selling. At least 10 years ago, they thought: what if we put the Christmas show on before Christmas and then the panto afterwards?”View image in fullscreen‘It’s very fun and silly and celebratory’ … Lucy Hayes.Photograph: East PhotographyIt has become, says Hayes, “its own tradition”. For many people, panto is about anticipating the holidays. What does a January-to-March pantomime offer? “Christmas is such a busy period, with seeing family and so on, people may have more time afterwards,” she says – and they may “need more cheering up, lifting out of the blues”. Their panto is “very fun and silly and celebratory – we go all-in on that”. Like the Royal Court, the venue serves food before the show – either an afternoon tea or a meal in the evening – and many of the audiences at the 180-seater have their own tradition of when they come during the run.Brick Lane Music Hall was founded in 1992 by her father, the performer Vincent Hayes, who she is now directing in the show. She remembers the joy of panto from her childhood: “I thought it was so exciting that as an audience member you could go up on stage. That blew my mind. I was always the brat who put their hand up, desperate to go on … I felt like it was for me because I was invited into it, which was different to the West End or a play.”There are companies that perform pantomimeat other times of the year, especially in Easter and half-term holidays. Even spooky ones are put on for Halloween. But Brick Lane Music Hall stands out for opening its panto right after most have just closed. “People are often surprised but they’re won over when you explain it to them – it is a fun idea,” says Hayes. It also means, of course, less competition for an audience than you’d find during the panto-stuffed month of December. “We’ve made our own market,” she says with a laugh.Sleeping Beautyis at Nottingham Playhouse and online until 17 January.The Scouse Christmas Carolis at the Royal Court, Liverpool, until 24 January.Jack and His Giant Stalkis at Brick Lane Music Hall, London, 22 January-7 March.Explore more on these topicsTheatrePanto seasonNottingham PlayhouseLiverpoolComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)ChristmasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Can I change my game completely in my mid-30s?For fifteen years I have been devoted to the sport, but can still barely tackle or shoot. I decided to get a coach and give him the challenge of a lifetimePoppy NoorWed 14 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Jan 2026 06.24 ESTShareIf I told you I have played football for 15 years, you’d probably assume that I’m decent. Unfortunately, I am not. I have three left feet and a not-very-convincing shot on goal. Despite how many years I have put into the sport, these things show little to no improvement.I play football for the joy of it: the rush of the first whistle; the exhilaration of making a successful tackle or a clever pass; and the feeling of all fears and concerns melting away the moment the game starts. So until recently, the fact that I’m so bad at it occurred to me as, at worst, incidental. I grew up at a time when football was largely considered a men’s sport. In the 90s, there were about80 girls’ football clubsin England (there are more than12,000 now); therewasn’t a women’s premier league until 1994; and by the time I was in my 20s, boring jokes about women knowing the offside rule were wheeled out with disappointing regularity. As someone who still remembers the feeling of getting kicked off the pitch by the boys as soon as I entered year 3, I’ve always just felt blessed to play.View image in fullscreen‘It’s going to be a battle’ … Poppy Noor with coach Wayne Phillips.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianBut after a while, I did start to find it a bit depressing being so comically awful at something that I love. I’m fed up with starting team after team for beginners, only to watch all those who have never kicked a ball before get better than me by the end of the season.So this year, I wondered if I could break the cycle: could someone like me – a player so awful at football that if you watched me play you would truly, honestly, gasp – ever get any better? Is getting better at sport something that can happen in your mid-30s, after you’ve had kids, especially if it’s something you’ve thrown hours into but at which you seem to be cosmically ungifted? I decided I would try.“It’s going to be a battle,” says my coach during our first phone call. It’s a sunny day in August and I’m sitting in the garden with my dog curled at my feet, but I suddenly feel a shadow of a cloud pass over. At least he’s honest, I think.I know Wayne Phillips from his work with women’s teams, and I’ve always been impressed with how far he can take players. Phillips asks me to come to our first session with a few ideas on my strengths and weaknesses. I come with mostly weaknesses: I can’t cross or shoot properly; I freeze whenever I have to make a basic judgment call under pressure; and I can’t run very fast while keeping the ball. I am good at anticipating where the ball will go, and getting there in good time. I also think I’m a good team player, always cheering on my team and getting overly excited at even the most lukewarm attempt from one of my teammates on goal.View image in fullscreenOn the ball … Poppy.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianPhillips believes that someone’s footballing ability can be broken down into a few core principles. First is their physicality: are they fast? Strong? Prone to injury? Then their technical skill – how well they pass, dribble, shoot and tackle. Social attributes are just as important: I’ve played many a football match where a skilled player refuses to pass, and find it frustratingly similar to that episode ofFrozen Planetwhere huge bison find themselves demolished by a pack of wolves because they just don’t know how to work together. Finally, there’s a player’s psychology: their resilience, concentration and ability to manage their emotions.We agree to a strict schedule of training: one-on-one coaching sessions once a week, alongside group training and weekly matches. Phillips will map my progress, and make a plan tailored to my strengths and weaknesses. I promise to work on my strength and fitness.In our first session, we do a drill where I have to dribble and turn, but I can barely keep hold of the ball. We begin a short set of drills on tricks to deceive and misdirect. First up: the Cruyff turn, in which you plant one leg and start off as if you’re going to run in one direction, while sneakily tapping the ball the other way. We practice step-overs, too, as well as simple feints. I fail terribly at everything.View image in fullscreenPoppy Noor (centre) with her team at Somers Town Community Sports Centre in north London.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianBy the end of our first session, I decide it’s all been pitched at a cruelly unrealistic standard. I pray Phillips feels the same, and that we can just stick to dribbling and passing in our future sessions.They say in therapy that the reason you think you’re there is never the actual reason. Same, too, with football training. I thought I was coming to tighten up on some core skills. But three weeks in, I’m learning that therealreason I’m here is that I’ve painted myself into a little corner, and it’s prevented me from progressing.I’ve often treated football like an uninterested lover: happy to say I’m in it for the laughs, and too nervous to take my problems with it seriously, for fear of being let down. I’ve always played in defence, because I decided it was a reactive and less technical position, where I could barge and shove my way to decent results, without finessing my footwork. Taking the ball forward, trying to score or set up a goal – I’ve always assumed these were jobs for somebody else.Phillips picks up on this straight away. He notices how I don’t know how to receive the ball in anything other than the most basic stance: square on, and moving in a straight line. To be good, he explains, you have to create angles; to receive and pass from any position on the pitch, and to take the ball in surprising directions. So we begin to work on expanding my repertoire. Wayne gets me to practise receiving the ball on my back foot so I can quickly turn with it. He teaches me the concept of a reverse pass: where you send the ball at an almost impossible-seeming and counterintuitive angle at the last moment. Gradually I learn how to receive a pass while in motion, rather than standing still.View image in fullscreenFast-paced and relentless … Poppy playing mixed five-a-side.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianAt group training, I get to try out these new skills. We also work on me learning how to attack, which is where my mind really starts to expand. I learn to pin my opponent back to stop them from getting the ball, rather than waiting for them to get it. These concepts are all exciting and new, and I tell myself that if I can nail them, good things will come.But it’s not an easy road. Most weeks, I play a match with my team and find it embarrassing when they ask me when they’re going to see the results of my training. Not yet, I say – but I leave out the part where I wonder if they ever will.‘Can we have a chat?” I say to Phillips one Sunday before our usual session. We are little over a month into our training and I feel slightly childish coming with problems so soon, like a student who says she doesn’t understand the assignment before even trying.But I have been trying, and I just seem to be getting worse. The group trainings that I once felt competent in now leave me feeling tragically behind. In matches, I feel I’ve got actively worse, making rookie errors and suddenly unable to shoot or pass in the right direction. I find it laughable that just a few weeks ago Phillips was teaching me new turns and tricks when I still can’t do basic things, such as keeping the ball after it’s been passed to me.View image in fullscreenPoppy: ‘Once I realise I have a problem, my game eminently improves.’Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian“You’re reinventing yourself,” says Phillips. “The process of improving requires setbacks.”We move to our weekly drills, in which I am unable to pass a ball into the top-left corner of the pitch, unable to dribble around some cones and fall over my own feet when trying to receive a pass. None of this feels like reinvention, I think. It just feels like being worse.But I try to keep something in mind. “The way you talk to yourself, it’s invasive,” says Phillips. “It seeps into all of your decision-making. I’m not telling you not to be critical, but all of this ‘I’m rubbish’ stuff? Just leave it at the door.”That, at least, feels like something I can work on.My friend has provided me with a new metaphor. It pertains to trumpet playing. Many good trumpet players, if they want to become professional, find themselves at a crossroads. At amateur levels, many student trumpeters are taught “a bit of a shitty mouth position” (as my friend Barbara puts it). This mouth position is called your embouchure, and if you want to go pro, it’s advisable to relearn it.“It’s like you’re going through a process of fixing your embouchure,” Barbara tells me.I take Barbara’s lesson home with me and eventually something clicks. I realise that over the past few weeks, I’ve been trying to define the direction of play rather than just react to it. In the process of doing so, loads of my old footballing mistakes had crept back in.A few years ago, when I played football in New York, I lamented that I could never receive the ball without it shooting off in some other direction. A teammate explained that my foot was too “hard” – so I had to learn to cushion the ball with my foot. This and other early errors had re-entered my gameplay. While my brain started focusing on new things, such as how to take a shot on goal, I stopped focusing on some of the elemental parts of passing, such as having my head and body over the ball. And in trying to think ahead, I stopped focusing on the basics, such as: don’t pass the ball right in front of your own goal; or, always receive the ball with the inside of your foot.View image in fullscreenPoppy and Wayne during a one-on-one coaching session.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianThey say the first step to improving is realising you have a problem – and once I realise this, my game does improve. In one group session, I score a goal off a header. In a one-on-one, I start combining tricks in sequences: running with the ball, doing a step-over, turning, dragging the ball back with the centre of my foot before running off and doing a Cruyff turn. I learn to feint, double feint, double stepover. I even start wondering whether I should become a striker.“I have to admit,” Phillips says, after a successful training session. “When I first saw you on the ball – the way you handled it – I thought, how am I going to deal with this?”. Looking at me now, he says he feels proud. “Every action you made today was clean,” he adds.There was a period about four years ago when I decided I wanted to be a good footballer. After playing for more than a decade, I’d joined a very good seven-a-side team in New York and I wanted to be like them. So I started going to the park every day. I practised kick-ups, improving from barely being able to get the ball up off the ground, to one kick-up, to six or seven. I passed the ball against the wall relentlessly, trying to improve my passing and dribbling. I did this most days for a year. And even though I still wasn’tgoodat football, I did improve somewhat.View image in fullscreenPoppy … ‘I feel accomplished.’Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianSince I started training with Phillips, time has been the elephant in the room. I was seven months out from giving birth to my second child when I contacted him, still breastfeeding, and more strapped for time than I’ve ever been. I can’t get better by throwing hours at something in the same way any more.But during our last session, I am pleased to see that putting carefully cultivated hours in, wherever I can, has made the difference. We do a drill where I have to keep the ball and get past Phillips with it, by using my new skills of misdirection. I win almost every time.“You take your life seriously,” says Phillips at the end of the session, which surprises me. He is talking about the fact that I’ve been running on my lunch break at work to get fitter, and going to yoga and the gym to stop myself from getting injured. These were things I felt I had to do, as an overcompensation for being bad. It’s nice to hear someone reframe it. When he puts it all together, it does suddenly feel impressive. “You know what goals you have for yourself. And you make them happen.”To finish our work together, Phillips comes to watch me play in a match. It’s brutal – I play mixed five-a-side, which is fast-paced and relentless, and in this particular match all of the guys in the other team are about 6ft 3in and able to lob the ball at the net from a distance. It’s not quite the end I had in mind for my last match under Phillips’ supervision, but as I walk off the pitch, muddy boots in hand, I feel accomplished. Phillips is right. I might not be the best footballer, but I set myself the goal to get better, and in the end, maybe – justmaybe! –I did it. That feels worth it.Explore more on these topicsHobbiesWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Palmer knew she and her girls needed to escape – but it would involve huge risk and total reinventionWed 14 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTShareIn the summer of 1989, Karen Palmer bought a used car for cash, filled it with belongings – some clothes, toys, one pot, one pan and a shoebox of photos – and “disappeared” with her new husband and two young daughters. She didn’t tell her mother, her friends or her neighbours where she was going. She gave no notice to her employers and landlord, leaving items out on her apartment balcony as a sign she still lived there.“I have such a clear memory of the day we left Los Angeles,” says Palmer. “It was this weird combination of fear and exhilaration, heart pounding, driving into the unknown.” Palmer was fleeing her ex-husband, Gil, the man she feared, and the father of her two daughters, Erin and Amy, then seven and three.They headed east, and eventually stopped at Boulder, Colorado, in the foothills of the Rocky mountains, partly because Gil would never think to look for them there. “I’ve always lived on the coast as I liked to be near the ocean,” she says. “He would not expect me to go inland.” They had no ID, no references, no papers linking them to who they were. In the weeks that followed, they changed their names, faked documents, found jobs, a home and a school for the girls. Palmer terms it “do-it-yourself witness protection”: she was “one person one day, and the next someone else”.View image in fullscreenKaren Palmer on the day she married Gil, in May 1980.Photograph: Courtesy of Karen PalmerIt worked. Gil never found them. She stayed in touch with friends and family by phone so they knew they were safe – but didn’t tell them (even her mother) where she was, so that they wouldn’t know if Gil came and demanded information.The family thrived under their new names. The girls grew up. Yet those ordinary, uneventful decades that followed gave Palmer space and time to doubt all that had gone before. “I spent 20 years questioning whether I had done the right thing, and that felt terrible,” she says. “It’s a big thing to take a man’s children away. It’s the worst thing you can do to somebody.” Had it been an overreaction? How real was the danger? Should she have stayed, and fought through the courts for a better, legal solution? Palmer’s newly published memoir, She’s Under Here, attempts to answer these questions.Through all the years Palmer spent with Gil, she never heard the terms “domestic abuse”, “coercive control” or “gaslighting”, although she now knows that this is what she lived with. “Courts and law enforcement still don’t take it as seriously as they should. But 35 years ago we didn’t even have the vocabulary,” she says. “Over the course of the relationship, I never went to a shelter. I didn’t know anyone who had even been abused, which doesn’t mean that they weren’t. ‘Grooming’ is another thing I had no language for – but what happened was absolutely that.”Palmer had been painfully vulnerable when she met Gil. She was an adopted only child; her father was an alcoholic and her parents had a difficult marriage. “It was not a happy home,” she says.At 16, she became pregnant by a teenage boyfriend, and went to the maternity home where she herself had been born and adopted. She describes it like a “fairytale”. Girls entered, gestated, delivered and departed. She was allowed to hold her son for one hour – “solid as a football” – before he was taken from her and she returned home. A couple of months later, back in college, she took a part-time job in an office supply firm. Gil was her boss. He was 36, a father of three, in the process of divorcing.“After giving up the baby, I was in this deep grief and I mistook that grief for maturity,” she says. “I couldn’t be around teenage boys. They were abhorrent to me. An older man meant something different.” By now, Palmer’s father was in hospital with the cancer that would kill him, and though her mother never liked Gil, she accepted the relationship.View image in fullscreenPalmer today, at her home in LA.Photograph: Philip Cheung/The Guardian“She was very weirdly religious, and I think she thought that an older man would be more accepting of ‘tainted goods’,” says Palmer. “And also, it was the 70s. Lots of rock’n’roll stars had teenage girlfriends. It was a different era.”Gil was wild and funny, impulsive and very charismatic – Palmer describes him as “a salesman to the core”. He looked like Jack Nicholson and was sometimes mistaken for him. A functioning alcoholic, he was never faithful. Palmer caught him with another woman a few weeks before their wedding and this continued.Their marriage lasted 14 years, much of it centred around the “ordinary” raising of their two daughters, with Gil moving between jobs and money-making schemes. He was rarely violent, but bullied and belittled Palmer. He didn’t like her to have friends. He somehow kept her in tight parameters. “There was an undercurrent of control,” she says, “and the long stretches of normal day-to-day were punctuated by moments of intense stress and fear.” In one, Gil pointed a loaded gun at Palmer’s pregnant belly – she grabbed his arm and the gun exploded into the sink. In another, he locked her in the broom cupboard and took the children, aged two and six, out for the day. When they finally came home, he turned it into a game, telling the children “mommy’s hiding” and helping them look for her.When Palmer left him, she had begun a relationship with their close friend Vinnie, who Gil had known for years. (She and Vinnie are still married today.) “When I first filed for divorce from Gil, I always thought in the back of my mind that he would get over it,” says Palmer. “Eventually, we’d have a normal divorce and he’d be a normal divorced father who’d see the kids when he wanted. But he just got worse and worse.”View image in fullscreenPalmer in 1985 - eating steak and corn with four-year-old Erin.Photograph: Courtesy of Karen PalmerGil’s fury was compounded by alcohol and substance abuse. He fell apart and stopped working. For two years, he stalked Palmer, threatening to kill her and Vinnie, and to put her head in the fridge for the children to find. He head-butted her, slashed their tyres, threw rotten meat in their yard, stuck dynamite on Vinnie’s windscreen wipers, superglued their gate. He phoned so often that she had to have another line installed so she could speak to other people.For two years, they lived like this. “I didn’t sleep well. I lost my ability to read a book or even a newspaper as I couldn’t focus. I got scary skinny because I had no appetite.” The police were unhelpful – their response to the death threats was: “Call us when he’s in your apartment.” The divorce lawyers were somehow charmed by Gil. (“That’s a nice guy,” one told Palmer. “Divorce is messy!”) Yet, even if she’d been taken seriously, Palmer doubts any intervention could have really helped her. Arresting Gil – and ultimately releasing him – would have brought him straight to her door, whatever the consequences. “And he’d have been worse because he’d have been mad,” she says. Gil would have laughed in the face of a restraining order and the thought of jail didn’t seem to bother him.It was a kidnapping that finally made her flee. Custody and contact still hadn’t been settled when, during a fraught, harried “handover”, after Gil had spent unscheduled time with Erin, he took three-year-old Amy from Palmer’s arms – she had handed Amy over in order to embrace Erin – and walked briskly away. He disappeared, travelled 60 miles, dyed Amy’s blond hair brown and cropped it short to disguise her as a boy. Palmer and Vinnie made up flyers, drove the streets, called everyone Gil knew. She was awarded emergency custody of the children and a warrant was issued for Gil’s arrest.When I first filed for divorce from Gil, I always thought we’d have a normal divorce. But he just got worse and worse“It was the worst thing that ever happened to me – and I gave up a child for adoption – but in my mind, at least, that was for the best, to give that child a family,” says Palmer. “This time, a maniac had taken charge of my daughter.”After 10 days, Gil called and ranted while Palmer begged, pleaded and wept. After 45 minutes, he agreed to return Amy if Palmer promised to leave Vinnie. She agreed. The handover took place the following night on a San Francisco street corner. (“No cops,” he’d warned.) The very next day, Palmer, Vinnie, Amy and Erin fled.Palmer had recorded that phone call with Gil but never listened to it until she came to write her memoir. “I carted the tape with me everywhere because it was evidence of this thing that happened, but I was afraid of hearing his voice,” she says. Playing it back was like being in the room with him. “His voice, his pet phrases, his weird cliches, were so distinctive to me. I was shaking through the entire thing.”On the recording, she could hear Amy singing in the background and herself sobbing and whining. And then Gil.The transcription set out in the book is chilling.You can see how easy it was for me to take her? I could do it again and again and again. Wake up to reality! … And I don’t care who’s looking for me. Do you have the police there now? No, you know better. I’d just get violent … [Police] don’t want to be bothered anyway. Until you kill somebody. Then they listen to you. I’m telling you, I’ve been absolutely insane. Suicidal, maniacal. I hate. I am full of hate … I either have to kill somebody and get it over with, and then I’ll be able to relax, or I get my way …View image in fullscreen‘I realised … [that] I didn’t get to be a real person until I left’.’Photograph: Philip Cheung/The GuardianAmy’s young, that’s why I took her. Isn’t it sick? It took seven days for her to completely forget about you. Isn’t that sad? She was tough the first three, but now, the last six have been nothing. It’s like, no memory. Totally gone. She doesn’t miss Erin, she doesn’t know who that is. She doesn’t miss anything. Everything is out of her life. Right now she only knows me, and that’s who she loves. Daddy.“At the point when I finally played it back, I was still asking myself: did I do the right thing? Was it really necessary to go?” says Palmer. “But I did the right thing – and I’d do it again.”Their escape and “reinvention” would not be possible now. “You couldn’t do what we did,” she says. “There was no internet, no social media. Each state was in charge of its own records without much cross-referencing.” In Boulder, they chose Palmer as a new surname for everyone, although the girls kept their first names. Palmer’s birth name is Kerry – she became Karen, as it was similar enough to explain any slips. Vinnie switched his first and middle names around. They both took new driving tests to secure new licences.“We were just a regular family on the block,” says Palmer. Vinnie found work restoring furniture and Palmer as a graphic designer. “Amy has no memory of Gil, but Erin was seven, and the amazing thing is that in all those years, even through her teens, she never told anyone. She understood that it was serious.”Writing the memoir has taken years. “One of the difficulties was that I had these dramatic things that happened to me and then 20 years where not much happened,” she says. “What I came to realise was that the second half was actually as important, if not more important. It’s as if I didn’t get to be a real person until I left.“For years, Gil was pushing me down, under his thumb, telling me, ‘You’re ugly’, ‘You’re stupid.’ Vinnie was the first person who thought I was funny. I could have friends. I could feel competent. If the dishes didn’t get done, there was nobody to yell at me. I could find interesting work, be good to people and have them actually be good to me.”View image in fullscreen‘Writing the book was an exorcism’ … Palmer at home.Photograph: Philip Cheung/The GuardianGil died in 2008 – although Palmer didn’t discover this until years later. He had spent his final years in and out of jail for firearms offences, chronic substance abuse, assault and resisting arrest. By the end, he was living in a tent in a city park. “Writing the book was a kind of exorcism,” says Palmer. “I don’t feel angry at him any more. I feel angry that we had to go through this, but I feel pity for him that he ruined his life and it was all so unnecessary.”Legally straightening out their true identities after learning of Gil’s death was a lengthy, messy process. Palmer and Vinnie now live back in LA. Erin and Amy are in other states, but they are a tight unit – Vinnie officially adopted them, at their request, when they were 20 and 25. “He is, without doubt, the love of my life,” says Palmer. “It was kind of a wartime romance. Nothing could pull us apart after that.”For Palmer, it was changing her identity that gave her herself – and she has been surprised by the way other women have responded to her book. Many have told her that running away and starting over still seems to be the best option. “There’s this whole sisterhood,” she says, “these women who come and tell me what happened to them. All kinds of women have said, ‘I wish I could do that. If only I could.’”She’s Under Here: A Memoir by Karen Palmer is published by Algonquin Books (£25).Explore more on these topicsWomenDomestic violenceFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I usually have them with a poached egg for protein or apple compote and soya yoghurt.Root vegetable and linseed latkesThis is a great way to use up any tired root vegetables lurking in the crisper drawer, and a recipe I come back to again and again. Latkes are a traditional Jewish potato cake that work really well made with other root vegetables as well. If I have a few different coloured vegetables, I will grate and mix the vegetables separately to make multicoloured latkes, but it’s much simpler to mix them all together.I used carrot leaves to decorate this dish. They’re beautiful but bitter, so use sparingly. Herbs are optional, of course, but if you want to add some colour, fresh flat-leaf parsley or coriander will freshen it up no end, too. And sauerkraut,which I made for last week’s column, is another wonderful traditional accompaniment to latkes, not least because its sour twang cuts through the rich fried flavour of the veg cakes.Serves2150g mixed root vegetables, grated (eg, beetroot, celeriac, turnip, etc)1 onion, peeled and gratedSea salt1 tbsp flour(wholegrain or plain), or 2 tbsp fine breadcrumbs1 tbsp wholegrain mustard(optional)2 tbsp ground linseeds1 tsp baking powderExtra-virgin olive oil, for fryingTo serve (all optional)Carrot leaves, or parsley leavesSauerkrautPoached eggsApple compote and yoghurtCombine the grated root vegetables and onion in a bowl with a good couple of pinches of sea salt and leave to sit for five minutes to draw out some of the excess moisture from the vegetables and ensure a nice, crisp end result. Pick up handfuls of the veg mixture, squeeze out all the excess liquid from each one as you go (save the liquid, because, mixed with extra-virgin olive oil, it makes a fabulous dressing), then put the squeezed vegetables in a clean bowl. Add the flour or breadcrumbs, optional mustard, linseed and baking powder, and mix well to combine.Put a little olive oil in a frying pan on a medium heat. Divide the vegetable mixture into four balls, lay them in the pan, then flatten the latkes slightly with a spatula and leave them well alone for three to five minutes, until they are golden on the underside. Carefully flip them over and cook for a few more minutes, until golden brown on the other side. Serve hot with your chosen toppings, or save and reheat later in the oven.Explore more on these topicsBreakfastWaste notFoodFood wasteVegetablesSnacksBrunchfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A couvert, comprising bread, butter, pickled or garlic carrots, cheese and fish paté (often sardine), comes as standard at every Portuguese restaurant and family dinner table alike, as it does atour restaurant Luso, where our fish paste is an ode to this way of dining. The mushroom tart, meanwhile, celebrates the Portuguese love of pastry and is a take on a traditional savoury tart. While such tarts are unlikely to feature solely mushrooms (they’re much more likely to be mixed vegetable tarts), we like to focus on the incredible varietals of this single ingredient.Smoked fish and vegetable paste (pictured top)A smooth, savoury blend of smoked fish and sweet vegetables that’s ideal as a spread, dip or toast topper. For a softer spread, stir a tablespoon of creme fraiche into the veg mix after blending.Prep25 minCook35 minMakes300gFor the fish paste300g undyed smoked haddock or cod fillet, skinless and boneless600ml whole milk1 bay leaf60ml olive oil(about 4 tbsp)½ brown onion(about 120g), peeled and chopped1 small carrot(about 120g), peeled and chopped½ small fennel bulb(about 100g), trimmed and chopped1 garlic clove, peeled and sliced½ tbsp pink peppercorns, or black peppercorns50ml white wine(optional)Sea salt and black pepperFor the chilli oil (optional)100ml rapeseed oil½ tsp chilli flakes1 small bay leafPut the smoked haddock, milk and bay leaf in a medium saucepan, bring to a gentle simmer, then leave to poach for six to eight minutes, until the fish flakes easily. Gently lift the fish out of the milk, leave it to cool slightly, then flake into small pieces; discard the milk and bay leaf.Next, cook the vegetables. In a frying pan, warm the olive oil on a medium heat, then add the onion, carrot, fennel, garlic and peppercorns, and cook gently, stirring, for 10 minutes, until soft and fragrant, but not browned. Stir in the white wine, if using, and leave it to bubble away until almost all the liquid evaporates.Tip the vegetable mixture into a blender or food processor, blitz until very smooth, then tip into a medium bowl. Fold in the flaked fish until it’s thoroughly combined, then season with sea salt and black pepper to taste. The paste will now keep for up to three days in a sealed container in the fridge.To make the optional chilli oil, warm the rapeseed oil in a small pan, take off the heat and stir in the chilli flakes and bay leaf. Leave to infuse for 15 minutes, then decant into a clean jar and seal (if you like, strain it first).To serve, spoon the fish paste into a bowl, drizzle over a little chilli oil to taste, if using, and serve with toast, crackers or crudités.Mushroom tartView image in fullscreenKimberley Hernandez’s mushroom tart.Prep20 minCook1 hr 10 minServes2For the mushroom caramel1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil1-1½ shallots, peeled and finely chopped (35g net)100g chestnut mushrooms, finely chopped (and add any of the trimmings from slicing the mushrooms below)2 tbsp light soy sauceFor the tart160g ready-rolled puff pastry(ie, ½ a regular 320g pack), cut in half into two rectanglesOlive oil80g king oyster mushrooms, cut into ½cm-thick slicesSea salt80g shiitake mushrooms, cut into ½cm-thick slices80g oyster mushrooms, cut into ½cm-thick slices80g chestnut mushrooms, or button mushrooms, cut into ½cm-thick slices70g maitake mushrooms, cut into ½cm-thick slices (if unavailable, use an extra 70g shiitake instead)First, make the caramel. Put the oil in a small pan on medium heat, add the chopped shallot and saute gently, stirring, for 10-12 minutes, until lightly caramelised. Add the chestnut mushrooms, cook for another 10 minutes, until soft and reduced, then stir in the soy sauce. Puree until smooth, then set aside.Now for the tart. Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Lay the two pastry rectangles on a large oven tray (or individual trays) lined with baking paper. Bake for three to five minutes, until the pastry is slightly puffed up and lightly golden, then remove and turn down the oven to 200C (180C)/390F/gas 6.Put a little olive oil in a medium frying pan on a high heat, then carefully fry the king oyster mushrooms, seasoned with a little sea salt, on both sides for a minute or two, until golden. Transfer to a small plate, then repeat one by one with each variety of the remaining mushrooms, keeping them all separate.Spread a thin layer of the mushroom caramel over each pastry base. Arrange the seared king oyster mushroom slices on top, then brush with another light layer of caramel. Repeat one by one with all the other mushrooms, adding a smear of caramel between each variety to help build flavour and structure, and finishing with the maitake (or extra shiitake) on top, again brushed with caramel. Return to the oven for eight to 10 minutes, until the pastry is golden and crisp. Serve hot or at room temperature with a crisp green salad.Kimberley Hernandez is head chef atLuso, London W1Explore more on these topicsFoodPortuguese food and drinkFishSeafoodVegetablesStarterMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

Also, the HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) phone lines will be much busier in the final few days.If you are unsure if you need to do one, there is anonline toolon the HMRC website that you can use to check.View image in fullscreenThe deadline for doing your tax return for the tax year running from 6 April 2024 to 5 April 2025 is 31 January.Photograph: DWImages/AlamyOne of the first tasks is to find all the documents and information that you need, such as your P60, P45, P11D or PAYE coding notices and tax certificates for investments. That may mean logging into your company’s intranet or asking someone, so give yourself time in case this isn’t straightforward.Use the HMRC appYou can use the tax department’sfree and secure HMRC appto obtain and check a lot of the information, from your self-assessment “unique taxpayer reference” to details of your employment income.You can also use it to set a reminder to make a self-assessment payment and ask HMRC’s digital assistant for help. It is likely to be a lot quicker than rummaging through paperwork or ringing up and waiting to speak to someone on the phone.Remember side hustlesA second job that you do as an employee should already be taxed, but if you earn extra money through freelance work, casual jobs such as babysitting or dog walking, letting property, or trading of any kind you may need to pay HMRC.Everyone hasa trading allowance of £1,000each tax year, which means you can earn up to that much on top of your main job without paying tax.If you earned more than £1,000 in total from side hustles in 2024-25, you will need to register for self-assessment as a sole trader and do a return (and pay any tax due) by the end of January.View image in fullscreenIf you earn extra money through casual jobs such as dog walking you may need to pay HMRC.Photograph: Westend61/Getty ImagesRemember your savingsWhen savings rates were really low, only those with very large sums in standard savings accounts were in danger of breaching thepersonal savings allowancesof £1,000 for basic-rate taxpayers and £500 for higher-rate taxpayers. But because interest rates have increased, many people will have exceeded their allowance and be in a position where they have to declare income from savings.There are lots of onlinecalculatorsthat will help you work out if you are one of them. If you are earning 4% interest on your savings, you can hold up to £25,000 before facing tax as a basic-rate payer, or £12,500 as a higher-rate payer.Savings in tax-free accounts such as Isas and some NS&I products do not count towards your allowance.View image in fullscreenInterest rates have increased, so many people will have exceeded their allowance and have to declare the income from savings.Photograph: mundissima/AlamyUse pension tax reliefFor many, the section of the form on pensions and tax is one of the most daunting. But if you are entitled to make a claim and don’t, you are losing out.How it works depends on what type of scheme you are in. Net pay arrangements – used by many traditional workplace pension schemes – don’t require you to do anything to get tax relief. With these, your contributions are deducted from your pay by your employer before income tax is calculated, so you get relief immediately at your highest rate of tax.View image in fullscreenThe high income child benefit charge is a way for the amount paid to higher earners to be clawed back via the tax system on a sliding scale.Photograph: Ian Jones/AlamyBut the rules are different if you are in a “relief at source” scheme – used by personal pension plans, plus some workplace schemes. If you are a 20% taxpayer, no further adjustment needs to be made, but higher-rate taxpayers usually have to make a claim via their tax return to receive the extra relief due to them.To do this you need to enter the total you paid in during the year, plus the basic rate tax relief you received. If you have contributed £700, for example, the figure with basic rate tax relief added that you need to put on the form is £875 (£700 divided by 80 and multiplied by 100). HMRC will then work out the extra tax relief due to you on top of the basic rate claimed by your pension provider.Be aware that there are slightlydifferent rules for Scotland.Remember child benefitIf you earn £60,000-plus and you or your partner claim child benefit, then this affects you (it doesn’t matter if the child living with you is not yours).The high income child benefit charge is a way for the amount paid to higher earners to be clawed back via the tax system on a sliding scale. For the 2024 to 2025 tax year, the earnings threshold at which this kicks in is £60,000 a year.It’s your “adjusted net income” that is important here. This is your total taxable income before any personal allowances, including things such as interest from savings and dividends from shares, minus things such as donations made to charity via gift aid and some pension contributions.You can use HMRC’schild benefit tax calculatorto get an estimate of your adjusted net income.Don’t forget crypto gainsHMRC is cracking down on tax evasion involving “cryptoassets”, includingdigital currenciessuch as bitcoin and ethereum, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).New rulesthat took effect on 1 January will make it harder for crypto investors to hide their gains from UK and overseas tax authorities. And, for the first time this year, the self-assessment tax return has a dedicated section to declare any gains and losses (boxes 13.1 to 13.8 on thecapital gains tax supplementary pages).View image in fullscreenHMRC is cracking down on tax evasion involving crypto assets, including digital currencies such as bitcoin.Photograph: Nathaniel Noir/AlamyIncludecharity donationsDonating throughgift aidmeans charities can claim an extra 25p for every £1 you give and if you are a higher-rate taxpayer you can also make a claim in your tax return.Let’s say you donate £100 to a charity. It claims gift aid to make your donation £125. You pay 40% tax, so you can personally claim back £25 (£125 x 20%).Remember to include any regular donations you make that are subject to gift aid, and to search emails and paperwork for one-off contributions that qualify.Watch out for scamsHMRC is urging people to “stay alert to potential scams” before the deadline. It recently warned that more than 4,800 self-assessment scams had been reported since February 2025.“If any emails, text messages or phone calls appear suspicious, don’t be lured into clicking on links or sharing your personal information – report it directly to HMRC,” says a spokesperson.View image in fullscreenHMRC has told people to beware self-assessment scams.Photograph: Kirill Ivanov/AlamyThe department says it will never ask for personal or financial information via text or email; contact customers by email, text or phone to inform them about a refund or ask them to claim one; or leave voicemails threatening legal action or arrest. Anyone who receives suspicious communications can forward emails to phishing@hmrc.gov.uk, and text messages to 60599.Check out these videosIf you need a bit of hand-holding,HMRC’s YouTube channeloffers help with your tax return courtesy of short “how to” videos.

If you feel trapped – you’re not aloneI hadn’t fully grasped how the idea of a better future sustained me – now I, like many others, find it difficult to be productiveTheresa MacPhailWed 14 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Jan 2026 08.42 ESTShareAnew yearis upon us. Traditionally, we use this time to look forward, imagine and plan.But instead, I have noticed that most of my friends have been struggling to think beyond the next few days or weeks. I, too, have been having difficulty conjuring up visions of a better future – either for myself or in general.I posted this insight onsocial mediain the final throes of 2025, and received many responses. A lot of respondents agreed – they felt like they were just existing, encased in a bubble of the present tense, the road ahead foggy with uncertainty. But unlike the comforting Buddhist principle of living in the present, the feeling of being trapped in the now was paralyzing us.I mentioned this to my therapist, Dr Steve Himmelstein, a clinical psychologist based in New York City who has been practicing for nearly 50 years. He assured me I was not alone. Most of his clients, he said, have “lost the future”.People are feeling overwhelmed and overstimulated, bombarded with bad news each day – global economic and political instability, the rising cost of living, job insecurity, severe weather events. This not only heightens anxiety but also makes it more difficult to keep going.How to make a habit actually stick: the small changes that worked for youRead moreI hadn’t fully grasped how much the idea of a better future sustained me – how it made life more livable, hardship more bearable and creativity possible. When I could readily imagine a world that was more just and healthy, it was easier to commit to long-term projects and to invest in the next generation. But in our current political and environmental context, that vision has grown hazier – and I, like many others, have found it much more difficult to be productive and plan for the future.When I asked Himmelstein if our current inability to think about the future is unique, he said it seems worse now than in the immediate aftermath of 9/11. He spoke to other psychologists in his peer group to gather their impressions.“Clients are less optimistic now and they don’t talk about the future that much,” Himmelstein reported back. “The consensus is that people don’t seem to feel that good about their lives now. There’s a lot of despair. I have a few clients who don’t really have plans anymore. And when I ask my clients about what they’re looking forward to, most have no answer. They’re not looking forward to things.”Himmelstein was one of the last students of famed psychologist Viktor Frankl, a concentration camp survivor, professor and author ofMan’s Search for Meaning. Himmelstein learned from Frankl that to survive and thrive, we need to believe in a stable, brighter tomorrow. During his darkest days, Frankl was able not only to accept the reality of the suffering around him, but to refocus his attention on the larger meaning of his life. It was this “tragic optimism” that protected him from losing all faith in the future.When I asked Himmelstein what Frankl might have thought about current events, he paused to reflect. “I think it would scare him,” he said, “like it’s scaring all of us.”How crisis affects our ideas of the futureHuman brains weren’t originally built for thinking about the future – and we’re still bad at it. If clients are struggling with this, Himmelstein asks them to daydream about their lives one or two years out in a more perfect world. “The future is their homework,” he said.But it’s not easy. Our biology is, in a sense, working against us.“From an evolutionary standpoint, we are not designed to be thinking about a very distant future,” said Dr Hal Hershfield, a psychologist and professor of marketing and behavioral decision-making at UCLA.In fact, we don’t really think about our future – we remember it, said Hershfield, who studies how humans think about time and how that influences our emotions and behaviors. When we daydream or envision ourselves at a later point, we essentially create a memory. We then use these memories to construct our ideas about the future. This process is called “episodic future thinking”; it supports our decision-making, emotional regulation and ability to plan.The type of radical uncertainty generated during times of crisis, where all the factors that might affect future events or outcomes are unknowable in advance, interferes with our ability to recall those futures. That makes it harder to predict what will happen and makes calculating accurate probabilities feel nearly impossible.Humans have been here before, Hershfield reminded me. For example, people living through the Cuban missile crisis had no clear way of knowing if they – or the world itself – would survive.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, 'Well Actually', then 'Read more on living a good life in a complex world,' then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say 'More from this section'“What feels very different in the present moment,” Hershfield said, “is that it feels like it’s coming from multiple fronts. It’s everything from political uncertainty in the US and elsewhere, health insecurity from the very fresh memory of a global pandemic, job insecurity from AI, geopolitical insecurity, to environmental insecurity.”All these crises are happening contemporaneously, and because they interact with each other, their effects pile up. Social scientists refer to these stacked crises as apolycrisis. During a polycrisis, radical uncertainty becomes rife.The lack of predictability creates more doubt about the future, which blocks our ability to imagine ourselves in it. Ina recent study, participants were asked to write down as many future possible events for themselves as they could. Those who were reminded that the future is uncertain produced 25% fewer possible events than control subjects and took much longer on the task. They also rated their thoughts as less reliable. Just thinking about uncertainty made it more difficult for them to remember all their hopes and plans.The prefrontal cortex – the part of the brain responsible for thinking about our future selves – is one of humankind’s last evolutionary additions, said Dr Daniel Gilbert, a professor of psychology at Harvard who studies how humans navigate the concept of time. Simply put, our species hasn’t been able to conceptualize the future for all that long.Gilbert has spent decades studying and writing about how bad we are at predicting the future and how our future selves will react to it.“One problem is that we don’t imagine events correctly,” Gilbert said. “The larger problem is that we don’t know who we will be when we are experiencing that event.”We rely on the idea of a stable, continuous future self to help us understand the present and to achieve a sense of greater purpose, making it easier to plan and make decisions, said Hershfield. We lean on the idea that the future will resemble the present, at least to some degree. Then we use our predictions to shape the present – for example, brushing our teeth to avoid cavities, planning dinner while we eat breakfast.It may be harder to plan when we feel insecure about what’s coming. In aseries of recent small studies, when people were reminded that the future is radically uncertain, it lowered their self-certainty as well as their feelings that life itself is meaningful.How other cultures have dealt with uncertainty amid crisisDr Daniel Knight, an anthropologist at the University of St Andrews, has been thinking about how humans understand the future for years. While doing fieldwork in Greece duringthe 2008-2010 debt crisis, he observed how people coped during an extended polycrisis.“Greece had a migration crisis, an energy crisis, an economic crisis,” Knight said. “I was working with people born in the 1980s and 1990s, who were born into stories about modernity and progress and a very capitalist idea of accumulation. And almost overnight, all of that was stripped from them.”Take on the new year with a motivational reboot … or hibernate. We can help with bothRead moreSuddenly, the future that Greek citizens had grown up believing was inevitable was no longer possible.Instead, Greeks looked to history for familiar scenarios and outcomes. “Almost overnight narratives switched from planning weddings and holidays, taking out loans, to talk of returning to times of hardship – particularly the1941 great famine,” said Knight.In response to the debt crisis, in 2010 the Greek government passed the first austerity bailout package – focused on drastic spending cuts and increased taxes. In response, people began making comparisons to life during the Axis occupation in te second world war. The comparisons helped people not only see that their current crisis could be overcome, but that a brighter future might emerge from it.Another coping mechanism involved recentering on much shorter timeframes. “Some of them hunkered down in the now,” Knight said. They refocused on themselves, immediate family and friends, only making short-term plans. Knight noticed that more people turned to their community for help in reimagining their lives, and in the process created what Knight calls micro-utopias. Cycling clubs sprang up everywhere, and people made more effort to spend time together.I recalled that something similar began to happen in New York City as we emerged from pandemic lockdowns. Friends and colleagues were joining community gardens or running clubs, organizing community programs and meetups, and volunteering.Knight is working on a book on Europe from 1644 to 1660, a time of great strife: the Great Plague, an economic crisis, the burning of Constantinople and London, fears of a new ice age, and a religious crisis in England. The end result of this turmoil was, as Knight said, “a more democratic form of governance and decentralized power, a spreading out of economic risk, and improved sanitation”.Importantly, Europeans learned to listen to their experts, and funneled more resources into their new universities to support science and the humanities. In sum, the polycrisis of the 1600s gave birth to the Enlightenment.It’s another reminder that we’re not so special and the times we’re in are not so unprecedented. “Our problems may be different now,” Knight said, “but there is still hope. We have a chance to choose which future we want. And depending on which version we choose, that transforms our actions today. We can make choices and collectively work towards that future.”How to get the future backIt may be hard to envision distant, positive outcomes amid a crisis, but that doesn’t mean they don’t exist. “We’d be foolish to stop planning,” said Hershfield. “We can still think about the values that are important to us and plan around them.” So if you know you want to support your child’s college education, for instance, you can still try to build up to that – as much as is possible during tough economic times.But it’s also important to be more flexible about those plans and have compassion for ourselves. Copious uncertainty from multiple directions can cause us to regret past choices, cautioned Hershfield. It’s not unusual for people to think about what they should have been doing 10, 20 or even 30 years ago to better prepare for this timeline. “That feeling can be paralyzing,” he said, “and it can make us just bury our heads in the sand.”When something isn’t working or an unexpected event knocks plans off course, it’s OK to shift gears. And if you’re feeling overwhelmed and anxious about what might happen, Hershfield suggests that it’s better to refocus on events that will most likely happen. This makes it easier to remember the future self we envisioned and plan accordingly.As a new year begins, it’s good to remember that we are more resilient than we think.“People are not the fragile flowers that a century of psychologists have made us out to be,” Gilbert said. “People who suffer real tragedy and trauma typically recover more quickly than they expect to and often return to their original level of happiness, or something close to it. That’s the good news – we are a hardy species, even though we don’t know this about ourselves.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyNew yearPsychologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Sometimes wearing more potent fragrances is impossible for those prone to allergies or migraines, but mostly it’s an instinctive aversion to being held captive all day by scent too pervasive for one’s liking. And in these instances, I invariably suggest the layering of two more subtly scented products with compatible aromas, to add depth and interest without the same strength as a power perfume.The result is a sort of olfactory watercolour painting – gentler, translucent, less defined and kinder to a scent-sensitive nose, easier to wear and more appropriate in some settings.Rare Beauty have run with this concept for its newLayering Balms, £18. There are four ungreasy balms to choose from: Woody Oak (my favourite), Amber Vanilla, Floral Peony Blossom and Bergamot, each created to stroke on to pulse points. They form a fragrant foundation on which to spray another scent – specifically,Rare’s own signature(£71), but I’ve experimented with others and they are versatile. The effect is longer-lasting without being overpowering and greater than the sum of its parts.It is a sort of olfactory watercolour painting: gentler, less defined and kinder to a scent-sensitive noseBody mist is another way to add depth and longevity to lighter scents without increasing potency. The new generation have more in common with cologne than with the school-changing-room sprays of yore. Salt & Stone do them particularly well. TheirSantal& Vetiver Body Mist(£45), for example, can be layered all over after the excellent matchingDeodorant stick(£20) orBody Lotion(£49), to the total exclusion of perfume if desired, and the warm, woody, very tasteful and gender-neutral scent will still carry throughout the day.Sali Hughes on beauty: fancy a fringe?

From my rocky perch atop Haystacks, I gazed down on Buttermere and Crummock Water glistening to the north, the round-shouldered hulks of Pillar and Great Gable looming to the south. A pair of ravens cronked indignantly, protesting against the intrusion on their eyrie; otherwise, stillness reigned.Bless you, Alfred Wainwright, I murmured, picturing the hiking legend whose ashes are scattered around this lonely tarn. And then, surprising myself: you too, Rishi Sunak. In very different ways, both had brought me to this most spectacular of Lakeland crags.Coast to Coast Wainwright walk map showing the routeIt’s a little over half a century since Wainwright, patron saint of fell walkers, sketched a line on the map linking the Cumbria and Yorkshire shores. Not, of course, at random.“The route follows an approximate beeline … from St Bees Head on the Irish Sea to Robin Hood’s Bay on the North Sea,” he wrote. “The grandest territory in the north of England is traversed by it; indeed, two-thirds of the route lies through the areas of three national parks.”Today Wainwright’sCoast to Coastpath is possibly Britain’s most popular multi-day trail, snaking more than 190 miles through the Lake District, Yorkshire Dales and North York Moors national parks. Curiously, though, it isn’t marked on OS Maps. Some stretches don’t even follow a public right of way. Yet.“Rishi Sunak, whose constituency encompasses the central part of the route, campaigned for its designation as a national trail,” explains Angela Hobson, Yorkshire Dales Coast to Coast project manager. “Previously there were issues with signposting, trail maintenance, even sections that didn’t have access formally agreed.”Crossing into the Dales, I ambled through fractured limestone pavement erupting through the turf like so many broken molarsNatural England, which administers national trails, announced the project in 2022, backed by £5.6m funding, to be completed “early 2026”. It involved a host of work – resolving legal issues of land access; upgrading and repairing paths, bridges and other infrastructure; improving signposting and waymarking with the distinctive acorn symbol; appointment of dedicated trail officers, and other aspects. But what practical difference will this status make – to walkers, to the environment, to local communities and businesses?To find out, I tackled the route – joined for some stretches by my partner Sarah – over 12 often exhilarating, sometimes exhausting days starting from St Bees, covering between 12 and 23 miles and bedding down in a different inn or B&B each night. The proof, after all, is in the plodding.View image in fullscreenThe writer on the route near Haystacks in the Lake District.Photograph: Sarah BaxterIt soon became clear that upgrades will probably be least palpable in the Lake District. Although some 6,000 tramp the route annually, contributing perhaps £7m to local economies, that’s a drop in the ocean for one of Britain’s most visited national parks, which welcomes close to 18 million visitors a year. Signposts are conspicuously absent on fell tops here, preserving the sense of wildness – and that looks unlikely to change. So the addition of green diamonds to the OS Map, indicating a waymarked route, will be a boon to those, like me, who are navigationally challenged. And there are other tangible infrastructure improvements.That became apparent on day one, as I descended the first real hill, Dent, down Raven Crag, where photogenically curly horned Herdwick sheep modelled obligingly. At the bottom I followed Nannycatch Beck, meandering through an elfin realm as magical as its name, beneath rowan and hawthorn, between sheer valley sides clad in bracken and coconut-scented gorse – and crossing pristine wooden footbridges to which subtle new Coast to Coast signs are affixed.The following day, I was grateful for repairs to trails around limpid Ennerdale Water and Honister Pass. Likewise in Wainwright’s favourite vale: “The Lake District is the loveliest part of England,” he proclaimed, “and Borrowdale is the fairest of its valleys.” Along the Derwent, here a babbling baby stream shaded by venerable oaks, the splendidly christened Willygrass Bridge has been renewed.View image in fullscreenEnnerdale Water in the Lake District.Photograph: Sarah BaxterCrossing into the Dales, I ambled through fractured limestone pavement erupting through the turf like so many broken molars. Once more, impacts of National Trail work were evident. “Many international guests have never experienced peat hag before,” notes Nick, who – with his partner Rachel – runs the fabulousOld Croft House B&Bin Kirkby Stephen, where I stayed, dishing up local lore, advice and slabs of luscious chocolate cake. “Sections of the path were so muddy, and saw so many walkers each year, that it became a quagmire 30 or 40 metres wide. Now old flagstones reclaimed from the region’s mills have been laid up to and across White Mossy Hill, making it accessible in pretty much all weathers. Some say they spoil the sense of wilderness, but they protect that fragile environment as well as making navigation easier.”Up towards the Brobdingnagian cairns on Nine Standards Rigg, I discovered a new long, snaking trail of heavy-duty stepping stones which protect precious peat and delicate moss ecosystems – and keep boots dry. Passing the route’s midway point, the postcard-pretty Swaledale village of Keld, and climbing on to the moor above Muker, past the ruins of gloriously named Crackpot Hall. Following the newly realigned path to the lead-mining relics around Swinner Gill and Gunnerside Gill, a concealed otherworld where the remains of pit buildings, channels and smelters only add to the enchantment.In this broadleaf Arcadia of mossy boulders and ferns, soaring cliffs, chiming birdsong and brook, I joined laughing families on stone pathsBeyond Richmond’s bulky castle (built by Alan the Red, my new favourite Norman), and fuelled by tea loaf topped with a wedge of creamy local wensleydale, I left the Dales to cross the flat agricultural Vale of Mowbray. Past Ingleby Cross, at the gateway to the North York Moors national park, the ascent through the silver birches and ferns of Scarth Wood is a welcome return to hillwalking, tracing the northern scarp of the Cleveland Hills. Improvements, from new National Trail signs to replacing stiles with gates, will benefit local people, not just long-distance hikers, North York Moors Coast to Coast project officer Bernie McLinden told me.View image in fullscreenPath improvements under way on White Mossy Hill.Photograph: Paul BloomfieldPerhaps the loveliest example came in Little Beck Wood on my final day, following May Beck to the waterfall of Falling Foss. In this broadleaf Arcadia of mossy boulders and ferns, soaring shale cliffs, chiming birdsong and melodious brook, I joined laughing families on stone paths laboriously laid by Bernie and volunteers, replacing slippery boardwalks. A few miles out from Robin Hood’s Bay and journey’s end, I recalled Angela’s words.“I took my daughter up to White Mossy Hill and said to her: ‘You’ll be able to walk over this with your children, and they’ll be able to walk over it with their grandchildren,’” she beamed. “‘And I helped build it.’” Wainwright’s legacy, refreshed.The trip was provided byMacs Adventure, which offers various Coast to Coast holidays, including a14-day itinerary (12 days’ walking) from £1,579including B&B accommodation, luggage transfers and route info.

The 55-year-old had not cried since he was a boy, but as he dismantled the family home and prepared to flee the village where his whole life had played out, he was overwhelmed by grief.While Eshaq’s children loaded mattresses, a fridge, sacks of flour and suitcases of clothes into a truck, masked soldiers escorted a teenage Israeli shepherd down the main village road, where he posed for photos on his donkey, flashing a V sign.The ethnic cleansing of Ras ‘Ein al ‘Auja was underway, and the men and boys who made life untenable for Palestinians here had come to celebrate.View image in fullscreenThe Israeli settler shepherd, escorted by a white truck with Israeli soldiers.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianEshaq’s home, a community of about 135 families, was the largest and most established of the Bedouin villages dotted on hillsides in this part of the Jordan valley.By the start of this year, it was also the only one left. A campaign of intensifying settler violence – arson, mass theft, beatings, intimidation and destruction of property – forced out village after village until their last remaining neighbours, in nearby Mu’arrajat, fled in July.Israeli settlers now have full control of more than 250 sq km (100 sq miles) of land in this part of the occupiedWest Bank, where a decade ago only Bedouin herds grazed, said Dror Etkes, founder of settlement monitoring group Kerem Navot.Palestinians have been forced out of this area, which the international community has earmarked as part of their future state.“We were living here peacefully, but they made us into an enemy. The settlers brought the violence,” Eshaq said. “I haven’t cried my whole life, but this morning I was crying. This is a terrible day for us.”He grew up gazing across the Jordan river at mountains rising sharply toward white hilltop towns, and splashing in the wadi where his children and grandchildren later played. At night the clear desert skies are crowded with stars.The bedouin families who live there are descendants of refugees forced out of the Naqab, or Negev, in what is now Israel, in 1948. Poor, isolated and with little political influence even within Palestinian society, they are relatively easy targets for settlers.The project to push them out of their homes began before the war in Gaza but gathered speed and strength as political and media attention focused elsewhere.“When the war started settler leadership understood they had an unprecedented opportunity to step up ethnic cleansing for the area,” Sarit Michaeli, international director of rights group B’Tselem.“The midterm goal is to remove Palestinians from all the open land in the West Bank, and they are doing this with the full participation of the Israeli government. The settler maps make clear that ultimately they want to empty the land of Palestinians.”The campaign of forced displacement here is run from small outposts where teenage boys and a few adults manage flocks of sheep, goats and camels.Taking land by building homes and communities on it is slow and expensive. Taking control of large swathes of dry hills by bringing in animals and using them to intimidate, isolate and bar Palestinians is much more efficient.MapThe foot soldiers in this war of Israeli expansion are young men, including minors sent to outposts by the state under a programme for at-risk youth.“In recent years, the Jewish shepherds have continued to conquer more and more territory,” read one message in a settler WhatsApp group celebrating the forced displacement of a village last year.“With all due respect to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], the critical and decisive work of Jewish settlement and the expulsion of the enemy is done by those 15- to 16-year old boys, the ‘Hilltop Youth’.”But if the tools are unsophisticated, the project is anything but. The boys in jeans and slogan T-shirts are part of a state-funded, state-backed project, deploying violence with near total impunity.Settlers attack Palestinians using all terrain vehicles and other equipment handed out at public ceremonies by politicians including the far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, himself a settler.Security forces in the occupied West Bank have resources and time to cull hundreds of crocodiles on arogue farm, but not to protect Palestinians.In Ras ‘Ein al ‘Auja, security forces regularly arrest Israeli peace activists and Palestinians, but either ignore settler violence in the area, or support it.Last year when a courtorderedthe army to coordinate the return of Palestinians driven out of neighbouring Mu’arrajat, the soldiers only stayed a few hours. When they left settlers descended, driving residents out again.View image in fullscreenPalestinians prepare to leave their home in the Jordan valley.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianIn the two years since October 2023, Israeli soldiers and settlers have killed over 1,000 Palestinians across the occupied West Bank, one in five of them children. No one has been tried or convicted for any of these deaths.Last year, settlers beat an American citizen to death, prompting US senators to warn there wasno accountabilityfor Palestinian lives, and shot a prominent activist on camera.The Israeli military recorded a 25% increase in settler violence last year, Haaretz reported, much of it attributed to larger and better organised groups getting support from politicians and well-known activists.Tipping pointIn the new year, violence reached a tipping point for some families in Ras ‘Ein al ‘Auja, after settlers cut several houses off by ploughing up a dirt track and established a makeshift outpost inside the village.They roamed between houses at night severing electricity cables, emptying water tanks and pushing into rooms filled with sleeping women and children.Last Thursday, 26 families, more than 120 people, decided the risk of staying outweighed the pain and cost of leaving. Most lived on the edge of the village and their departure left Eshaq’s family effectively on the frontline.Looping video of people loading their belongings on to a truck“This week we haven’t eaten and haven’t slept,” he said. It only took a couple of days before he also concluded staying was too dangerous. The children at least were relieved, after the terror of the settler home invasions“They want to go right now, straight away,” said Rawan, 24, holding nine-month old Yacoub, as her four-year-old son Mousa played nearby.Neighbour Mohammed Reshad was packing up as well after a night raid by settlers who stole clothes and mattresses. “They took things from me and my two sisters,” said his nine-year old granddaughter Jana.The truck cost 1,800 shekels (£425) to hire, a small fortune here, and they are still debating where to go. “Is there anyone who will protect me from the settlers? If there is, I will stay,” he said.Each family that packs up leaves those who stay even more vulnerable. Na’ef Ja’alin, a 50-year-old father of 10, is still in his home out of desperation, not hope.“The ones who have left have family who can give them a plot of land. Me and my brothers have no place to go,” he said. “I have no money, and land is very expensive.”Mainstream supportView image in fullscreenViolence has reached a tipping point for many Palestinian families in Ras ‘Ein al ‘Auja.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianThe project to displace Palestinians is being carried out by violent extremists backed by far-right cabinet ministers. But annexation of this area is a long-standing, mainstream project in Israel, backed by politicians across party lines.Yigal Allon, then a cabinet minister from the secular Labor party, laid out an initial plan soon after Israel seized the West Bank in 1967. He wanted Israel to hold on to a strip of land along the Jordan valley to serve as a security buffer.The CIA described the plan as inflammatory and impractical but noted that the government was already putting some elements in place. “Israel unrealistically feels that the Allon plan is a workable solution to the problems of the occupied territories and has implemented some of its features,” a now declassifiedmemowarned.The plan was never officially adopted but has persisted in Israeli political imagination, helped perhaps by the fact that two Israeli roads roughly delineate Allon’s land grab plans.The strip of territory he wanted for Israel – and which includes Ras ‘Ein al ‘Auja – now lies between highway 90 near the Jordanian border and the “Allon Road” that twists and turns along the mountain ridges down the centre of the West Bank.On official maps this highway is labelled with a jumble of route numbers – 458, 508, and 578 – but all Israelis know it as the Allon Road.The hills that slope down to the river Jordan are sparsely populated, semi-desert land, too dry for agriculture but suitable for grazing. Settler herding outposts have proved a particularly efficient instrument for mass dispossession here.Last May, settler leader Elisha Yered celebrated the destruction of another village here as a template for the wider West Bank.“This is what redemption looks like!” he posted on social media after the people of Mughayyir al-Deir fled. “God willing, one day we will force you [Palestinians] to the places you belong, in Iraq and Saudi Arabia.”Amappublished by a settler news outlet to mark that displacement showed the village within an aspirational Israeli-controlled area covering nearly 400 sq km, an area bigger than Gaza.Across the West Bank, settlers have seized over 18% of the land designated for a future Palestinian state, said Etkes, with very few repercussions.Canada, France, the UK and other European countries imposed sanctions on violent settlers and last year recognised a Palestinian state, but the obliteration of Palestinian communities on the ground only continues to gather speed.“The culprits are so well known, not just the violent settlers but the instigators, the officials who are enabling and funding this forcible transfer,” said Michaeli. “But unfortunately I think we are much further from any sort of international accountability than ever.”Explore more on these topicsMiddle East and north AfricaWest BankPalestineIsraelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After a local backlash, the teenagers werereleasedon Tuesday.Since the unprecedented US ground attack on a South American country, a state of emergency has been in force in Venezuela, ordering the “immediate search and capture of anyone involved in the promotion or support of the US armed attack”.“This kind of power reshuffle produces so much administrative chaos and a lack of a clear chain of command,” said Zair Mundaray, the former Venezuelan senior prosecutor. “[The regime] is seeking to project a very civic image, releasing some people, while others are being jailed at the same time,” he added.On Tuesday, Jorge Rodríguez said that the regime was carrying out a “mass process of releases” that he claimed already amounted to more than 400 people – on Wednesday, his sister said the figure had reached 406 – a figure that includes two rounds of releases carried out before Maduro’s capture, on Christmas Day and New Year’s Day.NGOs monitoring political detentions, however, say fewer releases have so far been independently verified.The organisation Justicia, Encuentro y Perdón, for example,confirmedonly 157 of the 186 releases announced earlier, and 100 of the 116 that Rodríguez claimed had taken place since last week.NGOs estimate that there are still close to 1,000 political prisoners in Venezuela and are demanding the release of all of them, fully and without conditions. Charges remain in place against many of those who have so far been freed, who are also barred from making public statements.A US state department spokesperson said in a brief statement on Tuesday: “We welcome the release of detained Americans in Venezuela. This is an important step in the right direction by the interim authorities.”There was no confirmation, however, of how many US citizens were released, although the number is estimated to beat least four.In posts on his social media accounts, Trump said the release of prisoners had led him to cancel a second wave of attacks. Last Saturday, he wrote: “I hope those prisoners will remember how lucky they got that the USA came along and did what had to be done. I HOPE THEY NEVER FORGET! If they do, it will not be good for them.”Meanwhile, Reutersreportedthat the White House had filed for court warrants to seize dozens more tankers linked to Venezuela’s oil trade, though it remains unclear how many seizure warrants the US has sought and how many it has already obtained.The US military and coast guard have seized five vessels in recent weeks in international waters that were either carrying Venezuelan oil or had done so in the past.On Thursday, Donald Trump is due to receive Venezuela’s main opposition leader and Nobel peace prize winner, María Corina Machado, at the White House. Many had expected her to take charge of the country after Maduro’s fall, but she was sidelined by the US president, who instead chose to keep the former dictator’s entire cabinet in place.Bloombergreportedthat the acting president, Rodríguez, will send a representative to Washington – on the same day as Machado’s visit – to meet senior US officials: Félix Plasencia, the current head of mission at the Venezuelan embassy in London and a former foreign minister.Venezuela and the US resumed talks last week on reopening embassies in both countries.Also in an apparent effort to appear more open, Rodríguez and the powerful interior minister, Diosdado Cabello – whocontrolsmuch of the regime’s apparatus of repression –returnedto Xon Tuesday, more than a year after Maduro censored the social media platform. It remains unclear whether the ban has been lifted for all Venezuelans, who had been forced to use VPNs to access the social media platform.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaNicolás MaduroUS attack on VenezuelaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Key ministers and allies have stepped down and polling suggests his government faced long odds of re-election in the fall. Some polls suggested the party, which won majority governments in 2018 and 2022, could lose all seats in the upcoming election.Within the province, the CAQ has faced intense backlash over a law changing how doctors in the province are paid, an uproar that cost Legault his health minister, Christian Dubé. And a snowballing scandal over the province’s attempts to modernize an online portal for license renewals and vehicle registration has been plagued with cost overruns in the hundreds of millions of dollars, prompting a public inquiry. The cybersecurity minister, Éric Caire, resigned in February 2025.More broadly, the government has courted controversy by pursuing secularism as a key legislative priority.In August, the CAQsaid it would ban public prayer, a move that civil rights groups said was “alarming” and targets religious minority groups, infringing on their “basic democratic freedoms”. Years before, in 2019, the government passedBill 21,which bars judges, police officers, prison guards and teachers from wearing religious symbols while at work. Other public workers such as bus drivers, doctors and social workers must only keep their faces uncovered. That law runs afoul of both Quebec’s charter of human rights and freedoms and Canada’s charter of rights and freedoms.The CAQ has alsogone to warover the creep of the anglophone culture in the province, passing sweeping French language protections that reshaped key aspects of public life in the province. In 2022, Legault said he was “proud to be a francophone nation in North America”, adding it was his government’s “duty to protect our common language”.Legault also clashed with the federal government over immigration and refugee resettlement. In April, Quebec’s immigration minister, Jean-François Roberge, said thatQuebeccannot “welcome all the world’s misery” amid an influx of asylum seekers, many of whom came from Haiti.“The problem isn’t the Haitians, it’s not the immigrants, it’s the number,” Legault said at the time. During his resignation, the outgoing premier said Quebecers “must not be embarrassed about protecting our values”.Legault’s departure is the second in many months, after the resignation of the Quebec Liberal leader, Pablo Rodriguez. The former federal cabinet minister stepped down only half a year into the job following allegations of vote-buying by party members during his leadership race. Rodriguez has denied any wrongdoing.With both the CAQ and the Liberals in search of a new leader, the nationalist Parti Québécois currently leads the province’s polling. Leader Paul St-Pierre Plamondon has pledged to bring a third referendum on separation fromCanadaif the party wins in November.Explore more on these topicsQuebecCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

When I went to see what had happened, I found the crane sitting on a passenger train with three carriages.“The metal from the crane appeared to strike the middle of the second carriage, slicing it in half.”The health ministry said 32 people were dead and 64 had been hospitalised, seven in a serious condition.View image in fullscreenA train travelling from Bangkok to Ubon Ratchathani lies damaged after being derailed.Photograph: Thai transport ministry/ReutersThe crash happened at a construction site that is part of a $5.4bn project backed by Beijing to build a high-speed rail network in Thailand. It aims to connect Bangkok to Kunming in China via Laos by 2028 as part of China’s vast belt and road infrastructure initiative.Live footage aired by local media showed rescue workers at the scene and a brightly coloured train derailed on its side.The district police chief, Thatchapon Chinnawong, said authorities were pausing the rescue operation because of “chemical leakage” at the scene.The transport minister, Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn, said 195 people had been onboard and authorities were trying to identify the dead.The prime minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, said authorities must determine the cause of the crane collapse and hold anyone responsible to account.“These kind of incidents happen very regularly,” he told reporters in Bangkok. “I have heard that it is the same company [involved as in previous accidents]. It is time to change the law to blacklist construction companies that are repeatedly responsible for accidents.”View image in fullscreenRescue workers attend the scene of the disaster.Photograph: APThailand has about 3,100 miles (5,000km) of railway but the run-down state of the network has long driven people to favour travel by road.Upon completion of the 370-mile high-speed railway, Chinese-made trains will run from Bangkok to Nong Khai, on the Mekong River border with Laos, at up to 150mph.Industrial and construction site accidents are common in Thailand and lax enforcement of safety regulations can lead to deaths.Explore more on these topicsThailandTrain crashesAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 3.0% increase.Imports were up 5.7% after a 1.9% bump the month earlier and also beat a forecast for a 0.9% uptick.China’s yuanheld steady after the upbeat data even as equity investors welcomed the forecast-beating numbers. The benchmark Shanghai Composite index and blue-chip CSI300 index both rose more than 1% in morning deals.The Chinese monthly export surpluses exceeded $100bn seven times last year – partially underpinned by a weakened yuan – up from just once in 2024, underscoring that Trump’s actions have barely dented China’s trade with the wider world even if he has curbed US-bound shipments.Economists expect China to continue gaining global market share this year, helped by Chinese firms setting up overseas production hubs that provide lower-tariff access to the US and EU, as well as by strong demand for lower-grade chips and other electronics.China’s car making industrysaw overall exports jump 19.4% to 5.79m vehicles last year, with pure EV shipments up 48.8%. China would probably remain the world’s top auto exporter for a third year after first beating Japan in 2023.Beijing, however, has shown signs of recognising it must moderate its industrial exports if it is to sustain its success, and the leadership has been increasingly cognisant and vocal about imbalances in China’s economy and the image problem its export volumes are causing.After November’s trillion-dollar surplus data, the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, was quoted last week on national television as calling for “proactively expanding imports and promoting the balanced development of imports and exports”.China also scrapped subsidy-like export tax rebates for its solar industry, a longstanding point of friction with EU states.Lawmakers in December passed revisions to the foreign trade law after two rather than the usual three readings, in a signal to members of a major trans-Pacific trade pact that China is prepared to shift from industrial subsidies towards freer, more open trade.Despite the year-long truce on tariffs that Trump and the Chinese president,Xi Jinping, struck in late October, US duties of 47.5% on Chinese goods are well above the roughly 35% level analysts say enables Chinese firms to export to the US at a profit.Explore more on these topicsChinaEconomic policyXi JinpingTrump tariffsAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The court is due to deliver its verdict on 19 February.View image in fullscreenYoon Suk Yeol was formally removed from office in April.Photograph: Ahn Young-joon/APProsecutors demanded life imprisonment with labour for the former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun, describing him as having “moved as one body” with Yoon throughout the conspiracy.Yoon deployed troops to the national assembly on the night of 3 December 2024, allegedly ordering them toprevent lawmakersfrom voting to lift his martial law declaration.The six-hour crisis ended when 190 MPs broke through military cordons to pass an emergency resolution, forcing Yoon to back down. Parliamentimpeached himon 14 December, and the constitutional courtremoved himfrom office in April 2025.A snap election brought Yoon’s rival, Lee Jae Myung,to power.Prosecutors told the court Yoon began planning the operation before October 2023 to “monopolise power through long-term rule”, strategically placing military personnel in key positions before the declaration.According to their closing arguments the plans, documented in notebooks and mobile phone memos, included preparing to torture election officials into confessing to fabricated election fraud, and cutting power and water to critical media outlets.“If just one [cabinet member] had informed the outside world … the implementation of martial law would have been realistically impossible,” prosecutors said, condemning senior officials who “chose loyalty to Yoon and greed for power-sharing”, threatening people’s lives and freedom.They cited Yoon’s complete lack of remorse as a key aggravating factor, noting he has never properly apologised and instead blames the then-opposition while inciting supporters. Some of those supportersstormed a courthousein violent protests following his arrest.View image in fullscreenSupporters of Yoon Suk Yeol have protested outside his trial.Photograph: Lee Jin-man/APYoon, a former prosecutor general, was fully aware the declaration was unconstitutional, they said.In a statement, the presidential office said the judiciary would deliver a verdict in accordance with laws and principles, and in line with the public’s expectations.The case marks the first insurrection-related charges against a former president since the 1996 trial of military dictatorsChun Doo-hwanand Roh Tae-woo for their roles in the 1979 coup and subsequentmassacre in Gwangju.Prosecutors then demanded death for Chun and life imprisonment for Roh. Both were convicted, though their sentences were later reduced and they were ultimately pardoned.South Korea has not executed anyone since 1997 and is classified as a “de facto abolitionist” state by human rights groups.Yoon was firstarrested in January 2025, making him the first sitting Korean president to be taken into custody. He wasbriefly releasedin March after a court cancelled his detention, but wasre-arrested in Julyand has been held since.The insurrection case represents just one piece of an unprecedented legal onslaught.Three concurrent special prosecutor probes into Yoon, his wife, and the allegedcover-up of a marine’s deathhave indicted more than 120 people across the political and military establishment.Yoon faces eight separate criminal trials spanning charges from abuse of power to election law violations.Beyond the insurrection charge, he is accused of orderingdrone infiltrationsinto Pyongyang airspace in late 2024 to provoke North Korea and create a pretext for martial law.His wife, Kim Keon Hee,faces her own reckoningon 28 January, when another Seoul court will rule on stock manipulation andbribery chargescarrying a prosecutorial demand of 15 years imprisonment.Yoon’s first verdict arrives on 16 January in hisarrest obstruction case, where prosecutors have demanded 10 years imprisonment.Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaYoon Suk YeolAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The Forestry Corporation’s own surveys detected just four den trees in the area.If the citizen scientists’ results are correct, it raises questions about whether logging can go ahead.View image in fullscreenFormer NSW environment minister Bob Debus accused the NSW Forestry Corporation of breaching its own regulations so frequently that the ‘practice is essentially part of its business model’.Photograph: Mike Bowers/The GuardianAndrew Wong, the operations manager of Wilderness Australia who led the team of volunteers, warned the NSWFC could be “committing ecological fraud” if they continued conducting forestry operations. He accused them of surveying the bare minimum and claiming there are fewer gliders there than there actually are.Debus said the operations at Glenbog showed that native forest logging in NSW was untenable.“Forestry Corp is in breach of its own regulations so frequently that the practice is effectively part of its business model,” he said.“Native forestry operations run at a permanent loss so in reality, taxpayers are paying the fines when they are prosecuted.”Glenbog, near the Deua national park, is a hotspot for greater gliders and other threatened species because it is a cloud forest with its own microclimate, making it less prone to extreme temperatures.Wong said his group of volunteers identified large hollows in old trees during daytime and then waited until dusk to detect gliders as they emerged from their dens.“There is just a small window when they emerge, just as it gets dark,” Wong said.Using thermal cameras and spotlights, the volunteers recorded each greater glider sighting and uploaded them to a phone app which then geolocated it on a map. The data was also sent to the government site BioNet, he said.View image in fullscreenWilderness Australia says Forestry Corporation is still conducting many surveys outside the time when greater gliders emerge at dusk.Photograph: Heidi LincolnUntil recently, the Forestry Corporation was surveying during the day. After a court ruled this was inadequate, they moved to surveying at dusk and night.Wong claimed the NSWFC was still conducting many of its surveys outside the crucial window when gliders emerged, and the survey methods failed to consider hollows on the other side of trees or deeper in the forest.“Glenbog is a biodiversity stronghold that should never be logged,” Wong said.The agriculture minister, Tara Moriarty, who is responsible for forestry, said she expected the corporation “to undertake native forest operations in line with the requirements of the Coastal Integrated Forestry Operations Approvals”.“This provides very specific instructions on searching for greater glider dens and I am advised that Forestry Corporation has comprehensive procedures in place to adhere to these requirements.”A Forestry Corporation spokesperson said the conditions of approval had specific parameters for nocturnal searches to be conducted for greater gliders.“The [conditions specify] the time of day, location of surveys relative to roads and trails and the speed at which the surveys must take place. Forestry Corporation conducts nocturnal surveys in line with these requirements.NSW forestry agency should be shut down for repeatedly breaking law, critics argueRead more“Information provided to Forestry Corporation by third parties is also considered in the planning process and exclusion zones established around den sightings,” it said.“The records provided by the citizen scientists are currently being incorporated into the plan.”However, the rules are minimum requirements for inspections and it is open to Forestry to do more.The area is also home to many wombats, including those that have been rescued and rehabilitated at the neighbouring wildlife sanctuary.The sanctuary made an informal agreement with the NSWFC not to damage wombat burrows during logging, afteran incident in 2014when burrows were destroyed during forestry operations, leading to entrances being squashed by machinery and blocked by felled timber.Marie Wynan, the founder of the sanctuary, said a lot of the wombats were ones it had released. “They don’t deserve to be buried alive.”She said 666 burrows have been identified.The NSWFC said it was working with the wildlife sanctuary to avoid damaging burrows.Explore more on these topicsNew South Wales politicsLogging and land-clearingTrees and forestsWildlifeNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

It would make it a crime to associate with, recruit, train, or provide support for a designated group, with an individual found guilty of “intentionally” directing the activities of a listed hate group facing up to 15 years in jail.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailBurgess, who under the proposed law could make a recommendation to the home affairs minister to designate an organisation as a hate group, has said the NSN and Hizb ut-Tahrir are two concerning groups that “know how to stay on the right side of the law as the laws currently are”, and do not currently meet the higher terrorist listing threshold.Hizb ut-Tahrir was founded in Jordan in 1953. Its official aim is to re-establish the Islamic caliphate and impose sharia law worldwide.It has been a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK, Germany and India.Announcing the UK banin January 2024, the then home secretary, James Cleverly, said: “Hizb ut-Tahrir is an antisemitic organisation that actively promotes and encourages terrorism, including praising and celebrating the appalling 7 October attacks.”What is ‘antisemitic’ Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir and what does it want?Read moreBurke said no Australian government had been able to ban the group as it didn’t meet the “violence threshold”, and “that’s why the government is lowering the threshold”.A lawyer acting on behalf of Hizb ut-Tahrir Australia, Zaid Hamdan El Madi, said if the legislation passes his clients would “do what any organisation in a democracy is entitled to do” and “carefully review the final act, seek detailed legal advice, and, if necessary, challenge any listing through the courts”.“Hizb ut-Tahrir is based on an Islamic political worldview. Unless the government is proposing to ban Islamic ideas, it cannot ban the ideas of Hizb ut-Tahrir,” he said.“Hizb ut-Tahrir has never advocated hate or violence based on racial identity, its views are political in nature.”On Saturday, Hamdan El Madi sent a letter on behalf of Hizb ut-Tahrir Australia to Burke, the prime minister,Anthony Albanese, and the attorney general, Michelle Rowland, questioning whether such a law could be unconstitutional.During a press conference on the same day, Rowland said: “We have crafted this legislation in a way that’s robust and we understand, of course, that these are laws that may be challenged … But the government stands by our drafting.”The NSN announced on Tuesday it would disband by Sunday, a day before the legislation is introduced to parliament.Jack Eltis, the NSW leader of the NSN, told Guardian Australia that the group has “no intention” to rebrand or circumvent the law if it passes, saying “national socialism will have to be pursued via parliamentarianism in future”.On Wednesday, an Islamic prayer hall in Sydney associated with the controversial cleric Wisam Haddad, which had come under scrutiny since the Bondi massacre,announced it would permanently close. It has no connection with Hizb ut-Tahrir.Burke told Guardian Australia on Wednesday that “the mere knowledge of the legislation” had already “seen the neo-Nazis disband”.He also claimed it had affected the decision by the Sydney prayer hall to announce its closure.Asked during a parliamentary committee examining the legislation on Tuesday whether the NSN disbanding would lead to it going underground, Burgess said it was a possibility.“Yes, there is a risk they go underground, but our job is to find the people who are hiding themselves in society, and we’re good at that … Of course, individuals don’t cease to exist, they’re still there in society and obviously the problematic ones we will continue to watch if they continue to be problematic,” Burgess said.Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsLabor partyAnthony AlbanesenewsShareReuse this content"

You found that out last week with Venezuela,” he added.The Danish foreign minster said earlier on Wednesday that Trump remains intent on “conquering” Greenland as the talks with US officials failed to solve a “fundamental disagreement” that has led to unprecedented tensions between Washington and a Nato ally.It was “absolutely not necessary” for the US to seize Greenland, a largely self-governing part of the Danish kingdom, the Danish foreign minster, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, said late on Wednesday.“We didn’t manage to change the American position. It’s clear that the president has this wish of conquering Greenland. And we made it very, very clear that this is not in the interest of the kingdom.”Rasmussen urged Washington to engage in “respectful” cooperation over the Arctic island that is controlled by Copenhagen.In a signal of European support, France, Germany and Norway have all said they would contribute troops to a multinational force led by Denmark that would lead to “an increased military presence in and around Greenland, comprising aircraft, vessels and soldiers, including from Nato allies”, the Danish defence ministry has said in a statement.The two sides did agree to create a working group to discuss ways to work through differences as Trump continues to call for a US takeover of the semi-autonomous territory of Nato ally Denmark.“The group, in our view, should focus on how to address the American security concerns, while at the same time respecting the red lines of the Kingdom of Denmark,” Rasmussen told reporters after joining Greenland’s foreign minister, Vivian Motzfeldt, for the talks.The closely watched talks on Trump’s demands to take over Greenland ended in Washington after nearly an hour.The vice-president, JD Vance, and secretary of state,Marco Rubio, hosted the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland on Wednesday in what observers worried could be an ambush meant to pressure the Danes into ceding the territory under US economic and military pressure.Earlier, Trump said it would be “unacceptable” for Greenland to be “in the hands” of any country other than the US, reiterating his demand to take over the island hours before the high-stakes talks on its future.“The US needs Greenland for the purpose of national security. Nato should be leading the way for us to get it,” the US president saidon social media. The alliance would become “far more formidable and effective” with the territory under US control, he claimed.“It is vital for the Golden Dome that we are building,” he said, referring to a proposed missile defence system.View image in fullscreenTrump disembarking from Air Force One on Tuesday. He has said the US ‘needs Greenland’.Photograph: Luis M Alvarez/APExpert reports suggested it could cost the US as much as $700bn (£520bn) to take over the territory, according to US media, and European officials have played down the likelihood of a direct American attack to take control of the island.As the two sides met, the Danish defence minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, said the country would establish a “more permanent” and larger military presence in Greenland and that it was “highly hypothetical” the US would launch an attack to take the territory.During the talks, the White House continued its social media offensive against its Nato ally, depicting two dogsleds headed toward either the US or Russia and China, with the caption: “Which way, Greenland man?” Trump had previously said Denmark’s defence of the territory was composed of “two dogsleds”.Trump first raised the idea of a takeover of Greenland in 2019, during his first term, but has ramped up his rhetoric significantly since returning to the White House last year, saying the USwould take it “one way or the other”.He has jolted the EU andNatoby refusing to rule out military force to seize the strategically important, mineral-rich island, which is covered by many of the protections offered by the two organisations because Denmark belongs to both.Rasmussen and Motzfeldt initially sought the talks with Rubio but the meeting took place at the White House after Vance asked to attend and then to host the talks.Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly pointed out that a 1951 bilateral agreement already allowed the US to vastly expand its military presence on the island.Several EU leaders have backed Denmark,pledging theirsupport for its territorial integrity and right to self-determination. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said on Wednesday that the island “belongs to its people”.“For me, it’s important that the Greenlanders know and they know this by the deeds, not only by the words, that we respect the wishes of the Greenlanders and their interests and that they can count on us,” she said in Brussels.France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said that if “the sovereignty of an EU country and ally were to be affected, the knock-on effects would be unprecedented”. France would “act in full solidarity with Denmark and its sovereignty”, he said.Greenland’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen,told a joint press conferencewith his Danish counterpart, Mette Frederiksen, on Tuesday that the island would not be owned or governed by Washington.“If we have to choose between the US and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark, Nato and the EU,” Nielsen said, adding that Greenland’s “goal and desire is peaceful dialogue, with a focus on cooperation”.Frederiksen said it had not been easy for Denmark to “stand up to completely unacceptable pressure from our closest ally” but the fact was that “borders cannot be changed by force, and that small countries should not fear large countries”.A Reuters/Ipsos poll on Wednesday found just 17% of Americans approved of Trump’s efforts to take over Greenland and that substantial majorities of both Democrats and Republicans opposed using military force to annex the island.Only 4%, including just one in 10 Republicans and almost no Democrats, said military force would be a “good idea”.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandUS foreign policyDenmarkJD VanceMarco RubioDonald TrumpEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

They stressed that “any attempt to undermine the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Denmark and Greenland, violates international law and the United Nations Charter.” They added that “the security of the Arctic is a strategic priority for the European Union, and we are firmly committed to safeguarding it,” calling for “reinforcing European defence capabilities” to ensure security in the Arctic region.ShareUpdated at15.34 EST"

He wrote on X: “I not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.”Nearly two weeks ago, the AI tool itself said it had generated “images depicting minors in minimal clothing” when questioned by users.There has been a flood of reports in recent weeks that Grok users are taking pictures of women or children found online and using the xAI bot to undress them virtually, Bonta said.Grok’s image generation models include what xAI promotes as a “spicy mode” for generating and editing sexual material, including pictures, according to the attorney general’s office.Last week, an analysis of more than 20,000 Grok-generated images by Paris non-profit AI Forensics found that more than half depicted “individuals in minimal attire” – most of them women, and 2% appearing to be under-18s.Images generated by Grok are being used to harass public figures as well as typical social media users, according to Bonta.Elon Musk’s stubborn spin on Grok’s sexualized images controversyRead moreThree Democratic US senators called on Apple and Google to remove the apps for X and Grok from their app stores last week in response to the flood of sexualized images.

Violent and hate-inciting tactics have no place in our territory.”The 10 people who have been banned have not been named and the actions that led to the ban have not been specified.The high number of asylum seekers arriving in the UK on small boats has fuelled anti-migrant rhetoric and harassment from the far right. In 2025 41,000 people crossed the Channel, the second highest annual total on record since crossings started in 2018.Both Ukip, which describes itself as “new right”, and Raise the Colours, which has been linked to the widespread hoisting of union jack and England flags across the country, have travelled to northern France and livestreamed footage of themselves harassing asylum seekers waiting to cross the Channel.Raise the Colours said the ban by the French authorities was “absolutely disgraceful”. A spokesperson said: “Raise the Colours is aware of public statements made today by the French interior ministry referring to administrative measures relating to certain individuals identified as members of Raise the Colours.“At the time of issuing this statement, no formal notification has been received by Raise the Colours regarding any administrative measures. We understand that the statements refer to administrative decisions concerning specific individuals, rather than the organisation as a whole.”They added: “Raise the Colours has always maintained that its activities must remain peaceful and within the law. The organisation does not support violence or any unlawful activity. Our approach is founded on responsibility, restraint and compliance with legal frameworks.“This commitment is reflected in the structured recruitment and screening process we have put in place, designed to ensure discipline, appropriate conduct and adherence to the law by anyone associated with Raise the Colours.”French authorities have previously opened an investigation into an alleged “aggravated assault” on people in a coastal area near Dunkirk in September.Four men carrying British and English flags allegedly verbally and physically assaulted a group of people in Grand-Fort-Philippe, telling them they were not welcome in England.In one video posted in November, a man filmed himself on a French beach, saying he had found a small inflatable boat buried in the sand and had cut it. “That is not going to England,” said the man.In another post published earlier in November, the same man waded into the sea in France, shouting at people boarding an inflatable dinghy hoping to get to the UK. “You’re not welcome in our country,” he said, calling the passengers “potential rapists, murderers and child abusers”.Georgie Laming, the director of campaigns at Hope Not Hate, welcomed the news. “The Raise the Colours team have been harassing both migrants and charity workers in northern France for months,” she said.“With a recent recruitment drive intended to bring more people from the UK to France, there couldn’t be a more apt time to stop this harassment campaign from escalating even further.“Hope Not Hate have been monitoring and reporting on the movements of Raise the Colours throughout 2025 and we are pleased to see our work pay off.”The Home Office has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumFranceThe far rightFar rightEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The UK is also withdrawing staff from the base, the Guardian understands.In the early hours of Thursday, reports emerged that Iran had closed its airspace to all flights except international flights to and from Iran that had been given permission. The flight-tracking websiteFlightradar24said the advisory was valid for a little more than two hours.Hours earlier, Lufthansa said its flights would avoid Iranian and Iraqi airspace “until further notice”. The group, which includes Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Discover Airlines, Eurowings, Swiss and ITA Airways, said in a statement that it was bypassing the airspace “due to the current situation in the Middle East” and that some flights could be cancelled.Lufthansa said it would operate its routes to Israel and Jordan as daytime flights from Thursday to Monday next week.In June,Iran struck al-Udeidafter the US hit nuclear enrichment facilities in Iran, though the strike was telegraphed and largely symbolic.In contrast to indications of an imminent US strike, however,Donald Trumpsaid he had been told “on good authority” that plans for executions in Iran had stopped, despite evidence to the contrary in Iran. “We’ve been told that the killing in Iran is stopping – it’s stopped – it’s stopping,” said Trump. “And there’s no plan for executions, or an execution, or executions – so I’ve been told that on good authority.”He said military action was still on the table and that he would wait for next steps from Iran.The Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, insisted the situation in control was “under control,” and urged the US to engage in diplomacy. “Now there’s calm. We have everything under control, and let’s hope that wisdom prevails and we don’t end up in a situation of high tension that would be catastrophic for everyone,” Araghchi told Fox News.Iranian officials previously warned the US not to intervene in nationwide protests as Trump reviews options for a strike on the country. The US president hadpromised to “rescue protesters”if Iranian authorities carried on killing them.A senior Iranian official said Iran had told regional countries that host US bases, such as Saudi Arabia and Turkey, that it would attack those bases in the event of a US strike.Israeli assessments, according to Reuters, indicate Trump has decided to intervene in Iran, but it is unclear what form or scale military action could take.Defying Trump’s threat, the Iranian government has signalled that detained protesters will face speedy trials and executions.Iran’s judicial chief, Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei, told state media: “If we want to do a job, we should do it now. If we want to do something, we have to do it quickly. If it becomes late, two months, three months later, it doesn’t have the same effect. If we want to do something, we have to do that fast.”9:37Massacres and executions: what are we hearing from inside Iran? | The LatestHuman rights groups have warned that executions of protesters could take place soon. A 26-year-old protester, Erfan Soltani, was slated to face execution on Wednesday, the first anti-government demonstrator to be given a death sentence. Soltani’s family said prison authorities had informed them thathis execution had been postponed, without giving any further details.Trump warned on Tuesday that the US would take “very strong action” if executions of protesters began. “If they do such a thing, we will take very strong action,” Trump said in an interview broadcast on Tuesday.Neighbouring countries to Iran, including Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, have reportedly discouraged the US from intervening in Iran, warning that doing so could ignite a “full-scale war”.Such a war would “certainly” have severe consequences “not only on the Middle East but on the global economy”, a Cairo-based diplomat told the Associated Press, pointing to a potential response by Iranian-backed militias across the region.A western official also told Reuters that while the unrest in Iran was happening on an unprecedented scale, the government did not seem likely to collapse and Iran’s security apparatus seemed firmly in control.The death toll in Iran has soared as authorities have carried out a brutal crackdown: 2,571 people have been killed and more than 18,100 arrested, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists news agency (HRANA). The death toll from the two-week protest movement dwarfs any other in Iran since its 1979 revolution.Protesters said there was a heavy security force on Wednesday as authorities carried out a mass funeral for 100 security forces killed in demonstrations.Tens of thousands of government supporters attended the funeral near Tehran University carrying pictures of the Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and waving the Iranian flag. A presenter chanted as mourners gathered by trucks laden with Iranian-flag draped caskets, stacked three rows high. “All of our problems are because of America, today’s economic problems are because of American sanctions. Death to America!” the presenter yelled.Hundreds of gunshot eye injuries found in one Iranian hospital amid brutal crackdown on protestsRead moreIranian state television has offered the first official acknowledgment of the deaths, quoting an official saying the country had “a lot of martyrs”.On Tuesday evening, the US state department warned American citizens to leave Iran immediately. Other western countries issued similar travel warnings.Earlier, Trump had posted amessage of support to protesterson Truth Social. “Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING - TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!!” he wrote. “Save the names of the killers and abusers. They will pay a big price. I have cancelled all meetings with Iranian Officials until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS. HELP IS ON ITS WAY.”In response, Iran’s UN mission said Washington’s “playbook” would “fail again”. The statement posted on X said: “US fantasies and policy toward Iran are rooted in regime change, with sanctions, threats, engineered unrest, and chaos serving as the modus operandi to manufacture a pretext for military intervention.”Why Trump’s options are limited when it comes to using force against IranRead moreIranian authorities claimed they had regained control of the country after successive nights of mass protests nationwide since Thursday, relaying messages to foreign counterparts that protests had been quelled.After authorities severed communications during the crackdown, Iranians were on Tuesday able to make phone calls abroad for the first time in days.Security service personnel have apparently beensearching for Starlink satellite internet terminals, as people in northern Tehran reported authorities raiding apartment buildings with satellite dishes.While satellite television dishes are illegal, many in the capital have them in homes, and officials had broadly given up on enforcing the law in recent years. Activists said on Wednesday that Starlink was offering free service in Iran.Iranian state media have aired at least 97 confessions from protesters since 28 December, according to HRANA. The group said testimony it had collected from those released showed these confessions were coerced, often after torture. The group says such coerced confessions can lead to severe consequences, including state executions.With Associated Press and ReutersExplore more on these topicsIranDonald TrumpTrump administrationMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

On Wednesday, hours after his scheduled execution, prison authorities called them and said the execution had been postponed, without offering further details.Speaking before the postponement of the execution, Somayeh, a 45-year-old close relative of Soltani’s who lives abroad, said: “I spoke to his [nuclear] family yesterday and all I know is that they were trying to visit him in prison. I haven’t slept in two days.”Somayeh and other members of the family anxiously stayed up until dawn waiting to hear news, knowing that Iranian authorities typically carry out executions around the morning call to prayers.“I can’t stop thinking about Erfan. The uncertainty is killing me,” Somayeh said through tears. “How can anyone have the heart to put a rope round the neck of such a kind child and send him to die?”9:37Massacres and executions: what are we hearing from inside Iran? | The LatestSoltani has become a symbol of defiance for Iranian activists as authorities intensify their crackdown on a nationwide protest movement.Rights groups say they fear there are many other cases like Soltani’s that are unknown due to an internet blackout in Iran, but that his case highlights the speed at which authorities are sentencing protesters.Soltani was denied access to a lawyer and legal defence, the Norway-based Hengaw Organization for Human Rights said.More than 18,000 people have been arrested and at least 2,571 killed over the last two weeks, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists news agency.Protests started on 28 December after a sudden slide in the value of the country’s currency and have since spread nationwide and expanded to demands for political reforms.Rights groups have urged Iran to halt the execution of Soltani and other protesters arrested, with Amnesty International expressing fears that Iranian authorities could “once again resort to swift trials and arbitrary executions to crush and deter dissent”.US and UK military to withdraw some personnel from Middle East amid Iranian threatsRead moreRights monitors have said Iran often sentences protesters in trials that last minutes. Soltani was given the death penalty four days after his arrest – a time period thatIranian human rights activists say deprived him of due process.Iran’s chief justice signalled on Wednesday that trials and executions would be swift, telling state media “we should do it now” to have an effect on protesters. Other judicial officials said protesters would be charged as “enemies of God”, a crime that can be met with the death penalty.Last year, Iran hanged at least 1,500 people, according to the Norway-based group Iran Human Rights.Soltani told his family that he had received a call from Iranian intelligence a few hours before his arrest, which he ignored. Despite threats from security services, he continued to join protests.Somayeh said: “Our Erfan is a kid who is innocent and peacefully wants to exercise his rights. That’s all he did. Joined his compatriots to peacefully protest.”Soltani works in a clothing shop and is passionate about fashion, fitness and Persepolis FC, a Tehran football club. His family described him as “the most loving brother” and his “mother’s best friend”.Somayeh said: “He is someone so dear to my heart, a brave child, a child who would never resort to violence, an incredibly calm and wonderful soul who means more to me than I can put into words.

The committee is not expected to begin work until mandated by a “peace board” chaired by Trump, which has yet to be created.Witkoff said the second phase would begin the “full demilitarisation and reconstruction of Gaza, primarily the disarmament of all unauthorised personnel”.The first phase of the ceasefire plan began on 10 October, with the exchange of Israeli hostages held by Hamas and its allies for Palestinian detainees held by Israel. Israeli forces withdrew to ayellow truce linethat left them in control of most of the territory.The Israeli bombardment of Gaza diminished buthas not ceased. About 450 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire began. No agreement has been reached on disarming Hamas.Two groups representing Israeli former hostages and their families had urged the US not to declare the start of the second phase of the ceasefire until the remains of the last hostage yet to be accounted for, Ran Gvili, had been returned by Hamas. Hamas has said it has so far been unable to find Gvili’s body.“The US expects Hamas to comply fully with its obligations, including the immediate return of the final deceased hostage,” Witkoff said. “Failure to do so will bring serious consequences.”Though Witkoff did not provide any details of the proposed Palestinian interim committee, the Egyptian foreign minister, Badr Abdelatty, announced a few hours earlier that an agreement had been reached on all of its 15 members.Abdelatty said the committee would be “deployed to the Gaza Strip to manage daily life and essential services”.The members are expected to be technocrats rather than politicians, but some are believed to have affiliation with the Fatah party, which is dominant in the Palestinian Authority. Two candidates touted as potential heads are Ali Shaath, a former deputy minister of planning in the Palestinian Authority, and Majed Abu Ramadan, the PA health minister.According to diplomats in the region, the work of the Palestinian transitional committee will be overseen by Nickolay Mladenov, a veteran Bulgarian and UN diplomat who has been touring the region holding talks with Israeli and Palestinian officials. Mladenov served as the UN envoy for the Middle East peace process from early 2015 until the end of 2020 and is widely respected across the region.Mladenov in turn would report to Trump’s peace board, which is expected to comprise a group of world leaders. US officials said its membership would be announced in the next few days.Discussions in Cairo on the second phase are said to have also focused on the further withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, the reopening of the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza and the entry of aid stockpiled on the Egyptian side of the border – as well as a general increase in the flow of goods and aid entering Gaza.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineUS foreign policyIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

In September 1978, the US Defence Intelligence Agency, for instance, reported that “the shah is expected to remain actively in power over the next 10 years”. A state department report suggested “the shah would not have to stand down until 1985 at the earliest”.Sir Anthony Parsons, then the UK ambassador in Tehran, sent a message to the Foreign Office dated May 1978 saying: “I do not believe there is a serious risk of an overthrow of the regime while the shah is at the helm.”Parsons later wrote an anguished book asking whether as British ambassador he could “have anticipated that the forces of opposition to the shah – the religious class, the bazaar, the students – would combine to destroy him”. He concluded that his inability to predict an event that he compared in import to the French Revolution was not due to a lack of information, but from a failure to interpret the information correctly.The experience of 1979 means the intelligence assessments now coming out of western embassies will be starting with a caveat and probably ending with a question mark.In contrast, academic experts on Iran do not see much indication today of the kind of mass defections from the regime thatReza Pahlavi, the former shah’s son, has been predicting. He recently claimed that 50,000 officers in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) were preparing to desert, a claim he has since had to revise.Vali Nasr, author of the book Iran’s Grand Strategy, told the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), a US thinktank: “There is no sign of any defections from within the regime or that it has in any way fractured. I am not certain the balance of forces necessarily lies with the protesters. Crowds win when the other side falls.”Ray Takeyh, senior fellow of Middle East studies at the CFR, agreed, saying: “This is not yet a national movement. There are a lot fence-sitters trying to figure which way they want to go. They will have to feel some degree of immunity to do as they did in 1978.”It is true that before the repression, and before thethreats from Donald Trumpstarted, evidence had emerged of differences in approach to handling the crisis, for instance, between the reformist president, Masoud Pezeshkian, and the head of the judiciary, Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje’i. On the third day of the protests, for example, Pezeshkian said: “Don’t go after America or blame anyone … It is we who must properly manage our problems;it is we who must find a way to solve the problems.” Even on Sunday, after the crackdown had started, he told state TV: “We hear the protesters and have made every effort to solve their problems.”As the protests spread, and became more radicalised, Pezeshkian’s strategy of self-criticism and legitimising the protests lost out to those saying this was a national security crisis. The opaque true power centres inside Iran – the 86-year-old supreme leader, the IRGC and the Supreme National Security Council – clearly decided the contrition needed to end. No one at the top of government dissented, as far as it is known.It was notable that the main person addressing the crowds in Revolution Square in Tehran on Monday was not Pezeshkian, but Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the speaker of the parliament and a former IRGC commander. Ghalibaf threatened to set the region on fire – a clear warning that if Iran was attacked, the regime regarded US bases in countries such as Qatar as legitimate targets. The foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, by contrast has spent 18 months trying to strengthen relations with Doha, Cairo and Riyadh.Mohammad Ali Shabani, the respected editor of the Amwaj website, said that historically in Iran protests had led to a regime rebalancing in favour of repression. The judiciary chief, for instance, is now calling for swift punishment of the rioters.Some of Iran’s most experienced IRGC figures, including its chief, Hossein Salami, were killed inIsrael’s attacks in June, but their ethos remains. It is true that the ease of the Israeli decapitation in June meant the IRGC lost some of its prestige in society, but the new generation of leaders swiftly appointed by the supreme leader are cut from the same ideological cloth.Moreover senior figures in the government have so far cohered around the message that the security forces had no choice but to confront an Israeli-inspired insurrection.The violence that descended on Iran on Thursday and Friday is being portrayed as the 11th and 12th days of the US-Israeli attack in June. With newspapers heavily censored or unavailable, stories that challenge this narrative are not easily available to many Iranians, save through word of mouth.But if it is confirmed that about 2,000 people have been killed, this represents a qualitatively different scale of repression to previous convulsions.There is a palpable sense of shock from officials. There are also private admissions that this is an unsustainable way of governing, and the underlying issues have to be grasped even if reforms involve taking on the banks and IRGC’s dominance of the economy. It is these economic reforms that challenge Iran’s elite that may create a true split at the top of the government – which is why they have always been postponed.Takeyh warned that the status quo was no longer sustainable: “The regime has created a cycle, because the underlying causes of dissent – economic mismanagement, corruption, foreign policy disasters that have cost billions, and the lack of opportunity – cannot be addressed by the regime.”One way or another, it is this impasse, once the mourning is over, that will have to be addressed.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaAyatollah Ali KhameneiUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Such a move would be controversial, with Reform leading in the polls and vowing to curtail the operational independence of police.The report by Sir Andy Cooke, the chief inspector of constabulary, found several errors in how the West Midlands force gathered intelligence on the risks of Maccabi fans coming toBirmingham.The threat was “greatly exaggerated”, leaving a safety committee that relied on the police intelligence “with little or no option” but to ban them, the report said.It said the force made misleading statements through “confirmation bias” and “carelessness rather than any deliberate distortion”, and not through antisemitism. Nor was it due to bowing to political pressure from those in Birmingham angered by Israel’s alleged genocide in Gaza.The report blamed the force’s leadership and Mahmood was even more damning, saying: “Faced by a game of such importance, the chief constable of the force, Craig Guildford, should have ensured more professional and thorough work was done.“As Sir Andy himself says, the ‘shortcomings’ detailed in his report are, and I quote, ‘symptomatic of a force not applying the necessary strategic oversight and not paying enough attention to important matters of detail, including at the most senior levels’.“The ultimate responsibility for the force’s failure to discharge its duties on a matter of such national importance rests with the chief constable, and it is for that reason that I must declare today that the chief constable of West Midlands police no longer has my confidence.”One senior policing source said Guildford was a “dead man walking”, with the errors “dumbfounding” investigators, the home secretary and her officials.The only person who can oust Guildford is Simon Foster, the police and crime commissioner for the West Midlands.He has praised Guildford for improving the force’s performance and service to the public. He said he would consider Cooke’s report, a second one which is expected from the policing inspectorate and one from MPs on the home affairs committee, as well as subjecting Guildford to a public inquisition on 27 January.The Guardian understands Guildford does not believe that demands from the home secretary necessitate his immediate resignation. He will wait to see whether Foster decides to trigger the process for dismissal. The force leadership believes its decisions kept the public safe but accepts there are clear lessons to be learned.Central to the police case for a ban was what officers claimed Dutch police told them about a Maccabi game in Amsterdam in 2024. Guildford and his force believed Maccabi fans were perpetrators of violence, with the report saying it wrongly blamed them, when it knew of information to the contrary.Testimony from Dutch police to the inquiry,revealed on Monday by the Guardian, crucially undermined the force’s credibility with Cooke – they disputed several claims alleged to have come from them and on which UK police relied.Mahmood said: “The West Midlands police engagement with the Dutch police is one of the most disquieting elements of Sir Andy’s report. The summary, provided as evidence to the safety advisory group … was inaccurate.“Claims, including the number of police officers deployed, links between fans and the Israel Defence Forces, the targeting of Muslim communities, the mass tearing down of Palestinian flags [in Amsterdam], attacks on police officers, and on taxi drivers were all either exaggerated or simply untrue.”The safety group was told Maccabi fans threw Muslims into a river. In fact an Israeli fan was thrown in the water, and Cooke said British police knew that having read official Dutch reports.Mahmood said Cooke’s findings showed that “the police overstated the threat posed by theMaccabi Tel Avivfans, while understating the risk that was posed to the Israeli fans if they travelled to the area” amid intelligence that some people in Birmingham were preparing to arm themselves.Guildford has apologised for the inclusion in his force’s intelligence reports of a Maccabi match against West Ham, which never took place. Cooke said one officer described the error as “an AI hallucination”.West Midlands police said: “We know that mistakes were made but reiterate the findings that none of this was done with an intent of deliberate distortion or discrimination.“West Midlands police is an anti-discriminatory organisation and our planning for this football match was always about public safety of all communities.”Ruth Jacobs, chair of the Birmingham and West Midlands Jewish Community, said of Guildford: “I think the majority of the community would feel that this is the right time to go in view of all the dreadful things that have been revealed.”While Foster said he would wait, Birmingham council’s leader and the West Midlands mayor, both Labour, said Guildford must go.TheWest Midlands mayor, Richard Parker, said: “Significant questions remain unanswered about the timing, rationale and evidence underpinning decisions taken by the police and the Birmingham safety advisory group.“Since the decision to ban away fans, explanations have shifted, evidence has been withdrawn and the HMIC [His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary] report highlights further failures and inconsistencies.“Public trust in policing depends on clarity, transparency and accountability. Recent events have seriously undermined that trust.“I do not believe the chief constable’s position is tenable.”The government’s independent adviser on antisemitism, Lord Mann, also said the chief constable should go: “You can’t be seen to be misleading a committee and that’s not tenable in high public office. If I can find out the straightforward facts, why can’t the West Midlands police?”The independent MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, Ayoub Khan, said Guildford was the victim of a “witch hunt” and “being thrown under the bus”. He insisted West Midlands police “have a reputation for working with all communities” and have “never caved into community pressure”.The Israeli embassy said Maccabi Tel Aviv fans should receive an “appropriate apology” and “concrete” steps must be taken to prevent a similar situation from occurring in future. It added: “We are encouraged that the truth is now coming to light, and we welcome the commitment shown to transparency, accountability and the restoration of public trust.”Explore more on these topicsPoliceMaccabi Tel AvivAston VillaPolice and crime commissionersBirminghamAntisemitismIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

It received another in 2022, making it the first site inWalesto win two stars. Prices start at £468 per person.The restaurant scored one out of five from a visit byFoodStandards Agency officers on 5 November, meaning “major improvement” is necessary.Chef patron Gareth Ward told the BBC on Wednesday he was “not embarrassed” by the rating, which he said was due to inspectors’ concerns about the use of raw and aged ingredients.“I’m buying sashimi-grade fish from Japan and they’re questioning, ‘Well, we don’t know the water, so how do we know it’s sashimi grade?’“Well, it is sashimi grade, this stuff’s eaten raw all over the world and just because our rules don’t fit their rules, they’re questioning it … I’ve got a salt chamber for ageing fish but they obviously don’t like the idea of ageing stuff.“I’m not at all ashamed but I am disappointed. I’m not sat here thinking, ‘Oh my God, I’m embarrassed, I’ve done something wrong’, because we haven’t. What we have done is something different.”Ward, a former contestant on MasterChef: The Professionals, said Ynyshir employs a specialist compliance company to address food safety and has a £50,000 freezer capable of reaching temperatures of -80C (-112F).After the inspection, the restaurant’s fish was sent away for independent laboratory testing, which found no concerns.Ward acknowledged that the food safety officers were “not 100% wrong”, and has since installed an additional hand-washing station in the fish preparation area. He also said paperwork problems contributed to the poor score.“Some of our paperwork wasn’t right, and that’s our fault,” he said. “Sometimes you miss stuff or sometimes you write stuff down wrong or forget … I’d need a full-time office worker doing the paperwork to get it perfect every time.”In Wales and Northern Ireland, all food establishments are legally required to display their hygiene rating in a prominent place.In a statement, a spokesperson for Ynyshir said the business had requested a reinspection but no date had been set.Explore more on these topicsWalesFoodMichelin GuidenewsShareReuse this content"

One People. One Heritage’, prompt comparisons to Nazi sloganMichael SainatoWed 14 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Jan 2026 12.06 ESTShareUnion leaders have accused theTrump administrationof a “rhetorical shift towards white supremacy” after social media posts by the US Department of Labor drew comparison with a Nazi slogan.Recent posts from the agency include a video captioned “remember who you are, American”, with the phrase: “One Homeland. One People. One Heritage.”Users of X, formerly Twitter, and Grok, the platform’s AI tool, highlighted a similarity with the Nazi slogan: “Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer” (“one people, one realm, one leader”).“The similarity to that Nazi slogan is bad,” Christopher Hayes, a labor historian and professor at Rutgers University, told the Guardian, expressing alarm over “the motivation behind it, the message, the sentiment and desired outcome”.Jimmy Williams Jr, general president of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, said the labor department had repeatedly imitated “far-right and fascist imagery” online: “When people tell you who they are, believe them.”Puneet Maharaj, executive director of National Nurses United, the largest nurses’ union in the US, added: “It is no surprise that a fascist regime would post fascist propaganda on a fascist social media network like X, but it remains concerning to see the DOL making posts that serve a fascist, white supremacist agenda.”The Department of Labor did not comment on the agency’s specific rhetoric on social media. “The social media campaign was created to celebrate American workers and the American Dream,” a spokesperson said.The campaign has triggered a chorus of criticism, alarmed historians and senior figures in the labor movement, and concerned workers inside the agency.“The whole point is to demonize the foreign worker, to convince the white working-class vision of the guy who loves Trump,” said Hayes. “The point is to convince that guy [that] he is the real American, he has been all along,and people like him made this country, and only people like him, so only people like him belong. It’s the same thing the Nazis did.”Nazi propaganda featured “idealized smiling Germans with these grandiose slogans…about what your country is doing, how great your country is, what you can do for it, and it erases the other,” said Hayes.“The other, in the case of Germany, was the Jew.”Under Trump, the labor department has published artwork,apparently generated by artificial intelligence(AI), depicting only white male workers. “Primarily here we have a lot of others, and they’re all erased in those montages,” added Hayes.Other posts by the labor department frequentlycite“Americanism”, decry “globalism” and toutmisleading claimsthat all US job gains under Trump have gone to “native born” Americans.Maharaj, of National Nurses United, said the agency’s posts formed “part of a broader rhetorical shift towards white supremacy that many federal departments and agencies are undergoing under the Trump administration”.“There are no words strong enough to condemn the propagandistic use of federal departments and their social media channels towards the administration’s ends, which are clearly to harm working people and to benefit billionaires, regardless of immigration status for either,” she added.Williams Jr, of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, said: “There is a very clear through-line between the administration’s fascist imagery and their violent behavior, likewhat we all just saw in Minneapoliswhen Renee Good was killed by anICE[Immigration and Customs Enforcement] agent.”Inside the labor department, the agency’s rhetoric has also caused consternation.A labor department employee, not authorized to speak publicly, described the recent social media activity as “radical and ideological”, and said they feared such posts undermine trust in the agency.“Fear reduces reporting, cooperation and early resolution. Those outcomes harm workers first and weaken the agency’s mission,” they said. “Political tone on official channels creates discomfort for career staff and weakens credibility with workers and employers. I wish the Department of Labor would remember who they are and what they do.”A former labor department staffer, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, said the rhetoric was “disturbing and harkens back to a whites-only era”, adding: “When they publish posts that decry ‘globalism’, as a Jew, I recognize that as anantisemitic dog whistle.”Another former official at the agency, who also requested anonymity, citing fears of harassment, said the department’s social media profiles were previously a place where workers and employers could find important information, developed by policy experts.“Now it’s a place where they can find AI slop developed by a 23-year-old,with no discernible insights on work or workers,” they said. “What a difference a year makes.”Explore more on these topicsUS unionsTrump administrationSocial mediaThe far rightUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Saks Global said early on Wednesday its stores would remain open for now after it finalised a $1.75bn financing package and appointed a new CEO.Geoffroy van Raemdonck, the former Neiman Marcus CEO, willreplace Richard Baker, who was the architect of the acquisition strategy that left Saks Global saddled with debt.Saks Global CEO steps down as luxury retailer reportedly preparing for bankruptcyRead moreSaks Fifth Avenue, the retail arm of Saks Global, listed $1bn to $10bn in assets and liabilities, according to documents filed in US bankruptcy court in Houston, Texas.In the year after Saks and Neiman Marcus combined to form Saks Global, the company became addled with issues, including overdue payments to vendors, who started to withhold inventory. The company’s revenue fell 13% in the second quarter of last year.The company has been showing signs of struggle over the last few weeks. In late December, the company sold its Neiman Marcus Beverly Hills flagship property. Less than two weeks later, longtime Saks executive and CEO Marc Metrick abruptly announced hisresignation.A retailer long loved by the rich and famous, from Gary Cooper to Grace Kelly, Saks fell on hard times after the Covid pandemic, as competition from online outlets rose, and brands started more frequently selling items through their own stores.“This is a defining moment for Saks Global, and the path ahead presents a meaningful opportunity to strengthen the foundation of our business and position it for the future,” said van Raemdonck. “In close partnership with these newly appointed leaders and our colleagues across the organization, we will navigate this process together with a continued focus on serving our customers and luxury brands.”The new financing deal would provide an immediate cash infusion of $1bn through a debtor-in-possession loan from an investor group, Saks Global said.Financing worth $240m would be available through an asset-backed loan provided by the company’s asset-based lenders, according to the company. The luxury retailer will have access to $500m of financing from the investor group once it successfully exits bankruptcy protection, expected later this year, it added.A host of luxury brands were among the unsecured creditors, led by Chanel and Gucci owner Kering at about $136m and $60m respectively, the court filing said.The world’s biggest luxury conglomerate, LVMH, was listed as an unsecured creditor at $26m. In total, Saks Global estimated there were between 10,001 and 25,000 creditors.In 2024, Baker had masterminded the takeover of Neiman Marcus by Canada’s Hudson’s Bay Co, which had owned Saks since 2013, and later spun off the US luxury assets to create Saks Global, bringing three names that have defined American high fashion for over a century under one roof.The $2.7bn deal was built on about $2bn in debt financing and equity contributions from investors including Amazon, Salesforce and Authentic Brands. Amazon and Authentic Brands were listed in the court filing as equity investors.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsRetail industryConsumer spendingEconomicsLuxury goods sectornewsShareReuse this content"

But he said he was concerned about his job security after the incident, claiming he had been “targeted for political retribution” and for “embarrassing Trump in front of his friends”.“I don’t feel as though fate looks upon you often, and when it does, you better be ready to seize the opportunity,” Sabula added in the interview. “And today I think I did that.”A GoFundMe wascreated on his behalfto help cover lost income from the suspension. As of Wednesday lunchtime, it had raised more than $150,000, with purported donors including the band the Dropkick Murphys.“TJ is a father of two young children, husband, and is a proud United Auto Workers (UAW) Local 600 line worker. Funds donated will support TJ and his family to cover expenses during this time of uncertainty,” the GoFundMe campaign states.Ford did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The White House communications director, Steven Cheung, didn’t confirm whether Trump flashed his middle finger, but argued in astatementto the Guardian that the president had given an “appropriate and unambiguous response” when “a lunatic was wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage”.Trump had been touring the Ford complex beforedelivering a speech at the Detroit Economic Club.The United Auto Workers criticized Sabula’s suspension, and vowed to fight it.“The autoworker at the Dearborn Truck Plant is a proud member of a strong and fighting union – the UAW,” said Laura Dickerson, vice-president and director of the Ford department at the UAW. “He believes in freedom of speech, a principle we wholeheartedly embrace, and we stand with our membership in protecting their voice on the job.”“The UAW will ensure that our member receives the full protection of all negotiated contract language safeguarding his job and his rights as a union member,” she added. “Workers should never be subjected to vulgar language or behavior by anyone – including the President of the United States.”Explore more on these topicsMichiganDonald TrumpUS economyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Its bid has beenbackstopped by a personal $40bn guaranteeby Larry Ellison, a co-founder of Oracle.WBD has previously told its shareholders to reject the“inadequate” hostile takeover bidby Paramount and has argued that its offer relies on a significant amount of debt financing.Amid an extraordinary corporate battle, Paramount is planning tonominate directors to WBD’s boardto vote against the Netflix deal.Under the terms of Netflix’s original deal, WBD shareholders were due $23.25 a share in cash as well as stock in the streaming company and equity in WBD’s global networks operation – which Netflix is not buying – that includes CNN, the Cartoon Network and the Discovery Channel.Warner Bros formallyput itself up for sale in Octoberafter receiving interest from several parties. It agreed the deal with Netflixin early Decemberafter rival takeover bids from Paramount and Comcast, which owns assets including Universal Studios, the US news network NBC and Sky.Since making the agreement with Netflix, WBD has faced repeated attempts by Paramount to overturn the deal and accept its offer.WBD shares closed 1.6% higher on Tuesday after reports of Netflix’s plans, while shares in Netflix rose 1%.Explore more on these topicsWarner BrosNetflixMergers and acquisitionsParamount PicturesTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

With war still raging in Ukraine, “state-based armed conflict” was the second most-common risk identified at 14%. Extreme weather events was third, chosen by 8% of respondents.The warning came after a year marked byDonald Trump’s aggressive tariff policy, and follows US military action in Venezuela, which the president acknowledged was aimed atsecuring the country’s oil resources.Economic sanctions have become an increasingly common tool in recent years – including thefreezing of billions of dollars of Russian assetsafter the country’s invasion of Ukraine.There are also growing concerns about clashes over access to important economic resources. Finance ministers from the G7 met in Washington on Monday to discuss how to diversify the supply of the rare earth metals crucial to tech products, many of which China has control over.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent, who convened the meeting, warned that supply chains for these critical minerals had become“highly concentrated and vulnerable to disruption and manipulation”.Over a longer horizon – 10 years – the most severe risks identified in the WEF survey all relate to the climate emergency. “Extreme weather events” topped the list, followed by “biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse” and “critical change to Earth systems”.“Unlike in the two-year outlook, where these have declined in rankings, the existential nature of environmental risks means they remain as the top priorities over the next decade,” the report says.Next week’s annual Davos meeting will see thousands of senior figures from politics, business and civil society, including more than 60 heads of state or government, gather to discuss the state of the global economy at the event in the Swiss Alps.This year’s theme is “a spirit of dialogue” – but its star guest will be US presidentDonald Trump, who has spent the first year of his second term waging a trade war and ripping up the country’s global obligations, including the Paris climate agreement.Other senior politicians in attendance will include German chancellor Friedrich Merz, Chinese vice-premier He Lifeng, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and Argentine president Javier Milei.In its annual global risks report, published on Wednesday, the WEF warned that “rules and institutions that have long underpinned stability are under siege in a new era in which trade, finance and technology are wielded as weapons of influence”.Most recently, the world’s central bankersissued a statement expressing solidaritywith Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, whose independence has come under attack from Trump, who has repeatedly called for faster interest rate cuts.UK chancellor Rachel Reeves and business secretary Peter Kyle will also attend.Explore more on these topicsDavos 2026DavosEconomic policyTariffsDonald TrumpInternational tradeGlobal economynewsShareReuse this content"

And when it was over, thisCarabao Cupsemi-final felt firmly within their grip. But for a late goal from the Chelsea substitute Alejandro Garnacho, his second of an eventful cameo, it would surely have been over.Even so, it was difficult on this evidence to predict anything other thanArsenalprogressing into the final; moving closer to a rare piece of silverware under Mikel Arteta – one to pave the way for others this season?‘I’m accountable’: Rosenior deflects blame from Sánchez after Chelsea’s lossRead moreArsenal brought the physical fight. There were times when they seemed to bullyChelsea, when they made Liam Rosenior fret on his first home game as the Chelsea manager. They scored the opener from a reassuringly familiar source, Ben White converting from a Declan Rice corner – Arsenal’s 24th goal from a set piece this season.Robert Sánchez offered minimal resistance in the Chelsea goal; he was all at sea under the delivery and he would be at fault for Arsenal’s second, which was turned in by Viktor Gyökeres early in the second half. Sánchez’s handling error on a low cross from White was grotesque, of a piece with an erratic individual performance.Chelsea battled, especially Garnacho, even if his first goal was the prompt for Arsenal to score again. It was Martín Zubimendi who provided the moment of the night, a flash of silk amid the steel, his ice-cold finish after Gyökeres’s layoff leading Arteta to rub his eyes in astonishment.At that point, it felt as though Arsenal would score again to turn the second leg in early February into nothing more than a contractual obligation. Credit to Chelsea for staying alive, to Garnacho for another confident conversion. Rosenior could praise the spirit of his players. Was it real hope? The smart money said it was simply an illusion.View image in fullscreenAlejandro Garnacho scores Chelsea’s second goal to give them hope.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersIt was comfortably the biggest game of Rosenior’s managerial career, albeit this is a line that will be repeated quite a bit in the coming weeks and the first thing to say is he could have been luckier with his player availability. The headline absentees were the injured Reece James and Cole Palmer and the suspended Moisés Caicedo. Liam Delap was a late cry-off because of illness.Arteta’s idea was to leave nothing to chance. He has been stung bytoo many semi-final defeats. He has managed to get through only one of five so far during his time in charge at Arsenal – against Manchester City on the victorious FA Cup run in 2019-20, his only trophy to date. He went as strong as possible with his XI, apart from giving Kepa Arrizabalaga a runout in goal.If it was the dream start for Arsenal, it was a nightmare for Rosenior. He had been introduced to the Stamford Bridge crowd before kick-off, striding on to the pitch to applaud the fans but there was only hesitation from his defenders after Jurriën Timber won an early corner off Trevoh Chalobah. “Set piece again,” chorused the Arsenal fans before Rice dropped the kick into the area of maximum discomfort. They have seen this movie before.View image in fullscreenBen White celebrates after opening the scoring from a corner.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesIt was a horrible moment for Sánchez. He was boxed in and ran only into his teammate Marc Cucurella, before stretching up an arm in a vain waft at the ball. White headed down and in from point-blank range.Arsenal brought the intensity. They pressed high. Rosenior roamed his technical area, clapping in quickfire bursts in an attempt to gee up his players but it was tough going before the interval. Chelsea diced with disaster as they tried to play out from the back, Arsenal players hounding them every step of the way. Sánchez looked particularly shaky.Estêvão Willian was a bright spot for the home team. There was a jet-heeled burst from him in the 37th minute, taking him away from a posse of red but then no help from his teammates towards the corner flag. Inevitably, he was crowded out. Moments earlier, he had cut inside to unload a vicious shot with minimal backlift that Arrizabalaga repelled.The Stamford Bridge natives were restless and there were boos from them at half-time. Arsenal had toyed with a second goal, Zubimendi swiping one shot high, William Saliba going close with another and the goal did come after the restart.Arsenal played quickly from a throw-in on the right, Bukayo Saka releasing White on the overlap but the full-back’s low cross looked straightforward for Sánchez. Yet his first move was almost to jump; it was certainly a weird way to set himself and the fumble was a consequence. Gyökeres needed a goal. He will not score an easier one.Sánchez nightmare suggests Rosenior will soon have to show his ruthless sideRead moreGarnacho’s response was well timed because the mood among the home fans was turning. The dissatisfaction at the hierarchy is palpable; many supporters have lost faith in Behdad Eghbali, the co-controlling owner, and the youth-first project that he is overseeing; the trading model. They told him in no uncertain terms that he was “not wanted here”. There were also chants in support of the former owner, Roman Abramovich.Rosenior had introduced Garnacho for the ineffective Marc Guiu and the goal followed a Pedro Neto cross. Garnacho lurked unmarked beyond the back post; a rare Arsenal defensive lapse. He lashed past Arrizabalaga.Back came Arsenal. Zubimendi’s composure was astonishing, his fake-to-shoot move sending Wesley Fofana off towards Fulham Broadway station, the time bought for the shot past Sánchez. The Chelsea goalkeeper would save brilliantly to keep out a volley from the substitute Mikel Merino, while Gabriel Magalhães might have scored from a corner.Arsenal were rampant, although Garnacho took a little wind out of their sails when he rammed a shot down and in after Gabriel could only half-clear following a corner. It was only a little.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupChelseaArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Steve Kerr and Doc Rivers, the head coaches of the Golden State Warriors and Milwaukee Bucks respectively,described Good’s death as “murder”. Kerr also attacked the Trump administration’s attempts to portray Good as a terrorist.Etan Thomas“It’s shameful that the government can come out and lie about what happened when there’s video and witnesses who have all come out and disputed what the government is saying,” Kerr said.Meanwhile, a fan at the Minnesota Timberwolves home game on Thursday yelled “Go Home ICE” duringa moment of silencefor Good. Many in the crowdresponded with cheers.Most rational thinking people, then, seem to be in agreement on the subject. And then there’s Stephen A Smith. The ESPN hot-take machine seemed to align himself with the Trump regime’s assessment of Good’s death. Here arehis exact words.“I saw the video on numerous occasions and seeing what transpired from a lawful perspective as it pertains to a law enforcement official, don’t expect him to be prosecuted. He was completely justified,” Smith said.“From a humanitarian perspective, however, why did you have to do that? If you could move out the way, that means you could have shot the tires. That means you could have got a few feet away after you shot the tires. And if you were unsuccessful in doing that, you could have got her down the road.“You didn’t have to do that. She wasn’t driving down the road coming at you 90 miles an hour. She was parked in the middle of the street, and rather than get out the car, she wrongfully tried to drive off and wrongfully disregarded a law enforcement official, which is exactly what ICE is, and, as a result, lost her life because of it.”Warriors’ Steve Kerr rips US government’s response to ICE ‘murder’ in MinneapolisRead moreMaking the argument that a woman who posed absolutely no immediate threat at the same time deserved to be shot in the face is as disheartening as it is illogical. Like so many of the Maga crowd, who don’t seem to take as harsh a line on the January 6 rioters who definitely didn’t comply with law enforcement when they stormed the Capitol, Smith’s rhetoric appears to be blaming Good for her own death when he emphasizes she “wrongfully disregarded an order”.Understandably, this brought on swift condemnation of Smith. Don Lemon described him as a “disappointment”, while former ESPN personality Keith Olbermann called for his firing.Veteran broadcaster Soledad O’Brien said thatSmith simply does not understand many of the topics he speaks about once he strays from sports. “Stephen A Smith consistently jumps into issues, whether it’s politics or social issues, or in this case a legal issue that looks at how law enforcement is supposed to react, with zero knowledge or expertise and happily weighs in,” she told me.In response,Smith saidhis words had been twisted and reported out of context. “I’m talking about legality when I’m talking about justification, nothing else,” Smith said. “Everything else about it is wrong. Morally and ethically wrong.” But he still maintained much of his original position. “In the moment when you are dealing with law enforcement officials, you obey their orders so you can get home safely,” he said one day later in a lengthy segment designed to clean up his original remarks. “Renee Good did not do that.”The problem is that just because something is a law does not mean that it is just. Yes, law enforcement officials often escape punishment because of qualified immunity. But as Chuck Modi, my co-host on The Collision: Where Sports And Politics Collide,points out: “If you’re going to make that point, the next thing out of your mouth should be that that is a terrible law. And he didn’t say that.”If Smith doesn’t condemn the law, the message he is sending is that, in his not so humble opinion, the law is OK. It’s important to remember that every law is not a good law. The Jim Crow laws were legal. Slavery was legal for much of America’s history. Stating that something is legal, without any further exploration, isn’t enough.Smith is beginning to sound like another media figurehe has long attacked: Jason Whitlock. Both haveechoed Maga talking points, positioning themselves as the Black faces figures on the right can point to and say,“See, he agrees with us, so we can’t be racist.”It’s why Maga platforms welcome them so readily – they are seen as allies, on their side, the “good ones”.Smith and Whitlock are not unaware of any of this. “Stephen A Smith has done the math,” O’Brien told me. “This is what you have to say if you want to have the audience that he is trying to build. A rabid audience that will stand by you. And that audience has a financial value. I’m past being disappointed.”My hope is that one day Smith and Whitlock experience the kind of personal and racial reckoning depicted at the end of Spike Lee’s Bamboozled, when Manray, played by Savion Glover, looks in the mirror and realizes he can no longer wear blackface and tap dance for a white audience that has rewarded him with fame and fortune. That Smith and Whitlock come to see that the gold coins and head pats from Maga hands are no longer worth the cost, and finally hang up their tap shoes for good. But I won’t hold my breath.Explore more on these topicsUS sportsMinnesota ICE shootingESPNNBAICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)commentShareReuse this content"

If free agent Trinity Rodman signs abroad, too, that’ll leave only four players from that lineup on NWSL rosters to start the domestic season.The distribution of where USWNT players compete has dramatically shiftedunder Emma Hayes. So many star players have headed to European Goliaths, including Hayes’s former club Chelsea, that last year she had to assure the NWSL board of governors she isn’t pushing her athletes to leave the league, per areportfrom ESPN. Hayes insists she simply supports her players’ aspirations, whatever they may be. Today, out of the seven players with the most USWNT minutes in 2025, only two of them – Emily Sonnett and Claire Hutton – are playing stateside.Rodman’s future and Liverpool in need to buy – welcome to the women’s transfer windowRead moreCoffey’s departure is the cherry on top; the 27-year-old deep-lying midfielder and Portland captain earned more USWNT minutes than any other player in 2025. And the price tag for her transfer – reported to bearound $800,000 (£600,000) – shows that European teams are willing and able to shell out for talent in their prime up and down the American roster, not just uberfamous goalscorers. (Defender Naomi Girma’s$1.1m transferto Chelsea from San Diego Wave beats Coffey’s, but her reputation was bigger than Coffey’s is now.)As the US has gained strength under Hayes, observers of theNWSLhave been ringing alarm bells about the state of the league. If top American players can now play wherever they want, why do so many of them want to play far from home?That the NWSL is drifting from the center of the USWNT ecosystem is notable considering the league’s origins. The US Soccer Federation (USSF) was the engine behind its creation; when the league launched the federation had a managing role and paid the full salaries of 24 national team players. Those players soon had little choice but to play in the NWSL; Christen Press, for example, hasdiscussedbeing forced by US Soccer to leave her Swedish club, Tyresö FF, to join the Chicago Red Stars, a team she did not wish to play for.The federation’s efforts to make the USWNT stay stateside were successful for the better part of a decade. Every player on the US World Cup rosters in 2015 and 2019 played in the NWSL, save Abby Wambach, who was unattached. National team players had stints in European leagues, but they were always just that – stints – rather than multiyear moves.View image in fullscreenUS midfielder Catarina Macario moved to Europe in 2021, first signing with Lyon and later joining Chelsea.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/The FA/Getty ImagesThat lasted until Jill Ellis left her role as USWNT head coach in 2019. From there, US Soccer changed tune, and star players, such as Lindsey Heaps and Catarina Macario, began to trickle to Europe. In 2021 – the same year US Soccerstepped awayfrom its managerial role over the league – the shift in philosophy was made firm with the federationendingits paying of USWNT players’ NWSL salaries.In 2023, US Soccer reaffirmed its changed course byhiring Hayesto take over for Vlatko Andonovski. In Hayes, the federation picked a head coach from England’s Women’s Super League who was known for scouting players from all over the world. Her selection for the top job proved the federation was looking to embrace the global game, no longer committed to prizing NWSL play over all else.Since then, a more mature NWSL has been left to stand on its own, and European clubs have a few things that NWSL clubs don’t. Legacy, for one – most aspiring pros who watched club soccer growing up would probably have watched the flashiest men’s leagues, which are in Europe. Being able to wear the storied Arsenal or Manchester City badge is no doubt alluring. “For as long as I’ve kicked a ball, I’ve always dreamed of playing professional soccer in Europe, and it’s something I simply have to pursue,” Coffeysaidin a farewell video released by the Thorns.With that legacy comes money. In Europe, clubs earn most of their profits from their men’s teams, and are able to spend more money on women’s salaries than NWSL clubs can, considering American teams are hamstrung by the league’s paltry salary cap. That’s not to say they always do – the seismic transfers have been mostly limited to a few top clubs. But that the most successful European clubs have started paying huge transfer fees to acquire whomever they set their sights on has been more than enough to shake the NWSL. For the Chelseas and Lyons of the world, their ambitions have caught up totheir freedom, and even the most ambitious NWSL clubs can’t compete with them in the global market.Once the NWSL flew the nest of US Soccer, the league had an opportunity to embrace some of the freedom the rest of the world enjoys. But recent events have highlighted just how much the NWSL appears unable to catch up to the reality that it is in charge of its own destiny. In December, Commissioner Jessica Bermanthwarted a contractbetween Rodman and the Washington Spirit, which had anticipated future growth for the league’s income and back-filled a large salary. Soon after, the league announced the perplexing “High Impact Player Rule,” which raises the salary cap only for players who qualify through a list of criteriaheavily biased toward European players, inadvertently endorsing Europe as the most desirable destination for players looking to up their game. The NWSL Players’ Association vehemently opposes the rule. (Hayes, for her part, said that she wasn’t informed of plans for the rule before its announcement, and won’t be changing how she operates in reaction to it.)Essentially, NWSL clubs who may actually want to pursue Chelsea- and Barcelona-like ambitions are hampered by being in a league that at once wants to have ahand in everythingandresponsibility for nothing.This is not to say that the NWSL lacks strong players. This offseason has seen countless signings of top college prospects and exciting internationals, the latter group especially spearheaded bycreative additionsto expansion side Boston Legacy. Heaps’sreturn to the NWSL– where she was named MVP in 2018 – after a long period in France is a sign that the league has appeal, even for top talent. And beyond established USWNT veterans like Heaps, the NWSL remains a critical piece to developing the national team player pool. But the league is now just one tool of many in the toolbox of the US national team, no longer the toolbox itself.View image in fullscreenStar US forward Trinity Rodman is a free agent who has received interest from European clubs.Photograph: Brad Smith/ISI Photos/Getty ImagesThe flow of players between continents shows that increased investment in women’s soccer has become common enough around the world that instead of one league being the primary destination for the best players, as the NWSL was for a while, a more robust market is forming, with different leagues offering different benefits to players. That many players are interested in trying out different leagues shouldn’t be a shock. There are too many elite athletes in the world to make just one league worth watching. It remains to be seen, however, if the NWSL will be completely bypassed in appeal by top European leagues. Ultimately, that outcome is in its own hands.US Soccer has moved past controlling the NWSL, but the league is acting as if its hands are still tied on key issues. The sooner the league can rid itself of its phantoms, the sooner it, too, can move into the future.Explore more on these topicsNWSLWomen's footballTransfer windowManchester City WomenUSA women's football teamUS sportsWomen's Super LeagueanalysisShareReuse this content"

In addition to $30,000 in cash and a backpack identified in the incident report as stolen, Campbell said some guns and memorabilia also are gone.Campbell said no arrests have been made, and that no one else was in the home at the time of the alleged crimes. The incident report said the home was last known secure the afternoon of 7 January.“We’re working the case. We are waiting on some digital evidence,” Campbell said, adding that interviews also were being conducted.A business jet carrying Biffle, Biffle’s wife and two children and three otherscrashed on 18 Decemberwhile trying to return to an airport in Statesville – located about 45 miles (72km) north of Charlotte – minutes after taking off from there.Federal investigators said the Cessna C550 erupted into a large fire when it hit the ground short of the runway. Everyone on board died.No cause of the crash has been released. Biffle was one of three people on board with a pilot’s license. Investigators said during the crash’s immediate aftermath that they didn’t know who was the lead pilot on the flight.A public memorial service for Biffle, who won 19NascarCup Series races over his career, and the six others killed is scheduled for Friday morning at a Charlotte arena.Explore more on these topicsNascarNorth CarolinaMotor sportUS sportsShareReuse this content"

To assist the amateurs, the professionals in the field were given only a single serve. And to decide the server, a game of rock‑paper‑scissors was held before each point.The victory of the amateur Jordan Smith, a former US college player with a career-high ATP rank of 1,141 who now works at his family’s tennis academy, cut through much of the promotional spin. His family and girlfriend, who politely asked for half the prize money midway through the evening, gave the proceedings a human touch and imbued them with jeopardy.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz and his fellow professionals take in the One Point Slam.Photograph: David Gray/AFP/Getty ImagesA clearly overwhelmed Smith, wearing a fixed grin for much of the evening – including after beating Sinner in the third round – said at the end of the night: “I can’t even speak, it’s unbelievable,” pledging to use the money to invest or buy a house in Sydney’s inflated property market. He had been more realistic earlier in the evening when he admitted it might have to be an apartment, or “half a house”. The contrast was stark when Donna Vekic was asked what she might do with a million dollars. “I like diamonds,” she replied.The Smiths ended up relegating even the leading lights of tennis to background props for this modern fairytale. The superstar names were largely eliminated early, and those that remained shared stilted exchanges with the on-court MC, which needlessly dragged out the evening past 10pm.View image in fullscreenA box of $100 notes with the face of Tennis Australia’s chief executive, Craig Tiley, printed on them.Photograph: James Ross/EPAA trial of the new one-point knockout was run last year, but the decision by Tennis Australia to award a $1m prize this year – almost a quarter of the cheque for the men’s and women’s singles winners – built anticipation for the concept.In the field, there was a breakfast television host, a former jockey,and Nick Kyrgios. There was a video game influencer with more than 5 million YouTube subscribers. The biggest star, however, was the Taiwanese entertainer-businessman Jay Chou, reportedly worth more than $100m. He had promised he would donate the $1m prize to charity if he won, but lost in the first round to an ace.Half of the 48-player field were current professionals, headlined by Alcaraz and Gauff, while the remainder were local celebrities and qualifiers. There were regional qualifiers, including one 37‑year‑old from Adelaide who represented India at the Davis Cup in 2013, and Smith who had qualified via the Sydney bracket.The rough edges of the novel format – akin to a TikTokification of tennis – were obvious. A quarter of the matches in the first round ended with faults, and the commentators using them as another chance to talk about pressure wasn’t making the spectacle any better. Players who won the choice to receive were also given another advantage by naming the side of the court they preferred. And the whole evening was one long made-for-TV spectacular, full of commercial breaks that had players pacing impatiently and spectators losing interest. By the time of the final, close to a quarter of the arena was vacant.View image in fullscreenIga Swiatek of Poland participates in the One Point Slam.Photograph: Andy Cheung/Getty ImagesThe concept also showed its potential. Rather than the staleBattle of the Sexesformat, the One Point Slam gave women no apparent advantages. Mastering the mental side of the game helped six women to the quarter-finals, and a point between Swiatek and Flavio Cobolli – won by the Pole – offered the best tennis of the night.Though none went home with the big prize, the professional players were supportive of the format, which has been used for years in community tennis but never on the game’s biggest stage. Alexander Zverev said it was a “brilliant” thing to try “before it gets serious” at Melbourne Park, while Elena Rybakina said it was “unbelievable how many people came”.Most clowned their way through proceedings, but it meant more to others. The Spanish world No 71, Pedro Martínez, who lost against Smith in the semi-finals, immediately rushed to the exit afterwards in frustration.The field was finalised only on Tuesday with a set of qualifiers in Melbourne. One player to book their place, the Taiwanese world No 117, Joanna Garland – who won a WTA125 tournament in Canberra on the weekend but lost in the Australian Open qualifiers earlier in the week – ended up losing the final.View image in fullscreenJoanna Garland plays rock-paper-scissors with Alexander Zverev on her way to the final.Photograph: Andy Cheung/Getty ImagesBy then, however, she had won over the crowd, who appeared to initially think the softly spoken 24‑year‑old was an amateur.Her line given to the MC before the final with Smith – “there are three winners here tonight: one is tennis, the others are me and him” – was too sweet to bear. But the crowd lapped up the schmaltz, and cooed when Smith’s father said he was proud of his son, “win, lose or draw”.Of course there were no draws and the players quickly saw an advantage in choosing to receive, heaping pressure on the server. Most approached the serve as if it were their second, making many points looping baseline rallies. The exception was the French player Arthur Rinderknech who, after faulting with a powerful serve against Amanda Anisimova, gave the line of the night: “Go big or go home,” he said in his French accent, before walking out of the arena. “I go home.”Explore more on these topicsTennisAustralian OpenAustralia sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The sight of Kylian Mbappé overriding Alonso,insistinghis teammates leave the pitch as the manager requested in vain that they give Barça a guard of honour, summed up an untenable situation.Less than 24 hours later,Alonso was gone. Just seven months ago, the 44-year-old was widely seen as the best young coach of his generation. He had the pick of Europe’s biggest clubs after sensationallyleading Bayer Leverkusento the Bundesliga title. However, none of the things that worked for Alonso in Germany worked for him at the Santiago Bernabéu.Xabi Alonso failed to control Real Madrid’s egos in brief and bitter reignRead moreHow much Alonso is blamed for that will be evident in what comes next. Will Europe’s biggest clubs, many of whom Alonso spurned a year ago, come calling in the belief the former midfielder was never likely to survive the Real Madrid viper’s nest? Could Liverpool, for example, pretend that the last seven months never happened and replace Arne Slot with the manmany thought was destinedto succeed Jürgen Klopp in the first place?Considering Alonso was so careful to wait for the perfect opportunity before taking over at Leverkusen, rejecting other job offers as he bided his time, it was always surprising that he feltReal Madridwas the right next step. He may, however, get a do-over. Real Madrid never wanted a “process” coach, but someone else could.Was Wrexham’s win over Premier League opposition a sign of things to come?Ryan Reynolds had never seen such a momentous occasion as Wrexham co-owner, not least becausehe missedthe Welsh team’s third goal of alandmark FA Cup winover Nottingham Forest. Nature calls for us all, even Deadpool. The Premier League may be calling for Wrexham too.Possibly not this season though. While Phil Parkinson’s side are on a good run of form, winning their last five matches in a row in all competitions, Wrexham still find themselves outside the playoff places in theChampionship. After three successive promotions, this season may be about consolidation in the second tier. That would still be a success.Goalkeeper Okonkwo is the hero as Wrexham shock Nottingham Forest in FA Cup shootoutRead moreFriday’s win over Forest, however, may have hinted at Wrexham’s ultimate destination. There’s still a long way to go before Wrexham are anywhere near good enough to regularly compete atPremier Leaguelevel. Transfermarkt values Wrexham’s squad at €56m and Nottingham Forest’s at €602m. That gulf, however, could be bridged.This explains why Rob McElhenney and Reynolds have opened the Racecourse Ground door to outside investment, recentlyselling a stakein Wrexham to US private equity investors Apollo. The New York-based Allyn family have also invested in the Welsh club. While the win over Nottingham Forest was Wrexham’s first victory over Premier League opposition in this era, they have been gearing up to compete at that level for some time.What can Thomas Frank do to prevent the inevitable?View image in fullscreenThomas Frank’s Tottenham team have won just two of their last 12 games.Photograph: Dylan Martinez/ReutersBooing at full-time has become just as much a part of the Tottenham Hotspur matchday experience as buying a pint from the on-site craft brewery. So much so that apathy has started to dull the vitriol regularly directed towards Thomas Frank and his players. The booing afterTottenham’s latest defeat to Aston Villawas half-hearted.It’s understandable that Spurs fans are at the end of their tether. After finishing 17th last season, the north London club is once again sliding further and further down the Premier League table, winning just two of their last 12 games. Frank’s points per game ratio (1.32) is even lower than Ange Postecoglou’s was (1.52).Buendía deepens gloom for Frank and Spurs as Aston Villa progress in FA CupRead moreSaturday’s home loss to Villa closed the door on a run in the FA Cup, with Spurs also out of the Carabao Cup. Frank’s team are well-placed to reach the next round of the Champions League, but few expect them to make the sharp end of the competition. The things that kept Postecoglou in a job until the end of last season are ebbing away for his replacement.Frank can’t be blamed for everything. Spurs were in disarray before he arrived. Daniel Levy wasforced outas chair in September as a consequence of how the club was being run in the boardroom. Frank can’t answer for the transfer strategy or the lack of ambition, but he is increasingly being seen as a symptom of these problems.

It can be a desolate place, too, especially in winter, which is of course when the lobster boats do the bulk of their fishing. But the weather had improved by the time Canadian men’s national team head coach Jesse Marsch ferried his squad from around the world to Halifax, Nova Scotia, for a training camp ahead of last summer’s Gold Cup. It was the first time the men’s national team had visited the province.But it was not Marsch’s first time in town, having previously kicked off a cross-country coaching clinic – a whirlwind tour meant to share with local soccer communities what he’d done with the national team at Copa América in 2024 – at a local hotel and convention centre. He’d promised, and pitched a vision, to make the national team truly national in a way no coach had before him. And he was delivering, having also made similar coaching stops in Québec City, Saskatoon and Calgary.‘Un club d’ici’: FC Supra turns to a Bilbao-style model to keep Québec talent at homeRead moreThat summer camp in Halifax also served as an opportunity for Marsch to gather further information on his growing player pool through the Wanderers, one of eight clubs in Canada’s top flight. Tiago Coimbra, a 21-year-old striker, was in the midst of a breakout season, one that earned him the league’s best Canadian U-21 player award and, at that time, a seat alongside Marsch for a local fundraiser.Nearly seven months after sitting together on stage in Halifax, Coimbra is one of several promising players Marsch invited to his January camp in California. The gaffer had kept tabs on him. And his call-up speaks to both what the Brazilian-Canadian has accomplished since arriving in the CPL in 2023 and the ethos Marsch believes in.“I just want to go out there, give my best, get on Jesse’s good side, hopefully, and show him what I can do.” Coimbra said. “I want to give nothing but my best, not just for the national team but also for myself.”Make no mistake: Camp Poutine, as the January camp affectionately been dubbed in Canadian soccer circles, is not a normal camp. It falls outside an official Fifa window, meaning many of Canada’s projected starters for theWorld Cupare with their European clubs. Questions concerning Canada’s starting XI in June will not be answered here. But the camp is still intriguing as Marsch continues to take a holistic approach to shaping not only the national team but the country’s soccer pyramid as a whole.“I know, in the end, people are going to love me or hate me based on how the team does in the World Cup. But along the way, I take this [grassroots] responsibility very seriously,” Marsch told reporters in Halifax last year. “This is different from coaching a club team. I have a responsibility to the nation to try to do the best I can in every way possible to help the sport and I’m committed to do that.”View image in fullscreenJesse Marsch said he is using Canada’s January camp with an eye to the future of the program beyond 2026.Photograph: Icon Sportswire/Getty ImagesThat responsibility has manifested itself in Camp Poutine – a new occasion on the Canadian soccer calendar, a parallel to January’s Camp Cupcake held by the US men’s national team annually until recently. The capstone, a 17 January friendly against Guatemala, provides Marsch the opportunity to test young, domestic talents such as Coimbra (21), Atlético Ottawa’s Noah Abatneh (21) and Inter Toronto’s Shola Jimoh (17). They’re also buoyed up by some of CanMNT’s more experienced hands looking to gain traction, be it the experienced Jonathan Osorio or 23-year-old breakout Jayden Nelson.Canada’s program has in the past felt as though players rose to the professional ranks despite their ecosystem. Now, with several current and former CPLers called into camp plus strong representation from the country’s MLS academies, it feels there’s now a pipeline to the national team.“There’s a reason why we have quite a bit of the structures in our league to incentivize opportunities for younger Canadian domestic talent,” CPL executive vice president Costa Smyrniotis said. “That’s a structure that didn’t exist when a lot of these [current national team] players were growing up in the system.The CPL has had its growing pains since starting play in 2019, but Marsch has taken a particular interest, urging the league to play younger players when he scouts matches and makes visits, including to the 2025 CPL final that includedthe viral “icicle kick”.Canada’s World Cup draw provides plenty of possibility, but also pitfallsRead moreHe is also taking a more active role in players’ careers than may be expected of an international manager, having already used his connections across Europe to help find homes for his players who needed a fresh start (Ismaël Koné) or new challenge (Nathan Saliba). Marsch’s impact is so widespread and obvious that he has joked with the media that at times he feels like an agent.Coimbra says he hopes the national team spotlight can be a springboard for the next chapter of his career.“I feel like these past three years in Halifax, I’ve learned a lot and I’ve grown a lot but I really believe I’m ready for a move,” he said. “If a transfer can come from that as well, it would be amazing. I don’t want to get too ahead of myself but this is every player’s dream.”It remains to be seen how Marsch will distribute minutes against Guatemala but knowing that it’ll be Coimbra’s birthday, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see him earn his first senior cap for Canada.Yet it’s also an opportunity borne of a head coach’s interest beyond coaching Alphonso Davies or Jonathan David, and well beyond the World Cup opener on 12 June in Toronto.It’s a bond – between a coach and his players – that will only grow with time.Josh Healey is a Canadian soccer journalist based in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia.

For the other 70, they couldn’t either. Not from his team, at least. From Albacete Balompié, 17th in the second division, they witnessed something magical. An outrageous goal scored with single second to go was the perfect end to the greatest story they ever told, history made. When the final whistle went, Madrid headed straight down the tunnel, defeated again, while the party began in the Carlos Belmonte.Arbeloa had said he wanted to see Vinícius Júnior dance; instead, it was Albacete’s fans who would, long into the night of their lives. This could not have been any better; at Madrid, things can always get worse, the crisis deepening. Careful what you wish for and all that. “At this club every defeat is a tragedy, so imagine one like this,” Arbeloa said. “Failure is the road to success,” Madrid’s new manager added, insisting he was not afraid, that he had suffered eliminations even worse, but this had hurt.European football: Inter edge Lecce to stretch lead, Bayern earn comeback winRead more“It will make us better. I am not afraid of failure. I have failed lots of times in my life, with knockouts more painful than this. I saw players who wanted to win, I can’t reproach them.” That there were 10 first team players left back in the capital did not take anything from Albacete, nor make any it easier for Madrid to digest. Besides, the home side too had habitual subs playing.Three days afterlosing the Super Cup final, two days aftersacking Xabi Alonso, and one day after Arbeloa took his first session, Madrid were knocked out the Copa del Rey. And it was no fluke, no parked bus, no act of heroic resistance from a team a single point from relegation down to the third tier. Instead, it was entirely deserved, completely brilliant from Albacete and just so, so bad from their visitors and victims. Justice came late, but it was done. What a night this was, what an occasion. “Yes, we can!” the fans chanted; amazingly, they could. And what a way to do it.Quick GuideCourtois condemns 'disgusting' racist chants aimed at ViníciusShowThibaut Courtois has called for action to be taken after an online video appeared to show a group of Albacete fans chanting racist abuse relating to Vinícius Júnior before their Copa del Rey match on Thursday.The Real Madrid goalkeeper, who did not travel for the game, reposted a news clip of the footage with a picture of Vinícius and the caption: 'Enough of the racism. This is shameful!' Madrid lost the last-16 tie 3-2 against second-tier opposition.Courtois has previously spoken out against racist chanting, including in December when Vinícius was targeted by Athletic Bilbao fans. 'I think there's been a bit of a lack of respect, because we're human beings,' the Belgian said.Guardian sportWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.A goal from Javi Villar, a product of Madrid’s academy and two from Jefté Betancor, a 32-year-old Canarian playing at his 22nd club across five countries secured a 3-2 win that will be theirs for ever, echoing even louder because of who they had beaten and when.Albacete were not to be denied. Twice they had led; twice Madrid had levelled, from set plays, from nowhere, and in added time at the end of each half. First it was Franco Mastantuono who seemed to have killed off Albacete’s hopes, then it was García. But when it looked like Madrid may escape somehow, like they had some how rescued this, setting up another of thoseremontadas, Betancor was there again, racing into the Madrid area once more. There, he clipped a glorious shot past Andriy Lunin.View image in fullscreenÁlvaro Arbeloa looks dejected after Real Madrid’s shock defeat.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesMadrid were defeated, and there could be no excuses. Arbeloa didn’t seek them and said he would choose the same team again, even though he had made many changes. These players, he insisted, should be good enough to win any game. Besides, rotations are routine in theCopa del Rey, a competition designed to facilitate the progress of the biggest clubs and where they often offer opportunities to squad players and young talents. Injury had an impact too, as it has all season at Madrid. Then there was a statement to make, although reading too much into the lineup might be ill-advised.The absentees were certainly significant: Kylian Mbappé, Jude Bellingham, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Éder Militão, Álvaro Carreras, Aureliene Tchouaméni, Antonio Rüdiger, Rodrygo, Ferland Mendy and Thibaut Courtois were all left back in Madrid. On a cold, misty night in Albacete, there was no star name to come from the bench should a rescue mission was required. Remarkably, it was. Somehow, it seemed they had succeeded too, García’s late header seeming to usher in extra time.Xabi Alonso failed to control Real Madrid’s egos in brief and bitter reignRead moreDavid Jiménez and Jorge Cestero, who Arbeloa knows from Castilla, were in the starting XI. But as it turned out, the Madrid academy players who made the greatest impact here were wearing Albacete’s white. Arda Guler, Mastantuono and García also started, while Fede Valverde was in midfield rather than full-back, the position about which he had complained. Jiménez did that for him. Completing the 4-3–3, Vinícius was given freedom up front.Madrid might have been brilliant from the beginning, the change from the Xabi Alonso era immediately apparent. They also might not have been. Through the fog that engulfed the pitch, it wasn’t easy to tell. The ball was barely visible, the players mostly just figures that occasionally passed by. In his long black cloak, just a mysterious silhouette in the mist, over on the far touchline Arbeloa looked like the cover of a spy novel. It took 20 minutes or so for the fog to lift, but there still wasn’t much to see.Madrid dominated possession, with Cestero neat and tidy in the No 5 role that Alonso missed so much. By the time the half-hour came round, they had almost 80% of the possession. The problem was that they did nothing with it. Vinícius was unable to get through. Mastantuono was wasteful and García still couldn’t be seen. A long, tame shot from Valverde was all there was.Albacete offered more. Lorenzo Aguado, a former Madrid academy player, dashed towards the area and shot over and, marvellously, the first goal of the Arbeloa era was almost scored by Bernabéu. The 18-year-old Dani Bernabéu robbed Mastantuono, raced through and fired just wide. The home fans responded with a rendition of “yes, we can!” and they could too.View image in fullscreenAlbacete’s players revel in their stunning victory against Real Madrid.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesFive minutes from half-time, Bernabéu won a free-kick from which José Carlos Lazo drew a sharp save from Lunin and then, just as it looked like the rebound had set Madrid free, Vinícius running clean through, he outran the Brazilian to take the ball from him. Two minutes later, Albacete led. Another Madrid academy player, Villar, scored it, thundering a header from Lazo’s corner, the Belmonte erupting in joyous disbelief, the Albacete bench emptying.The board went up with two more minutes which had been played out when the equaliser came, Madrid allowed to take one last corner out of time from which Dean Huijsen’s header brought a superb save by Raúl Lizoain. Mastantuono finished off from close range. That might have been it, the wake-up call that restored normal service. But Madrid did nothing still, their impotence underlined when the roles started ringing round – from the Albacete fans who were soon cheering the second goal. Lunin had to save from Riki and Agus Medina but couldn’t stop Betancor on 82 minutes.History was coming close, only for García to head in an equaliser just as the 90 minute mark passed, a familiar fable of survival. But the same old story was replaced by one that was even better, Betancor heading off to make history. “We’re euphoric, this is a dream,” the Albacete coach, Alberto González, said. For Madrid, the nightmare still isn’t over.Explore more on these topicsReal MadridAlbaceteCopa del Reymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Spurs moved quickly for a midfielder they have long admired after losing Rodrigo Bentancur to a hamstring injury at Bournemouth last Wednesday, beating off competition from Aston Villa. Bentancur has since undergone surgery.Tottenham looked at Gallagher at the end of the 2023-24 season only for him to go from Chelsea to Atlético for £34m. Before thePremier Leaguegame between Chelsea and Spurs in May 2024 at Stamford Bridge, the home fans unfurled a banner of Gallagher. “Chelsea since birth,” read the caption about their academy product. The subtext was clear: do not sell him to Tottenham.Paratici talks of ‘need to be based’ in Italy as move from Spurs to Fiorentina confirmedRead moreThe climate is different now, with Gallagher determined to sign for Spurs on a contract until 2031 and play in the Premier League again after a frustrating first half of the season at Atlético, where he started only four times in La Liga.The 25-year-old is also keen to reignite his England hopes before the World Cup this summer. Capped 22 times and a member of the squad at the 2022 World Cup and Euro 2024, he last played for Thomas Tuchel’s team in the friendly defeat by Senegal last June. Gallagher is in contention to make his Spurs debut in the home game against West Ham on Saturday.“I’m so happy and excited to be here, taking the next step in my career at an amazing club,” Gallagher said. “I wanted to be a Spurs player and thankfully the club felt the same. It was very easy. It happened very quickly and I’m ready to get on the pitch. I know how great the fans are, I’m really happy to be a part of it here and want to create special moments and memories together.”Thomas Frank, the Spurs manager, said: “Conor is a top midfielder, who we have worked tirelessly to add to our squad. He is still young so has plenty of room for improvement but also has huge experience across the Premier League, La Liga and with the England national team.“Conor has captained teams so will bring leadership, maturity, character and personality to our dressing room, while his running power, pressing ability and eye for goal will strengthen us in a key area of the pitch.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurPremier LeagueAtlético MadridTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

In the shootout in the qualifying playoff for the 2022 World Cup, Salah missed his effort and Mané scored the winning penalty.This time it didn’t get to penalties, but Mané was still the match-winner, thrashing in the only goal with 12 minutes remaining. Senegal’s reward is a showdown with the tournament hosts, Morocco, in Sunday’s final.Morocco book place in home Afcon final as Bounou denies Nigeria in shootoutRead moreSemi-finals, notoriously, are not for the playing but the winning, but this was among the worst of its type. There were fouls, there was grappling, there was time-wasting, there was the feigning of injury, there were countless attempts to influence the referee, there were numerous explosions of faux outrage, there was a lot of sideways passing, and there was very little in terms of imagination or flair or quality. As a spectacle it was awful; as an occasion it held the attention only because the stakes were so high.Senegal will not care, and nor should they. Faced with an Egypt side who sat three central defenders deep, protected by two deep-lying midfielders, and showed almost no attacking ambition, they had almost two-thirds of the ball but struggled to create clear chances.Eventually, though, as they worked the ball around the edge of the box, something was always likely to fall for them and sure enough it did, Lamine Camara’s shot hitting Hamdy Fathy and spinning to Mané who controlled it and, from just outside the box, hit a ferocious snapshot past Mohamed El Shenawy. Egypt appealed for handball, but it had struck Mané’s chest. They appealed for offside but, against a defence that sat that deep, even Nicolas Jackson couldn’t stray.The goal stood and Egypt were out, having never really given themselves a chance. It was impossible not to wonder what might have been if only they had played. This is, after all, a side with Salah and Omar Marmoush up front. “We were patient and we knew that any kind of mistake would be punished,” Mané said, “so we tried from the beginning to be compact and to press as soon as we lost the ball and put them under big pressure and not to lose easy balls.”Mané was unsurprised by Egypt’s approach. “Every team has a specific way of playing,” he said. “That is their style which makes it difficult for opponents. This is Egypt.”View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah battles for the ball with Pape Gueye.Photograph: Sébastien Bozon/AFP/Getty ImagesSince their return to the Cup of Nations in 2017, Egypt have been the masters of killing games, reaching two finals despite winning only one knockout game in 90 minutes before this tournament, which was why the 3-2 victory against Côte d’Ivoire in the quarter-final seemed so striking. That was more like Hassan Shehata’s Egypt of the golden age when they won three successive Cups of Nations between 2006 and 2010.But this was like the worst of Egypt’s knockout ties as they ground their way to the 2017 and 2021 finals – and, given the criticism he has already been subjected to from senior figures within Egyptian football – including Essam El Hadary, the former goalkeeper who led the B side at the Arab Cup in December – it may cost Hossam Hassan the manager’s job before the World Cup.In a distinctly spiky press conference Hassan himself protested it was “not fair” that Senegal, having played their quarter-final a day before Egypt, had a day extra to recover. He was also unhappy that Senegal, having won their group, had been able to stay in Tangier throughout whereas Egypt, who also won their group, had travelled from Agadir.Senegal 1-0 Egypt: Africa Cup of Nations semi-final – as it happenedRead moreIt was a win that came at a cost for Senegal, with both Kalidou Koulibaly and Habib Diarra ruled out of the final through suspension after collecting yellow cards. Koulibaly went off injured in the first half, while Diarra was withdrawn at half-time. The balance of Senegal’s midfield has been an issue throughout the tournament – in part a problem of the range of options they have – and they looked brighter in the second half after the introduction of Camara, although that may simply have been a function of Egypt tiring.The first half had been dreadful, little more than a string of stoppages stitched together with very brief passages of football, interspersed with moments of a player going down and sitting, arms outstretched, looking aghast at the Gabonese referee Pierre Atcho as he declined to give them a free-kick. It was tense, nervous and bitty, a game in which no decision was too minor to be contested.Egypt, in their lack of ambition, their reluctance to trust the abilities of Salah, Omar Marmoush and Emam Ashour, had laid the path for the fate that befell them. Mané prevailed again.Explore more on these topicsAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Senegal football teamEgypt football teamAfrica Cup of Nationsmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The 20-year-old striker slammed home the rebound to the relief of the San Siro home crowd. “A great team victory – even the players who don’t play as much are always ready to help the team,” the Inter midfielder Carlos Augusto told Dazn.Milan face a tricky trip to sixth-placed Como on Thursday, whileNapoliwere held to a costly 0-0 draw at home byParmaearlier on Wednesday.The first chance of the game fell to Scott McTominay, who scored both goals inSunday’s 2-2 draw against Inter. His half-volley deflected into the side netting, and although McTominay had the ball in the net minutes later, the goal was ruled out after a VAR check for an offside in the buildup.Parma keeper Filippo Rinaldi, making his senior club debut, pulled off a point-blank save from Alessandro Buongiorno’s header, then parried away Rasmus Højlund’s shot on the turn. Højlund then failed to get his shot away after Rinaldi spilled the ball early in the second half as Napoli drew for the third league game in a row.“These are the type of games where you need to score as quickly as possible, open the match up, and then it becomes completely different,” the Napoli defender Amir Rrahmani told reporters. “We definitely need to be quicker, more decisive, bring more quality to our play going forward – not always two touches, sometimes just one.”The Bundesliga leaders,Bayern Munich, fought back to beat hostsCologne3-1 and record the best first half of a season in the league’s history.View image in fullscreenKim Min-jae celebrates his goal as Bayern Munich set a new Bundesliga record.Photograph: Rene Nijhuis/MB Media/Getty ImagesBayern demolished Wolfsburg 8-1 on Sunday but Cologne did not appear intimidated in the first half, and took a deserved 41st-minute lead with Linton Maina’s spectacular solo run and superb finish to beat Manuel Neuer. Serge Gnabry managed to level just before the break, flicking the ball into the net off the crossbar from a tight angle.Neuer parried away Jakub Kaminski’s low drive just before the hour, and Bayern went on to take the lead in the 71st minute, as Hiroki Ito headed on a deep cross and Kim Min-jae nodded in.

Their league match against Paris Saint-Germain last weekend – the first derby between the clubs in 43 years – was somewhat anticlimactic. The rivalry between is tepid, bordering on amicable, and the difference in quality was stark asPSG ran out fairly comfortable 2-1 winners. Stéphane Gilli’s men are a long way off challenging the reigning European champions over a full season but, on Monday night, that was irrelevant. Paris FC returned to the Parc des Princes and won 1-0, progressing to the last 16 of the Coupe de France at their neighbour’s expense.It was a derby once again lacking in derby feel. Jonathan Ikoné scored the winner but did not celebrate against the club from whose academy he graduated. Luis Enrique even wishedParis FC“all the best for the rest of the competition” after the match – all very cordial. The PSG manager was left ruing his side’s wastefulness as he succumbed to his first defeat in the competition since arriving in France in 2023. As far as the cup is concerned, though, PSG’s slip-up was a welcome one.PSG have won eight of the last 11 editions of the competition but, for a couple of years before Luis Enrique arrived at the club, they seemed to take their eye off the ball. Nantes reached back-to-back finals, beating Nice in 2022 and then losing to Toulouse in 2023, as PSG went looking for bigger prizes. And even in the past two seasons, there have still been romantic storylines.View image in fullscreenParis FC players celebrate in front of a dejected Ousmane Dembélé.Photograph: Loic Baratoux/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockLast season, Cannes – a fallen giant who are now competing in the fourth tier – reached the semi-finals and an easy-on-the-eye Dunkerque side, led by Luís Castro and driven by sporting director Demba Ba, also reached the last four, even giving PSG a brief scare.Two years ago, Golden Lion FC travelled 8,000 miles from Martinque to face Lille at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy, with the visitors bringing a Caribbean flavour to the dreary mid-winter in northern France. The match was a reminder of what makes the Coupe de France unique and special. By contrast, Lille hostedLyonthis weekend in what looked like the standout fixture of the round. The quality on the field was high, but only 20,333 fans showed up to watch it – a big drop on their average of 43,166 in the league.Bar a nice news story about Sochaux fans housing their Lens counterparts after their tie was postponed due to heavy snowfall, the magic of the cup has been sadly absent. Favourites have triumphed. For the first time since the 1990-91 season, the round of 16 will be contested by clubs from the top two divisions, with 10 of themLigue 1sides.Why Liam Rosenior’s time at Strasbourg was ideal preparation for ChelseaRead moreWith French clubs up and down the pyramid strapped for cash, the Coupe de France has become serious business. Clubs are still reeling aftertheir TV deal was drastically reduced. A deep run in the Coupe de France will not make up the shortfall but every little helps, especially now that the Coupe de la Ligue is no more. The winner this year will earn a modest €1.2m, as was the case last season.PSG’s surprise elimination – their first defeat at this stage since 2014 – came after a tiring week that began with the return of Ligue 1 and continued with a trip to Kuwait, where they beatMarseillein the Trophée des Champions. Regardless of the mitigating circumstances, it puts the cat among the pigeons.It is often asked how Ligue 1 would look without PSG, and while we won’t get that, we will enjoy the closest thing to it with a best-of-the-rest knockout tournament. This Coupe de France perhaps lacks the romance of recent editions, but the return of sporting intrigue is welcome compensation in its absence.Quick GuideCoupe de France last-16 drawShowLorient v Paris FCMarseille v RennesNice v MontpellierLyon v LavalReims v Le MansStrasbourg v MonacoToulouse v AmiensTroyes v LensWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Talking pointsThere were six goals at the Valley asChelsea beat Charlton on Liam Rosenior’s debut, and there were six goals in Avranches as his successor at Strasbourg, Gary O’Neil, got off to the perfect start. The Englishman described the hours that preceded his first gameas “a bit mad” and it was a frenzied game, too. Strasbourg killed their National 2 opposition in the first half thanks to goals from Joaquín Panichelli, Julio Enciso and Diego Moreira. O’Neil said he wanted supporters to know his team would “give everything for them” and, in that spirit, there was no let-up as they scored another three goals in the second half to emphatically see off their amateur opponents. After the 6-0 win, O’Neil said he wanted to win the whole competition. With PSG eliminated, Strasbourg are now among the favourites.Ligue 1 has a reputation for building careers, but two wonderkids have been loaned to French clubs this season to rebuild their careers. Ansu Fati joinedMonacofrom Barcelona in the summer and Endrick has also switched from La Liga, moving from Real Madrid to Lyon earlier this month. Handed his first start in their cup match against Lille on Sunday, the Brazilian scored his first goal, stealing in at the back post to win the tie for the visitors. Endrick says his opening weeks at the club have been “a lot better than he had imagined”. From Lyon’s perspective, his start has been better than they imagined given his lack of match sharpness. Endrick’s bid to work his way into Carlo Ancelotti’s squad for the World Cup has just begun.Roberto De Zerbi said he cried in the dressing room after Marseille were beaten on penalties by PSG in the Trophée des Champions on Thursday. It doesn’t take a lot to destabilise the balance at Marseille and quotes from the club’s sporting director, Medhi Benatia, provided a precariousbackdrop for their trip to sixth-tier Bayeux in the cup. “At Marseille, you never have time – it’s always adversity, criticism,” said Benatia after the defeat to PSG. But Marseille took no chances, starting Mason Greenwood, Angel Gomes and Amine Gouiri, and winning 9-0 in Bayeux. A banana skin avoided, they face Rennes in the next round.This is an article byGet French Football NewsExplore more on these topicsFootballGuardian Sport NetworkLigue 1European club footballParis Saint-GermainParis FCMarseilleStrasbourgfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After graduating she joined Portland Thorns and lifted the 2022 NWSL Championship in her debut season.WSL title race narrows while Chelsea and City resume winning ways – Women’s Football WeeklyRead moreAsreported by the Guardianlast week, Coffey had been in advanced talks with City having been granted permission byPortland Thornsto fly toEngland to finalise the moveand are reported to have paid around $800,000 (£600,000) for the American.City’s director of women’s football, Therese Sjögran, said Coffey’s arrival demonstrates the ambitions of the WSL pacesetters, who have a six-point lead over Chelsea.“Sam is playing at the top of her game, and I think her decision to come here shows the incredible progress we’ve made as a club and the ambitions we have moving forward,” said Sjogran.“Sam’s reputation as one of the world’s best speaks for itself, and we’re delighted she’s chosen to come here ahead of other potential suitors. We believe she has all the qualities needed to thrive at City and, more broadly, the WSL, and we’re excited to see how she can elevate our already superb squad of players.”Coffey said “City really stood out from the get-go”, adding: “First and foremost, the style of play, and when I watch the team play the girls look and seem happy, and they seem so close and connected.“I think I’m at a place in my career where I feel ready and settled in as a pro. It feels like the right time to really challenge myself in this way.

Born on the small Azores island of São Miguel, she has been in charge of the women’s teams at clubs including Benfica and Sporting, but the 38-year-old is frustrated. “We want more women coaches,” she says. “Who won the Euros? Who won the Champions League? Women – but we are losing so many.”Cabral has her A licence but is stuck in limbo. Unable to get on a pro licence course that would clear a path to more senior head coach roles in an era when women’s teams are increasingly demanding that qualification, she stepped back to become a No 2 in the US. But after one National Women’s Soccer League season with Utah Royals, she left in December in the hope that expanding her experience at another club would help to open a pro licence door.“Last season I had an approach from a club here in the US to be a head coach, but without the pro licence I can’t,” Cabral says. “I had had two offers in Spain at the beginning of the season and one in Saudi Arabia, but they all wanted the pro licence. They’re opportunities that have just gone down the drain. It’s really disappointing because this is what I want to do and this is what I’ve worked for so many years for.”One of the problems, says Cabral, is that the admission criteria for pro licence courses, which in Europe are set byUefabut can be added to by national associations, in some cases prioritise coaching in the men’s game. Another, she says, is that courses haven’t expanded to meet the demand for top coaches in the women’s game.View image in fullscreenMariana Cabral led Sporting during a Women’s Champions League tie against Real Madrid but is unable to get her pro licence.Photograph: Florencia Tan Jun/Getty ImagesCourses are expensive too, costing up to €15,000, and there is no centralised system for checking application opening times and course details, leaving coaches to go through websites federation by federation to see where they meet the criteria, when courses start and end, the requirements and even the language they are conducted in.According to Uefa the number of female coaches with Uefa C, B, A or pro licence rose to 25,000 in 2024, an increase of more than 75% in eight years.“The question that is always asked is: ‘Why more women aren’t involved in coaching?’ Well, because they try and they can’t,” says Cabral. “It’s really hard when you get to the high coaching badges, not just the Pro, but also the A licence. The pro is the worst, though, because there are so few spots on the courses. Ten years ago, or even five years ago, maybe those spots were enough to cope with the demand from men’s football, but the growth of women’s football means we have a lot more coaches on the women’s side now, women and men, but we still have a similar number of spots.”In line with the Uefa women’s football strategy, its coaching convention includes targets to improve diversity and representation on courses. Ten per cent of places are reserved for appropriately qualified female coaches. If fewer than 10% of the female candidates meet those criteria, organisers have an option – but not an obligation – to accept less-qualified women, provided they meet the Uefa minimums. Uefa also has a scholarship scheme as part of its coach development programme for women.Cabral, though, is an example of the bottleneck. “I still had a contract here with Utah Royals but I asked to leave,” she says. “My biggest goal, my first goal, is trying to get my pro licence, which has been very hard. I didn’t get on to the course in Portugal and I tried in Wales and I didn’t get on there. It takes at least a year to get your pro licence. I felt if I stayed here I would be comfortable but I would stay in the exact same place. I want to grow and if I want to be a better coach and have new experiences, I needed to go.”View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman won her third European Championship last summer, leading England to victory in the final against Spain.Photograph: Priscila Bütler/SPP/ShutterstockCabral is open to work in the US or Europe. She knows others whose coaching careers have been on hold while they wait to get on to courses. “This affects a lot of women,” she says. “I’ve talked to some assistant coaches here in the US and they have the same difficulties. Some have tried to get on to courses here, but the issue is that the pro licence here is only valid for the US and you would have to do another course if you wanted to go somewhere else.“Some other women coaches I know, in Portugal, have paused to have families and then when they come back they find it harder to get on to the courses and start to question whether this is the career for them. Then they either stop being a coach or just do it as a part-time job.Cabral says she has run into another barrier familiar in the women’s game: working conditions. At Sporting she secured a surprise 2-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt in a Champions League qualifier last season, then beat the Icelandic side Breidablik in the first round before losing to Real Madrid. But she says she and the team “suffered a lot” in a battle for resources.“I’m very outspoken and ambitious and pushed for the club to give us better conditions. It’s a difficult relationship sometimes because when a club is doing OK, they don’t really want to invest in the [women’s] team.“I quit because I didn’t want to be in that kind of environment any more. Having to fight every day for basic conditions is tough. You have to convince people every day. You walk into a room and you know that people are a little bit irritated to see you, or they sigh because they know that you’re coming to ask for something, and I’m not talking about wanting millions of euros, I’m talking about the basics, like a place to get dressed and a nice pitch that you don’t have to wait for all of the men’s teams to finish training on. The mental toll of those battles is really big.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballUefaFootball politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s not just on Rob. I’m asking Rob to do things that he hasn’t done before. When my players make mistakes, I’m accountable. That’s on me.“He made a save in the second half that was absolutely world-class. That could have put us out of the tie. He will improve in terms of his understanding. I’ll stay positive with him, as I will with all the group. My job is to help them, not to blame them.”Chelsea looked down and out after Martín Zubimendi made it 3-1 in the 71st minute. However Alejandro Garnacho gave them hope of a comeback by scoring twice after coming on in the second half. Arsenal have work to do when they host the second leg next month.“It’s game on,” Mikel Arteta said. “That feeling is not perfect but we have to value what the team has done again. It’s just half-time, and we know the big fight that we’re going to have back at the Emirates because they are a top side.”Chelsea were without Cole Palmer, Reece James and Malo Gusto through injury, Liam Delap and Jamie Gittens through illness and Moisés Caicedo through suspension. Rosenior hopes that Palmer will recover from a thigh strain in time to face Brentford on Saturday.“Hopefully, he’ll be available to train on Friday and hopefully he’ll be ready on Saturday,” he said. “If you play a player too early in January with a minor strain, it can turn to six weeks. I can’t afford to lose Cole Palmer for six weeks because he’s that good.”Rosenior added that Delap and Gittens were suffering from “dangerously high” temperatures but he is confident that the bug has not hit the rest of the squad.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupChelseaArsenalnewsShareReuse this content"

I’m not stopping.”As the 31-year-old Sanders controlled the race, more than six minutes ahead overall, he suffered a calamity 138km in to the second half of a marathon stage from Wadi ad Dawasir to Bisha when careering over one of the huge dunes at high speed.Suffering a heavy crash on his factory Red Bull KTM, the 31-year-old eventually remounted gingerly, but, badly beaten up, ended 28 minutes behind stage-10 winner Adrien van Beveren’s Honda by the finish, and dropped from first to fourth overall.View image in fullscreenSanders rides through the Saudi dunes.Photograph: Florent Gooden/DPPI/ShutterstockSanders is now 17:37 behind the new leader, Monster Energy Honda’s American two-time winner Ricky Brabec, who displayed the sport’s famous camaraderie by dismounting and attending to Sanders after the crash, and 16:41 adrift of KTM teammate Luciano Benavides.“It looks like, for sure, a snapped left collarbone,” said Sanders. “We went over a dune and it was pretty scary, and I nearly landed on Tosha [Schareina, the Spanish rider who is third overall].“I got up and knew the collarbone was broken – and also the sternum, I’ve broken this as well – so there’s no power. It wasn’t nice in the dunes at all, but unfortunately we’ve let the rally go now.”But he will fight on, even though he accepts there is now no chance of him becoming the first man for 11 years to win the Dakar motorbike race in two consecutive editions.It’s a disappointment for the man from Three Bridges, who has become rally-raid’s dominant force after winning four of the five world championship races last year.In 2022, when third overall, he fractured his elbow and wrist in a Dakar crash. A year later, his bid was hit by a bout of severe food poisoning and a thorn stuck in an arm muscle, and in 2024, he broke his leg in a pre-race training session and still went on to finish eighth.Meanwhile, Qatari great Nasser Al-Attiyah snatched back the lead in the car race to move within sight of a sixth Dakar triumph after he finished second on the stage to Mathieu Serradori.Explore more on these topicsMotor sportAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

But it happened on Tuesday midway through the Bucks’ 139-106 loss to a Minnesota Timberwolves team playing without Anthony Edwards and Rudy Gobert.“I’ve never been a part of something like that before,” Antetokounmpo said after the game. “Something new for me.”Why is Stephen A Smith blaming Renee Good for her own death?Read moreThe two-time MVP responded the same way he has whenever he’s been booed on the road. After making a driving layup and drawing a foul in the opening minute of the third quarter, Antetokounmpo offered a thumbs-down gesture and booed back.“When I get booed, I boo back,” Antetokounmpo said. “I’ve been doing it all season.”Those boos poured down after Milwaukee trailed 76-45 at the break. Never before in franchise history had the Timberwolves built such a large half-time lead in a road game.Antetokounmpo acknowledged the Bucks’ effort was low on Tuesday. He also explained why the boos bothered him.“I play basketball for my teammates. I play basketball for myself and my family. When people don’t believe in me, I don’t tend to be with them. I tend to do what I’m here to do, what I’m good at. ... It won’t change home or away,” he said. “But yeah, I’ve never been a part of something like that before and I don’t think it’s fair. I don’t. But everybody has their opinion to do what they want to do.“I’m not going to tell them what to do and how they should act when we don’t play hard. Or when we lose games, or when we’re not where we’re supposed to be. I don’t think anybody has the right to tell me how I should act on a basketball court after I’ve been here 13 years. And I’m basically the all-time leader in everything.”The Bucks’ latest loss came as they approach the midway point of a season that hasn’t met their expectations.Milwaukee (17-23) are 11th in the Eastern Conference standings, meaning the Bucks will have to rally just to reach the play-in round of the postseason. That’s a precipitous fall for a team who have made nine straight playoff appearances and won theNBAtitle in 2021.The Bucks’ precarious position means they can’t afford to have performances like the one they delivered against a short-handed Minnesota team Tuesday. Milwaukee coach Doc Rivers blamed it on “dead legs” after the game, noting the Bucks had just returned from a four-game trip and are about to go back on the road for their next two contests.“Dead legs cannot be an excuse,” Antetokounmpo said. “We have to be better.”Antetokounmpo noted that the improvement must start with him, though he delivered 25 points, eight rebounds and five assists on Tuesday. He was asked how the Bucks could step up in the second half to put themselves back in playoff position. They haven’t won more than two straight games at any point this season.“Maybe we are not connected as much as we should,” Antetokounmpo said. “Maybe my voice is just a broken record and guys are just tired and guys might tend to do what they want to do. I don’t know. But as a leader, it doesn’t matter. Being a leader is the same thing as being a dad. You have to keep on being available, being consistent with your words and your actions over and over and over again. One day you hope the message is going to go through.”In the meantime, Antetokounmpo says he will keep responding to boos the same way, no matter who’s doing the jeering.“I thrive through adversity,” Antetokounmpo said. “I thrive when people don’t believe in me. Doesn’t matter if I’m on the road, if I’m at home, if I’m at my family dinner, if I’m at a practice facility against my teammate.”Explore more on these topicsMilwaukee BucksNBABasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "11.43 ESTWest Midlands PCC ignores calls to sack chief constable now, and indicates he will take time to reach decisionSimon Foster, the LabourWest Midlandspolice and crime commissioner (PCC), has indicated that he will not sack Craig Guildford, the chief constable, on the basis of the report out today.Ina statement, Foster says that he understands, and shares, the concerns expressed by many people about the force’s handling of the Maccabi Tel Aviv fan ban. But he also signals that it would be wrong to rush to judgment.He says he did not getthe Andy Cooke reportin advance, and that he wants to give it “careful and detailed consideration”.He also points out that Cooke is due to publish a further, final report on West Midlands police, and that in his letter (or preliminary report) published today he says his views may “develop or change” as more information comes in.He says the Commons home affairs committee has not published its report yet.He goes on:It is my statutory duty to hold the chief constable to account for the totality of policing in the West Midlands.In order to give all these issues full and proper consideration, I will be taking this matter to a meeting of my accountability and governance board, held in public, on Tuesday 27 January 2026 and asking questions of the chief constable.In consideration of these matters, it is vital that all involved act in accordance with due process and the law at all times.The reference to “totality of policing” may be significance. As Vikram Doddhas reported, in some respects Guildford, who became chief constable in 2022, has a good record. The force is now solving 15% of crime, up from 3% when he took over. “Violent crime is down, and times to answer emergency calls, which were among the worst in the country, are now among the best,” Dodd says.Share"

They were also asked questions about their feelings, mood and wider mental health.The study found no evidence for boys or girls that heavier social media use or more frequent gaming increased teenagers’ symptoms of anxiety or depression over the following year.Increases in girls’ and boys’ social media use from year 8 to year 9 and from year 9 to year 10 had zero detrimental impact on their mental health the following year, the authors found. More time spent gaming also had a zero negative effect on pupils’ mental health.“We know families are worried, but our results do not support the idea that simply spending time on social media or gaming leads to mental health problems – the story is far more complex than that,” said the lead author Dr Qiqi Cheng.The research, published in theJournal of Public Health,also examined whether how pupils use social media makes a difference, with participants asked how much time spent chatting with others, posting stories, pictures and videos, browsing feeds, profiles or scrolling through photos and stories. The scientists found that actively chatting on social media or passive scrolling feeds did not appear to drive mental health difficulties.The authors stressed that the findings did not mean online experiences were harmless. Hurtful messages, online pressures and extreme content could have detrimental effects on wellbeing, but focusing on screen time alone was not helpful, they said.“Our findings tell us that young people’s choices around social media and gaming may be shaped by how they’re feeling but not necessarily the other way around,” said Prof Neil Humphrey, a co-author. “Rather than blaming technology itself, we need to pay attention to what young people are doing online, who they’re connecting with and how supported they feel in their daily lives.”Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaYoung peopleDepressionMental healthInstagramTikTokSnapchatnewsShareReuse this content"

Another agreed: “If I want a really specific person, yes.”If those who have beenhorrified by the distribution of sexualised imagery on Grokhoped that last week’sbelated safeguardscould put the genie back in the bottle, there are many such posts on Reddit and elsewhere that tell a different story.And while Grok has undoubtedly transformed public understanding of the power of artificial intelligence, it has also pointed to a much wider problem: the growing availability of tools, and means of distribution, that present worldwide regulators with what many view as an impossible task. Even as the UK announces that creating nonconsensual sexual and intimate images will soon be a criminal offence, experts say that the use of AI to harm women has only just begun.Other AI tools have much stricter safeguards in place. Asked to strip a photograph of a woman into a bikini, the large language model (LLM) Claude says: “I can’t do that. I’m not able to edit images to change clothing or create manipulated photos of people.”ChatGPTand Google’s AI tool Gemini will create bikini images, but nothing more explicit.However, there are far fewer limits elsewhere. Users of the Grok forum onReddithave been sharing tips on how to generate the most hardcore pornographic images possible using pictures of real women. On one thread, users were complaining that Grok would allow them to make images of women topless “after a struggle”, but refused to generate genitals. Others have noticed that asking for “artistic nudity” gets around safeguards around stripping women completely naked.View image in fullscreenGrok has also been used to generate deepfake images of Elon Musk in a bikini.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesBeyond LLMs and major platforms is a whole ecosystem of websites, forums and apps devoted to nudification and the humiliation of women. These communities are increasingly finding pipelines to the mainstream, said Anne Craanen, a researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) working on tech-facilitated, gender-based violence.Communities on Reddit and Telegram discuss how to bypass guardrails to make LLMs produce pornography, a process known as “jailbreaking.” Threads on X amplify information about nudificationapps, which produce AI-generated images of women with their clothing removed, and how to use them.Craanen said the route for misogynistic content to reach the wider internet has grown broader, adding: “There is a very fruitful ground there for misogyny to thrive.”Research from the ISD last summerfounddozens of nudification apps and websites, which collectively received nearly 21 million visitors in May 2025. There were 290,000 mentions of these tools on X in June and July last year. Research by the American Sunlight Project in September found that there werethousands of adsfor such apps on Meta, despite the platform’s efforts tocrack downon them.“There are hundreds of apps hosted on mainstream app stores like Apple and Google that make this possible,” said Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation expert who co-founded the American Sunlight Project. “Much of the infrastructure of deepfake sexual abuse is supported by companies that we all use on a daily basis.”Clare McGlynn, a law professor and expert in violence against women and girls from Durham University, said that she feared things would only get worse. “OpenAI announced last November that it was going to allow ‘erotica’ in ChatGPT. What has happened onXshows that any new technology is used to abuse and harass women and girls. What is it that we’re going to see then on ChatGPT?“Women and girls are far more reluctant to use AI. This should be no surprise to any of us. Women don’t see this as exciting new technology, but as simply new ways to harass and abuse us and try and push us offline.”‘Add blood, forced smile’: how Grok’s nudification tool went viralRead moreJess Asato, Labour MP for Lowestoft, has been campaigning on this issue and said her critics have been gleefully creating and sharing explicit imagery of her – even since the restrictions on Grok. “It’s still happening to me and being posted on X because I speak up about it,” she added.Asato added that AI deepfake abuse has been happening to women for years, and is not limited to Grok. “I don’t know why [action] has taken so long. I have spoken to so many victims of much, much worse.”While the public Grok X account no longer generates pictures for those without a paid subscription, and there appear to have been guardrails put in place to stop it generating bikini pictures, its in-app tool has far fewer restrictions.Users are still able to create sexually explicit imagery based on fully clothed pictures of real people, with no restrictions for free users of X. Asked to strip a photograph down into bondage gear, it complies. It will also place women into sexually compromising positions, and smear them in white, semen-like substances.The point of creating deepfake nudes is often not just about sharing erotic imagery, but the spectacle of it, said Craanen – especially as the images flood platforms like X.“It’s the actual back and forth of it, [trying] to shut someone down by saying, ‘Grok, put her in a bikini,’” she said.“The performance of it is really important there, and really shows the misogynistic undertones of it, trying to punish or silence women. That also has a cascading effect on democratic norms and women’s role in society.”Explore more on these topicsGrok AIXElon MuskAI (artificial intelligence)ChatGPTDeepfakeRedditnewsShareReuse this content"

I’m not sure why my brain assumed a bird had flown into me, but I suppose a magpie attack was more likely than a random bloke lashing out at my ribcage, so it took a second to realise what was happening.I was on my bike, waiting in a side street for traffic to clear. The punch came from behind and by the time my mouth let fly a few expletives, the culprit was leaving. Then he caught wind of my colourful language and turned back to get in my face. He was a skinhead in a bad mood. Accusing me of being in his way, he told me I was lucky he didn’t do more damage. I paused mid-reply. This was the moment I realised he was ready to go to hell tonight, and the only thing he wanted to take with him was me.I was made redundant four times in a row. I’ve coped by finding ways to surprise myselfRead moreWhen you deliver for companies likeUberEats, no two shifts are the same. I’d say 80% of my deliveries are fast food – a combination of McDonald’s, KFC, Hungry Jacks and coffee. Lots of coffee. My new workplace couldn’t be more different than the grey blur of an office, surrounded by the same walls and same people week after week. The culture shock of going from comfy chairs and morning teas to trying not to get killed in traffic was significant.View image in fullscreenThe mountain bike David Rayfield bought with the proceeds from the sale of his Xbox.Photograph: Guardian Design/David RayfieldAfter beingmade redundant four times in six years, months passed with hundreds of unsuccessful job applications. Bills needed to be paid. The big ones were still looming, but the small costs could be covered by delivering for Uber Eats. My Xbox was gathering dust so I sold it at Cash Converters and put the money towards a half-decent mountain bike.The first thing that hits you riding is the feeling of independence. In between delivering Grey Goose vodka and KFC Zinger burgers, there’s the realisation that it’s just you out there. After four months, I haven’t talked to anyone at Uber Eats. I signed up on my phone, they sent me a fluoro thermal bag, and off I went. I don’t have to worry about anybody making me redundant because there is no anybody – there’s just me. If I want to spend hours in the park eating lunch, I will. Need more sleep? That’s between me and my doona. Granted, my wages are much lower, but what value can be placed on listening to Wu-Tang Clan with wind in my hair versus dreading another company restructure?Just to be clear, my hair is secure underneath a helmet. Which was good for when I collided with a car and ended up with a face full of road. There are lots of bike paths in Melbourne, but far too many of them are squeezed in between moving traffic and parked traffic. They’re less than a metre wide and often occupied by wavering cars, massive trucks or in this case, part of a parked Ford Fiesta. Before I could react, a driver had opened their door into the bike lane without looking. I couldn’t do anything except stop my bike dead while my body crashed into the bitumen.Things like this happen too often. I tore up my knee when my front wheel got caught in a tram track (a uniquely Melbourne problem) and my cheek laid against the road as I watched one of my earbuds get crushed underneath a truck. A ute with aftermarket exhausts forced me into a gutter and my shins still haven’t recovered. It didn’t take long before I realised I could never relax on this job. My attention needs to be on 10 different things from one second to the next. My muscles are always tense, my brain always on alert. After a shift, it’s not unusual for my mind and body to immediately crash.I always knew urban planning was designed around cars but now I feel it in my bones. Not only is the amount of space dedicated to cars immense, society focuses on cars first. Shopfronts and advertisements face the road, hundreds of car parks take up thousands of metres and I avoid countless potholes in bike lanes while the cars right next to me drive on pristine asphalt.My rookie era: I used to be too timid to change a tyre. Now I build my own bikesRead moreThere’s also a stark difference between people in cars and people I deliver to. When I hand over my orders, most are friendly. They’re dealing with hangovers or excited to get their comfort food. I once said “Pizza time!” to some young kids and they cheered. On the other hand, if there’s a form of life that’s lower than cyclists in the eyes of cars, it’s Uber Eats riders.Some customers I’ve delivered to have been downright apologetic. I suppose they feel guilty for getting their Maccas order delivered when they live around the corner. No judgment from me; I still get my bonus for doing nine deliveries by 2pm. Uber Eats regularly gamifies their rewards for drivers: from week to week, they offer financial bonuses for set time periods. Let’s say you wake up on Monday and the app promotes an offer to do 30 orders before Thursday. Complete this task, and you’ll get $72 extra. It’s nice but unreliable. They’re random events based on demand and location. It can be a big bonus or a big nothing. Then it simply becomes how much effort you’re willing to put in. Another factor of being independent.Ultimately, this job isn’t a long-term solution. It’s a Band-Aid on a broken leg. The jury is still out on whether it’s better than being stuck at a desk. Air-conditioning versus sizzling heat. Freedom of movement versus monitored hours. Meetings that could have been an email versus an outdoor activity that is improving my fitness but has a very real chance of causing my untimely death. The money’s not as good but I meet nice people, get to know my city and choose my own hours.By the way, the skinhead left me alone.

Plus, tech billionaires plot against a proposed California tax on their fortunesBlake MontgomeryWed 14 Jan 2026 14.37 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Jan 2026 14.39 ESTShareHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, US tech editor for the Guardian. Today, we discuss Elon Musk’s rosy depiction of Grok’s image generation controversy; the seven-figure panic among Silicon Valley billionaires over a proposed wealth tax in California, though with one notable exception; and how AI and robotics have revitalized the Consumer Electronics Showcase.Musk’s reframeThe firestorm over theGrok AItool has been raging for more than a week now, and it shows no signs of dying down.Last week, I wrote about therising backlash against Elon Musk’s Grok AI tool, which in recent weeks has allowed users to generate thousands of sexualized images of women. Some of the images show real women, some are fake, some are nonconsensual, and some depict children, all in “minimal clothing”, as the AI tool itself described them.X and its parent company, xAI, have taken some measures to curb the flood. The social network shut off its image generation feature for users who do not pay, which constitute the majority of X’s users.Throughout the controversy, Musk has obstinately recast the AI tool’s problems as everything but what they really are. He’s been promoting its popularity as if it were a piece of productivity software. He crows about its download numbers with dubious claims. On 10 January; hecelebratedGrok reaching the top spot in New Zealand’s version of Apple’s App Store. (Rankings by the analytics firmSimilarWebof the most-downloaded apps in New Zealand, which were updated the same day as Musk’s tweet, put Grok in 14th place.) The same day, hereposteda tweet about Grok reaching the No 1 spot in Thailand’s Apple App Store. (SimilarWeb’srankingsdo not show Grok in the top 50 most-downloaded apps in the country.) On 9 January, he retweeted a post about Google searches for Grok spiking. (I would guess the increase in searches is evidence of great interest in the AI tool’s scandal more so than interest in using it.)In response to the UK’s threats to ban the AI tool, he accused the country’s government of stifling free speech. After watchdogs cited instances of Grok undressing minors, he said: “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” handing the responsibility to moderate his social network to law enforcement and courts. “Illegal” is in a court’s hands and frees him from moderating all but the most heinous content.So what’s the strategy?Perhaps to Musk, all press is good press? He may be right: his AI tool seems likely to accrue more users and few penalties as a result of the flood of nearly naked images.Grok has faced some repercussions: the UK’s communications regulator, Ofcom, has launched an investigation into xAI and Grok, and possible punishments could include a total ban. The Internet Watch Foundation, also based in the UK, announced it had found instances of child sexual abuse material generated by Grok in Dark Web forums. X’s revenue in the UK hasplummeted by 60%as concerns over content moderation and brand safety grow. Both Indonesia and Malaysia have limited access to the AI tool in response.But missing from the chorus decrying Grok are the two de facto smartphone regulators of smartphone software, Apple and Google, operators of the world’s biggest mobile app stores. Neither has indicated whether the Grok’s output violates their app stores’ terms of service. In the US, there’s beenlittle backlash from regulators and lawmakers.The lesson for Musk and other tech leaders seems apparent: the fewer restrictions you place on AI, the more shocking content you allow it to generate, the greater your engagement and your profit.Tech billionaires panic over a proposed wealth tax in CaliforniaView image in fullscreenJensen Huang speaks during an Nvidia keynote address at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 5 January.Photograph: Steve Marcus/ReutersTech’s billionaires are plotting against a proposed tax on their fortunes that may appear on ballots across California in November.Venture capitalist andantichrist evangelist Peter Thielhas already made a $3m donation to fight the proposal, according to campaign finance disclosures filed with the state. Other billionaires have started an encrypted group chat on Signal to strategize against it, which includes Anduril founder Palmer Luckey, Trump’s AI and crypto “czar” David Sacks, according tothe Wall Street Journal. It’s called “Save California”. My colleague Dara Kerrreportson the division among billionaires:Under a tax proposal that could be put to voters this November, any California resident worth more than $1bn would have to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state.Several Silicon Valley figures have already threatened to leave California and take their business elsewhere. But Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, whose net worth is nearly $159bn, told Bloomberg Television this week that he is “perfectly fine with it”.This puts Huang in stark contrast with the Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, the venture capitalist David Sacks, all of whom have recently indicated they are leaving California for tax-friendlier states including Florida and Texas.Under the proposed tax, Huang would pay roughly $7bn, and Page and Brin would pay one-time amounts of about $13bn and $12bn, respectively, based on their current net worth of $264bn and $243bn. Thiel would pay $1.3bn, based on his current net worth of $26bn.AI reinvigorates CES, tech’s biggest gadget showcaseView image in fullscreenThe Sharpa North robot uses a camera during the CES tech show in Las Vegas, on 7 January.Photograph: John Locher/APThe Consumer Electronics Show, held annually in Las Vegas for decades since its start in 1967, made global news this year.NvidiaandAMDchose it as the forum for major announcements on new hardware and software. Samsung announced a double folding phone, the Galaxy Z Fold 3, and Lego debuted a “smart brick” that seems quite fun as well. Robots abounded, rechristened as “physical AI”.It’s been quite the turnaround for CES. For much of the 2010s, hardware announcements rarely made for top headlines. New DVD players or TVs did not make a splash. Smartphones dominated, and they all looked extremely similar. Apple, the most valuable company in the world at the end of the decade, even skipped it entirely. Now, however,Nvidiais the most valuable company in the world, and it chose CES to present what’s next. Artificial intelligence and robotics have breathed new life into CES. The themes and innovations that define the convention are broader and affect more industries outside tech than they once did.Two weeks ago, Ipredictedthat consumer technology would take many strange new shapes in the coming year, which seems to already be true as we view new developments in robotics. Humanoid robots debuted at CES, including one from Hyundai and Boston Dynamics. My colleague Samuel Gibbs dubbed a laundry-folding robot one of the best things about the convention.Read more:Robots that can do laundry and more, plus unrolling laptops: the standout tech from CES 2026The wider TechScapeMeta blocked nearly 550,000 accounts in first days of Australia’s under-16s social media banIran’s internet shutdown is chillingly precise and may last some timeGoogle parent Alphabet hits $4tn valuation after AI deal with Apple‘Dangerous and alarming’: Google removes some of its AI summaries after users’ health put at riskExplore more on these topicsTechnologyTechScape newsletterElon MuskGrok AIXAI (artificial intelligence)NvidiaComputingnewslettersShareReuse this content"

I vividly remember those new-fangled boxes being spoken about often, either dismissively or with delight. A rash of cookbooks followed, and dinner changed across the land. Fast-forward a few decades, and air fryers have become the same kind of kitchen “disruptors”, offering time-saving convenience and healthier cooking, but with the added allure of easily achieved, mouth-watering crispiness.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Since launching with a single-drawer design, air fryers have evolved. Sizes range from compact to XL, while drawer configurations can be double, split or stacked. Alongside air frying, many will grill, roast and bake, and some will dip to lower temperatures for dehydrating, fermenting and proving dough. One we tested features steam cooking, allowing you to whip up dim sum as easily as a roast dinner, while another included racks for cooking on four levels.Given that the air fryer market is so crowded, it’s worth seeking out the best style for your needs – whether that’s for the simple pleasures of homemade chips or to really shake up your meals.At a glanceBest air fryer overall:Tefal Easy Fry Dual XXL EY942BG0£178 at AmazonBest budget air fryer:Tower AirX AI Digital Air Fryer£79 at HomebaseBest single-drawer air fryer:Lakeland Slimline air fryer£89.99 at LakelandBest air fryer for chips:Philips 5000 Series NA555/09 dual basket steam air fryer£189.99 at AmazonBest two-in-one air fryer:Caso Design AirFry DuoChef£139 at AmazonBest air fryergrill:ProCook air fryer health grill£129 at ProCookBest compact air fryer:Ninja Double Stack XL SL400UK air fryer£188.74 at AmazonThe best slow cookers for effortless homemade meals, tried and testedRead moreWhy you should trust meWhile air fryers have made the transition from novelty to must-have in recent years, there’s been one in my kitchen for well over a decade, and it’s in daily use. I’ve been a consumer journalist for decades, and as well as air fryers, I’ve tested air-frying health grills and ovens, multi-cookers that can air fry, and everything in between. Anything I can make chips with is welcome in my kitchen. Hang around me long enough and I’ll fill you in on what air fryers can do, how they work, common issues, and how many I’ve tested over the years (about 50).How I testedView image in fullscreen‘My commitment to the cause has seen me peel and chip more than 7kg of potatoes.’Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianBy now, you must have worked out that I take testing air fryers very seriously. My commitment to the cause has seen me peel and chip more than 7kg of potatoes – which was just as tedious as it sounds. The internet is awash with hacks for peeling potatoes, including everything from worktop gadgets to peeling hot pre-boiled potatoes with your hands – and even (and I’m not making this up) power drills and toilet brushes in a bucket. I decided a sharp peeler was the best choice.Each air fryer was run empty from cold for one hour at 200C to rate its power use. Where available, I followed the manufacturer’s instructions for cooking chips. This is because the guidance is often based on the air fryer’s capabilities. Where there was none, I defaulted to 24 minutes at 200C. The same was true for onion rings – if there was a similar frozen food, I followed the suggested times and temperatures; if not, I chose 18 minutes at 200C.View image in fullscreenFrying tonight: the chips were scrutinised on their colour, crisp and crunch.Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianAny food that looked at risk of burning was removed before it did so, meaning one or two cycles were ended early. Finished food was assessed on appearance (colour and texture), crisp and crunch, and the consistency of the batch (such as whether some items were less brown than others).The 12 machines I tested for this article are either recognisably an air fryer or an air fryer grill. I haven’t tested compact ovens or multi-cookers that air fry because they don’t offer the same experience, such as the ability to shake or turn the contents quickly, and they often don’t have removable parts that are easy to clean.The best air fryers in 2026View image in fullscreen‘Anything I can make chips with is welcome in my kitchen.’Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianBest air fryer overall:Tefal Easy Fry Dual XXL EY942BG0TefalEasy Fry Dual XXL EY942BG0from£178£199.99 at Tefal£178 at AmazonWhat we loveA stellar performance coupled with cooking flexibilityWhat we don’t loveIt’s a bit of a worktop hog, so make some roomPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£199.99 at Tefal£178 at AmazonGiven that Tefal is behind the pioneeringActifry, it comes as no surprise that the Easy Fry Dual XXL is a fantastic all-rounder, excelling at both making chips and handling frozen food. It’s also Tefal’s largest double-drawer air fryer, providing a generous capacity for families and entertaining, and it has the company’s 15-yearrepairabilitycommitment to cut waste.Why we love itWhile I remain unconvinced of Tefal’s claim that this air fryer’s 11-litre capacity will cater for eight to 10 people – perhaps if they’re not very hungry – it ticks almost every box, making it my choice for the best air fryer overall. There’s a good temperature range of 40-200C, programs for common foods, and the drawers and plates are dishwasher-safe and feel robust.More importantly, it performed excellently during testing, with the only head-scratcher being its recommendation for chips at 180C for 45 minutes, which was too long. After only 35 minutes, some chips were already slightly overdone, but the overall result was lovely and crisp. Onion rings emerged beautifully browned – they were the best of the lot.It’s a shame that …most buttons are icons – my pet hate – making it a challenge to program without the instructions to hand.Size:38.5 x 45.8cm x 33 (WDH)Capacity:11 litresPower draw:1.154kWh = 30p an hourDishwasher safe:yesPrograms:fries, chicken, vegetables, fish, dessert, dehydration and manualTefalEasy Fry Dual XXL EY942BG0from£178£199.99 at Tefal£178 at AmazonWhat we loveA stellar performance coupled with cooking flexibilityWhat we don’t loveIt’s a bit of a worktop hog, so make some roomBest budget air fryer:Tower AirX AI Digital Air FryerTowerAirX AI Digital Air Fryerfrom£79£79 at Homebase£79.99 at TowerWhat we loveIts colour screen and presets make it easier to programWhat we don’t loveOutside of the presets, there isn’t much guidance£79 at Homebase£79.99 at TowerChoosing a more affordable air fryer doesn’t mean compromising on features. Tower’s AirX comes with an easy-to-read colour screen; a deep drawer with enough flat space for a fish or steak; and six presets that use sensors and a bit of tech to take the guesswork out of cooking different foods.Why we love itRather than being a jack of all trades, this pocket-friendly air fryer specialises in fuss-free lunches and dinners more than general cooking. So if you love marinated chicken wings or a medium steak, this is the air fryer for you. The presets can be constrictive – for example, the fries preset is designed only for frozen chips – but there is a manual mode for more confident cooks.In testing, onion rings emerged perfectly crisp after only 12 minutes, the deep drawer accommodating 11 of them, and fresh chips were near perfect with consistent browning, crunch and bubbling. My only issue was that the touchscreen wasn’t always responsive with a light touch – but this might be a plus for those who dislike oversensitive screens.It’s a shame that …the drawer isn’t dishwasher safe, so some of the time you save with presets will be spent cleaning.Size:22.8 x 39.9 x 28.2cm (WDH)Capacity:5 litresPower draw:0.606kWh = 16p an hourDishwasher safe:noPrograms:chicken, fries, fish, prawns, cupcake, steak, manualTowerAirX AI Digital Air Fryerfrom£79£79 at Homebase£79.99 at TowerWhat we loveIts colour screen and presets make it easier to programWhat we don’t loveOutside of the presets, there isn’t much guidanceBest single-drawer air fryer:Lakeland Slimline air fryerLakelandSlimline air fryerfrom£89.99£89.99 at Lakeland£89.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt provides plenty of cooking space at a great value priceWhat we don’t loveParts aren’t dishwasher safe, so you’ll have to clean by handPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£89.99 at Lakeland£89.99 at AmazonIf you don’t have much counter space and don’t want to compromise on capacity, Lakeland’s slimline model is a good choice. There’s adequate flat space inside for family-size meals, or up to 1.3kg of chips, plus an internal light and a clear window to check on dinner.Why we love itI felt this air fryer was great value for money, with a good cooking capacity for its price, and it was economical to run. Its slimline shape meant food could be spread out, and I was pleased with the results of testing. Chips were golden brown, crisp at the ends and fluffy in the middle, and the batch was consistent overall, while onion rings were pleasingly crunchy. I found the window redundant once it became greasy, but it could be useful for less oily foods. I also wasn’t keen on the button that needed to be depressed to open the drawer – but it might keep curious fingers away from harm.It’s a shame that …its lowest temperature is 80C, so you won’t be dehydrating or proving dough.Size:27.7 x 42 x 29cm (WDH)Capacity:8 litresPower draw:0.674kWh = 18p an hourDishwasher safe:no, hand-wash onlyPrograms:fries, seafood, steak, fish, chicken wings, pizza, bakeLakelandSlimline air fryerfrom£89.99£89.99 at Lakeland£89.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIt provides plenty of cooking space at a great value priceWhat we don’t loveParts aren’t dishwasher safe, so you’ll have to clean by handBest air fryer for chips:Philips 5000 Series NA555/09 dual basket steam air fryerPhilips5000 Series NA555/09 dual basket steam air fryerfrom£189.99£189.99 at Currys£189.99 at AmazonWhat we loveSteam provides more cooking options than a standard modelWhat we don’t loveIt’s big: not one for those with compact kitchensPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£189.99 at Currys£189.99 at AmazonOne of only a few air fryers that can also steam your food, the 5000 Series is particularly suitable if you want to trim fat from your diet – or if you dislike the dry textures that result from overcooking. Introducing steam into the mix means it’s possible to air fry, steam or use a combination of both for moist meats, bakes and reheated leftovers.Why we love itThis double air fryer offers a lot of versatility, and I felt it was the best air fryer for chips. It’s well built, feels robust and is easy to keep clean even without a dishwasher, thanks to the self-clean mode that uses steam to loosen debris. Programming can be puzzling at first – especially as you’ll need to download its manual rather than getting one in the box – but the food it cooked made up for it: crisp, perfectly browned onion rings and chips with a moreish crunch, fluffy interior and pretty consistent browning throughout. It’s frustrating that only the six-litre drawer steams, the three-litre one being limited to air frying, but you’re sure to get plenty of use out of both.It’s a shame that …if you live in a hard-water area, you’ll need to descale this air fryer to keep it in tip-top condition.Size:49 x 39 x 40cm (WDH)Capacity:9 litresPower draw:0.79kWh = 21p an hourDishwasher safe:yesPrograms:fresh fries, frozen fries, chicken, meat, veggies, fish, cake, reheatPhilips5000 Series NA555/09 dual basket steam air fryerfrom£189.99£189.99 at Currys£189.99 at AmazonWhat we loveSteam provides more cooking options than a standard modelWhat we don’t loveIt’s big: not one for those with compact kitchensBest two-in-one air fryer:Caso Design AirFry DuoChefCaso DesignAirFry DuoCheffrom£139£139.99 at Caso Design£139 at AmazonWhat we loveThe ability to become an oven makes it handy for entertainingWhat we don’t loveYou might have to experiment a bit to get the best results£139.99 at Caso Design£139 at AmazonShort on countertop space? Caso Design’s DuoChef is a twin-drawer air fryer that can turn into a small oven. Think of it like a robot-to-car Transformer: slide out the divider that sits between the two drawers, attach an oven door, and you have another appliance altogether.As well as performing double duty, the DuoChef is packed with handy features. There’s an interior light, windows on each air fryer drawer for checking progress, a shake reminder, and a hold function so that both drawers finish cooking at the same time.Why we love itBeyond its transforming capabilities, the best thing about the DuoChef is how easy it is to program. While some dual-drawer models can leave you scratching your head, here there are just three buttons for selecting the left or right drawer or both.However, while it crisped up onion rings nicely in the allotted time, fresh fries were another matter entirely. After 25 minutes, the potato was still quite pale, with only light browning, and required another five minutes’ cooking time to reach any kind of crispiness.It’s a shame that …it’s pretty slow at whipping up chips compared with the other models on test.Size:43.5 x 38.5x 33.5cm (WDH)Capacity:11 litres (14 litres as an oven)Power draw:0.971kWh = 26p an hourDishwasher safe:yesPrograms:fries, steak, chicken, bacon, fish, vegetables, pizza, cakes, root vegetables, reheatCaso DesignAirFry DuoCheffrom£139£139.99 at Caso Design£139 at AmazonWhat we loveThe ability to become an oven makes it handy for entertainingWhat we don’t loveYou might have to experiment a bit to get the best resultsBest air fryer grill:ProCook air fryer health grillProCookAir fryer health grill£129£129 at ProCookWhat we loveThe flat space lends itself well to steaks, fish and kebabsWhat we don’t loveLots of accessories = more stuff to storePhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£129 at ProCookIf you find the flat cooking space of some air fryers restrictive, you can spread your (chicken) wings with ProCook’s air fryer health grill. It comes with a 4.5-litre cooking pot and basket for air frying, as well as accessories to turn it into a slow-cooking and steaming kitchen helper.Why we love itAir fryer grills aren’t always the most convenient for making chips from scratch, because you can’t quickly shake a drawer for even results. However, with the toss of a spatula, the ProCook ensured great consistency throughout its batch of chips. They emerged crisp at the ends and golden overall, with no pieces that overcooked and only one or two paler chips. Onion rings were crunchy and nothing stuck to the basket. My only niggle was that the settings could be confusing for a first-time user: once you’ve altered them to suit and hit start, the display shows the program’s default settings instead while it preheats.It’s a shame that …I found cleaning the basket and cooking pot a chore: it comes with its own brush for tackling greasy residue, and you will need to use it.Size:40 x 40 x 28cm (WDH)Capacity:4.5 litresPower draw:0.83kWh = 22p an hourDishwasher safe:no (basket and pot)Programs:air fry, roast, broil, bake, dehydrate, slow cook, grill, griddle, stew, steam, keep warm, manualProCookAir fryer health grill£129£129 at ProCookWhat we loveThe flat space lends itself well to steaks, fish and kebabsWhat we don’t loveLots of accessories = more stuff to storeBest compact air fryer:Ninja Double Stack XL SL400UK air fryerNinjaDouble Stack XL SL400UK air fryerfrom£188.74£199.99 at Ninja£188.74 at AmazonWhat we loveThere’s great capacity in a compact footprintWhat we don’t loveIt could be too tall to tuck it below units when not in usePhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£199.99 at Ninja£188.74 at AmazonNo article about air fryers would be complete without Ninja, which has given the world models in all shapes and sizes – most notably its stacked designs. The Double Stack XL offers capacity without a huge worktop footprint, thanks to its twin 4.75-litre drawers and a pair of racks that double its flat area, allowing you to cook four layers of food. Ideal for families, newbies and those struggling to squeeze in an air fryer.Why we love itNinja’s air fryers always come packed with guidance and recipes, and the Double Stack XL is no exception. These serve to underline how versatile it is: you could cook two whole chickens at the same time, for example – great if your barbecue’s rained off. It’s incredibly easy to program and adjust as it cooks – and the top temperature of 240C is perfect for crisping food from the freezer. That said, some of its recommended times and temperatures might be a bit off. After 26 minutes at 200C, some chips were still pale and soft, which suggests they’d need longer. There were similar results from the onion rings, which after 18 minutes didn’t have the crisp and crunch produced by the other machines.It’s a shame that …its results didn’t impress me as much as Ninja’s other air fryers have – you may need to tweak settings.Size:28 x 47 x 38.5cm (WDH)Capacity:9.5 litresPower draw:1.049kWh = 28p an hourDishwasher safe:yes – but hand-washing recommended to extend lifespanPrograms:air fry, max crisp, roast, bake, dehydrate, reheatNinjaDouble Stack XL SL400UK air fryerfrom£188.74£199.99 at Ninja£188.74 at AmazonWhat we loveThere’s great capacity in a compact footprintWhat we don’t loveIt could be too tall to tuck it below units when not in useThe best of the restView image in fullscreenThe Instant Pot Vortex Plus ClearCook VersaZone, Tower Vortx Colour, Salter Fuzion and Russell Hobbs SatisFry multi-cooker.Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianFritaire the self-cleaning glass bowl air fryerFritaireThe self-cleaning glass bowl air fryerfrom£154£154 at Peter Tyson Electricals£159 at B&QWhat we loveIt’s seriously stylish and looks fab lit upWhat we don’t loveIt’s not nearly as convenient as a standard model£154 at Peter Tyson Electricals£159 at B&QBest for:avoiding nonstick coatingsHate the boxy look of air fryers? Or perhaps you crave crispy chips but have doubts about BPA, Teflon or Pfas? If so, there’s the Fritaire. Equipped with a stainless-steel grill stand, rotating tumbler for fries and a rotisserie for chicken, it looks as if a halogen cooker and an air fryer got together and had a baby. Plus, there’s a choice of bright colours for those who can’t stand black.There’s much here to like – a “self-cleaning” function that keeps the glass bowl from becoming greasy, good visibility to check progress, and if you’re using the tumbler, no need to shake fries – but there are downsides. I found the display hard to read in bright light, and the tumbler capacity is only 500g: loading it with chips was awkward compared with tossing them in a drawer. Plus, while onion rings emerged crisp and brown from the stand, the chips were anything but. While the batch was consistent, the chips were mostly soft and slightly chewy.It didn’t make the final cut because …the exterior grows extremely hot during cooking, and stays hot for some time after.Size:35 x 26 x 31cm (WDH);capacity:4.7 litres (0.5kg max capacity of food using stand/tumbler);power draw:0.65kWh = 17p an hour;dishwasher safe:yes, accessories only;programs:frenchfries, steak, chicken, seafood, bake, dehydrateFritaireThe self-cleaning glass bowl air fryerfrom£154£154 at Peter Tyson Electricals£159 at B&QWhat we loveIt’s seriously stylish and looks fab lit upWhat we don’t loveIt’s not nearly as convenient as a standard modelSalter Fuzion dual air fryerSalterFuzion dual air fryer£99£99 at AsdaWhat we loveLots of capacity and cooking flexibility for the priceWhat we don’t loveYou might need to test and adjust for the best resultsPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£99 at AsdaBest for:families on a budgetIf you’re feeding many mouths, you’ll need a big air fryer. Salter’s Fuzion offers a lot of space at an affordable price – and thanks to the eight-litre drawer’s divider, you can air fry two foods at the same time. Alternatively, with the divider in place, you can just use half the air fryer: perfect for snacks. However, like other air fryers with dividers, it has issues with shaking: both types of food will be tossed around, and larger drawers are harder to shake.I was disappointed with the level of browning on the chips and found that the onion rings weren’t quite as crisp as they should be. Keeping its clear window grease-free may be a challenge, too.It didn’t make the final cut because …the drawer doesn’t feel as durable as it should be for this type of air fryer: its metal is thin enough to flex.Size:36.4 x 38 x 32cm (WDH);capacity:8 litres;power draw:0.912kWh = 24p an hour;dishwasher safe:no;programs:manual, chips, shellfish, steak, pork, bake, chicken, vegetablesSalterFuzion dual air fryer£99£99 at AsdaWhat we loveLots of capacity and cooking flexibility for the priceWhat we don’t loveYou might need to test and adjust for the best resultsInstant Pot Vortex Plus ClearCook VersaZone air fryerInstant PotVortex Plus ClearCook VersaZone air fryerfrom£169£169 at John Lewis£169.99 at LakelandWhat we loveIt’s great at turning out crisp and crunchWhat we don’t loveProgramming an air fryer should be easier than thisPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£169 at John Lewis£169.99 at LakelandBest for:confident air fryer cooksI’m afraid Instant Pot commits one of my air fryer cardinal sins with its Vortex Plus VersaZone: there’s no instructions or guidance in the box, but simply a QR code that directs you to videos – I’m not a fan of forcing tech into the kitchen. The Instant Pot was also one of the trickiest to program (for example, you have to switch from single drawer to dual by holding its control knob), so it’s probably not a good choice for air fryer newbies.There are some good things here, though: two 4.2-litre compartments with a divider, the ability to switch to fahrenheit, and the option to turn off the beeps if they annoy. It also produced great results, and perhaps that’s the most important thing: plenty of crispy chips – though not consistently so – and crunchy, well-browned onion rings.It didn’t make the final cut because …the display is busy and hard to read in bright light.Size:31.4 x 38.4 x 40.4cm (WDH); capacity:8.5 litres;power draw:1.187kWh = 31p an hour;dishwasher safe:yes;programs:air fry, roast, bake, grill, dehydrate, reheatInstant PotVortex Plus ClearCook VersaZone air fryerfrom£169£169 at John Lewis£169.99 at LakelandWhat we loveIt’s great at turning out crisp and crunchWhat we don’t loveProgramming an air fryer should be easier than thisRussell Hobbs SatisFry air fryer & grill multi-cookerRussell HobbsSatisFry air fryer & grill multi-cookerfrom£119.99£119.99 at Currys£165 at ArgosWhat we loveThe pot is dishwasher safe – a rarity for an affordable applianceWhat we don’t loveYou might need to air fry in batchesPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£119.99 at Currys£165 at ArgosBest for:small householdsIf you’re unsure about how much you might use an air fryer and so want an appliance that does more to earn its place on the worktop, the compact SatisFry could suit. It may stretch the definition of a multi-cooker somewhat, lacking some of the functions you might associate with one, but its spacious pot can be used for air frying and other tasks, including slow cooking and searing.There’s not much guidance, however, and the results were mixed: chips were browned but soft and not very crisp, while onion rings were doughy with some singeing. I suspect both could have benefited from different times and temperatures. The other downside is that it recommends no more than 800g at a time for air frying, so you won’t be able to use all its space for this function.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s not the easiest to program: for example, there are no separate up and down buttons for time and temperature.Size:37.8 x 32 x 28.2cm (WDH);capacity:5.5 litres;power draw:0.550kWh = 14p an hour;dishwasher safe:yes;programs:air fry,bake, grill, keep warm, roast, sear, slow cook high/lowRussell HobbsSatisFry air fryer & grill multi-cookerfrom£119.99£119.99 at Currys£165 at ArgosWhat we loveThe pot is dishwasher safe – a rarity for an affordable applianceWhat we don’t loveYou might need to air fry in batchesWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenYour air fryer should be able to cook almost anything your oven can.Photograph: Grace Cary/Getty ImagesWhat can I cook in an air fryer?While air fryers have gained a reputation for turning out perfect homemade chips and crispy food from the freezer, they’re capable of far more. Not only can you “boil” eggs, prove dough and make yoghurt (if your model offers lower temperatures), you should be able to cook almost anything your oven can. As a rough guide, for oven recipes, set your air fryer temperature 20C lower (so if a recipe states 200C fan, set your air fryer to 180C). Air fryers also cook more quickly than an oven. The time can be reduced by as much as a quarter, so check food often to prevent burning.You can press your air fryer into service for every meal of the day.

Busy day? Curl up withair fryer chicken wings with baby potatoesfor a tasty supper or a sweet treat snack ofglazed chouxnuts.What features should my air fryer have?A good-quality air fryer is an investment, so check its programs, ease of cleaning and temperature/time range before you buy. There’s no need for the lower temperatures and long durations (usually up to 12 hours) for dehydrating fruit and fermenting yoghurt if you’ll mostly be using it for air frying, for example. Similarly, if you’re a keen cook, look for one with plenty of space – a small air fryer may soon limit your horizons.For those with a dishwasher, check that drawers and crisping plates are safe to clean this way, while if you’re cleaning by hand, robust nonstick coatings will make degreasing easier.The best kettles to save energy and speed up your cuppa, testedRead moreHow do air fryers work?Air fryers are best thought of as smaller, modified convection ovens with a fast fan. Rather than having the fan and element at the rear, these are above, producing powerful fanned heat that’s circulated around the drawer.Food sits on a perforated crisper plate, allowing heat to reach the underside, while a thin layer of oil on the surface “fries” the exterior to create browning and crunch. Shaking the contents in the drawer roughens up the surface, creating more area for crisping.Are air fryers healthier than regular frying?Yes, both because you need a lower amount of oil – a tablespoon should be enough to coat a 500g batch of chipped potato, while other foods require no oil at all – but also because the way food is “fried” is different.Conventional frying uses the oil in the pan to seal the exterior. This prevents moisture from escaping, which is then heated, steaming the inside. To do this, oil penetrates the food’s surface, meaning that more fat is retained than when air frying.Are air fryers ‘toxic’?Linger on social media long enough and you’ll find worries about air fryer toxicity. It’s usually centred on plastic parts growing hot (which, as it’s limited to the exterior of air fryers, rather than the parts that come into contact with food, shouldn’t present a problem) and nonstick coatings containing Pfas/PFOA.Most manufacturers have phased out PFOA (since 2013, all Teflon products have been PFOA-free), while potential deterioration of nonstick (which may use Pfas as this is a term for a large group of chemicals) tends to happen attemperatures of 260C and above. Most air fryers have a limit of 200C, with the top temperatures on others 240C.If you’re concerned about the safety of nonstick, choose an air fryer with a ceramic-coated pan and plates, or clean yours carefully: damaged coatings are more likely to release chemicals.Another concern linked to air fryers is about cooking starchy food, which produces acrylamide (a potential carcinogen). However, the same risks apply when oven-cooking food.Cooking oil at high temperatures can also produce potentially harmful compounds. Air fryers don’t use much oil, but if you’re concerned about this, choose an oil with a high smoke point (the temperature at which oil starts to smoke and break down), such as vegetable, peanut, sunflower or rapeseed.Do air fryers use less energy than an oven?Air fryers have gained a reputation for being economical, and while this is true for the most part, it won’t always be the case. For small amounts of food, air fryers use less energy, heating up quickly and only circulating hot air within a small space. An example, a A+-rated 72-litre oven might use 1.395kWh to cook a roast chicken over 90 minutes, while an air fryer could do the same job in less than an hour and use only 0.782kWh – almost half the energy and cost.However, if you were cooking large amounts, such as a whole roast dinner – chicken, roast potatoes, yorkshire pudding, roast veggies and so on – running several cycles of air frying would cost more, making an oven the more energy-efficient choice.The best rice cookers for gloriously fluffy grains at home: nine tried and tested favouritesRead moreWhat can I do with my old air fryer?Whether you’ve upgraded from a compact model to a bigger appliance or your air fryer is no longer sizzling as it should, you may be wondering what to do with it.If it’s broken, you can recycle it.Recycle Your Electricalshas a handy postcode checker so you can find yournearest recycling point.

The former topic has fallen out of fashion now, after more than a decade’s worth of scientific research failed to proveany causative linkbetween video games and real-world violence. But studies on the positive effects of games have shown that performing complex tasks with your brain and hands is actually quite good for you, and that games can bebeneficial for your emotional wellbeingand stress management.That’s all well and good, but I’m obsessed with the concept of “gamer brain” – that part of us that is drawn to objectively pointless achievements. Mastering a game or finishing a story are normal sources of motivation, but gamer brain is inexplicable. When you retry the same pointless mini-game over and over because you want to get a better high score? When you walk around the invisible boundaries of a level, clicking the mouse just in case something happens? When you stay with a game longer than you should because you feel compelled to unlock that trophy or achievement? When you refuse to knock the difficulty down a level on a particularly evil boss, because that would be letting the game win? That’s gamer brain.I am not sure whether gamescausethis very particular flavour of obstinacy, or whether people with obstinate tendencies are drawn to video games. But almost everyone I know who plays a lot of video games is susceptible to it. It’s the part of you that simply will not give in, the part of you that’s determined to bend a game’s rules to your will. The extreme version of it is learning to play impossible DragonForce songs from Guitar Hero at 2X speed, just because you can. Or everything that happens atAwesome Games Done Quick(AGDQ), marathons of joyful gaming pointlessness in which people take on increasingly esoteric challenges, such as playing The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Maskblindfolded, or speeding through a cursed, modded version of Halo that’s full of random items from other games.It was this year’s AGDQ, in fact, that got me thinking again about gamer brain, and why we love this stuff. But I also thought about it a lot while playing Baby Steps last year. It’s a game that embraces yet gently mocks the concept of gamer brain – not least through its main character, the useless Nate, who embodies a bunch of stereotypical gamer characteristics, including being totally unwilling to ask for help.View image in fullscreen‘A joke you’re making with the player’ … Baby Steps.Photograph: Devolver DigitalTwo of its creators, Gabe Cuzillo and Bennett Foddy, told me a lot about this when we spoke in November. Baby Steps is full of moments that tease you, the player, into attempting ridiculous feats. At several points you’ll find big holes in the ground that you can purposefully fall into, just to see what happens (spoiler: nothing is ever down there). One character warns you away from a tower, telling you there’s no reason to climb it because there’s nothing at the top; of course, I immediately tried to climb the tower. Once, I spent 10 minutes inching my way up a river to a waterfall to see what was behind it; on the rocks behind the water was nothing but a crudely drawn penis.“There is a normal dirt path by a cliff that you can walk up perfectly safely, and then along the cliff is a series of wooden pegs that you could walk up instead, if you wanted to risk losing 20 minutes of progress,” says Foddy. “That’s a joke that you’re makingwiththe player, because for them to find that funny, they have to know that they’re tempted to walk on the pegs. If the player didn’t feel anything about that other than, ‘Oh, that’s not the correct way to go, I won’t walk on those pegs’, then there’s no joke. But the player gets it because they do want to do the difficult thing.”The most exquisite joke in all of Baby Steps, for me, comes when you find a pair of glasses that make invisible steps visible. If you decide to try to walk all the way across a bunch of rocky pillars to find these glasses, risking a fall at any moment that would waste perhaps an hour of your time, you will see a path of invisible steps that eventually lead to an invisible trophy. Nate will practically weep with joy in front of this trophy that nobody else can see, calling over a fellow hiker to admire it, who of course can only see Nate dancing around triumphantly in front of absolutely nothing.View image in fullscreenDogged … Nathan Drake, right, in Unchartered 4: A Thief’s End.Photograph: Sony Computer Entertainment“The joke that we keep coming back to is when the player puts themselves in a particular psychological or emotional state and then Nate gets to reflect that in some way,” Foddy says. “You’re seeing yourself reflected in this loser. That’s the deep joke: this guy, this couch potato, he’s actually you in this moment.”Cuzillo, who also voices Nate, has a chronic case of gamer brain. “Over time, we came around to this idea that a lot of the level design is an opportunity for introspection about why you’re playing the game at all, what kinds of rewards you’re attuned to and why you play games in general,” he says. “You’re asked as a player: What do you care about? Who are you as a person? If you don’t jump into the hole, you’re [left] wondering for the rest of the game about whether you should have jumped in the hole.”Gamer brain is thought of as a masculine concept, though I can attest that you don’t have to be a man to suffer from it. “I think this is a gendered type of play, toxic masculine play, or at least it’s constructed as such,” Foddy says. “That stuff is riddled through gaming culture. It’s riddled through the kinds of characters that players are asked to embody. Nathan Drake in Uncharted is determined and full of grit, but is that the same thing as being obstinate and dogged and pursuing something stupid?”Baby Steps is one of those games that you can only truly appreciate if you have a bit of gamer brain in you. Trying to explain why it’s funny is close to impossible – you have to have some understanding of the compulsion and strange transcendence of pursuing pointless objectives. But here’s the key thing about gamer brain, and perhaps about games in general: these things aren’t pointless if they actually mean something to you.What to playView image in fullscreenComforting, achievable January play … Sword of the Sea.Photograph: Giant SquidWhen I startedSword of the Sealast night and found myself surfing over dunes of tastefully rendered animated sand, I immediately thought ofJourney. Alotof this game brings Journey to mind, from the art style and animation to the minimal demands that it makes of you as a player. But you know what? It’s been almost 15 years since that landmark PlayStation 3 game, and it’s been lovely to play something that channels its best moments. You swoosh around the desert, occasionally jumping, occasionally pressing square to make something happen, finding places where your magical sword can bring water back to your arid surroundings. After you’ve flooded the former desert, you surf around on the water instead, ocean creatures flitting around you.

A system that sends paramilitaries on to the streets will observe no limitsWed 14 Jan 2026 12.46 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Jan 2026 14.52 ESTShareAfew years ago, towards the end of the second Obama administration, a friend and her wife flew back to New York from a holiday in Mexico, landing for a connecting flight in South Carolina. At immigration, the officer looked from one to the other, asked their relation to one another and on receiving the reply, made a noise of disgust – “ugh”. On the pretext that American citizens can’t go through the same lane as a spouse on a green card (not true), he sent them to the back of the line, causing them to miss their connection. But that’s not the point of the story.My friend is a white Australian who is generally conflict-averse; her wife is a Japanese-American who can stop traffic with a single, hard stare, and who teaches in the South Bronx, where many of her students have been harassed by law enforcement since the day they were born. As trouble got under way, my friend kicked off like a good’un, swearing and muttering sarcastically in the Australian style, while her wife shot her desperate, angry looks. Shut up. Shut Up. SHUT UP.I have been thinking about this incident a lot since the death last week of Renee Good, the Minnesota womanfatally shotby an ICE agent. The use of deadly force was justified on grounds of self-defence, according to the US administration. That explanation doesn’t appear to be borne out by the videos, but the thing I also keep thinking about is the way in which, immediately prior to the shots being fired, Good and her wife, Becca, addressed the agent. “You wanna come at us?” says Becca, in the agent’s general direction. “I say go get yourself some lunch, big boy.” When the officer approaches Good’s open car window, she smiles, addresses him as “dude” and says mockingly: “I’m not mad at you.”It goes without saying that in a healthy democracy, mouthing off at authority shouldn’t constitute putting oneself in mortal danger; sarcasm is my stress response, too. But this assumes that civic norms apply. This is the US, where even in normal times use of deadly force by cops isn’t an infrequent occurrence – a conservative estimate by the University of Illinois puts theaverage numberof people killed annually by US law enforcement at 600. We may not yet have all the facts surrounding what motivated the ICE agent to use deadly force, but on the evidence of the videos alone, it seems to me apparent that both Good and her wife made a single, terrible,understandable miscalculation: they underestimated the danger they were in.Some commentary on the right has suggested that the jocular tone adopted by the women is an indication of their political glibness; that they were somehow “playing” at protest. I don’t think this is true. It did, however, suggest a sheltered understanding of the country they’re living in, and one that isn’t unique to their side. The invasion of the US Capitol on January 6 by crowds, some dressed for a costume party, resulted inthe death of Ashli Babbitt, the Maga martyr who was shot and killed by police. Participating in a violent mob invading the seat of government isn’t the same thing as driving away from law enforcement. But in both cases, apparently deeply felt political convictions were expressed with a levity – a larky tone of protest – premised on assumptions of safety.It’s a devastating misapprehension. A few years after my friend’s trouble in South Carolina, I was pulled out of the passport line at JFK airport and made to sit in a side room for questioning. My indignation was total. I swore, I carried on. As my two toddlers screamed, I felt the phrase “I’m a British citizen!” bubble up through my system like a character from a Paul Scott novel. After three hours with no toilet or phone access, I was released to go home, whereupon I relayed the story to my partner at the time as if returning from war, a conquering hero.She looked at me coldly. “You’re a fucking idiot,” she said, when I told her how rude I’d been. “What if they’d asked you where the girls’ father is? And why aren’t you travelling with their birth certificates?” I couldn’t believe that I was getting grief off this person who has never met a cab driver she couldn’t start a fight with – but then, her antecedents were murdered by Nazis. She understands a real threat when she sees it. Nothing should take away from Good’s courage or convictions. But there are lessons to be learned: a system that puts paramilitaries on US streets to round people up willy-nilly should be approached by those protesting with the understanding that there is nothing – nothing – it won’t do to shut them up.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We need urgent reformAlex DuranIt shouldn’t take suing departments of corrections or capturing atrocities on illegal cellphones to see what happens behind prison wallsWed 14 Jan 2026 10.00 ESTShareWhen a camera records an act of lethal violence against someone in official custody, the state cannot hide what it typically keeps in the dark. That’s what happened when correction officers murdered Robert Brooks at Marcy correctional facility inNew York. Restrained in handcuffs, Brooks was beaten to death by officers unaware that their own body-worn cameras were documenting every blow.The deaths of Brooks and another handcuffed man, Messiah Nantwi, were the catalysts of a recentinvestigationby the New York Times that found guards in New York prisons use violence at alarming rates. Because the public is largely unaware of what their tax dollars fund behind prison walls, these revelations are significant. But the violence is not unique to New York.The states that lock up the most people – Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Alabama – are the places where watchdogs keep uncovering horrific conditions, from medical neglect that has killedat least 50 people, to jail systems like Mississippi’s where authorities literally cannot sayhow many people have died. Oversight is sometimes the only thing ensuring a prison sentence does not become a death sentence.I know how easily cruelty becomes routine when no one is watching. I served 12 years inNew Yorkstateprisonsfor a Bronx shootout that left one man dead.Basic oversight is the exception, not the rule. A 2024 overview by the National Conference of State Legislaturesfoundonly 19 states have “fully independent, permanent” prison-oversight bodies that meet a basic standard of external accountability.There is one way to pierce the opacity of our prison systems, however. Contraband cellphones, smuggled in by guards and sold to prisoners on the black market, can capture these deplorable conditions in grainy, devastating detail.Nowhere is this violence more overwhelming than inAlabama, where close to 300 incarcerated people died in 2024. More than 100 perished in just the first half of 2025. Andrew Jarecki and Charlotte Kaufman’s new documentary The Alabama Solution, which I co-produced, uses this footage to reveal a system so lawless and predatory that the state fights harder to criminalize and block cellphones than to confront the cruelty they expose.The Hobbesian world of Alabama prisons – men bleeding from stab wounds, others strung out on drugs, slumped against walls, convulsing, or lying totally still – was intimately familiar to me. After I was released in 2016, similar memories haunted my mind. Nights when a man’s screams ricocheted down the tier as he was beaten by guards. Mornings when we’d wake to someone dangling from a bedsheet after begging for mental health care that never came. Smells of Corcraft germicidal cleaner mixing with blood after a stabbing. Once home, I was often at a loss for words when asked what prison was like. How do you convey the terror of lying in your bunk, counting the footsteps of guards approaching? How do you explain the particular silence that follows watching a man get dropped to the concrete, coughing up teeth?When I watched the cellphone footage from Alabama’s prisons, I recognized my own experiences. This is the achievement of fearless incarcerated men in the film like Melvin Ray and Robert Earl Council Jr, who weren’t just documenting harm, but imagining a different kind of system.The brutality we see in many state prisons is a choice. This summer, on a visit to theMainestate prison, I witnessed men use email, Zoom and other digital tools as part of programs instituted by Randall Liberty, the forward-looking Maine corrections commissioner. When prison leadership has nothing to hide, incarcerated people have access to technology that would make it easy to document abuses.New York has recently taken a step in the right direction. The governor, Kathy Hochul, signed a long-fought overhaul of the State Commission of Correction, the body charged with ensuring that jails and prisons are safe and humane. The new law expands the commission from three to five members and for the first time mandates that people with lived experience of incarceration and expertise in public and behavioral health be included. What happens next will determine whether this reform becomes real or simply another layer of bureaucracy designed to absorb outrage while leaving violence untouched.The cruelty we see in New York and Alabama is fundamental to America’s very beginnings. After the revolution, early reformers declared the gallows barbaric and imagined prisons as a “civilized” alternative. But from the start, these cages were filled with people pushed to the margins of a new nation, and mortality rates rivaled the colonial punishments reformers claimed to leave behind. Two and a half centuries later, our prisons are still deadly, still in need of reform.It shouldn’t take suing departments of corrections or capturing atrocities on illegal cellphones to see what happens behind prison walls. The US supreme court justice, Louis Brandeis, famously stated that “sunlight is the best disinfectant.” Nowhere is the bright light of transparency more urgently needed than in our prisons.Alex Duran is program director at Galaxy Gives and a co-producer of The Alabama SolutionExplore more on these topicsUS prisonsOpinionUS politicsNew YorkAlabamaMainecommentShareReuse this content"

Already, the federal investigation into the killing raises serious concerns, which is why the parallel investigationMinnesotaofficials are conducting is vital.Mere hours after Good’s death, theTrump administrationprejudged the case before any investigation could begin. The administration was swift to blame the victim, with thepresidentand theDHS secretarymaking disparaging, accusatory, and prejudicial statements about her motives and conduct; Donald Trump said she was a “professional agitator” who had “viciously” run over the officer, while Kristi Noem accused her of “domestic terrorism”. Additionally, JD Vance, the vice-president,incorrectly claimedthe shooter had “absolute immunity” from criminal prosecution by state officials. And the FBI hasshut state investigators out.2026 is already pure chaos. Is that Trump’s electoral strategy? | Moustafa BayoumiRead moreThese responses are not the way government officials should ever treat a use of deadly force by a law enforcement officer, much less before investigating. And indeed, the administration’s claims – made within 24 hours of the killing – are not consistent with what isknownabout Good and her actions.As former federal prosecutors who spent decades in the justice department’s civil rights division investigating law enforcement uses of force, we know that an incident like this must be followed by a credible investigation that produces a complete explanation of what happened and why – and who, if anyone, needs to be held accountable.Constitutional democracy depends on ensuring that those who exercise government power do it lawfully. Even when a use of force turns out to be legally justified, meaningful investigations make us all safer – the public and law enforcement officers alike. Credible investigations can deter violence by ensuring consequences for illegal acts, build public trust in law enforcement and help prevent future loss of life. Even if the federal government brings no charges, the public deserves an account of its investigative efforts and decision. The Department of Justice – including during the first Trump administration – has provided this transparency following previous investigations into law enforcement violence, as in the cases ofFreddie Gray,Tamir RiceandMichael Brown.The Trump administration has made clear that it will not meaningfully investigate violence by federal officersAs the current administration’s justice department has all but abandoned its responsibility to ensure federal officers respect the constitution, and as administration officials’ remarks suggest that only one outcome of its investigation is acceptable,Minnesotaofficials have announced an independent review of the fatal shooting. The state should continue to press forward with its investigation even in the face of federal obstruction, and other state and local jurisdictions should prepare to follow suit.The administration has made clear, even before last week, that it will not meaningfully investigate violence by federal officers. It hasdecimated our former office, the civil rights division, once home to a wealth of experts with decades of experience in handling these investigations, and it has reportedlyexcludedthe few who remain from this investigation. Veteran federal criminal prosecutors in Minnesota and our former office havereportedly quitover how the investigation is being handled.The justice department appears to have ignoredalleged uses of excessive forceby federal agents over the past year in Chicago, Los Angeles, Portland, the District of Columbia and other cities, including a series of incidents in which federal officers deployed rubber bullets and pepper balls against clergy, journalists and peaceful protesters. In Chicago, afederal judge foundnot only that agents had used excessive force but that some, including a senior border patrol official, had lied about it under oath. So even as the Department of Justice claims it is investigating the Minnesota shooting, the public should hesitate to trust the outcome.Against this backdrop, states and localities can and should step forward to fill the void. Like in Minnesota,officials in Oregonare now investigating two recent ICE shootings in Portland. Given the Trump administration’s rush to judgment, state and local law enforcement are right to conduct their own investigations. If the federal government attempts to deny these authoritiesaccess to witnesses and other evidence, there is much that states can do even in the face of federal obstruction, including interviewing bystander witnesses, consulting with use-of-force experts, gathering publicly available information on federal policies and procedures, and enhancing and analyzing available videos of violent incidents.State governments should also consider creative solutions, including a so-called“universal constitutional remedies” actthat allows individuals to hold federal officials accountable for violating the constitution, andaccountability commissions, to document unlawful conduct by federal agents and make recommendations for legal and policy changes to better protect state residents.What’s happening in Minnesota is a culmination of months of aggressive tactics by ICE in cities and states across this country. In this moment, we cannot rely on this administration to conduct fair and thorough investigations – but we can and should look to state and local leaders. Their efforts are crucial to keeping our communities safe and seeking accountability.Kristy Parker is a former prosecutor in the justice department’s civil rights division and current special counsel at Protect Democracy.

But to understand whyRenee Nicole Good was killedon Wednesday, why the White House has designs onGreenland, and why the people ofVenezuelamay soon be governed, in effect, by a junta of oil companies backed by the US military, we should also consider anemailMartin Peterson, a philosophy professor at Texas A&M, received about his course Contemporary Moral Problems last week.His syllabus, he was informed, contained material banned by the college’s board of regents in December – part of thewaveof censorship the Trump administration and the Republican party have encouraged at universities across the country. He was given two options: change the syllabus “to remove the modules on race ideology and gender ideology, and the Plato readings that may include these” or teach another course.The offending material included selections from Plato’s Symposium, one of his most important and widely read works. In it, the philosopher Socrates and his companions at a banquet discuss the nature of love. And in one passage, the playwright Aristophanes offers an account of how love and sexuality came to be. There were once three sexes, he says – male, female and androgynous – and all humans were, at first, physically joined pairs. But after we mounted an attack on the gods, Zeus split us in two, and we’ve ached to complete ourselves with partners – ⁠of the same or another sex – ever since.The “gender ideology” of this tale comes to us from the fourth century BC. And philosophers in the many centuries since have examined it not only for what it tells us about the Greeks in Plato’s day but for what it might tell us, as far removed as we might be from ancient Athens, about sex, love and longing. It is a tale about universal aspects of the human experience philosophers have examined in the service of understanding what it means to be a human being.Trump is marching into 2026 with the worst cabinet in history | Austin SaratRead moreThe efforts to answer or speak to that question ⁠are the highest and best accomplishments of what we’ve come to call “western civilization”. The coherence of thought implied by that phrase – invoked so often by a movement now cancelling Plato – have been belied by the bitter and bloody conflicts, often animated by philosophical and theological divisions, that characterized most of western history until very recently. But our disputes over what it means to be human have been fought out atop a consensus – a consensusDonald Trumpand the American right now challenge daily – ⁠⁠that the question itself is of transcendent importance.This year marks the 250th anniversary of the American answer to it – the idea that human beings are equal, possessed of a universal dignity that entitles us to basic rights and a chance to flourish and prosper, whoever we may be. That idea has always had flag-waving enemies. And today, the latent belief of the nativists vying to make America great again is that there is nothing especially interesting or consequential about the American project.America,JD Vancetells us, is merely a nation like many others ⁠– a “homeland”, he said upon accepting his nomination to the vice-presidency, for “people with a shared history and a common future”. That’s a vision of American identity that would have described bands of cavepeople in skins just as well or better. Stephen Miller’s proleptic defense of seizing Greenland last week suggests the Trumpists themselves know this. “We live in a world, in the real world ... that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power,” hedeclared. “These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.”Miller’s laws are the laws of animals. It is true, obviously, that high ideals have long been deployed to obscure or justify predation, here and elsewhere. But Miller’s stance and the stance of the administration is that there aren’t, actually, any high ideals worth pursuing or even pretending to – that the human being, in itself, is nothing so much ⁠and that we are, fundamentally and forever, primitives.Stephen Miller wants us to fear him | Arwa MahdawiRead moreAgainst the demands and best aspirations of civilization – western or any kind – they tell us the human being is a creature that yearns for nothing more than blood and soil, which is, of course, just mud. The lust for mud has taken up many guises in our history and has been many given names of late – neo-reaction, post-liberalism, fascism. But the name familiar to most is evil.It was evil – the standpoint that only might matters, that human morality, and our sense of reality itself, must yield to the turfism of the primates with the biggest clubs – that ginned up the propaganda that provoked an act of terrorism against our legislature and the policemen defending it five years ago.It is evil that undergirds pronouncements from the same voices responsible for that attack, in defense of the man who shot Renee Nicole Good, that those who disobey the commands of law enforcement, however unsound or unjust, deserve summary execution – that implies, as Fox’s Jesse Watters and others have, that Good’s killing was of trivial significance because she was a lesbian “with pronouns in her bio”.It is evil that sendsinnocentmen to foreign gulags, evil that condemnshundreds of thousandsof destitute people abroad to death without a moment’s discussion or debate about what the country they had depended on might owe them, or the furnishing of alternative arrangements for their wellbeing.The gutting of USAID remains this administration’s worst and least surprising offense against the human conscience – a president who rejects the idea that we might have obligations to all within our society can’t be expected to wonder or worry about whether we have obligations to those outside of it. This is also why, after all the noise and nonsense about the need to depose the Maduro regime, the Venezuelan people are now beingtoldthat regime will be left mostly in place for as long as it takes to secure and extract the country’s resources on our terms – that Venezuela will not see democracy unless and until it is profitable for the United States.Democracy has always been a useless abstraction to those who deny we have basic human entitlements – for those who believe, instead, that the idea of human liberty is a luxury for those wealthy and powerful enough to consider themselves our betters rather than the birthright of all.As many who have taken to the streets in protest have noted, the Trump administration’s assaults on liberty here at home are the kinds of abuses that spurred the revolution we will commemorate this year. But no grand revolution is in the offing this time around. The only just and plausible recourse for our situation is politics – understood not merely as the contest to win any given set of elections but as the broader fight to forge a republic that honors and strengthens our humanity. The American project must and will succeed. Its enemies stand for too little. Our lives are worth too much.Osita Nwanevu is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionUS politicsUS educationUS universitiesTrump administrationPlatoPhilosophycommentShareReuse this content"

Steve Kerr and Doc Rivers, the head coaches of the Golden State Warriors and Milwaukee Bucks respectively,described Good’s death as “murder”. Kerr also attacked the Trump administration’s attempts to portray Good as a terrorist.Etan Thomas“It’s shameful that the government can come out and lie about what happened when there’s video and witnesses who have all come out and disputed what the government is saying,” Kerr said.Meanwhile, a fan at the Minnesota Timberwolves home game on Thursday yelled “Go Home ICE” duringa moment of silencefor Good. Many in the crowdresponded with cheers.Most rational thinking people, then, seem to be in agreement on the subject. And then there’s Stephen A Smith. The ESPN hot-take machine seemed to align himself with the Trump regime’s assessment of Good’s death. Here arehis exact words.“I saw the video on numerous occasions and seeing what transpired from a lawful perspective as it pertains to a law enforcement official, don’t expect him to be prosecuted. He was completely justified,” Smith said.“From a humanitarian perspective, however, why did you have to do that? If you could move out the way, that means you could have shot the tires. That means you could have got a few feet away after you shot the tires. And if you were unsuccessful in doing that, you could have got her down the road.“You didn’t have to do that. She wasn’t driving down the road coming at you 90 miles an hour. She was parked in the middle of the street, and rather than get out the car, she wrongfully tried to drive off and wrongfully disregarded a law enforcement official, which is exactly what ICE is, and, as a result, lost her life because of it.”Warriors’ Steve Kerr rips US government’s response to ICE ‘murder’ in MinneapolisRead moreMaking the argument that a woman who posed absolutely no immediate threat at the same time deserved to be shot in the face is as disheartening as it is illogical. Like so many of the Maga crowd, who don’t seem to take as harsh a line on the January 6 rioters who definitely didn’t comply with law enforcement when they stormed the Capitol, Smith’s rhetoric appears to be blaming Good for her own death when he emphasizes she “wrongfully disregarded an order”.Understandably, this brought on swift condemnation of Smith. Don Lemon described him as a “disappointment”, while former ESPN personality Keith Olbermann called for his firing.Veteran broadcaster Soledad O’Brien said thatSmith simply does not understand many of the topics he speaks about once he strays from sports. “Stephen A Smith consistently jumps into issues, whether it’s politics or social issues, or in this case a legal issue that looks at how law enforcement is supposed to react, with zero knowledge or expertise and happily weighs in,” she told me.In response,Smith saidhis words had been twisted and reported out of context. “I’m talking about legality when I’m talking about justification, nothing else,” Smith said. “Everything else about it is wrong. Morally and ethically wrong.” But he still maintained much of his original position. “In the moment when you are dealing with law enforcement officials, you obey their orders so you can get home safely,” he said one day later in a lengthy segment designed to clean up his original remarks. “Renee Good did not do that.”The problem is that just because something is a law does not mean that it is just. Yes, law enforcement officials often escape punishment because of qualified immunity. But as Chuck Modi, my co-host on The Collision: Where Sports And Politics Collide,points out: “If you’re going to make that point, the next thing out of your mouth should be that that is a terrible law. And he didn’t say that.”If Smith doesn’t condemn the law, the message he is sending is that, in his not so humble opinion, the law is OK. It’s important to remember that every law is not a good law. The Jim Crow laws were legal. Slavery was legal for much of America’s history. Stating that something is legal, without any further exploration, isn’t enough.Smith is beginning to sound like another media figurehe has long attacked: Jason Whitlock. Both haveechoed Maga talking points, positioning themselves as the Black faces figures on the right can point to and say,“See, he agrees with us, so we can’t be racist.”It’s why Maga platforms welcome them so readily – they are seen as allies, on their side, the “good ones”.Smith and Whitlock are not unaware of any of this. “Stephen A Smith has done the math,” O’Brien told me. “This is what you have to say if you want to have the audience that he is trying to build. A rabid audience that will stand by you. And that audience has a financial value. I’m past being disappointed.”My hope is that one day Smith and Whitlock experience the kind of personal and racial reckoning depicted at the end of Spike Lee’s Bamboozled, when Manray, played by Savion Glover, looks in the mirror and realizes he can no longer wear blackface and tap dance for a white audience that has rewarded him with fame and fortune. That Smith and Whitlock come to see that the gold coins and head pats from Maga hands are no longer worth the cost, and finally hang up their tap shoes for good. But I won’t hold my breath.Explore more on these topicsUS sportsMinnesota ICE shootingESPNNBAICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)commentShareReuse this content"

That idea informs the “Donroe Doctrine” behind the US invasion ofVenezuelato seizeNicolás Maduro.Donald Trumpseems to believe that, as the world’s strongest military power, the United States should be allowed to invade other countries at will. Trump’s homeland security adviser, Stephen Miller,says“the real world” is “governed by strength”, by “power”, so we should get used to it.There is a beguiling simplicity to this abandonment of the norms long designed to govern the behavior of states big and small. China hastoutedit as the reality that its Asian neighbors must live with. Russia, a third-tier power bycomparisonbut still a nuclear-armed regional heavyweight, has periodically treated the boundaries of post-Soviet states as mere suggestions. But do we really want to return to the law of the jungle in which the guy with the biggest stick calls the shots?Trump’s distaste for any constraints on US power did not emerge in a vacuum. The US government has long considered international law to be what Lilliputians use to restrain Gulliver. That wariness lies behind, for example, Washington’s reluctance to accept international standards that most others view as benign, such as the First AdditionalProtocolto the Geneva Conventions (articulating modern standards for warfare and ratified by175states), theConventionon the Rights of the Child (the US is theonlynation in the world not to have ratified it) or the Law of the SeaTreaty(171state parties). Joining the international criminal court (ICC) isdeemedbeyond the pale.To some extent, spheres of influence have long existed. The United States has dominated the western hemisphere, while China held significant sway in parts of Asia andRussiain the countries of the former Soviet Union. On occasion those big powers flexed their military muscles without regard to international law – the United States to invade Iraq, for example, Russia to seize chunks of Ukraine and Georgia, China to fence off much of the South China Sea. But these forays have been exceptions, justified with allusions to Saddam’s supposed weapons of mass destruction, Putin’s stated fear of Nato expansion or China’s historical territorial claims. Trump is proposing a more unabashed return to great-power spheres of influence enforced largely by coercion.Drugs and gangs exist in Venezuela, but don’t be fooled. Trump arrested Nicolás Maduro to plunder our wealth | Andrés AntillanoRead moreIn the past, the US government at least nominally portrayed its dominance as aimed at upholding democracy and the rule of law. Despite the many exceptions, Washington spent enough time promoting a rights-based world order that its hegemonic role seemed more palatable. Under Trump, that is all history.The highlights of Trump’s policy toward Latin America are illustrative. He has backed former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro despite his attempt to overthrow the country’s democracy, praised El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, as he decimates the rule of law and detains young men in cruel conditions with limited due process, forced immigrants to return to dangerous and tumultuous countries, and now seized Venezuela’s oil. That is not an agenda designed to win hearts and minds.But since the United States has long had the world’s most powerful military and biggest economy, why should Washington bind itself by international law rather than order others around? Trump promised to end “forever wars”, but seems to have calculated that there is nothing wrong with a quick win here or there, a return to “gunboat diplomacy”, if it brings a short-term political advantage.But what would a world dominated by unrestrained force look like? The crime of aggression – the basic rule against invading or subjugating other states – would not disappear altogether, but it would be badly weakened. The international system already struggles to hold powerful countries accountable when they invade their neighbors. Trump’s vision would turn that weakness into a governing principle.For example, the ICC would retain the power to prosecute aggression, but its jurisdiction is limited. For most crimes in its remit, it can prosecute leaders of non-member states so long as the relevant conduct takes place on the territory of a member state. That is the basis for the ICC’s jurisdiction over Israeli war crimes in Gaza and Russian war crimes in Ukraine. But for the crime of aggression, the court has jurisdiction only over the citizens of governments that grant it that power, which the United States, Russia andChinahave not done.Similarly, the UN general assembly could continue to denounce acts of aggression, as itdidfor Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But with the UN security council stymied by the permanent members’ veto, the UN’s coercive capacity is unavailable to address the conduct of the three governments most likely to aggressively claim a sphere of influence.As the ability to uphold the law against aggression diminishes, weaker governments will begin to adjust. In a might-makes-right world, US allies, not to mention the emerging powers of the global south, would begin to hedge their bets. If an alliance with Washington meant a feudal relationship with a powerful overlord who could turn against you on a whim, why not balance Washington against others? In a transactional world where Trump threatens to seize Greenland, or conditionsUS militarysupport for Nato members on his evaluation of their military expenditures, Europe would become more accommodating of Russia. Japan, South Korea and much of the rest of Asia would draw closer to Beijing. The consequences would be harmful for the defense of human rights, economic predictability and the stability of smaller states.Should Americans care? To begin with, the United States has enormous economic interests in these regions that it will lose by alienating allies. Does it really want Europe building its military by shunning American arms or Taiwan prioritizing semiconductor sales to Beijing? Yes, Trump would dominate Latin America, but ithasonly 13% of the world’s population and a diminishing share of the global economy. Much of the world’s dynamism and growth lie elsewhere.As Washington tramples norms, alliances might give way to grudging partnerships, with allies slow-walking their commitmentsMoreover, spheres of influence must be defined, with predictable friction along the edges, as illustrated by the many cold war proxy conflicts in a Yalta-divided world. To keep the peace, the United States currently depends on a global network of bases and a series of military alliances, but as Washington tramples norms, alliances might give way to grudging partnerships, with allies slow-walking their commitments or finding excuses to step aside.Africa, for example, with its ample supply of critical minerals and one of the world’s few regions of population growth, is already contested by the United States, Russia and China, as well as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Trump’s imperialist rhetoric is unlikely to play well on a continent with recent memories of colonialism.A might-makes-right world could also fuel chaos, as is already playing out in Africa, where regional powers have begun to test limits. To gain access to valuable minerals, Rwanda has invaded the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, using its (notoriously abusive) M23 rebels. To continue to profit from Sudan’s gold, the United Arab Emirates has armed the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group despite its genocidal rampages. Might Ethiopia now seize part of Eritrea for the Red Sea port it covets? Might the UAE help Somaliland establish formal independence from Somalia?Beyond Africa, might Israel seize the occasion to annex the occupied Palestinian territory and even to expel Palestinians? Might an unreformed Venezuelan government renew Maduro’s claim to a big chunk of oil-richGuyana? Although Xi Jinping considers international norms against aggression to be irrelevant to Taiwan, which he views as part of China, Trump’s rhetoric might still embolden him to seize the island.Trump’s imperialist order also seems unduly focused on military power. The US economy thrives in significant part through global investments and trade. But that requires respect for the international law that Trump derides. Otherwise, contracts could be broken willy-nilly. Investments can be seized. Business personnel can be held hostage. Already the Trump administration isurgingAmericans to flee Venezuela for fear of kidnapping by armed paramilitaries.Trump would undoubtedly hope to deter such lawlessness, but a lawless defense of law is hard to pull off, and even American power has its limits. The American military has struggled with the capacity to fight major wars on two fronts. It is hardly in a position to become a fire department, putting out conflagrations wherever they pop up. Trump has deftly wielded the threat of tariffs to coerce better treatment of American interests, but even that tactic has its limits as governments in this increasingly multipolar world deprioritize trade with the United States andnegotiatealternative tradedeals.It was telling that as Trump announced his seizure of Venezuela’s oil, the European Union finalized a major free-tradedealwith Mercosur, the South American trade bloc. Similardealsare in the works elsewhere. From tourism to education to business, Americans have profited enormously from the open global order that international law has enabled. Trump’s return to a world of power politics would mean a more circumscribed and impoverished America.Trump has also turned his back on international institutions, preferring my-way-or-the-highway diplomacy. But global threats, from pandemics to the climate crisis, will not be so deferential to the would-be king in Washington, even if he pretends to wish them away. A go-it-alone approach guarantees ineffectiveness.Even US military might cannot be taken for granted. Neutralizing theincompetentVenezuelan military is one thing, but what about China? Trump might figure that the US military can prevail in a short war with Beijing, but the ability to sustain a protracted conflict requires a strong manufacturing base. Yet China’s manufacturing capacity is nowdoublethat of the United States. The United States could try to make up for China’s advantage by joining hands with like-minded democracies, but not if Trump’s unilateralism alienates them.Similarly, China’s current chokehold on rare-earths production requires acoordinatedresponse. But in a might-makes-right world, US allies might believe they are better off cutting their own deals with China, leaving Washington to fend for itself.Because the Pentagon cannot coerce everyone at once, economic clout still matters, but replacing voluntary partnerships with even economic coercion may not be a winning strategy for Washington either. The US economy for now is larger than China’s, but Beijing can direct its state-dominated economy more readily than Washington to promote foreign influence. In many parts of the world, including much ofLatin America, China is already the largest investor and trading partner. Beijing’s belt and road initiative oftenexceededUS development aid even before Trump decimated USAID.For decades, US presidents have seen the national interest served by a global order that limited aggression. Toppling a dictator may seem like a quick win, but if it portends an end to the norms that have helped to protect most international borders andcurtailconflict for decades, it will be a pyrrhic victory.Despite his aspirations, Trump is unlikely to be president for life. In three years, assuming the constitution holds, he will be gone. A lot of damage can be done in the interim, but it need not be irreversible. Beyond waiting for a new president with better judgment, we should do what we can to resist Trump’s flouting of such elemental norms now. Finding every conceivable way to repudiate his lawlessness is essential for redeeming that law in the future.Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch (1993-2022), is a visiting professor at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs.

The 18-year-old appeared onLogan Paul’s Impaulsivepodcast, where she stated that “politics is such a dangerous thing … I think if both sides met in the middle, everyone would be so much more happier.” (Maybe tell that to your grandpa, kid.) “To be honest with you,” she said, “I stay out of politics completely … I don’t want anything to do with politics.”Is Trump building a political dynasty? – episode oneRead moreLook, I know you’re still very young, Kai, so here’s a little advice from an old lady: maybe work just a teeny bit harder at keeping a safe distance from politics. It has not gone unobserved that the influencer and golfer has made alotofcontentabout life behind the scenes at the White House. She’s also launched an apparel collection, which she’s modelled on theWhite House lawn. And, notably, she spoke at the 2024 Republican national convention (RNC), where she insisted Trump was “just a normal grandpa”. I don’t know about that; my grandad didn’t invade Venezuela.Kai, by the way, stressed to Logan Paul that she was the one who decided to speak at the RNC; it was “literally all my idea”. But the nasty media, she noted, spun it otherwise. “[They said] ‘Oh well, that’s like a political plan that was put in place, to like get more voters or anything like that’.” Well, yes, because it was a political convention. They tend to be, you know, political.Still, even though Kai is counting herself out, there’s a good chance we may see another President Trump in our lifetimes. After all, he has five kids and 11 grandchildren. Surely at least one will follow in Donny’s footsteps?The question is: who has the best chance of continuing the political dynasty? At one point I’d have said it was Ivanka. But while I haven’t written off the idea of a political comeback for her, she’s currently sworn off politics and is hanging out in Florida doing billionaire things, while her husband,Jared Kushner, makes plans to redevelop a “cleansed” Gaza.The rest of the Trumps are, sadly, certified losers or too young to opine upon.

By building a protective moat of federalism around itWed 14 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Jan 2026 08.58 ESTShare‘He keeps encouraging me … to choose between Europe and the US. That would be a strategic mistake for our country,” Keir Starmersaid in responseto Ed Davey’s question in the House of Commons last week, about whether a US move against Greenland would mean the end of Nato.What about Europe, though? As Danish and Greenlandic ministers prepared to face JD Vancein the White House, the question was wouldEuropefinally choose between Europe and the US? Will its leaders have the courage to tell the full truth – that the US isn’t simplyabandoning its alliesanddestroying the international orderbut is now in the position of active and hostile predation by force – and more importantly, to act on it? To offer Denmark moral and material backing, and Greenland a future of self-determination and membership, rather than subservience to US resource plunder?Donald Trump has already set the tone by saying the US will seize Greenland “one way or the other”, and no part of the triumvirate around him is trying to hide their imperial intentions any more. Not the nepotists and grifters amassing ever greater private fortunes. Not the white supremacist ideologues drawing inspiration fromEin Volk, Ein Reich, Ein Führer!to post “One Homeland. One People. One Heritage”, via official US government social media accounts. Not the techno-nihilists salivating to mine every bit of Greenland’s mineral resources and rule their ownneofeudal city stateson its coast.WhenTrump saysthat the only constraint on his exercise of power is “my own morality”, that meansthere is no constraint. Like Vladimir Putin, he will keep grabbing until someone imposes a limit on him.The truth is, Maga’s grand design for a new American empire has never been all that hidden. During the final months of the 2024 US presidential election, unfamiliar maps started going viral in the Magasphere. These maps are all in some way derivative of a1930s movementthat sought to create what it called the Technate of America, a union of most of North America and some of South America under US power and control. The “technate” would run south from Greenland, through Canada, Mexico, Cuba and Venezuela, stretching all the way to French Guiana (afull French departmentstanding in the way of the “Donroe doctrine”).So what can Europe do, as this mad historic fantasy comes closer to reality? How do you maintain a space of democracy and the rule of law in a world that is rapidly reverting to imperialism, oligarchy and the rule of power alone? Only by building a protective moat of federalism around it.If the US actually attacks Denmark by invading Greenland, and declares war on the EU, atreaty-bound defensive alliance, the hand of history will be forced. Europe would need to both expand and restructure to become a defence and intelligence union that absorbs Nato’s non-EU members. Such a situation would demand the seizure of US military bases from Germany to Spain, individual sanctions on a wide range of US government officials, broad sanctions against the US economy, and an unapologetic expansion of the “carbon border tax” across every sector. There would surely be pressure not to stop there, but to use the EU’sAnti-Coercion Instrumentto ban X and other large US tech companies and accelerate the replacement of US-controlledpayments infrastructurewith European systems and a digital euro.And if the US doesn’t attack Denmark, Europe’s best chance of surviving as a free and open continent in an imperial world is still to force the rupture with the US, force the consequences, and force the federalismanyway.Whatever comes out of the meeting in the White House today, it is time for Europe to tell the US to leave its European military bases, throw off the yoke of US tech billionaires, begin a concerted push to fund public media as a form of informational defence – and maybe even expand the Erasmus programme into a general purpose European civil service corps. Everything short of actual combat should be considered, because “annexing Greenland” is a symptom of American fascism, and others will follow.A generous interpretation of how Europe’s political leaders have spent the past year is that they have been playing for time to prepare. A more critical reading is that they naively tried to avoid the costs of a rupture with Trump and now their time is up, and there is no option that is cost free. We can either choose the crisis and the cost of that historic break, or be subjected to the crises and costs that the US will choose for us. But our window to choose is narrowing. Trump, Vance, Steve Bannon and others are explicit that they will boost far right, anti-EU parties into power wherever possible, with the goal (shared with Putin) of detonating the EU from within.By boldly detaching from the US now, visibly and decisively, Europe might even send a resuscitative shock through the US’s ailing democratic corpus. Only Americans can save their country from a descent into something even uglier and deadlier than what we are witnessing already. But for everyone’s sake, theirs included, Europe must cut the cord now, and not follow them into the storm.Alexander Hurst writes for Guardian Europe from Paris.

It is not enough that they remove harm when they find it – the law must make their systems prevent harmWed 14 Jan 2026 11.48 ESTShareOn X, a woman posts a photo in a sari, and within minutes, various users are underneath the post tagging Grok to strip her down to a bikini. It is a shocking violation of privacy, but now afamiliar and commonplace practice. Between June 2025 and January 2026, I documented 565 instances of users requesting Grok to create nonconsensual intimate imagery. Of these, 389 were requested in just one day.Last Friday, after a backlash against the platform’s ability to create such nonconsensual sexual images, X announced that Grok’s AI image generation feature wouldonly be available to subscribers.Reports suggest that the botnow no longer respondsto prompts to generate images of women in bikinis (although apparently will still do so for requests about men).But as the technology secretary, Liz Kendall, rightly states, this action “does not go anywhere near far enough”. Kendall has announced that creating nonconsensual intimate images willbecome a criminal offencethis week, and that she will criminalise the supply of nudification apps. This is appropriate, given X’s weak response. Placing the feature behind a paywall means that the platform can more directly profit off the online dehumanisation and sexual harassment of women and minors. And stopping the “bikini” responses after public censure and the threat of legislation is the least X can do – the bigger question is why it was even possible in the first place.These measures are a step forward. The shadow technology secretary, Julia Lopez, suggested in her response that the government was overreacting, that this was just “a modern-day iteration of an old problem”, no different from crude drawings or Photoshop. She’s wrong. The scale is different. The accessibility is different. The speed is different. With Photoshop, there is a technical skill required, as well as direct publication by a user, which places all actions except platform provision squarely on them. In this case, though, the user makes a regular text reply with a request, and Grok generates and publishes criminal abuse to a massive audience.Grok is undressing women and children. Don’t expect the US to take action | Moira DoneganRead moreKendall’s approach criminalises users who create or alter these images, and the companies that supply dedicated nudification tools. That’s where it misses the point. Grok and most prominent image-generation tools are not dedicated nudification tools. They are general-purpose AI with weak safeguards. Kendall is not asking platforms to implement proactive detection. The law waits for harm to happen, then punishes.The drawbacks of this approach are obvious. I observed this material being generated for months before the mainstream backlash began. These are harmful images that were generated that still exist, and perhaps were saved and shared across other platforms. For the victims of this AI sexual abuse material, regulation after the fact won’t help. For harm that is structurally amplified in this manner, the approach must be preventive, not reactionary.Another more fundamental problem is that while the UK pushes AI safety regulation, the US is moving in the opposite direction. TheTrump administrationwants to “enhance the United States’ global AI dominance through a minimally burdensome national policy framework for AI”. Under this framework, there is little incentive for American AI companies to regulate misuse of their products. This matters because AI regulation is incomplete without cross-border collaboration. Kendall can criminalise users in the UK, she can threaten to ban X entirely. But she cannot stop Grok from being programmed in San Francisco. She cannot force OpenAI or Anthropic or any other US company to prioritise safety over speed. Without US cooperation, we are trying to regulate a transnational technology with national laws.While this wrangling over regulation and updating policy plays out, many victims, and other women online, will be wondering what this new era of AI-enabled online sexual harassment means for them, and questioning their participation on global social media platforms. If my image has been digitally altered, how do I get justice if the perpetrator is halfway across the world? Transparency in the practices of AI companies isin decline– so how could the same companies be trusted to be accountable and audit systems that reproduce harm?The truth is that these companies cannot be trusted. This is why globally, regulation needs to shift from “remove harm when you find it” to “prove that your system prevents harm”. We must code power into the process by requiring mandatory input filtering, independent audits and licensing conditions that make prevention a legal technical requirement. This means it may catch the harm before it materialises, enabling regulation to minimise harmful behaviour by these AI companies before their products are deployed. This is the type of work that we at theAI Accountability Labin theAdapt Centreat Trinity College Dublin are pushing forward through our research.Regulation after the fact is better than nothing. However, it offers little to the victims who have already been harmed, and sidesteps the conspicuous absence of law enforcement in addressing these platform harms.Nana Nwachukwu is an AI governance expert and a PhD researcher at Trinity College DublinExplore more on these topicsGrok AIOpinionAI (artificial intelligence)XLabourLiz KendallInternetComputingcommentShareReuse this content"

He’s now ordered the justice department toopen an investigationinto the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, all the while appearing tofall asleep during meetings.What a year, huh?Unsurprisingly this has led to a fair degree of investor skittishness. Uncertainty is the watchword, given the biggest economy in the world is being run by a somnolent autocrat who is the pettiest grudge holder in world history.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAs a result, despite the level of economic policy uncertainty in the US falling since the madness of last year’s tariff announcements, it remains three times higher than when Trump won the election in November 2024. Essentially, investors and anyone trying to work out what could happen to US policy might as well consult a magic 8-ball:If the graph does not display click hereWhen things get uncertain, investors look for safety, and gold is generally regarded as the safest bet. Earlier this week the price ofgold surpassed US$4,600 an ouncefor the first time. That is about 73% higher than it was when Trump took office 14 months ago:If the graph does not display click hereThat price increase is faster than during the pandemic when the global economy shut down, faster than during the GFC when the US banking sector collapsed, and faster than after September 11. The only time the price of gold has risen quicker than during Trump’s first 14 months in power is during the 1973 Opec crisis and the 1979 oil crisis after the Iranian revolution:If the graph does not display click hereSomewhat ironically, this uncertainty has indirectly benefited the Australian government.Australia is the third biggest producerof gold in the world. And, when gold prices rise, so too does value of Australia’s gold exports:If the graph does not display click hereSo great has been the increase in the gold price that it is close to becoming Australia’s second biggest export – likely to overtake LNG and coal:If the graph does not display click hereThat means gold companies in Australia are paying much more corporate tax than expected.Surprise dip in inflation a lightbulb moment – but RBA unlikely to deliver interest rate bargains | Greg JerichoRead moreThis was noted in last month’s mid-year economic and fiscal outlook.The Myefoincreased corporate tax revenue by $4.3bn in 2025–26. A big reason was “a near-term increase in mining profits reflecting higher bulk commodity and gold prices”.So indirectly the government is better off through higher taxes, but directly as well because the Reserve Bank holds a lot of gold – about 80 tonnes of it. As a result, the value of its gold reserve assets has risen from $9.6bn in December 2024 to $15.7bn last month – a nice 64% increase. It makes the value of the RBA’s gold assets higher now than ever before.If the graph does not display click hereBut it could have been more – a lot more.In 1997, the RBA, with then treasurer Peter Costello’s full support,sold two-thirds of its gold reserves– 167 tonnes of the 250 tonnes it held. The RBA argued that gold wasn’t really increasing in value much and a lot of other central banks were selling their gold, because the old gold standard was dead.Costello was quite proud of this move,noting in an answer to parliamentthat “the reinvested proceeds should yield higher annual profits for the Reserve Bank than if they have been retained as gold”.And for a while that would have been the case.During the mining boom, as the value of other investments soared, it seemed that selling the gold was a smart idea. But once those gains were wiped away during the GFC it was clear any advantage gained from selling the gold was more to do with good luck than good management:If the graph does not display click hereThe value of 167 tonnes of gold in December was worth around A$33bn, much more than the roughly $2.5bn from the sale of the 167 tonnes of gold back in 1997. If they invested it on average across all the non-gold assets the RBA holds, that would now be worth $9.6bn.That means the 1997 gold sale has left the RBA’s assets about $23.4bn worse off. Not the greatest decision ever made.Now sure, neither Costello nor the RBA could have predicted Trump. But gold has always been about the safe long-term investment. And in a world going to hell, I suspect the RBA, like other investors, would like to have a bit more safety.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and chief economist at the Australia InstituteExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyOpinionGoldTrump tariffscommentShareReuse this content"

Today marks a big step towards that goalOffshore windfarm contracts to fuel 12m homes in Great Britain after record auctionWed 14 Jan 2026 04.30 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Jan 2026 11.48 ESTShareIn the 18 months since I became energy secretary, the government has made a simple argument: that if we want to bring down energy bills for good, Britain needs to get off the rollercoaster of fossil fuels and instead build up clean homegrown power that we control.We know that bills rocketed when Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine because in the international fossil fuel markets, Britain is a price-taker, not a price-maker. Renewables and nuclear, on the other hand, offer a chance for Britain to stand on our own two feet in the world – making and setting the price of our own energy.Over the last year and a half, a well-funded rightwing network has waged a relentless war against this argument. When Keir Starmer set out our mission for clean power by 2030, it said it couldn’t be done, or that even if it could it was the wrong choice.Today’s historicoffshore wind auctionhas proved the doubters wrong. The government has secured a record-breaking 8.4GW of offshore wind, enough to power the equivalent of more than 12m homes, the largest amount of offshore wind procured in any auction ever in Britain, or indeed Europe. Especially considering the difficult global context in which the industry finds itself, this is a hugely significant milestone for offshore wind in Britain and around the world.The billions of pounds of private investment that this historic auction unlocks will provide the foundation for a new era of energy sovereignty and abundance for our country. It ensures that the next generation of Britons will grow up in a country that controls its own energy destiny, and produces enough to meet our roaring demand for new homes, new towns and new industry.A lot of nonsense is said about the cost of renewables. The key fact in our auction is this: the average price we have secured for fixed offshore wind projects is £90.91 per megawatt-hour – significantly cheaper than the cost of building and operating a new gas plant.The unavoidable issue we face is that for years there hasn’t been enough investment in Britain’s energy system, while at the same time power demand is expected tomore than doubleby 2050. Those who want us to stop building renewables need to reckon with the fact that there is no alternative to building new energy infrastructure in Britain. And it is clear offshore wind remains significantly cheaper to build and operate than new gas.Today’s auction includes fixed offshore projects in every part of Great Britain: Dogger Bank South off the coast of Yorkshire and Norfolk Vanguard off East Anglia, two of the largest offshore windfarms in the world; Berwick Bank in the North Sea, the first new Scottish project since 2022; and Awel Y Môr, the first Welsh project to win a contract in more than a decade.We’ve also secured pioneering floating offshore wind projects in Scotland and Wales, putting Britain in pole position to lead in the emerging technologies of the future.This points to an industry roaring back under this government after thefiasco of 2023’s auctionunder the Tories, which failed to deliver a single offshore wind project. These results put us firmly on track to deliver the clean power system we need for 2030 and beyond.And as we take these long-term decisions, we are cutting bills in the short term too – taking an average of £150 of costs off annual energy bills from April and expanding the warm home discount to give six million of the poorest families an additional £150 off their bills.This record result also represents a major step forward for our industrial strategy, as we seize the opportunities of clean energy to meet the demand of the British people for the good jobs of the future. These projects will create thousands of jobs for engineers, technicians and factory workers and unlock £22bn of investment in Britain, as we advance towards the 100,000 offshore wind jobs our mission will support by the end of the decade.These results form part of a central new dividing line in British politics. Reform UK and the Conservatives want to wage war on clean energy, leaving Britain strapped to the fossil fuel rollercoaster, destroying the clean energy jobs we are creating and betraying our young people and future generations by giving up on tackling the climate crisis.Labour is brave enough to face down the naysayers because clean power is the right choice for lower bills, energy security, good jobs and the climate.

This is markedly different to when our first baby was born two years ago, after which I was able to take only three weeks of paternity leave – while my partner chose to take the full period of maternity leave and not to return to work.Three in five dads in the UKtake some paternity leave, but the primary reason why leave is not taken or is kept as minimal as possible isfinancial, with many unable to afford the luxury of spending time with their newborns.Shared parental leave– usually the only way to take more than a couple of weeks – is a headache to understand let alone apply for, and usually relies on the mother giving up part of her own leave. We looked into it with our first child, but it would have left us worse off financially, so we opted not to pursue it.The period leading up to a child’s birth can feel like a whirlwind of emotions – joy and happiness mixed with worry and concern – but the main thing I remember the first time around is feeling overwhelmed. This was made even worse by looming deadlines and a mounting workload before I took time off. Working from home blurred boundaries even more, with me working into the early hours of the morning trying to meet my deadlines and not fall behind.The due date loomed over the other deadlines and tasks on the to-do list like a big red countdown rather than the special day when our baby would be born. An extended hospital stay for my wife meant I was spending time working by the hospital bed, tallying up time off in lieu to be able to have more time once my wife and child were at home.For our second child, my wife opted for a caesarean section, a decision informed by the fact that I would not be expected to get back to work but would be fully present, supporting her recovery and our kids. Thinking back to those first few weeks, amid the sleep-deprivation delirium were the small things that aided recovery, which might not be possible if your partner was not there. As well as the usual changing of nappies and feeds, it gave breathing space for important steps such as remembering when to give medication and focusing on mobility exercises, rather than rushing into tasks that risk infections and rehospitalisation.Our first child used to go to “stay and play” – playgroups for babies and toddlers often hosted at libraries or churches – with his mum every day. The one time I took him, he point-blank refused to play for a while, as if unsure or apprehensive about my presence there. It felt like one of those small jabs your child gives you when you wrestle them into pyjamas, but delivered to the heart. But I’m now regularly re-enacting the storylines from Gecko’s Garage with him and his toy trucks and I’m able to assist him in some of the many repairs he carries out every day. Being able to be present every day means my wife and I can tackle challenges together, rather than being told of another biting incident at the nursery after work. I now keep myself updated on the weather, scouring for dry days to make a trip to the zoo, rather than working on public policy and legislative proposals.It has been heartening to see momentum for better paternity leave in both the government’s review of paternity leave and day-one rights for parents delivered in Labour’semployment rights reforms. Yet these measures still leave much to be desired. For parents in low-income, insecure jobs, worries about financial security may mean they don’t even take the minimum statutory leave given they’d lose 10% of their pay over the two weeks. This is where government protections are most needed; ensuring well-paid, extended and enhanced parental leave allows parents to better focus on caring for their newborn. Campaigns such as The Dad Shift have highlighted theinadequacy of current paternity leave, particularly for births involving C-sections.After bedtime, when my wife and I steal some time for ourselves to doomscroll through TikTok and Reels, I’ve been served content that suggests mums who are asking for more support with raising kids are weak; and men who are overly involved in childcare are denigrating their role as the head of the household. This content seems to emanatefrom the manosphere, where content is ever-morphing to prey on people during those periods of their lives when they are more likely to fall for these harmful ideas. But it’s not just from male creators – some of those messages are also coming from“tradwife” influencers. When juggling work, children and all the economic difficulties of today, it can be seductive for young men to blame the demands of parenthood on shifting societal roles – an easier target than the real economic and social conditions we find ourselves in today.Thinking back to those questions I got before my parental leave started, I now say that being at work is less tiring than parenting all day. But being exhausted from parenting is many times more fulfilling than being exhausted from a work deadline. Catching as many “firsts” for your child as possible with your own eyes can never be boring.

That’s not what voters wantRafael BehrAn economic recovery could still change the parties’ fortunes. But the days when only two parties were licensed to supply Britain with prime ministers are goneWed 14 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Jan 2026 07.49 ESTShareUnpopular politicians take consolation in the thought that opinion polls are sometimes wrong and often describe the wrong thing. They capture the moment but don’t predict the future. A midterm poll measures how much voters like the government. A general election asks whether the opposition is trusted to take over. It isn’t the same question.Labour’s hopes for recovery rest on that distinction. The plan is that economic growth and governing competence will boost general wellbeing in the coming years. That will dial up the risks associated with other parties, especially forReform UK. Voters who lack enthusiasm for the prime minister may be persuaded to stick with him if the alternative is Nigel Farage.A similar calculation sustains theConservatives, although in their version, the economy falters. The Tories then hope to surge with a campaign arguing that Labour has overtaxed Britain and misspent the proceeds, and that Reform UK, lacking fiscal or any other discipline, would make matters worse.These are optimistic but not wildly improbable scenarios. They also have a common bias in the assumption that politics will follow precedent; that beneath the surface volatility flow strong and familiar currents; that the normal way of things is not lost for ever.ForLabour, that assumes continuity of a trend for the ruling parties to regain support when a general election comes around. For the Tories, it is the idea that Britain always turns to them as the accountants of last resort, once Labour has run out of money.Both are attached to the convention that only two parties are licensed to supply Britain with prime ministers and, whatever polls might show today, Reform UK is not one of them.Farage recognises that as a cultural barrier to his ambition. It is why he takes such pleasure in parading Conservative converts to his cause. Their function is to cast Reform UK as the new natural party of power on the right. The downside risk is diluting any claim to rupture from the old establishment.The latest recruit, Nadhim Zahawi, illustrates the dilemma. On one hand, having a former Tory chancellor on board is supposed to signal the seriousness of intent to govern. On the other hand, Zahawi is an opportunist who resigned over tax irregularities and is on record callingFarage a menace to Britain. The Reform leader is betting that he gains more in political momentum from headline-grabbing defections than he loses in brand contamination when the calibre of the defector comes under scrutiny. Sharing stages with every kind of opportunist chancer has never slowed Farage’s progress before.Meanwhile, Kemi Badenoch’s boosters claim her recent focus on the economy is working. The Toriesare polling marginally highernow than a few months ago, but are still shy of the 24%share they managedin July 2024, when they were crushed in a general election. It could be worse. Keir Starmeris struggling to keepLabour’s share out of the high teens and above the Greens.Strategists in all parties like to complain about Westminster’s unhealthy obsession with polling (while obsessing unhealthily over polls). It is true that surveys don’t tell us anything certain about a general election that isn’t due before 2029. The future is never fixed. Also, Britain’s first-past-the-post electoral system ishopelessly ill-equippedto translate multiparty politics into a rational distribution of parliamentary seats. Once four or five candidates are clustered around the same projected vote share, almost anything could happen.Two-party politics assumes stable bases of support on the left and on the right, with swing voters migrating across the centre ground. In today’s fragmented and polarised climate, that trade is thinner than traffic within multiparty blocs: a liberal-progressive one and a conservative-nationalist one. Neither is very stable, but they are efficiently delineated by attitudes to Farage. Either you recoil from the thought of him holding the levers of national power, or you don’t.Labour and Tory leaders assume a historic claim to primacy within their respective coalitions, but that sense of entitlement doesn’t reflect the balance of real-world opinion. Viewed through the lens of local council races so far this parliament, England’s two-party systemlooks more like a competitionbetween Reform and the Liberal Democrats.Perhaps it is premature to call the decline of Labour-Tory duopoly terminal. Farage might have peaked. He might be consumed by scandal. Starmer and Kemi Badenoch might be replaced by leaders who give their respective parties new leases of life.But the possibility that a more permanent, seismic change is under way might also be underpriced by Labour and Tory leaders who have a lot invested in old patterns reasserting themselves. The scale of it is hard to process, psychologically and psephologically. It requires acceptance that their current unpopularity is not just a consequence of dissatisfaction with choices made by the present government and its immediate predecessor, but an expression of doubt that politics in the familiar configuration can deliver anything other than disappointment.The historic Labour -Tory rivalry is also a kind of mutual dependency. They define themselves as ideological antitheses and so they find it hard to admit shared ownership, in many voters’ minds, of a long historical incumbency. They are joint guardians of the Westminster system that has stopped working for a lot of people since around the time of the 2007-08 financial crisis. That was when average incomes stopped rising in real terms, when conveyors of opportunity stalled and the postwar promise that each generation could have what their parents had and more was broken.It is unfair to apportion blame equally to both parties when every prime minister from 2010 to 2024 was a Tory. Labour didn’t preside over austerity and Brexit. But it was Starmer’s job, as the first Labour leader to win an election since 2005, to convince people that he had a theory of what had gone wrong in the meantime, and a plan to fix it. Hisfailure to communicatesuch things is one point on which opinion polls are unambiguous.Could he turn Labour’s fortunes around? Could Badenoch capitalise on his weakness to put the Tories back in contention? Normal political patterns indicate either is possible. But the pattern of recent politics also suggests that the old normal is exactly what voters do not want.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionLabourKeir StarmerConservativesReform UKGeneral electionscommentShareReuse this content"

How do we say ‘enough’ in this world of abundance?Jodi WilsonWhen you subtract what’s superfluous, you’re left with the essentials – the things that really matter to youTue 13 Jan 2026 23.52 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Jan 2026 02.43 ESTShareTen years ago, a postie delivered eight packages to my door. Each one contained something for me to photograph and promote on social media, and the pile felt ominous. Too much stuff, too much obligation! I was disgusted by the excess.A few years later, my partner and I sold 80% of our belongings, and moved into a caravan to go on a road-trip around the country with our four children. I think this is called overhauling your life; when you subtract what’s superfluous so you’re left with the essentials – the things that really matter. Another word for it is “enoughness”: take what you need, leave the rest – a counter-cultural concept in 2026.After a shift to van life and two slow years on the road, we eventually settled in a small town in rural Lutruwita/Tasmania. We bought a house, got a dog and enrolled the kids in school. People were interested in our choices, they were curious about one particular thing: how had I held on to the lessons I’d learned? What they were really asking was, how have I prevented my life from filling back up again?Simplicity is intriguing because it’s a radical choice in a world that promotes more. From a neurological perspective it’s innately difficult because it goes against our primal instincts; we have a scarcity mindset so our brain thinks, “I better get this now because it might not be there later.” How does it play out in a modern world of abundance? We’re gorging on food, stuff and the infinite scroll of information and entertainment – our brain is full, which makes us feel overwhelmed and exhausted.We all know this feeling: too many mental tabs open, too many obligations and to-dos, the pressure to keep going and keep up in a world that makes us question whether we’re good enough, whether we’re doing enough. How do we even start living more simply, more sufficiently, when there’s so much to strip away?I’m not saying to take a red pen to your life and cut out the crap but, considering most of us have decision fatigue, using enoughness as a lens for our decision-making can be helpful. It prompts small but significant changes; how much you buy, what you buy, how much time you spend chasing what you don’t have and pining for what may never be yours.There is a ghastly amount of stuff that already exists in the world and the donation pile at the op-shop in January is a pertinent reminder. I know I’ll contribute to it this year – like I do every year – and I’ll walk away defeated and disappointed. I know I can use this to steer my decisions. But I also have to be practical: when we buy something new (or new to us), we experience a dopamine-hit that makes us feel good, even if it’s fleeting. The ease of this transaction momentarily pulls us away from our niggling doubts and fears. It’s a distraction from everything that feels too hard – and when uncertainty is rife, it’s more pleasurable to indulge in what is predictable and comforting. We are human, and this is our nature.There’s nothing bad about chasing a hedonistic life, but rarely do we consider the burden of what we own, the obligations we have, the need to work to pay for what we want. The root word of “thrift” is “thrive” and it’s true that there is a quiet, reverberating, even joyous energy when we mend what’s broken, use what we’ve got, grow something from seed and borrow what we can. As writer and psychologistAndrew Solomonsays: “The opposite of depression is not happiness, it’s vitality.”I know that living simply is easy in a caravan where you only carry what is purposeful. In a three-bedroom house, there is much more leeway and so my life often feels like it’s defined by odd socks, overflowing washing baskets and precariously stacked dirty dishes. And yet, my children are bowerbirds and we exist alongside their miscellaneous accoutrements; small piles of ephemera decorating surfaces. I know these things are not liabilities, as the work of life is also the proof of life.But still, I want to normalise the simple things that help me practically apply “enoughness” in my everyday life: outfit repeating, buying pre-loved, using up all the food in the fridge, weekly library visits, planting and tending a garden, rest.When you subtract what you can, you create breathing space – and we all need more of that.Jodi Wilson is a health journalist and author.

Membership was made a criminal offence. Members could also be deported if they were not British subjects born in Australia.One hundred and three members were imprisoned, and others were deported. Some were put on a ship and dumped in Chile, even though they had no connection with Chile.Neo-Nazi group claims it will disband before Labor’s hate speech legislation is brought to parliamentRead moreWhile the validity of the legislation was not challenged, it probably would not have survived constitutional scrutiny.In 1940, the Menzies government used defence regulations to ban “subversive associations”, including the Communist party in Australia. The governor general was empowered to declare a body unlawful if it was “in his opinion, prejudicial to the defence of the commonwealth or the efficient prosecution of the war”.Once that declaration was made, the body was dissolved and its property could be confiscated. It then became unlawful to publish any doctrines or principles advocated by that body.The ban on the Communist party was lifted in 1942 after the Soviet Union joined the war on the side of the allies. But another banned body – the Adelaide Company of Jehovah’s Witnesses – challenged the regulations in the high court and won.Justice Starke described the regulations as “arbitrary, capricious and oppressive” because they put bodies “out of existence and divested [them] of their rights and their property on the mere declaration of the executive government”.In 1950, the Menzies government had another go, this time enacting the Communist Party Dissolution Act.It declared the Australian Communist party to be an unlawful association and dissolved it, seizing its property.The governor general, acting on ministerial advice, could also declare similar organisations to be unlawful and declare persons to be communists and “likely to engage in acts prejudicial to the security of the commonwealth or the execution of its laws”. If a person was declared a communist, he or she could not be employed as a commonwealth public servant or hold any office in a trade union.The high court struck down the validity of the act; it was not supported by the defence power. Merely stating in the preamble to the act that communists were a threat to the defence of the nation was not enough to trigger the application of the defence power. Nor could the governor general’s assessment of a body do so either.Justice Dixon also raised concerns about the impact of the act on civil liberties. He thought that “only the supreme emergency of war itself” could extend the defence power in such a way that it affected “the status, property and civil rights” of people who were named or otherwise identifiable under the Act. Not even Australia’s participation in the Korean war was enough to support such a ban.We are now returning to banning organisations, even though Australia is not at war. The purpose is to “protect the Australian community against social, economic, psychological and physical harm” by prohibiting organisations that engage in or advocate conduct constituting a hate crime. This extends to conduct that was not a crime when committed.Under the proposed laws, no one needs to have been convicted of a hate crime for the minister to be satisfied that an organisation has engaged in conduct constituting a hate crime and there is no requirement for the minister to observe procedural fairness. The governor general declares a group to be a prohibited hate group by making a regulation, upon the minister’s advice.This time there is no reliance on the defence power; instead, the bill relies on treaty obligations directed at racial hatred.Whether the high court would today take as robust a view as it has in the past to laws banning organisations and whether it would uphold its validity remains to be seen. But history suggests that such laws have been neither wise nor necessary, and that one should think very carefully before putting in place laws which have the potential to be abused in the future.Anne Twomey is a Professor emerita in constitutional law at the University of SydneyExplore more on these topicsAustralian lawOpinionProtestRaceAustralian security and counter-terrorismAustralian politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Yet he says he is not a masochist. We meet the man Marina Abramovich calls ‘the master’Sinéad GleesonWed 14 Jan 2026 11.37 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Jan 2026 12.14 ESTShareFor one year, beginning on 30 September 1978, Tehching Hsieh lived in an 11ft 6in x 9ft wooden cage. He was not permitted to speak, read or consume any media, but every day a friend visited with food and to remove his waste.The vital context here is that this incarceration was voluntary: Hsieh is a Taiwanese-American artist whose chosen practice is performance art, undertaking durational “actions” for long periods. Marina Abramović has called him the “master” of the form. In 1980, seven months after the end of Cage Piece, Hsieh began another year-long work, Time Clock Piece, which required him to punch a factory-style clock-in machine in his studio, every hour of each day for 365 days.Life can be tough. You have to be your own character. I was very stubborn and had to surviveWhenever I tell people about his work, the response is either admiration or incredulity. Why would anyone want to subject themselves to this kind of discipline and repetition over such a long period of time? “The kind of art I make is about how I understand the world,” says Hsieh. “It’s how I mark the passing of time. That’s all life is, and it’s the one thing that makes us all equal. It doesn’t matter if you’re lazy or hard-working, poor or rich, we’re all just passing time.” Hsieh is sitting in Dia Beacon – the museum for the DiaArtFoundation – in upstate New York, where a major retrospective, Lifeworks: 1978-1999, is three days from opening.View image in fullscreen‘I realised I could use my body to express things’ … sleeping rough for Outdoor Piece.Photograph: Tehching Hsieh, courtesy Dia Art Foundation/© Tehching HsiehBorn in 1950 as one of 15 children in Nanzhou, Taiwan, Hsieh never finished school. During compulsory military service in the early 1970s, he began painting, but became interested in performance work. Jump, his first action, was performed in 1973 and involved him leaping from a second storey window (he broke both his ankles). Taiwan was a conservative society and the US beckoned as the place to continue his practice. In 1974, after taking a cleaning job on an oil tanker, Hsieh jumped ship in Philadelphia and made his way to New York.As an undocumented migrant with no English, he took cleaning jobs and worked in kitchens. He was an outsider on multiple fronts, but doesn’t feel this influenced his drift towards performance art. “Literature and philosophy influenced me – Kafka, Dostoevsky, existentialism … but then I had no passport or social security number in America. So I couldn’t apply for grants and had to use my own money. Even when it was difficult, I still made the work. I used to think I had to go out and find ideas, but I realised that I could use my body to express things, even though I don’t think my work is autobiographical.”View image in fullscreen‘I cannot go inside!’ … objecting to his arrest for vagrancy during Outdoor Piece.Photograph: Claire Fergusson, courtesy Dia Art Foundation/© Tehching HsiehPainting would have been an easier path, but Hsieh became interested in conceptual art and pivoted. He began to plan actions for which he would create a concept, outline the project with a statement of rules, and commit to it. His first five works took place over one year; the year-long framework reflects the idea of the circle, a life lived in one year increments around the sun. The word “durational” has been widely used to describe this kind of long-form art, but Hsieh is slightly resistant to the term. “When people use the word ‘durational’ about what I do, I point out that six minutes is also a duration. I was just interested in the idea that one year is a human calculation we all recognise.”Arguably his most difficult project, One-Year Performance 1981-1982, involved living outside for the whole year. He was not permitted to enter any building, vehicle, or use a tent. On the day a friend happened to be filming, he was arrested for vagrancy and in the footage with NYPD, is shown struggling, shouting: “I cannot go inside!” That winter was the coldest of the century in New York. At Dia, a video of collated clips shows the brutality of it: washing in the Hudson, sleeping in car parks, or carrying his backpack through heavy snow. One gallery wall is lined with printouts of downtown Manhattan, documenting the routes he took, the fluctuating temperatures, the sites of defecation.In person, Hsieh is compact and neatly dressed. He is almost pathologically modest, playing down the hardship and commitment of those one-year projects. He is self-deprecating about the impact and groundbreaking nature of the work and ambivalent about art world praise. “This was the way for me to make art. I enjoyed the freedom – and freedom of thought – it brought. I had no desire to be rich or successful. I don’t feel I needed it. So I was never in competition with anybody.”Occasionally Hsieh takes out his phone to look up something on Google translate. When talking about the difficulty of the performances, he searches for a word that he never wanted to be described as. The screen says: “martyr”.The mainstream New York art world of the time was by and large run by white men. Anyone different, including those making corporeal performance art like Abramović, Carolee Schneemann, and Hsieh – often found themselves outside that. Hsieh learned to rely on himself, to be his own curator, with the cage and street as his gallery. He cites Kafka’s The Castle, in which a man struggles to gain access to a certain world. “Life is not equal for everyone and it can be tough, but you have to be your own character. I was very stubborn and had to survive.”View image in fullscreenCounting the days … in Cage Piece.Photograph: Claire Fergusson, Life Images; courtesy Dia Art Foundation/© Tehching HsiehDespite his outsider status at the beginning of his career, Hsieh doesn’t feel the actions he created were political. The pieces emerged from a personal perspective, he says, even if others detected topical undercurrents. Outdoor Piece explored themes of homelessness, carcerality, navigating a city without transport or the comfort of a home to return to. “People often tell me what they think the work is about, or what they feel are my themes or ideas. It was never about politics – it was always about just passing time.”I ask if Outdoor Piece was his hardest work to undertake and he is typically droll. “It’s like being asked about a favourite child, ‘Which one do I like more?’ The six pieces in the show are like my children so I can’t say that one was harder than the other. But the work is not masochistic, it’s not about pain, even if other people think that it is.” He likens some performance art to the equivalent of lying on one nail, but thinks of his own as more even, like a bed of nails.Hsieh’s work can also be seen as a prophecy of the non-stop nature of life, how it is almost impossible to disappear, or to not be seen or traced by technology. It speaks to the hyper connectivity of modern life and the digital world, and of our constant proximity to others. In 1983, for his fourth one-year project, he was tied by an eight-foot rope to fellow artist Linda Montano.View image in fullscreen‘I was never in competition with anybody’ … Hsieh todayPhotograph: Mollie McKinleyAt the core of early performance art is its impermanence and ephemerality, but Hsieh was fastidious in documenting what he made. There were daily photographs of Cage Pieceand tapes of recorded conversations with Montana as they were tied together. One vitrine at Dia Beacon houses a pile of the time-clock chads and 8,760 photographs of Hsieh – one for each hourly punch – span the walls. In the reconstructed wooden cage, the original toothpaste and brush sit on a sink. Seeing his life’s work in one place is stark and moving.Hsieh concluded his final 13-year performance (Thirteen Year Plan) – of making art and not showing it publicly – in Greenwich Village on New Year’s Eve 1999, the day he turned 49. He released a statement that resembled a ransom collage (and is on display in Dia) that states: “I kept myself alive. I passed the Dec 31, 1999.”He is frequently asked why he stopped his artistic practice, or if he has made any art in the interim. He makes a differentiation. “I never finished or retired, I just don’t do it any more. I only ever wanted to do what I wanted to do … and I did that. I’ve been in New York for over 50 years and I’m very comfortable living here, but I still don’t call it home. I think of it more as a community, but if people enjoy the work I made here, and I die here, I accept that.”Tehching Hsieh: Lifeworks 1978-1999 is at Dia Beacon, New YorkExplore more on these topicsArt and designPerformance artArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A compilation of photographs taken by the artist between 1973 and 1986, the Ballad has been presented as an ever-changing slide show, with various accompanying soundtracks and voiceovers, since the 1980s.It has also been presented on video, as a film and a book. I’ve been familiar with these images for much of my adult life, watching Robin smoking, with Kenny in the background in the purple room. The smoke still hangs there beneath the mirrorball and Robin’s profile is still astonishing. I have seen Suzanne in tears and, in another shot, looking at her face in the mirror in a tiled bathroom dizzy with slanting reflections.A year later, Brian ended up beating her very badly, consumed by jealousyI have seen these picnics and beach days and the road in the hot light and the man sitting on the edge of the bed, lost in his thoughts. Goldin observes him as she squeezes the shutter (you can’t see this, but you know it is happening). The camera is on a tripod on the far side of the room, and Nan and Brian had been photographing themselves having sex, just as she’d taken pictures of her other friends doing the same. There’s some twitchy sullen feeling in the air you can’t identify. A year later, Brian ended up beating her very badly, consumed by jealousy after reading her diary.View image in fullscreenLike a beautiful corpse … French Chris on the convertible, New York City (1979).Photograph: Nan Goldin/GagosianGoldin has called the Ballad the diary she lets people read. Her Nikon camera was always to hand, so much so that people forgot about it (except when they didn’t). In this show, Goldin displays it in the form of 126 framed photographic prints, stacked four high and covering three black walls. They fill the space. The slide show originally presented up to 800 images over 45 minutes in a darkened room, accompanied by a changing soundtrack that often included Maria Callas, Petula Clark, Dionne Warwick and Dean Martin. Goldin thinks of the slideshow as a movie made with stills.Here you get lost among the prints in a different way. Their effect is cumulative and electrifying. There’s no let-up in these full-on arrays, which send the eye skittering between images, pinballing between captured moments and emotions. We go backwards and forwards in time, catching glimpses of the artist’s parents, and an old Mexican couple who seem happy enough but are a week away from their second divorce. Skinheads hanging out in a room with frightening wallpaper; Bobby masturbating; macho guys and sorrowful guys and a guy dressed as Napoleon on New Year’s Eve; someone called French Chris lying on the bonnet of a convertible, posing, his shirt open wide, like a beautiful corpse.Among the flashbacks, we encounter an empty bed in a New York brothel, wedding photos, and a cluster of photographs featuring Goldin’s black eye and bruised face, an ectopic pregnancy scar, a heart-shaped bruise. We lurch from these to tender intimacies, people dancing or having sex and lost in the moment, people alone and people coupling and uncoupling. Her titles tantalise with their brevity, just as the pictures always leave you asking: “What’s the story?” This, in part, iswhat still makes the Ballad so compelling and rewarding. Each photograph, it strikes me, leaves you on a kind of brink.View image in fullscreenPictures of innocence and experience … Warren and Jerry fighting, London (1978).Photograph: Nan Goldin/GagosianThese are pictures of innocence and experience. We begin with the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, as gruesome in the Coney Island Wax Museum as they undoubtedly were in life, and we end with a pair of skeletons screwing in a doorway, wrapped in a tender graffiti embrace. These first and last images bracket the people who move in and out of Goldin’s orbit, who shared beds and parties and holidays, tenderness and sex and silences and games of Monopoly.What strikes me now is not how louche and edgy life was for Goldin and her adoptive family of friends, but how normal their lives now seem. They don’t look lost or marginalised at all. We are now used to people posting smartphone images and videos as a kind of constantly updated and often highly self-conscious and calculated mirage of their lives. Back in the 1970s and 80s, Goldin just had a camera, and photographed on the fly. To begin with, she presented her slide shows in nightclubs and bars. Her audience were her peers.Goldin’s camera sees more than the photographer does. The apparent casualness of her approach is deceptive. The emotional texture and atmosphere of her images proves that not everyone who can hold a phone can take photographs worth looking at. When she was dancing, when she was having sex, when and wherever she was, Goldin homed in.AtGagosian, London, until 21 March.Explore more on these topicsPhotographyNan GoldinArtExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The area became a juvenile prison’Interview byDaniel Dylan WrayWed 14 Jan 2026 09.59 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Jan 2026 12.16 ESTShareIlanded in America in 1965 from Chile. I literally arrived on a banana boat. I went to the University of Notre Dame in the midwest and then to Columbia inNew York. I had a teacher – also a photographer – who taught foreign students to write and speak better English. I would try to write poetry, which he thought was terrible. I’d never taken a picture before but he encouraged me to try photography and offered to lend me the money for a Pentax Spotmatic he’d seen for sale downtown. After that, I would just walk around New York with it and take photos. It quickly became clear to me how divided the city was. Half was white and the other half was Black and Latino. There was tremendous segregation.Columbia was very prosperous. The students were well off and many were the sons of extremely rich people. I felt out of place. Also, there’s just a huge sense of loss when you leave your country and you don’t know anybody and are on your own. It made me want to look at what else was going on: to see the other side and the underside of the city. I found it easily because, in the late 60s and early 70s, deindustrialisation was going on. Big companies and car plants were shutting down and there were huge job losses and store closures. That contrast resonated with me. My family had lost a lot of money. The first part of my life was about seeing things disappear and having to make do with less and less. I was interested to see that in the US.People needed money for a fix. Sometimes they'd come at you – but they were in such bad shape I could escapeWalking around New York at the time could be dangerous. There was a lot of desperation, but the risks were part of the excitement. It made you look more carefully around you because anything could happen. There were people high on heroin on the street and looking for money to get a fix. Sometimes they would come at you but even though they were maybe younger and stronger than I was, they were in such bad shape that it was like the whole thing was going on in slow-motion. Even if they came at me with a two by four, I could escape.One day in 1970, I was walking around the Bronx and came across these kids and their dogs. I like the contrast: the impersonality of the setting but a very strong sense of personality in each person and how they were dressed, their pride in that. I always look at the urban landscape – I never think of people as being separated from where I find them. And that’s what this picture has: the group standing before the looming towers of the housing projects on this huge vacant lot – which later became a juvenile prison. Then there’s a subway line in the back. It was a very exciting shot.Huge parts of the city were being destroyed. This was my attempt to answer the question: “How do I preserve this whole damn thing?” There was a lot of good work from that period focusing on very specific things in New York, like the graffiti-painted subways, people playing in the streets, and so on. But my idea was to capture its whole urban reality. That’s what I tried to do, as big and as large as I could, from the skyline to the little details. Because these places were disappearing and it didn’t look as if they were going to come back. And they didn’t.Camilo José Vergara’s New York 1970s series is published byCafé Royal Books.View image in fullscreenCamilo José Vergara’s CVBorn:Santiago, Chile, 1944.High point:“Being honoured with a National Humanities Medal by President Barack Obama in 2012 and being named a MacArthur Fellow in 2002.”Top tip:“Be empathic and inquisitive.

Sign up hereKeza MacDonaldWed 14 Jan 2026 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Jan 2026 10.01 ESTShareStudies on gaming’s effect on the brain usually focus on aggression or the cognitive benefits of playing games. The former topic has fallen out of fashion now, after more than a decade’s worth of scientific research failed to proveany causative linkbetween video games and real-world violence. But studies on the positive effects of games have shown that performing complex tasks with your brain and hands is actually quite good for you, and that games can bebeneficial for your emotional wellbeingand stress management.That’s all well and good, but I’m obsessed with the concept of “gamer brain” – that part of us that is drawn to objectively pointless achievements. Mastering a game or finishing a story are normal sources of motivation, but gamer brain is inexplicable. When you retry the same pointless mini-game over and over because you want to get a better high score? When you walk around the invisible boundaries of a level, clicking the mouse just in case something happens? When you stay with a game longer than you should because you feel compelled to unlock that trophy or achievement? When you refuse to knock the difficulty down a level on a particularly evil boss, because that would be letting the game win? That’s gamer brain.I am not sure whether gamescausethis very particular flavour of obstinacy, or whether people with obstinate tendencies are drawn to video games. But almost everyone I know who plays a lot of video games is susceptible to it. It’s the part of you that simply will not give in, the part of you that’s determined to bend a game’s rules to your will. The extreme version of it is learning to play impossible DragonForce songs from Guitar Hero at 2X speed, just because you can. Or everything that happens atAwesome Games Done Quick(AGDQ), marathons of joyful gaming pointlessness in which people take on increasingly esoteric challenges, such as playing The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Maskblindfolded, or speeding through a cursed, modded version of Halo that’s full of random items from other games.It was this year’s AGDQ, in fact, that got me thinking again about gamer brain, and why we love this stuff. But I also thought about it a lot while playing Baby Steps last year. It’s a game that embraces yet gently mocks the concept of gamer brain – not least through its main character, the useless Nate, who embodies a bunch of stereotypical gamer characteristics, including being totally unwilling to ask for help.View image in fullscreen‘A joke you’re making with the player’ … Baby Steps.Photograph: Devolver DigitalTwo of its creators, Gabe Cuzillo and Bennett Foddy, told me a lot about this when we spoke in November. Baby Steps is full of moments that tease you, the player, into attempting ridiculous feats. At several points you’ll find big holes in the ground that you can purposefully fall into, just to see what happens (spoiler: nothing is ever down there). One character warns you away from a tower, telling you there’s no reason to climb it because there’s nothing at the top; of course, I immediately tried to climb the tower. Once, I spent 10 minutes inching my way up a river to a waterfall to see what was behind it; on the rocks behind the water was nothing but a crudely drawn penis.“There is a normal dirt path by a cliff that you can walk up perfectly safely, and then along the cliff is a series of wooden pegs that you could walk up instead, if you wanted to risk losing 20 minutes of progress,” says Foddy. “That’s a joke that you’re makingwiththe player, because for them to find that funny, they have to know that they’re tempted to walk on the pegs. If the player didn’t feel anything about that other than, ‘Oh, that’s not the correct way to go, I won’t walk on those pegs’, then there’s no joke. But the player gets it because they do want to do the difficult thing.”The most exquisite joke in all of Baby Steps, for me, comes when you find a pair of glasses that make invisible steps visible. If you decide to try to walk all the way across a bunch of rocky pillars to find these glasses, risking a fall at any moment that would waste perhaps an hour of your time, you will see a path of invisible steps that eventually lead to an invisible trophy. Nate will practically weep with joy in front of this trophy that nobody else can see, calling over a fellow hiker to admire it, who of course can only see Nate dancing around triumphantly in front of absolutely nothing.View image in fullscreenDogged … Nathan Drake, right, in Unchartered 4: A Thief’s End.Photograph: Sony Computer Entertainment“The joke that we keep coming back to is when the player puts themselves in a particular psychological or emotional state and then Nate gets to reflect that in some way,” Foddy says. “You’re seeing yourself reflected in this loser. That’s the deep joke: this guy, this couch potato, he’s actually you in this moment.”Cuzillo, who also voices Nate, has a chronic case of gamer brain. “Over time, we came around to this idea that a lot of the level design is an opportunity for introspection about why you’re playing the game at all, what kinds of rewards you’re attuned to and why you play games in general,” he says. “You’re asked as a player: What do you care about? Who are you as a person? If you don’t jump into the hole, you’re [left] wondering for the rest of the game about whether you should have jumped in the hole.”Gamer brain is thought of as a masculine concept, though I can attest that you don’t have to be a man to suffer from it. “I think this is a gendered type of play, toxic masculine play, or at least it’s constructed as such,” Foddy says. “That stuff is riddled through gaming culture. It’s riddled through the kinds of characters that players are asked to embody. Nathan Drake in Uncharted is determined and full of grit, but is that the same thing as being obstinate and dogged and pursuing something stupid?”Baby Steps is one of those games that you can only truly appreciate if you have a bit of gamer brain in you. Trying to explain why it’s funny is close to impossible – you have to have some understanding of the compulsion and strange transcendence of pursuing pointless objectives. But here’s the key thing about gamer brain, and perhaps about games in general: these things aren’t pointless if they actually mean something to you.What to playView image in fullscreenComforting, achievable January play … Sword of the Sea.Photograph: Giant SquidWhen I startedSword of the Sealast night and found myself surfing over dunes of tastefully rendered animated sand, I immediately thought ofJourney. Alotof this game brings Journey to mind, from the art style and animation to the minimal demands that it makes of you as a player. But you know what? It’s been almost 15 years since that landmark PlayStation 3 game, and it’s been lovely to play something that channels its best moments. You swoosh around the desert, occasionally jumping, occasionally pressing square to make something happen, finding places where your magical sword can bring water back to your arid surroundings. After you’ve flooded the former desert, you surf around on the water instead, ocean creatures flitting around you. It is beautiful, mindful and soothing, if admittedly a little insubstantial; I have found it a comforting, achievable January play.Available on:PS5, PCEstimated playtime:2-3 hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenEpic battle … Hollow Knight: Silksong.Photograph: Team CherryThis week Iwrote aboutplayingHollow Knight: Silksongwhile living with a chronic pain condition; this beautiful, punishing game has become emblematic of a time when I was thinking a lot about the nature of suffering.Lego’s take onPokémonhasfinally been revealed, featuring a £579.99 Kanto evolutions set and a rather unfortunate-looking Pikachu.

But what’s the best way to find them?First of all, congratulations on deciding to expand your gaming intake. There’s nothing wrong with blockbuster games, but it’s really lovely to discover brand new – and sometimes incredibly weird – experiences. Aside from the Guardian’s regular indie recs, of course, the front page of digital video game storeItch.iois a good starting point – a lot of smaller developers put their new projects on there and it’s quite well curated.Steamalso runs regular indie promotions, including an annual indie festival, and it’s worth watching the annualIndie Gameawards,IndieCadeandGamesfor Changefor interesting titles. There are lots of review sites specialising in indie titles, too – for example,Indie Game ReviewerandJohn Walker’s Buried Treasure. Elsewhere,Blueskyis great for following indie developers – there are lots of lists and starter packs to join, which will give you instant access to indie communities. You can search Bluesky’s directory for suggestions. The good thing is, the more indie games you play, the more you get to know the developers and community, and the more new ones you discover.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – hit reply or email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s why we make the best Traitors contestantsErin KellyBarrister turned novelist Harriet Tyce is playing a blinder in the fourth series of the show. As a thriller writer myself, I recognise the traits that make her such a formidable FaithfulWed 14 Jan 2026 06.06 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Jan 2026 11.50 ESTShareThis time last year a rumour swept through the close-knit British crime-writing community, not whispered in a quiet moment in the billiard room but shared on group chats and message boards. The producers ofThe Traitorswere recruiting contestants for 2026, and wanted one of us to take part. Ofcoursethey did! The Traitors is a controlled, lower-stakes, stylised version of the golden age country house whodunnit, which is itself a controlled, lower-stakes, stylised version of real-life murder. It is crime writers’ job to examine the dark side of human behaviour. Betrayal of trust and manipulation are all in a day’s work. We often write from multiple perspectives, identifying with victim, perp and detective, giving us a unique kind of empathy. We spent the rest of the year wondering who it would be. (I didn’t get the call.)Last November, in that howling no man’s land between the finale of Celebrity Traitors and the transmission of series four, I went along with 13 fellow crime novelists to the Traitors Live Experience in Covent Garden. Despite being professional pattern-finders with highly tuned powers of observation, none of us at the replica round table guessed that the Chosen One was among us, and had already completed her stint on the real thing.Harriet Tyce, the barrister turned thriller writer, is perfect for the show, says former detective and bestselling novelist Clare Mackintosh. “The cat-and-mouse game in crime and thriller novels isn’t only between detective and villain, it’s between author and reader – who will reach the truth first? Whether Traitor or Faithful, a crime writer makes a formidable opponent.”To make plot twists work, we have to create characters who are good at pretending to be good guysMark EdwardsMark Edwards, Traitors superfan and author of The Wasp Trap, agrees. “When talking to my family about The Traitors I referred to the players as ‘characters’, a slip that proves I watch it in the same way I read crime fiction. Writing crime novels makes us very good at games. That’s why Harriet was able to see that Hugo was a Traitor immediately.”Ah yes, the takedown that launched a thousand memes. Harriet’s uncloaking of Traitor Hugo in episode three was masterly. It’s one thing to have your suspicions, another to present them convincingly. Her speech was the stuff of the courtroom dramas she writes; eloquent, controlled, incisive. “It has occurred to me from the moment that I found out that you were a barrister that you would be a prime target for the Traitors to take out,” she said, as the nation watched with barely controlled lust. “You have experience at cross-examination, you’re good at presenting your case and you’re highly articulate.” She closed with: “Those are hard facts, as far as I’m concerned.” In Ardross Castle, hard facts are thinner on the ground than protective Shields, but by presenting theory as data, Harriet made sure itbecamefact. Misdirection is all about delivering near-truths with such panache that the reader doesn’t question it. In a show in which so many banishments are vibes-based (“I’m voting for yourself because you took the last croissant at breakfast”), a novelist’s persuasive skills are powerful.View image in fullscreen‘Prime target’ … Hugo, on left, in The Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan CherryHarriet is, in Traitors parlance, “playing a blinder”. (We will overlook her misstep with Ross, the most doomed Faithful ever. All good sleuths have a fatal flaw.) I’m not sure writing mysteriesautomaticallyqualifies one to excel at the game. We spend most of our time alone, typing and wearing fleeces covered in pet hair. Yes, I practice to deceive, but it takes me months to get those plot twists down on paper. In conversation, I fumble my words and, like Stephen the Traitor, I’m a blusher. That said, authors do develop soft skills that might equip them well for life in the castle. In my time at literary festivals and libraries, I’ve learned how to engage a room of strangers quickly. “To be a successful author you have to be comfortable talking to people and making them like you,” says Edwards. “The players who are good at networking, like Jessie, are far less likely to be banished.”That’s our suitability for the Faithfuls established, but what of the dark side? “To make twists work,” says Edwards, “we have to be able to create characters who are good at lying and pretending to be good guys. These baddies are always the most fun characters to write, and I think we would all relish the chance to be one of them, if only for a few weeks.”When we played the Traitors Live, Harriet began as a Faithful but was recruited as a Traitor halfway through the game. If she crosses the floor in the show, the day job will give her further advantage. Crime writers love playing with dramatic irony. We are puppet masters, never happier than when the readers know something the characters don’t. What is that if not the essence of Traitorhood? That, and the inability to resist a chance to make mischief.The Night Stairs by Erin Kelly is published by Vintage in July. To support the Guardian, pre-order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

A quarter of a century on from its Channel 4 debut, why has it fallen so far off the radar?Daniel Dylan WrayWed 14 Jan 2026 06.13 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Jan 2026 11.50 ESTShareThere are few British comedy shows that were as popular, yet now completely extinct, as Phoenix Nights. The sitcom – which ran for just two series between 2001-2002 – is set in a fictional working men’s club in Bolton, and was a huge hit of the physical media era. Its second series was once the fastest ever selling UK TV show on DVD, shifting 160,000 copies in its first week of release. However, it is now 25 years since it was first broadcast on Channel 4, and it does not feature, nor has it ever, on any streaming service. Instead, it’s confined to dodgy fan uploads on YouTube and the secondhand DVD market. It is also almost entirely absent from all of the major publications’ best TV of the 21st century listicles.Nevertheless, it remains a programme like few others. Distinctly northern and working class, it crucially uses neither as the butt of its jokes. In the same way that The Royle Family turned the everyday routine of watching TV, bickering, having a brew and asking each other what they had for tea into a relatably funny yet poignant shared living-room experience, Phoenix Nights invites people through its sparkling tinsel curtains into the familiar yet fading glory of clubland.View image in fullscreenThe cast of Phoenix Nights.Photograph: Channel 4The show is a spin-off from an episode of ThatPeter KayThing, the 1999 spoof documentary series, and was written by Kay, Dave Spikey and Neil Fitzmaurice. Kay plays the lead, Brian Potter, a choleric, acerbic yet bitingly funny club owner who, when not busy being a ceaseless cheapskate, can be found rolling around the club in his wheelchair topping up his whisky glass – which is a flower vase, so that he can reach the optics on the top shelf.Loaded with eccentric characters, wonderful details and sharp-eyed observations, it is material plucked straight from smoke-filled bingo halls and dilapidated function rooms. A world of curled sandwiches at daytime wakes, as people rest pints on coffin lids and fruit machines bleep away, clashing with blaring TVs, the clack of pool balls and the idle chat of regulars. Over 12 episodes, the club encounters a drunk horse during a themed wild west night, guest spots from Catchphrase’s Roy Walker and Bullseye’s Jim Bowen. There’s even a kid’s playground concocted around a portable toilet and scaffolding in the car park, complete with a poorly disguised adult-themed bouncy castle.View image in fullscreenNeil Fitzmaurice as Ray Von and Peter Kay as Brian Potter.Photograph: Channel 4While the show has become synonymous with its most famous star – Kay also plays one half of the bumbling bouncer duo, Max and Paddy, with Paddy McGuinness – it really is an ensemble comedy that succeeds due to the eclectic figures that fill the club. There’s Ray Von (Fitzmaurice), an enthusiastic DJ, dodgy electrician and rumoured murderer; Jerry St Clair (Spikey), the long-suffering club compere who finds himself singing about bin bags in Asda; compulsive liar Kenny Senior (Archie Kelly); the hapless clairvoyant Clinton Baptiste (Alex Lowe); Holy Mary (Janice Connolly), the club’s strict catholic barmaid; and the obnoxious cigar-chomping Den Perry (Ted Robbins), who is Potter’s arch-nemesis and rival club owner. Phoenix Nights is a contained and intimate sitcom, but it’s bursting at the seams with unique characters that make up the club’s hodgepodge community.View image in fullscreenPaddy McGuinness as Paddy in Phoenix Nights.Photograph: Channel 4One character, Keith Lard – an overly officious fire safety officer who is rumoured to be engaged in bestiality with dogs – landed the show in trouble. Keith Laird, a real-life fire safety officer in Bolton, complained and was paid compensation, forcing Channel 4 to issue an apology despite Kay insisting the character was fictional.Understandably, for a show that is a quarter of a century old and based around a working men’s club – a culture which peaked decades earlier – there’s some material that wouldn’t fly today. The second series notably dips in quality and the poor choice to write in a couple of problematic Chinese immigrant characters led to deserved criticisms, even from a member of its own cast. The alternative comedian Daniel Kitson, who played barman Spencer, called the show “lazy and racist”.View image in fullscreenKay as Potter …Photograph: Channel 4Such views have unquestionably affected the reputation and legacy of the show, with Kay recently saying he wouldn’t want it on streaming sites like Netflix as it would likely need a content warning these days. However, in retrospect, the show is much softer, and dafter, at its heart than the widerTV comedylandscape of the 2000s. In an era where Black face was still happening, sexism was rife, and many shows were rooted in nasty humiliation and cruel demonisation, Phoenix Nights, for the most part, offered a comforting antidote.Flawed, sure, but it remains something of an anomaly in British TV. It carved out a singular space in a corner of the comedy world – in terms of region, class and content – that is frequently shunned by mainstream broadcasters. Twenty-five years on, with depressingly low numbers of working-class people working in, and on, TV, a comedy show that felt like a one-off at the time, continues to be. So maybe it’s time to swing by your local charity shop to see if you can find the DVD of this increasingly forgotten gem.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionPeter KayTV comedyComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I don’t stop thinking about him. For me, there’s no replacement; I just have a void. If I could speak to him I’d say: “Come back, because I can’t really bear being without you.”We saw each other or spoke every day since 1980. I was a third party in the marriage, but Rima was never jealous. When we met for the first time, he let me stay at his house. He was in bed and I just jumped up and down on his body with excitement, but it wasn’t sexual. Then we both got into the RSC and rented a house together we called Shakespeare Sauna.View image in fullscreen‘I just jumped up and down on his body with excitement’ … Wax and Rickman in 2009.Photograph: Nick Harvey/WireImageWe had a pet tortoise, Betty, who I got into every RSC show, which made Alan scream. We’d dress her up – that’s the kind of sense of humour he had. But then I made her ride a bicycle, and had her walk across Gower Street, and got reported to the RSPCA, who took her away.There isn’t a day that goes by when I don’t see something he would find hilarious. I did everything for Alan; if I could make him laugh that was like winning an Oscar. He steered my career for the first 30 years and I think I’d be doing much better now if he was still around. I don’t have anybody like that I can trust.Nobody was a better critic of your acting. He was a genius who could see into the heart of a performance and know instinctively what about the person was getting in the way. He could see your ego and wanted to edit it. Some people couldn’t take it because he could do it with cruelty – he was intolerant if people weren’t listening. But he was always right.He used to tell me to not look desperate when I was doing comedy and tell me I was smiling as if I wanted everyone to love me. When he directed my shows he’d do my comedy for me in the right way and clean the floor. He wasn’t gay, but he delivered lines in high, high camp. And then I’d sort of sadly imitate him.It was such a deep connection. He wanted to take care of me and would defend me against my parents who were vicious. He’d tell them I had talent, which they didn’t believe, but they listened to him and they let me continue. Each time I’d get off the plane from visiting them in Chicago I’d perform for Alan what they’d said and done to me. He would bend over laughing. That was the only time he didn’t give me notes. He’d just say it was brilliant.View image in fullscreen‘My children are bereft’ … Alan Rickman and Ruby Wax admiring their names outside the Royal Shakespeare Company 1978.Photograph: Courtesy of Ruby WaxAlan was godfather to my children and they’re bereft, because he steered them too. At school, my daughter Maddie was really shy, hardly spoke. In plays, she’d be in the back, playing a leaf. Alan told her: “You have to go to clown school.” At the time I thought: why is he doing this to me? But now, she’s a comedian. He opened her up like a can. He would’ve been so proud that my daughters are comedians but he would have given them endless notes.It was such a privilege to have known him for so long, back when he was raw, before he was famous. I could see the gold when he was just doing Shakespeare. I wish he wasn’t only remembered by kids for being Snape. I’d begged him to do films, but he kept turning them down, saying he’d be stereotyped. And, lo and behold, he ended up a stereotype for a lot of people.Nowadays, I see people trying to imitate him, but they can’t pull it off. Nobody gets close to Alan. There are people who are ethereal or male or female or a certain age or a certain type. He was something totally unique. Alan was unreal.‘There was always dinner’Lindsay DuncanDeath often feels like an aberration. In Alan’s case, it was a hell of an aberration. Surely he wouldn’t allow it? Of course, even he couldn’t control this one, or could he? Famously, he chose every detail of his funeral. Of course he did. Was it good? You bet it was. He wouldn’t have died until it was perfect.View image in fullscreen‘He could be imperious’ … (from left): James Earl Jones, Lynn Redgrave, Lindsay Duncan and Alan Rickman in New York in 1987 when Les Liaisons Dangereuses was on Broadway.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveAlan loved a good time. He loved making a good time for other people. His dressing rooms were always a party. There were politicians, movie stars, old friends, new friends and plenty of wine, elegantly poured by Alan. Then there was dinner. Always dinner. If anyone looked as though they might be going home alone, they were scooped up and nervous maître d’s learned that the huge cachet of havingAlan Rickmanin their restaurant was accompanied by a hasty adjustment to the size of the table.Fame really suited Alan. He joyfully shared all the upsides with his friends. Those many dinners were paid for by him and objections were met with a little smile and “I’ve got two words to say to you: Harry. Potter”. He could be imperious. He could be cross. Once, at a cast dinner, he got into a political row and called his understudy a Tory cunt. The next day, barely controlling his face, he just said: “Oops …” He did apologise.View image in fullscreen‘Magnificent’ … Lindsay Duncan and Alan Rickman in Private Lives in London, 2001.Photograph: Robbie Jack/Corbis/Getty ImagesListen to Alan performing Revolutionary Witness, and Tom Waits’s Take It With Me and Uptown Funk – again. Some of his funeral soundtrack. Think, cry, laugh and party. That’s Alan. A magnificent man.‘It was one of the worst nights of his life’Richard CurtisIt’s a pretty open secret that when three of us had the final vote for who should play the lead in Four Weddings and a Funeral, I was out-voted. I wanted Alan Rickman. Hugh Grant got the part. My reasoning was that Hugh was a bit too handsome and annoying, but mainly I voted for Alan because I’d so loved him in a film called Close My Eyes. In the years that followed Four Weddings, with each new film Alan did, from Sense and Sensibility to An Awfully Big Adventure to Galaxy Quest, I kept seeing reasons why I might have been right. He had such a wonderful softness and depth next to his stern, scarier side. And a great sense of comedy.But I did also always think he was a bit out of my league, so it was such a thrill when he agreed to be in Love Actually 10 years later. I thought he was wonderful in the film, and a huge part of the power of Emma Thompson weeping to Joni Mitchell in the bedroom is because Alan has been so believable; a million miles from the cliched cad the character could have been. He’s extraordinary in the scene where Emma faces him with what he’s done. He made it easy for me during the filming – it was my first film as director – and I was surprised by how friendly he was, and unsurprised by how pitch-perfect his performance was.View image in fullscreen‘I’ll never forget Alan’s agony’ … Rowan Atkinson and Alan Rickman in Love Actually.Photograph: Ronald GrantI’m sure Alan wouldn’t mind me talking about the only tricky night we had. It was the scene where Rowan Atkinson is wrapping a present for him in a department store, very slowly. First we shot Alan, who did his work swiftly and exquisitely. Then we turned the camera on Rowan. Rowan, being a close friend of mine and having about 10 different stages to remember, took his time, often stopped and chatted with me in the middle of takes, us keeping the camera running while he worked out what to do with rosebuds and sticks of lavender, breaking out of character, practising. I’ll never forget Alan’s agony as, total professional that he was, he kept up his supportive and nervous performance for 12 minute takes, never dropping out of character for a moment as we chatted and dithered. He described it as one of the worst nights of his life.It is heart-breaking how many wonderful years and wonderful performances of his we’ve missed.‘We gobbled blueberry pie and cheered each other on’Sigourney WeaverTen years … it seems so much longer. An eternity since we last heard Alan’s gorgeous laugh boom out. I first saw him in Les Liaisons Dangereuses on Broadway; so convincing in his wickedness I assumed it was the real him … yes, and I’m an actor.View image in fullscreen‘Our stomachs ached with laughter’ … Rickman and Weaver in Galaxy Quest (1999).Photograph: Dreamworks Skg/AllstarYears later we met for real on the film Galaxy Quest. Here was this sublimely playful man who surrendered utterly to portraying a washed up TV hack, seething with petty jealousy and clawing at his giant shell-cap. His character grounded us all. Tim Allen made us laugh so hard all day long, and no one more so than Alan. Our stomachs ached at the end of every day.Shortly afterwards, Alan asked me to do Snow Cake with him: a romantic lead for him and for me the challenge of playing an autistic woman called Linda. I was so astonished that he could imagine me as Linda, I researched it for a full year so I wouldn’t let him down. We shot it way up in Wawa, Canada, gobbling blueberry pie and cheering each other on. When Linda would veer out of her lane, Alan would say firmly: “I do not improvise.”View image in fullscreen‘I do not improvise’ … director Marc Evans, Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman at the Edinburgh premiere of Snow Cake, 2006.Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The GuardianI made the idiot mistake of thinking this brilliant friend would be with us for ever. At Mike Nichols’ memorial in November 2015, he came up to me with his wife, Rima. I threw my arms around him and said: “Hey, we’re going to do another Galaxy Quest!” He looked at me quietly and said: “We’ll see.” I said: “What do you mean? It’s gonna be so much fun.” He squeezed my shoulders, looked down and said very gently: “We’ll see.” He was gone two months later, for ever to be missed.‘There was nothing flaky about him. No nonsense, no rubbish’Brian CoxI can’t believe it’s been 10 years since we lost Alan. His death was such a shock. My father died of pancreatic cancer when I was eight – and my first wife’s father also died of the same disease. With Alan, I first felt guilty, because we hadn’t been in touch for a while. And then I wondered: what’s going to happen? How will the world be now Alan’s gone? Because he had this way of making people feel easy. He could take their cares away. It was an incredible gift.‘He looked laid-back but he was very driven’ … Rickman and Brian Cox in Thérèse Raquin.I worked with Alan on his first TV show: Thérèse Raquin in 1980. He immediately had a solidity and clarity about him, as well that amazing gravity and integrity. He’d started as a graphic artist, which had left him with a very fine visual sense, and also a real discipline. His standards were very high. Alan might have appeared laid-back but he was endlessly driven, very firm, totally reliable. There was nothing flaky about him. No nonsense. No rubbish.Everyone knew he was an extraordinary actor, but as we became friends, I realised what an extraordinary person he was, too. I had such respect for Alan. So many people relied on him. He was so kind and supportive to those who were struggling: he’d seek them out and sort them out. Listen to problems without presumption and gently come up with solutions.He had an incredible generosity of spirit, as well as a commitment to serving his community and being present in people’s lives. His death made me conscious of the need to keep in touch with people and see them often. A presence such as his is missed for a long time. I still occasionally think: oh, I’d like to talk to Alan about this. Then I remember he’s not here any more. I loved his acting, but as a man I loved him even more.‘I nearly broke his back’Sharleen SpiteriWhen we planned the video for Texas’s In Demand in 2000, the director had the idea I would dance the tango with someone. I said I didn’t want it to be with some random gorgeous man because that’d just be soulless – it needed to be someone you thought would dance the tango. Then [composer] Michael Kamen walked in and said he was just off the phone with Alan Rickman, who was a big fan of Texas. Everybody looked at each other and went: “Now there’s somebody that would dance the tango.” Alan agreed, and even cancelled the first week of his annual holiday in Italy to do it.We shot the video overnight and it was so, so cold. Most of the shoot was driving around in a Bentley but then we did the tango in a petrol station about 5am. I was in this backless Valentino dress and high heels, freezing my bollocks off. Alan was in a suit. The crew had giant puffer coats. At one point the director shouted: “Shar! Throw him against the petrol pump like you’re about to fuck his brains out!” I did. Then about two seconds after the bit that’s in the video, he slid very slowly back down the petrol pump. I’d got so excited I nearly broke his back.‘Throw him against the petrol pump like you’re about to fuck his brains out!’ … the video for In Demand.Fifteen years later, Texas had a song, Start a Family, I thought would make a good duet. I phoned Alan and said: “How do you fancy singing on a record?” And he went: “Oh, good God …” in that wonderful drawling voice of his. In the end, most of it was more speaking than singing, but he did break into a little bit of melody in places. It was great watching him interpret the music. And we had an absolute laugh filming the video: putting on our very serious faces, then giggling between takes.He was so naughty and mischievous and always had a serious glint in his eye. We had the best time together. But I really loved that he – like me – also took the work very seriously. It wasn’t about being famous or where you’re seen or who you’re seen with. It was about being privileged enough to be doing the thing you’d dreamed of, with creative people.He was so generous with his time and love and friendship, and always very giving with people who were just coming up: exchanging contacts and connecting people and giving them chances. I loved it because I met so many people through him. I’ve never been so close to someone so famous.‘ I think he’s still at the end of the phone’ … the video for Start a Family.Whenever he’d ring me on speakerphone in my car and someone else was with me their eyes would nearly pop out of their head. That amazing voice! The depth and richness and enunciation. I remember my daughter and her friends being in the car when they were about seven and had just got intoHarry Potter. When Alan rang they lost their minds: “Oh my God! It’s Snape!”There’s a part of my mind in which I think he’s still at the end of the phone. He was on TV all over Christmas; I’d have it on in the background and suddenly I’d hear his voice. That bit of him stays alive. It was a really lovely and warm and comforting feeling. At the supermarket last week, a stranger hugged me and said: “You danced with Alan Rickman! You’re the luckiest woman on the planet!” I was like: you know what? I am pretty damn lucky.‘He might be alarmed at today’s tyranny’Ian RicksonView image in fullscreen‘I remember him it emboldens me to fight for what I believe in’ … Ian Rickson in 2021.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianAlan was unafraid to express his radical political perspective. And he was unashamedly a believer in the arts.In holding both of these two positions he also articulated the interdependence of culture and meaning. He embraced his craft, and particularly the role of theatre as a political medium.He might be alarmed at how much more tyranny and inequality there is now, and also how much harder people feel it is to speak out about it. And with his working-class origins I know he’d worry about the increasing elitism in the business.So when I remember him it emboldens me to fight for what I believe in, and relish the privilege I have in getting to make theatre.‘Praise from Alan counted far more than a critic’s review’Harriet WalterAlan was never a nobody. Even when he was an unknown 32-year-old, when I first met him in the bar at the old Bush theatre, he seemed like somebody. “Oh, I’ve heard aboutyou,” he drawled in that beautiful voice. His searchlight gaze had fallen on me and for that moment he mademefeel like somebody.The first play I did with him was The Seagull at the Royal Court. I didn’t have to act Nina’s fascination with Trigorin. We also did a restoration comedy together. He was brilliantly funny both on and off stage. I don’t think he was easy to direct. He was too much of a director himself. You wanted to do your best for him. Praise from Alan, even then, counted far more than any critic’s review.View image in fullscreen‘I didn’t have to act Nina’s fascination with Trigorin’ … Harriet Walter and Alan Rickman in The Seagull.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyI remember a phone call with him around that time, gossiping about any jobs we had been offered. I had plumped gratefully for the first thing that came my way, while Alan recited a list of roles he had turned down. He was paring down his choices with what I soon learned was an acute sense of where he was heading and where he was supposed to be. If this sounds offensive, it wasn’t. He was a rocket that was perfectly prepared but hadn’t yet been launched. When the part of Obadiah Slope in Barchester Chronicles came his way he recognised his moment and he pounced.Then there was Les Liaisons Dangereuses and then there was Die Hard playing Bruce Willis’s nemesis. Wow! My old mate Alan had become a film star – a fully fledged Somebody – and he took to that status as the proverbial duck to water.His generosity and kindness were legendary as was his brilliant sense of humour – a unique combination of wry sophistication and silliness that is evident in many of his film roles. When I worked with him again in Sense and Sensibility, although our characters didn’t meet we spent plenty of social time on location.Alan took care of me, made sure I dined with him and the top cast at the top tier hotel restaurant and paid for the cab back to my not quite top tier hotel some 10 miles away. He threw a birthday party for me in the year my partner died from cancer. He knew it would be a hard one for me.View image in fullscreen‘I am almost happy for him that he left when he did’ … Richard Wilson, Alan Rickman, Harriet Walter and Emma Fielding at a Royal Court gala, 2009.Photograph: Alan DavidsonAlan elevated friendship to an art form. His friends grew in number throughout his extraordinary career but he never dropped his old pals in favour of more starry ones. He was unusually loyal. I marvelled at how he managed to see nearly all of our performances and wine and dine us afterwards. Stardom didn’t change him because he had always been a star, albeit a very well-grounded one.So much has happened in the world in the 10 years since he died. I miss his piercing intelligence now more than ever. It is terribly sad for all of us that he has gone but I am almost happy for him that he left when he did.‘He queued for breakfast in his Snape costume and wig’Tom FeltonWhen I think about Alan a smile always comes to my face. I was lucky enough to work with him for 11 years at Leavesden studios on Harry Potter.I remember how intimidated I was when I first saw him. Not because of his portrayal of the seemingly evil Professor Snape but because he was the only cast member I actually recognised.View image in fullscreen‘He turned slowly to me and said: ‘I’ve peaked’’ … Tom Felton with Rickman as Snape in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyAs an 11-year-old, I had no idea who Sir Richard Harris or Dame Maggie Smith were, but Alan was big time! Seeing the man who’d played that brilliantly villainous role as the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves seated at the end of the Headteacher’s table in Hogwarts’ Great Hall was very memorable.He was nothing but kind, genuine, seemingly unfazed by anything happening around us and always had time for everyone. I learned just as much – if not more – from Alan off-camera as I did when we were filming.He could have had his food delivered to his trailer, like most of the cast (including me). Instead, he queued up for his own breakfast and lunch, head to toe in his Snape costume and wig, holding a plastic tray and waiting his turn in the usually very long line behind a carpenter, set decorator, burly cameraman and Gringotts goblin – an image I will never forget. I didn’t realise it then, but I think now Alan’s silent message was: “We’re all in this together. Equally.”I remember the night shoot when Hagrid’s hut was set on fire. It was about 4am and freezing cold. We stood together on a grassy bank, Helena Bonham Carter and Robbie Coltrane battling behind us. Alan didn’t utter a word. I finally mustered the courage to ask him: “You all right, Alan? How you feeling?” About 10 seconds after I’d spoken he turned his head to me and replied slowly: “I’ve peaked.” He then turned his head back with the tiniest hint of a smile and a twinkle in his eye.View image in fullscreen‘If children visited, he’d sneer and tell them to tuck their shirt in’ … Rickman as Snape.Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarHe taught me a great deal about charity. He would often have half a dozen people visit the studio each day, and would claim they were his cousins or friends. Really, he was offering terminally ill children and their families a chance to see behind the curtains. He also taught me that children don’t want to meet actors, but the characters they play.I would usually greet a nine-year-old visitor by saying: “Hello, how’s it going mate?” which would usually freak them out: “Why is Draco being so happy?!” Alan would sneer at them in front of their parents, then tell them to tuck their shirts in and clip them round the ear. Full Snape. Charming, disarming and a delight to watch. He never smiled. But when I look back, I think he probably was inside.‘He kind of loved you – in a way that wasn’t creepy’Anna ChancellorI must have met Alan before I became his employee, but he wasn’t my friend. So when he cast me in Creditors, which he directed, I was amazed and incredibly flattered because anyone would have worked for Alan.It was a golden time: just the three of us in the cast – me, Tom Burke and Owen Teale. Alan hardly ever directed so he didn’t have the weariness of a lot of jobbing directors. He was very inspired and wanted to translate what had and hadn’t worked for him as an actor to us. He’d start by asking you for any ideas you had about the play, your part, anyone else’s part, the costumes, and write them down in his very beautiful handwriting. No thought was unnecessary or wrong. And that doesn’t sound very radical, but actually it’s not common.View image in fullscreen‘His care was a turning point for me’ … Tom Burke, Alan Rickman, Anna Chancellor and Owen Teale at the press night for Creditors, 2008.Photograph: Dan Wooller/ShutterstockMost directors aren’t actors. And Alan felt so personally about things that had gone well, and very deeply about things that hadn’t. He was very sensitive about times he’d felt sort of shamed. So he kept saying to us three: “You are all just perfect.”He was also a hard taskmaster. He clearly understood that there are rules and mechanics and techniques, which he’d thought very deeply about. For instance: you shouldn’t start one sentence on the same pitch as you finished the one before. He knew his own failings as an actor; that sometimes his voice could be ponderous and drop at the end. He didn’t want you to do that.What he hated most of all was if you indicated to an audience what you were thinking before you thought it, with ums and oohs and ahhs. He called them “trampolines”. He didn’t want you trampolining; he wanted you to come inbang, snap, sharpwith clarity of thought.He once lined us all up and said: “Anna, this is what you do,” and ran his hands through his hair. “That is your habit. And when you bend down you sort of stick your arse in the air. Don’t do that.” I think a lot of directors wouldn’t say that to you; they might feel it was stepping a bit beyond their remit.He was stricter with the guys. As an actress, I felt so seen by him and so appreciated. His care was a turning point for me. I just adored him. He kind of loved you, in a way that wasn’t creepy. He was very interested in you and very clear about what you and only you could bring. He made you feel like you had what no one else had.The play transferred from the Donmar to New York, where it was much better received. Alan was there every night and after the show he would open the dressing room door and in would walk Al Pacino or Liam Neeson or Susan Sarandon. It was a dream. I’ve known people with money but I’ve never known anyone pick up a bill like Alan. He was the most generous person I’ve ever met. If your friend was in town, he’d pay for their ticket and then book you into one of Keith McNally’s fabulous restaurants.One day I woke with the most unbelievable headache. I couldn’t see. I rang Alan and he said to come over. When I got to his flat I was sick everywhere. We went to hospital and Alan sat with me as they went through all my medical history, so it became a different sort of relationship.View image in fullscreen‘As soon as I got to Alan’s fabulous flat I was sick everywhere’ … Tom Burke and Anna Chancellor in Creditors.Photograph: Robbie Jack/Corbis/Getty ImagesIn order to test for viral meningitis – which is what I had – I had a lumbar puncture, which leaked, so Alan and I went to a special clinic where they take blood from your arm and they put it back into your body and it forms a plaster over the hole. The doctor told us that I should avoid sudden, loud movements in case the blood clot dislodge.I said: “Oh, really? Because, Alan, what about when I really scream at the end of the play?” And he went: “Don’t worry, we can just come back and get another plaster.” That’s what you sign up for as an actor: if you’re unwell, you still go on.I went to see Alan a lot when he was in hospital, but still as my mentor, not my friend. Then, in 2024, I went to Mexico for the day of the dead to scatter the ashes ofmy daughter, Poppy, and randomly met Ruby Wax on the plane. I said she should print out a picture of Alan, and we made an impromptu shrine in one of these huge, beautiful cemeteries in Oaxaca. We lit candles and we told stories and it was very moving. Alan would have loved it.‘I could not reconcile myself to his absence’Helena Kennedy KCView image in fullscreen‘His death was such a theft’ … Helena Kennedy KC in 2019.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianTen years ago; it does not seem possible. His death was such a theft from us; this brilliant, gorgeous actor, who had so much more to give, was suddenly gone. Although I was one of the close friends who was privy to Alan’s illness and visited him as he faded, I could not reconcile myself to his absence.Alan was undoubtedly one of Britain’s greatest actors. His distinctive languid voice and his sublime ability to embody the characters he played made him truly exceptional. So many of his stage and film performances were breathtaking. My good fortune was that I also knew his other attributes, as a keen fighter for the good of the world, with a strong sense of injustice. It was no surprise that Alan with Katharine Viner created the very moving playMy Name is Rachel Corrie, about the young American activist who was killed while peacefully opposing house demolitions in Gaza, or that his last film, Eye in the Sky, was about the moral responsibility governments bear regarding their use of drones.Alan was such a vivid presence in my life and played such an important role in so many of our family events – the dinners where he insisted that Harry Potter was paying; the fundraisers for my husband’s medical research foundation; Saving Faces; the thrill for my children of knowing the Sheriff of Nottingham and then Severus Snape! We relished the holiday where he and his wife, Rima, joined us in Cape Cod and were beach bums like the rest of us.View image in fullscreen‘A keen fighter for the good of the world’ … Megan Dodds in My Name is Rachel Corrie, 2005.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianWhat countless people in the arts and beyond will remember about Alan was his kindness, his fostering of the talents of others, his financial aid to those who needed help. He was generous of his time, of his heart, and of his encouragement. He was a giant in his profession and a prince among men.‘I was fascinated by his subtle, attractive air of melancholy’Heike MakatschView image in fullscreen‘He sent a bouquet of flowers with a note saying how much he had appreciated his mistress’ … Heike Makatsch and Alan Rickman in Love Actually.Photograph: Moviestore/REX/ShutterstockEven though it feels a lifetime ago, I still remember vividly the few days of filming I was lucky enough to share with Alan on Love Actually. I felt a little out of place, and at times shy, surrounded by such well-known, top-of-the-list actors whose warm and layered performances I had long admired from afar.To this day, I remain grateful for the generosity with which Alan made me feel welcome on set, always stepping in with quiet support whenever nerves threatened to get the better of me. He was gentle, witty, helpful, and wonderfully modest, appearing during shooting breaks with instant coffee and biscuits, only to impress me moments later with his acting skills and perfectly timed double-takes. I was fascinated by the subtle, attractive air of melancholy that seemed to follow him everywhere.And when filming Love Actually came to an end, he sent a bouquet of flowers to my doorstep, with a note saying how much he had appreciated his mistress, Mia. I was really chuffed. Looking back, I wish I had allowed myself to enjoy his company more, instead of placing him on a pedestal he never chose to stand on.‘Alan told Jimmy Kimmel: “No, it’s more of a dick flick”’Stephen ReaElegant, stylish, sophisticated. A glorious actor. Tremendously perceptive about performance. When he saw a show he could give notes that only a great actor would have observed. In a warm and generous manner.He lived up to the original identity of his name – Rickman – princely, regal. And he was famed for his wit. Interviewed by Jimmy Kimmel: “So this is a chick flick?” Alan replied: “No, it’s more of a dick flick.”‘Tremendously perceptive’ … Rickman in Michael Collins.And when he received an award for his performance as the Sheriff of Nottingham, he remarked that every time he looked at it he would realise “subtlety isn’t everything”. Hilarious. Classy. Forever missed.‘That a man so incredible chose to stay in touch made me feel special’Kevin SmithIn 1997, Alan got in touch to say he’d really liked Chasing Amy and to ask what we were doing next. So I got to work with a man whose work I’d always appreciated so much that if it wasn’t released in the US, I’d seek it out in specialist video stores.One day on Dogma, I saw him and Jason Mewes sitting on the church steps together, deeply engaged in conversation. I remember thinking: “What the fuck could these two possibly have to say to one another?” I sidled up to Alan later and said: “If Jason is bothering you, please let me know.” He said: “Jason Mewes could never bother me. He’s an American icon and an absolute true original.” It was beautiful to hear him say that.View image in fullscreen‘Kevin, it’s Alan, you’re taking me to lunch’ …Alanis Morissette, Alan Rickman and Kevin Smith on the set of Dogma.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockAfter the movie, we stayed in touch. Whenever I was in the UK, I’d get a call saying: “Kevin, it’s Alan. You’re in my country. I’m taking you to lunch.” And the same thing when he was in the US: “Kevin, it’s Alan. I’m in your country. You’re taking me to lunch.”When I played the O2, Alan and Rima came to the show and then drove back into town with me and my wife, Jen. Alan said he’d finally cracked and got an apartment in New York. I said: “That sounds great!” He said: “Maybe not, because it’s in the same building as my friend.” I said: “Even better!” He said: “Well, my friend is Ralph Fiennes, and if Harry Potter fans ever find out Voldemort and Snape live in the same building, they’ll burn it down.”After the Empire film awards one night, we all went out together with Matt Damon and his wife, Luciana. We had dinner and then about 1am took a picture together on London Bridge. I still have it on my laptop. It was a blissful time.I always thought Alan was nice and courteous and political. But after he died, it occurred to me he wasn’t just being professionally polite or British. He went out of his way to maintain a friendship. If he’d wanted, he never would have had to interact with me again. That a man as incredible as Alan chose to do so made me feel special. Very rarely do you meet somebody that exceptional. That guy, for whatever reason, liked me! I carry that as a badge of honour.‘He paid for the whole wrap party’Randall Millerand Jody SavinWe did not know Alan, but we knew he would be exquisite as the lead in our 2007 film, Nobel Son, about an egocentric professor whose son is kidnapped. So we made an offer to his US and UK agents. But when the Americans rejected our scale offer [for minimum pay], we thought that was the end of it. Two weeks later, we arrived home to a message on our answering machine from Alan himself. His UK agents had passed the script on to him, and he had read it.View image in fullscreen‘It was the best telephone message of our careers’ … Rickman at the Hollywood premiere of Nobel Son in 2008.Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/Reuters“Thank you for being real writers,” he said. It was the best telephone message of our careers. He thanked us for offering him the part but feared he had scheduling conflicts. So we overhauled our shooting schedule to make it work. And he was, of course, brilliant: always that actor who raised everyone’s game and challenged us all to be the best we could be.At the conclusion of the shoot, he asked about the wrap party. When we confessed we were completely out of funds, he wrote a cheque and paid for it himself. That was Alan – generous, inclusive and fun.We went on to make two more films with Alan: Bottle Shock in 2008 and CBGB in 2013. We shot Bottle Shock in Napa in the height of summer and Alan was stuffed into a three-piece wool suit and driving a tiny Gremlin with no air conditioning. He never complained. In the scene, the car gets a flat tyre. He gets out and yells “Knickers!” and kicks the wheel. But then he inadvertently slipped and did a Charlie Brown fall on his rump. Still in character, he popped right up and got on with the scene. The accident made the scene sing.View image in fullscreenRickman in Bottle Shock.Photograph: Freestyle Releasing/AllstarAlan was ill during the making of CBGB, but we never knew. He was our muse, a great friend and an exacting collaborator. He made us all better. He lives on in our hearts and films, and we miss him dearly.‘Alan became this ghost that had haunted my childhood’Neil JordanPeople said I wanted to cement Éamon de Valera’s status as a villain and so I cast the villain from Die Hard. I didn’t. I cast Alan Rickman in Michael Collins because he was one of the best actors of his generation. He was also tall, rather gaunt, had a prominent nose and looked remarkably like the taoiseach, Uachtarán, (President, Il Duce, Caudillo choose your translation) that seemed to dominate Irish life from the 1920s onward.View image in fullscreen‘Alan’s nose seemed to have expanded itself in imitation’ … Rickman in Michael Collins.Photograph: Maximum Film/AlamyBut nothing could have prepared me for my first encounter with Alan as De Valera, in a trailer (he had his own, rather small) behind the set of O’Connell Street we had built on the grounds of a disused institution. The General Post Office from which he would emerge in the film, bruised and battered but unbowed, was one 10th smaller than the original. He was listening to tapes of that voice I remembered from my childhood which every múinteoir (teacher) I ever had seemed to imitate. He was dressed in a long gaberdine coat with one of those high necked strangulation collars, the pair of wire-rimmed glasses that seemed to never leave the prominent bump on De Valera’s nose. Alan’s nose seemed to have expanded itself in imitation. He was clutching a copy of the actual Anglo-Irish Treaty which he was about to denunciate, in De Valera’s actual words. And there were 5,000 extras, waiting below for his entrance.Alan thought at the time I had arranged things this way to force the performance from him. I hadn’t. The schedule was so tight, the huge extras calls so complicated, it had to be that way. But I saw him walk out, mount the wooden podium behind the huge Irish flag and become this ghost that had haunted my childhood.“The volunteers would have to wade through Irish blood, through the blood of the soldiers of the Irish government and through, perhaps, the blood of some members of this government in order to get Irish freedom.”It was chilling. The wind whipped the enormous flag behind him. Five thousand people below, in cloth caps and borrowed shawls, roared in agreement. A civil war was the only answer.View image in fullscreen‘I began imagining a sequel’ … Rickman in the film with Liam Neeson and Aidan Quinn.Photograph: Maximum Film/AlamyThe voice, high and wheedling, was note perfect. I began imagining a sequel, that moment, on this extraordinary, contradictory figure. Alan Rickman head to head with Winston Churchill, who described these encounters as “trying to pick up mercury with a fork”. But historical epics don’t get sequels. De Valera, unlike Michael Collins, wouldn’t be sanctified by an early death. He would be burdened with guiding this republic, with all of its contradictions and failings, into the future.But Alan could have made every detail worth it.‘In hospital he wanted laughter and gossip’Frances BarberWhat can I say that everyone else that knew him hasn’t already eulogised? The most loving, generous man in the world, with such charm he made everyone weak at the knees. Such wit, such a sense of humour and kindness that surpassed anything I had ever witnessed before.View image in fullscreen‘He came to everything I ever did … with quite a lot of pithy notes after the shows’ … Frances Barber and Alan Rickman in 2004.Photograph: Alan Davidson/ShutterstockI first met him at the Bush theatre, upstairs in a tiny space above a pub in 1980. I had just left university and begun my first ever job at the same theatre. I’d never been there before and wanted to see what was in store. I’ll never forget that drawl that had everyone captivated and his famous presence. He had me at: “Hellllooooo, my name’s Alan Rickman, and who might you be?” I guess I fell in love with him on the spot and was in total awe. I remained in awe of him for his whole life.He and his devoted, wonderful partner Rima – who he idolised – came to everything I ever did. He had quite a lot of pithy notes after the shows, but always positive suggestions to help me be better. Alan always wanted everyone to be better, not because he thought he knew best, but because he loved his friends and wanted the best for them.View image in fullscreenWith Rima Horton, 2015.Photograph: Mark Sullivan/WireImageEven when he was so ill in hospital, he didn’t want to talk about himself; he wanted us to make him laugh and fill him in with the latest gossip. Life without Alan isn’t the same, but his memory will forever live on. I’m a very lucky woman to have had him in my life. And I still have Rima, and that means so much as they were always together.I imagine Alan is giving notes even now to whoever’s up there with him, in that famous voice, with that twinkle in his eye. I just loved him, simple as that.Explore more on these topicsFilmAlan RickmanRichard CurtisBrian CoxLindsay DuncanHarriet WalterHelena KennedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, like the proverbial London buses, here comes the same piece again (though this time calling itself The Makropulos Affair rather than the Royal Opera’s The Makropulos Case), with Simon Rattle leading two concert performances at the Barbican Hall.Rattle’s first-night account was simply sensational. He plunged at almost manic speed into Makropulos’s compellingly exciting prelude, and barely let up for the best part of two hours, as the opera played without an interval. The fierce tension may occasionally have come at the expense of some of the lighter touches that beguiled in Hrůša’s approach. Yet Janáček’s extraordinarily deft ear for orchestral detail and harmony – like the bassoon solo announcing the central character’s first appearance – was never sacrificed. The LSO played thrillingly.View image in fullscreen(l to r):Doubravka Novotná (Krista),  Marlis Petersen (Emilia Marty), Sir Simon Rattle, Aleš Briscein (Albert Gregor) and Svatopluk Sem (Baron Jaroslav Prus) with Simon Rattle and the London Symphony Orchestra in a concert performance of the Makropulos Affair.Photograph: Mark AllanTo succeed, this opera requires a commanding performance of the central role of the alchemically young diva Emilia Marty, originally born as Elina Makropulos in 1585. It got that from the German soprano Marlis Petersen. Marty is not an instantly sympathetic character, but Petersen found the emotional intelligence and vocal grandeur to make her final act transformation truly uplifting. Janáček’s writing for Marty is often cruelly exposed, but Petersen rose to every challenge. It was a performance fit to be bracketed with the most memorable Martys.It also helped that all the many minor characters were so sharply drawn. Having several of these roles taken by native Czechs brought instant authenticity and nice contrasts. If Aleš Briscein’s Albert Gregor and Vit Nosek’s Janek stood out, Jan Martiník’s Kolenaty, Svatopluk Sem’s Baron Prus and Doubravka Novotná’s Krista were in no way eclipsed. Peter Hoare was a lively Vitek, while Alan Oke effortlessly stole his scenes as the elderly Count Hauk-Šendorf.Tellingly, this concert version of Makropulos was able to pack more emotional impact and dramatic coherence thanKatie Mitchell’s scattergun stage productionin November. The story of a woman who has lived for 337 years, and finally embraces death rather than eternal life, emerged under Rattle as what Janáček surely thought it was: an intense and humane renunciation of the unattainable and tragic. A century on from the premiere in Brno, a work that was written in the shadow of first world war slaughter now felt frighteningly relevant to an era in which crazed autocrats such as Putin and megalomaniacs like Musk are seriously craving a version of the Makropulos alchemy to achieve their own immortality.Performance repeated atthe Barbican, London, on 15 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsLondon Symphony OrchestraClassical musicSimon RattlereviewsShareReuse this content"

The case is being investigated by the state medical examiner’s office, according to Slavin.A native of New York City, Forté was a musical prodigy who broke through in his early 20s as a contributor to the Fugees’ Grammy-winning The Score and to Wyclef Jean’s Grammy-nominated The Carnival. A multi-instrumentalist and rapper, he also released such solo albums as Poly Sci and I John, with contributors includingCarly Simon, whose son, Ben Taylor, was a close friend of Forté’s.His final album Vessels, Angels & Ancestors was released in 2021.In 2000, he was arrested at Newark international airport and charged with possession of liquid cocaine and drug trafficking. Forté was sentenced to 14 years in prison, but the sentence was commuted after seven years by president George W Bush. Simon was among many public figures who advocated for his release.“She’s my champion, my crusader, my mentor, my friend, my spiritual guru,” Forté once said of Simon. “She’s an awesome human being.”Writing for Vanity Fair in 2013, Simonreferredto him as her godson and called his punishment “hugely unfair”.Survivors include his wife, the photographer Lara Fuller, and two children.On Instagram, Jeanshareda video of them together and wrote: “This one hurts my brother @john_forte has joined the Angels legends never Die look at the smile R I P my Refugee brother.”Comedian and actor Amy Schumeralso paid tribute, calling him “prolific and beautiful” and sharing a link to a fundraiser helping his family.Fundraiser organizer Amber Knowles wrote that his death has left “a profound void in our community and in the hearts of everyone who knew and loved him”.Explore more on these topicsMusicFugeesCarly SimonnewsShareReuse this content"

Jamila Gavin was awarded the children’s fiction prize for My Soul, A Shining Tree.The Nero book awards, run by Caffè Nero, were launched in 2023 after Costa Coffeeabruptly ended its book awardsin June 2022. The prizes aim to point readers “of all ages and interests” towards the most outstanding books published in the UK and Ireland over the past year.The winners will now compete for the Nero Gold prize, for the overall book of the year, set to be announced in March. Each of the four winning authors receives £5,000, with the overall prize carrying a further £30,000.The judges called fiction winner Wood’s Seascraper an “utterly immersive read, steeped in atmosphere, that explores what constitutes a well-lived life”. Set on a fictional stretch of the Merseyside coast, the novel follows Thomas, a shrimp fisher living with his mother, whose routines are disrupted by the arrival of a charismatic American stranger promising opportunity.In hisreview for the Guardian, Jude Cook praised Wood’s “attentiveness to the prosaic details” of everyday life. “Whether it’s harnessing a horse, cooking a fry-up or tuning a guitar, he transforms the quotidian into the poetic, making the exactitude of each task sing on the page.”Nonfiction winner Sarah Perry’s Death of an Ordinary Man is a personal account of the death of her father-in-law after a cancer diagnosis. The judges praised the book as “honest, revealing and generous”, a memoir “rendered with precision and delicacy”, and concluded: “This is a book for everyone.”In aGuardian review, Joe Moran wrote: “What makes this book gem-like is that it succeeds in conveying the reality of death as this monumental, mythic thing that coexists surreally with the mundane world of council bin collections and neighbours hanging out their washing.”Claire Lynch won the debut fiction award for A Family Matter, a dual-timeline novel exploring the long-term effects of prejudice and secrecy on a family separated by homophobia in the 1980s. Judges described it as “a delicately written yet powerful story of injustice”, calling it “raw, vivid and ultimately hopeful”. In her review forthe Guardian, Joanna Cannon said: “In this small and powerful story, Lynch forces us to stare bigotry in the eye.”The children’s fiction prize went to Jamila Gavin for My Soul, A Shining Tree, a novel based on the true story of Indian first world war gunner Khudadad Khan, told from four perspectives, including that of a walnut tree. In the Guardian, Imogen Russell Williamsdescribed the bookas “a superbly poignant and evocative historical novel from a much-loved author”.The category prizes were judged by panels which featured Sinéad Gleeson, Paterson Joseph and Sharna Jackson among others.Shortlisted for the fiction award alongside Wood’s Seascraper were Cursed Daughters by Oyinkan Braithwaite, What We Can Know by Ian McEwan, and The Two Roberts by Damian Barr. For nonfiction, The Finest Hotel in Kabul by Lyse Doucet, Craftland by James Fox, and We Came By Sea by Horatio Clare were put forward alongside Death of an Ordinary Man.Shortlisted for the debut fiction prize with Lynch were The Expansion Project by Ben Pester, Lush by Rochelle Dowden-Lord, and Season by George Harrison. For the children’s prize, People Like Stars by Patrice Lawrence, Dragonborn by Struan Murray and Shrapnel Boys by Jenny Pearson joined Jamila Gavin on the shortlist.The four winners will now be considered for the Nero Gold prize by a final judging panel led by Nick Hornby, alongside broadcaster Reeta Chakrabarti and screenwriter and novelist Daisy Goodwin. The overall winner will be announced at a ceremony in March.Last year’sNero Gold prize winnerwas Guardian long read writer Sophie Elmhirst for Maurice and Maralyn, which won the nonfiction category. Lost in the Garden by Adam S Leslie won the fiction category; Wild Houses by Colin Barrett won the debut fiction category; and The Twelve by Liz Hyder, illustrated by Tom de Freston, won the children’s fiction category.

Except that when we want to go on a massive jolly/rehabilitative journey for ourselves and/or our careers, we have to pay for it. And we generally cannot go on a 100-day adventure across seven continents, with experts on hand to introduce us to their indigenous inhabitants, talk us through world-changing research being done in the most isolated regions on Earth, show us new and fascinating species that can be found there that may hold the cure to all known diseases, and guide us through the breathtaking landscapes that make you want to throw yourself to the ground and weep at the beauty laid out before humanity’s largely uncaring eyes.Not so for Willard Carroll Smith II, the Academy award, Bafta and Grammy-winning actor and rapper who enjoyed an uninterruptedly stellar career from the late 80s until 2022, when he put a crimp in things by lamping the Oscars’ host Chris Rock for insulting Smith’s wife. This was followed by a tour violinist suing him for alleged predatory behaviour, unlawful termination and retaliation, which is working its way through the California legal system now. Smith has categorically denied all allegations. He is getting away from it all in the meantime by doing all the adventuring noted above – a septet of episodes of Pole to Pole WithWill Smith(the name by which of course he is known to us) in honour of his late mentor Dr Allen Counter. Counter was a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School, the inaugural director of the university’s Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations and – in his spare time, I guess? – a noted explorer. I cannot help but feel a biopic must be in the works, and I hope it comes soon.View image in fullscreenHas all the sweeping grandeur you would expect … Will Smith takes part in a ceremony that signifies an old reef area that is closed until the fish return.Photograph: Freddie Claire/National GeographicBut back to Smith and his seven continents. The series is made by National Geographic and has all the visual polish and sweeping grandeur you would expect. It doesn’t rest on its star presenter laurels. Every moment looks gorgeous or is thrilling. The parts where Smith talks to camera are less enthralling – why does nobody ever provide a script for these things that at least attempts to match the standards reached elsewhere? – but out in the field, he’s a great companion: charismatic, funny (“They might be a little crazy,” he points out after the news that he is to visit three Brazilian climate scientists who have spent months alone in a tiny research station in west Antarctica. “And we need to be prepared for that. What’s our evacuation plan if they start tripping?”), honest in his awestruck reactions and apparently genuinely fascinated by his (genuinely fascinating) companions.View image in fullscreen‘There is not a hospital as far as I can see’ … Will Smith prepares to scale a massive, spindly tree.Photograph: Kyle Christy/National GeographicIn the three episodes available for review, they include the former Welsh rugby star and (current) polar athlete Richard Parks (who has to rein Smith in when he starts dancing on the ice sheet they are skiing across on their way to the south pole – “The environment doesn’t support life … there’s very little margin for error”), Heitor Evangelista (one of the Brazilian scientists, not “crazy”, but very clear that this is not the life for everyone) and the toxicologist Prof Bryan Fry. Fry takes Smith 60 metres (200ft) up a spindly looking tree in the Amazon rainforest to show him the spectacular view (“There is not a hospital as far as I can see,” says Smith) and then 60 metres below ground, on an expedition led by the Ecuadorian climber Carla Pérez, into caves populated by what are likely to be many new species, hidden from prying eyes and subject to unique evolutionary influences, and hoped to be the sources of new drugs and treatments for the many things that still ail us. “Give me a second,” says bug- and spider-hating Smith, as nameless little beasties skitter across the floor and up the walls, “to get my movie star face back.” In the next episode, Fry and Pérez take him anaconda-hunting. Smith hates snakes too. Attaboy.There are, inevitably, a few soul-bearing scenes but these are less godawful than they might be. Fry explains that he is motivated in part by survivor’s guilt after he emerged from a bout of meningitis “as lightly touched as you can be” (though he did have to relearn to walk because of muscle wastage, and was left permanently deaf in one ear) and Parks talks briefly and movingly about thinking “the worst thoughts” during the deepest depression he experienced after his rugby career was ended by sudden injury, and how discovering the desolate beauty of the polar regions helped him begin to recover. And Smith is an unexpectedly warm, attentive listener. It’s a lovely mix, and makes Pole to Pole a celebrity documentary that is an honourable exception to the usual dross that passes commissioning muster.Pole to Pole With Will Smith is on Disney+Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionWill SmithExplorationreviewsShareReuse this content"

Shenanigans will ensue!Lucy ManganWed 14 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Jan 2026 11.46 ESTShareDo you remember the lazy, hazy days of summer 2023, when Idris Elba got on a plane and it was hijacked? It was in a programme calledHijack. For seven effortlessly bingeable hours supposedly showing the adventure in real time, our man on the pressurised inside deduced complex situations from misplaced washbags, sent coded messages via fruit cartons and dying men’s phones, saved lives, averted disasters, and got Kingdom Flight 29 landed safely by Holly Aird so that he could return to his family, even though viewers agreed the scenes with them in between the plane bits were very boring indeed.And he wasn’t even a policeman like Bruce Willis in Die Hard or a counter-terrorist federal agent likeKiefer Sutherland in 24! Or a pilot, which might also have been useful. He was Sam Nelson, a business negotiator. He had extreme business negotiating skills and he beat the bad guys. Who turned out not to be terrorists but a crime syndicate that wanted to short shares in the airline. Which was a bit weird, but never mind. And one of the bad guys escaped, but the point is Sam was a hero and Elba was the only man who could have played him and made it work. He was a mighty, implacable force. The rock on which this fragile, teetering edifice of nonsense was built.Now SamIdris ElbaNelson is back. And this time, he’s on a train. An underground train, part of the Berlin metro, and let me tell you – shenanigans ensue. Sam is on his way to a meeting with a German government person. That gives us INITIAL TENSION, especially as we know Germans are efficient and don’t like to be kept waiting. It’s not xenophobia or stereotyping when it’s true.Just before Sam gets on the train, he notices a minor commotion being caused by a man sporting a red rucksack. Red for DANGER and HERRING so we must stay doubly alert. Sam is always alert because you never know when some business might need negotiating, but not I suspect aware of the herring part here because he doesn’t know he’s in a new series of Hijack.View image in fullscreenAnother rollicking ride … Elba in Hijack.Photograph: Kevin Baker/Apple TVAlso just before Sam gets on the train, he is accosted by young, enthusiastic employee Mei Tan (Jasmine Bayes) from his … business negotiation job? She is thrilled to have bumped into him and wants to talk. He tells her he has to get on at a carriage further up and walks away. I have never related to anyone so hard in my life. If I hadn’t already pledged allegiance to Sam Idris Elba Nelson, I would now.He gets on the train. So does Rucksack. So does Talker. So do assorted other plot devices – I mean actors – I mean ciphers – I mean characters. These are a bunch of mouthy students, one of whom is a claustrophobic called George (Paddy Holland), two harassed teachers, a Goth and her friend, some ordinary policeman (but will they be useful in any extraordinary circumstances that may or may not arise?), a mother with a crying baby, a creep pestering a woman who is a volunteer medic (but will she be useful in any extraordinary, possibly violent circumstances that may or may not arise?), and an increasingly nervous-looking driver called Otto. He is soon trying to call the man posing as a subway engineer (did I mention there was a man posing as a subway engineer?) and about to divert the train into an off-grid section of the network to try to get out of his part in whatever’s going on, but to no avail.View image in fullscreenAbove ground, we have other people! … Clare-Hope Ashitey and Toby Jones in Hijack season two.Photograph: Kevin Baker/Apple TVAbove ground we have other people. There is Marsha (Christine Adams), Sam’s wife, who is looking miserable in a cabin in the Highlands: I’m sure we shall be forced to find out why when the main characters need a rest from all the tension. There is Clara (Lisa Vicari), who works in the metro control room and has agreed to stay on for an extra hour to help out a friend (because “Nothing ever happens on the U5 anyway”, she honestly says, and here I absolutely take my hat off to everyone with even the minutest involvement in the creation of Hijack 2).Clara is starting to wonder if everything is OK with Otto, who keeps needing the loo and crashing through red lights. There is her manager, a metaphorically grey man who may or may not reveal heroic capacities in the face of extraordinary circumstances, should they arise. And the German government minister, who takes delivery of some photos from Sam’s contact that connect us back to season one, and there is still Toby Jones to come, as well as the return of Archie Panjabi, Max Beesley and others from the original outing.I can say no more without massive spoilers, but if you’ve tuned in for one minute, you’ll be there for them all. So enjoy, and I’ll see you again at the end of what promises to be another rollicking ride.Hijack is on Apple TVExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewIdris ElbaThrillersreviewsShareReuse this content"

McCurdy had also suffered sexual abuse, and claimed her mother had contributed to her developing an eating disorder. The memoir was a bestseller, walking readers through the realities of generational trauma; a step change for the former Disney child star who had been “the funny one” on obnoxious Nickelodeon kids’ shows.In her debut work of fiction, Half His Age, McCurdy continues to shake open a Pandora’s box, shedding light on blurred parent-child boundaries and loss of identity due to over-enmeshment, with solid one-liners that feel straight out of a sitcom writers’ room.Lead character Waldo is a high school senior whose life doesn’t seem to be her own. She play-acts through sexual encounters and disassociates at the school disco (“I stand off to the side watching, enveloped by a blanket of catatonia”). We soon find out that these reactions have been handed down from her chaotic mother. McCurdy writes the “Mom” as a comedic grand guignol, the damage she has writ on her child seeping out throughout the novel as though from invisible bullet wounds. Their relationship shifts uneasily between friends, siblings and caretaker (“I’ve been managing my mom’s emotions since I was five”). Waldo remembers Mom giving her advice on seduction when she was five (“the best way to keep a man is to be as pretty as you can be”), with tips from the tradwife school: to essentially morph into whoever your man wants you to be.McCurdy revs up to a final sex scene, which tone-shifts effortlessly from body horror to French farceWe see Waldo in scene after scene coming home to an empty house, her only company a sea of brightly coloured Post-It notes and instructions on how to reheat her next unsatisfying TV dinner. She copes via an online shopping addiction (“Tab tab tab tab. Cart cart cart cart. Desperate to chase away this heavy emptiness”) in which household items, junk food and useless fast fashion purchases become shorthand for the emotional wasteland she feels herself to be trapped in.Running on fumes, Waldo plunges headfirst into a pursuit of her married English teacher, Mr Korgy. McCurdy’s writing here is textured: Waldo’s observations are often savage but laced with humanity. Korgy is a complicated villain: a failed author turned teacher who grew up on World of Warcraft, loves Matchbox Twenty songs and is trapped in his own life. We wade about uncomfortably in the deep end of their uneven dynamic, from father-daughter to Henry Higgins and Eliza Doolittle. McCurdy writes gleefully about Waldo’s lust/disgust as she fantasises about licking his hairy paunch, and the desperate car-crash energy that buzzes between the two of them. Maybe this is a stand-in for her shopping and junk food addictions – or maybe she’s just bored.Obsession becomes tragicomic and crushingly mundane. The scenes of intimacy are a particular masterclass, McCurdy linking Waldo’s masochism with the illusion of control in the very uneven power dynamic. And when their relationship splutters in the harsh light of reality, McCurdy revs up to a final sex scene, which tone-shifts effortlessly from body horror to French farce. Half His Age is a bleak, often hilarious and uncomfortable triumph that underscores McCurdy’s talent for focusing in on the multilayered nature of trauma and artfully unpicking it, one scab at a time.Half His Age by Jennette McCurdy is published by 4th Estate (£16.99).

Kamilah Aisha Moon was due to read a poem at the ceremony, but no one had heard from her. Her phone was going straight to voicemail and staff at her hotel said she hadn’t checked in. “We’ll find her. She wouldn’t miss your wedding,” Griffiths’s sister, Melissa, assured her. But the next afternoon, in the middle of her wedding reception, Griffiths learned that Moon had died alone at home in Atlanta of unknown causes. On hearing the news she collapsed, hit her head on a table and blacked out. Paramedics pried open her eyes to shine a torch on them: “A particle of light that is so distant from the world I once knew.”For Griffiths, 47, the death of her best friend and “chosen sister” was one in a series of upheavals stretching across a decade. It began with the death of her mother, who was her greatest cheerleader and fiercest critic. She had instilled in her daughter the importance of “independence above everything. I was raised not to lose myself in the stories of others, especially men.”In 2017, Griffiths met and fell in love with Rushdie at a literary gathering, where he had collided with a plate-glass door that he thought was open, leaving him with a bloody head and a bruised ego. After that came the pandemic, during which two of Griffiths’s uncles died.But there was worse to come. Less than a year after Moon’s death, a stranger attempted to assassinate Rushdie. The author, who had a fatwa issued against him by Iran’s Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989, sustained near fatal stab wounds to his neck, chest, hand and eye. Rushdie would later write about the attack in his own book,Knife.Griffiths is a serious soul acutely attuned to the subtleties of human interactions and the chaos of her interior worldThe Flower Bearers reflects on these events and more in a narrative that hops back and forth across the decades. It is the first memoir by Griffiths, who has published five volumes of poetry and a novel, Promise. The book is simultaneously a love story, a portrait of sisterhood and a visceral depiction of violence, loss and emotional devastation. For Griffiths, the death of her friend and the attempted murder of her husband were “an uncanny Janus coin that [spun] around on the silent, bloodstained earth of my mind”.As one might expect from an author whose primary medium is poetry, the writing is evocative, full-bodied, perhaps a little overcooked in parts. Griffiths is a serious soul acutely attuned to the subtleties of human interactions and the chaos of her interior world. Though she skates over some troubling aspects of her story – there is passing mention of sexual violence and a serious suicide attempt in her early 20s – she is expansive and moving on her diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder. Griffiths’s struggles with the mental health condition led to her calling a suicide hotline in 2013. Unbeknown to her, the police were notified and dispatched to her Brooklyn apartment, where they demanded entry. Once in, they forced her to the floor and handcuffed her, ignoring her requests to walk with them to the waiting ambulance. “I hadn’t been arrested for any crime, yet my mental health episode had criminalised me,” she reflects.The Flower Bearers goes to some dark places, but there is joy, too, most notably in its portrait of Griffiths’s and Moon’s friendship, which brims with tenderness. The pair met in New York when they were graduate students studying creative writing in the mid-2000s, working multiple jobs and living hand-to-mouth. Their connection was cemented by music, poetry and the challenges of being Black women making their way in the world. Both felt “safe to share who we were, who we were becoming and what from our pasts was keeping us from claiming the promises of our futures”.In the final chapters, Griffiths embarks on a trip to the American south to honour Moon and the writers who inspired them both, and to confront the grief that threatens to overwhelm her. In doing so, she learns to accept loss as a part of living. “I know that life demands deaths, and births, each day. But it also insists on singing, dancing, suffering, surviving and loving. There is a last hour ahead of me somewhere, and it will be mine too, intimate as my first breath.”The Flower Bearers by Rachel Eliza Griffiths is published by John Murray (£22).

While the specifics of theAcademy Awardnominations are never known in advance, and can always be counted on for some surprises when they’re actually unveiled, critics and pundits and fans all enter into that final stretch with a pretty good idea of who won’t be nominated.One Battle After Another and Adolescence dominate 83rd Golden GlobesRead moreSome of this is because of the endless spitballing. But the “won’t” list is also easy to compile because it ultimately houses almost everyone who acted in a movie over the past year. Twenty performances are selected for theOscarsannually, and given the other high-profile awards bodies with additional preferences, category numbers and a never-complete overlap with the Academy, let’s say about 40 are in the broader competition of real possibilities. But there are so many more great performances every year than that, across all sizes, scopes and genres.They’re not all in equally great movies, and they don’t all fit into the Academy’s collective imagination of what constitutes the best work of any given year. Even as that organization has grown a bit more adventurous, there will always be individual performances that simply didn’t have much of a chance for any number of reasons: release date, box office, critical support, genre biases and so on. But it doesn’t have to be that way! It’s possible to buck the status quo, whether it’s as an awards voter looking beyond the most-hyped contenders, or simply as a viewer looking for something interesting to watch on a Friday night. So read this rundown of the year’s overlooked-by-awards performances, then, as suggestions for last-minute consideration from Academy members – or, more likely, recommendations from looking at great acting from some different angles before settling in for the usual annual horserace.Oona Chaplin,Avatar: Fire and AshView image in fullscreenPhotograph: 20th Century Studios/APHere’s a silver lining of the Academy’s longtime resistance to the idea of nominating a motion-capture performance: just think of how impossible it will ever be for some generative AI nonsense to make it to the virtual podium! In the meantime, though, it’s a shame that the nuances of performance capture have long been consigned to the visual effects category, rather than acting. Avatar mastermindJames Cameronhas tried to emphasize this distinction in some of his promotional material for Fire and Ash, the third installment of the series, and plenty of critics have rightly pointed out that last year’s best supporting actress Zoe Saldaña gives a more fleshed-out performance in these movies, where not so much as a centimeter of her actual real-life flesh is shown on screen. Now that Saldaña has her Oscar, we can at least mix things up and advocate for Oona Chaplin, who gives an intensely physical motion-capture performance as Varang, the complicated but unhinged baddie (in both senses of the word) from Avatar: Fire and Ash. As leader of the aggressive Mangkwan clan, Varang is both menacing and weirdly seductive, depending on the kind of charisma that can’t be summoned by a mere click of the mouse. Chaplin – yes, granddaughter of the legendary Charlie Chaplin – gives Varang a distinct personality through movement alone, with her battle-ready posture, confident strut and fiery snarls. Chaplin helps create one of the most captivating (and secretly lovable) villains of the year, and even through the digital makeup, you can see she’s having a blast doing it.Kirsten Dunst, RoofmanView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Photo Credit: Davi Russo/Paramount PicturesSo many acting honorees are (somewhat understandably) spotlighted for their high-difficulty virtuosity, whether imitating a real person, conveying superhuman degrees of suffering or disguising their familiar faces with transformative makeup. InRoofman, Kirsten Dunst doesn’t do any of that. More than just about anyone on this list, she’s more or less just playing a normal person: a Toys”R”Us employee, single mom and generally nice lady who falls in love with a charming guy (Channing Tatum) who’s secretly a fugitive from prison living in the store where she works. The movie is a showcase for Tatum, yet Dunst never plays as if she’s filling a thankless love-interest role; her struggles, disappointments and small-scale joys all radiate from her face without too much exposition walking us through it. In particular, the scene where she first decides to ask Tatum out on a date is a miniature masterpiece in making multiple emotions legible while maintaining a relative placid surface. It’s some of the best, truest, least fussy acting in a big-studio movie this year.Ralph Fiennes, 28 Years LaterView image in fullscreenPhotograph: FlixPix/AlamyHe looks like a deranged butcher, covered in dried blood, and his rumor-based reputation during the first hour-plus of28 Years Latermatches up with the ominous glimpses we get of his isolated form. But when Dr Ian Kelson (Ralph Fiennes) is eventually introduced, it turns out he’s a thoughtful, soft-spoken, sensitive man –and what looks like dried blood is actually just iodine, used to repel the infected zombies roaming the English countryside where he continues to make a home. Fiennes has plenty of experience playing unhinged villains, and doubtless could have been a memorable one in Danny Boyle’s long-gap zombie sequel. What he does instead in 28 Years Later, guiding young hero Spike (Alfie Williams) through the death of his cancer-stricken mother (Jodie Comer), is far more surprising and moving. Kelson doesn’t speak much about his own backstory; he exists mostly in the movie’s here and now, whether or not building a monument to the dead – infected and not – is tenable in the long term. Fiennes does the same in his performance, using his flawless sense of gentle authority to walk the audience through a horror-movie climax about accepting death, rather than fleeing in terror.Danielle Deadwyler, The Woman in the Yard, and Tatiana Maslany, KeeperView image in fullscreenComposite: Universal Pictures/ Neon/ AlamySpeaking of horror: with Frankenstein and Sinners both in play for multiple awards categories, the genre is poised to continue its surprising resurgence at the Oscars this year. But it still often takes an all-hands-on-deck super-production to break through a horror bias, and movies like Keeper and The Woman in the Yard are too thornily small-scale to garner that kind of mass acclaim. They both feature a psychologically tortured woman at the center, confined to a limited location and haunted by forces she doesn’t entirely understand. Maslany is a woman cautiously entering her second year in a romantic relationship, holding the screen as she starts to wonder whether she’s losing her mind. Oz Perkins’ movie purposely doesn’t give her a surfeit of specific history, and Maslany stays wonderfully focused in the moment. Deadwyler, on the other hand, has plenty of backstory to contend with as a woman near-paralyzed by grief following the death of her husband. At home with her two children, she’s confronted by a ghostly, veiled figure in the front yard, and as she attempts to figure out what it’s there for, Deadwyler gives a wrenching performance of just barely getting by. In high-risk material that could easily fall into bad-taste territory, Deadwyler keeps it unflinchingly honest.Dylan O’Brien, TwinlessView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Roadside Attractions/Everett/ShutterstockMichael B Jordanis expected to receive a much-deserved Oscar nomination for clearly delineating the pair of identical twins he plays inSinners. Dylan O’Brien’s double act in Twinless isn’t nearly so balanced; one twin, Rocky, has essentially just a single sequence, and we spend the rest of the movie in close proximity to Roman, who is racked with grief over his twin’s recent death. Even if we never saw Rocky, though, O’Brien would deserve attention for his turn as the rough-edged but sweet-natured Roman, who develops a friendship with a fellow member of a support group for people who have lost their twins. O’Brien has to play plenty of qualities that it would be easy to caricature; Roman is tough, emotionally confused and not exactly quick-witted. Yet the actor never succumbs to broadness, delivering writer-director-co-star James Sweeney’s dialogue with guileless, sometimes heartbreaking charm. When we do get that brief look at Rocky, it only confirms the fullness of O’Brien’s makeup-free transformation.Keanu Reeves, Good FortuneView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Eddy Chen/LionsgateIn the nearly 40 years since Keanu Reeves ascended to stardom playing half of a duo whose combined brainpower probably amounted to one dumb teenager in Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure, he’s more than proven his stealth versatility. (His action roles alone show more range than plenty of Oscar winners.) It’s another measure of his skill that he’s able to return to a bumbling dumb-guy role in Good Fortune and spin something completely different from it. Reeves has long possessed an otherworldly quality, and he flaunts it to comic ends as Gabriel, a low-level guardian angel reaching beyond his station. In executing his thin plan help a poor guy (Aziz Ansari) realize how good he has it by switching him with a rich guy (Seth Rogen), Gabriel clearly isn’t a top-tier celestial intellect. But Reeves never loses sight of Gabriel’s puppyish desire to help; he plays him more daft than dumb, which makes the performance even funnier as he embarks on his own fish-out-of-water journey. The way he innocently asks to tag along and crash with an impoverished Rogen is somehow both adorable and hilarious; the way he describes his eventual love for those around him in his newly humanized life is emotional without turning sappy. Reeves turns Gabriel’s failure into a state of grace.Jeffrey Wright, Highest 2 LowestView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Capital Pictures/AlamyWhat are the lines between sidekick, close confidante and employee? It’s a question some wealthy folks probably don’t ask themselves often enough, and while it’s not the central question ofSpike Lee’s Highest 2 Lowest, it’s an angle on the story that’s impossible to ignore every time Jeffrey Wright is on screen. Wright’s Paul Christopher is the longtime driver for music mogul David King (Denzel Washington), as well as an ex-con; their sons are best friends, which is how Paul’s kid winds up mistakenly taken by kidnappers looking to hold David’s kid for ransom. They ransom the wrong son anyway, sending David into a dilemma that has Paul questioning his place at David’s side. Wright is often well-cast as brainy types, as in his work for Wes Anderson (he was in The Phoenician Scheme earlier this year). He’s equally effective here as a man whose livelihood depends on a wealthy friend – and maybe on the increasingly difficult task of ignoring the many millions of dollars separating the two of them.Amanda Seyfried, pretty much everythingView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Daniel McFadden/APAmanda Seyfried’s work as the title Shaker inThe Testament of Ann Leeprobably counts as one of the aforementioned 40-or-so performances in the serious awards mix. Then again, she seems to be moving toward the outskirts of this year’s contenders, without recognition from the Sag’s actor awards or the Baftas. That alone would be a shame, because Seyfried is monumental in the role. Unmoored after giving birth to four children who die before age one, her Ann Lee possesses herself with purpose, devoting her life to an offshoot of Quakerism that forbids any sexual contact, even within marriage. It also features testimony in the form of vigorous hymns and accompanying dances, where Seyfried’s lovely voice turns in something at once ecstatic and desperate.But even if Seyfried does count as fully considered in Ann Lee, she offered two other terrific performances in 2025 for good measure. In the little-seen but worthwhile drama Seven Veils, she’s an opera director grappling with past abuses and a crumbling marriage. She looks perpetually moments away from screaming in frustration, though she mostly keeps that energy bottled up, roiling behind her signature saucer eyes. And in the much-seen, very silly but highly entertaining The Housemaid, she riffs on gothic gaslighting tropes, as well as superficial suburban-mom perfection, with movie-star glee as a woman who appears to be the unhinged boss from hell. Awards are obviously for specific performances, not a full year’s CV, but Seyfried’s trio of 2025 roles complement and accentuate each other so well that any one of them is worthy of recognition.This article was amended on 14 January 2026.

The film is a sadly forgotten 90s indie gem with great performances all around. Jared Harris’s Warhol is the definitive screen Warhol (sorry, David Bowie), and Stephen Dorff’s Candy Darling absolutely shines, but it’s Taylor’s performance that holds it all together. Pre-Sopranos Michael Imperioli and John Ventimiglia are also standouts in bit parts, playing completely against (future) type (imagine Christopher as a flighty Factory groupie). Available on YouTube, from what I see, though only at 480p.PazuzuSebastian Valmont– Dangerous LiaisonsI remember seeing the film in a London cinema when it was first released. When Valmont is killed during a duel, the sound of sobbing from the audience filled the cinema. Still gets me every time I watch the film.BustopherDirk Bogarde– The ServantMarvellously malevolent yet somehow cheap at the same time. All Joseph Losey’s collaborations with Harold Pinter are masterpieces.RoboxonJohn Hammond– Jurassic ParkHe’s an enthusiastic, grandfather-like character to the audience; however, his enthusiasm has blinded him to the unethical and dangerous work he’s done. Even when it goes wrong and his employees have been killed, he’s still deluded, in denial, and enthusiastic it’ll work and entertain people. The penny dropped too late.oaktowersHoward Ratner– Uncut GemsView image in fullscreenAdam Sandler in Uncut Gems.Photograph: APThe whole film is a study of destructive addiction, and the tension that exists in our sympathies for the afflicted.

There’s also a lot of quirky lo-fi special effects work with Airfix models.Bulk is a movie indebted to a mountain of pop culture references listed in Wheatley’s own handwriting in block capitals over the closing credits.Space: 1999is one – it is good to see it there, and see it reflected in the preceding film – and with the monochrome cinematography, Dutch angles and looming closeups there’s a bit of John Frankenheimer and a little of Chris Petit. The film is massively self-indulgent, often funny, rescued from its not infrequent longueurs by its stars, those very likable performers Alexandra Maria Lara and Sam Riley, who are a real-life married couple.Riley plays a tough-guy investigative journalist who is drugged and kidnapped by a snarling underling (Noah Taylor) and brought to a suburban house in Sussex, which appears to be the childhood home of the reclusive multibillionaire (Mark Monero) whom Riley is supposed to be writing an article about. He is an oligarch who has invented a “Brain Collider”, like the Large Hadron Collider only the size of someone’s front room and which is used for investigating the universal mysteries of consciousness.The house is a portal to the great intergalactic beyond or conceivably the infinite interior of the mind, through which Riley’s reporter is of course to tumble. He comes into contact with an elegant and charismatic woman (Lara) who may be his friend, his guide through the cosmic 3D madness, or his most dangerous enemy. You have to make friends with the jauntiness and zaniness of this film and to forgive its sometimes rather laborious quality, and Lara’s deadpan drollery is always watchable.Bulk is at the Nickel, London on 15 January, thentours.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsComedy filmsBen WheatleySam RileyComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is bafflingly complacent in its sentimentality and its sheer, fatuous implausibility, which makes it valueless and meaningless as drama and comedy.Fraser plays Phillip, a hapless unemployed actor from the US who a few years previously came to Tokyo to do a goofy TV ad for toothpaste and, having no friends or family back home, simply stayed on. He lucks into a weird new source of income: working for a “rental family”, based on firms inJapanwhich really do offer bespoke therapeutic role-play services, such as errant spouses, deceased loved ones or unsatisfactory co-workers – people who can be chatted with, or mourned, or yelled at for cathartic purposes.Phillip, who has issues of his own with a father who ran out on his family when he was a kid, finds himself having to be a dad to a little girl whose single mother needs a respectable father figure for an elite private school interview; the kid is told this is the guy who disappeared when she was a baby. And he is also to be effectively a mock son to an ageing actor, whose grownup daughter fears he is depressed; she hires Phillip as a phoney interviewer tasked with writing a flattering in-depth profile.In fact, Werner Herzog has already made a film on this subject,Family Romance, LLC from 2019, in which Herzog exerted himself to acknowledge, just a little, how bizarre, dysfunctional and fundamentally irresponsible the whole business is and how likely it is to make matters worse once the imposture is discovered.Yorgos Lanthimos’s surreal satire Alpsaddressed a similar theme. I found both these films uncertain, perhaps because there is something uncomfortable about adding a layer of role play to the existing play-acting of fictional films.But this one has a serious tonal problem, wanting to turn it all into feelgood slush with some vacuous platitudes about how we are all playing roles. (Not like this we aren’t.) Phillip has to impersonate a mock groom on a phoney wedding day for a young woman who wants to hide a certain truth from her parents, and there’s supposed comedy in the twist-reveal. It’s a reactionary patriarchal society, sure, but should this woman be lying to her old mum and dad like this? And if lying is the only way forward then shouldn’t the tone be something other than quirky farce?Then there’s the little girl whose heart he is apparently willing to risk breaking by pretending to her that he is her real dad. He is finally shown explaining and apologising to her – but not to the poor older actor. There is something fundamentally wrong-headed about this smug, saccharine film.Rental Family is in Australian cinemas now, and in UK and Irish cinemas from 16 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsBrendan FraserJapanAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not thoughtless per se; rather, it lacks the resources to bring its vision successfully to screen. Its quirks are sometimes appealing and sometimes amateurish and, while a mixture of influences swirl about, from Bond to Kingsman to Guy Ritchie and even Mission: Impossible, the film-makers don’t have the necessary budget, meaning that it feels at times like a TikTok parody of more expensive films.It is a shame, because there are some interesting visual ideas that go beyond route one filming. Example: a goon beating a man tied to a chair on a crispy manicured lawn is filmed in a lovely wide shot, with a guy in the far distance calmly clipping the hedge. But it’s the post-production that is the biggest letdown: the sound mix is poor, and it’s a real shame that the final image before the credits roll, which should be genuinely nasty, is derailed by risible FX.Lead actor Tony Cook endearingly saves anyone the bother of calling him the cheap version of Jason Statham by billing himself as exactly that in his social media bio – and that’s pretty much what he is. Second lead, Jonny Weldon, excellent in the Netflix adaptation of One Day, doesn’t have the material to work with here, but is an amiable presence. Some of the acting in lesser roles is not great though, contributing to tonal problems where it’s often hard to tell if a moment is intended as serious or comical. The bloopers at the end offer a bit of insight: everyone is having a wonderful time, making each other laugh and creasing up in ostensibly dramatic scenes. How are we supposed to take the serious bits seriously when it’s clear the people making it often found that impossible?A Gangster’s Life is on digital platforms from 19 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmCrime filmsThrillersreviewsShareReuse this content"

But does panto feel different once the Christmas holidays have ended and might it serve another purpose amid the January gloom?Nottingham Playhouse’sSleeping Beautyruns until this weekend, closing just before Blue Monday which is supposedly the most depressing day of the year. John Elkington is playing Nelly the Nanny in the show and has been Nottingham’s dame for almost 30 years. He says that for audiences who come in January, perhaps after being cooped up at home, “it’s something to look forward to” and one more treat after Christmas. “It feels like an extension for the children, keeping the fun up: you know, ‘there’s still the panto to go to!’ Our audiences are very loyal and supportive. Just because we’ve come into the new year and we do fewer shows – six a week rather than the 12 a week we do before Christmas – our job is to keep up the energy, not let it slip.” It’s a demanding gig – Elkington only gets to put his feet up on Christmas Day and New Year’s Day.About 40,000 people visit theNottingham Playhousepanto each year. Elkington says the audiences are “bigger and more animated” in the run-up to Christmas and that they do thin out afterwards. There are also more relaxed and access performances in January, designed for smaller audiences and adapted to be quieter. Throughout the run, Elkington approaches each show as if his whole family is in the front row.The riotous last night of the Nottingham panto, when the crew play tricks on the cast, has built up such a reputation that audiences who have already seen the show come back a second time. “They’ve seen it as it should be and then they come that night as well – anything can happen,” says Elkington, remembering the year there were 15 crew members and three of the band on stage and “an enormous pillow fight erupted”. Nottingham Playhouse is one of the few theatres to put its pantoonline– Sleeping Beauty, written and directed by Playhouse boss Adam Penford, is available on demand until Saturday night, when the final performance takes place.View image in fullscreen‘100% of everything’ … The Scouse Christmas Carol at the Royal Court in Liverpool.Photograph: AB PhotographyAt Liverpool’s Royal Court, The ScouseChristmasCarol was originally due to close this weekend but it has been so popular that it will now run until 24 January. It is not only one of the country’s last Christmas pantos to close but was one of the first to open, back on 7 November.“For most people, the panto is about leading up to Christmas,” says the theatre’s executive producer, Kevin Fearon, who is also the writer of the production, directed by Mark Chatterton. Many of those booking for January, Fearon says, will be coming because they were unable to secure seats for December. Audience demand is especially high for tickets for the stalls where you can be served a meal at your table before the show. This dining option is a popular feature at the Royal Court throughout the year. “People want to come out with their families and have a party, have a meal.”The panto is “our perfect show of the year”, he says, as it captures what the Royal Court is all about: “great entertainment with a great atmosphere in the room – 100% of everything”. In the cold of January, when the days are short and people are back at work, it’s a chance for a big night out to lift your spirits. The cost of living has led to some theatregoers reducing their trips to the Royal Court over the year but people remain committed to the panto, says Fearon. The audience often builds for the final weeks as word of mouth spreads. “We’ll take around £1.4m in ticket sales plus food and drink. That counts for more than half of our ticket sales for the year – it funds the rest of the year.” Within weeks of the panto closing, the team will have picked the title for the next show and started work on it. “People decide to bring more friends and family each year. We need to keep living up to previous years. There’s an expectation.”View image in fullscreen‘Its own tradition’ … Pinocchio and his Wooden Whopper at Brick Lane Music Hall.Photograph: Lucy Hayes PhotographyLike the Nottingham Playhouse panto, any references to Christmas are usually tweaked or taken out for the later performances of the Royal Court panto but that wasn’t an option with their mischievous take on A Christmas Carol. “It’s the first time we haven’t changed the last song of the show,” says Fearon. In Nottingham, the panto usually ends with a Christmas tune – during January this is swapped for a reprise of another number in the show.But some pantos aren’t designed for Christmas at all.Brick Lane Music Hallin east London is opening Jack and His Giant Stalk on 22 January and it runs until 7 March. Described as “a pantomime for grownups”, not as rude as the increasingly popularadult pantos, the show is written and directed by Lucy Hayes. It’s the second panto she has created for the venue after, ahem, Pinocchio and his Wooden Whopper.“We do a Christmas variety show with carols and all that jazz,” she says. “They used to do that for two weeks and then a panto for two weeks. But Christmas is the most popular time of the year so they were starting the Christmas show a week earlier, in November, and extending the panto for a week into January and they were selling and selling and selling. At least 10 years ago, they thought: what if we put the Christmas show on before Christmas and then the panto afterwards?”View image in fullscreen‘It’s very fun and silly and celebratory’ … Lucy Hayes.Photograph: East PhotographyIt has become, says Hayes, “its own tradition”. For many people, panto is about anticipating the holidays. What does a January-to-March pantomime offer? “Christmas is such a busy period, with seeing family and so on, people may have more time afterwards,” she says – and they may “need more cheering up, lifting out of the blues”. Their panto is “very fun and silly and celebratory – we go all-in on that”. Like the Royal Court, the venue serves food before the show – either an afternoon tea or a meal in the evening – and many of the audiences at the 180-seater have their own tradition of when they come during the run.Brick Lane Music Hall was founded in 1992 by her father, the performer Vincent Hayes, who she is now directing in the show. She remembers the joy of panto from her childhood: “I thought it was so exciting that as an audience member you could go up on stage. That blew my mind. I was always the brat who put their hand up, desperate to go on … I felt like it was for me because I was invited into it, which was different to the West End or a play.”There are companies that perform pantomimeat other times of the year, especially in Easter and half-term holidays. Even spooky ones are put on for Halloween. But Brick Lane Music Hall stands out for opening its panto right after most have just closed. “People are often surprised but they’re won over when you explain it to them – it is a fun idea,” says Hayes. It also means, of course, less competition for an audience than you’d find during the panto-stuffed month of December. “We’ve made our own market,” she says with a laugh.Sleeping Beautyis at Nottingham Playhouse and online until 17 January.The Scouse Christmas Carolis at the Royal Court, Liverpool, until 24 January.Jack and His Giant Stalkis at Brick Lane Music Hall, London, 22 January-7 March.Explore more on these topicsTheatrePanto seasonNottingham PlayhouseLiverpoolComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)ChristmasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Each piece is a consideration of in-between states, most outlandishly the standout, Interchange, a questing solo by Seirian Griffiths. In a particularly bureaucratic purgatory, the recently deceased Michael is informed, via a brisk yet personable voiceover from Sam Booth, that he has some excess baggage to process. The only way forward is to revisit the loves of his life, from his mother to fleeting relationships.The setup, with its slightly overdone pastiche of muzak-accompanied admin hell, prompts a dance of not quite exorcism but certainly cleansing as Michael spins through his past. The occasionally galloping pace suggests the near-death notion of events flashing before your eyes, as Griffiths makes graceful yet quicksilver transitions between contained bouts of torment that are strikingly well acted and boosted by his own coiled compositions. The hip-hop stylings are featherlight, too, when he pivots with a headstand or practically levitates, his shadow like a chalked outline below.It’s audaciously done while thoughtfully considering the weight we carry, although the holding bay scenario and voiceover strangely fall away. Like Michael, the piece has some of its own unfinished business.View image in fullscreenClubbers mobilise … Archive/Flesh/Echoes by Qi Song.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianThe transitional state in Chinese choreographer Qi Song’s rave-inspired Archive/Flesh/Echoes is the small hours. Sound designer Sanki supplies an ethereal, increasingly juddering score for a corps of clubbers who mobilise after sharing whispers and touches in an informal beginning. In thrall to the DJ, drawn to the golden allure of Sanli Lin Wang’s lighting, they are not so much lost in music as fiercely concentrating on it with as much focus as another intense scene in which they separately seek sexual climax. One clubber suggests the pain of keeping up with the beats, another is sent flying by them.Whether as an undulating throng or in isolation, the dancers capture the thread of an epic night out, its momentum waxing and waning, as if a force is created between them to ride until closing time. It is done with elan, although there is some generic clubby filler in the movement and it needs tightening to sear likeThe Butterfly Who Flew Into the Rave, a not dissimilar attempt at transcendence through techno.View image in fullscreenInventive skirt-ography … Isadora D’Héloïsa in Entrecuerpos.Photograph: Jemima YongIsadora D’Héloïsa is “between bodies” in Entrecuerpos and also between flamenco and voguing, styles she finds akin in their background of “marginalised histories and resistance”. Performing her own choreography – accompanied by Bryan Reyes (guitar), Ago Hernandez (percussion) and Carlos de Luisa (cante) – she moves from flamenco’s tempestuous footwork and yearning to the voguing crouch of a duck walk and general runway pizzazz.D’Héloïsa finds a commonality, including framings of the arms, though she more successfully isolates hands than legs, while the flamenco percussion accentuates the voguing angularity. The fusion never quite becomes more than the sum of its parts, but its joys include some inventive skirt-ography, her ruffles transforming into cape and camouflage for a piece alternating between sheer fabulousness and inner conflict.Resolution festival is atthe Place, London, until 25 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsDanceTheatreDance musicClubbingFlamencoreviewsShareReuse this content"

From my rocky perch atop Haystacks, I gazed down on Buttermere and Crummock Water glistening to the north, the round-shouldered hulks of Pillar and Great Gable looming to the south. A pair of ravens cronked indignantly, protesting against the intrusion on their eyrie; otherwise, stillness reigned.Bless you, Alfred Wainwright, I murmured, picturing the hiking legend whose ashes are scattered around this lonely tarn. And then, surprising myself: you too, Rishi Sunak. In very different ways, both had brought me to this most spectacular of Lakeland crags.Coast to Coast Wainwright walk map showing the routeIt’s a little over half a century since Wainwright, patron saint of fell walkers, sketched a line on the map linking the Cumbria and Yorkshire shores. Not, of course, at random.“The route follows an approximate beeline … from St Bees Head on the Irish Sea to Robin Hood’s Bay on the North Sea,” he wrote. “The grandest territory in the north of England is traversed by it; indeed, two-thirds of the route lies through the areas of three national parks.”Today Wainwright’sCoast to Coastpath is possibly Britain’s most popular multi-day trail, snaking more than 190 miles through the Lake District, Yorkshire Dales and North York Moors national parks. Curiously, though, it isn’t marked on OS Maps. Some stretches don’t even follow a public right of way. Yet.“Rishi Sunak, whose constituency encompasses the central part of the route, campaigned for its designation as a national trail,” explains Angela Hobson, Yorkshire Dales Coast to Coast project manager. “Previously there were issues with signposting, trail maintenance, even sections that didn’t have access formally agreed.”Crossing into the Dales, I ambled through fractured limestone pavement erupting through the turf like so many broken molarsNatural England, which administers national trails, announced the project in 2022, backed by £5.6m funding, to be completed “early 2026”. It involved a host of work – resolving legal issues of land access; upgrading and repairing paths, bridges and other infrastructure; improving signposting and waymarking with the distinctive acorn symbol; appointment of dedicated trail officers, and other aspects. But what practical difference will this status make – to walkers, to the environment, to local communities and businesses?To find out, I tackled the route – joined for some stretches by my partner Sarah – over 12 often exhilarating, sometimes exhausting days starting from St Bees, covering between 12 and 23 miles and bedding down in a different inn or B&B each night. The proof, after all, is in the plodding.View image in fullscreenThe writer on the route near Haystacks in the Lake District.Photograph: Sarah BaxterIt soon became clear that upgrades will probably be least palpable in the Lake District. Although some 6,000 tramp the route annually, contributing perhaps £7m to local economies, that’s a drop in the ocean for one of Britain’s most visited national parks, which welcomes close to 18 million visitors a year. Signposts are conspicuously absent on fell tops here, preserving the sense of wildness – and that looks unlikely to change. So the addition of green diamonds to the OS Map, indicating a waymarked route, will be a boon to those, like me, who are navigationally challenged. And there are other tangible infrastructure improvements.That became apparent on day one, as I descended the first real hill, Dent, down Raven Crag, where photogenically curly horned Herdwick sheep modelled obligingly. At the bottom I followed Nannycatch Beck, meandering through an elfin realm as magical as its name, beneath rowan and hawthorn, between sheer valley sides clad in bracken and coconut-scented gorse – and crossing pristine wooden footbridges to which subtle new Coast to Coast signs are affixed.The following day, I was grateful for repairs to trails around limpid Ennerdale Water and Honister Pass. Likewise in Wainwright’s favourite vale: “The Lake District is the loveliest part of England,” he proclaimed, “and Borrowdale is the fairest of its valleys.” Along the Derwent, here a babbling baby stream shaded by venerable oaks, the splendidly christened Willygrass Bridge has been renewed.View image in fullscreenEnnerdale Water in the Lake District.Photograph: Sarah BaxterCrossing into the Dales, I ambled through fractured limestone pavement erupting through the turf like so many broken molars. Once more, impacts of National Trail work were evident. “Many international guests have never experienced peat hag before,” notes Nick, who – with his partner Rachel – runs the fabulousOld Croft House B&Bin Kirkby Stephen, where I stayed, dishing up local lore, advice and slabs of luscious chocolate cake. “Sections of the path were so muddy, and saw so many walkers each year, that it became a quagmire 30 or 40 metres wide. Now old flagstones reclaimed from the region’s mills have been laid up to and across White Mossy Hill, making it accessible in pretty much all weathers. Some say they spoil the sense of wilderness, but they protect that fragile environment as well as making navigation easier.”Up towards the Brobdingnagian cairns on Nine Standards Rigg, I discovered a new long, snaking trail of heavy-duty stepping stones which protect precious peat and delicate moss ecosystems – and keep boots dry. Passing the route’s midway point, the postcard-pretty Swaledale village of Keld, and climbing on to the moor above Muker, past the ruins of gloriously named Crackpot Hall. Following the newly realigned path to the lead-mining relics around Swinner Gill and Gunnerside Gill, a concealed otherworld where the remains of pit buildings, channels and smelters only add to the enchantment.In this broadleaf Arcadia of mossy boulders and ferns, soaring cliffs, chiming birdsong and brook, I joined laughing families on stone pathsBeyond Richmond’s bulky castle (built by Alan the Red, my new favourite Norman), and fuelled by tea loaf topped with a wedge of creamy local wensleydale, I left the Dales to cross the flat agricultural Vale of Mowbray. Past Ingleby Cross, at the gateway to the North York Moors national park, the ascent through the silver birches and ferns of Scarth Wood is a welcome return to hillwalking, tracing the northern scarp of the Cleveland Hills. Improvements, from new National Trail signs to replacing stiles with gates, will benefit local people, not just long-distance hikers, North York Moors Coast to Coast project officer Bernie McLinden told me.View image in fullscreenPath improvements under way on White Mossy Hill.Photograph: Paul BloomfieldPerhaps the loveliest example came in Little Beck Wood on my final day, following May Beck to the waterfall of Falling Foss. In this broadleaf Arcadia of mossy boulders and ferns, soaring shale cliffs, chiming birdsong and melodious brook, I joined laughing families on stone paths laboriously laid by Bernie and volunteers, replacing slippery boardwalks. A few miles out from Robin Hood’s Bay and journey’s end, I recalled Angela’s words.“I took my daughter up to White Mossy Hill and said to her: ‘You’ll be able to walk over this with your children, and they’ll be able to walk over it with their grandchildren,’” she beamed. “‘And I helped build it.’” Wainwright’s legacy, refreshed.The trip was provided byMacs Adventure, which offers various Coast to Coast holidays, including a14-day itinerary (12 days’ walking) from £1,579including B&B accommodation, luggage transfers and route info.

I usually have them with a poached egg for protein or apple compote and soya yoghurt.Root vegetable and linseed latkesThis is a great way to use up any tired root vegetables lurking in the crisper drawer, and a recipe I come back to again and again. Latkes are a traditional Jewish potato cake that work really well made with other root vegetables as well. If I have a few different coloured vegetables, I will grate and mix the vegetables separately to make multicoloured latkes, but it’s much simpler to mix them all together.I used carrot leaves to decorate this dish. They’re beautiful but bitter, so use sparingly. Herbs are optional, of course, but if you want to add some colour, fresh flat-leaf parsley or coriander will freshen it up no end, too. And sauerkraut,which I made for last week’s column, is another wonderful traditional accompaniment to latkes, not least because its sour twang cuts through the rich fried flavour of the veg cakes.Serves2150g mixed root vegetables, grated (eg, beetroot, celeriac, turnip, etc)1 onion, peeled and gratedSea salt1 tbsp flour(wholegrain or plain), or 2 tbsp fine breadcrumbs1 tbsp wholegrain mustard(optional)2 tbsp ground linseeds1 tsp baking powderExtra-virgin olive oil, for fryingTo serve (all optional)Carrot leaves, or parsley leavesSauerkrautPoached eggsApple compote and yoghurtCombine the grated root vegetables and onion in a bowl with a good couple of pinches of sea salt and leave to sit for five minutes to draw out some of the excess moisture from the vegetables and ensure a nice, crisp end result. Pick up handfuls of the veg mixture, squeeze out all the excess liquid from each one as you go (save the liquid, because, mixed with extra-virgin olive oil, it makes a fabulous dressing), then put the squeezed vegetables in a clean bowl. Add the flour or breadcrumbs, optional mustard, linseed and baking powder, and mix well to combine.Put a little olive oil in a frying pan on a medium heat. Divide the vegetable mixture into four balls, lay them in the pan, then flatten the latkes slightly with a spatula and leave them well alone for three to five minutes, until they are golden on the underside. Carefully flip them over and cook for a few more minutes, until golden brown on the other side. Serve hot with your chosen toppings, or save and reheat later in the oven.Explore more on these topicsBreakfastWaste notFoodFood wasteVegetablesSnacksBrunchfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A couvert, comprising bread, butter, pickled or garlic carrots, cheese and fish paté (often sardine), comes as standard at every Portuguese restaurant and family dinner table alike, as it does atour restaurant Luso, where our fish paste is an ode to this way of dining. The mushroom tart, meanwhile, celebrates the Portuguese love of pastry and is a take on a traditional savoury tart. While such tarts are unlikely to feature solely mushrooms (they’re much more likely to be mixed vegetable tarts), we like to focus on the incredible varietals of this single ingredient.Smoked fish and vegetable paste (pictured top)A smooth, savoury blend of smoked fish and sweet vegetables that’s ideal as a spread, dip or toast topper. For a softer spread, stir a tablespoon of creme fraiche into the veg mix after blending.Prep25 minCook35 minMakes300gFor the fish paste300g undyed smoked haddock or cod fillet, skinless and boneless600ml whole milk1 bay leaf60ml olive oil(about 4 tbsp)½ brown onion(about 120g), peeled and chopped1 small carrot(about 120g), peeled and chopped½ small fennel bulb(about 100g), trimmed and chopped1 garlic clove, peeled and sliced½ tbsp pink peppercorns, or black peppercorns50ml white wine(optional)Sea salt and black pepperFor the chilli oil (optional)100ml rapeseed oil½ tsp chilli flakes1 small bay leafPut the smoked haddock, milk and bay leaf in a medium saucepan, bring to a gentle simmer, then leave to poach for six to eight minutes, until the fish flakes easily. Gently lift the fish out of the milk, leave it to cool slightly, then flake into small pieces; discard the milk and bay leaf.Next, cook the vegetables. In a frying pan, warm the olive oil on a medium heat, then add the onion, carrot, fennel, garlic and peppercorns, and cook gently, stirring, for 10 minutes, until soft and fragrant, but not browned. Stir in the white wine, if using, and leave it to bubble away until almost all the liquid evaporates.Tip the vegetable mixture into a blender or food processor, blitz until very smooth, then tip into a medium bowl. Fold in the flaked fish until it’s thoroughly combined, then season with sea salt and black pepper to taste. The paste will now keep for up to three days in a sealed container in the fridge.To make the optional chilli oil, warm the rapeseed oil in a small pan, take off the heat and stir in the chilli flakes and bay leaf. Leave to infuse for 15 minutes, then decant into a clean jar and seal (if you like, strain it first).To serve, spoon the fish paste into a bowl, drizzle over a little chilli oil to taste, if using, and serve with toast, crackers or crudités.Mushroom tartView image in fullscreenKimberley Hernandez’s mushroom tart.Prep20 minCook1 hr 10 minServes2For the mushroom caramel1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil1-1½ shallots, peeled and finely chopped (35g net)100g chestnut mushrooms, finely chopped (and add any of the trimmings from slicing the mushrooms below)2 tbsp light soy sauceFor the tart160g ready-rolled puff pastry(ie, ½ a regular 320g pack), cut in half into two rectanglesOlive oil80g king oyster mushrooms, cut into ½cm-thick slicesSea salt80g shiitake mushrooms, cut into ½cm-thick slices80g oyster mushrooms, cut into ½cm-thick slices80g chestnut mushrooms, or button mushrooms, cut into ½cm-thick slices70g maitake mushrooms, cut into ½cm-thick slices (if unavailable, use an extra 70g shiitake instead)First, make the caramel. Put the oil in a small pan on medium heat, add the chopped shallot and saute gently, stirring, for 10-12 minutes, until lightly caramelised. Add the chestnut mushrooms, cook for another 10 minutes, until soft and reduced, then stir in the soy sauce. Puree until smooth, then set aside.Now for the tart. Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Lay the two pastry rectangles on a large oven tray (or individual trays) lined with baking paper. Bake for three to five minutes, until the pastry is slightly puffed up and lightly golden, then remove and turn down the oven to 200C (180C)/390F/gas 6.Put a little olive oil in a medium frying pan on a high heat, then carefully fry the king oyster mushrooms, seasoned with a little sea salt, on both sides for a minute or two, until golden. Transfer to a small plate, then repeat one by one with each variety of the remaining mushrooms, keeping them all separate.Spread a thin layer of the mushroom caramel over each pastry base. Arrange the seared king oyster mushroom slices on top, then brush with another light layer of caramel. Repeat one by one with all the other mushrooms, adding a smear of caramel between each variety to help build flavour and structure, and finishing with the maitake (or extra shiitake) on top, again brushed with caramel. Return to the oven for eight to 10 minutes, until the pastry is golden and crisp. Serve hot or at room temperature with a crisp green salad.Kimberley Hernandez is head chef atLuso, London W1Explore more on these topicsFoodPortuguese food and drinkFishSeafoodVegetablesStarterMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"
