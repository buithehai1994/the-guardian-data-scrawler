He said he expected Ukraine to follow suit and said this would be a test of whether the “regime” in Kyiv was interested in peace.Putin made his remarks in a meeting with Russia’s commander-in-chief Valery Gerasimov, which was broadcast on state television. Ukrainians reacted sceptically, pointing out the announcement was made at the same time as an air raid alert sounded across the Kyiv region.Russia has broken numerous ceasefire since its 2014 covert invasion of eastern Ukraine. Unlike Ukraine, it has refused to implement a 30-day pause in fighting proposed more than a month ago by the Trump administration.Speaking on Saturday, Putin said Kyiv was guilty of violating a deal “100 times” to refrain from attacking Russian energy infrastructure. He commanded Gerasimov to prepare an “immediate response” if this were to happen again.“Russia has already declared and violated such ceasefires before,” Anton Gerashchenko, a blogger and former Ukrainian interior ministry adviser, wrote on social media.It came amid reports that the Trump administration is considering recognising Crimea as a Russian territory as part of its attempt to broker a peace deal between the two sides.According tosources cited by Bloomberg, the US may be willing to give Putin a strategic victory and to accept Russian control over the peninsula. In 2014, Russian special forces seized Crimea, which Putin annexed after a sham referendum.US diplomatic recognition would violate the UN charter and the post-1945 consensus that countries cannot seize territory by force. Most states, including the UK, have refused to recognise Russia’s illegal takeover.The possible concession to Moscow from the White House is likely to provoke criticism from the US’s one-time European allies and a furious backlash in Ukraine. It comes as Donald Trumpsaid on Friday the US may “move on” if no peace deal can be agreed.“Now if for some reason one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we’re just going to say you’re foolish. You are fools, you horrible people,” Trump declared, adding: “And we’re going to just take a pass. But, hopefully, we won’t have to do that.”Talks over a settlement are due to continue this week in London. Leaks suggest the US is pushing for a Kremlin-friendly agreement that would see Russia keep occupied areas in the south and east of Ukraine, as well as Crimea.It is also considering lifting sanctions on Moscow and other “carrots”, theNew York Post reported. By contrast, Trump has heaped pressure on Ukraine, in effect cutting off military assistance and demanding a share of thecountry’s lucrative mineral wealth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In talks with Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, Putin has insisted on Zelenskyy’s removal, Ukraine’s demilitarisation and its “neutral” non-Nato status.Ukraine appears willing to accept a freeze of the conflict along the existing 1,000km-long (620 miles) frontline. But Zelenskyy has categorically rejected Witkoff’s recent comment that Crimea and four other Ukrainian provinces should be given permanently to Russia.“I do not see any mandate for him [Witkoff] to speak about Ukrainian territories. These lands belong to our people, to our nation and to the future generations of Ukrainians,” Zelenskyy said last week.A peace deal will only work if the Russians stop fighting, US officials told Bloomberg. “Negotiations will be fruitless if the Kremlin does not agree to cease hostilities. Providing Ukraine with security guarantees is an integral part of any agreement,” one reportedly acknowledged.The source said no final decision over Crimea had been made. Since the US ceasefire proposal and ahead of Saturday’s “Easter truce”, Putin has stepped up attacks on Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure.Two people died on Friday when Russia fired three ballistic missiles into a residential district of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city. The attack followed a devastating strike on the city of Sumy on Palm Sunday, in which 35 people were killed, including two children.Russia has run Crimea for more than 11 years, transforming it from a holiday resort into a major military centre. It was used as a springboard for Putin’s full-scale 2022 invasion. Armoured columns seized large parts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces, as well as the city of Mariupol.Ukraine regularly targets Russian army and naval bases in Crimea. It hasbombed the headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea fleetin the port of Sevastopol, using British Storm Shadow missiles. It has also targeted the bridge linking the peninsula to Russiawith dronesanda car bomb.Separately, Russia and Ukraine both confirmed a swap of prisoners of war on Saturday, mediated by the UAE. Each released 246 prisoners, while a further 31 wounded Ukrainians were transferred in exchange for 15 injured Russian soldiers, the Russian defence ministry said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineThe ObserverRussiaEuropeDonald TrumpVladimir PutinShareReuse this content"

Americans abroad also signaled their opposition to the Trump agenda inDublin, Ireland, and other cities.More than 400 rallies were planned, most loosely organized by the group50501, which stands for 50 protests in 50 states, one movement.Opponents of Donald Trump’s administration mobilized from the east coast to the west, including at rallies inPortland, Maine, andPortland, Oregon, decrying what they see as threats to the nation’s democratic ideals.The demonstrations includeda massive marchthrough midtown Manhattan, a rally in front of the White House, and protestersholding up placardsreading “It’s Our Turn to Fight Tyranny” and “The Fascists Are Coming, The Fascists Are Coming” at a Concord, Massachusetts, commemoration of the start of the American revolutionary war 250 years ago.View image in fullscreenThe National Day of Action rally in downtown Miami, Florida, on Saturday.Photograph: Cristóbal Herrera/EPAView image in fullscreenThe protest in Miami on Saturday.Photograph: Lynne Sladky/APIn Massachusetts, 80-year-old retired mason Thomas Bassfordtold CBS Newsthat he believed US citizens were under attack from their own government, saying: “This is a very perilous time in America for liberty. Sometimes we have to fight for freedom.”Protesters identified a variety of concerns, each unified under a common theme: opposition to the second Trump presidency.“We are losing our country,” demonstrator Sara Harvey toldthe New York Timesin Jacksonville, Florida. “I’m worried for my grandchildren,” she said. “I do it for them.”It is the fourth protest event to be staged by the group since Trump was inaugurated on 20 January. Previous events included a “No Kings Day” on President’s Day, 17 February, a theme adopted beforeTrump referred to himself as a king in a social media postdays later.View image in fullscreenA human banner at Ocean Beach in San Francisco, California, on Saturday.Photograph: Stephen Lam/APOrganizers have called for 11 million people to participate in the latest rallies, representing 3.5% of the US population.Such a figure would likely surpass the numbers who took part in the “Hands Off” rallies staged on 5 April, when 1,200 demonstrations were staged across the US to register opposition to Trump’s assault on government agencies and institutions, spearheaded by the president’s chief lieutenant, the tech billionaireElon Musk, and his unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge) unit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It also said it was seeking to build momentum that would lead to further and larger protests.Heather Dunn, a spokesperson for 50501, said the goal of Saturday’s protests was “to protect our democracy against the rise of authoritarianism under the Trump administration”.She called the group a “pro-democracy, pro-constitution, anti-executive overreach, nonviolent grassroots movement” that was nonpartisan.View image in fullscreenA protest in Midtown in New York City on Saturday.Photograph: Sachyn Mital/Rex/ShutterstockView image in fullscreenNew York City on Saturday.Photograph: Sachyn Mital/Rex/Shutterstock“We have registered Democrats, registered independents and registered Republicans all marching because they all believe in America, because they all believe in a fair government that puts people before profits,” she toldthe Washington Post.Academics who have tracked the slide of democracy into authoritarianism say protests can be part of a wider of strategy to reverse the trend.“Oppositions to authoritarian governments have to use multiple channels always,” said Steven Levitsky, a political scientist at Harvard University and co-author, with Daniel Ziblatt, ofHow Democracies Die. “They have to use the courts where those are available. They have to use the ballot box when that’s available, and they have to use the streets when necessary – that can shape media framing and media discourse, which is very, very important.”In Washington DC on Saturday, a protest planned by the 50501 movement was scheduled to take place in Franklin Park, while other protesters, including a local chapter of Indivisible, rallied outside JD Vance’s home, on the grounds of the Washington Naval Observatory. Protesters also gathered near the Washington monument for a march in support ofKilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran man wrongly deported to El Salvador from Maryland.Explore more on these topicsUS newsTrump administrationUS politicsProtestWashington DCnewsShareReuse this content"

Thousands of trans and non-binary people thronged Parliament Square, alongside families and supporters waving baby blue, white and pink flags to demonstrate their anger at the judges’ ruling.The numbers seemed to take the organisers and police by surprise. Protesters from a hastily assembled coalition of 24 groups gathered in a ring against the barriers surrounding the grass and began speeches. But after the roads became clogged with people, a woman wearing a “Nobody knows I’m a lesbian” top ran across with her dog and soon the square was full. “It’s one hell of a turnout and there is a really strong sense of unity and solidarity,” said Jamie Strudwick, one of the organisers. “I think it’s impossible to compare it – it’s like nothing I’ve ever seen before.”Last Wednesday,the supreme court ruledthat when the Equality Act 2010 referred to women, it referred only to biological sex and did not include transgender women who hold a gender recognition certificate (GRC).The judgment was celebrated by groups including For Women Scotland, a gender-critical campaign groupbacked by JK Rowling, which says that women’s safety is threatened by allowing transgender women into single-sex spaces.In his judgment, Lord Hodge said that trans people were still protected from discrimination and harassment under the Equality Act. But some trans people say they have felt confusion, fear and anger, with many believing they will find it harder to challenge unfair treatment and receive support from authorities that should be helping them.View image in fullscreenMany protesters felt encouraged by the show of solidarity.Photograph: The ObserverAfter the ruling, the Equality and Human Rights Commission chair,Kishwer Falkner, said that it would create a new statutory code of practice by the summer, giving guidance to public bodies on how they should change their treatment of women and trans people. She said the NHS would need to change itsrules on single-sex wardsand her organisation would pursue the matter if it did not.Other organisations have already acted. British Transport Police said same-sex searches in custody would be conducted “in accordance with the biological birth sex of the detainee”.“In the last week, I’ve had to respond to four suicide attempts or threats from young people,” said Oscar Hoyle, who founded the Blossom LGBT community interest group in 2018. “The most significant one, I was on the phone for three hours to a transgender girl, 18 years old. It took three hours for police to come.” Blossom works with about 400 16 to 30-year-olds from across the LGBTQ community to support them into adulthood, and about two-thirds identify as trans or non-binary.“Regardless of where you sit in this conversation, nobody should be in a position where they feel like life isn’t worth living just because they fall within a marginalised group,” Hoyle said.Among the crowds outside parliament were Awsten Atkinson, a 23-year-old trans man and their partner, Daisy Watt, a 19-year-old trans woman. “My first reaction to the ruling was absolute horror,” Watt said. “I remember looking at the news and thinking, how on earth have we fallen this far? Not even 10 years ago we were making incredible progress but we just seemed to backslide so severely.”View image in fullscreenAwsten Atkinson, left, and Daisy Watt expressed horror and disbelief at the ruling.Photograph: Sonja Horsman/The ObserverAtkinson was “devastated and in disbelief”: “Why do people care so much about what we do with our lives when it doesn’t actually affect them? This is being framed as a feminist movement but the criteria they’re using to decide who is a woman brings the focus back to women as objects, as the sum of their body parts.”The couple were appalled by the BTP decision. “There are a lot of British transport police under investigation for sexual harassment as it is and this opens up the opportunity for them to say ‘you’re getting searched by a male because I believe you’re trans’ and they’re protected by law to do that,” Atkinson said.With protesters on the green, mostly under 30, waving flags and banners, Watt was “reassured that we have a community around us that is willing to stand up and speak truth to power”. Atkinson added: “As we were coming along, I started smiling and I said to them [Watt and her friends] ‘wow look at everybody’. What you can count on in this community is that people will rally round.”Near Mahatma Gandhi’s statue, two trans women in their 20s said they were worried that the UK was becoming more like the US.“When they instituted the bathroom bans there, you saw that it wasn’t just trans people, it was also cis people getting accused and being forced out,” one said.View image in fullscreenThe protest was hastily organised by 24 organisations.Photograph: The ObserverThe other said: “What I see is trans misogyny that women legally can’t be women, whereas men will always be men. I find it very scary.“In public spaces I have a different vibe. It’s like we’re going back in time. It feels like we’re not protected by the law any more.”Ann-Marie Still was there with her sister and niece. When she heard the news she was angry and disappointed in the system, she said. “I immediately reached out to trans friends, family, with a simple message: ‘you are loved, you are valid’.”“Most people disregard the young,” said Dani, who was there representing her trans sister. “Parents, children, elderly people – they can’t live their lives as they actually want to.”Police later launched an investigation after seven statues were daubed with graffiti, among them that of the suffragette Millicent Fawcett. Scotland Yard said its officers were in Parliament Square at the time, but did not witness the “criminal damage” take place. No arrests had been made, but officers were investigating, said Ch Supt Stuart Bell, leading the protest policing operation.Supreme court ruling on sex divides opinion | LettersRead morePolack said it would not change how she behaved. “I can go for an exercise and I go into the changing rooms and there’s nothing to hide because I look like every other woman that’s there.“There are one or two people I come across there who know my past and they’re quite happy with it and the rest of them don’t know and can’t tell. Why should it change? There’s no reason for it to change.”One of the things that bothers Polack is whether the ruling makes her gender recognition certificate valid or not. “There will probably be an attempt to restrict access to changing rooms and what they call single-sex spaces and enforce some sort of ban, but how do you police that?”Explore more on these topicsTransgenderThe ObserverGenderUK supreme courtEquality Act 2010LondonProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

They’re wrong: it will secure all our futuresToby HelmPolitical editorSat 19 Apr 2025 14.05 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Apr 2025 18.54 EDTShareEd Miliband has torn into Nigel Farage and the Tories for peddling dangerous “nonsense and lies” by suggesting the UK’s net zero target is responsible for destroying Britain’s businesses,including its steel industry.Cabinet ministers are determined to fight back against the way Reform UK and theConservativeshave unceremoniously lambasted the climate crisis agenda for what they believe are nakedly political reasons before important local elections next month.Both Farage and the Tories have blamed the perilous situation atBritish Steel’s Scunthorpe planton high energy costs, saying renewable energy prices have put the company on the brink.Reform has also used the crisis to call for the UK to become self-sufficient in oil and gas by drilling more in the North Sea, despite the fact that stocks there are dwindling fast and most of what is produced is exported.The total abandonment of the broad political consensus for net zero by parties on the right of UK politics – and by US president Donald Trump’s Republican administration in Washington – is causing serious alarm inside the UK government.Nigel Farage says Reform UK is ‘parking its tanks’ on Labour’s lawnRead moreBritain’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, is expected to “double down” on hisLabourgovernment’s commitment to a green energy future, and making the UK a clean energy superpower, at an International Energy Agency conference this week in London that will also be attended by pro-fossil-fuel officials from the Trump administration.In an article for theObserver, Miliband, the energy secretary, says the argument for the UK delivering clean power by 2030 is the same as it was when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022: the need to free ourselves from dependency on foreign supplies, including from Russia, which can lead to uncontrolled price spikes for customers in Britain.Referring to the soaring prices that shocked UK consumers in 2022 and that have continued to reverberate, he says: “Our exposure to fossil fuels meant that, as those markets went into meltdown and prices rocketed, family, business and public finances were devastated. The cost of living impacts caused back then still stalk families today.”As a result, Miliband says breaking free of dependence on overseas supplies is also a matter of “national security”.With an eye on thelocal and mayoral elections in England on 1 Mayin which Reform hopes to turn its recent national poll leads into council seats, Miliband says Farage’s party and the Tories “make up any old nonsense and lies to pursue their ideological agenda”.Polling experts believe the attacks on net zero could backfire on Reform and the Tories because the policy is overwhelmingly supported by the public.View image in fullscreenLuke Tryl, UK director of pollster More in Common, said Reform UK’s approach to the climate crisis could the party’s achilles heel.Photograph: SchoolsWeek websiteWhile Miliband has also been disparaged by the rightwing media over net zero, he is determined to fight back, not least because internal polling shows he and his policies remain popular within the Labour party.Luke Tryl, UK director of polling organisation More in Common, said: “There’s no doubt Reform have channelled public discontent with the status quo and a desire for change into electoral momentum since last July.“But their approach to climate change, along with stances on Ukraine and Farage’s relationship with Trump, risk becoming an achilles heel. Our research finds that in every UK constituency voters say they are more worried about climate change than not, and most see renewable energy as the path to energy security, jobs and cheaper energy.“Even Reform voters themselves, despite being less enamoured by the idea of net zero, just aren’t that motivated by it, and certainly not compared to an issue like immigration.”A Labour source said: “We will go after [Kemi] Badenoch and Farage on energy. They want to leave the UK exposed to markets controlled by [Vladimir] Putin – we are going to make the hard-nosed national security case for climate action.”View image in fullscreenReform UK leader Nigel Farage’s rhetoric that he party would reindustrialise Britain has been dismissed a ‘pure fantasy’ by climate groups.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAThis week Farage will tour 10 counties in England promoting his anti-net zero policy and also touting his newfound support for the outright nationalisation of the British steel industry – normally an approach advocated by politicians on the left.Miliband adds in hisObservercolumn that if the anti-net zero agenda were followed, it would not only risk “climate breakdown” but also “forfeit the clean energy jobs of the future” in this country, and with them a great opportunity for economic renewal.At a rally in Durham last week Farage said Reform would “reindustrialise Britain”, adding that this would require the country to start producing “enough of our own gas and oil and coal”. He said: “We should be self-sufficient in oil... We should be absolutely self-sufficient in gas.”Climate groups have, however, criticised this rhetoric as “pure fantasy”, pointing to official projections that show a steep decline in North Sea production, regardless of government policy and intervention, owing to the ageing nature of the sea’s basin.Far from being self-sufficient in gas, official forecasts show that the UK will be 94% reliant on gas imports by 2050 even if new fields were to be developed, only a fraction lower than if no new fields are developed (97% dependency).Labour has been making its own case for energy independence, focusing on Great BritishEnergy(GBE), which sources note is one of its most popular policies. The party will campaign heavily in the coming months on GBE’s policy of putting solar panels on the roofs of 200 schools and 200 hospitals.Tessa Khan, executive director of climate action group Uplift, said: “Nigel Farage is peddling a dangerous fantasy by suggesting that the UK can secure its energy from North Sea oil and gas.“As usual, he’s imitating Trump and his obsession with more drilling while ignoring that the UK’s remaining oil and gas reserves are dwindling fast after 60 years of extraction. That’s down to geology, not policies.”Khan added: “By trying to slow the shift to renewable energy, which the UK has in abundance but which Reform is opposed to, Farage is endangering the creation of new jobs that provide a more secure, long-term future.“The question for Reform is: what is its plan for the UK’s oil and gas workers, other than this dangerous fantasy?”Most of what is left in the North Sea is oil, about 80% of which is exported. The sea is also a high-cost basin to drill and more production is only possible if oil and gas prices are so high that energy bills become unaffordable for most ordinary people, or with more generous tax breaks for developers.Explore more on these topicsRenewable energyThe ObserverEnergyEd MilibandNigel FarageReform UKLabourConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

There was no indication he metPope Francis, who has resumed some official duties during his recovery from pneumonia.The Holy See has responded cautiously to theTrump administration, in keeping with its tradition of diplomatic neutrality.It has expressed alarm over Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigration and cuts in international aid, and has called for peaceful resolutions to the wars inUkraineand Gaza.US supreme court orders temporary halt to deportations of Venezuelan menRead moreThose concerns were reflected in theVaticanstatement, which said the talks were cordial and that the Vatican expressed satisfaction with the administration’s commitment to protecting freedom of religion and conscience.“There was an exchange of opinions on the international situation, especially regarding countries affected by war, political tensions and difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners,” the statement said.“Finally, hope was expressed for serene collaboration between the state and the Catholic church in the United States, whose valuable service to the most vulnerable people was acknowledged.”The reference to “serene collaboration” appeared to refer to Vance’s accusation that the US conference of Catholic bishops was resettling “illegal immigrants” in order to obtain federal funding. Top US cardinals have pushed back strongly against the claim.Parolin told La Repubblica on the eve of Vance’s visit: “It is clear that the approach of the current US administration is very different from what we are used to and, especially in the west, from what we have relied on for many years,.”As the US pushes to end the war in Ukraine, Parolin reaffirmed Kyiv’s right to its territorial integrity and insisted that any peace deal must not be “imposed” on Ukraine but “built patiently, day by day, with dialogue and mutual respect”.Vance was spending Easter weekend in Rome with his family and attended Good Friday services in St Peter’s Basilica after meeting Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni. On Saturday, after the Vance family’s introduction to Parolin, they had a private tour of the Sistine Chapel.It was not immediately clear where they would celebrate Easter. Pope Francis, for his part, according to official liturgical plans released on Saturday, indicated he hoped to attend Easter mass on Sunday, which usually draws thousands to St Peter’s Square.The pope and Vance have tangled over immigration and the Trump administration’s plans to deport people en masse. Francis has made caring for those who migrate a hallmark of his papacy and his progressive views on social justice issues have often put him at odds with members of the more conservative US Catholic church.The pope also changed church teaching to say that capital punishment was inadmissible in all cases. After a public appeal from Francis just weeks before Trump took office, Joe Biden commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row. Trump is an outspoken proponent of expanding capital punishment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They envision a counter-revolution in which they take over government bureaucracy and institutions such as universities from within, replacing entrenched “elites” with their own and acting upon their vision of the “common good”.Just days before the pope was admitted to hospital in February, Francis criticised the Trump administration’s deportation plans, warning that they would deprive people of their inherent dignity. In a letter to US bishops, he also appeared to respond to Vance directly for having claimed that Catholic doctrine justified such policies.Vance had defended the administration’s America-first crackdown by citing a concept from medieval Catholic theology known in Latin asordo amoris. He said the concept delineated a hierarchy of care – to family first, followed by neighbour, community, fellow citizens and, last, those elsewhere.In his 10 February letter, Francis appeared to correct Vance’s understanding of the concept.“Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extends to other persons and groups,” he wrote. “The trueordo amoristhat must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the good Samaritan, that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.”Vance has acknowledged Francis’ criticism but has said he will continue to defend his views. During an appearance on 28 February at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington, Vance did not address the issue specifically but called himself a “baby Catholic” and acknowledged there are “things about the faith that I don’t know”.Explore more on these topicsVaticanPope FrancisJD VanceUS immigrationUkraineCatholicismChristianitynewsShareReuse this content"

Her brother Thaeb Suliman, 23, was hospitalised in Ponticelli with severe injuries.The fourth person who died was the cable car operator, named locally as Carmine Parlato.Prosecutors in the Torre Annunziata region have opened an investigation into possible manslaughter charges after the crash about 28 miles (45km) south-east of Naples.MapA Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said: “We are supporting the families of a British couple who have died in Italy and are in touch with the local authorities.”The secondary school where Elaine Winn worked as a business manager paid tribute to her on Saturday.A spokesperson for Welland Park Academy in Market Harborough said: “Elaine was a much-loved and highly respected member of our school community. Her professionalism, warmth, and unwavering dedication to school life touched the lives of students, staff, and families alike.“She gave so much to the school beyond her role, and many students will have fond memories of her from the school trips she supported over the years. The care and kindness she showed to everyone in our community means her loss will be felt deeply by us all.”Italian media reported that one of the cables supporting the cabin had snapped. The cable car service, which had opened for the spring and summer season 10 days earlier, underwent a maintenance check a week ago, according to reports on Friday.“The cabin at the top has crashed,” Umberto De Gregorio, the chair of EAV, the public transport company that runs the cable car service, wrote on Facebook, calling it “a tragedy”.0:49Rescue footage shows aftermath of cable car crash in Italy – videoA British tourist witnessed the evacuation effort from the cable car that was left suspended in the air after the traction cable snapped.Megan Pacey, 50, from London, was with her husband, James Ross, and their children Hannah, 10, and Luke, eight, when they saw the car which had stopped in-mid air.She said: “We were within a minute or two of [the incident] happening.“They started winching people down from the cable car. We watched the first couple of people come down in a harness and as we left, there was a sense of urgency that had kicked in.”She said she saw flowers and candles on the steps outside the railway station on Friday and emergency services remained at the scene.Explore more on these topicsItalynewsShareReuse this content"

The sites were identified using a new PFAS risk screening tool developed by the Environment Agency (EA) designed to locate and prioritise pollution threats.RAF Marham and AAC Middle Wallop lie within drinking water safeguard zones. RM Chivenor borders protected shellfish waters, a special area of conservation, and the River Taw – an important salmon river.PFAS, orper- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of synthetic chemicals widely used in firefighting foams and industrial processes as well as in aconsumer products including waterproof fabrics, non-stick cookware, cosmetics and food packaging. They are known asforever chemicalsbecause they do not break down easily in the environment, and have been found polluting soil and water across the world. Some PFAS build up in the human body over time and have been linked to a range of serious health problems including cancers, immune system disruption and reproductive disorders.What are PFAS? Everything you need to know about the ‘forever chemicals’ surrounding us every dayRead moreMilitary bases with airfields have used firefighting foams laden with PFAS for decades. Certain chemicals in foams including PFOS, PFOA and PFHxS have been linked to diseases and banned, but they remain in the environment.Prof Hans Peter Arp, from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, said contamination at UK military sites would not be surprising. “Most, if not all, military bases in Europe and around the world have used vast quantities of firefighting foams that containPFAS,” he said. “They now have substantial PFAS concentrations in the soil and groundwater beneath them, as well as soaked into the concrete of their buildings.”He warned that PFAS pollution will continue for “decades to centuries” unless immediate local clean-up actions are taken. “These PFAS that are leaching now likely took several decades to get there. There are more PFAS to come.”View image in fullscreenRAF Puma helicopters above AAC Middle Wallop, Hampshire.Photograph: Neil Watkin/AlamyThis month the Environmental Audit Committee launched a formal inquiry into PFAS contamination and regulation across the UK. Campaigners and scientists warn that until the full scale of PFAS pollution is understood and addressed, the threat to human health and the environment will continue to grow.Alex Ford, professor of biology at the University of Portsmouth, said: “The EA has now identified thousands of high-risk sites around the UK with elevated concentrations of PFAS compounds. These forever chemicals are being detected in our soils, rivers, groundwater, our wildlife – and us.“It is very worrying to hear PFAS is being detected … close to drinking water sources. The quicker we get this large family of chemicals banned the better, as their legacy will outlive everybody alive today.”He added that the cost of cleaning up these pollutants could run into the billions – costs that, he argued, should be footed by the chemical industry.Not all water treatment works can remove PFAS, and upgrades would be costly. A spokesperson forWaterUK, which represents the water industry, said: “PFAS pollution is a huge global challenge. We want to see PFAS banned and the development of a national plan to remove it from the environment, which should be paid for by manufacturers.”Prof Crispin Halsall, an environmental chemist at Lancaster University, called for greater transparency and collaboration. “The MoD shouldn’t try to hide things. They should come clean and set up monitoring,” he said.The UK’s monitoring of PFAS is trailing behind the US, where contamination on military sites has been the focus of billions of dollars in federal spending on testing and clean-up operations.Are PFAS in everything? What you need to know about ‘forever chemicals’Read moreIn July, the US Environmental Protection Agency and US Army launched a joint project to sample private drinking-water wells near army installations. UK authorities only recently began to investigate the scale of the problem.Brad Creacey, a former US air force firefighter, spent decades training with firefighting foam on military bases across the US and Europe. During fire exercises, Creacey and his colleagues would ignite contaminated jet fuel and extinguish it with AFFF (aqueous film-forming foams) – often wearing old suits that were soaked and never cleaned. On one occasion he was doused in the foams for fun.Twenty years after he had stopped working with the foams, a blood test revealed that Creacey still had high PFOS levels in his blood. He has been diagnosed with thyroid cancer and now suffers from Hashimoto’s disease, high cholesterol and persistent fatigue.“We’ve taken on too much of a lackadaisical attitude about this contamination,” he said. “Unless this is taken seriously, we’re doomed.”Creacey is pursuing compensation through the US Department of Veterans Affairs and a separate lawsuitagainst 3Mand DuPont.Pete Thompson is a former Royal Air Force firefighter who served at several UK airbases including RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire. During his service he regularly used firefighting foams in training exercises and equipment tests, and said they usually sprayed them directly on to grass fields with no containment.“We used the foam in the back of what was called a TACR 1 – basically a Land Rover with a 450-litre tank of premixed foam on the back. Every six months we had to do a production test to prove that the system worked. That production test we just produced on to the grass … there was no way of stopping it going anywhere other than just draining in through the ground.”View image in fullscreenCalm waters at the mouth of the estuary where the River Taw meets the River Torridge in Chivenor, North Devon.Photograph: Terry Mathews/AlamyThe MoD is working with the EA to assess its sites, and work has begun to investigate whether to restrict PFAS in firefighting foams. Military sites are not the only sources of PFAS pollution – commercial airports, firefighting training grounds, manufacturers, landfills, paper mills and metal plating plants can also create contamination problems.An EA spokesperson said: “The global science on PFAS is evolving rapidly, and we are undertaking a multi-year programme to better understand sources of PFAS pollution in England. We have developed a risk screening approach to identify potential sources of PFAS pollution and prioritise the sites for further investigation. We have used this tool to assist the MoD in developing its programme of voluntary investigations and risk assessments.”Revealed: drinking water sources in England polluted with forever chemicalsRead moreA government spokesperson said: “There is no evidence that drinking water from our taps exceeds the safe levels of PFAS, as set out by the Drinking Water Inspectorate.“Our rapid review of the Environ­mental Improvement Plan will look at the risks posed by PFAS and how best to tackle them to deliver our legally binding targets to save nature.”The guidelines for 48 types of PFAS in drinking water is 0.1 micrograms per litre (100 nanograms per litre).Earlier this year,Watershed Investigationsuncovered MoD documents raising concerns that some RAF bases might behotspots of forever chemical pollution. In 2022, the Guardian reported that Duxford airfield – a former RAF base now owned by the Imperial War Museum – was probably the source ofPFOS-contaminated drinking waterin South Cambridgeshire. The site is now under investigation by the EA.Patrick Byrne, professor of water science at Liverpool John Moores University, said current monitoring efforts only scratch the surface. “We’re at the tip of the iceberg. We’re only monitoring a handful of PFAS compounds. There are many others we don’t yet fully understand or detect.“There are tests that measure the total PFAS load in water, and we’re finding huge discrepancies between those results and the levels of individual compounds. That tells us there’s a lot more PFAS in the environment than we know.”Even where testing is under way, labs are overwhelmed. “The Environment Agency’s lab is inundated. Private labs can’t keep up either,” he said. “Analytical technology is improving fast – but we’re racing to keep pace.”Explore more on these topicsPFASThe ObserverPollutionMinistry of DefenceFirefightersWaterRiversMilitarynewsShareReuse this content"

There have been some communication issues, personal and private on all sides, that needed to be dealt with, and these have been aired happily.“Roger [Daltrey] and I would like Zak to tighten up his latest evolved drumming style to accommodate our non-orchestral line up and he has readily agreed. I take responsibility for some of the confusion.“Our TCT shows at the Royal Albert Hall were a little tricky for me. I thought that four and a half weeks would be enough time to recover completely from having a complete knee replacement. (Why did I ever think I could land on my knees?) Wrong!“Maybe we didn’t put enough time into sound checks, giving us problems on stage. The sound in the centre of the stage is always the most difficult to work with. Roger did nothing wrong but fiddle with his in-ear monitors. Zak made a few mistakes and he has apologised. Albeit with a rubber duck drummer.”Starkey wrote on social media: “V grateful to be a part of The Who family Thanks Roger and Pete xx.”A reviewin the Metroof the gig at the Royal Albert Hall suggested that the band’s frontman Daltrey was complaining onstage about Starkey’s performance.It said Daltrey paused their final track, The Song is Over, and told the audience: “To sing that song I do need to hear the key, and I can’t. All I’ve got is drums going boom, boom, boom. I can’t sing to that. I’m sorry guys.”Starkey, the son of Beatles drummer Ringo Starr and Maureen Starkey, joined the band full-time during their 1996 Quadrophenia tour.He has also played with Oasis, Johnny Marr, the Lightning Seeds, Sly and Robbie, and his father.Explore more on these topicsThe WhoPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

No steam locomotive in the world had ever been run with in-cab digital signalling – until now.On a Monday night earlier this month, the new technology was ­trialled for the first time as part of a “pathfinder” project aimed at ­securing the future of steam locomotives in the UK.The “A1” No.60163 Tornado –Britain’s first steam locomotive to be built in 50 yearsand which has appeared in thePaddington 2movie and onTop Gear– has been ­fitted with European Train Control System (ETCS) technology as part of a Network Rail-led initiative which was launched in 2021. Fitting the new technology cost about £9m.View image in fullscreenThe Tornado crosses the Ribblehead viaduct in the Yorkshire Dales.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAETCS is to be rolled out across the country in the coming years and some trains will run in digital-only mode from the end of this year.It is already widely used in Europe and is seen as the industry standard ­signalling system for high-speed lines. Since 2011, the Cambrian Coast Line has been operated exclusively using the system as part of a different pilot programme.The Tornado ran west of Shrewsbury to Newtown and Welshpool overnight to trial the technology for the first time.“It is existential to the sector if steam cannot run with ETCS … the team have done a brilliant job of ­getting us to this point,” a Network Rail spokesperson involved in the project told theObserver. “The pathfinder [project] is all about saying ‘this is going to be really hard, is it ­technically viable?’ Nobody has ever done it with a heritage vehicle.”Since the privatisation of the railways, steam trains have been free to roam the national network subject to there being “white space” in the ­timetables around service trains.“We had quite a few challenges fitting the systems,” Rob Morland, electrical engineer at The A1 Steam Locomotive Trust, Tornado’s ­owning group, told theObserver. “This is a very harsh environment: we’ve got heat, coal, coal dust, shocks and vibrations and they all stress the systems.”A second steam-powered turbo generator, an axle-driven alternator and a dedicated battery bank had to be installed in order to power the equipment: “The cab was stripped back to bare metal because of the sheer number of new conduits, boxes and equipment and that was the only practical way to do it,” Morland added.Amy Clouston, principal human factors specialist at engineering consultancy AtkinsRéalis, which designed the fitment of the systems, said: “We had to test whether or not you can even use a touchscreen while you’re hurtling along at up to 75mph. We’ve had to think about vibrations, lighting, noise, coal dust, water and steam and grubby fingers.”Clouston said her team also had to factor in the placement of the screens to avoid being hit by a fireman ­swinging a shovel around, while still being in a position where the driver can still see the safety-critical ­information displayed.“Drivers have varied positions: some drivers hang out of the cab, ­others stand. It isn’t a ‘I’m sat at a desk’ design of a modern diesel or electric locomotive,” she said.Keeping the computers powering the systems cool also proved to be a headache: “The design team had the challenge of sealing them [against] coal dust and heat. Electronics in a sealed environment that’s already hot does not bode well [for the longevity],” she added.“Tornado’s retrofit with our ETCS is a world-first project that has tested our technology in one of the most complex and harsh ­operating environments, proving heritage and digital systems can coexist ­without compromise,” Tank Porteous, ­main line signalling programme director at Hitachi Rail UK, a partner in the project, said.Tornado is so far the only steam locomotive to have been fitted with the system. Last year Network Rail issued a £40m tender document for companies to bid to fit 24 main line steam and heritage diesel locomotives.“The price of future fitments will be significantly cheaper, there’s no doubt about that, but we don’t know yet exactly what that might be,” the NR spokesperson said.“We need to work out how ­commercially viable it is going to be. This is going to form part of where we go in the future.”The spokesperson told theObserverthe team have “learned more in the extremes with Tornado than we will do anywhere elsewhere” and the results will influence the design of equipment that will be fitted.AtkinsRéalis’s Clouston said the project was vital to the future of the main line steam sector: “Steam is part of the nation’s engineering ­heritage so it would be such a shame if it were to only be contained to ­private, ­heritage railways. Having steam ­locomotives out there on the main line is a ­wonderful thing to see.”Explore more on these topicsRail transportThe ObserverTransportEngineeringNetwork RailPaddington 2Top GearTravel & leisurenewsShareReuse this content"

It was a warm spring day. “I thought I’d sit with friends, have some tea. Birds were singing. The weather was beautiful. It was so nice,” she recalled.“The bus was packed. There wasn’t a single free seat. People were standing. Some were going to church for Palm Sunday. There were families with children.”As she reached the city centre she heard a loud bang. Two minutes later – as the bus made its way down Petropavlivska street – there was a second massive explosion. “The blast was in front of me, so I didn’t see it. I only heard it. I was sitting behind the driver, with my back to him. When I heard the noise, I covered my head with my hands and ducked.”After that, she said, “rocks, glass and everything went flying”. Shyrshonkova lifted her head. Blood was gushing “like a fountain” from her arm. “I saw cars on fire and smoke. People were lying at my feet. I said to them: ‘Get up, get up.’ They were silent.”A conductor called the name of the driver – “Kolya” – but there was no reply. Passengers tried to climb out of a window. Eventually, a teenage boy opened a door and she staggered out.View image in fullscreenMourners gather during the farewell ceremony for victims of the Palm Sunday attack.Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/APThe double strike on Sumy was thebloodiest single moment this year in Russia’s murderous war against Ukraine.

Thirty-five people were killed.Two of the victims buried last week were children, aged eleven and seven. Sumy residents left toys at the spot where they perished: a bear, a hippo, a toy car and a football.Shyrshonkova was one of 129 people wounded. Among them are 15 children. Some are critically injured, hovering “between life and death”, as Tetyana, a nurse at Sumy’s general hospital, told theObserver. The first missile crashed into a university congress centre, plunging through a glass atrium and a basement theatre. The second turned the city into a vision of hell, with bodies on the ground and a little girl crying and covered in blood.The war seems further away than ever from a peaceful resolution. On Friday, Donald Trumpsignalled he is ready to “take a pass”on brokering an agreement unless the two sides reach a deal “very shortly”.More than a month ago, Ukraine accepted a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire. Russia didn’t. Since then, it has demonstratively escalated its bombing campaign on civilians and infrastructure,hitting Sumy, Kharkiv and Dnipro.mapAs many predicted, Trump’s negotiating strategy has been to favourRussia. He has effectively ended military assistance to Kyiv, while falsely blaming Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Joe Biden for “starting” the war.No similar pressure has been applied to Moscow. Trump downplayed last weekend’s Sumy strike, calling it a “mistake”. His special envoy, Steve Witkoff – whomet European leaders on Thursday– parrots Kremlin disinformation.Speaking from hospital, survivors expressed anger at the US president, accusing him of laziness and a bewildering partisanship. “What happened in Sumy is terror, obviously – nothing else,” Shyrshonkova said. “Trump is basically supporting Russia now.“I wish he would come toUkraineand see what his belovedpuylo[a slang term for Putin, meaning prick] is doing. I want Trump to help us at the same level as Joe Biden.”Another wounded survivor, 72-year-old Hennadii Smoliarov, said the Russians were carrying out genocide. “They are trying to destroy all Ukrainians. They hate us. Putin says we are not a people.“They promote the concept ofRusskiy Miror ‘Russian World’. That means conquering everywhere.”Smoliarov said that, when he was studying in Moscow in the 1980s, he was called aKhokhol, a derogatory term for Ukrainians.“Prejudice is widespread,” he noted.He had been sitting on the 62 bus, having gone into town to fetch eyedrops for his wife, Anna. After the first strike the bus stopped outside Sumy state university’s institute of applied physics. Shrapnel from the second missile hit his lung and head. “There was a strong shockwave. You couldn’t see inside. The smoke was like a fog, it was so thick.”A woman lay motionless at his feet. “I lost strength and collapsed right inside the bus,” he recalled.View image in fullscreenHennadii Smoliarov, a survivor of the Sumy rocket attack, says Russia is ‘trying to destroy all Ukrainians’.Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The ObserverA volunteer grabbed Smoliarov by the collar of his brown leather jacket and dragged him on to the pavement.The explosion blew the wooden doors and glass from the 19th-century institute, sending shards into its garden and flowerbeds. A quartz wall clock on the ground floor stopped at the moment of impact: 10.20am and 40 seconds. Across the road, a giant hole was gouged in the white-painted economics and business faculty building.Another wounded survivor, Viktor Voitenko, said Sumy was in its fourth year of war. “We’ve had so many attacks, withShahed drones and missiles,” he said. “The air raids don’t stop.”The city, a key military hub, is located less than 20 miles from Russia. From here, Ukraine’s armed forces launcheda surprise mini-invasionlast August into Russia’s neighbouring Kursk region. Theywithdrew in March. Fighting continues in villages along the border, where Ukrainian troops hold a sliver of Russian territory.Voitenko works at the physics institute as a security guard. He was in the foyer when the second Iskander dropped. A metal fragment hit him in the spine. “I couldn’t feel my legs. I called my wife and she reached me in five minutes. After that, the police took me to a safe place,” he said.Lying in a hospital bed, Voitenko said it was unclear if he would walk again: “It’s in God’s hands. My operation went well. The doctors say they can’t guarantee anything.”Aged 56, Voitenko previously worked as a builder and as a “liquidator” – a member of the clean-up crew sent to the Chornobyl nuclear power station after the 1986 disaster.The Kremlin, he said, was addicted to reckless imperialism. “Before the war, we lived well. We had everything. I have a beautiful wife, an 11-year-old daughter and two cars.”The bus driver, Mykola Leon – killed on Palm Sunday, together with most of his passengers – was a distant relative, he said.‘It’s sheer terrorism’: Sumy buries dead after Russia’s Palm Sunday attackRead moreShyrshonkova spoke to theObserverfrom the neighbouring hospital room. She put her survival down to a class she attended in the 1950s as a schoolgirl in the Soviet Union.“We had civil defence lessons. The teachers told us capitalism was bad. They also explained what to do in the event of a nuclear attack. We were taught to keep our mouth closed and to cover our head and eyes.“When I heard the explosion on Sunday it came back to me. Some instinct took over,” she said.Once she left hospital, Shyrshonkova said she hoped to visit her dacha. “I’ve planted tomatoes and peppers on the balcony. I want to see them growing.”Luke Harding’sInvasion: Russia’s Bloody War and Ukraine’s Fight for Survival, shortlisted for theOrwellprize, is published by Guardian FaberExplore more on these topicsUkraineThe ObserverRussiaEuropeVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

But echoes of the blast, and its perpetrator, Timothy McVeigh, are heard today as far-right ideas storm the USAndrew GumbelSat 19 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Apr 2025 21.30 EDTShareThe world’s first reaction to the young military veteran and far-right radical who blew up a federal building inOklahoma City30 years ago this month was near-universal revulsion at the carnage he created and at the ideology that inspired it.A crowd yelled “baby killer” – and worse – as 26-year-oldTimothy McVeighwas led away in chains from a courthouse in rural Oklahoma where the FBI caught up with him two days after the bombing. He had the same crew cut he’d sported in his army days and stone cold eyes.An hour and a half’s drive to the south, 168 people lay dead, most of them office workers who had been providing government services, along with 19 young children in a day care centre directly above the spot where McVeigh parked his moving truck packed with ammonium nitrate and other explosives.The children were, most likely, his prime target.Bill Clinton, then president, rallied the country by vowing justice that would be “swift, certain and severe”. His attorney general wasted no time announcing she would seek the death penalty. Whatever flirtation the country had been entertaining withrightwing militia movementsin the wake of a national assault weapons ban that enraged gun rights activists, and controversies over the heavy-handedness of federal law enforcement, came screeching to a halt.Even elements of the radical right, McVeigh’s fellow travellers, were stunned by the sight of firefighters pulling dead babies out of the wreckage. Before the bombing, they had been full of heady talk of war against the government, but many of them imagined this would involve an attack on federal judges who had displeased the movement, or blowing up a building at night.“Didn’t he case the place?” one acquaintance of McVeigh’s asked incredulously. “The bastard has put the Patriot movement back 30 years,” lamented an erstwhile mentor of McVeigh’s from Arizona.View image in fullscreenOklahoma City federal building on 20 April 1995 as rescuers continued searching for bodies in the aftermath of the explosion.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesFast-forward those 30 years, and the movement is not only very much revived but has moved from the outer fringes of American politics to the very centre.McVeigh wanted to strike at what he saw as a corrupt, secretive cabal running the US government – what Donald Trump and his acolytes refer to as the Deep State and are now busy dismantling.McVeigh believed the US had no business extending its influence around the world or becoming entangled in foreign wars when white working-class Americans from industrial cities such as Buffalo, his home town, were suffering – an early expression of Trump’s America First ideology, which won him tens of millions of blue-collar votes last November.McVeigh’s favourite book, a white supremacist power fantasy calledThe Turner Diaries, blamed a cabal of Jews, black people and internationalists for perverting America’s true destiny – a sentiment now finding coded expression in Trump’s twin wars on immigration and on diversity, equity and inclusion.McVeigh believed it was up to ordinary citizens like him to take up arms and fight against a tyrannical ruling order, no matter the cost in innocent lives, because that was what the country’s founders had done during the American war of independence. The T-shirt he wore when he was arrested carried a quote from Thomas Jefferson: “The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.”View image in fullscreenSupporters of Donald Trump stand by the door to the Senate chamber in the US Capitol in Washington, DC, after breaching security on 6 January 2021.Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPADuring the Capitol riot on 6 January 2021, the QAnon-friendly Republican congresswomanLauren Boebertexpressed much the same sentiment as she cheered on the rioters smashing and bloodying their way past uniformed police officers into the halls of Congress. “Today is 1776,” shetweeted.The parallels have not been lost on political veterans of the 1990s. Clinton himself observed in a recentHBO documentary: “The words [McVeigh] used, the arguments he made, literally sound like the mainstream today. Like he won!”The threat the far right poses to the US government is no longer a physical one – not when it comes to the executive branch, anyway – since the radicals intent on cleaning house now have like-minded leaders such as Trump and Elon Musk doing it from the inside. It’s hard to imagine McVeigh, who was executed by lethal injection in 2001, objecting to the administration’s campaign to hollow out the international aid agency, kick career prosecutors and government watchdogs out of the Department of Justice, or vow to refashion “broken” institutions such as the FBI.“Their beliefs and values are allied,” said Janet Napolitano, who in 1995 played an administrative role in the bombing investigation as US attorney for Arizona and went on to run the Department of Homeland Security under President Obama. “It is a far cry to say that there are people in political power in the United States now who want to blow up federal buildings. We have to be very clear about that. But the notion that the country has somehow been stolen from them, that it’s run by elites, that they are trying to take away our guns – that has become a very accepted view among many.”Present and former members of the governing class still have reason to fear threats from the far right, either because they have been tagged as Deep State enemies by groups such as the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, or because they have been identified by President Trump as targets for “retribution”.Those threats, in the Trump era, have included afoiled plot to kidnapMichigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and ahammer attackon the husband of then House speaker Nancy Pelosi. In concert with the administration, activists sympathetic to Trump have engaged indoxxingand other forms of harassment at people deemed to be political enemies and their families, including whistleblowers, college campus protesters and former associates turned critics of the president.Seasoned national security experts like Napolitano fear it may not stop there, however, and worry particularly aboutjudgeswho have issued rulings hostile to administration interests. “Those far-right groups – they’ve all been given permission,” she said. “Pardoning all the January 6 defendants sends a terrible message about the rule of law in this country, just like purging from DoJ and the FBI sends a terrible message.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After bouncing from one dead-end job to another and racking up thousands in sports gambling debts, he hit the road in his Chevy Geo Spectrum to sell army surplus supplies and copies ofThe Turner Diariesat gun shows around the country. This was the very definition of a marginal existence.McVeigh was part of a cohort of so-called “angry young men” who felt the brunt of a downturn in manufacturing and defence contracting jobs at the end of the cold war and found their solace in guns, gun culture, and radical politics verging on the paranoid. Talk at the gun shows – which one violence prevention group memorably nicknamed “Tupperware partiesfor criminals” – obsessed over black helicopters and jack-booted government thugs. McVeigh himself told people the government had inserted a computer chip in his backside.Some of the movement’s loudest grievances were entirely genuine. McVeigh kept a list of raids that federal law enforcement agencies conducted in the name of theWar on Drugsand the innocent people caught up in them through error or inadvertence. He was appalled when the feds besieged a cabin in the Idaho mountains in October 1992, killing both the wife and the 14-year-old son of a survivalist who had refused to act as an informant on the far right. And he was appalled all over again the following spring by a secondbotched raidat a religious compound outside Waco, Texas, culminating in a deadly fire that killed more than 80 men, women and children.In Washington, these events were not generally viewed as indications of deep structural rot, but rather as operational screw-ups to be addressed through internal after-action reports and congressional review. McVeigh, though, was shocked by the sight of Bradley fighting vehicles moving in to force an end to the Waco siege, because he had driven Bradleys in the Gulf and, as a decorated military gunner, knew just how deadly they could be. Using them against civilians, including children, struck him as an abomination that cried out for revenge.Despite his later protestations to the contrary, compelling evidence suggests that McVeigh targeted the daycare centre as revenge for the children who died at Waco. The centre’s operator, Danielle Hunt, told the FBI she remembered McVeigh visiting four months before the bombing, pretending to be an active member of the military with his own young children. He asked a lot of strange questions about security, she recalled, looked at the windows and said, over and over, “There’s so much glass”.The FBI confirmed that McVeigh was indeed inOklahoma Cityat the time, along with his friend and fellow veteran Michael Fortier, who ended up cutting a deal with prosecutors in exchange for his testimony against McVeigh at trial.When agents first showed photographs of the dead children to Fortier, he showed no empathy for them, according to contemporary FBI records. Rather, he jumped out of his seat and exclaimed: “This is about Waco! Those parents did not kill their own children!”“These guys were just evil people,” said Kenneth Williams, one of the first FBI agents to question Fortier. To this day, Williams believes Fortier should have received a far harsher sentence than the 12 years he and the government agreed on.View image in fullscreenChildren at the scene of the Oklahoma City bombing.Photograph: David Longstreath/APLargely because of the children, the radical far right soon abandoned its dream of overthrowing the government by force. Even McVeigh, who had hoped to be seen as a hero and a martyr to the cause, came to wonder if he shouldn’t have opted for targeted killings of federal agents instead of indiscriminate slaughter.Much of the high emotion surrounding the bombing has been lost in the intervening decades. Outside of Oklahoma, few Americans under 30 know much, if anything, about it. In the age of Trump, that looks like a lost opportunity – for the country to understand the nature of the disillusionment and rage building for decades in “rust belt” cities and in farming communities across the heartland.Part of the reason for that lost opportunity is the US government’s failure at trial to tell the full story of who McVeigh was, the subculture he moved in, and the deep ideological wellsprings that led to his act of folly. For reasons largely dictated by courtroom expediency, prosecutors chose to depict McVeigh as a lone mastermind, with significant help from only one person, another fellow army veteran named Terry Nichols, who later confessed to helping McVeigh buy materials for the bomb and assemble it.“Two evil men did this, and two men paid,” the Oklahoma governor at the time of the bombing, Frank Keating, said when the trials were over. Yet few in government or on the prosecution team believed that everyone involved in the plot had been caught, or that those who had been identified necessarily received the punishment they deserved.“Some people got away with bloody murder, Fortier being one of them,” Williams, the former FBI agent, said.‘More than just a crime story’: the Oklahoma City bombing and a rise in domestic terrorismRead moreThe government dropped several promising lines of investigation – into a radical religious compound in eastern Oklahoma, into a neo-Nazi bank robbery gang, some of whose members later accused others of involvement in the bombing, and into Louis Beam, at the time the chief propagandist of the anti-government right, who was reported to have said in 1994 that “some kid” was going to blow up a building in Denver, Dallas, or Oklahoma City in revenge for Waco.The justice department’s fear was that following one or more of these leads and pointing to a wider conspiracy would weaken the case against McVeigh, when the directive from above was to obtain the death penalty at all costs. “At some point,” Napolitano acknowledged, “a strategic decision was made to focus and get a clean straightforward case against McVeigh, and not pursue every rabbit down its hole.”And so the wider story – of a heartland America desperate and cynical about its government, of a small but growing minority willing to embrace the notion that one day it might have to take up arms against tyranny in Washington – went largely untold. In 2025, we know at last how important that story was, and where it was destined to lead.Andrew Gumbel is the author of Oklahoma City: What The Investigation Missed – And Why It Still Matters (William Morrow, 2012)This article was amended on 19 April 2025.

Outside a closed graphic design shop overlooking them from a small hill, Solange Ndonga Tibesa tells the story of being uprooted from her homeland in north-westCameroon.In June 2019 she and other travellers were abducted with her three-month-old baby by secessionists, who accused them of supporting the military. Their captors repeatedly hit them with butts of their guns, keeping them in a forest without food or water.“We stayed in a forest there for two days. My baby cried [so much]... and we just became used to the mosquitoes,” said the 30-year-old. “One of the boys was asking me to take off my clothes but I begged: ‘It’s better if you just kill me than rape me,’ before the other boys intervened.”View image in fullscreenPaul Biya is seeking his eighth term as Cameroon’s president, a position he has held since 1982.Photograph: Charles Platiau/ReutersIn October, Cameroon goes to the polls, with 92-year-old Paul Biya, its president since 1982, running for an eighth term. An estimated 6.9 million people are registered to vote, but Tibesa, who fled into Cross River state in neighbouringNigeriaafter her release, is one of thousands who cannot vote even if they wanted to.The vast majority of Nigeria’s eastern flank is with Cameroon. The entire corridor is swallowed by two overlapping axes of migration due to conflict: in the upper half are mostly Nigerians fleeing jihadists such asBoko Haramand theIslamic West Africa Province; in the bottom half are Cameroonians fleeing a civil war in the English-speaking minority areas since 2017.About 107,000 refugees have come into Nigeria from Cameroon alone, according to figures from the UNHCR, the UN’s refugee agency.Approximately half of that number live in and around Adagom, Cross River state, where 63 hectares (156 acres) of land donated by the Nigerian government hosts open settlements. The UNHCR pays households in these communities a monthly stipend and teaches skills acquisitions.View image in fullscreenMany Cameroonian refugees have integrated into life in neighbouring Nigeria, but long to return to their homeland and the life they left behind.Photograph: Eromo Egbejule/The ObserverMany refugees have integrated with their Nigerian neighbours, some marrying each other, and passionately arguing about winning or losing bets on football matches. That similar dialects of pidgin English and Ejagham are spoken on both sides of the border has also helped. That has enabled many such as Tibesa to put trauma behind them to plough on.She is now working on being an all-rounder: she coaches a netball team, volunteers as a social worker and has taken classes in biofuel production and plastics recycling.Next to her, Tessy Ekpang, 29, who says soldiers killed two of her uncles, cannot wait to head to Kenya this month to begin studying pharmacy, courtesy of a fully funded scholarship.A five-minute drive away, an agricultural engineer named Edmund is fabricating solar power systems next to his fish pond with 3,000 fingerlings on a land sold to him by the Adagom community.The land that is now Cameroon was carved apart and patched together by European powers in the 19th and 20th century with little regard for its citizens or sense of national identity. A century ago, the entire country was the German colony of Kamerun.After the first world war, it was split between the British, which also administered neighbouring Nigeria, and the French. In a 1961 UN plebiscite, southern Cameroons voted to rejoin Cameroon, while northern Cameroons joined Nigeria.Now a predominantly Francophone nation, it has two anglophone regions in the west. For decades, anglophones complained of being treated as “second-class citizens”.When the military tried to quellpeaceful protestsabout appointments of French-speaking judges and teachers in the English-speaking minority areas in 2016, armed groups known as “Amba Boys” clashed with them and declared the breakaway republic ofAmbazonia.The impact on the civilian population has been massive: among other things, schools were closed as bridges were cut in two, disconnecting villages. More than 4,000 civilians have been killed and at least 712,000 displaced within and outside the country. “No single person is in my village again,” said Ekpang.Aid workers say half of the combined 4 million people in both regions are in need of humanitarian support, which could now be hampered bythe reshaping of foreign aid.In 2024, the US funded approximately half of UNHCR’s budget in Nigeria. “We are deeply concerned by the growing gap between needs and resources, and the massive impact [funding cuts] will have on millions of people displaced by war and persecution,” said Alpha Seydi Ba, a Dakar-based UNHCR representative.‘The fight is existential’: Cameroon’s anglophone leaders lead a revolution from behind barsRead moreMany say the conflict lingers because the government is unwilling to decentralise power or engage with the separatists, which it has described as terrorists. Many young men suspected of being separatists have been detained in prisons, according to Human Rights Watch.A national dialogue organised in 2019 by Biya’s government failed as key separatist movements were not included. Canada and Switzerland have also separately tried to mediate in the crisis but with little success.October’s election could, therefore, be crucial for any peace efforts. If Biya wins, as is widely expected, many expect business as usual. If his health keeps him from the ballot, it is rumoured that he and the party will appoint his 53-year-old son, Franck Biya, to run in his stead.Analysts say there must be a push for dialogue again regardless of the election’s outcome. “Cameroon’s international partners should press for inclusive dialogue to resume… [and] highlight the need to strengthen governance and expedite decentralisation so the anglophone regions benefit from the autonomy their ‘special status’ should have granted them,” said Hubert Kinkoh, a researcher with the Institute for Security Studies in Addis Ababa.For the refugees in Adagom, the clock is ticking and the losses rising.Tibesa would love to be able to return to Cameroon. “But when I see pictures of people that have been killed, I just burst out into tears because I really love my country,” she said. “But nobody is safe. If you run to the army, the Amba Boys will pursue you. If you run to the Amba Boys, the army will pursue you.”Explore more on these topicsCameroonThe ObserverNigeriaAfricaUnited NationsRefugeesHuman rightsAidnewsShareReuse this content"

I now live in a van. It’s common amongst third country kids: settling feels a hard thing to do. Our lives are peripatetic. Dad was a civil engineer and my early years were all over the place: Saudi Arabia, Papua New Guinea, Lesotho. Then I was sent to boarding school, where your dormitory changes every school year. You’re constantly shifting sands. My parents might move during term time; “home” then became a place I’d never visited.I think I was nine when I went, but I can’t be certain. Birthdays while boarding weren’t really celebrated, so it’s a blur. My older brother went off to Yorkshire and me to Cheshire. Yes, it was practical given my parents were often moving, but it was also very much an aspirational thing on my mother’s part. I’ve very little recollection of the earliest days. I know I flew over alone.That first school was a grand stately home with chandeliers. After being dropped off, I grabbed my bag and ran up the Elizabethan staircase. A booming voice shouted: “GET DOWN, NOW!” That’s how it remained. A lot of shouting and bells. Bells to wake up, bells to brush your teeth, bells to go down to breakfast… Very Pavlov’s dog.There wasn’t time for soft interpersonal skills, like negotiation. It was obey the rules, or be damned.Everything was geared up to strip you of your identity: uniforms for daytime, another for evening. We weren’t allowed to put posters on our wall. No toys, not even card games. We had no television or radio, and the food was revolting. Otherwise, there were activities: piano, elocution, deportment, and horse riding, once a week. During down time, we could either read or embroider.My first boarding school was ostensibly a finishing school. I was never destined to be a prim and proper young lady. I left at 13 and moved to a former all-boys school, which brought its own challenges. It was still children bringing up children for the most part.You’re told that you’re lucky and privileged to have been in the system. Indoctrinated into believing what you went through was good. I thought I was the only one who struggled well into adulthood. I became an alcoholic, and then entered recovery. I started attending meetings and realised how many others in the recovery programme had been to boarding school, too. As with a lot of ex-boarders, I struggled to build strong bonds with my parents. They snapped so early. We had little access to phones. I could go for months without speaking to them in my most formative years. I’ve not seen my father since I was in my early 20s. I stopped speaking to my mother before she died. As you get older, you subconsciously think: you didn’t look after me growing up, so why would I look after you now?Chris Braitch, 44, DorsetBoarded from the age of sevenView image in fullscreen‘It was a survival job’: Chris Braitch today and at school. He co-founded an organisation supporting pupil wellbeing.Photograph: Karen Robinson/The ObserverBoarding schools are a broad sector, not all are the elites of Eton. There are special educational needs schools, and residential institutions that specialise in dance, sports or music. Some cater for children from military, mercantile and missionary families. There are state boarding schools, and others for young people deemed to have behavioural problems.I boarded from 7 to 13. It wasn’t generational. Mine was a working-class family: mum was a teacher, dad an engineer. After their divorce, Mum remarried an ex-boarder. She saw his outward success and felt it would offer safety, stability and opportunity. I know it pained her when I went away, and Dad was against it. I can’t imagine doing the same to my children.Initially, I was excited. Then the doors close. It’s cold and you can’t sleep for all the crying. Minor transgressions from a long list of rules resulted in a beating or losing privileges. At seven, I was whacked with a trainer by a teacher for speaking after lights out. Pretty quickly, it became a survival job.View image in fullscreenChris Braitch at school.Photograph: Courtesy Chris BraitchIn my time boarding there were no incidents of sexual abuse, sadly plenty have those experiences. For me and many others, it was the abandonment, bullying and neglect, without being able to leave and rest, that left its mark. Psychotherapist Joy Schaverien identified the ABCD of Boarding School Syndrome: abandonment, bereavement, captivity and dissociation. Growing up in an institution without love, appropriate touch, surrounded by strangers – not all of whom are benign – sets you up for a life disconnected from your full emotional range. This is almost universal in my experience of speaking to hundreds of ex-boarders, whether they view their time at school as positive or not. I also see lots of self-medication. Booze or other addictions: workaholics; gambling; drugs; sex addiction. I’ve yet to meet an ex-boarder who has found stable and healthy adult relationships easy or who hasn’t self-sabotage another area of their life.These schools historically set out to cauterise emotions and to break the child, to then shape the child. They were designed to create soldiers for an empire that no longer exists; the battle-ready now left to navigate the complexities of modern life. I tried to channel myself into a 20-year corporate career punctuated with alcohol as a coping strategy. At times I was ambitious, unforgiving, and self-aggrandising.As part of my healing and development following a breakdown, I co-founded an organisation, Seen and Heard (seenheard.org.uk), which supports the wellbeing of pupils past and present. We run free online support groups, have a directory of mental health professionals and offer grants for support. We campaign for improvements to child sexual-abuse legislation and lobby schools to improve welfare provision, so the next generation don’t come out of the system as damaged as mine.Generally, the schools are safer than they used to be and the majority of staff are doing their best. But the inconvenient truth that none will confront is this: in the vast majority of cases, children simply aren’t better growing up away from their family. If it’s safe for a child to be at home, that’s where they should be.Lydia Lockhart, 33, OxfordshireBoarded from the age of sevenView image in fullscreen‘I blamed myself for not being good enough’: Lydia Lockhart.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The ObserverMost of my life I have blamed myself for not being good enough or capable. When I found out about others with Boarding School Syndrome, I became angry at my parents. Now I see they were doing what they thought was best for me. That doesn’t mean it wasn’t wrong.I started boarding a couple of nights a week; I wanted to because my brother was already. I really enjoyed the first years at my small prep school. Those few sleeps away from home felt like a thrill. My dad had boarded from the age of 9 to 11, before transferring. Mum had, been too, and ended up being expelled from her first school – she ran away from the second. But in our family and circle, it was the done thing; the best thing, supposedly, to do for your child.Aged 11, boarding full-time, I started to struggle. Homesickness, initially. We were only allowed to call home for 10 minutes, twice weekly. It was a public payphone: kids would press up against the glass as you spoke, waiting for their turn. There was no way to communicate with your parents that felt private or safe. Whenever I was upset, a staff member encouraged me into an activity; a distraction. The message enforced is simple: getting emotional won’t help, so don’t.We didn’t go home at weekends. Mum would send me letters – “The dogs are curled up by the fire” – and I’d be thinking, why thefuckaren’t I? Sundays were for visits, but parents rarely came. Mine only lived 45 minutes away, but it all felt too painful. The pupils had privilege, but we were imprisoned, in a way.In adulthood, I’ve been diagnosed with autism and ADHD. It wasn’t picked up at school, as was common then, especially in girls. Now I work in London, supporting kids with special educational needs. Boarding schools, I am certain, aren’t a place for these young people. Those children need one-to-one attention from parents or carers. After school hours there might be only two adults to 80 or more kids. Children need to let loose after classes. At boarding school, the mask has to remain on permanently.I developed anorexia in my second or third year there. It was something I could control, in a place where I felt I had no grip or agency. Despite being under the school’s care, they didn’t notice. My parents did, after watching me play sports. I was taken aside by a teacher and told to eat more potatoes. I was hospitalised, then sent back to board for sixth form.You lose yourself inside these places. I was an opinionated little girl when I arrived, with passions and hobbies. I’d lost much of that by the time I left. I was taught to follow orders and comply. You’re left institutionalised. At university, other students thrived with their newfound freedom. Without an hour-to-hour timetable, I was adrift.Piers Cross, 49, YorkshireBoarded from the age of 11View image in fullscreen‘On the surface it was a success’: Piers Cross now coaches ex-boarders.Photograph: Shaw and Shaw/The ObserverI started reading biographies of some of the most well-known, successful and celebrated leaders of this country. Many went to boarding school and had horrific times. I wanted to explore how and why the people in power had been traumatised, and the effect that might be having on the rest of the world. It felt like an elephant in the room.Take David Cameron. He described being sent to boarding school at seven as “brutal and bizarre” and recalled “frequent beatings”. He lost a stone in weight during a single term. Tony Blair tried to run away aged 14, making his way to Newcastle airport in a bid to escape. There are so many of these stories. Charles Spencer made a huge impact when he wrote of his horrendous time. Last month, Winston’s Churchill’s grandson spoke out.Today, I’m a coach, working mostly with ex-boarders in positions of power: CEOs and the like. I’ve got my own story, too. My family were military officers. Most had boarded. I did from 11 until 18. On the surface, I was a real success story: I left as captain of athletics, in the first teams for rugby and football.Later, while working in the city in London, I had a breakdown. I started to realise how horrific it had been. I’d been sexually abused as a teenager by a staff member. In the end, this teacher was imprisoned for 12 years, having abused nine pupils. One teacher is still in prison and there’s another who has spent time inside. The consequences have followed me around for years. We idealise boarding schools in this country: Hogwarts, Enid Blyton, evenWicked. We’ve had it for generations. Yes, you can achieve good A-level results. But that’s not all that makes an education.A group of us decided to make a documentary,Boarding on Insanity. It started with interviews. First, Nick Duffell, author ofWounded Leaders: British Elitism and the Entitlement Illusion. We started to piece together how this trauma informs our politics and wider society, given so many end up at the top. As Nick pointed out: if you learn to hate the vulnerable within yourself, as you do in these schools, you’re going to struggle to empathise with the vulnerable in society.Alongside interviews with experts, the film hears from ex-boarders. A group of us of different ages and backgrounds got together for a weekend retreat. It created a space to open up and share, the opposite of what boarding school instils in you. The first time I cried at boarding school, aged 11, all the boys in my dorm shouted: “Weak! Weak! Weak!” I learned to never show my emotions. I didn’t even cry when my father died.Being part of a group connecting to their stories was transformational. I felt myself open up. Sharing that pain and grief helps you let it go. Telling these stories is how we heal.Dan Perry, 47, LondonBoarded from the age of 14View image in fullscreen‘I had no chance to find my people’: Daniel Perry.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The ObserverOne of mum’s side hustles was as an educational consultant – she helped place expat kids into suitable schools. I was born in London, but we moved to Spain when I was eight. I’d been windsurfing down on the beach, then came back up at lunchtime. Mum asked if I fancied going to a boarding school in York. Thinking little of it, I said yes, then went back down to the ocean. A few weeks later, I was there. Windsurfing had been my passion, but I never really did it again after that day. That’s the thing about boarding schools – they put an end to your individuality.I was shown around the boarding house by another boy. I don’t remember my mother leaving. There was no anguish there. In my early teens, I spent my summers teaching water sports in Scotland, and would travel to different countries alone. I valued my independence. I was excited to get away. The culture shock was huge. I was nervous trying to clumsily understand the way things worked. There was a state school in the grounds of our palatial establishment. The kids at my school would throw stones at those children as they made their way past.Anyone who was different got picked on: fat, small, Black, gay, anything. It happens all over, but being a public school – a boarding school – that was more pronounced. These weren’t exactly environments that cultivated or celebrated diversity. Until that school, I’d never even considered my race.It was rarely aggressive and violent. Often, it was invisible. And there was no break or reprieve; no time to find comfort from family or community beyond the gates who understood what I was going through. I couldn’t make friends outside school – I had no chance to find my people. I was totally disconnected and alone.So when I found the tape, I felt numb. I’d recorded music onto a tape in the common room. The following year, I finally listened to it, while recovering from a broken collar bone. Midway through, the music cut out, to the sound of boys from my school hurling racist abuse. These were people I lived with in the closest of quarters. A shroud came down.The culture encouraged you to not speak out – so I didn’t. Rather than handing the tape in and reporting it, I threw it in the bin. You learn to close up, be quiet, just deal with it. Keep calm and carry on. I stayed at that school until I was 18.For decades, I was entirely oblivious to the impact of all this. I looked back on my time and thought only of freedom and independence. And I was successful: a short career in the city, before setting up a media business in Spain. But, It’s just things kept going wrong. However hard I tried, things would crumble. A crescendo of crises. I eventually did the work to understand myself better and started talking. I realised the narrative I’d written for my life only had the positives on it. I’d hidden the pain entirely. It’s what boarders do. Now, I have more harmony and joy in my life. Those negative experiences, effectively processed, have made me compassionate and helped me connect to others. It has made me a better person.Cathy Wield, 65, DorsetBoarded from the age of nineView image in fullscreen‘I was shouted at for being in tears’: Cathy Wield.Photograph: Karen Robinson/The ObserverMy father was in the diplomatic service. We were living in Thailand when I was sent to board. That was the done thing; a perk of the job, supposedly, as fees were paid by the government.We weren’t a boarding-school family by any means. Post war, neither of my parents went to university – so they thought this was an incredible opportunity. On arrival, I was instantaneously hit by the reality – that I was alone, and my parents had left me. I started crying, then I was shouted at for being in tears.Every moment of our lives was timetabled. We had to eat every item on our plates at meal times, in set seating. I hated cheese, I’d try to sneak it out to bin it. When caught, I’d be forced to eat it through my tears.The bullying was awful, and in boarding schools, it’s impossible to monitor. If anything, it was ignored on purpose, to help keep us under control. It was horrific: one girl was whipped with nettles and holly; water was poured on my bed to make it look like I’d wet it. Girls were made to eat soap and coerced into terrorising other pupils day and night. It was likeLord of the Flies. Emotionally, we were islands, unable to talk.Going home for the holidays became its own type of trauma: the prospect of going back loomed large. After the first 24 hours, the ticking time bomb started. It took 18 hours to fly back to London. I was so distraught the first time I had to make the post-holiday journey that each time after, I was tranquillised. I boarded until the age of 17.View image in fullscreenCathay Wield (on the left) at her boarding school.Photograph: Karen Robinson/The ObserverI went on to be a doctor in emergency medicine. I’ve only just retired. I always knew I hated what happened to me at school. I’m not someone who took decades to see the wood from the trees.I met my husband young, and we married soon after. I vowed never to send our children away. In my early 30s, our eldest child won a place at the Royal Ballet School – she’d be a weekly boarder. It dragged up all of my memories. We let her go, collected her every weekend, and kept an eye closely. I, however, had a breakdown, almost immediately. I sought help, and was put on antidepressants and then hospitalised – this episode lasted seven years. Only years later did a therapist realise that it was, in fact, PTSD.There’s very little understanding of the gender differences when it comes to boarding. We hear in the press of the plight of the boys, now: physical and sexual abuse. And, certainly, this happened to girls, too. But plenty of women like me feel unheard and ignored. We didn’t face that sensationalised violence, often. It was low-key, shame-based, neglectful. We were subject to derogatory comments. As growing girls, we had to learn about puberty and our changing bodies from each other. We were left to work it all out ourselves.As girls at that time, we weren’t being trained to be leaders, but to be submissive wives. Many from my school went on to be debutants. Breaking our spirits was the plan. A generation of women were raised to be quiet. This is why I wrote my book:Unshackled Mind: A Doctor’s Story of Trauma, Liberation and Healing. It took some years to find my voice.Harry Bolland, 28, GlastonburyBoarded from the age of 12View image in fullscreen‘A teacher grabbed me by the neck and threw me against a wall’: Harry Bolland.Photograph: Karen Robinson/The ObserverI’m still quite early in my journey of unpacking the impact of my experiences. At 28, it all still feels rather fresh. It was only a year or so ago that I even realised how much of a toll boarding took on me. Until recently, it was all but blanked out.As a child, I was a real free spirit. There was a charm to my early childhood – lots of space to roam. Cats and meadows and trees to climb upon, pretending to fight off imaginary orcs. I was a country boy with an imagination that ran wild. At boarding school, that’s not exactly encouraged.Mum and her sister had boarded. As far as I know, they both detested it. But mum thought I needed special attention for my, let’s say, challenging behaviour. She was convinced my school would be of help. I was the one who requested that I sleep at school sometimes. The relationship between me and my parents was difficult then; unharmonised. I thought boarding would give us some space.View image in fullscreenHarry Bolland at boarding school.Photograph: Karen Robinson/The ObserverJust one night per week at first. Then I convinced Mum to let me stay two. Soon, I was there from Tuesday morning to Friday night. Only, I couldn’t cope and landed up in trouble, repeatedly.Sure, boarding taught me about strength and resilience. But there’s no moment when you take off your uniform and express yourself. I felt suffocated and I acted out. A teacher grabbed me by the neck and threw me against a wall, shouting, because I’d locked my bedroom door and didn’t let him in once he’d knocked. These sound like stories from the old days, but it still happens. It’s like these places have been forgotten; an overlooked relic of history. Corporal punishment was prohibited in state schools in 1986. In private schools, it happened far later: England and Wales, 1998, and Scotland in 2000. It continued in Northern Ireland until 2003.I ended up being expelled. Afterwards, I attended a state school in Suffolk. It was set up to be far gentler, kinder and more compassionate. I couldn’t comprehend how different the environments felt. It’s an uncomfortable reality for many who see boarding schools as an integral element of their lineage; generation after generation upholding some British tradition that none want to admit is defunct. I make music now: producing, singing and playing the piano. My creativity was crushed at boarding school – but it wasn’t killed.Boarding on Insanity, directed by Ben Cole, can be streamed now atboardingoninsanity.comExplore more on these topicsEducationThe ObserverfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But when she started investigating muscles, she found this most durable tissue encapsulates who we areSat 19 Apr 2025 19.00 EDTShareMy earliest memories of childhood involve hugging my dad, and also punching him. Let me explain. My father, who moved from Hong Kong to New York in the late 1960s, was a professional artist and a black belt in karate. When my brother and I were kids, he trained us up in his studio, to draw and paint and punch and kick like him. “I wanted to make you into little ninjas,” he told me a few months ago, with his big laugh, as we worked out with the heavy bag at his home in China, where he lives today. He’s 78 now, but he subscribes to much the same programme he did when I was in nappies. What I understood from a young age is that art and exercise went hand in hand – and that muscle was beautiful in formandfunction.Our career as karate kids did not take off, since my brother and I were, and remain, constitutionally averse to conflict. But what did stick was a dedication to a life of physicality. We swam competitively, worked as lifeguards, taught swimming lessons, trained at the gym. My brother became a physical therapist and I became a journalist who writes about all kinds of things, much of it having to do with the art, science and culture of the body, and what it is to live a life in motion.I was a swimmer since before I can remember, but I didn’t learn to surf until I was almost 30. What this means is that while I adore the feeling of flying across water, I also appreciate the immense effort that’s required to make it seem easy – in other words, the work of achieving grace.A few years ago I began to consider muscle itself and its meaning. How it’s the stuff that moves us through the world, the engine behind every experience we have. I thought about the beauty of muscles and what they signify: a body of memory.And I remembered this quote from Tolstoy: “I want movement, not a calm course of existence.” At the most basic level, muscle powers and animates our lives. Cardiac, smooth, skeletal: these three different types of muscles make our hearts beat; push food through our intestines, blood through our vessels and babies out of the uterus; and attach to our bones and help us get around. Skeletal muscles are the ones we move at will, the others work under our body’s control, without our conscious effort. Individually, they do different things. Collectively, they drive us through our days.View image in fullscreen‘I understood from a young age that muscle was beautiful in form and function’: Bonnie Tsui.Photograph: Jessica Chou/The ObserverThe more I looked into muscles though, the more I realised how much we take them for granted. They’re a bit like the unsung heroes of our bodies; we think of them as rather dumb, versus the brains of the operation. But they have their own intelligence and their own kind of language.The newest science shows how critical muscle is to our physiological and metabolic health. Muscle is an endocrine tissue, which means that it’s constantly releasing signalling molecules that travel to other parts of the body, including the brain, where they affect cognition, mood and emotional behaviour, like a love letter from your muscle to your brain.Exercise especially stimulates this “brain-muscle cross talk” and those messenger molecules help determine specific beneficial responses in the brain, including the formation of new neurons and increased synaptic plasticity, both of which boost learning and memory. Bulking up muscles literally bulks up your brain.Not only is muscle chatty, but it also has its own kind of memory. Most of the time when we talk about muscle memory, we’re not talking about the muscles themselves, but about the memory of a co-ordinated movement pattern that lives in the motor neurons, which move our muscles. But in recent years, scientists have discovered that our muscles themselves have a memory all of their own for movement and exercise.“Athletes have always felt this to be true, to some extent,” saysAdam Sharples, a cellular biologist and professor at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences in Oslo who is also a former professional UK rugby league player. His muscle lab was the first to show that human skeletal muscle has an epigenetic memory of past exercise – in other words, certain genes are switched on so that muscle cells are primed to respond more rapidly to exercise in the future, even after a months-long pause (and perhaps even longer). What this means is that if you have to take time off from exercise due to injury or illness, your muscles remember how to rebuild.‘Muscle is remarkably adaptable. It’s one of the few tissues that adapts and changes on an everyday basis’What I love about this is that we all have the capacity to bounce back and that a hiatus from exercise due to changes in life circumstances doesn’t mean you have to start all over again. The benefit of coming back to it is that exercise can reset our muscles to a healthier state, whether you’re a recovering star athlete or an older person contemplating a return to activity.Our bodies inevitably change over time, but muscle is remarkably adaptable – it’s one of the very few tissues that adapts and changes on an everyday basis. Your body on exercise, even after a few minutes, releases a wash of molecules that change you: turning genes on and off, waking up immune cells, controlling inflammation, adjusting levels of blood sugar, ramping up metabolism, healing tissue and more. In a very real way, these researchers are working on how we might be able to remind our muscles – and ourselves – to stay strong throughout our lives.Building muscle to support the joyful things you want to do, whether it’s swimming or surfing or dancing or lifting your kids or grandkids into the air when you see them, is the best reason to do it. This looks different for each of us, but the principle is the same. Muscle is potential, and strength, and owning your own strength. All so you can keep doing the things you love.Which brings me to the subject of jumping. Learning how to jump – the way we learn other early movements that include running, climbing and lifting – is foundational to human development. We do it when we’re young, when we’re figuring out how to use our bodies correctly and how to interact with our environment. And yet jumping also means play, levitation and flight.Even Charles Darwin had a thing or two to say about jumping, as a movement that’s conducive to joy. “Under a transport of Joy or of vivid Pleasure, there is a strong tendency to various purposeless movements,” he observed inThe Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, published in 1872. “We see this in our young children, in their loud laughter, clapping of hands and jumping for joy.” We humans share this essential tendency with others in the animal kingdom: dogs bounding, horses leaping, whales breaching. Our bodies are built to move: muscles make that happen. There’s something enchanting about pure movement for itself.But our human relationship with muscles can be complicated. Across history, muscular women have disrupted the binary gender and power dynamics that have long governed society: men are equated with strength, women with weakness. When a woman is deemed too muscular, it’s often because her strength is perceived as taking away from someone else or that her strength is somehow unseemly, unfair or unnatural. This zero-sum thinking encourages a worldview in which muscularity and physical strength for women is a threat to societal order, domestic harmony and reproductive responsibility. Well into the 20th century, women were warned not to lift weights or other heavy things or their uteruses might fall out, and endanger those reproductive responsibilities.The phrase “too muscular” might seem to be a superficial matter of aesthetics, but it is a charge that has been levied in many arenas against women who dare to be physically strong. The pioneering powerlifter Jan Todd, for one, was the first woman to lift the Scottish stones of strength known as theDinnie Stones. In the process, she disrupted stone-lifting practices that were for centuries linked to rituals of manhood. After all, what significance did manhood stones possess if women could lift them too?I was largely inoculated to this simplistic stereotypical model of muscle by my own upbringing, but not so much that I couldn’t see the contrast. I’m not immune to what the culture tells me I should look like. But I like that sports helped me to not be ashamed of my body’s appearance. I have my own vanity about my swimmer’s shoulders, my strong legs and kick; I like what they tell me. To be proud of their power, of how well they work.View image in fullscreenA young Bonnie surfing on her father’s knees.Photograph: Courtesy Bonnie TsuiAs a kid, I learned to do handstands from my dad; as an adult, I began doing headstands as a regular practice in yoga. If I ask myself why I still do them, I realise that I like going upside down because it not only encourages a radical shift in body awareness, but also in perspective.These days, more than half the people I see in the gym powerlifting at lunchtime are women. The idea about who is allowed to own their own muscle is changing.From the start of my investigation of muscle and its meaning, it was clear that muscle as a tangible thing has such fascinating and outsized influence on how we think about ourselves as people. That the qualities of muscle that we admire are a kind of shorthand for character. We tell ourselves to be strong, to show good form, to be a person of action, to be flexible, to muscle through hard things. To endure and go the distance.Even in the discouragement of action, we’re telling ourselves torelax– to let go.What I’m really trying to say is that musclehood is personhood. Whether we know it or not, we’re talking about the metaphysics of muscle. There’s a philosophy of life and humanity that can be found in muscle and what it allows us to do, beyond the physical self.I love how muscles are an analogue for so many things in life that we must practise: compassion, generosity, bravery. The idea that we have the ability to grow when we slowly and consistently do hard work. To examine muscle is to observe human nature. It’s about our relationship to our bodies: what they – and thus we – are capable of.An extract from Bonnie Tsui’s latest book,On MuscleThe most joyful thing I’ve been practising is walking on water. When I do, I try not to run, because running on a surfboard is a recipe for disaster. Unlike land, water is an unstable platform; on a longboard, measured, unhurried steps, with control, is the goal.Which brings us to grace. Anton Chekhov described grace as occurring ‘when someone expends the least amount of motion on a given action’. Grace, in part, is about restraint, physical calm in the face of uncertainty.There was a time when the physics of surfing seemed impossible to me. What was involved in order to dance on the water with grace was mind-boggling: spotting a wave, negotiating a constantly moving and changing surface, paddling into the right position, getting to your feet, finding balance, keeping your feet connected to the board and also moving those feet to shift your weight, all while reading the changes in the water and maintaining speed. Not to mention having an awareness of countless other bodies and boards that are also moving.There’s no way to get around paying your dues in the water – to learn all the many and specific variables, and then to be capable of synthesising it all into a reasonable gestalt for various situations. The symphony of muscles acting together takes practice. There’s a temporal aspect, because it’s something you repeat to the tune of many years. Grace, then, is also about endurance.When I emerge from a long surf, run or swim, the tiredness in my muscles tells me that I’ve done something worthwhile. The state of aching is not always a bad one; in this case, the residual burn is a symptom of what it means to live a life of the body. The restless vibration of my spine has quieted; my body is relaxed and so is my mind.The effect of this muscle exploration is that I’ve had to participate in my own studies of character. Strength, form, action, flexibility, endurance: all of these are qualities of muscle that we strive for in personhood. With grace, the beauty and elegance in movement comes from a seeming effortlessness and ease. But we all know that nothing comes without hard work.Let us look instead at the effort behind the apparent ease. Let us honour all the time and work – the stretching, heaving, grimacing – that has gone into achieving the oneness of your body with the world, the connection you can feel with something, or someone, outside of yourself. To be in the ballet of life around you. What I take away from the enterprise is the complexity of all that muscle signifies about what we desire and who we want to be.On Muscle: The Stuff That Moves Us and Why It Matters by Bonnie Tsui (Headline Press, £16.99) is out on 22 April.

He was happy to talk about his emotions.”When they broke up, however, Samantha, who is in her 30s and based in Sheffield, saw a very different side to him. She recalls going to his flat to collect her belongings. “I got into a debate with him,” she says. “It became clear his beliefs had become centred around the idea that men are more sexual than women, and men and women can’t be friends.“He said: ‘Now we are not together, I don’t need to agree with everything you say.’”He told her he had become involved during the pandemic in what he described as a men’s mental health group. Samantha has since discovered the group was influenced by Canadian psychologistJordan Peterson, who has expressed controversial views about women, and a far-right Swedish influencer whom her ex-boyfriend had appeared with in photos on social media. “It’s that strand of the manosphere that is focused on self-help and spirituality,” she says. “The whole time we were together, there were no warning signs.”View image in fullscreenCharities have observed a crossover between men involved in the manosphere and the far right.Photograph: Edefoto/Getty ImagesSamantha’s experience is not an isolated case. Several women told theObservertheir partners had been sucked into themanosphere– the name given to parts of the internet that circulate misogynist content – or consumed far-right material online.With surveys reporting that an increasing number of young men are subscribing to these beliefs, the number of women finding that their partners share the misogynistic views espoused bythe likes of Andrew Tateis also on the rise. Research from anti-fascism organisation Hope Not Hate, which polled about 2,000 people across the UK aged 16 to 24, discovered that 41% of young men supportTateversus just 12% of young women.“Numbers are growing, with wives worried about their husbands and partners becoming radicalised,” saysNigel Bromage, a reformed neo-Nazi who is now the director of Exit Hate Trust, a charity that helps people who want to leave the far right.“Wives or partners become really worried about the impact on their family, especially those with young children, as they fear they will be influenced by extremism and racism.”His organisation supports women whose loved ones become involved in the manosphere or thefar right, as well as the individuals themselves.Bromage, who was involved in far-right groups for two decades, warns that the charity is seeing a “crossover” between those involved in the manosphere and the wider far right.“Over the last few years, the rhetoric of the manosphere has increasingly leaked out of isolated forums on to mainstream platforms,” says Anki Deo, Hope Not Hate’s senior policy officer. “It has been taken up by ­influencers with a much wider audience and is no longer just a ‘dark ­corner of the internet’.”Rachel, who is in her 30s and lives in London, met her partner on the popular dating app Hinge, and was struck by his generosity. He insisted on buying her gifts and giving her cash to spend. She thought her now ex-partner was a “normal, decent guy”. But as the relationship progressed, she began to feel uneasy as he forced more gifts on her. Four months into the relationship, she began to realise his political views were profoundly different from her own.“I was talking about the gay community. He got aggressive with me,” Rachel recalls. “He was super homophobic – I didn’t know until then.”A few days later, he interrupted an argument to show her a video of Tate. “I don’t think Tate fuelled him,” Rachel says. “He was always like that, but it validated his beliefs. He really liked the flashy lifestyle. He just had a lot of hatred.”He became more controlling as the relationship unfolded, she recalls, complaining that she had male friends and a career. He argued that she shouldn’t be focused on work because it was his duty to provide for her.The relationship ended after six months. His behaviour had escalated to the point where he raped and assaulted her, and was convicted of both offences after they broke up.View image in fullscreenJordan Peterson addresses the Demographic Summit at the Fine Arts Museum in Budapest in 2023.Photograph: Attila Kisbenedek/AFP/Getty ImagesDr Lisa Sugiura, associate professor in cybercrime and gender at the University of Portsmouth, who specialises in online misogyny, says that although there is widespread concern about men being radicalised by the manosphere, there is not enough focus on the “really concerning” risk these individuals pose to their female partners.Commonly held views in the manosphere, says Sugiura, include being anti-feminist, thinking that misandry is equivalent to misogyny and believing society is systemically sexist against men. “They want to go back to this time where women had no rights in society at all and were completely owned by their father and then their husband.”Debbie, who is in her 50s, says her ex-husband’s “mask started to slip” after they moved in together. “When I got a good job and started earning more money, passed my driving test and became more independent, that was when he started watching far-right and misogynistic content online,” she says.Her husband was an avid fan of a YouTuber known for his misogynistic and Islamophobic views, and also consumed content from Christian militia groups, Debbie says.“He put crucifixes all over the back of his van. The reason I knew what content he was viewing was because he would proudly talk about it in front of our kids.”She says he told her that he hated feminists and the women’s liberation movement. Debbie also says he was violent towards her.Beyond Andrew Tate: the imitators who help promote misogyny onlineRead moreRoisin, from Belfast, says that after she broke up with her partner, he began subscribing to increasingly extreme views. She shares a daughter with him and says he has shown her manosphere videos and told her that she can’t leave the house in certain clothes.“He has made derogatory remarks about other races and cultures in front of her,” Roisin adds. “And said: ‘If you ever got pregnant, I wouldn’t allow you to get an abortion.’”Sugiura says that female partners of men sucked into the manosphere are being neglected by society. “I don’t think anybody is thinking about the impact on them. There is concern for these people who are being indoctrinated or radicalised by these harmful ideologies, but what is the risk to those in relationships with them?“We need to ensure their voices and experiences are not forgotten.”Names have been changed to protect identitiesExplore more on these topicsMenModern masculinityWomenAndrew TateJordan PetersonThe far rightSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

I most definitely am. But my smile drops as she continues: “That’s all the niceness you’ll be getting from me today, then.” She is, of course, joking but, as with most jokes, there is a glimmer of truth behind it.I am in Newmarket, Suffolk, for theGibsons British Jigsaw Championship, which has been held here for the past 11 years. Competitors battle it out to be in with a chance of the £100 first-place prize money. There are three categories: Fun, Pairs and Elites, who would expect to complete a 1,000-piece puzzle in under three hours. In 2023, Elite nine-time British champion Sarah Mills finished her puzzle in 1 hour 52 minutes, meaning she was doing a jaw-dropping eight pieces per minute.Six months earlier, and without having done a puzzle for more than 10 years, I had naively decided there was nothing greater than a challenge and signed up to the Elites competition. I figured that six months would be enough training to be in with a chance; I mean it’s only a 1,000-piece puzzle – how hard could it really be?It’s estimated that £24m-worth of puzzles were sold in the UK during 2022. This is projected to grow 3.21% by 2028. As I scour the internet in search of puzzles, I am struck by how expensive they are. Some people say you can’t put a price on fun, but with an average of £15-£20, I end up turning to secondhand sellers flogging them for about £5 instead.I settle on a 500-piece 1970s sweets-themed puzzle and am instantly flooded with nostalgia, transported back to when I was eight and my grandma and I would share a tray on our lap as we puzzled together. I put on a timer and order myself a pizza, but it soon goes cold as I lock in. It takes me four hours and I am elated.Janet Ramsay-Helie has organised the competition since it began. She got the idea when a friend came back from a holiday on the Isle of Wight and told her all about a puzzle competition. Figuring they had nothing to lose, they decided to give it a go and put on their own in Newmarket. Over the years, the competition has become so big that, last year, they had to hold it in three separate halls. Competitors arrive from all over the world. I assume Janet must be a puzzle master herself, but she confesses: “I don’t do them. Actually, that’s a bit of a lie. I do them occasionally, but if I start one, I find it difficult not to finish. I haven’t got the time to sit and do it like that, I get lost in it. I used to do them and found it was one or two o’clock in the morning.”I practise by doing a puzzle a week, flowers, maps of London and animals; but cats soon become my arch enemy. Initially I had been drawn to their cute faces, submerged within whimsical floral baskets or playing with balls of wool. Quickly, I realise that an image of 15 cats with almost identical colourings and faces is what my puzzling nightmares are made of. Three days into my first ever 1,000-piece puzzle I finally have to give up, unable to distinguish between five white kittens.Just a few days after my disastrous attempt, I catch a woman dumping a bag of rubbish in my front garden. I ask her to take it with her, but she runs off shouting: “Have it – it’s free!” Baffled, I open the bag to find four 1000-piece cat puzzles inside. In what seems like a bizarre prank from the universe, it reminds me to keep pushing through my fear of cats.While most people suggest starting with the edges, this is not Mill’s technique. “I start with colours. I start sorting through the pieces and pull out the big patches of colour. A lot of people like having the edges as a frame. But I’m more about putting areas together, if I have a frame it gets in the way.”View image in fullscreen‘The frantic scramble of the thousands of puzzle pieces being tipped on to tables and sorted reverberates around the room'.’Photograph: Alfonso Alvarez-OssorioIn 2019, Sarah also competed in the world championship in Spain and came fourth, but even she gets nervous about the British championship. “The adrenaline kicks in, though, doesn’t it? So I just sort of focus on what I’m doing and try not to think about everyone else.”The British event is run by volunteers. Janet explains that once first, second and third place has been established in each category, they don’t rank participants past that. “We have people that feel it doesn’t seem very fair as they are travelling a long way to compete, but you’ve got to realise that some take six hours to finish. We haven’t got the people to wait around for a few competitors to make it to the end,” she explains. I gulp, praying that I finish faster than six hours.Come 23 June,I try to stay in the “weirder things have happened” mindset when thinking about my chances of winning. I walk into the Rowley Mile racecourse and am overwhelmed by the number of competitors. I pass a pair setting up an easel-like structure, hundreds of colour-sorting boxes, people in matching hats and T-shirts, people wearing noise-cancelling headphones and bringing out scissors – to save time picking the sticker-seal off the box to open it. I look glumly at the simplicity of my own set-up and wonder if it will be my downfall, before remembering that Sarah doesn’t have any tools either. If it’s good enough for the British champion, it’ll be good enough for me.The puzzle makes me nervous; it’s a scene made up of 28 faces at a puzzle festival. Although incredibly apt for the competition, the thousands of tiny puzzle boxes and picture frames with similar images look tricky. There are a lot of very similar colours and patterns and I know how much of a nightmare this will be. The gentle whisper of people talking strategies floats through the room like a ghostly echo and I hear rustling from tables around me as competitors bring out sweets, flasks, biscuits and sandwiches.A very intense-looking competitor walks past my table before softening and giving me a comforting “good luck” nod. He approaches his table, just before Janet announces over the Tannoy that the competition is about to begin. There is a gentle murmur among the competitors while they press record on their phones, which are placed on bird’s-eye-view tripods. “We will count down from five and then the puzzle will commence,’’ Janet booms. The frantic sound of thousands of puzzle pieces being tipped out and sorted reverberates around the room as she shouts: “Go!”An hour in, I hear a commotion as one couple hiss they are missing three pieces. They scramble around on the floor briefly before shouting “finished” and sealing their fate with a kiss. After just 1 hour and 5 minutes, veterinarian couple Peter and Nikki Thomas are the first to finish in the Pairs category. Just nine minutes later, Sarah, who looks as relaxed as someone on a beach holiday, also shouts “finished”. I’ve barely done a quarter by the time most are nearly done.Three hours in, those around me have gone to get lunch as they’ve completed their puzzle and all winners have been declared. “Keep going,” says one person with a thumbs up. My back is burning from craning over the table and no amount of stretching is easing the pain. By 2pm I have to stop as I haven’t finished and the awards are being handed out.As I approach the crowd for the trophy ceremony, I meet the Pairs winners and introduce myself, sheepishly chuckling about how hard I found it and congratulating them. “You completed it, though, and that’s something to be proud of,” Peter Thomas says. I burst into hysterics as I explain I hadn’t actually finished it. “At least you had fun,” he grimaces.We’ve met lots of people, the community is amazing. It’s full of friendly, brilliant folkThe Thomases have an infectious enthusiasm for jigsaw puzzles. They both enjoy doing them to relax and will often debate about who has the better technique. In autumn 2022, while on holiday, they joked that if ever there was a puzzling competition, they would enter it. After watching YouTube videos, they discovered speed puzzling and their competition days began. “We didn’t really know what we were doing when we entered in 2023.”They came second in the British championship and decided to then enter the 2023 world championships in Spain, where they came 60th.Their strategy is simple: split the puzzle into two lines, each person tackling different areas. Peter constructs the puzzle upside down and Nikki is in charge of faces. They are now forming a team to go to the world championship again in Spain later this year, hoping to rank at least 30th. “We’ve met lots of people, the community is amazing. It’s full of friendly, brilliant folk.”I feel a glimmer of hope. Maybe one day I can train long enough to join a team? “I think no one can really break into that top 10 by training. You’ve either got it or you haven’t, but I do think you can train and get marginal gains,” says Peter. To them, the people who “have it” seem to have their main skillset in organisation, dexterity and pattern recognition.When I get outside, people are busy with puzzle swaps out of their car boots and it feels like the perfect example of the sense of community that grows from doing puzzles and why, perhaps, more of us might benefit from taking it up. For me, I’ve found joy in reconnecting with a hobby I did all those years ago with my grandmother and that’s a memory more precious than coming first in a competition.Explore more on these topicsPuzzle gamesThe ObserverEventsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then I could plaster it with those “I bought this before Elon went mad” stickers, shamefacedly sell it at a loss and write a performative social media post about no longer being able to stomach the guilt of driving it around town. But as I don’t actually own a car, let alone a Tesla, I’ve felt unable to add my voice to the anti-Musk and anti-Trump protests gaining momentum around the world. Until now.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Of course, I will not be travelling to the US at any time soon. As former US secretary of laborRobert Reichwrites, why reward Trump’s America with my tourist dollars? But as I wasn’t planning to visit America, this doesn’t feel like a sacrifice, let alone a meaningful one. So the appearance of the #BoycottUSA movement has arrived at just the right time.Here is a campaignI can sign up to wholeheartedly. But I plan to go further than the one in three French people who are merely “avoiding” American products. Instead, I am proposing a total purge, ridding my house and my life of any taint of Americana. Not a Marlboro will be smoked, no Manhattan drunk, no foot stomped to the exuberant refrain of Cotton Eye Joe.These are, of course, mere gestures. Eschewing Marlboros and line-dancing is no sacrifice at all, though turning down a perfect Manhattan will be tough. I know that if I am going to be serious about de-Americanisingeverything,I have to get systematic about it. There will need to be research and auditing, rules and considerations and caveats and, above all, self-control, commitment and discipline.So, to keep myself on this righteous path and to help others similarly appalled by America’s descent into authoritarian plutocracy cleanse their lives of Yankee fare, I offer the rules of the game and an incomplete review of everything that I will be replacing with un-American alternatives.The rules1No American product may be bought or American service used. No exceptions. (But what about Apple, I hear you say. They have rejected calls to remove DEI policies! What about Patagonia? They are the good guys! Yes, and yes, of course some American companies – and some Americans – are good. But “whataboutery” won’t get us anywhere.)2If an American product has been previously bought, it can be used until it breaks, at which point it cannot be replaced by another American product. (Note: if a working product, eg an iPhone, uses American services, eg iCloud storage, it must be immediately replaced by a product that does not require American services to work.) Similarly, one is allowed to keep any existing American friends, but making new American friends is verboten.3If an artist (a writer, musician, film-maker, actor, whatever) is American, their work is taboo. It is acceptable to experience American art on existing physical formats but, as per Rule 2, these cannot be replaced once defunct. (To support American artists is to support the American Military-Media-Entertainment Complex. Sorry, Bruce.)4It’s not a principle if it doesn’t cost you something.So, now that we are clear about the rules, it’s time to apply them, starting with the trickiest area of all: technology. You might imagine me to be a typical metropolitan media douche, swanning around coffee shops with my bestickered MacBook Air while using my Apple Watch to pay for my £4.30 flat whites. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. I actually swan around coffee shops with an unstickered Google Chromebook and I use a Garmin running watch to pay for my £4.50 pour over, thank you very much.But whether you are an Apple fanatic or a Google diehard, replacing hardware and software is going to be painful, costly and complicated, and will involve unfamiliar systems with steep learning curves. It is possible to replace US hardware with Chinese or Taiwanese equivalents but as these come with their own moral issues, I’ve forced myself to look for European devices, which makes for a harder, but more self-congratulatory journey. Just imagine how smug it will feel to have mastered a whole new operating system on a European laptop and to send an inaugural text message on a sustainable European phone!So, I will be replacing my Google Pixelbook Go with a GermanTuxedo InfinityBook Pro 14running its own version of the Linux (developed at the University of Helsinki) operating system. My Google Pixel 8a Android phone is going to be swapped out with a Franco-DutchMurena Fairphone 5running the “deGoogled” /e/OS and my American Garmin will be replaced by a FinnishSuuntowatch.But even avoiding US tech brands does not guarantee that a phone or laptop will be completely un-American. Fairphone uses soldering paste made out of recycled tin (good!) made for them by Connecticut-based MacDermid Alpha (bad!). And their phone chips are made in Asia by US-based Qualcomm. Tuxedo does not specify where its components come from, though it says that the vast majority are made in Asia and imported to Germany where its laptops are assembled. Surprisingly, it turns out that phones and laptops are complex devices with many, many, many components and also the global supply chain is very complicated indeed. Don’t lift the rock if you’re squeamish about what you might find underneath.With hardware mostly sorted, it’s time to get familiar with open source software, as I won’t be able to use the vast majority of apps that come with Apple or Android devices. No more Gmail, Google Maps or Apple Photos. Instead, I’ll be switching toProton Mail(based in Switzerland, home of lots of privacy-focused apps),OpenStreetMap(or UK-basedCitymapperfor urbanites) andImmich, a photo library that I’ll be hosting myself instead of paying Apple or Google for the privilege. Video calling with Zoom and Google Meet can be supplanted by NorwegianWhereby,while word processing, spreadsheets and presentations will all be handled byLibreOffice, part of the non-profit Berlin-basedDocument Foundation.Au revoirMicrosoft Teams, you will not be missed.Never again will I groove to Marvin, Aretha or Otis. Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, time to saddle up and ride into the sunsetAs anyone who has tried to switch from Android to iPhone or Mac to PC knows, familiarity is a major barrier to change. Abandoning tools and services I’ve used for years (decades, in the case of Gmail) and learning new systems, new terminology and new shortcuts is tedious, expensive and frustrating. I’ve always thought of myself as “good at the internet”, but trying to work out how to get public transport directions in OpenStreetMap or make a LibreOffice document look as if it has been designed by somebody with working eyes is making me feel tired and old.When it comes to social media, things get really tricky. I obviously deleted my X/Twitter account long ago but, according to Rule 1, I will have to delete my Bluesky profile and turn to its nerdier cousinMastodon. Hey, at least I won’t stumble across Piers Morgan there. And a smaller, less shouty social network that doesn’t demand much attention reduces the risk of making any new American friends or contacts (Rule 2). I’m sure there are plenty of good, well-meaning Americans out there sharing good and interesting insights, reckonings, gifs and feelings, so please don’t think I’m being rude if I block, mute or ignore you until 2028. I’m just following the rules.YouTube is, I fear, fairly irreplaceable. I could up my TikTok usage (it’s Chinese-owned) but as the point of this whole exercise is to make me a better person, will that really work? I’ve triedDailymotion(the French YouTube) and it simply doesn’t scratch that itch. There’s just so much less of it. If your hope is that a French YouTube will be infused with subtle yet sophisticated Gallic charm, then I am going to have to disappoint you.Netflix, Apple TV+, Disney+ and Prime Video will all have to go.ArrivederciThe Studio, Reacher and Slow Horses.HastaluegoSeinfeld repeats, Breaking Bad binges and The Good Place water cooler moments. But thankfully we still have the Great British Broadcasting Corporation and its tip-top iPlayer service. I haven’t watched EastEnders since the early 1990s.

But remember, no streaming of American music – we don’t want royalties falling into the wrong hands. On Spotify you can block artists so they don’t appear in your recommendations. Setting up this block list will be the cultural self-flagellation that demonstrates total devotion to the cause. Never again will I groove around the kitchen to Marvin, Aretha or Otis. Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris, time to saddle up and ride into the sunset. No, Alexa, do not play Not Like Us by Kendrick Lamar from Spotify. This one’s going to hurt.And then there’s Amazon. Finding alternatives to “the world’s most customer-centric company” is a non-negotiable. While Waterstones has a US investment group as its majority shareholder, there are plenty of other places that will post a book to you includinguk.bookshop.org, which gives a significant proportion of its profits to local independent booksellers. Non-book items will require more shopping around, more patience and will probably come at a higher cost, but at least I’ll be sleeping with a clear conscience while I wait.Next up is a room-by-room property inspection to see where further American invaders can be eradicated. The kitchen is a battlefield as a small number of giant US food conglomerates own a great many European brands, all of which must now be purged from fridges and cupboards. Is there anything more English than Gary Lineker flogging a salt and vinegar crisp? Think again, for Walkers is owned by Frito-Lay, itself owned by PepsiCo. No Wotsit, Quaver, Frazzle or Monster Munch (sob!) shall pass my lips again.View image in fullscreen‘According to Rule 2, I can wear my Converse All Stars until they fall apart, at which point they will be replaced by German Pumas.’Photograph: Pål Hansen/The GuardianThe list of prohibited foods is lengthy and surprising, and it will be necessary to get familiar with all the brands owned and managed byKraft Heinz,General MillsandMondelézto ensure that no proscribed product accidentally gets into the shopping trolley. It’s going to be easiest to print out a list of these products (only a dozen or so pages in 9pt type) to take to the supermarket on every shop. And printouts have the benefit of being able to be waved aggressively at anyone I spot reaching for the Alvalle Gazpacho (made in Spain, owned byPepsiCo) in Waitrose.In the cupboard under the sink and in the bathroom, I thought it would simply be a question of replacing anything fromProcter & Gamblewith the equivalent item from Anglo-Dutch Unilever. Begone Ariel, Oral B and Olay.WilkommenPersil, Signal and Dove. But as Unilever owns a huge number of US brands, again it becomes a question of a forensic inspection of the labels and an encyclopedic knowledge of American corporate hierarchies. I might have to follow the example of my French mother-in-law who makes her own washing liquid by blending Savon de Marseille, warm water and bicarbonate of soda. I don’t think this is a political gesture, though with the French you can never be sure. For my part, I will be washing only in the finestEau de Thames Waterfollowed by a quick spritz of Unilever-owned Brut.As someone who hasn’t worn a pair of Levi’s since Nick Kamen left the scene, a boycott of American clothing is barely a challenge. According to Rule 2, I can wear my Converse All Stars until they fall apart, at which point they will be replaced by German Pumas or Italian Diadoras. Zara (Spanish) and Uniqlo (Japanese) will dress me from head to toe, though strangely most men’s underpants brands do seem to be American. Thank God for Marks & Spencer.Then, just as I light a Gauloise to celebrate the complete decontamination of my life, I come across three issues that make melet out a Homer Simpson-esque “Doh!” in frustration. First, it is not possible to find a bank that doesn’t use either Visa or Mastercard to process payments and every time a payment is processed, one of these two US businesses gets a cut. Stockholm-based Klarna might be a non-US option for some online payments and there is talk of the European Central Bank issuing “digital euros” later this decade, but I doubt I’ll be able to take advantage of it here in Brexity Blighty. So, short of keeping wads of notes stashed in the mattress and shopping only in stores that still take cash, there doesn’t seem any practical way of deAmericanising this particular aspect of modern life.The case for boycotting the United States | Robert ReichRead moreAnd in further fiscal frustration, if your pension plan is anything like mine, it is likely to hold a mixture of investments including UK, European and US stocks. I asked the very sensible person who administers my pension whether I could get rid of my US investments and was told it is possible, “although probably rather unwise as divesting completely from US holdings reduces geographic diversification, which could impact risk-adjusted returns”. I suspect in this context “rather unwise” actually means “Does this idiot even understand how money works?” Call me a coward, but incurring the wrath of my wife by jeopardising her future financial security is too great a risk for me to contemplate.And then I was reminded of something that has made me doubt whether I can do any of this at all. Because Arsenal – the football team I support and read about and think about and care about a little too much – are, like nine other Premier League clubs, American-owned. And not just any American, but shopping mall developer, married-to-Walmart-heiress all-American American. Dang! Even if the nearest British-owned team were not our hated rivals Tottenham, I just can’t switch allegiance. I’m going to have to give up football itself. But not now, not yet, not with the excitement of a European quarter-final so fresh in the memory. Sorry.So, yeah, I’m keeping my bank account, my pension, my football team (for now) and, I hope, my marriage. This exercise is not about rejecting the modern world or the pleasures and comforts of modern life. It’s about turning away from America and turning towards Europe. One day I’d love to go back to the States and eat a cheeseburger in a Brooklyn dive bar, toasting old friends and new with shots of rail bourbon in the Land of the Free. But not for the time being, not under the current regime.So pour me aRob Roy, give me a packet of Marmite-flavoured peanuts and sit me down in front of Antiques Roadshow, I’ll be grand. Up on the moral high ground life is sweet, if a little lonely. See, my family refuse to close their WhatsApp accounts and join me on Telegram and I think they might be talking about me behind my back. I get lost all the time and no one is liking or sharing the photos I post toPixelfed. And I really miss my friends and our group chats, miss the videos and in-jokes and playlists we share, the things that have nourished our relationships over the years.But it’s OK. It’s not a principle if it doesn’t cost you something.Explore more on these topicsShoppingConsumer spendingRetail industryFood & drink industryTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Archive photograph: courtesy of Sally PhillipsBorn in Hong Kong in 1970,Sally Phillipsis a comedian, writer and actor. After graduating with a first-class degree in Italian and linguistics at Oxford University, she began working as an actor. In 1997 she was cast in I’m Alan Partridge, and two years later she co-wrote and starred in sketch comedy Smack the Pony, followed by roles in Big Train, Veep, Miranda and the Bridget Jones franchise. She has three children and currently lives between London and Australia. Sally stars in new comedy drama Austin on BBC One on Fridays.Sally (front left)My mum, dad, brother and I are outside our house in Hong Kong. Andrew and I are both in knitted ponchos, which I’m certain my mother was responsible for. My dad worked for British Airways, so we moved around a lot. If you have that kind of nomadic upbringing, you are naturally an outsider wherever you go. I spent a lot of my childhood observing, mainly the things that were funny and strange.Our parents were quite tough on us growing up. My mother especially. She would claim her toughness is because of her Yorkshire roots, but I’ve been to Yorkshire and met lots of soft people. She would say: “Well-behaved women rarely make history.” I wasn’t allowed a Barbie and instead had an Action Girl with a jumpsuit and ginger hair. Mum nurtured us in subtle ways; the house was filled with costumes and art supplies.When it comes to being funny, I believe there are two types of brains: one is a satirist who is good with words; the other is an idiot who walks into the wall. I was the latter; Andrew the former. He had a joke about a bulldozer that my mother still goes on about.Comic Lou Sanders: ‘I went around the houses trying to find my onstage persona. Turns out, it’s just me’Read moreAt first I wanted to be the kind of actress who plays Juliet at the RSC, but it turns out there’s something about me that stops people taking me seriously. That was quite devastating for a while. At university I co-wrote a one-woman show – Benedetta, the Life of a Lesbian Nun in Renaissance Italy – based on the true story of Benedetta Carlini. It was a big, serious endeavour: an hour and a half of me doing 50 different characters, lots of accents and a significant amount of mime. My parents, unfortunately, found it hilarious.When I graduated, they hoped I might work for Shell or Olivetti. Instead, I considered doing a PhD on the spaghetti western, which was not met with much approval. I then decided I would go to clown school, which they were also strongly opposed to. But I started to get work, and gradually the feedback evolved from “What a ridiculous idea” to “Well done”.I realised if you could push against your parents’ disapproval, you probably had the determination to work in this profession, as it can be quite a bruising industry. Even though I’ve been doing it for decades, it still is. Some doors I open and everyone goes, “You’re a genius!”, and behind another they’ll say, “You’re so yesterday. You’re so old and fat and exactly not what we’re looking for.”When my son Olly was born with Down’s syndrome, I moved closer to my parents, and they created a kind of crisis encampment. Dad said: “We’re going to operate a visa system, and you get to decide who is allowed into the flat and who isn’t.” It was incredible, especially as my marriage didn’t work out. Olly knows he can ring his uncle at any hour, day or night, and he’ll answer, and probably take him to the pub.There are probably families that are closer than ours – we do have a strong vein of eating crisps in different rooms while watching different TV shows – but I have totally lucked out. I don’t think I could have managed the hand I’ve been dealt without my family’s support.Andrew (brother, front right)Was Sally funny as a child? I always thought she laughed too much at her own jokes. But we got on. While I can’t recall fighting much, we certainly would have clashed. Take our approach to Easter eggs. I was in the “eat them all in one go” category. She was in the “save it and have a little bit at a time” category. Naturally, when mine was finished, I’d go after hers.When Smack the Pony was on billboards around London, I’d think: “Jesus, that’s my sister.” It was bizarre but then you get used to it. Although I do still find myself getting mildly freaked out if I hear her voice on TV.Sally is a very supportive big sister. Very pro-family, very into keeping people together. She stays in touch with relatives who I can’t even recall how I’m related to, and she does a Sunday roast for everyone whenever she can. All of which is quite amazing, especially bearing in mind how busy she generally is.Sally is genuine, she’s helpful and she can be hilarious. Not all the time. But sometimes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

One day we had a 5ft snake in it.Shortly after this was taken, I had a succession of postings: Zambia, Brunei, Lebanon, London, the Gulf, Australia, Italy, then back to London. It was a very interesting childhood for Sally, experiencing the different cultures.Like most daddies would say about their daughters, Sally was absolutely delightful. Very smiley and so bright. You would read her a story and a week later she would remember the words. When we were in Bahrain, an opera singer came to our house. She overheard Sally singing, and said she had perfect pitch.I told her she’d be unemployed 99% of the time. She put me back in my box, and I was so impressedWhen Sally finished at Oxford with a first, I was so proud of her. I asked her what she was going to do next, and she said: “I’m going to be an actress.” I said: “Don’t be so ridiculous. You’ll be unemployed 99% of the time.” She replied: “Somebody’s got to succeed. Why not me?” She put me back in my box, and I was so impressed.Since then she has had the pressure of being a working mother and managing Olly, but people rally around her because she is such a great friend to them. It hasn’t been easy. But, like anyone who has met Sally will tell you, she’s always good news.Elizabeth (mother, far right)Sally was absolutely beautiful when she was born. Actually, I take that back. Initially she had a big bump on her head as they pulled her out of me with a suction device. But in the end she was all right.Sally was very good at keeping her brothers in order. She’s the eldest of three. She was also excellent at occupying herself, making up games and putting on plays.When Smack the Pony came out there were massive posters of the cast everywhere. It was lovely to see Sally get the credit she deserved. What I admired most was their approach to humour – it was for women, making fun of women. We hadn’t seen that before on television.Sally is perceptive and has good taste. Are we similar? Well, I wouldn’t think so. She’s much better.Explore more on these topicsSally PhillipsFlashbackFamilyPhotographyTV comedyComedyTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told toKitty DrakeSat 19 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTShareNick, 64For thepast two yearswe’ve been meeting up once a month, but I want moreA couple of years ago I was in the pub with a friend, several pints deep, and he asked whether I’d ever had a “great love”. I was 62, and had been married for 30 years – but it didn’t occur to me to say my wife. I knew immediately that the love of my life was Lily, a woman who had left me broken-hearted in my 20s. Lily and I hadn’t spoken since the day she left me, in 1982 – and I’d forbidden myself from looking her up online because I was protecting myself from pain. But when I got home from the pub, I decided to take the plunge. I sent Lily a Facebook message. I didn’t say, “I’ve loved you every day for the last 40 years,” because I didn’t want to seem mad. But truthfully, I had.Lily replied about 60 seconds after I pressed send, and after that, it was as if the floodgates had opened. Some nights I didn’t sleep a wink because I was up until dawn, messaging her. The first time we met in person, it was as if the last four decades just melted away. We spent the night in a hotel, and every touch felt so instinctual. The strangest thing was that I discovered our lives were like mirror images: like me, Lily was married but it was sexless. My wife and I hadn’t had sex for 15 years and were living like housemates, and it was the same for Lily and her husband.My wife had decided to ignore our affair; her wish is to stay married because it’s easier practically and financiallyFor the past two years, we have been meeting once a month, but I want more. We’ve both told our spouses, so our affair is out in the open. My wife has decided to ignore it; her wish is to stay married because it’s easier financially and practically. I want to live with Lily and make our relationship official, but she finds the leap into the unknown difficult. I understand that fear of it all going wrong and being left with nothing. If that happens at the age of 25, you pick yourself up, dust yourself down and start again. But at 65, it’s much tougher.It’s painful, because Lily is all I’ve ever wanted – she is my favourite thing. To strike out and spend the rest of our lives together would be the most cracking adventure. But I’ve resigned myself to this, and I can live with it, so long as Lily remains in my life. Once a month will have to be enough – so long as I still get to see her.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

I was young and superficial. I remember thinking his look was a bit uncool and very 70s, and I wanted to embrace the 80s. I thought I’d experience many loves just as intense as what I felt for him, but I was wrong. Since I left Nick, I haven’t been able to sustain desire for any man. In my mid-20s, I developed a pattern: six months in, I’d start feeling revolted by the idea of sex with my new boyfriend. I haven’t had sex with my husband for 13 years.When Nick sent that first Facebook message, it was such a thrill. Within days it was clear that we had to get back together. I was nervous about meeting up in the flesh because we have both changed so much. I was a bit shocked by his bald head at first, as I remember him with flowing locks, but he felt just the same. I didn’t want him to see my 60-year-old body. I tried to turn off the light in the hotel room, but he wasn’t having that. Being in bed with him again was total bliss. I’ve not had an orgasm during sex since 1982, when we broke up.How do you walk out of a marriage after 32 years? My husband and I are very close. The marriage is passionless but not lovelessI confessed to my husband early on, and his policy seems to be to pretend the affair doesn’t exist. Things have never been very romantic between us. But how do you walk out of a marriage after 32 years? My husband and I are very close. The marriage is passionless but not loveless. I don’t want to upset my daughter, who knows nothing about this. She’s 30 so it wouldn’t devastate her, but I feel overwhelmed by anxiety at the thought of hurting her. It all feels too late. At 64, I have too much fear to abandon the life I have made.And what if Nick and I don’t get on as an official couple? I love him deeply, but sometimes I wonder whether our passion would fade if we lived together. Perhaps my six-month-curse would kick in and I’d stop desiring him. I feel guilty because I know Nick wants more, but I think it’s better to continue as we are. That way, we preserve the love we have.Explore more on these topicsSexThis is how we do itRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The mistake was understandable enough: high on the euphoria of beatingManchester City in the FA Cup final, Manchester United renewed his contract. Three months into the new season, more than £180m spent on summer transfers,Ten Hag was dismissedwith United 14th in the table on 11 points from nine games.The sporting director, Dan Ashworth, and various members of Ten Hag’s backroom staff also left, at a total cost of £14.5m. Or, to put it another way, keeping Ten Hag cost United £200m and in effect undermined this season. Nobody wants to be caught in the Ten Hag trap.Manchester United’s crazy comeback was inspirational – and a reality checkRead moreNo two cases are ever exactly alike. There is a tendency always to overcorrect on a simplistic understanding of what went before, which is why so many clubs flip-flop between idealistic dreamers and dour pragmatists – the fat pope, thin pope model of history.Even by United’s recent standards, the decision to stick with Ten Hag was bungled: openly talking to other candidates inevitably erodes confidence in the incumbent. But, equally, every club owner or director is aware of the Ten Hag trap and the need to avoid it. For a few years yet it’s going to be harder for a manager to save their job by winning a trophy and that is of direct relevance to bothAnge Postecoglouand Ruben Amorim.The threat to Amorim is, as yet, theoretical, although as the example of Sir Ben Ainsliewith Ineos’s sailing teamdemonstrates, Sir Jim Ratcliffe has a capacity to be ruthless. He will dismiss a high-profile figure just as readily as he will scrap a packed lunch, stewards’ bonus or pensioner concession. The case against Amorim, anyway, is largely that his football is not a fit for the squad and it would be cheaper and easier to replace the ideologue in the dugout than an entire dressing room of players.The ecstatic end toThursday’s Europa League quarter-finalagainst Lyon bolsters his position. As Rory McIlroy’svictory at the Masterslast Sunday showed, sport is at its best when it blends the anxious and hapless with the brilliant to produce an impossibly dramatic denouement. Those final minutes at Old Trafford, Kobbie Mainoo and Harry Maguire cast into emergency service as central forwards and both producing exceptional finishes, will be remembered for decades in the way a routine 2-0 win simply wouldn’t have been. Fans will forgive a lot of frustration for an experience like that –even if it is dependent on fallibility.View image in fullscreenEuphoric scenes at Old Trafford after Harry Maguire’s winning goal against Lyon.Photograph: Matt West/ShutterstockIn that sense, Thursday’s win could be for Amorim whatLiverpool’s 4-3 victory over Borussia Dortmundwas in the Europa League quarter-final in 2016, a game that did not lead to immediate success but did act as confirmation of the Jürgen Klopp project. The only caveat is that, for United, much the same could be said about the4-3 win over Liverpoolin the FA Cup quarter-final last season, and it turned out Amad Diallo’s extra-time winner was simply a lure on the way into the Ten Hag trap.The case of Postecoglou is more perilous. It is entirely plausible that Tottenham win the Europa League and the Australian still leaves the club, while United stick with Amorim having won nothing. But Thursday was a good night for Postecoglou, Tottenham’s most impressive away performance since the4-0 win at Manchester Cityin November. It’s perhaps not ideal that their idea of defending is apparently reliant on having a player with the freakish pace of Micky van de Ven but, on the other hand, they do, at the moment, have a player with the freakish pace of Micky van de Ven.The difficulty ofwinning at Deutsche Bank Parkshould not be underestimated – Spurs were only the fourth away side to do so this season of 21 who have tried – but equally Tottenham’s annual expenditure on wages is around three times that of Eintracht Frankfurt. That is no guarantee of success, but it does fit the theory that Postecoglou’s ultra-aggressive football works when, as in Scotland with Celtic, his side has an advantage of resource. That superiority will be even more pronounced in the semi-final against Bodø/Glimt.That shouldn’t devalue any success Tottenham may have, but it does perhaps place it into context. It is possible to mount a defence of Postecoglou on the grounds that injuries, particularly to the back four, ripped the heart out of the season, damaging confidence, and that, by the time a measure of stability was regained, the league campaign was already meaningless. But it’s also true that once the opening 10-game spurt was over, there has been little evidence of him having an aptitude for the Premier League.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It may even be that the best thing for a manager wanting a lengthy career at Tottenham is a very specific form of failure, one that prioritises Champions League qualification and its budgetary benefits over the more tangible achievement of trophies.Perhaps that is simply, once again, to point out the twin impulses that guide football and the friction that exists between them: routine wins and control may offer consistency and please the executives, but the visceral stirrings that animate fans come from nights such as Thursday at Old Trafford, the sort of nonsense and drama that scorns careful financial projections, or, indeed, any sort of planning at all.Executives will always favour reliability. Nobody ever built a successful business on unlikely players doing unlikely things at unlikely times; fans may delight in the flailing limbs of three goals after the 114th minute, but they mean less to the bottom line than consistency. And that is all the more pertinent given how aware everybody is of the need to avoid the Ten Hag trap.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedInside footballRuben AmorimAnge PostecoglouTottenham HotspurAustralia sportcommentShareReuse this content"

Eleven months on, he is poised to mark his first season as Liverpool’s head coach by becoming a Premier League champion and could seal the trophy by defeating a PSV and Manchester United legend, Ruud van Nistelrooy, and confirming Leicester’s relegation.Thoughts of spite will not enter Slot’s mind, however. He has been reserved since arriving at Anfield, but fans would revel in completing a merited title triumph at the King Power on Sunday. The added needle is much needed because Liverpool’s superiority has made the title race tedious. Others are to blame for that.Slot denies Liverpool dropped Darwin Núñez due to row at training groundRead moreThe advantage over second-placed Arsenal is 13 points with six games remaining. A defeat for the Gunners at Ipswich on Sunday followed by a Liverpool win would allow Slot to plan his outfit for the open-top bus parade. Considering his side’s 100% record against the bottom three – of five wins, 15 goals scored and five conceded – no one will be panicking at playing doomed Leicester.Despite the failings of those heading down and the gap at the top, Liverpool’s success and consistency should not be underestimated. Slot is adamant English football is the world’s best, prompting him to run through some of the season’s difficult games. “Wolves at home, even Southampton at home, Plymouth away, which is not even at Premier League level,” he says, before mentioning this month’sdefeat at Fulham.Smaller clubs are less competitive in the Dutch top division, he says. “It’s not only the Eredivisie. You see this in Spain, you see this in Italy. Multiple managers have said something about that.”Liverpool needed a late winner tobeat West Ham last Sunday. “They have players that can play for us and you don’t see that in the Italian league, you don’t see this in the Spanish league, you don’t see this in the Eredivisie,” Slot says. “You only see this in the Premier League and that’s why it’s such a popular league. That’s why people pay so much money, broadcasters, and that’s why we can bring so many good players in.”This season’s finest team do not have the style of a peak Pep Guardiola side, but they set the standard early with unfussy 2-0 wins over Ipswich and Brentford. The spectacular form of Mohamed Salah has helped Liverpool sit top since 2 November and despite the odd flirtation from chasers they have never looked like losing their grip on first place thanks to ruthless efficiency.View image in fullscreenArne Slot puts his squad through their paces on Friday.Photograph: Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesConcerns that Virgil van Dijk, Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold would leave for nothing this summer grew throughout the season, but provided no on-field distraction. This monththe DutchmanandEgyptian committed to Liverpoolbut the England defender will almost certainlypack his bags for the Bernabéu. Van Dijk did plenty of badge kissing and it did not feel performative; he always wanted to stay because life does not get better than being top of the league.The experience of Van Dijk and Salah has been key and they deserve the right to lift the trophy without contractual shadows over them. It would have been bittersweet for Liverpool to win the league and lose three men who have contributed so much over the past eight years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last Saturday’sdraw against Brightonbrought their first point and league goals since late January. Slot should be able to head home to the Netherlands after the match for a two-day break a joyful man, even if the title has to wait.He has not planned how he will celebrate securing Liverpool’s record-equalling 20th championship. “I’m only thinking about trying to win a game of football against Leicester,” he says. Others might not be believed, but Slot has never let his focus drift. Only when mathematically guaranteed will he truly enjoy himself.Supporters, players and coaches generally want to complete the job on home turf, but if that is not to be the case for Liverpool – who could also win the title on Wednesday without playing, when Arsenal host Crystal Palace – they will be placated if things are done and dusted early. There have been two league defeats, somewhat surprisingly against Nottingham Forest as well as Fulham. Liverpool cruised past Manchester City in two fixtures, making them look a shadow of the one that twice edged Jürgen Klopp’s heavy metal band into second.Months of hard work has alleviated the pressure. “The only thing I care about is the league table,” Slot says. “I like to look at it at the moment and I hope I can still like to look at it in one, two, three, four, five or six games.” The time for worry will soon be over.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolThe ObserverArne SlotfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At a boisterous, increasingly gleeful Villa Park Unai Emery’s side moved up to sixth in thePremier Leaguewith a relentless dismantling of Newcastle, who simply fell away in the second half, conceding three goals in the final 20 minutes of a chastening 4-1 defeat.Newcastle remain in third and fought hard in the opening hour, after which life just seemed to catch up with them, Villa’s squad depth apparent as Emery shuffled his attacking substitutes with notable precision.O’Reilly and Kovacic sink Everton to boost Manchester City’s top-five hopesRead moreThe stadium was chilly and grey at kick-off, the air hazed with the after-burn of some surprisingly aggressive pre-match smoke geysers. This was one of the most jeopardy-ridden occasions of the Premier League’s end game, a top five face-off, third versus seventh, both clubs hungry for what has now become a key stream of ready cash in the age of profitability and sustainability rules plus pumped‑up Uefa revenues.Newcastle came here with an unchanged team and on a wrecking ball run of form, six straight wins, Harvey Barnes and Jacob Murphy leaving scorch marks on the flanks. In Eddie Howe’s absence Jason Tindall has offered a kind of hype-man leadership model. Bez has taken the mic, and at the best possible moment, with a team running on adrenaline.The real rock of Howe’s Newcastle is still its murder-ball midfield, which is designed to leave you bruised and breathless, to make every moment in that shared pocket of space an ordeal. Unai Emery stiffened his team here in response. Tyrone Mings for Pau Torres was a direct beefing up. Ollie Watkins was back in the XI, Marcus Rashford on the bench.Villa had played a suicidally high line against Newcastle in the5-1 defeat last season. Emery loves to tinker with the margins from game to game. The sense here was the home team would start a little deeper.Or not. It took 33 seconds for Villa to take the lead with a thrust down the left. Youri Tielemans picked up Sandro Tonali’s floated clearance and played an instant pass in to Watkins. He chopped inside and saw his shot deflected into the corner. It was Watkins’ first goal here since February.Four minutes later he hit the bar from almost the same spot after weaving unhindered through the right of the defence. But steadily Newcastle settled, Tonali grooving about in possession. There were some juddering early collisions. Dan Burn seemed to spend most of the opening 15 minutes splayed across the turf, hurling himself into assorted lunges and body-checks.View image in fullscreenAston Villa’s Ollie Watkins (centre) celebrates scoring the opening goal against Newcastle.Photograph: David Davies/PAAnd with 17 minutes gone Newcastle were level. It came from a free-kick into the Villa box, headed clear and picked up by Barnes on the right, who crossed deep for Fabian Schär to hover and power a header into the net.Quick! Back down the other end! Almost immediately Ian Maatsen found space on the Newcastle right and crossed for Marco Asensio to miss his kick in front of goal, a precision missed-kick, side-foot, eyes over the ball, just the faintest of sliced contacts. With 26 minutes gone Watkins hit the woodwork again, the same side, this time with a free header from a free-kick. He really should have scored.And so it went on, a series of surges from end to end. Tonali drew a fine full length save from Emi Martínez. Nick Pope palmed away a drive from Morgan Rogers, then scrambled the resultant corner out off his knees. Half-time came at a breathless pace, the score somehow still only 1-1.It was more of the same after the break. John McGinn, such a fine ­comfortable chair of a ­midfielder, saw more of the ball in his ­playmaking role.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tielemans was also having a fine game, ­counterpressing well in the clinches around the Newcastle box, something Emery has brought out of his game.With an hour gone Pope made a good save from McGinn, rushing to edge of his box and blocking with an outstretched arm.Villa deservedly took the lead again on 63 minutes with a fine goal, a quick break from midfield fed to Watkins who released Maatsen into space outside him. He didn’t break his stride, running on and clipping a lovely finish past Pope into the far corner. The Holte End erupted, Emery whirled and punched the air on his touchline, Zorro-like all in black.With 20 minutes to go Jacob Ramsey and Amadou Onana came on, a weary looking McGinn coming off. And Villa scored almost instantly, again from the left, this time a cross from Ramsey, turned into his own goal by Burn in a tangle of feet. At which point the other sub abruptly made it four, Onana smashing a shot high into the net after Pope had saved from Rogers. It was a brilliant finish, and a supreme pair of substitutions from Emery.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Villa kept pressing.

The rampant display set up the possibility of a record score against Scotland, which stands at an 89-0 thrashing in the 2011 Six Nations, but they could not produce the same rapid fire scoring in the second half to write a new page in the history books. They did, however, seal the team’s 33rd consecutive win in the tournament with a 59-7 victory.England squad depth is ‘giving me a headache’, says head coach MitchellRead moreThe Red Roses were heavy favourites heading into the match as Scotland have never beaten England in the tournament, with their last win across all competitions against their rivals coming in 1999.For this fixture, Mitchell made nine changes and among them was the former captain Marlie Packer. Before the Six Nations began, Packer was stripped of the captaincy because of the depth of options in her position of openside flanker. Mitchell wanted the flexibility to start other players ahead of Packer and so gave the title to one of the first names on the team sheet every game in Zoe Aldcroft. The change has resulted in Packer, who is now vice-captain, being in and out of the team this tournament.Packer started England’s gameagainst Italy in round onebut was dropped out of the match-day 23 for the Wales and Ireland fixtures. The Saracens player was once again named as a starter for Saturday’s game and it could be said she had something to prove with players such as Sadia Kabeya and Abi Burton the competition for her shirt. Packer put in a solid performance and scored her 50th try for her country on her 110th appearance. But she may not have done enough to retain the shirt for the grand slam decider next weekend.View image in fullscreenClaudia MacDonald celebrates scoring a try during the Red Roses’ emphatic win.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAThe fixture was also the first time Holly Aitchison had played at fly-half all tournament with Helena Rowland and Zoe Harrison given the nod in the opening three games. Aitchison proved her worth in the 10 shirt with a hugely improved kicking game, successfully kicking seven of nine conversions. The wing Claudia MacDonald also had a brilliant game, crossing for two tries and proving a menace for the Scottish defence.Rain lashed down as the game got under way with a huge scrum where the Red Roses decimated Scotland’s set piece.Quick GuideItaly 21-34 FranceShowFrance produced a second-half fightback to beat Italy 34-21 and maintain their 100% record in the Women’s Six Nations, setting up a potential grand slam decider against England.Joanna Grisez’s early try had given France a flying start in Parma, but after the France lock Madoussou Fall was sent to the sin-bin for a high tackle, Italy recovered to lead 21-12 at half-time thanks to tries from Vittoria Vecchini, Aura Muzzo and Silvia Turani. Morgane Bourgeois also touched down for the visitors.France rallied in the second half, going on to secure a bonus point after tries from the sisters Romane Ménager and Marine Ménager before the replacement Alexandra Chambon went over in the last minute.Les Bleuesare now set for a potential winner-takes-all showdown away to England on 26 April.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The 15,530 strong crowd were loud and dominated by England supporters – during the national anthems the Scottish players’ voices could be heard from the stands. The Red Roses fans made their presence known during an early break from Abby Dow and then reached another level when Kelsey Clifford crashed over for the opening try. With the score, the sun came out and it brought a positive spell for Scotland but it was the hosts who were next to score.Packer went over for a try which moved her one ahead of Rory Underwood, the top try-scorer for England’s men’s team.

But before they were deployed England stretched their lead further. MacDonald finished off a lovely team try – something that is becoming a signature move from this side – and Scotland grabbed a consolation score through Lisa Thomson. The game’s pace slowed considerably in the final stages but England had the last say with two brilliant tries from Dow.If England lift the trophy next weekend they will equal their own record for the longest streak of winning the Six Nations.

Wilson is now the 20th man on that list afterhis defence came to a shuddering haltwithin hours of this year’s tournament beginning, after the world No 39 produced a magnificent comeback victory.Kyren Wilson: ‘It’s not just me that’s world champion. It’s my whole family’Read moreWilson led Lei 6-3 after the opening session on Saturday but crucially, it was Lei who won the final frame in the morning to ensure the deficit was just three frames, rather than five. The 21-year-old then won six successive frames to start the evening session, all with breaks of 50 or more, to move to the verge of victory.Wilson returned serve with a clearance of 106 and edged two more nerve-shredding frames to send it to a decider. At that stage, all the momentum seemed to be with the champion. But Lei held his nerve to deliver a break of 66 and close out one of the biggest shocks in the Crucible’s recent history.As well as that, he ensured the curse would continue for at least another year as well as, more importantly, raising hopes even further that Chinese snooker may be on the verge of what it has craved for some time.The hopes of a nation have largely rested on the shoulders of Ding Junhui for quite some time, and when 10 Chinese players were suspended as part of a match-fixing investigation in 2023, it left the sport under a dark cloud. However, a record 10 players – almost a third of the draw – from China have qualified for this year’s tournament.Such is the spread throughout that draw too, that it seems incredibly likely that at least two will meet in the quarter-finals. Xiao Guodong led Matthew Selt 7-2 after their opening session. And while Lei stole the show and the headlines on the opening day here, all eyes on Sunday will be on one of the brightest hopes Chinese snooker has ever seen.View image in fullscreenLei Peifan produced a huge upset on the first day of the world championship when he defeated Kyren Wilson 10-9.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PAZhao Xintong was one of the 10 playersbanned in 2023, serving a 20-month suspension for his part in the scandal. But he has been tipped for stardom from a young age, and has returned to the amateur tour since the expiration of his ban in some style, making a maximum break and coming through qualifying to reach the Crucible.He is only the third non-professional to reach the main draw. He begins against last year’s finalist, Jak Jones, and will now meet Lei in the last 16 if he navigates that task. Many within the sport believe Zhao is best placed to become China’s first world champion, including the great Stephen Hendry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Crucible was a marvellous sight on Saturday; the history seeps from the walls and the surrounding areas are a hive of activity. Few sports are as synonymous with one city quite like Sheffield is with snooker.But there is no doubting the Crucible has its limitations, and talk of moving the world championship is never far from the agenda. With the tournament’s current deal up in 2027, should a Chinese player finally win the game’s biggest prize over the coming fortnight, who knows where it could lead, with the tournament watched by as many as 200 million people in China.Whether Lei is the man to do that, or one of the other players from China in action at this tournament, remains to be seen. But this victory was a statement moment so early into proceedings in Sheffield: not just for the continuation of the curse, but the belief that after so long, maybe this is Chinese snooker’s time.Explore more on these topicsWorld Snooker ChampionshipThe ObserverSnookernewsShareReuse this content"

His own summation in the moments after the crash summed it up as he bluntly described himself as a “fucking idiot” over team radio.The pressure is intense this season, Norris in a nip-and-tuck fight with Piastri and Verstappen where every mistake could be crucial, as he leads Piastri by three points with Verstappen eight points back in third. Starting from 10th on Sunday his title lead is hanging by the slenderest of threads and his self-belief perhaps once more undermined.Saudi Arabian GP: Verstappen takes pole after Norris hits wall in F1 qualifying – liveRead more“I’m not going to be proud, I’m not going to be happy. I’ve let myself down and let the team down,” he said. Understandably dejected he then held his hands up and played down his chances of a comeback on Sunday.“I’m just disappointed with today. I will go see my engineers and apologise,” he said. “See what we can do tomorrow, we need a bit of luck, it’s almost impossible to overtake around here so I’m not expecting anything magical, if I can make the top five or six I would be happy.”McLaren and indeed Norris had looked strong all weekend but on the first of the final runs in Q3 at the Jeddah circuit he took too much kerb through turns four, five and six and it launched him into the wall, taking a nasty hit on the front from which he emerged unhurt but was clearly enormously disappointed in himself.In stark contrast, qualifying was marked by a buoyant and resurgent Verstappen in aRed Bullthat was proving far more to the world champion’s liking than the recalcitrant beast he had wrestled with last week. He set the pole with a blistering final lap in Q3 for 1min 27.294sec, threading the needle in a tense session with an attacking assurance that was a reminder of just how quick he can be when he has confidence in his ride.His team were also exemplary pulling a bold strategic move in having Verstappen complete two laps after the red flag caused by Norris’s crash; fuelled for two he took the first as a very strong sighter and nailed the final circuit.Verstappen was hugely pleased with the result, the pole going no little way at least to ease the tension at Red Bull. The Dutchman had been deeply dissatisfied after managing only sixth at thelast round in Bahrainwith a car that lacked balance and pace.He was blunt that he did not believe he could compete for the title as things stood and the team held discussions after that race to consider how best to address the issues.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen capitalised on Lando Norris’s error.Photograph: Thaier Al-Sudani/ReutersThe somewhat mercurial car can, however, be adapted over a race weekend successfully, as theyproved at Suzukaand once more they did very well to coax it into a peak operating window in Jeddah.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To return pole given how strong the McLarens were will be considered a huge result by the world champion and at Milton Keynes.In the wake of Bahrain questions were again raised about Verstappen’s future at the team, with Red Bull’s motorsport advisor, Helmut Marko, stating there was “great concern” he could leave. It prompted Verstappen to dismiss the issue this weekend and this performance will quieten the furore in the short term at least.For Norris this was another real setback. The team have been looking at how to adjust the car to accommodate him better but it was an ongoing process not expected to yield an immediate turnaround. He had looked very comfortable in Jeddah however and was in position to challenge for pole until he lost it and was punished on a track where any error is costly.Mercedes’ George Russell did superbly to claim a strong third place, Charles Leclerc was fourth for Ferrari and Kimi Antonelli in fifth for Mercedes. Lewis Hamilton once more struggled with his Ferrari, managing only seventh place, almost a second off the pole time.Carlos Sainz was sixth for Williams, Yuki Tsunoda in eighth for Red Bull and Pierre Gasly in ninth for Alpine,Alex Albon was in 11th for Williams, Liam Lawson and Isack Hadjar in 12th and 14th for Racing Bulls, Fernando Alonso in 13th for Aston Martin and Ollie Bearman in 15th for Haas.Lance Stroll was in 16th for Aston Martin, Jack Doohan 17th for Alpine, Nico Hülkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto in 18th and 20th for Sauber and Esteban Ocon 19th for Haas.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneThe ObserverMotor sportMcLarenLando NorrisMax VerstappenRed BullnewsShareReuse this content"

The Spanish forward then stunned the home fans when he scored two more goals in the second half, twice racing through to beat the keeper on his way to a hat-trick.However, Barça’s Dani Olmo and Raphinha soon netted four minutes apart to draw level at 3-3. Celta held on for almost half an hour but conceded a late penalty for a foul on Olmo which was awarded after a check by the video assistant referee, with Raphinha stepping up to fire the ball into the top corner in the 98th minute.“This is football. We wanted to win this game but we weren’t always at our best. But the team came through in the end and the crowd pushed us on right to the finish,” Barça substitute and goalscorer Olmo told Dazn. “It’s three points towards our objective but we have to keep going.”PosTeamPGDPts1Barcelona3256732Real Madrid3133663Atletico Madrid3127634Athletic Bilbao3124575Villarreal301351Madrid will seek to return Barcelona’s advantage to four points when they host Athletic Bilbao on Sunday night.“It’s a bittersweet feeling because we did a lot of things right.

They’re capable of these things,” Celta’s Pablo Durán said. “We should be very proud of ourselves, coming here and showing a lot of character, playing our football. For a lot of the game we were better than them, but we go away with a bad feeling because of the result.”Barcelona will be sweating over Robert Lewandowski’s fitness after the Polish striker went down clutching his leg and was taken off late in the game. A hamstring injury may rule the 36-year-old – who has 40 goals this season – out of their Copa del Rey final next weekend against Real Madrid while Barcelona also face Inter in the Champions League semi-finals this month.“Lewandowski will have an MRI tomorrow. We have to wait for the results, we’ll know more about his injury,” Flick said.Javi Muñoz scored a stoppage-time winner to earn relegation-threatenedLas Palmasa shock 1-0 victory overAtlético Madridlater on Saturday, dealing a major blow to the visitors’ slimLa Ligatitle hopes.Diego Simeone’s side remain third in the standings with 63 points, three behind second-placed Real Madrid, who host Athletic Bilbao on Sunday.Both sides had chances to break the deadlock before half-time, with Las Palmas coming close through a close-range header from Álex Suárez and a Dário Essugo effort that went just wide. At the other end, Dinko Horkas produced sharp saves to deny Julián Alvarez and Alexander Sørloth.In a slower-paced second half, Atlético dominated possession but were unable to create clear scoring chances against a disciplined defence from the hosts. Seconds before the match ended in a goalless draw, Muñoz capitalised on sloppy defending by Atlético, who failed to clear the ball, allowing the midfielder to shoot from close range and finally beat goalkeeper Jan Oblak. The goal was initially ruled out for offside, but a VAR review overturned the decision three minutes into stoppage time, sparking wild celebrations at the Estadio Gran Canaria.“It was a tough match, a defeat we have to put behind us and move on. But today is tough,” Atlético defender Robin Le Normand told Movistar. “It’s clear that every point is important. Beyond fighting for the title, we wanted to play a very good match ... They didn’t create much, but they’re playing for salvation, fighting for every ball. We didn’t get it right.”The surprising victory allowed Las Palmas to climb to 17th place and temporarily escape the drop zone with 32 points, two ahead of Alavés, who play at Sevilla on Sunday.“I was certain that I wasn’t offside. When I saw that the ball was dead, I went to take advantage of the play,” Muñoz said. “There’s a lot of fighting left but we’re going to fight until the end. Let’s enjoy the victory and hope it helps us to keep believing that the team can do it.”In GermanyBayern Munichhad little trouble beating lowlyHeidenheim4-0 to put themselves within touching distance of the Bundesliga title. The table now shows Bayern at the top with 72 points, nine clear of Bayer Leverkusen who face St Pauli on Sunday, with four rounds left to play.With Bayern racing into a three-goal lead after just 36 minutes – courtesy of Harry Kane’, Konrad Laimer and Kingsley Coman – there was little doubt about the outcome. Joshua Kimmich then rifled a shot home for 4-0 in the 56th minute as Bayern surged ahead at full throttle in their pursuit of another league crown.Heidenheim, fuelled by pride and eager to salvage something from an otherwise dismal performance, came close to pulling back a goal just after the hour mark. But Bayern keeper Jonas Urbig was sharp and alert, diving low to deny Sirlord Conteh with a smart save. For the hosts, the situation looks bleak: they are third from bottom in the relegation playoff places with 22 points, seven behind St Pauli, who occupy the last safe spot.View image in fullscreenHarry Kane celebrates after the match.Photograph: Heiko Becker/ReutersIn Serie A a second-half header by Scott McTominay securedNapolia 1-0 win at relegation-threatenedMonzaas Antonio Conte’s side provisionally moved level with leaders Inter.McTominay nodded home to put Napoli in front in the 72nd minute, scoring from a lovely lofted cross from the corner of the area by Giacomo Raspadori.Second-placed Napoli are level with Inter on 71 points from 33 games, before the defending champions travel to Bologna on Sunday. Monza sit bottom with 15 points, 11 points from safety.Ligue 1 championsParis Saint-Germaincontinued their quest to become the only team in the French top flight to remain unbeaten throughout a season with a routine 2-1 home win overLe Havre. Luis Enrique, with the title win wrapped up two weeks ago, made nine changes from the side that advanced to the Champions League semi-finals in midweek despite losing the second leg against Aston Villa.The hosts took the lead in the eighth minute when Bradley Barcola rolled a pass into the box to Désiré Doué whose control took him past his marker before he hit a shot that took a deflection on its way to the net.Le Havre were completely outplayed in the first half and were relieved to go into the break just one goal down but PSG doubled their lead five minutes after the interval. After some intricate close passing around the opposition area, Senny Mayulu dinked the ball over onrushing keeper Mathieu Gorgelin leaving Gonçalo Ramos with the simplest of tap-ins from close range. The visitors pulled one goal back on the hour mark through Issa Soumaré’s header from a corner kick move but were unable to muster another chance on target as treble-chasing PSG earned their 10th consecutive league win.Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballThe ObserverLa LigaBarcelonaCelta VigoBundesligaBayern MunichHeidenheimnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s wealthPhillip InmanAnalysts trace a link between financial security and a troubling, increasingly devil-may-care, attitude to political riskSat 19 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Apr 2025 10.54 EDTShareSteve Coogan wants ­people to see his new film,The Penguin Lessons, and think about how they might be living in a wealthy cocoon, disengaged from the world.The film’s central character – a Briton teaching expat children in Argentina – rescues a penguin and tries to help local people persecuted by the rightwing government. Re-enacting a true story, Coogan is showing how it’s possible to be involved in local communities even when the protagonist is an outsider.Coogan is concerned about a political shift to the right built on a more selfish outlook, one that focuses on close family and casts a cold eye on people less fortunate. We see it in the US, in therise of Reform in the UK, and in France and Germany. In the UK, local elections next month will be an opportunity to see if Reform is gaining ground.It’s clear that a large and growing group of voters support rightwing candidates, and increasingly those from the far right, who promise to cut taxes, scrap regulations, reduce immigration and protect a singular freedom – “the freedom to spend your own money as you wish”, whether from a salary or drawing on family wealth.To Make America/Britain/France/Germany great again, policies become ever more outlandish, without any apparent concern for the often terrible side effects.We saw this in the act of economic delusion carried out byLiz Truss in 2022,and we are witnessing it now in the White House. Worse could be to come in the UK should Reform and the National Rally in France and AfD in Germany gain the level of votes needed to influence, if not control, the state.Political scientists have been tracing the link for some time between financial security and an almost revolutionary, devil-may-care spirit in a growing number of voters.This new social contract is one between the better-off baby boomer and the state, which agrees to keep the poor behind high walls and out of sightAs transformations go, it is a radical shift, and explains the disappearance of political groups like the home counties liberal Conservative – those who put the rule of law, a mixed economy and community spirit near the top of their wish list. They will be replaced by legions of well-heeled suburban voters in big metropolitan areas who rarely read or listen to news bulletins and care more about being left alone, especially by the government.It brings about a different kind of social contract. Not the one that ties the rich to the poor because the rich understand everyone is better off if the poorest are raised up and given opportunities. That was the inclusive postwar capitalism that gave baby boomers all their advantages.This new social contract is one between the better-off baby boomer and the state, which agrees to keep the poor behind high walls and out of sight, allowing the affluent to retain their ill-gotten gains from 30 years of house price increases and final salary occupational pensions (conveniently cancelled across the private sector for the next generation).Oxford academics Jane Green and Raluca Pahontu found financial security reduces people’s risk aversion, making them more tolerant of taking large political risks.Ben Ansell, professor of comparative democratic institutions at Nuffield College, Oxford, calls the impulse to vote for radical right policies Fadfo – or “fuck around, don’t find out”. Another Fadfo group votes for radical economic policies because they feel left out by society in some way, “whether it matches to their material circumstances or not”, says Ansell. “It’s about respect and status – or rather the lack of both.”Was Truss the high-water mark for this way of thinking, after millions of people with mortgages found out very quickly the costs of the short-lived prime minister’s revolutionary tactics?Not so fast. Those left worse off were far from being in the Trussian vanguard. They had not supported her or Boris Johnson or Brexit before that. They were, and are, the house-buying millennials, whose higher level of education puts them more in the Labour/Lib Dem/Green camp.Rob Ford, professor of politics at the University of Manchester, says age and education have been the defining characteristics of voters in the last three elections.The younger and better educated a person is, the more likely they are to see themselves as progressive. The opposite is true for those turning rightwards.Ford says it is still true that affluent boomers vote more often than other groups, especially the young.These are depressing messages for Coogan and anyone who is concerned about late-stage capitalism becoming an era when households turn in on themselves – to the benefit of the professional classes and the plutocrats, who get to keep their ill-gotten gains.Maybe the Truss experiment will be a turning point. Trump’s tariffs could be another: a decade when the gamblers and hucksters promising lottery wins for all are shown to be charlatans.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsThe ObserverReform UKLiz TrussNational RallyInequalitycommentShareReuse this content"

For Britain – in our values, our approach and our consistency – we owe it to today’s and future generations to be the port in the storm. Nowhere is that more true than on energy and climate. The decisions we take today will shape not just the years ahead but the generations ahead.That is why it is so important that Keir Starmer set out more than three years ago his mission for Britain to become a clean energy superpower. It is even more relevant and important today than it was back then. And he has rightly shown a resolute determination to stick to it. The argument for a clean power system by 2030 is based on what happened to Britain’s families and businesses following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Our exposure to fossil fuels meant that, as those markets went into meltdown and prices rocketed, family, business and public finances were devastated. The cost of living impacts caused back then still stalk families today.It is because we are determined that Britain is never again exposed in this way that the government sought and won a mandate at the last election for clean power – so we could take back control of our energy. The mission is based on the insight that while oil and gas, including from the North Sea, will remain an important part of our energy system for some time to come, clean homegrown power is the only route to true energy security.So the argument for the clean energy transition is not just the traditional climate case but the social justice case too – it is working people who pay the greatest price for our energy insecurity. There can be no national security without energy security, and dependence on fossil fuels has left us at the mercy of global markets we do not control.The case for our mission is also about the enormous economic opportunity there is for Britain. According to the CBI, thenet zero economy grew three times faster than the economy as a wholelast year – and already, since the general election, more than £43bn of private investment has been pledged for our clean power mission, creating thousands of jobs across the country. But this is just the start of what we can achieve.View image in fullscreen‘Not too much clean energy but too little’ … a worker at one of the blast furnaces at British Steel’s Scunthorpe site.Photograph: Darren Staples/APMore than ever at this moment, investors are looking for safety and security because the biggest enemy of private investment is uncertainty. Britain offers that certainty. Because of the clarity of our mission, we have been able to drive forward with sweeping reforms to the planning system to speed up clean-power projects and a wholesale revolution in our process of connecting clean energy to the grid, ending the years of failure by the last government which have led to decade-long delays.Our plan for change is also not just about breaking down the barriers to investment but about offering the muscular industrial policy that is essential in this new and changing world. This is a government that cares about ensuring that we make, buy and sell things in our country. Take steel – the prime minister did not hesitate to act in the national interest to protect the steel industry. This determination is also clear from the new institutions this government has established since the election.The National Wealth Fund is the government’s clean energy financier and Great BritishEnergyis the government’s publicly owned clean energy company. They are built on a clear proposition: to use public investment to crowd in private investment so we can create the energy generation and supply chains for clean energy in Britain, ensuring more good, unionised jobs at good wages. They are making a real difference already – with 200 schools and 200 hospitals about to get lower energy bills because of Great British Energy.For all these reasons, we are doubling down on our agenda. Yes, there are siren voices that want to knock us off course. They would keep Britain locked in dependence on global markets we don’t control. They will also make up any old nonsense and lies to pursue their ideological agenda, the latest example being their attempt to use the crisis facing the steel industry for their deeply damaging agenda.UK Steel says that it is the “UK’s reliance on natural gas power generation” that leaves us with higher prices than international allies—not too much clean energy, but too little. The same dependence that has hit families has hit industry too.With their insistence on the same failed approach that led directly to the cost of living crisis, and which failed the Tories at the last election, the Conservatives and Reform would leave the country exposed and risk further untold damage to businesses and families. They would forfeit the clean energy jobs of the future and sell future generations down the river by simply shrugging their shoulders at the prospect of climate breakdown.So if our political opponents want a fight about clean energy, bring it on. We will take the fight to them and pit cheap homegrown power that we control – and a huge economic opportunity for our country – against the alternative of keeping us locked in the grip of markets we can’t control and economic decline. This Labour government will fight for energy security, lower bills, and good jobs to deliver for people now and for generations to come. And this is a fight we will win.Ed Milibandis Labour MP for Doncaster North and secretary of state for energy security and net zeroExplore more on these topicsEd MilibandOpinionSteel industryEnergyBritish SteelcommentShareReuse this content"

This was achieved not only by supporting more parents into work, but through significantly increasing the generosity of financial support paid by the state to low-income parents. Today, that ambitious New Labour goal to halve child poverty feels like a distant memory as this government looks set to preside over a significant rise over the course of this parliament.That financial support was slashed away by Conservative chancellors from 2010 onwards, meaning that Labour has inherited a tax and benefit system that is far meaner when it comes to children living in financially precarious families. The poorest tenth of families with children lost on average £6,000 a year as a result of tax and benefit changesbetween 2010 and 2024. On top of that, it is the poorest households that have been most sharply affected by the cost of living crisis. This explains why the UK’s child poverty rate rose the fastest of 39 OECD and EU countries between 2012 and 2021, a symptom of the lack of priority and care afforded to poor children by successive Conservative governments and the product of policy choices to cut taxes in a way that disproportionately benefited better-off households rather than protect children from growing up in families where it is a constant struggle to put food on the table and keep homes warm. Almost one in three childrenlive in relative child povertyand one in four in absolute poverty in households with incomes of less than 60% of the median income in 2011, adjusted for inflation.There is only one reliable way to reduce child poverty in an economy characterised by huge numbers of low-paid jobs and stagnating wages, and that is to give low-income parents more money by reversing some of the cuts the Conservatives made to tax credits and benefits. That should have been one of the top fiscal priorities for an incoming Labour government. But nearly a year into its first term, there has been almost nothing of substance forthcoming. Instead, there is just the vague promise of an imminent child poverty strategy by the summer. Even worse,there are plansto cut disability benefits to the extent that some disabled parents stand to lose up to £10,000 a year in the personal independence payment and carer’s allowance. Even before these planned cuts, the forecast was that with no extra support for low-income parents, there would be an extra 400,000 children living in poverty by 2029. If Labour goes ahead with the disability cuts, that number will be even higher.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The suggestion is that they might boost the incomes of low-income parents of babies by around £300 a month, and of toddlers by around £150 a month. But this does not go far enough in terms of lifting children out of poverty, especially when it is part of a set of reforms estimated totake out around £8bna year from disability benefits by 2029.The problem for Labour is that it has constrained itself with self-imposed fiscal rules and manifesto promises when it is prioritising an increase in defence spending. The last Labour government did not face the same trade-off: the economy was growing and tax revenues rising, and so Gordon Brown could channel some of that money into keeping children off the breadline.Rachel Reeves has committedthat public debt should be falling by the end of the forecast period and that day-to-day spending should not exceed revenues. Labour has also hemmed itself in with its manifesto pledge that it would not increase income tax, national insurance or VAT. Together with a grim economic forecast – which is not likely to get rosier against the backdrop of a possible global trade war – this means that there are no resources left to put into meaningfully tackling child poverty.This is desperately short-termist. It should never be acceptable for children in one of the richest countries in the world to have to go without basics. But it also carries long-term costs for the exchequer: growing up in poverty can have far-reaching consequences for these children’s educational, employment and health outcomes in adulthood. So it’s not good enough to say that there’s no money to tackle this. If money can be found for increasing defence spending, it should be found for improving the living standards of our poorest children. If reducing child poverty means raising taxes, it should be a trade-off aLabourgovernment is prepared to make.The biggest risk is not that it loses some votes at the margins because it decided to raise a few billion through income tax. It’s that it never rises above being a government buffeted by circumstance and terrible global headwinds, that it never discovers the agency it takes to spend some political capital on doing the right thing. It’s that when voters go to the polling booth at the next general election, they’re not quite sure what difference a Labour government made.Explore more on these topicsPovertyOpinionRachel ReevesLabourTax and spendingEconomic policyChildreneditorialsShareReuse this content"

But those of a more secular persuasion can also find themselves beguiled by the restorative zeitgeist of this celebratory time of year.In the northern hemisphere it’s spring, with its green shoots and brighter light.

After a harsh southern summer the days finally shorten, the light is beset with a new milkiness, the air assumes a slight crispness and on the east coast at least, north of the New South Wales-Victoria border, the warm ocean currents remain.The long antipodean summer break is a distant memory, the year nearly a third done. We are weary. These few days of Easter are, for many of us, a time to exhale, to stop and be with family and friends.There’s none of the stressful freneticism and consumerism of Christmas, of bolting to the finish line while madly marking full-stops at the end of all those projects before the country shuts down until 26 January.As a kid in Melbourne I hated Good Friday. The most boring day of the year, I would say. The shops were shut. There was nothing on TV (remember, if you’re old enough, that there were but four channels, only free-to-air, and the programming was the Royal Children’s hospital appeal featuring the clownsZig and Zag, or wall-to-wall Christian religious services). There was church, of course. And the prospect of it again on Sunday.Sexy, covetable hot cross buns: Australia’s obsession with Easter treatsRead moreNow it’s my favourite day of the year precisely because so little happens and because it kicks off four days of enforced R & R,of quieter flight paths above and less hectic and noisy roads encircling us.The seasonal change is a delight. It always brings in me a mellowness and a desire to reflect that feels somehow spiritual, profoundly ethereal, albeit in a secular way. I’m not thinking about Jesus or praying to God or anyone else. And yet I find myself in the embrace of some sort of contemplative languor that brings me to the preoccupations of Christians and those of other religions: the existential meaning of it all, the finite nature of time, life – and always death. And, of course, those who are no longer here.I always dwell heavily on notions of fortune at this time of year amid the forced stoppage and the seasonal change that encourages such rumination.It’s the fortune – the pure blind luck – of birth, of being born here, and to be thankful for it. I don’t mean fortune in a self-satisfied, sometimes exclusionary, “this-is-the-best-country-in-the-world’’ kind of way (how that not-so-humble brag wears thin on me in thiselection campaign). No, it’s got nothing to do withpatriotismin any traditional Australian sense. I’m thinking about existential providence, of being delivered to a place whose residents aren’t slaughtered daily by invading armies or beset by famines or being consumed by creeping – or not so creeping – fascism.For all of that, whether through Christian ceremony or a nod to the universe.Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsEasterOpinionAustralian lifestyleReligioncommentShareReuse this content"

Long before the Brothers Grimm gave us Snow White’s usurping queen (and long before Gal Gadot’s toe-curling recent turn in the role), there was Medea, witch of classical myth. Medea is best remembered for killing her own children but, according to Ovid, she went on to acquire a stepson, the hero Theseus, and attempted to kill him too. (Poison, of course, and with an eye on his inheritance: Witchy stepmothering 101.)Two millennia after Ovid, modern women still let our lives be limited by such stories. A new survey says that43% of single mothersare deterred from dating other parents by “negative stereotypes of stepmothers portrayed in popular culture”; 37% explicitly cite the fear that their partners’ children will view them as a “wicked stepmother”. One should approach such a survey with caution – it is commissioned by a dating app for parents – but these findings are mirrored in academic studies the world over. A 2018 survey from New Zealand found that stepmothers altered their behaviour, fearful of setting boundaries with their stepchildren, for fear of the “wicked stepmother” tag.Not even royals are safe from this psychic shadow. When Prince Harry published his memoirSpare, he didn’t quite say, as tabloids claimed, that his father’s wife Camilla had proved a wicked stepmother. What he did say, talking of their first meeting, was: “I recall wondering, right before the tea, if she’d be mean to me. If she’d be like all the wicked stepmothers in storybooks. But she wasn’t.” Plenty of children share Harry’s naive preconceptions, particularly if they’ve grown up on Disney. A study from Anglia Ruskin University, published with last week’s dating survey, assessed 450 hours of classic TV and cinema to find that stepmothers are frequently depicted as “bossy”, “strict”, “neglectful”, “heartless” and “manipulative”.With Snow White, the Grimms introduced a stepmother to an oral tradition that usually featured a monstrous biological motherBlended families are not new. For much of history, given high maternal mortality in childbirth, fathers married a second time in hope of finding a woman to saddle with their existing childcare. Nonetheless, even the most self-sacrificing stepmothers are easy to hate. Forget practical considerations, like the threat a stepmother poses to your inheritance. She’s sleeping with your father. Weird. No wonder stepmothers must be witches. Snow White’s shape-shifting stepmother reveals the classic dichotomy. Only a love potion could have cast a spell on the loins of your benighted Dad; you can see the hag beneath.The good news for stepmothers is that we’re primed to hate our mothers just as much. When the Grimms codified Snow White, they introduced a stepmother to an oral tradition that usually featured a monstrous biological mother. In his 1976 treatise on fairytales,The Uses of Enchantment, the psychologist Bruno Bettelheim argued that the Grimms’ versions took off because their stepmother-heavy adaptations allowed children to physically “split” confused emotions about our biological mothers. Our innate love for a mother is expressed in the idealised, dead woman exemplified by Snow White’s late mother; our conflict with the real-life woman telling us to tidy our rooms by the “stepmother”.Dead woman, good; live woman, bad. So if you’re a mother looking to date, don’t let fear of being a wicked stepmother hold you back. Your partner’s teens can’t hate you more than your own inevitably will.Kate Maltby writes about theatre, politics and cultureskip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Imagine the backlash if he were a womanSat 19 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Apr 2025 19.17 EDTShareElon Musk’s never-ending daddy issuesI regret to inform you that, once again, we are all being forced to think aboutElon Musk’s gonads. Musk, who has had at least 14 children with four women, hasn’t officially launched a new mini-Musk for a while, but theWall Street Journalhas just dropped some disturbing details about the billionaire’s well-publicized breeding fetish.You’ll be familiar with some of these details already. By now we all know that Musk seems to think that the only way to save western civilization is if people like him have as many children as possible. And you’ve probably read the New York Times report which alleges that Musk, who likes preaching what he practices in regards to populating the world, has a habit of wandering around offering hissperm to strangers.What you might not know, however, is that Musk is so committed to this idea of himself as a superhero saving the universe that, even in private conversations, he apparently speaks like he is a character in a poorly written sci-fi novel. According to the Journal, Musk reportedly refers to his children as a “legion” and has been brainstorming ways to breed more efficiently.“To reach legion-level before the apocalypse we will need to use surrogates,” he reportedly said to Ashley St Clair, the mother of one of his children, in a text message seen by the newspaper.Surrogacy can often be a complex ethical issue. Not in this case. Musk appears to view women as nothing more than walking wombs he can use to further his own narcissistic agenda. Ethics aside for a moment, one has to wonder why a man who styles himself as a tech guru can’t figure out a faster way to pop out offspring than surrogacy. At the very least, I’m surprised that Musk hasn’t yet followed the lead of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who reportedly had visions of using his ranch in New Mexico as a base where women would be inseminated with his sperm andgive birth to his babies. But that may come later, I suppose. All the money that Doge, Musk’s pet government project, has cut from libraries andmedical researchmight, at this very moment, be getting funneled into an Official Institute of Accelerated Insemination.While Musk may not have a birthing ranch (yet), he does own a very expensive social network which, according to the Journal, he’s been using to solicit more baby mamas. Musk has apparently been engaging with the cryptocurrency influencer Tiffany Fong on X, sending so many followers her way that she earned $21,000 over a two-week period from the revenue-sharing programs for creators on the platform. Once she was enjoying how lucrative it was to be on his good side, the billionaire asked Fong if she was interested inbirthing his child. You know, as you do. Fong politely declined and Musk swiftly unfollowed her, causing her X-related income to drop.We all know that Musk has very thin skin. How has he responded to the Journal’s embarrassing reporting? Honestly, in an unusually restrained fashion. Nobody has been sent to El Salvador (yet), no reporters have been doxed. Musk has just dismissed the piece as scurrilous gossip. On Tuesday he tweeted “TMZ >> WSJ”. And, in normal circumstances, Musk would be correct that, as long as all parties involved are consenting adults, his private life is no one else’s business. But Musk is not your run-of-the-mill rich guy, is he? I don’t thinkDonald TrumporJD Vancebelieve in very much other than their own advancement. But Musk is an ideologue: he’s inserted himself into the top levels of government and is busy rearranging the US according to his worldview. Understanding all the ins and outs of this worldview is now very much a matter of public interest.It’s also illuminating, I think, to look at the sort of coverage Musk’s shenanigans get, particularly in the conservative press. While people love gawking at Musk, he’s still widely seen as an eccentric genius. Even the headline of the Wall Street Journal piece: “The tactics Elon Musk uses to manage his ‘Legion’ of babies – and their mothers”, seemed to suggest admiration for his multitasking. I’ve offered up thisthought experimentbefore, but just humor me again and imagine a world where a woman acted like Musk. You can’t, can you? She’d be eviscerated on Fox News. There’d be a million thought pieces about what a terrible mother she was. Absolutely nobody would consider her a genius and she certainly wouldn’t be advising the president. There is perhaps no better embodiment of gendered double standards than Musk. And now he’s set on exporting those double standards to Mars.Give Fatima Hassouna a ‘loud death’Being a journalist in Gaza is a death sentence, with Israel apparently set on ensuring a completemedia blackoutof the ongoinggenocide. On Wednesday, days before her wedding,Fatima Hassouna, a young photojournalist who is the subject of a new documentary, became one of the latest journalists to be killed by Israel. A strike on her home killed her along with 10 members of her family, including her pregnant sister. “If I die, I want a loud death,” Hassouna had written on social media. “I don’t want to be just breaking news, or a number in a group, I want a death that the world will hear.”This is what it means to be Palestinian: to have to beg the world to care about you. To have cowards avert your eyes as you are massacred. To have the architects of your annihilationtrot around the worldbeing treated as VIPs by countries that once pretended to care about human rights.Self-identifying ‘hot girls’ are mobilizing to elect a progressive as New York City mayorIfully endorse this.Young women now binge-drink more than young menWhile gen Z may drink less than previous generations, the gender gap in risky drinking has been narrowing. A new study finds that women aged 18-25 are now actually drinking slightly more thanmen the same age.Sudan: two years of war and shameful international neglect“Last week, Amnesty International released anew investigationfinding the Rapid Support Forces committed widespread sexual violence, including rape, gang rape and sexual slavery, amounting to possible crimes against humanity,” Amnesty International’s Erika Guevara Rosas said in astatement marking the two-year anniversaryof the outbreak of Sudan’s civil war. “Despite these atrocities, the world has largely chosen to remain passive. Alarmingly, the UN Security Council has failed to implement a comprehensive arms embargo on Sudan to halt theconstant flow of weaponsfueling these heinous crimes.”A crack in the manosphere: Joe Rogan’s guests are revoltingI chuckled a lot atthis headline.Everyone is making fun of Katy Perry for her little space trip, even Wendy’sThe fast-food chain is refusing to apologize to the singer for a tweet suggesting she should besent back to space.

Thank you for continuing to holdJohn NaughtonNeverending calls to automated customer service lines aren’t just frustrating – new research suggests they may be quietly radicalising as wellSat 19 Apr 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Apr 2025 16.15 EDTShareQuestion: what are the eight most annoying words in the English language? Answer: “Your call is important to us … please hold.” But when you have turned into a gibbering wreck after 10 minutes of your valuable time have ticked away – intermittently punctuated by assurances that, while your tormentor is “experiencing high call volumes at the moment”, nevertheless your call is still important to him/her/it – you can take comfort in the thought that you are not alone. In fact, you belong to the majority of sentient beings in an industrial society like ours.Thanks to a useful piece of market research, we now have an idea of the numbers of victims of this industrial practice – at least in the UK. Asurvey commissioned by the New Britain Projectthinktank found that the average Briton spends between 28 and 41 minutes every week coping with inefficient customer service systems, and that nearly four-fifths of them are frustrated by “the wasted time, the unnecessary friction, and the quiet resignation that has become part of daily interactions with both public and private services”.The survey found that bookingNHSor GP appointments was the most frustrating experience, but contacting local council services, energy suppliers, train companies, broadband suppliers, insurance firms and banks were also high on the annoyance scale.The demographics of sufferers are interesting. Predictably, middle-aged people (35-44) are the most frustrated, but younger people (18-34) also spend a lot of time “on hold”. And, intriguingly, Reform UK supporters seem significantly more frustrated than supporters of other parties – especially when it comes to contacting NHS and council services.This last finding is perhaps the most significant message provided by the survey. It suggests that call fatigue has a political dimension. At any rate, the thinktank that commissioned the survey thinks so. “Voters are increasingly fed up with a system that wastes their time,” it says. “The danger is that this frustration is no longer just background noise, it’s now shaping political behaviour. This isn’t just annoying, it’s political. If ministers don’t fix the systems people deal with every day, they risk losing voters to parties that want to tear the whole system down.”The ‘on hold’ problem is also – perhaps mostly – an excrescence of the private sectorThere’s something in that. Most voters are not interested in politics. They couldn’t give a toss about whether GDP figures are up or down; nor are they exercised about the difference between a recession and a depression. But they do care passionately about some things that are rarely discussed by inhabitants of the Westminster bubble. One is being kept on hold for five minutes while trying to get aGP appointmentmore than a month ahead. Another is thestate of the country’s roads– especially in urban areas where streets are increasingly coming to resemble dried riverbeds.These are public-sector problems for which governments and local authorities have responsibility. But the New Britain Project needs to acknowledge that the “on hold” problem is also (perhaps mostly) an excrescence of the private sector. It’s a creation of a corporate mindset that is happy to sell products or services to people but wants to have as little as possible to do with them afterwards. For many senior executives, customer service is a tiresome and expensive business which involves employing people to deal with the public.The reflex corporate response to this challenge was to outsource the task to call centres, initially located in the UK but later in lower-wage economies overseas. As internet use increased, though, customer service functions were increasingly delegated to websites with which customers could interact. In some contexts – where care and expertise has gone into the design of the site’s interface – this has worked reasonably well. But even when it’s done properly, there are always cases where the available options provided to the user do not match the complexity of his or her requirements.Car insurance sites, for example, are generally fine if you’re trying to do a straightforward transaction: get a quote; renew a policy; make a claim; register a change of address. But if you have an inquiry that doesn’t fall into these categories then in the end you will have to make a phone call. And then you wind up listening to appalling muzak while being assured that your call is important.Sadly, the New Britain Project has no proposals for how the private sector could reduce the levels of quiet desperation to which its practices reduce people. But it does have suggestions about what the public sector could do. These include: creating an open-source, centrally supported website platform (gov.local) for local authorities, along the lines of gov.uk; reforming and coordinating local authority procurement of IT services so that there is real competition for the work; mandating common data standards across public services; and making the NHS app and nhs.uk the default digital front door for GP services.All sensible ideas. But don’t try phoning the New Britain Project about them. Their website doesn’t give their number.What I’ve been readingHere comes the authoritarian coupReally sobering assessmentby Noah Smithof what’s happening in the US.Next stop: revolutionSci-fi writer Charlie Stross wondersin a blogpostwhether the US is moving into a “pre-revolutionary” crisis.Crisis, which crisis?When the polycrisis hits the omnishambles, what comes next?

She is also the co-founder of theWorld Weather Attributioninitiative, which seeks to determine the influence of global warming on intensity and likelihood of an extreme weather event. The project also examines how factors such as ill-suited architecture and poverty exacerbate heatwaves, hurricanes, floods and wildfires. This is the theme of her second book,Climate Injustice: Why We Need to Fight Global Inequality to Combat Climate Change.The thesis of your book is that the climatecrisis isa symptom ofglobalinequality and injustice. That will be quite topsy-turvy to some people, who think globalheating is caused by the amount of carbon that we are putting into the atmosphere.Yes, of course, if you just stick to the physics, then the warming is caused by the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, but the amount of carbon in the atmosphere is caused by the burning of fossil fuels. And it is also the case that those who benefit from the burning of fossil fuels are the few already wealthy people who have stakes in or own the companies themselves. The vast majority of people do not benefit. The American dream is social mobility, not burning fossil fuels.You are arguing that racism, colonialism and sexism all underpin globalheating. Tackling those thingsseems more challenging than a technical solution for the climatecrisis.Of course it’s more challenging than just inventing some stuff. But we have solar and other renewable sources of energy and this isn’t solving the problem. The problem will only be solved if we address the underlying causes. I argue those are the inequalities in our society.Some would say those kind of statements are political, and scientists should stick to the science.The idea of writing this book came through my work because every time we do a study, we look at what the role of climate change is in the weather event that ultimately led to disasters. But we also look at what else is happening, who was affected, why were they affected. I would say in all cases, what turns weather into a disaster is not how much it rained but how vulnerable people are and how well prepared. Therefore, depending on which type of weather event we are looking at and where in the world we are, we always find that the more unequal the society is, be that a US city or a state in western Africa, the more severe the consequences.View image in fullscreenA man carrying a jug of water during the 2021 heatwave in Portland, Oregon.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesThe relationship betweenthe extraction of fossil fuels and colonialism and racism seems clear, but can you explain how sexism intersects with globalheating?In all the studies we have done, we have found that the more patriarchal the structures in a society, the worse the consequences of climate change are. If women are excluded from decision-making and don’t have access to finance, many more people die and lose their livelihoods in extreme weather.Why do you find the term natural disaster misleading?There are natural hazards, although because of climate change, they’re also becoming quite unnatural in some instances. But whether it turns into a disaster has very little to do with nature and a lot to do with social vulnerability.Is the Cop [UN climate summit] process fit for purpose? It seems to be more about maintaining the status quo.It is definitely not fit for purpose because it’s not achieving what we need: faster change and change that would really benefit the majority of the people and not just the very few. But it’s not the fault of the Cop process. It has actually achieved quite a lot because if we hadn’t had this conversation, we would be on track to a four- or five-degree [warmer] world. We are now on track to a three-degree world, which is still a world we absolutely do not want to live in. But it is thanks to the Cop process that we talk about climate change on an international global level. TheParis agreementstates that we care about climate change because it violates human rights and we want to do something about it. That is a major achievement. What we have to do now is not to say: “Oh it’s all shit, let’s abandon it all.” But how can we make these institutions stronger because they can serve us well and we need them.Do individuals bear responsibility too? Politicians, businesspeople, even scientists?The process – as in the institutions, Cop, international justice etc – is great, but it can only work if all individuals support it. At the moment we see that many try to dismantle them, all of us have a duty to fight for them, policymakers, scientists etc. Without these institutions there will be no prosperity.You write aboutthePacific north-westheatwave of 2021, which caused more than1,000deaths and had enormous economic impact. Does it concern you that tragic events like this don’t appear to bewake-up calls?We do need wake-up calls, but we need more than that. Without having an idea of what to do, they won’t suffice. But we have learned some things from these events. For example, the biggest difference in every extreme event for the death toll is whether there are functioning early warning systems or not. We saw this withHurricane Helene: in Florida people are used to hurricanes and are aware that if there is a forecast that says evacuate, you have to evacuate. But a bit further north in the Appalachians, [where] people are less used to it, they didn’t. Plus there was a lot of disinformation and the FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency] was attacked for trying to help people. So the death toll was much higher.View image in fullscreenDamage in Florida caused by Hurricane Helene.Photograph: Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty ImagesOne Republican congresswomansuggested that the US governmentcreated the hurricane.The fact that you can say that and probably half the people who would listen to you would think: “Yeah, why not?” That’s a big issue. I don’t know how to solve the “facts don’t matter any more” problem.Calling those people climate-crisis deniers seems inadequate.The more incredible the lie, the better it sticks. We have so many lines of evidence and so much data and it all shows the same thing. By questioning the data, you can’t create arguments that climate change isn’t happening. So I guess the fact-free approach is actually the result of the success of science.You described the Pacific north-west heatwave as being “mathematically impossible”; that it was so rare that it could only happen once in 100,000years.Yes, if you don’t take climate science into account. Once you take global warming into account, it goes from being outside everything you would expect from a normal statistical assessment to 1 in 100 or 200.And those odds are shortening?Yes, very much so. So in a two-degree world you would expect to see this once every five years or so.Earlier this month a board member of global insurerAllianz SEnoted that we are on track for a rise of 2.2C and 3.4C above preindustrial levels. He said a rise of 3C would render many regions uninsurable and make investment too uncertain –ultimately capitalism would cease to be viable. Does that ring true to you?It’s interesting to hear it in such terms from an insurer. Capitalism as we know it now would be unviable. We are on track to tear it down by accident.Climate Injusticeby Friederike Otto is published by Greystone (£22). To support theGuardianandObserverorder your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Contaminating that process with bits of plastic quite likely has implications for fertility, hormonal balance and overall reproductive health, the authors wrote.The findings represent a major step toward figuring out how and why microplastics impact women’s reproductive health, but are also “very alarming”, Luigi Montano, a researcher at the University of Rome and study lead author, said.‘A scary time to be a scientist’: how medical research cuts will hurt the maternal mortality crisisRead more“This discovery should serve as an important warning signal about the invasiveness of these emerging contaminants in the female reproductive system,” the study states.From the top of Mt Everest to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, microplastics and smaller nanoplastics have been detected throughout the environment. Food is thought to be a main exposure route: recent studies found them inall meatandproduce productstested.Microplastics are particularly dangerous because they can contain any number of 16,000 plastic chemicals. That includes highly toxic compounds likePfas, bisphenol and phthalates, which are linked to cancer, neurotoxicity, hormone disruption and developmental toxicity.Microplastics have been found throughout the human body and can cross thebrainandplacentalbarriers.Montano’s latest paper is part of alarger projecthe’s leading for which he has also detected microplastics in humanurineandsemen, and examines the impacts on fertility. He said he suspects microplastics are among chemicals driving plummeting sperm counts and a drop in overall sperm quality.“We have proven this decline, especially in areas where pollution is bad,” Montano said.Though men are more susceptible to the substance’s toxic effects, he added, women are also possibly impacted. Animal research has linked the presence of microplastics to ovarian dysfunction and health problems, like reduced oocyte maturation, and a lower capacity for fertilization. Another study on mice showed alterations to ovarian tissue.The paper notes a “possible presence of correlation between the concentration of microplastics” and reproductive health in the women who participated in the new study.Montano added that the bisphenol, phthalates, Pfas and other highly toxic chemicals that use microplastics as a “Trojan horse” to get into the body, and into the ovaries, are “very dangerous”. The chemicals are already well-known for disrupting hormones and harming women’s reproductive health.The follicular fluid paper offers a “very important finding”, said Xiaozhong Yu, a University of New Mexico microplastics researcher, but he added that more work is needed to determine the dose and level of exposure at which adverse effects start to happen.“This is the work in the next phase – we need to quantify,” Yu said. His team is also attempting to answer some of those questions with broader epidemiological research.Montano’s team is doing similar work, and he’s spearheading research that is trying to determine how much reducing the use of plastic in the kitchen and eating an organic diet will reduce the level of microplastics in the body.The substances’ ubiquity makes it difficult to avoid, but reducing the amount of plastic used in the kitchen – from packaging to storage to utensils – can likely reduce exposures. Pesticides can contain microplastics, or in some cases are a form of microplastics, so eating organic may help.Experts also advise that people avoid heating plastic, or putting hot food and liquid in plastic.Single-use paper coffee cups, for example,can shedtrillions of bits of plastic when hot liquid is added. Similarly, tea bagscan releasebillions of particles, and microwavable plastic isalso a problem. Plastic utensils that briefly come into contact with hot pans can also leach chemicals; wood and stainless steel alternatives are less harmful.Explore more on these topicsWomen's healthPFASPlasticsWomenHealthPregnancyHealth & wellbeingnewsShareReuse this content"

Everyone uses West Green Road, regardless of whether you have a lot of money or not, regardless of your background.”After getting in touch with Trees for Streets, a sponsorship scheme that guides communities across England on how to plant trees in their local areas with support from local councils, a small group was formed to work out how to do it. As a first step, Straw and friends were provided with an interactive map to choose the location of the trees, and that was passed along to Haringey council.Then they got help to set up a crowdfunding campaign, which was shared in local WhatsApp groups and community forums, secured 168 backers and raised more than £6,000 in one month.Mohamed al-Jawhari, a co-chair of Haringey Living Streets, said: “It [WhatsApp] is a very powerful tool for getting a very simple message out very quickly to a lot of people. I got in contact with, like, a thousand people in a few minutes, because I forwarded on the message with a bit of an explanation to a local group here, a local group there, people who were interested in the environment and maybe wanted to help West Green.”The remaining costs were covered by Haringey council. The result? Twenty beautiful trees planted across the neighbourhood.The plan is as local as it gets, but it is also global. Around the world, city residents are working out how to fill their streets with trees as evidence grows of their benefits. As temperatures rise, research has shown that urban trees can play a fundamental role in keeping cities cool, evaporating water to provide a natural form of air-conditioning, cooling air temperatures andreducing the urban heat island effect. Work by Friends of the Earth in five English cities in 2023 showed that areas with more trees and greenery wereup to 5C cooler.View image in fullscreenProperties in Kensington, Philadelphia. The Pennsylvania Horticultural Society in Philadelphia trains people to lead community groups to plant trees.Photograph: Tony Wood/AlamyCities and countriies are applying all kinds of models. Some councils and governments plant the trees using public money. In 2021, for example, the Canadian government launched the 2 Billion Trees programme, providing financial support to provinces, organisations and Indigenous governments to plant trees over a period of 10 years.But public funds are stretched everywhere, and the community model followed by Trees for Streets empowers local people to take their own action without waiting for a government plan.The Pennsylvania Horticultural Society (PHS) is a non-profit organisation in Philadelphia that trains individuals to lead community groups to plant treesacross the US city. So far their programme, Tree Tenders, has trained more than 6,500 people, who have led volunteers in planting more than 3,000 trees each year.Andrew Conboy, an urban forester in Philadelphia whose work involves managing, maintaining and replanting street and park trees in the city, said: “Most of the tree planting in Philadelphia is done through PHS. They do really great work all around the city and also in the suburbs surrounding the city. So many groups surrounding the cities are Tree Tenders groups.”He added: “There’s a heavy emphasis on native species here in the Philadelphia area, which is good thing because the native species are ultimately better for our wildlife and for our ecosystems, because those are the species that evolved here, and our wildlife need those species.”The Garden City Fund, a charity in Singapore, runs a similar initiative, the Plant-a-Tree programme. Individuals and organisations can donate to the cost of a young tree and then plant it in one of their managed green spaces.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The organisation also runs the School Greening programme, which provides training to parents, students, teachers and district leaders to plant and maintain trees in schools. Since the organisation was founded in 1973, it has worked with 3 million volunteers to plant more than 3m trees, included 30,000 trees on school campuses.As the West Green residents take turns discussing their local initiative over cups of coffee, it’s clear that one of the most significant impacts the project has had is in strengthening connections within the community.Nick Owen, the owner of the local cafe Perkyn’s on West Green Road, who contributed to the crowdfunder, said: “It’s lovely having the trees here now but it also feels a bit like a legacy. In five or 10 years when these trees are getting bigger and fuller, it’ll be beautiful to see our kids growing up with that as well and knowing that we contributed to it.”Dan Snell, an urban forest officer at Haringey council who surveyed the location for the trees in West Green and works with communities on tree-planting initiatives across the borough, said: “We have people who are enthusiastic about the long-term health of the trees and we want it to be something they can take ownership of, I suppose, like an extension of their home, something that’s in the public realm but is also looked after by the community.“There was another tree scheme on my mum’s street who lives in Haringey … suddenly there were all these new street trees and my mum had met a load of neighbours that she hadn’t really met before, even though she’s been there for 30 years. It’s had this really lovely long-term effect on bringing the street together. It’s such a wonderful thing to connect over.”Explore more on these topicsThe alternativesTrees and forestsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

More than a dozen schools are evicting ­existing preschool providers that operate in classrooms amid concerns they are doing so to access state funding to set up their own provision.It means that the pledge to create thousands of nursery places may be fulfilled by cannibalising some of the existing preschools, according to theEarly Years Alliance(EYA).The umbrella group said in some cases schools were offering less childcare and for fewer children than the private, voluntary and independent (PVI) nurseries that had previously worked on their premises, so parents would be forced to find childminders to ­maintain their existing levels of care.On 2 April the government approved funding for thefirst 300 school-based nurseriesto meet its pledge to create more than100,000 new places in Englandfor children from nine months old.Many private nurseries already operate on school premises, and only 9%, or 27, of the 300 schools with funding have confirmed they are working with their nursery tenants.So far, 15 preschools have ­contacted EYA to say they had been told they would need to leave at the end of the summer term.Neil Leitch, EYA chief executive, said ministers had intended the ­nursery funding to address “childcare deserts”, where parents were forced to stay at home rather than work because there was no help available.View image in fullscreenSt Michael’s Playgroup, Finedon.“They said they were really keen to work alongside existing ­providers because, if you’re not careful, you risk creating a childcare desert ­somewhere else,” he said.“The policy seems to have significantly drifted from what we were led to believe – that there would be additional support where it was needed and it would not damage the PVI ­sector. To sideline the existing provision is folly. It is short-term folly.”Leitch said PVI nurseries that work with the most vulnerable families tended to be in less affluent areas and disrupting funding made it more likely they would be forced to shut.He added he was disappointed thatDepartment for Education(DfE) guidance suggested schools should make it easier to evict PVIs or childminders by giving them licences rather than leases, which gave ­security of tenure.“Many are ­starting to feel this government is anti- ­existing providers. It may be an ­unintended ­consequence, but when you write statements encouraging schools to not give decent leases to the PVI sector, it’s difficult to interpret it in any other way.”Alison Wilkinson leads a ­volunteer playgroup with 24 three- to four-year-olds in Doncaster that has been active for 32 years.But the primary school it ­operates from has told it to leave by July, she said, and although it has finally found an alternative building, the venue needs ­refurbishment, threatening the future of the preschool and its charity, which offers support and equipment such as ­buggies for new parents. “If we don’t get any support, we’re going to close come September and there’s jobs that are going to be lost and the community isn’t going to have a charity that supports them,” she said.“It’s really stressful,” she added. “We’re struggling to get tradesmen quotes. Being a nonprofit, we can’t get grants until you’ve got quotes, then you’ve got to wait for the grant. And we’ve got to re-register with Ofsted.“We’ve never had to advertise. Parents come back to us year on year. They’re very upset because they love my staff. Basically we’ve got to build this whole new community again.”Wilkinson’s preschool offered all-day support but she believes the school only plans to offer morning sessions, so parents would need to find childminders to fill in.View image in fullscreenRebecca Stanford-Durdan, who runs the St Michael’s playgroup in Finedon, Northamptonshire, was forced to find new premises after her contract was cancelled.Rebecca Stanford-Durdan, who runs the St Michael’s playgroup in Finedon, Northamptonshire, said she had always had a good relationship with her school but was stunned when it called her to a meeting in March to tell her it was terminating the contract to create its own nursery.“I was quite upset – I didn’t see it coming. I knew what the government were doing but I didn’t think it would happen to us.” Stanford-Durdan added the ­playgroup was lucky to find a local community centre to move to. “I’ve come across other settings who have had to close,” she said.Richard Freedman, chair of governors of Finedon infant school, said the school had been “actively considering adding its own nursery but timing had not been right“ and that the decision to do so was “not ­connected to the government’s drive to create new places”. He expected there to be more overall provision in the town.Sian, who runs a preschool in Surrey, was told in October that her lease was being cancelled.“I thought they were going to extend our lease and then they said: ‘No, we’re getting rid because the ­government want all nurseries in school and we could get £150,000 for it,’” she said. The preschool has found another premises in a village nearby but she is having to pay rent on the new site and the school building while refurbishments are happening.A DfE spokesperson said: “Expanding access to high-­quality early years education where it’s needed most, so every child gets the best start, is vital to delivering our plan for change. We continue to value the vital role of private and voluntary providers, who remain central to our childcare reforms, including through targeted funding like the £100m childcare expansion capital grant.“From September, we will be extending funded hours to 30 hours a week, saving parents up to £7,500 a year as we also create thousands of places in new school-based nurseries. This expansion will help us get a record proportion of children school-ready, hitting key developmental targets.”Explore more on these topicsEarly years educationThe ObserverPrimary schoolsSchoolsDepartment for EducationLabourChildrenChildcarenewsShareReuse this content"

She has contributed thoughts on everything from the psychological impact of the Covid pandemic to the importance of vitamin D and how playing darts can improve your health.However, her pronouncements have begun to disappear from articles after concerns that Santini may not be all that she appears. Major news outlets have removed entire articles featuring Santini, or comments made by her, after a series of questions were raised over her qualifications – and even whether her entire identity could be an elaborate hoax.The case has been described as a wake-up call for newsrooms, as AI tools make it far easier for bad actors to invent supposed experts for their own purposes. Santini’s output has been prolific, with comments in Vogue, Metro, Cosmopolitan, the i newspaper, the Express, Hello!, the Telegraph, the Daily Star, the Daily Mail and the Sun in recent years. She was also quoted in an article for the BBC’s international site, BBC.com.On closer inspection, her main online presence is as a sex and relationships adviser at an online sex toy outlet, Peaches and Screams. Some of the articles featuring her include a link to the store. Her qualifications are described there as “psychologist and sex adviser – University of Oxford”. However, the British Psychological Society (BPS) said she was not one of its members. She does not appear to have social media profiles, though she has two followers on the blogging site Medium.Questions over Santini were first raised by the Press Gazette. Peaches and Screams did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The Guardian made several attempts to reach her through a number understood to be connected to her, asking for a meeting or conference call to confirm her identity as well as verification of her qualifications. A message was eventually received stating: “Thank you for your interest in this matter.” No further verification was provided.Some of the reporters who have quoted her said they received comments through companies that connect journalists with experts. Some cited one such service, ResponseSource. The company has now launched an investigation and suspended the PR agency that handled Santini, and is planning a peer review system that allows journalists to rate an expert they have featured.Santini also briefly featured on Qwoted, another platform connecting experts to journalists. Shelby Bridges, its director of user success, said the profile was removed after it found “immediate red flags pertaining to credentials and where the account was being accessed from”. She added: “Due to our inability to fully validate her credentials, we disabled the account shortly after it was created.”Reach, which owns the Daily Mirror, Daily Express and Daily Star, is among the news outlets removing Santini from its coverage. This includes a Daily Star article in which Santini talked about how darts improved qualities such as “planning, foresight and problem-solving”.Also removed was a Daily Mirror story in which Santini said the Covid pandemic had left some people with “difficulties establishing new relationships, heightened irritability, or a tendency to avoid social situations entirely”. The Guardian has removed her comments from an advertising feature on its website.The BBC has removed her comments from a piece about AI by BBC Future, commissioned by BBC.com. A BBC spokesperson said: “As a widely used commentator, Barbara Santini’s quotes were used in good faith by BBC Future. While the substance of the article remains valid and her contribution was minor, given we have been unable to confirm Santini’s credentials, we have removed her quotes from the piece.”The Independent has removed several stories that featured Santini commenting on subjects such as the differences between abuse and BDSM, as well as the importance of vitamin D. Yahoo has removed Santini’s quotes from articles, adding the clarification: “An earlier version of this story included information from a source whose expertise may not be valid. The quotes from the source have been removed.”While the details of Santini’s case remain unclear, it has raised the issue of how journalists verify the credentials of sources in the AI age. Charlie Beckett, the leader of the journalism and AI project at the London School of Economics, said: “This is about long-running pressures on journalists to be quicker. This is not the AI itself that’s at fault here. This is unscrupulous people, it seems. It is a wake-up call to all of us, frankly.”Roman Raczka, the president of the BPS, said: “Working with a professional membership body such as the British Psychological Society provides peace of mind to all reporters that they are speaking to a real person.”Explore more on these topicsNational newspapersNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingSocial mediaDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

We know what this means. It means restructures, it means redundancies, memberslosing their jobsand children losing their teachers.”Patrick Roach, the NASUWT’s general secretary, said: “We know that the government has been handed the pay review body’s latest report and we hope that the pay review body has been ambitious in putting forward recommendations that will address the ongoingrecruitment and retention crisis.”If the spending review fails to top up school budgets, the two unions are likely to hold formal strike ballots among their members in the summer, setting the scene for potential school closures in the autumn.In a video address to the NASUWT conference on Saturday, Phillipson told delegates: “The toughest financial inheritance in a generation has meant that we’ve already had to take some incredibly difficult decisions, and I’m afraid that more are still coming.”The NASUWT scrapped a planned announcement about Roach’s replacement as general secretary, after he announced in October that he would be stepping down.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The small South Yorkshire city is a key battleground that will be a test of Labour’s resilience in the face of rising public support forReform UK.Nigel Farage’s party is surging ahead in the polls and in Doncaster there is a good chance it will wrestle control fromLabour, which has been in power for nearly 50 years. Last month, a poll conducted by Electoral Calculus for the Telegraph found Reform was expected to win 32 of the council’s 55 seats.“It’s a beautiful town, with so much potential,” said Vallance, who has some sympathies with Reform and previously explored standing for the party. “I was all about Brexit,” he said, “and we need to deal with the immigration problem in Doncaster.”Immigration was on the minds of lots of people in the city centre on Wednesday, with some saying they felt it had had a negative impact on the city, particularly when it came to asylum seekers, of whom there are 688 housed in Doncaster, according to Home Office figures.“I know they’ve got to be put somewhere but Doncaster has changed and it’s not for the better,” one man said.This sentiment is exactly what Reform is hoping to harness, and why Farage paid a visit to the city at the start of April in support of Alexander Jones, the party’s mayoral candidate.While there was also disgust among some Doncaster residents at the idea of voting for Reform, Labour was not popular either. Most people, in one way or another, pointed to what they felt was decline in the city, blaming the cash-strapped council.It is something the current mayor, Labour’s Ros Jones, who has been in the directly elected post since 2013, is all too aware of, having battled under the weight of enormous budget cuts from central government.She said: “I have made incredibly difficult decisions in terms of council services over the years of austerity, protecting frontline services and keeping council tax low, with Doncaster having the lowest council tax inYorkshire.”Though Jones had some supporters on the streets of Doncaster – one couple said they were “not unhappy” with the council and called Farage a liar and a “mini-Trump” – she is also contending with the council’s reputation.Near the start of her tenure, she pulled the local authority out of special measures after the tabloids called Doncaster the“worst council in Britain”, and the label seems to have stuck.View image in fullscreenDoncaster high street.Photograph: Alexandra Wallace/The GuardianLabour could face a bigger brand-recognition problem in Doncaster as some of those out and about only vaguely recognised Keir Starmer’s name. This might be cheering news for Reform except Farage’s name did not necessarily ring bells either.“Never heard of him,” said Shelly, who was out in the Frenchgate shopping centre with her friends Siobhan and Jade.“Was he in the Celebrity jungle?” Jade asked. “He seemed all right but I wouldn’t know about his politics.”Though they did not know Reform, the trio did broadly agree with the party’s policies on immigration. “We need to get back to British, not everybody else,” Siobhan said. “We shouldn’t be fetching migrants when we can’t even look after our own.”Shelly said: “I daren’t say owt because it sounds racist.”They felt people coming to the UK were getting better treatment than those born here, particularly because they were put up in hotels and given homes without having to work.The UK has a legal duty to house asylum seekers, and paid work is forbidden under asylum rules. The women said they were not against this, they just wanted to see British people better looked after.“It’s a bleak future for the next generation,” Siobhan said.The issue for all parties is likely to be getting voters to the polls. Most people the Guardian spoke to in Doncaster on Wednesday lunchtime said they did not vote and had not known there was a local election happening at all.“I don’t do politics,” one man said. “Whoever’s the prime minister, good luck to them.”View image in fullscreenNaomi Nache and Michael Yip.Photograph: Alexandra Wallace/The GuardianNaomi Nache, from Romania, and Michael Yip, from Scunthorpe, moved to Doncaster when they started working in an Amazon warehouse. They have plans to leave for a bigger city, citing a lack of things to do in Doncaster, particularly on the “artistic side”.Safety was a big issue for Nache, who said she felt afraid to go out in the city on her own. “It can be a bit scary. It doesn’t feel safe. I wouldn’t come to the town centre by myself,” she said.Vallance has campaigned on public safety and tackling antisocial behaviour, knowing something about the subject himself having received a criminal conviction in 2016 for dressing up as the “Donny Klown” in an effort to attract attention to societal problems.“I scared a lot of people and I’m really sorry about what I did. I went about it the wrong way,” Vallance said. “I took the mask off many years ago.

Premier League matches accounted for 20% (15.8 million) of all sports attendances.Ilie Oleart, from Barcelona, founded LMI, which has covered football matches in England for Spanish-speaking fans around the world since 2011. The channel has attracted nearly half a million subscribers, and in 2018 began offering trips to the UK so fans could experience the English game.Oleart, who supports the Catalan club Espanyol, who play in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football, said he aspired to not only arrange trips but to be involved in a club in a more meaningful way.“Our aim was to transform a small local English club into a small local club with a global fanbase,” he said.Harborough Town FC,nicknamed the Bees, emerged as the fans’ choice after Oleart consulted his subscriber base. LMI has brought its subscribers along to watch matches at the grounds of Brighton and Hove Albion, Sheffield United and Wycombe Wanderers.“I met people at the club in September to get to know their history, the town and the facilities,” said Oleart. “We thought they were the perfect club with the right values to share with our audience.”Football matches at Harborough Town, which take place in the Southern League Premier Division Central , will now feature live on the LMIYouTubechannel, allowing Spanish speakers an opportunity to become “virtual supporters” of the club.The Bees chair, Peter Dougan, said the partnership with LMI was an “opportunity to grow our fanbase and our income” through a global audience and could open the door to sponsorship deals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was the first conversation between the British prime minister and the US president since the imposition of 10% tariffs by Washington.Reeves told theDaily Telegraph: “Well, China is the second biggest economy in the world, and it would be, I think, very foolish to not engage. That’s the approach of this government.”Reeves to make case for trade deal in first meeting with US treasury secretaryRead moreShe also said she supported the fast-fashion company Shein floating on the London Stock Exchange. Shein was founded inChina, but is now based in Singapore.The company has faced allegations of supply chain and labour abuses.Reeves’s comments came a week after the government was granted emergency powers by parliament to continue operations at the British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, owned by the Chinese company Jingye.Jingye was accused of not ordering enough supplies to keep the blast furnaces at the site in north Lincolnshire running, leading to a race against time to stop the furnaces cooling.MPs had criticised potential links between Jingye and the Chinese government, leading to questions over whether Chinese companies would be allowed to invest in critical infrastructure in the UK.The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said the companies would be looked at in “a different way” to those from other countries in regard to the steel industry, but refused to rule out Chinese investment in other sectors.The Chinese embassy in London criticised some MPs for “anti-China” rhetoric, and an “arrogance, ignorance and twisted mindset” towards the country.Reeves told the Telegraph that Chinese investment would be blocked from sensitive areas of critical national infrastructure.UK trade secretary to visit China with aim of reviving key joint trade commissionRead moreShe said she was open to Shein being listed on the London Stock Exchange, as it and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) had “very strict standards”.Shein filed with the FCA in June last year for an initial public offering that could be worth £50bn. However, the FCA hastaken longer than usual to approve it, amid concerns over its supply chain.The campaign group Stop Uyghur Genocide sent a dossier to the FCA in August alleging that Shein used cotton from China’s Xinjiang region.Reeves said: “We have lost business and we have lost companies in recent years and we’re working closely with the London Stock Exchange to make the UK a more vibrant place to list.”Reeves will hold talks with US officials, including the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, during her visit next week to attend the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings with other finance ministers.It is hoped that tariff reductions could be agreedwithin weeks or months.Starmer told Trump of his “commitment to free and open trade and the importance of protecting the national interest” in their 35-minute call on Friday.British officials have presented a draft deal to their US counterparts that includes reductions to tariffs on steel, aluminium and cars.Sources say it does not cover pharmaceuticals, however. Trump has said he will announce tariffs for the sector “very shortly”, in a move that could cost British drug companies billions of pounds in revenue.Explore more on these topicsTrade policyRachel ReevesChinaForeign policyLabourGlobal economyInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

Bags of carrots, broccoli and other vegetables and fruit including courgettes are also included in the promotions.The president of the National Farmers’ Union, Tom Bradshaw, said: “While promotional activity can help driving sales, it’s important that retailers take responsibility for their decisions to massively discount products and ensure it doesn’t have long term impacts on the public’s perception of true market value and production costs.“As an industry we need to drive investment to deliver for future food security and the British people who truly value high quality, homegrown food. A crucial part of that is a fair and transparent market, where farmers and growers can get fair returns for the risk and capital invested.”Scott Walker, the head of trade body GB Potato, said: “There is a concern that these prices does not in any way reflect the cost of production and if that puts the sense in consumers’ mind how much it costs to produce these foods that’s a concern for the future.”Supermarkets say they bear the cost of the discounts and the prices do not affect the amount paid to suppliers and farmers, adding that discounting can entice more shoppers to try fresh vegetables.Andrew Opie, the director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, a trade body that represents all the big supermarkets, said:“Vegetables are a vital part of a balanced diet, and by providing discounts where they can, retailers are supporting healthy eating for all households. Retailers understand the importance of a strong supply chain and the need to offer farmers a fair price, while still offering great value for customers.”However, Dale Robinson, the head of procurement at Riverford Organic Farmers, which charges £18 each for its fruit and veg boxes including delivery, said heavy discounting undermined the true cost of food production as planting, growing, harvesting and transporting fresh produce could not be done sustainably at such low prices.“While these deals might seem like a win for shoppers, they create unrealistic expectations about food costs and leave farmers struggling to cover even their most basic expenses.,” he said.The worries emerged as the vegetable industry wrestles with heavier costs includinghigher wages and employer national insurance contributions, as well new barriers to the import of vital supplies, such as young plants and seeds, as a result of Brexit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Eventually he started getting noticed for the things he wanted to say.”They added: “That style of media strategy seems to make a lot more sense than making the occasional appearance on the [BBC] Today programme or Laura Kuenssberg.”AnotherLabourMP added: “I watched the first few days of the Trump administration with envy. He was out there making announcements all the time.“Imagine if we had done the same thing. It doesn’t even matter whether your announcements are going to happen – the point is you are telling people who you are and what you want to do.”Even in his first term as US president, Trump took an unusual approach to communications, often making policy announcements or evenfiring peopleon social media. He would also call in to his favourite Fox news shows to give impromptu and freewheeling interviews.Trump and Vance took a similar approach in their recent election campaign, often taking part in lengthy podcast interviews with hosts such as Joe Rogan, Logan Paul and Theo Von.Those interviews would often throw up awkward moments,such aswhen Vance laughed along with Von’s reference to the Sackler family, who are Jewish, as “money lizards”. But they were generally regarded as having reached parts of the electorate – often young and male – that other politicians struggle to engage.Since taking over, Trump has extended this strategy even further, going as far as tobroadcast large portionsof his first cabinet meeting, at which the billionaire Elon Musk defended his plans to slash the size of the American government.After hisrecent televised rowwith the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the president remarked to the press: “This is going to be great television.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone with shit.”Starmer’s Downing Street, however, prefers to keep a much firmer grip on message discipline, issuing reams of “lines to take” for ministers to follow in interviews and cancelling interviews at the last minute if they have not been entered into the No 10 “grid” of planned media appearances.“Politicians need today to be able to communicate in 30 seconds on TikTok, but also for three and a half hours on Joe Rogan,” said Lee Cain, Boris Johnson’s former communications chief and founding partner of the public relations firm Charlesbye.“The ‘line to take’ is dying, the ‘grid’ is dying,” he added. “That whole process where we send politicians on to news programmes with a goal of not saying anything, not creating news, not making a mistake, killing authenticity – is a failing strategy.”A recent analysis by Charlesbye found Rogan’s podcast now attracts almost as many daily listeners in the UK as BBC Radio 4’s entire output. Facebook has overtaken the BBC as the most widely consumed source of news, while for the under-35s, TikTok dominates.Some in Labour, however, while acknowledging that the media landscape has changed, believe it would not work for Starmer to try to take advantage of it in the way Trump has.One Labour MP said: “Trump can do that because that is his authentic persona. If Starmer suddenly tried to follow suit, it would not look authentic – and what matters most in this media landscape is authenticity.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Harsono, 33, was arrested four days after his visa was revoked without notice. He is scheduled for another hearing on 1 May.“His wife has been in a state of shock and exhaustion,” Sarah Gad, Harsono’s lawyer, said. “The Department of Homeland Security has weaponized the immigration system to serve just an entirely different purpose, which is to instill fear.”Harsono, a supply-chain manager at a hospital in Marshall,Minnesota, who is married to a US citizen, was surprised by authorities in his workplace basement on 27 March. Gad said that Harsono was detained without clear explanation and interrogated for hours.Harsono’s wife, Peyton, called Gad in a panic after she received a call from human resources at the hospital. Two Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents, dressed in plain clothes, had shown up and instructed the staff to stage a fake meeting in the basement so they could apprehend him, according to Gad.Hospital staff were distraught but felt forced to comply.“He unsuspectedly walks in, smiling, and then they just pull out their handcuffs and forcibly detain him, pushing against the wall, start frisking him, and stripping all of his belongings,” Gad said.View image in fullscreenAditya Wahyu Harsono (left) and Peyton Harsono, with their baby.Photograph: Peyton Harsono/GoFundMeThe Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the Guardian.Harsono was brought to the Kandiyohi County Jail, where he is still detained, according to theIce detainee locator.He told the Ice agents that his F-1 student visa was valid through June 2026, and that he had a pending green-card application based on his marriage to a citizen, but that he had been issued a notice to appear in court stating that he had overstayed his visa.His attorney said that as of 28 March, the day after his arrest, his F-1 visa was still active. Gad said the government revoked it without any notice to him, and then claimed he had overstayed.The revocation was backdated to 23 March and allegedly based on his 2022 misdemeanor conviction for graffitiing a semi-truck trailer. Gad said that this is not a deportable offense under the Immigration and Nationality Act. He had traveled internationally and returned multiple times to Indonesia since the conviction without incident.The day before Harsono’s bond hearing, DHS disclosed their evidence against him. Besides stating that his visa had been revoked for the misdemeanor graffiti conviction, for which he paid $100 in restitution, they also mentioned an arrest from 2021 during a protest over the murder of George Floyd. That charge was dismissed.Harsono is Muslim and frequently posts on social media in support of humanitarian relief for Gaza. He also runs a small non-profit, which sells art and merchandise, with proceeds going to organizations aiding Gaza.His wife and eight-month-old daughter, who has special needs, are distraught by his arrest, Gad said. After the judge granted Harsono a $5,000 bond on 10 April, the Minnesota Freedom Fund had been en route to pay it. But DHS immediately filed a notice to appeal the bond decision, which triggered an automatic stay, meaning Harsono had to remain in custody. Gad said this type of move is rare, usually only seen when a judge grants bond to someone charged with violent or serious crimes.“You never involve stays of an immigration judge’s bond order for a minor conviction when somebody’s on their way to becoming a green-card holder,” she said.Denied, detained, deported: the most high-profile cases in Trump’s immigration crackdownRead moreGad is preparing to file a federal petition and a temporary restraining order against DHS.Inan appeal for helpon GoFundMe, Harsono’s wife explained that her husband had been fired from his job while in detention and now the family is “in danger of losing our apartment” and they “no longer have health insurance”.The Minnesota Nurses Associationcondemnedthe hospital worker’s arrest and restated its position that “nurses should not and will not serve any role in immigration enforcement” and its hope that “all hospital employees will also reject a role in assisting Ice”.Harsono’s case comes amid a wave of reports ofstudent visas being revoked under the Trump administration’s new executive policy. The actions by the federal government to terminate students’ legal status have left hundreds of scholars at risk of detention and deportation.At least 901 students at 128 colleges and universities have had their visas revoked or their legal statuses terminated since mid-March, according to an Associated Press review of university statements and correspondence with school officials.In some high-profile cases, including the detention of the former Columbia University graduate studentMahmoud Khalil, the Trump administration has argued it should be allowed to deport noncitizens over involvement in pro-Palestinian activism it casts as antisemitic. But in the vast majority of visa revocations, colleges say there is no indication that affected students had a role in protests.Explore more on these topicsMinnesotaUS immigrationTrump administrationIndonesiaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Just over two weeks later, itresumed large-scale bombingand redeployed ground troops withdrawn during the truce.Since then, political figures and security officials have repeatedly vowed that aid deliveries will not resume until Hamas releases the remaining hostages seized during the7 October 2023 attacksthat ignited the conflict. Israel’s government has framed the new siege as a security measure and has repeatedly denied using starvation as a weapon, which would constitutea war crime.The blockade is now entering its eighth week, making it the longest continuous total siege the strip has faced to date in the 18-month war.Firmly supported by the US, its most important ally under Donald Trump, Israel appears confident that it can maintain the siege with little international pushback.‘Keeping people alive’: Gaza’s last working bakery forced by Israel to keep on movingRead moreIt is also moving ahead with large-scale seizures of Palestinian land for security buffer zones, and plans to shift control of aid delivery to the army and private contractors, exacerbating fears inGazathat Israel intends to maintain boots on the ground in the territory long-term and permanently displace its residents.Many people theObserverspoke tosaid they are now more afraid of famine than airstrikes. “Many times, I have had to give up my share of food for my son because of the severe shortages. It is the hunger that will kill me – a slow death,” said Hikmat al-Masri, a 44-year-old university lecturer from Beit Lahia in north Gaza.Food stockpiled during the two-month-ceasefire has run out, and desperate people across the territory are jostling at charity kitchens with empty pots and bowls. Goods at markets are now selling for 1,400% above ceasefire prices, according to the latest assessment from the World Health Organization.An estimated 420,000 people are on the move again because of new Israeli evacuation orders, making it difficult to compile hard data on hunger and malnutrition, but Oxfam estimates that most children are now surviving on less than one meal a day.About 95% of aid organisations have suspended or cut back services because of airstrikes and the blockade, and since February, Israel hastightened restrictionsfor international staff to enter Gaza. Basic medical supplies – even painkillers – are running out.“Gaza City is packed with displaced people who have fled Israeli troops moving into the north, and they are living on the street or putting their tents inside damaged buildings that are going to collapse,” said Amande Bazerolle, the Gaza emergency coordinator for Médecins Sans Frontières, speaking from Deir al-Balah.Bazerolle added: “There are not enough points of care for so many people. At our burns clinic in Gaza City, we are refusing patients by 10am and we have to tell them to come back the next day, as we are triaging to make our drug supplies last as long as possible.”The siege has been accompanied by a fierce push by Israeli forces on northern Gaza as well as the entirety of Rafah, the strip’s southernmost city, cutting the territory off from Egypt.According to the UN, approximately 70% of Gaza is now under Israeli evacuation orders or has been subsumed intoexpanding military buffer zones; the new Rafah security zone totals one-fifth of the entire territory.The land seizures are pushing the 2.3 million population – and aid and medical efforts – into ever-smaller Israeli-designated “humanitarian zones”, although anIsraeli airstrike last week on al-Mawasi, the biggest such zone on the coast of southern Gaza, killed 16 people.View image in fullscreenPeople survey the destruction in the aftermath of an Israeli military strike on al-Ahli hospital in the Gaza Strip in April 2025.Photograph: APAImages/REX/ShutterstockAs the space they can operate in shrinks, aid workers said they are worried that that the rules of engagement followed by the Israeli military have changed since the ceasefire collapsed, pointing to the recentbombings of Nasser hospitalin Khan Younis andal-Ahli hospitalin Gaza City.Two people were killed in the Nasser attack, which hit a building where members of an international medical team were present. No casualties were reported in the al-Ahli strike, but the intensive care and surgery departments of the hospital were destroyed, medics said. In both cases, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had targeted Hamas militants.“People in Gaza like having international staff around because they assume it affords them more protection and the IDF is less likely to attack the building or the area,” said a senior aid official, who asked not to be named so as to speak freely.“In the beginning of the war, if there was an airstrike two kilometres away from our location, we would evacuate… eventually, that became 300 metres, and now it’s 30 metres, if [the IDF] hits the building next door.“There are either no warnings, or sometimes 20 minutes, which is not enough time to evacuate sick people. Our exposure to risk is getting higher... We know the Israelis are trying to force us to work under their terms.”In a statement in response to the aid worker’s allegations, the IDF said: “Hamas has a documented practice of operating within densely populated areas. Strikes on military targets are subject to relevant provisions of international law, including taking feasible precautions.” It referred questions about aid to the political echelon.Israel has long alleged that Hamas siphons off large amounts of the aid that has reached Gaza, allowing the group to maintain its control by either keeping the aid for itself or selling it at marked-up prices to desperate civilians.View image in fullscreenIsraeli media reported last week that private contractors may be used to distribute humanitarian aid in Gaza.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/APLast week, Israeli media reported that efforts to sidestep international agencies and create an Israeli-controlled mechanism to distribute aidusing private contractorsare under way but still in the “early stages”, with no timeframe for implementation. In the interim, the humanitarian crisis will only worsen, aid agencies say.International mediators are attempting to revive ceasefire talks, but there is little sign either side has moved closer on fundamental issues such as the disarmament of Hamas and the withdrawal of Israeli troops.Masri, the lecturer from Beit Lahia, said: “When the blockade was imposed again and the war resumed, I felt terrified. I constantly think about my little son, and how I can provide him with basic necessities.“No one can imagine the level of suffering… Death surrounds us from every direction.”Explore more on these topicsGazaThe ObserverPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warHuman rightsAidnewsShareReuse this content"

Asked during a leaders’ debate on the ABC whether extreme weather events were worsening, the opposition leader said:“I don’t know because I’m not a scientist”.Dutton later said he“believes in climate change”and the Coalition was committed to Australia having net zero emissions by 2050.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterBut climate experts said its policies would boost local fossil fuel use, send the country backwards on emissions, put the net zero goal beyond reach and damage its reputation internationally.Bill Hare, a scientist and the Australia-based chief executive of Climate Analytics, said the Coalition’s positions were “almost totally regressive in the sense that they would unwind action in Australia”.He said if people accepted Dutton’s claim the Coalitionwanted to abolish a national legislated 2030 emissions target– a 43% cut below 2005 levels – but still supported getting to net zero emissions without introducing new policies “you are being taken for a mug”.The trend is in, but Australian voters’ views are soft and fragmented – how should we read the polls?Read more“It is too late to be listening to empty promises like that,” Hare said.The Grattan Institute’s energy and climate change program director, Tony Wood, said “every single one” of the Coalition’s policies in the area was “a reduction in ambition or slowing down emissions reductions”.“None of it is adding to emissions reductions,” he said. “It would be bordering on incredible to think that we could maintain a commitment to net zero by 2050 with no plans to head us in the direction for the next 10 to 15 years.”Guardian Australia asked the Coalition if it had any policies that would reduce emissions over the next decade. The shadow minister for climate change and energy, Ted O’Brien, replied it had a “track record of reducing emissions” and would continue to “advocate for solutions that deliver affordable, reliable and sustainable energy for all Australians”.He did not specify a Coalition policy that would cut emissions in the next 10 years.The Coalition’s policies include:Dropping a Labor goal of 82% of electricity coming from renewable generation by 2030 and slowing the rollout of solar and windfarms, in part by scrapping a “rewiring the nation” fund to build new transmission connections. Instead, it says the country would rely on more fossil fuels – coal and gas-fired power – until it could lift a ban on nuclear energy andbuild taxpayer-owned nuclear generators, mostly after 2040.Abolishing fines for car companies that do not meet targets to cut the average emissions from the new cars they sell.Not supporting Labor’s 2030 emissions reduction target. Former diplomats say lowering the target would put Australiain breach of commitments made in the 2015 Paris climate agreement.Opposinga joint Australia-Pacific bidto host a major UN climate summitin Adelaide next year.The Coalition has also said it would reviewthe safeguard mechanism– a policy introduced under Tony Abbott, and revamped under Labor to require major industrial polluters to either make direct cuts or buy carbon offsets – topossibly make it less onerous on business. Industry groups have largely supported Labor’s changes.Lesley Hughes, a professor emerita at Macquarie University and member of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists and the Climate Council, said the last Coalition government “went backwards” on addressing the climate crisis and “there’s nothing to suggest we won’t go backwards under the next Coalition government”.Hare has assessed the likely difference between Labor and the Coalition based on their current policies. He said government projections indicated Labor was headed for a 42.6% cut by 2030 – nearly on track to meet the 43% target – but the Coalition’s released policies would limit the cut to 36%.Zoe Daniel says team had nothing to do with Climate 200-backed robocall criticised by CoalitionRead moreHe pointed to modelling by Frontier Economics released in support of the Coalition’s nuclear plan that assumed Australia wouldget only 54% of its electricity from renewable energy, rather than 82%. “That would slow down emissions reduction dramatically … and would require more gas for the next 15 to 20 years,” Hare said.The Climate Change Authority has estimated it couldincrease national emissions by 2bn tonnes, adding the equivalent of more than four years of total Australian climate pollution.Hare and Wood both said the Coalition’s plan to scrap fines for car companies that did not meet the vehicle efficiency standard would make the policy pointless. “It’s like having a speed limit without a penalty,” Wood said.All experts who spoke with Guardian Australia bemoaned a lack of focus on climate change policy from the major parties given the challenge of reaching net zero and the rising impact of increased temperatures and extreme weather.Labor’s sole new climate policy released in the election has been a30% subsidy for households and small businesses that install batteries. Neither party has announced 2035 emissions targets or released a plan to reach net zero emissions, though Laborbegan work on a planin the last term and has promised a 2035 goal by September if re-elected.Wood said: “It is monumentally disappointing that these issues are not really being discussed by either party.”Hughes said the Great Barrier Reef hadjust suffered its sixth mass bleaching event in nine years, but the major parties seemed to be “quite strenuously avoiding talking about climate impacts.”Hare said the “lack of engagement on climate across the board has been quite depressing”.An initial assessment by the Climate Change Authority founda 2035 emissions reduction target of between 65% and 75%“would be ambitious and could be achievable if additional action is taken”. Organisations representingengineers, scientistsand thesocial service sectorhave called for a target of net zero emissions by 2035, in line with a goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Australian politicsCoalitionClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

The ceiling above her is full of holes, blackened by years of cooking fires. Manqele, 64, isn’t sure how many people live in the house’s seven rooms. There are no utilities, the landlord is absent and she hasn’t paid rent in years, she says through a translator. The occupants share a portable toilet provided and cleaned by an NGO, plus one outdoor tap with the house next door, which has no roof.Manqele’s home in the inner city district of Berea is emblematic of Johannesburg’s downtown, which was progressively abandoned by wealthy people, businesses and government from the 1980s.Hundreds of buildingsleft empty by landlords are now overcrowded, and the area is notorious for crime.Beyond the inner city, the shine is coming off the City of Gold, with growing numbers of residents dissatisfied with basic services such as water and roads, according to the latest quality of life survey by the Gauteng City-Region Observatory. In March South Africa’s presidentCyril Ramaphosacriticised the environment as being “not pleasing” and set up a presidential working group to“revive” Johannesburgbefore it hosts the G20 summit in November.View image in fullscreenStephen du Preez volunteers with the Jozi My Jozi coalition to spruce up the city.Photograph: Madelene Cronjé/the ObserverMeanwhile, artists and businesspeople are rallying to defend their city. “It’s always hustling – there’s an energy,” says Stephen du Preez, who manages 11 business improvement districts and volunteers with Jozi My Jozi, a business coalition launched in 2023 to spruce up downtown. “They’re friendly; they’re damn good people.”There are now about 140 businesses donating to Jozi My Jozi, with 75m rand (£3m) spent in two years on projects such as installing 613 solar-powered streetlights. The initiative, which Du Preez says works with local communities rather than gentrifying them, is also expanding to the former black-only township of Soweto.Previous efforts to regenerate inner-city districts, such as the trendy area of Maboneng, have excluded those living there, says Edward Molopi of the Socio-Economic Rights Institute ofSouth Africa(Seri), an NGO supporting Manqele and her neighbours. He says these efforts often involve evicting residents then raising rents: “Is there a place for the poor in the inner city? Many of these initiatives will answer in the negative.View image in fullscreenNoma Qwele at Manhattan Court in downtown Johannesburg.Photograph: Madelene Cronjé/the ObserverJohannesburg is a highly unequal city in theworld’s most unequal country. The new business district, Sandton, is known as “Africa’s richest square mile”. An estimated 1million trees were planted when the city was built on Highveld grassland in 1886, forming one of the world’slargest urban forests. But the townships, created by the apartheid regime in the mid-20th century to force non-white people to the city’s margins, are far less lush.At the city’s birth, when gold was discovered, black male migrant workers lived in mine camps in the south, white “Randlords” in northern hilltop mansions, and more mixed communities between. “There were these social fractures in the city at the very beginning,” says Noor Nieftagodien, a history professor at the University of the Witwatersrand.While Johannesburg’s problems have always hit the poorest the hardest, middle-class complaints are growing louder as issues such as water outages spread to the suburbs. Political instability – the city has had eight mayors in the past four years – and corruption are often blamed.Afrofuturism: reimagining science and the future from a black perspectiveRead moreThe inner city’s issues culminated in tragedy in 2023, when77 people were killedin a fire at80 Albert Road, an overcrowded apartment building owned by the city.  An inquiry blamed neglect by local authorities and the provincial premier pledged to act on its recommendations.The city government is implementing a “bad buildings strategy” to deal with “hijacked” buildings, spokesperson Virgil James says, noting there are court orders “to evacuate the occupiers to a temporary emergency accommodation” from six buildings.In Manhattan Court, a 108-room apartment building on a bustling shopping street, residents are collectively paying 25,000 rand a month to the city for services and to try to secure ownership of their homes, says Noma Qwele, a residents’ committee member who has lived there since 1986.They also pay for maintenance and security, but they still don’t know who the building’s owner is after it was sold in an auction, Qwele says, adding: “The building is for us.

The first bit of footage praising the taste of the expensive so-called “Dubai chocolate” was posted at the end of 2023 and has now been viewed more than 120m times, to say nothing of the many follow-up videos.The result has been an international shortage of the vital ingredient, pistachio ­kernels, which are largely grown in either the US or Iran. In a year, prices have surged from $7.65 to $10.30 a pound, Giles Hacking, from nut trader CG Hacking,told theFinancial Times.The nut was already becoming scarce due to last year’s poor harvest in the US, the world’s leading exporter. Although that crop was smaller than usual, it was of higher quality and so was largely sold as whole nuts, still in their shells. This has created a further shortage of the basic kernels used in the chocolate bars.Iranian producers, meanwhile, had exported 40% more nuts to the UAE in the six months to March than they had in the 12 months prior to that.Everyone has gone nuts for pistachios. But they’re just an upmarket green peanut, aren’t they? | Emma BrockesRead moreDubai chocolate mania can be sourced to the creation of a bar that combined milk chocolate, the shredded pastry known askataifi, and a pistachio cream filling. Made by the swish Emirati chocolatier Fix, which only sells in the UAE, it was prophetically given the punning name Can’t Get Knafeh of It, in reference to a traditional Arab dessert.Other leading chocolate makers, such as Läderach and Lindt, quickly created their own pistachio ­chocolate products, but are now struggling to meet international demand. Charles Jandreau, the general manager for Prestat Group, which owns several luxury British chocolate brands, told theFTthat the demand for the bars has surprised the industry. “It feels like it came out of nowhere,” he said. “Suddenly you see it in every corner shop.”Some stores are reportedly rationing the number of bars sold at one time. Testament, then, either to the power of TikTok influencers, or the rather more established appeal of tasty chocolate.Explore more on these topicsChocolateThe ObserverNuts and seedsTikTokFoodSocial mediaInternational tradeDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

Believe me, we’ve all got something to be mad about.”In stirring remarks, the 78-year-old former president, who was widely praised for how he helped the city grapple with its grief in the aftermath of the 19 April 1995 bombing in which 168 people died, including 19 children, offered a message of unity.‘The bomber’s words sound mainstream. Like he won!’ Oklahoma City’s tragedy in the time of TrumpRead moreClinton was just over two years into his first term as president when a truck bomb destroyed a nine-story US government building in the city’s downtown. He described how he was out jogging with the winners of the Boston marathon on the morning of the attack when he learned of the damage that had been done at the Alfred P Murrah federal building. “Thirty years ago, I thought I was going to have a different day,” he said.“Most of the people who lost their lives were public servants, as we all know,” Clinton said. “What they did every day was a matter of choice, showing up for work, to do business for the American people.”In his address, Clinton hinted at themes that were extremist in 1995 but have now become more established, noting that “in recent years the country has grown more polarized” and bringing the political forewarnings of theOklahomabombing into the present.“The terrorist who did this awful thing believed that it would spark a nationwide upheaval against the American government,” he said, “and would eventually destroy our government and democracy.“A lot of times a fanatic will tell you: ‘Sorry, this, that or the other thing had to happen but, you know, there had to be collateral damage sometimes to make a statement,’” he said. “But I’ve never heard anybody say that who had to live with the damage.”Clinton said Oklahoma City had offered the country an example of how to manage the response to tragedy. He referred to the “Oklahoma standard”, the resilient attitude described by news media and first responders to the tragedy, which was later embraced by the state and defined as “a statewide initiative preserving and promoting a culture of caring citizens by encouraging acts of service, honor and kindness”.The “bombing profoundly shook the country, and did more to all of you. But in the end it brought out the best in America,” Clinton told remembrance service attendees, and urged them to spread the same message to other Americans in the current turbulent political moment.“We can still find a way to move forward together with the Oklahoma standard,” he said. “We were there for you when you needed us. America needs you, and America needs the Oklahoma Standard. We all live by it.”He also joked that he felt more able to be candid now. “I’m old and can’t run for anything any more,” Clinton said. “I’m almost as old as President Trump.”Explore more on these topicsOklahoma CityBill ClintonFar right (US)US crimeOklahomaDemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

But with scandal-plagued incumbent Eric Adams sitting out the primary– he may run as an independent – the Ugandan-born Mamdani is in with a chance undera new ranked-choice voting system.“Zohran is breaking away as a clear second place and the alternative to the disgraced ex-governor Andrew Cuomo whose campaign is a house of cards,” Mamdani spokesperson Andrew Epsteintold theGothamistnews sitelast week.He added that the campaign has been successful so far by “being everywhere all of the time,” with more than 10,000 volunteers knocking on more than 100,000 doors, and by pushing out a platform of affordability, of rent freezes, free metro transport and city-run grocery stores – as well as the creation of a department of community safety to invest in citywide mental health programs and crisis response.Mamdani’s emergence as a viable candidate comes as another New York Democrat Socialist, congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, currently on a packed-out “Fighting Oligarchy” tour of the US, is being touted as the new face of the national party.Mamdani “represents the city of the future – a more Asian city, a more Muslim city, and what could be a more leftwing city,” says Democrat campaign veteran Hank Sheinkopf.With New York City ­containing about 800,000 Muslims, with 350,000 believed to be registered to vote, this could be the year that they show their power. “Every group shows its power in New York at some point because urban power in the US is all about competition for resources,” Sheinkopf adds.Mamdani is the son of Mira Nair, the Academy Award nominated film director ofSalaam Bombay!; his father,Mahmood Mamdani,is a professor at Columbia who studies ­colonialism. Around the family ­dinner table they would discuss Darfur and other political topics. Before ­running for office, Mamdani worked as a counsellor, a rapper under the name “Mr. Cardamom” and as a cricketer.As a lawmaker, he’s introduced a bill to eliminate tax exemptions for the city’s biggest universities, Columbia and NYU, arguing that the tax funds should go to underfunded public universities; and has said there is a “ceiling” on the power of representation in identity politics because “people cannot feed themselves and their family on someone looking like them”.When theObservercaught up with him at an anti-Tesla protest, he said “it was important that when we turn the page on Elon Musk, we also turn the page on all those who empowered and emboldened the accumulation of this kind of wealth through public policy and public subsidy”.Mamdani said New Yorkers “have a role to play in fighting back against the wealthiest man in the world, who has purchased the president of the United States. It’s critically important that we do so, and we show ourselves standing alongside New Yorkers from all walks of life who are saying that this cannot happen on our watch and our dime.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cuomo, a moderate Democrat, has gone to great lengths to portray antisemitism as a central campaign issue, calling it “the most serious and the most important issue” in New York , and portraying himself as a “hyper aggressive supporter of Israel and proud of it”.Mamdani has the capacity to win, says Sheinkopf, but his anti-Israel stance could be a problem: “Is Mamdani’s run a worthwhile demonstration of how healthy a democracy is? Yes. But he’s got to convince people his ­behaviour is within the bounds of what [they] consider appropriate.”Explore more on these topicsNew YorkThe ObserverDemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

After Trump returned to the Oval Office in January, Musk has overseen brutal federal budget and staffing cuts overseen by the president’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), giving him what Guzman has described as a “controversial omnipresence in the media landscape”.That observation falls in line with some public opinion polling that hassuggestedstrong disapproval of the work Musk has done for Trump. A Quinnipiac University survey released in March showed that 60% of voters look down on the way that the businessman and Doge “are dealing with workers employed by the federal government”. Stock in Teslaslumpedamid the backlash. And there were subsequently reports that Musk would gradually shift away from his prominent place within theTrump administration.“The impact of association with influential figures in today’s heavily divided environment cannot be understated, especially with a deeply polarizing leader like … Musk,” Guzman wrote in a summary of the index’s findings.Yet an even greater threat to brands were earning stories that feature “creating deepfakes, misinformation, biased decision-making or unethical applications that cause harm or manipulate public perception”, the survey said. Attracting that kind of coverage was reportedly viewed “as the most likely to gain negative online news attention”, the survey added.An unnamed council member reportedly said: “AI, if not understood or managed in companies, can have an incredible trickle-down effect that may not be reversible.” One of the group’s experts noted that organizations these days need to regard AI policies as equally standard to those that account for more mundane aspects of their operations.Rolling back diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives aiming “to ensure fair treatment and full participation for all individuals” was labeled brands’ third top risk. The Trump administration has aggressively moved to eliminate such measures within the government, military and beyond, including at Harvard, where the White House recently axed more than $2bn infederal research fundingafter the university refused to end DEI programs, one of several demands from the president.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their attorney, Mark Geragos, planned to ask theLos Angelescounty judge Michael Jesic to reduce Erik and Lyle Menendez’s charges to manslaughter, which would allow them to be released from prison immediately.But as has often been the case in the brothers’ decades-long fight for release, it was not so straightforward. After a tense day in court, the Los Angeles county judge Michael Jesic delayed the proceedings until next month in response to the disputes between the defense and prosecution.“Today was a little bit disappointing for us as a family,” Anamaria Baralt, the brothers’ cousin, toldNBC Los Angelesoutside the courthouse on Thursday. “There have been some delays in this process that were unforeseeable, like the wildfires, that, of course, we have great patience for. This is another delay that is not so much, but we will continue to show up as a family.”In the last year, the brothers have hadnew hopefor the possibility of their release after a wave of public support, as well as the former Los Angeles district attorney’s announcement that he would recommend they be resentenced, and a decision from the governor to order the parole board to determine whether they would pose a risk to the public if they were released.In 1996,Erik, now 54, and Lyle, now 57, were convicted of first-degree murder in the shotgun killings of José Menendez, an entertainment executive, and Kitty Menendez. A judge sentenced them to life in prison without parole. The brothers had said they feared their parents were going to kill them to cover up years of sexual, psychological and physical abuse they had suffered at the hands of their father. Prosecutors portrayed the brothers as wealthy young men who killed to obtain their multimillion-dollar inheritance, and have argued they were not abused.They have recently sought freedom through multiple legal avenues, including by asking for a new trial in light of new evidence of their father’s abuse, a petition for clemency from the governor, and a request for resentencing. And last year, for the first time since their convictions, it began to appear they could have a meaningful shot at freedom. Adocumentaryand a popular – albeitcontroversial–Netflix serieshighlighted their stories and accounts of abuse and they received support from criminal justice reform advocates, includingKim Kardashian.George Gascón, the progressive former Los Angeles county district attorney, recommended the brothers be resentenced to 50 years to life, which would have made them immediately eligible for release underCalifornialaw. He said he believed the brothers were “subjected to a tremendous amount” of dysfunction and molestation, and argued they had paid their debt to society. He pointed to their behavior in prison, where they have earned college degrees and served as mentors and caregivers.But Gascón lost his seat to Nathan Hochman in November, and the new district attorney said he would not support resentencing and asked the court to rescind his predecessor’s motion. He argued the brothers have not taken full responsibility for their crimes and his office has said it does not believe they were abused.The brothers’ family, the majority of whom support their release, have been highly critical of the new DA, and asked that he be removed from the case. They said he is “incapable of handling this process with the fairness, care, or neutrality required by law”.This week’s hearing unfolded with the family in attendance as well as the brothers, who watched the proceedings via video from a state prison near San Diego.Hochman’s office had sought to delay this week’s proceedings, which were postponed in January because of the Los Angeles wildfires, to allow the court to obtain part of the comprehensive risk assessments completed by the state parole board.“If there is a report out there assessing the risk of violence, how do we not use it?” Habib Balian, the deputy district attorney, said in court on Thursday.The judge ultimately decided to postpone the proceedings to allow the prosecution and defense time to review the document, which the governor’s office has said is not a stand-alone risk assessment. The hearing in May will also look at a pending request from the brothers’ attorney, Geragos, on whether the district attorney’s office should be recused from the case.Geragos had denounced the district attorney for discussing the risk assessment report in a morning news conference. He said Hochman’s treatment of the case was “appalling”, and he and attorney Bryan Freedman, who represents Menendez relatives, were particularly critical of prosecutors’ decision in a hearing last week to show, without warning, a graphic crime scene photo of José Menendez while relatives were present.“That’s not dignity,” Freedman said. “That’s disrespect. That’s harassment.”Balian apologized for not warning the family about the image, but said: “Erik and Lyle Menendez caused that carnage, not me.”The family has said the act “retraumatized” them and led to the hospitalization, in critical condition, of Terry Baralt, José’s sister, who is 85 and has cancer. “This wasn’t just cruel. It was a clear violation of our rights,” the family said in astatement.“Our forgiveness for Erik and Lyle does not erase our grief. It does not mean we don’t mourn José and Kitty. It means we believe that people can grow. That trauma begets trauma,” the statement continued. “And yet this District Attorney’s Office seems determined to punish us for that humanity.”The next hearing for the brothers is scheduled for 9 May.The Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsLos AngelesCaliforniaWest CoastUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

The highs – getting to dress up in a posh frock – were levelled by the lows: being on the receiving end of racist police treatment for entering a segregated theatre.View image in fullscreenBest buddies … Ncuti Gatwa (left) and Varada Sethu supposedly in Miami but actually in Penarth.Photograph: James Pardon/BBC Studios/Bad WolfLinus Roache put in an affecting bit-part turn as Reginald Pye, the man who, exposed to the power of Mr Ring-a-Ding, trapped himself in the cinema as the only means of reliving precious moments with his late wife. His zeal for setting fire to old film canisters at the end might have been quite stressful for veteran Doctor Who fans who still lament the BBC’s failure to preserve similar cans containingnearly 100 missing episodesfrom the 1960s.View image in fullscreenAffecting … Linus Roache as Reginald Pye in the film store.Photograph: James Pardon/BBC Studios/Bad WolfThe show has tacitly acknowledged its own fandom before, by effectively putting Ingrid Oliver’s Osgood character on screen in Doctor Who cosplay, but the extended fourth-wall break in Lux took it to another level. It was a scene that managed to move the plot on, and act as showrunner Russell T Davies’ love letter to what Doctor Who has meant to so many people over so many decades.If there were any weaknesses, then Belinda could surely have run up those cinema steps faster when the Doctor was seemingly being dragged to his doom, and the resolution, as is often the case in this era, was a little hand-wavey. However, in its own way that was also quite moving, as Mr Ring-a-Ding grew into an “Ugly Sonic” version of the character, and then transcended space and time in a setup reminiscent of the end of 2001: A Space OdysseySum it up in one sentence?What if Doctor Who was likeWho Framed Roger Rabbit?, with the audience also in it …Life aboard the TardisMaybe we overestimated the idea that the relationship between Belinda and the Doctor was going to be spikier than last year’s instant friendship between Gatwa and Millie Gibson’s Ruby Sunday. By the time they’d escaped being trapped as animations, these two were firmly in best buddy territory. This may be a factor of only having eight episodes a season instead of 13. The show doesn’t seem to have the space for a slow-burn build of trust these days.Fear factorDon’t make him laugh. Frankly, there may have been slightly too much revealed about Mr-Ring-A-Ding in the advance publicity, but him suddenly reprising the vocal motif of the Stooky Bill doll from60th anniversary special The Gigglehad at least been held back, and it was a genuinely jaw-dropping moment. Alan Cumming’s voice work trod a fine line between him being a malevolent godlike antagonist, and simply a fun-loving cartoon guy that had come alive by chance and just wanted to see the wider world beyond the auditorium, even if it did mean trapping people on celluloid along the way.View image in fullscreenMr Ring-a-Ding, voiced by Alan Cumming.Photograph: BBC Studios/Disney/Bad WolfMysteries and questionsWe can be in no doubt that the show has veered far away from hard sci-fi and into the broadest of fantasy territories, as the Doctor faces a pantheon of gods that transcend the universe. Which god will he face next? And, right on cue, there was dear old Anita Dobson as Mrs Flood again, who had somehow also got herself to 1950s Miami in time for the denouement of the episode.

Instead,Come and Get It– which is published in paperback next month – fulfils the promise, pursuing some of the themes of that first work while also daring to be boldly different.The story unfolds at the University of Arkansas, where wealth, class and race shape the yearnings and anxieties of a group of students and one equally flawed visiting professor. Reid, who has been teaching at the University of Michigan, is currently preparing to move to the Netherlands with her husband and young daughter. She is also on the judging panel for this year’s Booker prize.What inspiredCome and Get It?I was teaching an undergraduate fiction writing workshop and was intrigued by my students. They were smart and bizarre and strange, and their voices got stuck in my head. Around that time, my husband gifted me a book calledPaying for the Party: HowCollege Maintains Inequality, written by two sociologists who lived on a university campus and tracked young women’s finances. I’m fascinated by money and began interviewing students about it, and that’s how the novel started.Money also features powerfully inSuch a Fun Age, even though that novel was discussed almost exclusively in terms of race, right?Such a Fun Agecame out on the last day of 2019, and the following summer George Floyd was murdered. I think a lot of black artists had to contend with the role of their work in the hands of people who believed that if they purchased black art they were solving a bit of racism. The truth is, to separate race from money is to miss the point entirely. The reason that the median income of black families is so low is due to slavery. I will continue to believe that consumption cannot fix racism, but in terms of what my books are doing, that’s always up to the reader.From voice to architecture of thought, James Baldwin is just compelling all roundIs a novel’s theme something you consider as you’re writing?Theme always comes last. I never say, I want to write about capitalism or women. What gets me into writing is always this tiny moment of someone saying something that’s stuck with me. I also hate polemics within a book. I just want a novel to present fiction as truth to me, and then let me make up my own mind, because life is so complicated.If theme comes last, what comes first?For me, it’s always story. When friends recommend books and say the first 50 pages are really boring but then it gets good, I say absolutely not! You have to grab me with a story, that’s the only reason I pick up a book. I think it’s story followed by character and then voice.You capture your characters’ voices so clearly inCome and Get It, the tone almost becomes documentary-like. Did anything that students told you when you interviewed them make it on to the page?A young woman told me that she received paycheques through her father’s dentist’s office, and I asked her if she worked there and she said no, they’re “practice paycheques”. I said, you know that sounds like fraud? And she was like, “Oh no, it’s totally fine.” That went straight into the book – Practice Paycheques was almost its title. I use things that I hear in the real world in my fiction all the time. It’s all up for grabs as far as I’m concerned.You have a gift for finding redeeming traits in characters that it might be tempting to villainise…I hope that I’m generous towards my characters. My favourite kind of heartbreak within a novel is when you know a character knows better. I love characters who you feel like shaking a bit because that rings very true to real life for me.How are you feeling about writing your third book in the Netherlands, immersed in a language other than English?I have to learn Dutch very quickly! Studying other languages is really beneficial for me. When I was writingSuch a Fun Age, I took a German class four days a week and honestly, it was good practice to be bad at something first thing in the morning. When I got to my own writing later on, I wasn’t making the first mistakes of my day, which took the pressure way down.Talking of pressure, how long is your reading list for the Booker prize?About 160 novels. I allow myself to be very messy with my notes but there’s no scope for falling behind with the reading. I try to tackle two books in a day and almost make them compete against each other, spending an hour with one, then an hour with another… It’s pretty illuminating in terms of which one is really holding my attention.Tell me about the group dynamic on the judging panel.The group is absolutely lovely [the other Booker panellists for 2025 are chair Roddy Doyle, Ayòbámi Adébáyò, Sarah Jessica Parker and Chris Power] and I’m the grouch, I have no generosity. It’s difficult because some of the books have completely knocked me off my seat so I have a very high bar.Do you have a favourite winner from years past?I, like most people, enjoyed Paul Beatty’sThe Sellout[2016] very much, and I lovedThis Other Edenby Paul Harding, which was shortlisted [in 2023].In your wider reading, is there an author you return to time and again?James Baldwin. On my desk are copies ofThe Fire Next Time,Notes of a Native Son, andAnother Country. From voice to architecture of thought, he’s just compelling all round. I did a monologue fromBlues for Mister Charliefor an acting class aged 19. I don’t imagine my performance was very compelling at all, but it was how I discovered James Baldwin.Did you grow up wanting to be a writer?Cleaning out my childhood bedroom, I found a list from when I was around 10 of things I would like to do before I was 40, and alongside “kiss a boy at a football game” was “publish a book”. I’m happy to say that I’ve done a few of the other ones as well.Is there anything on your bookshelves that readers would be surprised to find?Ginger tea and a ton of index cards. Probably a third ofCome and Get Itstarted out on index cards. On days when it seems like there’s not enough time or possibly inspiration, it’s way less pressure to say I’m going to write six index cards today, that’s it.Come and Get Itby Kiley Reid is published in paperback by Bloomsbury (£9.99).

My father is from a royal family in Nigeria, so I interpreted it that way. Remarkably, she was right: I went on to play King Pelasgus, Henry VI, Martin Luther King and Seretse Khama.My earliest memoryis sitting on my dad’s shoulders as he walked down Balham High Street in London. I was eating a cream puff, watching the sugar fall into his hair. I can still smell and taste the cream. It felt magical, both the longest and the shortest walk imaginable.We movedfrom the UKto Nigeria,where I attended a military-style boarding school for three years. There were lashings and I was made to cut an entire field with a cutlass. Those formative years were character-building and made me value the wisdom of elders, but the idea of subjecting my own children to that is inconceivable.When we returnedto the UK, we lived in a hostel for a time. Mum was coping with a lot of challenges, but she was a joyful person and always made our environment feel like we were kings again.My wife[actor Jessica Oyelowo] was told her IQ is off the charts during an assessment for ADHD. Now, she’s a member of Mensa. Our four children are neurodiverse, too. They have incredibly special attributes that they wear as superpowers. I’m in awe that I get to be their father.Any lasting relationshipneeds non-negotiables.We made the decisionearly on never to be apart for longer than two weeks: 26 years married and we’ve only broken that rule once, by 11 hours, when my wife was inSleepy Hollow. If I ever meet [director] Tim Burton, I’ll be having words.Never let the sungo down on your wrath. We won’t go to bed if a disagreement isn’t resolved – sleep makes it grow like cancer. Before you know it, you don’t remember why you were fighting, ego and pride becomes a factor, and then it starts to fall apart.God has neverlet me down. He’s a key factor in guiding my decisions and feeling safe within them. My wife and I suffered three miscarriages, one of them quite late in the pregnancy. Without faith, we would have retreated into our own corners to lick our wounds, but our love increased.Sidney Poitier, a hero of mine, was full of compliments and respect when we met. I mustered up the courage to say hello and to tell him what he means to me, but instead he started talking about my work. I still doubt myself that it happened, but I have the photograph.Oprah Winfreyplayed my mother inThe Butler.In one scene, she slaps me across the face, which was nerve-racking, because with each take she was gaining in confidence. Oprah taught me that the intention with which you do something manifests in the thing itself. If your intentions are pure, the chances are that it will be edifying both for you and the people you’re doing it for.Success is subjective.It can sometimes mean coming away from something that failed, knowing you gave your best. That has been a guiding and guarding principle for me and has stood me in very good stead.Government Cheese is available to stream globally on Apple TV+Explore more on these topicsActingThis much I knowTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She has starred in films includingAtonementandSuffragette, and TV seriesThe HourandThe Miniaturist. Her directorial debut, the horror filmAmulet, was released in 2020. Last year Garai portrayedAnnie ErnauxinEline Arbo’s adaptation ofThe Yearsat the Almeida theatre, later transferring to the Harold Pinter theatre, for which she won best actress in a supporting role at the 2025 Olivier awards. Now she stars alongside Ivanno Jeremiah and Jamelia in new BBC Three comedy drama,Just Act Normal, available on iPlayer.1.Short storiesShe’s Always Hungry by Eliza ClarkView image in fullscreenEliza Clark.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The ObserverI’m not usually a fan of the short story – I often find them not very fulfilling. But I really like Eliza Clark as a writer, so I was excited to read these. The stories are great and very funny: there’s such weird and dark humour in them. There’s one story particularly, called The King, which is about an alien living in the body of an ad executive. And at the end of the world they form a new civilisation. It’s a really witty pastiche on gender relations, and quite horrific, but extremely enjoyable.2.DanceVollmond, Sadler’s WellsView image in fullscreenMaria Giovanna Delle Donne in Vollmond by Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch and Terrain Boris Charmatz at Sadler’s Wells.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianI saw this about a month ago. I’m a huge fan of Pina Bausch and I always try to go when her company, Tanztheater Wuppertal, is performing. I’d not seen this piece before, and the dancing in it was unbelievably daring. There’s a whole section at the end where the stage is full of water and the dancers have to run backwards and forwards through it. Quite a few of the dancers fell over – it’s amazing to see people who are so committed to what they’re doing that they’re putting themselves in physical danger to achieve it.3.SongSay It Like You Mean It by Sleater-KinneyView image in fullscreenCarrie Brownstein, left, and Corin Tucker of Sleater-Kinney.Photograph: Chris HornbeckerThis song does something weird to me. I quite often play it when I’m running, and then I start running really fast, like I’m chasing a mugger. It makes me feel intensely euphoric. It’s a really sad song – Carrie Brownstein lost her mum in a car accident in 2022, so it’s about grief and saying goodbye – but very beautiful. I’ve loved Sleater-Kinney for many years. All the music I like is sad – I don’t like any upbeat music. But this song is incredibly purifying in its expression of grief.4.TVYellowjacketsWatch a trailer for Yellowjackets.The glut of television makes it hard to find things I really want to watch, but this show has struck me profoundly. It’s about a group of women who go through an unbelievably extreme experience early on together, and it looks at the way they recover from trauma. They try to rationalise it, react against it, commodify the experience. It’s truthful and brilliant. There’s a scene in which one of the younger actresses, Sophie Nélisse, gives birth in the wilderness – it’s a feat of acting. I don’t understand why they haven’t all won the top acting awards.5.PodcastThe Rest Is History – The French RevolutionI’m a big history geek so I love this podcast. It’s like you’re sitting around a campfire. They’re very good at bringing history to life in a vivid way. The one they recently did about the French Revolution was just incredible, particularly the ones on Marie Antoinette and what happened to her. They talk about revolution, and what happens to ideas when they’re co-opted by the worst kinds of people, and excesses of ideology. When an ideology takes over, it’s never really about the idea – the idea is to end up in charge.6.PlaceAbney Park Cemetery, Stoke Newington, LondonView image in fullscreenAbney Park Cemetery in London.Photograph: James Osmond/AlamyAbney Park Cemetery is a mysterious and beautiful place that’s been allowed to go somewhat wild. We have lots of lovely parks in London, but not that many wild places. You can walk around and hear woodpeckers and it feels very much like it’s part of nature. Because it’s full of trees, you see the passing of the seasons amazingly. And you can read the headstones – your brain is constantly whirring, thinking about all the titbits you get. There’s one that I love where it says: “Died in an accident.” And always, I’m like: “What accident?”7. HotelLe Cottage Bise, FranceView image in fullscreenLe Cottage Bise on Lake Annecy.Photograph: LabonWe stayed in this hotel on the shores of Lake Annecy in a town called Talloires. It’s been there since the turn of the last century. In the morning, when you have breakfast, you sit on a terrace which looks up at the Alps. Then you can walk 50 feet and just get into the lake and swim. The lake is like Evian water – it’s the most unbelievably beautiful water to swim in. They have kayaks and pedalos. It’s one of the nicest places I’ve ever been.Explore more on these topicsRomola GaraiOn my radarDanceTelevisionPodcastsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His 2015Rockyspin-offCreedrepresents the gold standard when it comes to franchise-wrangling, honouring the original series yet standing up and fighting its own corner as a distinct movie. If anyone has earned the chance to make a passion project, it’s Coogler. But who knew that this would result in something as wild, untrammelled and thrillingly unpredictable asSinners? Starring Michael B Jordan in the dual role of 1930s gangster twins Smoke (surly, threatening) and Stack (charming, reckless), it’s a sweltering, sexy southern gothic horror, a blues-infused vampire flick in which the music flows as freely as the blood.The brothers leave Chicago with the kind of cash that usually comes with a body count. Back in their Mississippi homeland, they team up with a young cousin, aspiring bluesman Sammie (Miles Caton, an impressive newcomer with deep, rich bourbon-soaked voice). The plan: to open a Black-owned juke joint under the noses of the Ku Klux Klan. But it turns out that an even greater evil awaits them.If you pick apart the story threads,Sinnersis a little messy, but Coogler’s assurance and vision holds everything together. It looks phenomenal: shot on 70mm film, the frame throbs with sultry, come-hither reds and golds. The soundtrack is hot-headed and dangerous – and not just the blues. There’s a feverish, feral version of the Irish folk song Rocky Road to Dublin that still gives me goose bumps a full week later.In UK, Irish and Australian cinemasWatch a trailer for Sinners.Explore more on these topicsFilmThe ObserverHorror filmsRyan CooglerMichael B JordanBlack PantherMarvelCreedreviewsShareReuse this content"

Never sailed the Aegean. A cross-channel ferry was enough for Joseph Mallord William Turner to understand the might and majesty of the sea. His 1803 painting Calais Pier records his feelings on his first arrival in France as foaming green mountains of waves look as if they’re about to sweep away the frail wooden jetty where passengers from England are expected to disembark. He is fascinated and appalled by the water, so solid in its power but always shifting, dissolving, sheering away.If JMW Turner, born250 years agothis spring, is Britain’s greatest artist – and he is – it is partly because he is so intensely aware of a defining fact about his country: it’s an island. For Turner, Britain is bordered by death, terror and adventure. Just one step from shore takes you into a world of peril. In the Iveagh Seapiece, fishers are hauling up their boats on a soaking beach while a wave like a wall surges towards them. One fishing boat is still out on the wild waters, so near to shore yet so far from safety.Island artist though he is, Turner’s imagination is the opposite of insular. It takes in lost civilisations and ancient myths, mountains he crossed and seas he never did. The wars that started with the French Revolution in 1789 had imprisoned Britain behind the Royal Navy’s “wooden walls”. When a short-lived peace broke out, the young landscape artist took his chance to travel, seeing a wine festival in Mâcon, gazing in awe at Mont Blanc – to judge from paintings he showed the next year. Before he ever saw the continent, he painted legendary Italy. All his life, he would keep up Europhile painterly pilgrimages to Venice and Rome, Heidelberg and the Saint Gotthard Pass.Turner was born near Covent Garden, London, on 23 April 1775, in a Britain that seemed a much bigger place than it does now. Every distance was vaster, every road felt longer. It took several days to get from London to Chester, Newcastle or Exeter. There was terra incognita at the end of your lane. When the young Turner set out on sketching tours – to Wales in 1792, the north of England in 1797 – these were journeys in a mysterious land.View image in fullscreenJMW Turner’s Calais Pier, 1803.Photograph: The National Gallery, LondonTouring Britain and Europe, returning with full sketchbooks, painting in his London studio – this was Turner’s life. He showed such talent for art he was accepted into the Royal Academy Schools at 14. He never knew failure and once his career got going in the 1790s, never needed to fear poverty. He was an artistic mountain, a formidable mass of productivity, who left reams of drawings and watercolours and prints as well as oil paintings, much of it bequeathed to the nation when he died in 1851. But, outside his work, you can’t really make much of Turner as a character. He slept with women but never married, built a house near the Thames, kept working, made a last home in Chelsea with his lover Sophia Booth, died there in view of the Thames. His soul is in his art.It is also our soul. Turner shows us our land as a place of wonder and possibility. And he’s not entirely making it up. In the golden yellow watercolour of Durham, painted around 1835, he has turned the cathedral with its twin Norman towers through 45 degrees to fit the view better and bestowed upon it the same honeyed sunlit radiance he might to a scene in Italy. But he also records the truth. On the bridge in the foreground are small figures that might be tired travellers looking for food, work, shelter who see the dazzling cathedral above them. That’s his message. We may think we live in a crushed, unjust place and time but look up and see the light and you can be uplifted by sudden beauty, irradiated by hope.His vision of a world torn between tragedy and possibility stretches from everyday observation to bloody myth. In his 1811 painting Apollo and Python, the Greek god of light and reason has just killed a scaly monster embodying the irrational. But it’s an empty victory, for we glimpse other serpentine horrors still lurking in the tangled woody landscape. In his greatest single image of myth, Ulysses Deriding Polyphemus: Homer’s Odyssey, an incandescent, smoky seascape off the coast of Sicily is the setting as the one-eyed giant cyclops rages atop Etna and the Greek hero and his crew laughingly escape the blinded monster. But the flaming sky is a false promise of freedom. Polyphemus calls on his father, Neptune, for vengeance: the sea god will wipe out Ulysses’ men and delay his homecoming.How did Turner become so familiar with the classics? It’s tempting to see him as a working-class hero but he did not stand outside elite culture. He grew up at a time when the commercial competition and artistic daring of Hogarth, Gainsborough, Stubbs and Wright had made British art come alive. As a pupil at the Royal Academy schools, he was expected to draw from plaster casts of classical art as well as absorb the erudite references of contemporary artists such as Richard Wilson and Joshua Reynolds.Artwas Turner’s education in an age of educated art.View image in fullscreenJMW Turner’s The Fighting Temeraire, 1839.Photograph: The National Gallery, LondonHis age was also the Romantic age, when nature was embraced like a religion. Turner started showing at the Royal Academy’s annual shows in the 1790s, when poets were experimenting with folk forms and hymning nature’s joys. Wordsworth and Coleridge published Lyrical Ballads in 1798 which included The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Lines Written a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey. Turner’s early art consciously aligns itself with the Romantic generation. In the same year that the Lakeside Poets broke through, he cunningly showed his view Morning Amongst the Coniston Fells.As a conscious Romantic he subscribed to theories of the picturesque and sublime and reckoned what he was doing was a kind of poetry. Landscape art had developed in the 17th century but was given new meaning in the Romantic age as nature became the bearer of intense ideals, when there was an equation of inner and outer states. Even music depicted landscape in Beethoven’s Pastoral Symphony.View image in fullscreenJMW Turner.Photograph: Print Collector/Getty ImagesTurner didn’t identify with the humble voice of a Wordsworth. His hero was Lord Byron, the most aristocratic, “immoral”, cynically observant, internationalist and political of Romantics. He even wrote his own Byronic poem, The Fallacies of Hope. He would travel to Venice and other Italian cities in emulation of Byron’s Childe Harold, aiming for the same blend of travel reportage and polemic. His painting of the gory aftermath of the Battle of Waterloo, a morass of slaughtered bodies under the light of a nocturnal flare, has an inscription quoting Byron’s account of the scene: “The earth is covered thick with other clay / Which her own clay shall cover, heaped and pent, / Rider and horse – friend, foe – in one red burial blent!” His identification with the poet shows the kind of artist he wanted to be: political and dangerous, an adventurer with a heart.Turner is as much a painter of time as light. He can make you marvel at the antiquity of rocks and buildings, how they have endured. History as survival fills his paintings of Caernarfon Castle or the Roman Forum. Yet he can show you sudden destruction that in an instant wipes away unchanging centuries.When the Houses of Parliament caught fire in 1834 he was on hand to paint the mass of red flame reflected in the Thames and the watching crowds, the centuries going up in smoke as the medieval heart of English government was destroyed. But do his paintings of this event mourn a disaster or rejoice in a new beginning? Two years previously the Great Reform Act had swept away much old rotten constitutional detritus. Turner may love the past but he thrills to change – even to the flames consuming the old order.This ambivalent eye for history is why Turner’s 250th birthday means so much. His dates have unusual significance. Born into a preindustrial world, he would live until 1851, the year of the Great Exhibition that celebrated Britain’s Victorian industrial might. The French Revolution and the wars it unleashed overshadow his early art. But he also witnessed the Industrial Revolution and revelled in its new energies. Industry is never just a blight for Turner, more a release of natural forces (which, scientifically, is what it was). Steam rules the waves in Staffa, Fingal’s Cave, which delights in the paradox that sightseers are taken to see an ancient natural wonder by a modern technological marvel, puffing its way through the waves.The passing away of the old and the careless brightness of the future collide in his 1839 canvas The Fighting Temeraire. The world of Turner’s youth is gone: one of its last relics, a ship of the line that fought at Trafalgar, is being towed to its last resting place on a Thames with shimmering bronzed waters to rival any of his mythic seas.View image in fullscreenJMW Turner’s Slavers Throwing Overboard the Dead and Dying (Typhoon Coming On), 1840.Photograph: AlamyThe Thames was the first stretch of water Turner saw. Its tidal reaches were surely where he first intuited the mystery of water, its instability. On it nothing is solid and there is no protector. Turner is supposed to have said in his dying hours, “The Sun is God!” If so, the sea is the devil. Ever since it was unveiled in 1840, Slavers Throwing Overboard the Dead and Dying (Typhoon Coming On) has been recognised as his supreme masterpiece. The wealthy father of Turner’s critical champion, John Ruskin, bought it for his son. Ruskin revered the painting but could not live with it, and not just because of the human content. This is Turner’s most harrowing sky, stained with bloody crimsons and purples, a vomitous natural wonder, its lurid light infecting the gas-green waves where monster fish swarm. Then there is that human content: legs and arms in the water, weighted by iron manacles and chains. It is not the sky and sea that are sick after all but the type of human society represented by the ship. Nature is not divine or cursed. But what of us?Turner: In Light and Shade review – bathe in the redemptive power of landscape artRead moreBritain had abolished the slave trade in 1807 and most Victorians were content to congratulate themselves on this. Why rake up the past? It took the imagination of Turner to return to the true story of the Zong, a slave ship out of Liverpool whose crew murdered more than 130 enslaved Africans in 1781, and make this horror as immediate, undying – and British – as the Fighting Temeraire.What is Turner’s legacy? You could call him the Rembrandt of the sea, or the Leonardo of landscape – he has the universality and complexity of these artists. He loved to compete with the old masters, painting versions of Dutch sea-pieces and Claude’s Italian scenes.The occasional sniffy critic claims Constable is more honest and real, or sees Turner’s prodigious output as bombastic and eccentric. But Turner knows what he is doing. He wants painting to simultaneously touch the soul, arouse the senses and challenge the mind with the most serious meditations on history, politics, even time and space. When the Hubble space telescope and now the James Webb telescope started sending back data, this was translated by Nasa into smoky, sublime images of deep space by which we now navigate our cosmos. What do these Romantic nebulae most resemble? Turner’s paintings, of course.Turner 250, a year-long festival of events, is running now at theTate Britain, London;Turner Contemporary, Margate, and galleries around the UK.Explore more on these topicsJMW TurnerArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the skincare industry has recently exploded with thousands of new products, while skincare influencers have been racking up millions of views with often bewildering (and conflicting) advice.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.So, should you be putting snail slime or beef tallow on your face, like that video you saw on TikTok? And which products are safe for your teenager to use, if any? We spoke to eight dermatologists to find out their own skincare routines – and which mistakes they see most often. Spoiler: none of them use snail slime.‘I wish I’d known my skin was beautiful when I was younger’Dr Angela Tewari, consultant dermatologist at King’s Collegehospital, London, and founder of theDermatology StudiosWhat’s your daily skincare routine?At the moment I’m using a mildglycolic wash from Tropic, which contains jojoba oil, because I’m prone to dry skin. I then use aDNA repair serum by Neova, which has a number of encapsulated enzymes that fight off residual sun damage, followed byPhyto A+ Brightening Treatmentby SkinCeuticals, which enhances radiance. This is followed byClinique’s Moisture Surge Sheertint Hydrator SPF 25.What’s your bargainbeauty buy?Nivea body lotion Q10. It contains nourishing almond oil and I feel I’m rejuvenating my body.Which beautytrend would you never recommend trying, and why?Snail mucin – it contains hyaluronic acid, but putting snails on your face or using their slime is not my cup of tea. There are cheaper ways of getting moisture into the skin with a more generic hyaluronic acid.What skincare do you recommend for children – and what should they stay away from?They should be avoiding glycolic acids, high-dose salicylic acid and retinoids – anything that would increase the turnover of their skin cells. Until our early 20s, our skin turnover is excellent, so we do not need to accelerate this at a younger age.Whattreatment/gadgetwould you blow the bank on?I’ve found theLightinderm LED devicevery helpful. You insert capsules of DNA repair enzymes into it and these are activated by the wavelengths it produces. This enables repair of any sun-induced changes and pigmentation, and it lifts skin. The device costs £400.What skincare advice would you give your younger self?I wish I’d known that, actually, my skin is beautiful, but it’s very hard to realise that at the time – we always think we look a lot worse than we do.What’s the product you can’t live without?DNA Total Repair serumbyNeova. It goes on the skin after washing and improves radiance while reducing fine lines and helping with pigmentation.What’s the most common mistake you see?People going for filler when they really need a booster – polynucleotide injections are anti-inflammatory and promote collagen – and good skincare.What do you do that would surprise people?Sometimes if I’m very tired, after putting my three children to bed, I don’t take my makeup off before going to sleep. Ideally, you should remove those layers of dirt and pollution at night, as we know they contribute to oxidative stress and skin damage.‘Advice to my younger self? Don’t waste money on luxury brands’Dr Ophelia Veraitch,consultant dermatologistat101 Harley Streetand University College London Hospitals NHSfoundationtrustWhat’s your daily skincare routine?During my morning shower, I cleanse withCetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser. Then I apply one of myHyperpigmentation Day Serums, a prescription product to target pigmentation, which I am prone to. Next, I apply theSkinceuticals Skin Brightening SPF 30. At night-time, I use theSkinceuticals Blemish + Age Cleanser Geland apply myDr Ophelia Acne Night Serum, which helps prevent congestion.What’s your bargainbeauty buy?The Cetaphil cleanser is gentle and suitable for my whole family, including a daughter with mild eczema and a son who is beginning to develop mild acne.Cetraben Moisturising Lotionis suitable for everyone’s face and body.Which beautytrend would you never recommend trying, and why?Collagen supplements – there are no high-quality scientific or clinical studies to suggest that ingesting collagen helps restore the lost collagen in our skin. Similarly,biotin supplements (taken to thicken hair)interfere with a large number of blood tests, including those used for diagnosing heart attacks and thyroid function. There is an FDA warning against biotin supplementation, and I have seen a number of patients with excessive hair shedding caused by taking these supplements.What skincare do you recommend for children – and what should they stay away from?My daughter recently turned 10, and I had offers from other parents to buy her skincare vouchers, which I politely declined on her behalf. I don’t want her getting obsessed with these trends that could damage her skin. She and my 12-year-old son both use Cetaphil in the shower, and Cetraben as a moisturiser. On occasion, I have given them stronger products to help get rid of patches of dry skin or breakouts of spots.Whattreatment/gadgetwould you blow the bank on?Once a year I haveThermage FLX– a radio frequency device that is very good for tightening and lifting the skin. It costs about £2,000 for a full face treatment and gives very natural, but definite, results. It’s good for those who aren’t open to surgical options; I’m finding that patients are wanting to go for cosmetic surgery less and less.What skincare advice would you give your younger self?Not to waste money on luxury brands. I suffered from awful acne and pigmentation when I was younger, despite always buying into the most expensive ranges. As a result, I am highly sensitive to many ingredients, which has taught me simple skincare with effective treatments is the best approach.What’s the product you can’t live without?A daily SPF.What’s the most common mistake you see?Only wearing an SPF in the summer rather than all year round; following skin influencers on social media instead of seeking proper professional help; rotating through many different skincare products.What do you do that would surprise people?I often go through long periods of just cleansing, then using an SPF. If serums for hyperpigmentation or acne work, you shouldn’t need to keep using them for ever!‘Even inside, if I am using a computer, I wear an SPF’Dr Tanja Phillips,laser and aesthetic medicine specialist at the HVN, alongside her own clinicWhat’s your daily skincare routine?ZO Skin Health is my go-to. I use itsexfoliating cleanserin the morning, which has tiny biodegradable beads to remove dead skin cells, followed by one ofZO’s Complexion Renewal Pads. Next, I apply itsFirming Serum, which has a lot of growth factors and peptides to stimulate new growth and improve skin barrier function. After that, I applyDaily Power Defense, which also helps to improve cell turnover, followed byHeliocare 360° Pigment Solution Fluid, which protects against UVA, UVB and HEV (blue light from devices). I’ve just started usingAWviproducts, which work with your gut and skin microbiome. I use theircleanser, serum and face creamin the evening, which comes with an oral dose of probiotics – you sprinkle them on your tongue to help regenerate skin from the inside out.What’s yourbargain beauty buy?CeraVe face washesare great – they’re unscented and uncomplicated, and have good clinical trials behind them. They’re very effective for anyone with combination skin or acne.Which beautytrend would you never recommend trying, and why?Lemon Bottle fat-dissolving injections. They’ve been huge on TikTok, and my clinics get a lot of calls requesting them, but for me, the answer has to be no – there aren’t any good clinical trials to suggest they are effective. Instead, I’d recommend injecting a product called Pluryal, which is very effective at breaking down the membrane of fat cells, helping to get rid of stubborn pockets such as back fat or love handles.What skincare do you recommend for children – and what should they stay away from?I love that children are interested in skin health, and I wouldn’t pooh-pooh their interest, but it doesn’t mean that they have to be obsessed. They just need a good, gentle facial wash (CeraVe is great), there’s no need for acids or exfoliants. Most young people don’t need any additional hydration, but I would recommend an SPF every single day from as young as possible. From about 20 they can start considering whether they might need a moisturiser, but most 20-year-olds won’t.View image in fullscreen‘It amazes me how many people don’t wash their face properly.’Whattreatment/gadgetwould you blow the bank on?I’m a big laser fan.Fotonais a collagen-stimulating laser, which is a natural way of improving cell turnover, and one of the few treatments that work on rosacea. For younger people, it can be great for treating excessive oiliness and acne. It’s versatile, safe, and delivers results with no need for downtime because it penetrates the glands without damaging the surface. It costs from about £550 for a treatment.What skincare advice would you give your younger self?I was a sun-worshipper – I wish I’d known to use SPF come rain or shine. I tell patients of every age that SPF will save them spending a fortune seeing people like me for pigmentation reduction, loss of collagen, and wrinkles. You can still tan while wearing SPF, just stay in the shade during the hottest part of the day.What’s the product you can’t live without?Other than my SPF, a good cleanser (such as the ZO Exfoliating Cleanser) to get rid of pollutants.What’s the most common mistake you see?It amazes me how many people don’t wash their face properly. I wouldn’t recommend using just cleanser and your fingers – you’d be surprised how much more comes off if you use a mitt or muslin cloth. I always recommend a double cleanse in the evening to prevent free radicals from damaging your skin overnight. Also, applying SPF from the middle of the face out and forgetting the edges. I see a lot of pigmentation towards the hairline where SPF hasn’t reached.What do you do that would surprise people?Even if I’m inside without any windows, if I am using a computer screen, I will wear an SPF to protect from HEV rays (blue light), which contribute to overall skin damage. When choosing an SPF it should protect against UVA, UVB and HEV rays.‘Homemade sunscreen is an absolute no – never do that!’Dr Aamna Adel, consultant dermatologist and skin and hair loss specialistWhat’s your daily skincare routine?I’ve got quite dry skin so I don’t use a cleanser first thing – for people with dry, sensitive skin, splashing your face with water in the morning is fine. I use theGarnier Micellar Cleansing Water, which hydrates my skin, followed bySkinCeuticals’ Dual Antioxidant Treatmentwith vitamin C. At the moment I’m using theBeauty Pie Triple Hyaluronic Acidcream to moisturise, and a sunscreen. I love La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400because it’s tinted. In the evening, I double cleanse usingCeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser. I use a prescription tretinoin, then aHaruharu Wonder Black Rice Bakuchiol Eye Cream, which is anti-ageing without being irritating.What’s your bargainbeauty buy?Nivea is a great budget sunscreen – it’s much cheaper than anything else on the market without any of the greasiness or chalkiness of cheaper brands.Which beautytrend would you never recommend trying, and why?People using beef tallow as an alternative to moisturiser. A lot of “natural” trends tend to do more harm than good. There’s no evidence that animal fat is particularly hydrating, and it’s more likely to cause irritation than a standard moisturiser. Homemade sunscreen is another absolute no – never do that!Be honest, have you had work? 11 people open up about what they do – or don’t do – to their faceRead moreWhat skincare do you recommend for children – and what should they stay away from?My daughter is two-and-a-half and she’s already interested in skincare – I think a lot of children watch their mums do a skincare routine and want to copy them. Children only need to use a cleanser and an SPF and moisturiser combo, for simplicity. In my clinic, I see a lot of young people who have damaged skin barriers from using products that aren’t designed for them. Early exposure to certain active ingredients, such as retinol and vitamin C, can lead to allergies in the long term.Whattreatment/gadgetwould you blow the bank on?There’s lots of data to suggest that LED masks help to stimulate collagen.CurrentBodyhas a good one. It costs £399.99.What skincare advice would you give your younger self?I wish I’d known to take my makeup off before bed when I was at university. It dries out the skin and leads to irritation.What’s the product you can’t live without?Eucerin UreaRepair Originalis my ride-or-die face cream. It’s great if you have dry skin, or just want to keep a baseline of hydration.What’s the most common mistake you see?Doing too much. Overcomplicated skincare routines lead to skin not being as healthy as it should be. There’s also a misconception that skincare alone can fix everything – when it comes to things like acne or rosacea, it’s better to seek professional advice early on. It’s much easier to treat acne with antibiotics or prescription retinoids than to treat acne scarring.What do you do that would surprise people?I don’t use retinol every day – the goal shouldn’t be to get to everyday use, it should be to get to a frequency that works for you. On average, I use it three times a week.‘I don’t reapply my SPF during the day.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWhat’s your daily skincare routine?I always advise people to keep it simple: a good cleanser, antioxidant and retinol. The cleanser should have salicylic acid – it works like a detergent to scoop out all the oil and dirt inside the pores, which can become blackheads (theZO Exfoliating Cleanserhas a high concentration). Then I apply an antioxidant vitamin C serum –SkinCeuticalshas a very good range. I wear SPF 30 during the daytime because I have very oily skin, so I can end up breaking out. At night I use aRetinol Skin Brightener from ZO.What’s your bargainbeauty buy?Eucerin moisturisersare nicely priced and not too oily – they work really well.Whichbeauty trend would you never recommend trying, and why?The “glass skin” trend encourages people to use whitening products designed for those experiencing melasma, which is pigmentation that appears during pregnancy. They contain hydroquinone, a bleaching agent used by people in a lot of Indian and African countries, that can lead to serious complications.What skincare do you recommend for children – and what should they stay away from?Children have thinner skin barriers, so it’s important to use sensitive products. I would recommend La Roche-Posay moisturiser and a spray SPF because it’s easier to apply if they hate being rubbed. For a teenager with oily skin and breakouts, I’d suggest a cleanser with salicylic acid, something likeClean & Clear. For young people with eczema, products with lactic acid are very moisturising.Whattreatment/gadgetwould you blow the bank on?A red-light treatment – the results are incredible. It stimulates circulation so it promotes healing, and can be used for hair loss. We usually combine it with other treatments: CO2, chemical peels or facials. Red-light treatments are quick and easy, so can be done from about £60 a session.What skincare advice would you give your younger self?Growing up in Brazil, I wish I’d known the importance of SPF – sun exposure is the cause of 80-90% of visible ageing. Some people are good at applying SPF to their face, but forget their arms. You risk not only dark pigmentation but white spots (loss of pigmentation), which you cannot get rid of.What’s the product you can’t live without?Retinol. As we age, our skin becomes lazy, which means a buildup of dead skin, which looks very dull and sallow. Retinol causes enough irritation to increase the speed of cell turnover. I would recommend retinol for everyone – sometimes people with sensitive skin think that they can’t use it, but it’s just a matter of using a lower dose and adapting.What’s the most common mistake you see?People like using very oily, buttery creams – expensive ones likeCrème de la Mer. They feel amazing when you apply them, but what you are doing is adding oil on top of dead skin cells, which encourages your skin to be even lazier and dull-looking. A lot of people have the impression that Dior or Chanel skincare is the best, but it doesn’t contain any active ingredients because they don’t want their consumers to complain that they’ve caused irritation.People often think that they’re allergic to products that are actually doing their job.What do you do that would surprise people?I don’t reapply my SPF during the day. I’m too lazy!‘Bottom line: smearing animal fat on your face isn’t the best idea’Dr Jonathan Kentley, consultant dermatologist at Montrose London and Chelsea and WestminsterhospitalWhat’s your daily skincare routine?In the morning I wash my face with warm water in the shower, then I use theDr Rossi Derm MD range, which contains a sea anemone peptide to prevent irritation.The range consists of anessence containing lactic acid and niacinamide,a serum with hyaluronic acidand atitanium dioxide-based mineral sunscreen. In the evening I’ll cleanse with a simpleCeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser, or a twice-weeklyhydroxy acid, which acts as an exfoliant. This is followed by the all-important tretinoin and a low-potency retinoid around the eyes (I likeskinbetter’s EyeMax AlphaRet Overnight Cream).What’s your bargainbeauty buy?I don’t believe you need to spend a huge amount on moisturisers. I’ll use one of the pharmacy brands like La Roche-Posay,AvèneorEucerinas they have ranges formulated for all skin types at a good price point – but evenNiveaandSimpleare absolutely fine.Which beautytrend would you never recommend trying, and why?The TikTok trend for applying beef tallow to the face has been pushed as a solution to many skin problems. Personally, I find this mad. Beef fat is really greasy and blocks pores, and I’ve seen a few patients come to the clinic with quite severe acne breakouts as a result. Bottom line: smearing animal fat on your face probably isn’t the best idea.What skincare do you recommend for children – and what should they stay away from?Keep it simple: sunscreen and a moisturiser if they are prone to dry skin. The trend for tweenagers to use actives like retinoids and hydroxy acids does more harm than good – they aren’t meant for immature skin.View image in fullscreen‘It’s never too soon to start using sunscreen.’Whattreatment/gadgetwould you blow the bank on?I was quite sceptical of LED face masks when they appeared on the market, but there is quite a lot of evidence that they are beneficial. I also like to do an annual non-ablative fractional laser. This essentially drills microscopic holes in your face and your body’s response is to create new collagen and elastin as a wound-healing response, leaving the skin with great tone and texture, and preventing fine lines.What skincare advice would you give your younger self?Definitely sunscreen. With 80-90% of visible ageing and the vast majority of skin cancers caused by UV exposure, it can never be too soon to start using it!What’s the product you can’t live without?Lanolips 101 Ointment. This rich hydrating cream is amazing as a lip balm as well as for dry patches on the hands, elbows or anywhere.What’s the most common mistake you see?Overdoing it! Patients often apply about 20 different actives and turn up to clinic with a carrier bag full of serums that are actually causing significant skin irritation. It’s important to stick to a few effective actives tailored to your individual skin needs.What do you do that would surprise people?If I’m being completely honest, I don’t wear SPF on a cloudy day in winter, especially if I’m going to be at work all day. Cancer-causing UVB rays are very low in winter, and even though UVA (which is responsible for ageing) is present all year round, it seems that in the UK it is at lower levels than previously thought. The amount of UVA I encounter on my morning commute is unlikely to cause much damage.‘Follow your skin type, not trends’Dr Sharon Belmo,clinical lead for skin of colour at theCentre of Evidence Based Dermatologyatthe University of NottinghamWhat’s your daily skincare routine?In the morning I wash my face withDr Naana Fresh Face Cleanser, which is packed with soothing and moisturising ingredients such as an oat-derived surfactant, aloe vera and glycerin. It has been tested on all skin types, which is a rarity. Afterwards, I applyRevision Skincare C+ Correcting ComplexandEpionce Renewal Facial Lotion, which is very moisturising without clogging the pores. My favourite sunscreen isColorescience Sunforgettable Total Protection Face Shield in bronze. In the evening, I use the same cleanser and renewal lotion.What’s your bargainbeauty buy?Eucerin Aquaphor– it’s the best for dry lips.Which beautytrend would you never recommend trying, and why?DIY or bargain injectables/fillers – these should only be performed by a licensed professional. Unfortunately, the market is very poorly regulated in the UK and there are many non-medical practitioners performing such procedures in beauty salons or even at home. To stay safe, choose a qualified medical professional, eg a dermatologist, cosmetic surgeon, GP, dentist or nurse, who is fully registered with the relevant professional body (for doctors, the General Medical Council; for nurses, the Nursing and Midwifery Council).What skincare do you recommend for children – and what should they stay away from?I did not think about skincare as a tween – I think it has gone too far. Less is more for most people, but particularly at this age. My daughter is five and I focus on hydration, with fragrance-free moisturisers such asCeraVe moisturising cream. Unless prescribed, I would not advise tweens to be using retinoids.Whattreatment/gadgetwould you blow the bank on?Microneedling – this is a great multifunctional treatment and can be used on all skin types. It uses tiny needles to create micro-injuries to the skin, boosting collagen, which can improve the texture and appearance of the skin. It can also be used to treat fine lines, acne scars and hyperpigmentation. It costs about £100-£300 a session (usually sold in packages).What skincare advice would you give your younger self?Sunscreen! The prominence of uneven skin tone and hyperpigmentation, as a result of exposure to UV light being so prominent in darker skin tones, was not discussed when I was younger.What’s the product you can’t live without?Epionce Renewal Facial Lotionis my go-to. It is light but packed with ceramides and hyaluronic acid, which help retain moisture levels.The cream versionis richer and perfect for winter or more mature skin.What’s the most common mistake you see?Using too many products, too many steps and over-exfoliating, all of which can lead to skin irritation. A basic routine is cleanser, antioxidant-based product, if you are using one, moisturiser, and sunscreen in the morning. Then, at night: cleanser, retinoid-based product, if you are using one, and moisturiser. There may be additional steps for specific concerns such as acne, ageing skin or hyperpigmentation but I would advise taking advice from a dermatologist, who may prescribe treatments that are multifunctional and more efficient.What do you do that would surprise people?I don’t use a retinoid/retinol! They’re great, but not for everyone. For some, they are too harsh and cause irritation. Follow your skin type, not trends.‘The best product? The one you like to wear every day’Dr RhysBeynon, GMC-registered aesthetic doctor with a background insurgery andemergencymedicineWhat’s your daily skincare routine?I like to keep things as simple as possible; the three essential products I recommend for most of my clients are sunscreen, vitamin C and retinol/tretinoin. In the shower, I cleanse usingAlumierMD’s SensiCalm Cleanserbefore applying its15% vitamin C serum, which helps with fine lines and wrinkles, boosts collagen and brightens the skin. I useLa Roche-Posay Anthelios Age Correct, an SPF, which also contains hyaluronic acid and niacinamide so I don’t need to add a moisturiser. In the evening, I use a prescription-only tretinoin, which improves skin texture and helps fight fine lines and wrinkles. I prefer prescription tretinoin to retinol because it is more potent and gives better results.What’s your bargainbeauty buy?CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanseris a perfect gentle cleanser that will refresh the skin without overstripping it or leaving it feeling tight and dry. It contains ceramides that help boost your skin’s natural barrier. I also loveThe Ordinary’s Azelaic Acid suspension 10%. Azelaic acid is a natural and effective antioxidant found in grains; I often recommend this product to clients who have redness, rosacea or acne. It also helps improve skin texture, so is a great anti-ageing treatment, too.Which beautytrend would you never recommend trying, and why?There are so many! But my main concern at the moment is about plasma pen treatments, which use an electrical current to heat the skin, causing it to contract and tighten. If done incorrectly, this can cause bad scarring and long-term skin damage.Is it true that … showering every day is bad for your skin?Read moreWhat skincare do you recommend for children – and what should they stay away from?I think it’s amazing that young people are thinking about their skin, but I do have significant concerns about the effect of social media on young people’s perceptions of themselves. I’m also concerned that the information they see is not regulated and maybe not aimed directly at teenagers – adolescents should not be using active ingredients such as vitamin C and retinol (unless prescribed by a doctor). Young skin is very delicate and should only need a gentle cleanser, light moisturiser and factor 50+ sunscreen if out in the sun.Paula’s Choicehas some good advice for managing teenage breakouts.Whattreatment/gadgetwould you blow the bank on?I’d recommendCurrentBody’s Dermalux Flex MD LED Light Therapy Device, which is the most powerful light-treatment device that you can have at home, and is three times more powerful than other home devices. It has three light sources: red light, which is anti-inflammatory and boosts collagen and hydration in the skin; near-infrared light, which works at a deeper level for healing; and blue light, which is great for acne/breakouts. It’s mainly used in clinics, but the company does sell them for home use. This device costs £1,999.What skincare advice would you give your younger self?To stay out of the sunshine and to start wearing factor 50 every day – when my clients come for a skincare consultation, including a factor 50 SPF is the first step I add to their daily routine. I’m always asked what the best product is and I always say, “It’s the one that you like to wear every day.” There are hundreds on the market so find the one that suits you.What’s the product you can’t live without?At the moment, I’m obsessed withAlumierMD MicroDerm Polish– it leaves my skin feeling so smooth, refreshed and polished.What’s the most common mistake you see?People buying expensive skincare products that don’t have any active ingredients in them. They don’t work at a cellular level, they just make the skin feel nice.What do you do that would surprise people?I have very few steps to my skincare routine. When things get busy, all I manage to do is wash my face in the shower and put my sunscreen on – life is complicated enough as it is!Explore more on these topicsThe FilterSkincareBeautyMakeupWomen's hairfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On the whole, though, the longer the feta has been aged, the punchier its finish will be. Young cheese needs only about two to three months to mature, and can vary in anything from its saltiness to its tanginess and strength. One thing is for certain, however: if the cheese is labelled “feta”, it will have been made in Greece due to a European PDO (protected designation of origin), so you can be assured that it’s the real deal and made with sheep’s milk, or a blend of sheep and goat’s milk.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

It certainly didn’t happen in real life, to real people, and it certainly couldn’t happen to me. I was entirely devoted to my career in radio and, after a particularly bad breakup, had all but sworn off love.It was November 2016 and raining. I remember, because I’d just had my hair and makeup done. I cursed the grey Sydney sky that was quickly turning my hair frizzy as I raced to the Star casino, like I did every year around this time. It was the Aria music awards, which meant I’d soon be in a room with a few thousand people sipping free booze and growing increasingly raucous as the night progressed. This night was one for debauchery, drunkenness and maybe a cheeky pash on a dark dancefloor. It certainly wasn’t where you met your future husband.The moment I knew: when he said I love you, it took me days to build up the nerve to respondRead moreThe Veronicas were on stage, performing in nothing but red body glitter, when I saw him out of the corner of my eye, apologetically squeezing past people in an effort to find his seat. He had curly hair pulled back into a man bun, glasses and a simple black suit. My stomach flipped. I leaned over, grabbed my best friend Angus’s leg and asked who this man was. I insisted he introduce me as soon as possible because I was “going to marry him”. He probably thought I was joking. I wasn’t.I found out his name was Adrian and that he worked in our Melbourne office. I’d heard people speak about him before, and had assumed he was much older. Words like “mentor” and “good bloke” had been thrown around – not words I usually equated with a man in his 30s who ran a radio station. After securing an introduction, I had to wait until the show was over to have a proper conversation. I spent the next couple of hours catching glances and trying to send sly photos of him to the group chat.Eventually a group of us headed to the top floor of the Intercontinental hotel in Sydney for the afterparty. The place was jam-packed and I found myself scanning the room to see if Adrian had arrived. Moments later he walked in and we locked eyes. I ditched my mates and before long we were holed up in a corner chatting like we’d known each other for years.View image in fullscreen‘We were holed up in a corner chatting like we’d known each other for years’ … Ash and Adrian on the night they met in 2016We nursed glasses of sparkling water while everyone around us got progressively drunker. He didn’t try to impress me. There was no ego. We spoke about our families, where we’d grown up and our travel plans. It was blindingly clear to me from the moment we started speaking that this beautiful boy would be my husband, and I would do everything I could to make him happy for ever.There is, however, a difference between knowing someone is “the one” and realising you’ve actually fallen in love. That moment came one night within the first month or so of dating. We lived in different cities and we were FaceTiming. As we were wrapping up the conversation and saying goodnight, I accidentally dropped a very casual: “All right, love you!” Realising what I’d said, I promptly hung up before he could react. I was mortified, but knew that I’d be lying if I tried to take it back. It wasn’t a slip of the tongue, because when I took a moment to think about it, it was clear to me that I really did love him. He rang back a moment later, and I answered the call to see his sweet, goofy, slightly smug face smiling back at me. I giggled, embarrassed. He laughed, and with a simple “I love you too, obviously”, turned the situation from mortifying to swoon-worthy.Three months later we spotted a beautiful vintage ruby ring while out shopping. He bought it while I was in the bathroom. Later that year, 12 months after we first laid eyes on one another, he proposed. This time we were alone at a cabin in the Blue Mountains. No pop stars prancing around in red body glitter, no raucous musicians drunk on free booze. We’ve now been married for seven years, and have a gorgeous three-year-old son called Buddy. While life hasn’t always been easy in those years, loving each other always has.Ash London is the author ofLove On the Air(Allen & Unwin, $32.99)Tell us the moment you knewShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

Developmental milestones were missed, and the difference between Tristan and others became stark. It could not be ignored, denied or explained away – our beautiful son was profoundly autistic.Tristan was offered a place at a school for children with autism, and every Wednesday morning for a year, I was invited into the school to learn how to interact, play and communicate with our boy. It helped me understand what his future might look like. I could see that he might never talk, work, drive a car or have his own family – he could be dependent on us for the rest of his life.Naturally, we would look after him for as long as we could – until, of course, we couldn’t. What would happen to our son when we were no longer here? That worry consumed us for years.The financial time bomb facing special educational needs – podcastRead moreI stumbled upon special needs planning in 2016 when Tristan was six. A chartered financial adviser at the time, I heard the phrase “disabled person’s trusts” at a networking event, and my ears pricked up. I’d not heard the phrase before.I know now that a disabled or vulnerable person’s trust is one of the two most common types of trust used to protect and support disabled people. Rather than being given or left to the vulnerable person themselves, money can be held in a trust, with others (the trustees) responsible for looking after it.The other most common type is a discretionary trust, and the type of trust that a family uses will depend on their aims and circumstances.A will and trust are the crucial foundation of any special needs plan, but documenting your wishes is an important step, tooAt that time, I didn’t know there were specialist trusts that could protect my son – who is now 15 – and, honestly, I felt ashamed that it had taken a chance meeting for me to learn about them.At the same meeting, a solicitor told a story about “a beneficiary unable to take valid receipt for an inheritance”. She was describing those who lack the mental capacity to receive their estate. If someone doesn’t have the mental capacity to receive an estate, a court-appointed deputy or attorney would have to accept it on their behalf. This threw me again – I’d not even considered whether Tristan would fall into this category and had assumed that if I named him in my will, he’d receive his inheritance, no matter what. These were terms that had not been in any financial planning manual I’d read. I wanted to know more, so I picked up copies of whatever slides, brochures and leaflets I could and left.On the journey home, I thought about our will, finances and plans for the future.I’d named my son in my will – I didn’t realise that would only cause him problems. I didn’t understand what would happen if he didn’t have the mental capacity to receive his inheritance. He’d undoubtedly be vulnerable with money in his hands and unable to work or provide for himself. I had so many questions. How could we provide for him safely? How could we protect him, and who would care for him? Would responsibility for him be left to my older son? Did we need to secure his means-tested care? What else had we missed?View image in fullscreen‘Problems caused by the wrong will, wrong trust or no will at all remain the number one area of avoidable harm that I see in my practice daily.’Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianI could see that the financial and legal plans my husband and I had put in place would cause our son nothing short of a financial nightmare. But I didn’t know how to address it.What hope would other parents have if a chartered financial adviser struggled with it?Sheer panic set in, and I made it my mission to understand. I studied technical manuals, spoke to experts in different fields, and, with a basic grasp of what I needed to do, visited three solicitors, chose one, and arranged our special needs plan for my son.Alongside the will, I formed the financial part of the plan. It was an empowering exercise. For every “wrong way” of planning for Tristan, two “right ways” made more sense.Since then, I have held groups for parents at my son’s school, where I’ve pointed out the three main challenges to watch out for. Vulnerable dependants often struggle to access their inheritance; they may become even more vulnerable in receipt of the money; and a direct inheritance can result in the loss of means-tested benefits, care or support.Often, these three challenges hit at the same time. Once this perfect storm has happened, it can be devastating and, sadly, very difficult to reverse.One mum told me she was living through one of the challenges herself. Her niece – who lacked capacity – couldn’t access the inheritance she had been locked out of, and her means-tested residential home placement was in jeopardy. The mum had tried to help but without success. The matter would have to go to court.I hear similar upsetting stories at every parent event I run.Problems caused by the wrong will, wrong trust or no will at all remain the number one area of avoidable harm that I see in my practice daily. Parents who want to pass down money to a vulnerable dependant aren’t aware they should consider specialist wills and trusts. It certainly didn’t occur to me and my husband when our son was diagnosed.View image in fullscreenRhiannon with son Tristan.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianFor any parent or carer new to special needs planning, I’d offer the following guidance:1) Doing nothing is usually not an option. Conventional (or no) financial planning doesn’t work for special needs families like ours – it often results in money landing in the hands of the most vulnerable, causing irreparable harm.2) The first step is to focus on a positive vision for your young person’s future. Can you describe what their best future would look like and document it?3) With your vision in hand, find a reputable, qualified solicitor experienced in drafting wills and trusts for the vulnerable and make inquiries. Think about what you want to achieve and never be afraid to ask questions – no caring professional minds.4) Drafting a “letter of wishes” costs nothing. While not legally binding, it records what you want to happen when you are no longer here, which can be incredibly helpful for those left behind. A will and trust are the crucial foundation of any special needs plan, but documenting your wishes is an important step, too.5) Seek support from a local parent-carer forum or charities offering courses on wills and trusts for special needs. Learning some of the technicalities beforehand can put you on the front foot in what can be an emotional journey.Planning with Love: A Guide to Wills and Trusts for Parents of Children with Special Needs by Rhiannon Gogh (£15.99)ispublished on 8 Mayand isavailable now for pre-order.Explore more on these topicsFamily financesAutismChild trust fundsChildrenDisabilityFamilyParents and parentingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But there is another option …Rutger BregmanSat 19 Apr 2025 03.00 EDTShareOf all the things wasted in our throwaway times, the greatest is wasted talent. There are millions of people around the world who could help make the world a better place, but don’t. I’m talking about the ones who have got the power to shape their own careers, though you would never know it from their utterly unsurprising résumés. About the talented folks with the world at their feet who nonetheless get stuck in mind-numbing, pointless or just plain harmful jobs.There’s an antidote to that kind of waste, and it’s calledmoral ambition. Moral ambition is the will to make the world a wildly better place. To devote your working life to the great challenges of our time, whether that’s the climate crisis or corruption, gross inequality or the next pandemic. It’s a longing to make a difference – and to build a legacy that truly matters.Moral ambition begins with a simple realisation: you’ve only got one life. The time you have left on this Earth is your most precious possession. You can’t buy yourself more time, and every hour you’ve spent is gone for ever. A full-time career consists of 80,000 hours, or 10,000 workdays, or 2,000 workweeks. How you spend that time is one of the most important moral decisions of your life.So what do you want on your résumé? Do you go for a respectable, if bland, list? Or do you set the bar higher? Morally ambitious individuals don’t move with the herd, but believe in a deeper form of freedom. It’s the freedom to push aside conventional standards of success, to make your own way along life’s path, knowing that it’s a journey you can only make once.Those looking to do some good in today’s world don’t have to look far. Still reeling from a global pandemic, we’re seeing hunger surge for the first time in years. Meanwhile, autocrats are on the rise, while the number of people forced to flee their homes has topped 100 million for the first time. And as temperatures hit one record high after another,climate scientists are stressing the needfor “the biggest and most fundamental transformation” of society ever attempted in peacetime.In short: these times call for moral ambition.Now, you might be thinking: that’s all well and good, but I’ve got a full-time job, two kids and a mortgage. I’m happy to recycle and eat some tofu now and then, but a “fundamental transformation”? No thanks.In that case, moral ambition may not be for you. I mean, once you have a labradoodle, a set of cheese knives or a robot mower, there’s generally no going back. But if that’s irritating to hear – and I imagine it might be – then by all means, prove me wrong. I have learned that there are always exceptions, and I want to show that you can be that exception. It’s never too late to step up.Let’s start with a simple model of what you can do with your talents. Whether you’ve got your whole career ahead of you or are looking to make a change, it seems to me you’ve got roughly four options:View image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian DesignCategory I jobsNot that ambitious, not that idealisticSome jobs simply don’t add much value. These are people writing reports nobody reads or managing colleagues who don’t need managing.Recent research showsabout 8% of all employees think their own job is pretty pointless. Another 17% confess to having some doubts about whether their job contributes to society.The late anthropologist David Graeber (1961–2020) had a highly technical term for such positions: bullshit jobs. What jobs are we talking about here? Well, we know which ones they’re not. In 2020, at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, lists of “essential workers” popped up everywhere: from cleaning staff to street sweepers, teachers to firefighters, bus drivers to nurses. These are the people who keep the world running; they don’t need a lecture on moral ambition.But there’s also a class of not-so-useful jobs. A class of influencers and marketeers, lobbyists and managers, consultants and corporate lawyers – all people who could go on strike and the world would be just fine. Remarkably enough, this group includes many men and women with impressive credentials and equally impressive salaries. Reminds me of that Facebook employee who said, “The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads.”For some in this not-all-that-ambitious, not-all-that-idealistic category, there’s an escape hatch: becoming financially independent. Countless self-help books lay out how to get rich with minimal effort, so you can get out as soon as possible, then kick back and relax. Loads of people in their 20s or 30s now dream of accumulatingpassive income– from shares, cryptocurrency or real estate – so they can “earn” enough to retire early.Nothing wrong with having some savings and investments, of course. But at its core, this kind of thinking always seems a little sad to me. It means you’re chasing a form of freedom where you won’t have to lift a finger. The dream is to make the transition from office serf to modern-day feudal lord – living off passive income while other people do the actual work.Category II jobsAmbitious, but not all that idealisticThe second category of wasted talent consists of people who are ambitious but not so idealistic. Or, put another way, these people want to reach the top, but use soulless indicators for success: a fancy title, a fat salary, a corner office or other perks.Take graduates from the world’s most prestigious universities. Approximately 45% of Harvard alumni go into finance or consulting. A poll from a few years back shows that in my country, the Netherlands, 40% of “high achievers” (college students with excellent grades) aspire to work for major consulting firms such as McKinsey or the Boston Consulting Group.We’re talking colossal waste of talent here. Economist Benjamin Lockwood, who studied at Amherst, the elite private college in Massachusetts, noticed many of his fellow students went into fields with no clear added value to society. In 2017, Lockwood and two colleagues published agroundbreaking studyshowing many of those former classmates nowcostsociety money. (Think banking execs who need bailing out with public money.)A corporate lawyer, for instance, does $30,000 of damage to society each year, a commercial banker more than $100,000. That’s a lot of money, but if you ask Lockwood, he stresses that theopportunity costsare much higher. That’s economic jargon for:just think how much better shape our world would be in if these bright people had done something useful with their careers.If you’re among the top in your field, you can afford to go skiing or buy a beach house. But is that really all you want out of life?Take consultants. These talented people are at best helping others be a little more productive. They don’t start new organisations, don’t come up with new innovations and generally don’t concern themselves with the most pressing challenges facing us today.If you’re among the top in your field, you can afford to go skiing regularly or buy that beach house you always dreamed of. But is that really all you want out of life? Surely there’s more to it. Many young consultants,according to the Financial Timesa few years back, “feel they add little value to the world and lack a sense of personal growth, community and purpose”.Things aren’t much different for many entrepreneurs. I was scrolling through lists of successful startups recently and spotted a couple of inspired initiatives – a company working on cultivated meat, an enterprise building a solar-powered car and an organisation developing a nasal spray that protects against viruses. Very promising stuff.But more often than not, we’re offered solutions for problems we didn’t know we had. Take the category “best young entrepreneurs”, where I came across the firm offering an electric toothbrush-head subscription. Or yet another food delivery app, a personalised vitamin service, or that mattress startup that advertised on every podcast in my feed a while back.Now, I don’t have anything against mattresses, and getting a new head for my toothbrush in the mail every other month sounds handy, honestly. But you’ve got to wonder what the founders of companies like these could have achieved if they’d taken on a challenge like, I don’t know, the 5.4 million infants and children worldwide who die each year from diseases we can easily – easily! – prevent.What if they’d put their talent towards something that really mattered?Category III jobsIdealistic, but not all that ambitiousAnd then there’s a third category, made up of people who are idealistic, but not that ambitious. It’s a combination often seen in gen Z – people born since 1996. Many young people are far more idealistic than their parents and are focused on a number of the big challenges of our day, whether that’s the climate crisis or racism, sexual harassment or inequality.But something seems to be missing. You see it in young people’s take on their careers: with no interest in joining the capitalist rat race, many want work they’re passionate about – and preferably part-time. Sometimes it seems “ambition” has become a dirty word, incompatible with an idealistic lifestyle. Many people are more preoccupied with the kind of work they do than with the impact that work has. As long as it feels good. “Small is beautiful,” you’ll hear. Or “think global, act local” – as if achieving little is somehow a virtue.In some circles, you’d think the highest good is not to have any impact at all. A good life is defined by what youdon’tdo. Don’t fly. Don’t eat meat. Don’t have kids. And don’t even think about using a plastic straw. Reduce! Reduce! Reduce! The aim is to have the smallest footprint possible, with your little veg garden and your tiny house. Best-case scenario? Your impact on the planet is so negligible, you could just as well not have existed.View image in fullscreenRutger Bregman: ‘Going viral isn’t the same as winning a majority.’Photograph: Natalie Keyssar/The GuardianDon’t get me wrong – it’s a fine idea to align even your smallest deeds with your biggest values. (And not eating meat from factory farms seems to me a moral minimum.) But surely a good life consists of more than what youdon’tdo? One would hope that on your deathbed, you can chalk up your life’s work to more than simply all the harm you didn’t cause?Seen this way, even the most moralistic movement shows a serious lack of ambition. I’m talking about those called “woke”. Often accused of going too far, woke activists in many cases don’t go far enough. Take the preoccupation with the words we use to describe the world. Yes, words matter, and to some extent even shape our reality. But in the end, what youdomatters far more.If we look at the concrete successes of these kinds of activists, the results seem meagre. True, you can reach millions these days in no time with an online rant against sexism, racism or capitalism.Kill the patriarchy! Defund the police! Tax the rich!But what happens next? Having lots of followers on Instagram isn’t the same as building an effective organisation. Going viral isn’t the same as winning a majority in the legislature.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

How do you lobby effectively? Where’s the money coming from? Who plays a key role in that commission at local, state or national level? How can you find out what buttons to push, and when? And who has the knowhow to tweak legislation in clever ways?The trouble with idealists who lack ambition is they tend to prize awareness more than action. But here’s the thing: awareness alone won’t help a soul. It’s at best a starting point, while for many activists, it seems to have become the end goal.Category IV jobsIdealistic and ambitiousIs there another way? Say you take the ambition of a high-flyer and add a generous dose of idealism. What do you get?Let me introduce one of my personal heroes, the British author and activist Thomas Clarkson. In 1785, as a 24-year-old university student, Clarkson decided to enter an essay contest in Latin at the University of Cambridge. To take part, he had to answer a short question:Anne liceat invitos in servitutem dare?That is:Is itOK to force others into slavery?At the time, winning a Latin essay contest wastheway to make a name for yourself at university. “I had no motive but that which other young men in the university had on such occasions,” Clarkson would later recall, “namely the wish of being distinguished, or obtaining literary honour.”There was just one small problem: Clarkson didn’t know a thing about slavery. Students had two months to put their thoughts to paper, and while most only started to feel the pressure once the deadline was imminent, Clarkson was different. He got straight to work.The earnest student thought he would enjoy the research process. But the facts hit hard. “In the daytime I was uneasy. In the night I had little rest. I sometimes never closed my eyelids for grief.”A few weeks of hard work later, his essay was finished. In powerful prose, Clarkson concluded that slavery was “contrary to reason, justice, nature, the principles of law and government … and the revealed voice of God”. And, you guessed it: he won first place. Clarkson was invited to present his winning essay in the majestic Senate House at the University of Cambridge. There he stood, a towering young man with fiery hair and bright eyes. All signs indicated Thomas Clarkson had a glorious career ahead of him.But on the way back to London, he couldn’t get the subject of his essay out of his head. He got down from his horse and walked, distracted. He tried to convince himself he’d made some mistake, that the grisly facts couldn’t be right. But the longer he thought about it, the deeper the truth sunk in.One thing’s for sure. If you want to lead a morally ambitious life, there’s no time like the presentWhen the little village of Wade’s Mill came into view, he stopped and sat down, glum, at the side of the road. “Here a thought came into my mind,” he would later write, “that if the contents of the essay were true, then it was time some person should see these calamities to their end.” If the end of the global slave trade started anywhere, it started here, at the side of the road outside Wade’s Mill.Of course, there had been others who protested against the most heinous forms of slavery. And certainly, history is filled with acts of resistance by enslaved people, who time and again worked to throw off their chains. But the fact of the matter is that for centuries, victims of the system weren’t able to overthrow that system. The very notion ofabolitionism, the idea that the whole institution of slavery could be abolished once and for all, long seemed unthinkable.One evening, at a dinner with a few other abolitionists, Clarkson made a decision. The young man knew someone had to dedicate their life to the fight against slavery, and so he stood up and announced to everyone there, “I’m ready to devote myself to the cause.”That may sound a little melodramatic. And if you read Clarkson’s memoirs today, you can’t help but think,Easy there, Clarkson, you seem mighty impressed with yourself. But make no mistake, idealism often comes with a shot of vanity. With many a world-saver, it’s tough to say where the idealism ends and the vanity begins. But real-world deeds are more important than intentions, and when it came down to it, the ambitious college student kept his word. For the rest of his life, for 61 more years, he continued to fight for his ideals.View image in fullscreenThomas Clarkson addressing the 1840 Anti-Slavery Society convention in London.Photograph: Pictures from History/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesIn 1787, Clarkson became one of the 12 founders of the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade. Ten of the otherswere entrepreneurs. Go through their archives today and you’ll find to-do lists, action plans. While the French abolitionist movement was led by writers and intellectuals (and didn’t get much done), the British movement was run by merchants and businessmen.After a years-long campaign, the UK officially banned the slave trade in 1807 – at a time of peak profits, no less. The British then forced other countries out. The Royal Navy launched the “blockade of Africa”, where they captured 2,000 slaving vessels and freed those aboard.“In the end,” two experts estimate, “direct British efforts accounted for eliminating 80% of the slave trade.” From 1807 to 1867, the British put an astronomical amount of money into enforcing the ban: nearly 2% of the national income, or four times the UK’s current foreign aid budget. The researchers speak of the “most costly international moral action in modern history”.The historian Christopher Leslie Brown – one of the foremost experts on British abolitionism – was once asked who the most consequential individual was in the British anti-slavery movement. Brown answered that, at the start of his career, he was determined not to give too much attention to individual heroes. He wanted to focus on the structural causes of abolitionism. But the more time he spent with the archives, the more he realised some individuals did have outsized influence – Thomas Clarkson in particular. “As far as the movement goes,” Brown said, “Clarkson is essential to what ends up emerging.” Clarkson grew to be one of the greatest reformers of his time. What the apostle Paul was to Christianity, and Martin Luther to the Reformation, Clarkson was to abolitionism. A “moral steam engine”, a contemporary called him, a “giant with one idea”.I’ve spent years researching the Clarksons of our time: activists and entrepreneurs, doctors and lawyers, engineers and innovators, all bursting with moral ambition. What they have in common is a refusal to see their own deeds as drops in the ocean. They believe they can make a difference and are prepared to take risks to get there. They don’t just think, “Someoneshould do something about that” but take action themselves.What many of these people also share is a certain degree of privilege. Not everyone can devote their life to the world’s biggest problems. Clarkson could never have been a full-time abolitionist without the inheritance his father left him. Still, people suffering from poverty and illness, racism and sexism can move mountains, too. Helen Keller (1880–1968) was blind and deaf, and became a renowned advocate for people with disabilities. Malcolm X (1925–1965) grew up in deep poverty and became an iconic leader in the struggle for civil rights.‘A bigger paycheck? I’d rather watch the sunset!’: is this the end of ambition?Read moreTrue, people with moral ambition often pay a price for their ideals. Malcolm X paid with his life. And even for those blessed with long lives, moral ambition can take its toll. Clarkson travelled 35,000 miles in seven years – on horseback, and often at night – to bring his pamphlets and petitions to the people. At 33, he suffered a nervous breakdown, or what we’d now call burnout. Year in, year out, he’d filled his brain with the horrors of slavery, in facts and figures and brutal images. “I am often seized with giddiness and cramps,” Clarkson wrote in his journal. “I feel an unpleasant ringing in my ears, my hands tremble. Cold sweats come upon me.”So no, Clarkson wasn’t exactly mindful, and should have done his breathing exercises. It’s in nobody’s interest for the folks making the world a better place to collapse at 33 and have to be carried off mid-fight. But at least he didn’t get burned out from scrolling through never-ending spreadsheets or sitting through yet another PowerPoint. “I was therefore obliged, though very reluctantly,” he wrote in his memoirs, “to be borne out of the field where I had placed the great honour and glory of my life.”So ask yourself the question: what’s the “great honour and glory” of your life? What do you hope one day to look back on? “A person of honour cares first of all not about being respected,” writes the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah, “but about being worthy of respect.” Your honour is not the same as your reputation. It’s not aboutlookinggood; it’s aboutdoinggood.One thing’s for sure. If you want to lead a morally ambitious life, there’s no time like the present. Fear of change is often the first sign of ageing, and before you know it, you’re in golden handcuffs: stuck in a ho-hum job with no time to spare and all your money earmarked for things like that toothbrush-head subscription.But make the leap and the possibilities are endless. Because so many others waste their talents, people with moral ambition can make a world of difference.This is an edited extract from Moral Ambition by Rutger Bregman, published by Bloomsbury on 24 April at £20.

The lake in question is the magical and wild Mergozzo, tiny, utterly charming and yet still rarely visited by tourists.The house was built in 1963. Its equally fascinating current owner, Hilary Belle Walker, has American roots – San Francisco is her hometown, but she moved to Italy at the age of 23.The house was acoup de foudrefrom afar, especially since it had preserved all the charm of its era. In 2018, Hilary, already in love with the area, registered on a real-estate website, almost as a game. When she received an email notifying her of the house’s availability, owning it became an obsession. After sending friends to view it, she bought it remotely, without visiting it in person.View image in fullscreenThe house has incredible views over Italy’s Mergozzo lake.Photograph: Barbetta and Agostinetti/Living InsideHilary has a keen eye for detail. An entrepreneur in the vintage fashion sector, she’s the founder ofBivio Milano, a second-hand boutique chain that has become an institution in the city. She managed to maintain the home’s original spirit while adding pieces sourced from markets and warehouses. The two vintage Missoni rugs dominating the living room come from different estates yet harmonise perfectly with the recurring colour palette of green, plum, aubergine and pink – hues that are strikingly contemporary. The burgundy ceiling was deliberately chosen to enhance the ambience. The original green floors remain beautifully preserved. The addition of 1960s wallpaper by a Swedish illustrator amplifies the vintage feel of the space.A large glass door opens on to a balcony with its original tiles, offering an uninterrupted view of the lake. A short flight of stairs leads from the ground floor to the sleeping area, where the master bedroom and her daughter’s rooms are located. The latter is furnished with twin beds for visiting friends.View image in fullscreenThe home’s original green floors remain beautifully preserved, while 1960s wallpaper amplifies the vintage feel of the space.Photograph: Barbetta and Agostinetti/Living InsideThe bathroom is the only space that underwent a more radical change, though it remains true to the era. Hilary sourced never-used avocado-green fixtures from a nearby warehouse – ideal for recreating the authentic 1960s atmosphere. Outside, a massive stone table sits beneath an old oak tree. Transporting it was a logistical challenge due to its weight, but it now serves as a perfect relaxation and dining spot for friends and family.Time flows differently here, compared to the city. Hilary and her daughter live in an apartment in Milan, but escape to the lake whenever school and work allow. A record player replaces Spotify, a DVD player takes the place of Netflix and groceries are bought from the local shop as needed, rather than stockpiled from the supermarket. There’s a different way of life here: this Italian region’s inhabitants often feel a closer connection to Lombard and Swiss traditions. A welcoming space with unique traditions and habits.View image in fullscreenThe home’s original green floors remain beautifully preserved, while 1960s wallpaper amplifies the vintage feel of the spacePhotograph: Barbetta and Agostinetti/Living InsideIn front of the house, a small pathway off the large sloping lawn leads to the road below. Just across the road lies another hidden gem, invisible to passersby: a small private beach that has retained all of the lake’s wild and natural beauty. A poetic place to swim undisturbed and read a book.In the end, Hilary has crafted a small, magical universe for herself and her daughter, between the mountain range known as the “Sleeping Dragon,” where trains occasionally pass, and a stunning body of water that never fails to deliver on its promise of unspoiled beauty.For more details, go tobiviomilano.itExplore more on these topicsInteriorsThe ObserverHomesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She’s just been inducted into the International Women’s Boxing Hall of FamePaul DaleySat 19 Apr 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Apr 2025 21.11 EDTShareThe soft early evening spring light floods the room behind the world champion you’ve probably never heard of. In front of a big poster of a shirtless Bruce Lee adorning her wall, Diana Prazak smiles and laughs often as she talks about her most unlikely career and her road to the top.The expatriate from Melbourne is arguably the most successful professional boxer that Australia has produced – she attained the ranking of best active professional boxerpound-for-poundin 2014 – but celebration of her world champion status remains disappointingly muted in her home country.“It’s kind of broken my heart really because growing up we were always told what a sports-mad country Australia is and how proud we were of our athletes. And here I had done something no other Australian had ever done and there was just no [media] coverage back home,’’ she says in a call from the home she shares with her American wife, Naomi, in Riverside County on the border of Los Angeles County in California.“It is demoralising. My country hasn’t really acknowledged anything we’ve done.”She says this without apparent bitterness or anger. Women’s professional boxing has never had the profile or prize money of the men’s sport. Now, two years retired, she can see other up-and-coming women starting to build a profile that was never possible for her.View image in fullscreenDiana Prazak is two years retired.Photograph: Kayla James/The GuardianEarlier this month when Prazak, 45, was inducted into the International Women’s BoxingHall of Famein Las Vegas as a legend of her sport, it was a fitting if overdue celebration of an extraordinary career that almost didn’t happen.As a child in Hoppers Crossing, deep in Melbourne’s western suburbs, Prazak was always good at sport. She was a small-framed cross-country runner and tennis player. But she also experienced abuse – something she did not begin to psychologically deal with until well into adulthood.“My abuse happened when I was a child and [is] something I only dealt with later in life as I was able to come to terms with it.“My fitness diminished because I became a workaholic [in information technology] and had no goals. My coping mechanism was food and alcohol.“Being a fighter was a way for me to feel like I was in control again as well as an outlet. I felt like I wasn’t supported and didn’t want my life defined by what was in my past.View image in fullscreen‘I had done something no other Australian had ever done and there was just no [media] coverage back home’: Diana Prazak.Photograph: Kayla James/The Guardian“I was really quite the drinker. I was a chain-smoker and I was really quite overweight.”She explains how she got into the sport that would captivate her.“My ex was a muso and we were at a gig together one night, and I was just on the piss is the honest truth … and then a mate came along and said there was a new [boxing] gym [nearby] just opened up and if I wanted to come and check it out with them I could and … that’s how it started,” she says.“I asked the owner of the gym about sparring and he said, ‘What’s the bloody point – you’re too old, you’re too fat and you’re also a girl – you’ll never amount to anything in this sport.’ And they were some motivating words for me. But I never thought I was going to actually be any good at boxing.’’But she was wrong. She was very good. She had natural talent. But she also quickly became addicted to a desire to get better and better while sparring.“It was a way, initially, for me to get into better shape. But then it became an absolute compulsion for me to get better and better, to train harder every day. I really wanted to be the best. Definitely. And to win.”View image in fullscreenDiana Prazak is arguably the most successful professional boxer Australia has produced.Photograph: Kayla James/The GuardianBut Prazak was already nearly 27 – a definite disadvantage given many of her contemporaries had been in the ring since their mid-teens and fighting competitively for years. After just six months of training Prazak had her first amateur fight. She won it – and her next five amateur bouts.She decided to turn professional. To stand any chance of becoming one of the world’s best she says she felt she had no choice but to move to the United States. So in 2012 she moved from Melbourne to Los Angeles.She had no promoter and no sponsor.“I just had to do it off my own bat,” she says.But she engaged as her trainer the celebrated world champion Dutch boxer, kickboxer and actorLucia Rijker, dubbed by the sport’s media as “the most dangerous woman in the world”. She rented a room in a motel on Sunset Boulevard while they prepared for a shot at the World Boxing Council women’s super featherweight title in Sweden.LA was a culture shock. It was often lonely and sometimes frightening because of random street crime – including the threat of mugging.“I was there [at the motel] for about four weeks,” she says. “I would shit myself every night. It was nothing like what I thought it was going to be like. I was too scared to walk down the street after dark. It was crazy. But I had to run, like all boxers do – we run – to train. So I would do my work during the day and then I would run at night. It was so scary. But I was fast because I just had to be.View image in fullscreen‘I definitely wasn’t flying business class. It was cattle class the whole way’: boxer Diana Prazak.Photograph: Kayla James/The Guardian“Every night there was a stabbing or a shooting and you heard sirens 24/7. It was just a massive culture shock.”But her sights were on Sweden where, in 2013, she won the super featherweight world title, knocking out the champion Frida Wallberg in the eighth round. She received littlepublicity for her efforts back homeeven after successfullydefending the title.While top professional male boxers stand to make millions of dollars from prize purses and sponsorship, the financial reward for Prazak was as scant as the publicity. Pre-fight training expenses were often up to US$20,000.“It’s a gigantic inequity. We would be in the red after almost every fight. I’ve been retired for two years now and I think the most I ever made was 17 grand for a fight. It was very rare that I found myself with money in my pocket after a fight … I definitely wasn’t flying business class. It was cattle class the whole way.”When she eventually retired, Prazak had lost just four of her 18 professional fights, eight of which she won by knockout.She says that while boxing – and her enormous drive to win – has involved enormous personal sacrifice and, at times, physical pain, it also gave her life a meaning she could not have imagined before she entered the ring.“Boxing took so much away from me but it also gave me so much. It gave me balance in my life … it allowed me travel the world, it made me a champion and it gave me a goal I thought I’d never achieve. And I never would have met my wife if I didn’t come to America. It gave me so much more than it ever took away from me.”View image in fullscreenDiana Prazak’s induction into the International Women’s Boxing Hall of Fame was an overdue celebration of an extraordinary career.Photograph: Kayla James/The GuardianPrazak says she feels a deep affinity with Australia even though she has lived in the US for the past 13 years during which she has witnessed enormous political and cultural change.“When I arrived [Barack] Obama was president and he was seeking re-election,” she says. “Back then the haters weren’t speaking up so you didn’t hear the hate here so much. But as we all know that has changed. I’m in a same-sex relationship and I’m a dual citizen over here. But I’ll never be an American and they know that and I feel that.”Having conquered the world of women’s professional boxing, Prazak has her eyes on returning home to Melbourne.“My end goal is definitely to come home to Australia and to stay at home and to visit the States so that my wife can see her family as opposed to me visiting Melbourne so I can see mine.’’A homecoming for a boxing world champion who only ever entered the ring by chance in the first place.Explore more on these topicsBoxingAustralia sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Harvard must stand up, speak out, and lead a public defense of our freedom to speak and study freely.”The piece resonated widely within the Harvard community, Enos said, even reportedly reaching Harvard’s board of overseers (one of the school’s two governing bodies).Enos decided to write to several members of the board of overseers, sharing arguments from his recent op-eds. He had heard that some board members were sympathetic to their view.In mid-March, universities watchedColumbia yield to a series of sweeping demandsmade by the Trump administration in an effort to restore the halted funding. (The funding remains withheld, and reports now suggest that apossible consent decree is on the table.)Enos and others feared that when the time came, Harvard might follow suit. At that point, Enos said, Harvard’s leadership had shown “no indication” that they were willing to put up a public fight in defense of Harvard or public education more generally.In the weeks prior, the universityhad appeared to be taking pre-emptive steps to get aheadof the administration’s potential crackdown and funding cuts. They announced auniversity-wide hiring freeze, and made several decisions that critics viewed asaligning with the administration’s priorities.The universityadopted a controversial definitionof antisemitism in a legal settlement over complaints brought by Jewish students,ousted two leadersof its Center for Middle Eastern Studies, suspendeda public health partnership with Birzeit Universityin the West Bank and a “religion, conflict and peace initiative” at the Harvard Divinity School amid accusations that it focused “entirely on the Palestinians”, and banned the Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee from hosting events on campus.These actions causedconcern for some who worriedthat Harvard was compromising academic freedom to appease the government.“Someone might reasonably think that these changes were in order to accommodate, to demonstrate to the federal government, look, we’re closing down programs that have been accused of imbalanced coverage,” said Kirsten Weld, a professor of history at Harvard, who heads Harvard’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP).On 24 March, Enos and Levitsky, with help from several others, circulated aletteramong faculty, urging Harvard’s two governing boards to publicly condemn the attacks on universities, legally contest and resist unlawful demands, and mount a coordinated opposition.More than800 faculty members signed, though some non-US citizens refrained due to fear, Enos said.The letter was sent to governing board members before their next scheduled meeting, which was to be on 5 and 6 April.Separately, in another letter,more than 1,000 Harvard alumni urgedHarvard’s president, Alan Garber, to defend academic freedom and free speech, and to take a stronger stand.“We cannot appease theTrump administration– it always asks for more,” the letter warned.James Stodder, who drafted and circulated that letter, said that he and a group of other alumni were looking for ways they could make their voices heard.Another alumniletterwith more than 1,200 signatures called for courage over capitulation.In late March, Harvard’s chapter of the AUP along with the national chapter and other groups,sued the Trump administration, alleging it had violated members’ first amendment rights by targeting pro-Palestinian speech by noncitizens.Around this time, theCrimson was reportingthat Garber had been privately discussing the administration’s pressure campaign with other university leaders.Then, on 31 March, the Trump administration putHarvard directly in its crosshairs, announcing a review of Harvard’s$9bn in federal funding, citing alleged failures to address antisemitism on campus.Garber’sresponsewas seen bysomeas conceding to the administration’s narrative and suggestions.On 3 April, Trump officialssent Harvard a letter, stating that its federal funding would be conditional on changes such as eliminating diversity and inclusion programs, reviewing its programs “to address bias”, cooperating with law enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security, installing leaders to implement the president’s demands, and more.“We said to ourselves, OK, we’re now in the same position as Columbia,” Weld said. “This is kind of the first shot across the bow.”That same day, Enos and Levitsky published a third op-ed, “Appeasing Trump Damages Harvard and America”, urging the university to resist and take a stand.Enos said he heard from alumni who had begun threatening to withhold donations to the school if Harvard didn’t stand up against Trump.After receiving initial demands from the administration, theWall Street Journalreported that Harvard leaders were in contact with the administration in pursuit of an agreement. Federal officials reportedly believed that Harvard would eventually concede, as Columbia had. Harvard said that the demands were too vague and requested more details.I would find it shocking if they ignored or at least didn’t consider that kind of outpouring of faculty supportRyan Enos, Harvard professorHarvard’s governing boards met as planned in early April. While no details from those meetings were released, Enos believes their faculty letter was likely discussed, noting that last year he was told that the governing bodies had found a similar letter he organized in support of former Harvard president Claudine Gay to be “very persuasive”.“I would find it shocking if they ignored or at least didn’t consider that kind of outpouring of faculty support,” Enos said.Following the weekend meeting, the Cambridge city councilpassed a unanimous resolutionurging Harvard to reject Trump’s demands, and to “use all measures possible, including the University’s endowment funds, if necessary, to safeguard academic independence, the rule of law, and democracy”.Councilmember Burhan Azeem, who co-sponsored the resolution, said he wanted Harvard to know that they had the support of the city behind them if they chose to stand up to the administration.Azeem said it’s rare for the city council to get involved in internal Harvard affairs, but the stakes were high.“We were trying to convey to Harvard that the city is not the most powerful institution, but we are an institution, we have lawyers and we are willing to take action and we are willing to stand by them,” Azeem said.By this point, despite the Trump administration’s 3 April letter demanding “immediate cooperation”, Harvard had not yet publicly responded.On 11 April, Harvard’s AAUP chapterfiled a second lawsuit against the administration, this time challenging the federal review of the university’s federal funding.The next day, hundreds of Harvard affiliates and Cambridge residents rallied in near-freezing temperatures at Cambridge Common, demanding once more that the university resist the federal pressure and also protect its international students and faculty.Unbeknownst to the protesters, behind closed doors that weekend, Harvard leaders were parsing through a new five-page letter from the Trump administration that had been delivered late on Friday.Theletterincluded a list of sweeping demands – the shuttering of all diversity, equity and inclusion programs and initiatives, restrictions on the acceptance of international students who are “hostile to the American values and institutions”, and federal oversight of admissions, hiring and the ideology of students and staff and more.Harvard officials were stunned by the demands in the letter,the Wall Street Journalreported, viewing them as more extreme than those sent to other schools. A Sunday board meeting ended in unanimous agreement on how to respond.Then, on Monday, 14 April,Harvard released its statementpublicly rejecting the demands, and released theadministration’s Friday letter.“Although some of the demands outlined by the government are aimed at combating antisemitism”, the “majority represent direct governmental regulation of the ‘intellectual conditions’ at Harvard”, Harvard’s president wrote.“The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights. No government – regardless of which party is in power – should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.”It was then Harvardbecame the first major US universityto openly defy the administration’s demands.Garber’s office did not respond to a request for comment on how the decision came together. But, Enos believes that the pressure from faculty, alumni, students and others mattered.“I think we did manage to put a tremendous amount of pressure on Harvard to do the right thing,” Enos said. “It came from all circles.”Weld said she was “very glad” when she read the announcement, adding that the demands from the Trump administration were “such an egregious overreach”. Accepting them, she said, would have been “disastrous”.Harvard’s announcement drew support fromDemocrats, as well as Harvard faculty and alumni, andleaders of other universities.View image in fullscreenPeople protest at Harvard on 12 April 2025.Photograph: Nicholas Pfosi/ReutersThe Crimsonreported a surge in donations to Harvard after the announcement, with the school receiving an average of 88 online donations per hour. Between Monday, when the announcement was made, and 9am Wednesday, nearly 4,000 gifts totaling $1.14m had been made, according to a giving update from Harvard alumni affairs and development obtained by the Crimson.But the battle has only just begun. The fight this week has already escalated.Following Harvard’s announcement, federal officialsfroze more than $2bn in grantsto the university. Trump also has threatened to strip Harvard of its tax-exempt status and its ability to enroll international students.On Thursday, the Trump administration accused Harvard – in yet another letter to Garber – of failing to report large foreign donations to the federal government, as is required by law. They demanded that Harvard provide names of foreign donors, including records of communication with all of them from the beginning of 2020, and records pertaining to foreigners who spent time at Harvard; that latter group includes students Harvard expelled or those who had their credentials canceled, going back to 2016.A Harvard spokesperson toldthe New York Timeson Friday: “Harvard has filed Section 117 reports for decades as part of its ongoing compliance with the law.”Layoffs havealready been reported at the Harvard School of Public Health, with warnings at HarvardMedical School, too.Though Harvard’s endowment is sure to offer some financial cushion, theNew York Timesreports that about 80% of it is limited to specific purposes.“It’s going to get more painful before it gets better,” Enos said.Weld said that the AAUP will continue to proceed with their lawsuits against the administration and that concerns remain regarding Harvard’s decisions earlier this year to “shut down spaces of independent critical inquiry related to Palestine on our campus”.Still, she said it was “vitally important” for the whole higher education sector that Harvard was fighting back.“If Harvard had not stood up and rejected the Trump administration’s demands, it would have sent generational chill through higher education in this country,” she said.“If Harvard, the richest university in human history, cannot stand up and fight back to unquestionably illegal demands, then what other institution is going to feel that it’s safe for them to do so?”Explore more on these topicsHarvard UniversityTrump administrationUS universitiesUS educationUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She’s healing with a family in PhiladelphiaTasneem Sharif Abbas, 16, flew with her sister to the US, where doctors awaited and volunteers cheered their arrivalMelissa HellmannSat 19 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Apr 2025 07.02 EDTShareDozens of people across the world were in non-stop communication for several months to arrange the arrival of Tasneem Sharif Abbas to the US. Abbas’s entire life changed when a bomb dropped on her family’s home in Gaza on 31 October 2023. A piece of metal severed her arm and she blacked out as rubble fell on her. Soon after, her arm was amputated at a local Gaza hospital. “This is not a movie or a fictional story. This is the reality I have lived,” Abbas said in a statement. “This is just a glimpse of the dark days that have turned my life into a nightmare.”Last year, the 16-year-old and an accompanying guardian, her adult sister Ashjan who is not injured, evacuated to Egypt, where they spent several months aboard a medical ship. The journey to fit Abbas with a prosthetic arm began with a 24-hour-flight from Cairo to New York, where volunteers met them in the airport during a several-hour layover. “The only time there was uncertainty was in the visa process,” said Raghed Ahmed, vice-president of thePhiladelphiachapter of the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund (PCRF), a non-profit that has provided medical care to Middle Eastern kids since the 1990s. The group also facilitated the sisters’ travel. “We weren’t sure if it would take two weeks or six months, but her visa was approved in a couple of weeks,” Ahmed said.So when Abbas entered the arrivals section at the Philadelphia international airport last December, the mood was ebullient. Some 100 community members cheered and waved Palestinian flags, while others held handmade signs that read “Welcome to Philadelphia” in English and Arabic. “Free Palestine!” they shouted in unison. Farha Ghannam, an anthropology professor at Swarthmore College and Abbas’s host mother, embraced the 16-year-old and handed her a bouquet of flowers as they met for the first time.View image in fullscreenPhiladelphia community members greet Tasneem Abbas at the Philadelphia international airport on 15 December 2024.Photograph: Courtesy of Palestine Children’s Relief Fund“When they saw that there was a really big presence from the community at the airport, they really appreciated that. And [Abbas] said it made them forget the tiredness of travel,” said Johara Shamaa, a volunteer coordinator for PCRF’s Philadelphia chapter. Abbas, who declined to be interviewed due to stress, is the only Palestinian child being hosted and medically treated in Philadelphia at the sponsorship of PCRF. Aside from Philadelphia, PCRF has brought more than 20 children to Chicago, Illinois; Washington DC; Portland, Oregon; Houston, Texas; Greenville, South Carolina; St Louis, Missouri; Lexington, Kentucky; Boston, Massachusetts; and Sacramento and Los Angeles, California, to seek medical treatment since October 2023.Everywhere the children are sent, a community of people rally behind them to improve their lives. All the while, they perform a delicate dance of navigating an ever-changing evacuation system in the absence of a permanent ceasefire. In Philadelphia, 50 volunteers pitch in by driving Abbas to doctors’ appointments, tutoring her in English, and hosting dinners at their homes during the sisters’ six-month stay. The cost of Abbas’s prosthetic limb and the medical treatment to repair her residual appendage, which was improperly amputated due to the lack of medical resources in Gaza, are being covered by the hospital Shriners Children’s Philadelphia.Though Abbas’s is a story of triumph, thousands of children from Gaza have inadequate or no access to medical treatment. And with Abbas and her sister’s visa renewal coming up in May, their futures are uncertain.“You have to constantly be amendable, because every single day something is always changing,” said Tareq Hailat, head of PCRF’s treatment abroad program, which works with government entities and hospitals to facilitate free medical care. “There’s always some kind of difficulty occurring: abandonment of ceasefires, the targeting of humanitarian workers, a new border or corridor coming up, which puts a hold on operations.”While the volunteers are helping shape Abbas’s life, her host family said that the girls’ presence has also helped them feel empowered as they watch from afar Israel’s war on Gaza, where more than62,000 Palestinianshave been killed since 7 October 2023.When PCRF approached them in the late fall of 2024, Ghannam, a Palestinian American, and her husband, Hans Lofgren, a Swedish American who is fluent in Arabic, were eager to host Abbas and her sister at their home in Swarthmore, a quiet suburb 20 miles (32km) south-west of Philadelphia. Being host parents gave them a concrete way to help Palestinians after seeing “unimaginable suffering” while watching the news, Lofgren said: “When you get that kind of a request, you cannot in good conscience say no. It’s absolutely a necessity to say yes. You do not know exactly what this would involve, and what would happen, it’s a bit of an unknown. But to jump into this was absolutely necessary.”‘These communities are not just Arabs’The complicated process of sending a child to the US from Gaza involves clearances from several governments and the financial backing of non-governmental organizations and hospital systems. It begins when a hospital in the Middle East contacts PCRF because they are unable to address a child’s medical needs. PCRF then lines up a hospital abroad that will treat the child for free, and seeks approval to pull the child out of Gaza from the Israeli ministry of defense’s coordinator of government activities in the territories, and the Egyptian government. They coordinate with the United Nation’s WorldHealthOrganization to transport the child through Gaza’s Rafah border crossing to a buffer zone in al-Arish, Egypt, and then their visas are secured at embassies in Egypt.PCRF then creates a shortlist of families from a large database of volunteers whose culture and language typically align with those of the child, said Hailat from PCRF. Then a member of Hailat’s team and the local chapter interview the families and visit their homes before making the final selection. PCRF pays for the children’s travel and any clothes or supplies they will need during their six-month stay abroad.View image in fullscreenFrom left, host parents Hans Lofgren and Farha Ghannam meet with Tasneem Sharif Abbas and her sister Ashjan Abbas, at the Philadelphia international airport on 15 December 2024.Photograph: Courtesy of Palestine Children’s Relief FundOutside the US, they’ve sent more than 250 children to Egypt, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Norway, Lebanon and Jordan, and they hope to expand their efforts to the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada. But Hailat said that the amount of children they’ve helped is only a drop in the bucket.When Gaza’s Rafah border crossing to Egypt closed in May 2024 and children were instead transported through the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing, the number of evacuated children dropped from more than 280 children a month to 20. Since the Rafah border crossing was reopened in February, Hailat said, at least 600 people a month have been evacuated from Gaza. But he fears that the amount of evacuees may severely dwindle again following Israel’snew security corridorthat blocks Rafah from the rest of Gaza.“The biggest problem is that we as an organization are caught in the middle,” Hailat said. “We don’t want to be a part of the proposed displacement of these children, but we don’t want them to die. The only solution is a complete ceasefire that allows us to bring medical treatment inside Gaza.”Despite the frustration in the international process that hinders more children from evacuating, he said his faith resides in the compassionate communities throughout the US that have opened their arms to the children in need of medical treatment. “One of the most beautiful things about these communities is that they are not just Arabs, they are not just Muslims, they are not just Palestinians. They are Americans. They are of all races, of all religions, of all sexes,” Hailat said. “No matter where you stand on the political aisle, once they see these children in real life, people realize that this is a humanitarian issue.”As a Palestinian American, Ghannam said, she was initially concerned that she might be overwhelmed by the sisters’ trauma. But over the past few months, she and Lofgren say, the sisters have brought a brightness to their home. “I think I’m able to support them, but I think they are also able to support me,” Ghannam said. “Just seeing sometimes their spirits and their resilience has actually been very, very important to me. They also have been helping me deal with what’s happening.”The couple only had about a week to prepare for the sisters’ arrival after completing a vetting process with PCRF. As a semi-retired economist, Lofgren was in charge of moving the furniture into the 60-somethings’ spare storage room and securing two mattresses for the sisters to sleep on. Neighbors and friends gifted the sisters gloves and gift cards to a beauty supply chain. Philadelphia’s PCRF chapter created a group chat on WhatsApp to collect winter clothes, hygiene items, books and phone chargers, and community members stepped up to host dinners for the sisters at their homes.View image in fullscreenTasneem Abbas, 16, arrives from Gaza on 15 December 2024. Tasneem is receiving medical treatment at Shriners Children’s Philadelphia on a six-month visa.Photograph: Courtesy of Palestine Children’s Relief FundVolunteers also drive Abbas to her appointments at Shriners hospital, where she’s undergoing occupational therapy and being fitted for her prosthesis. Her medical team is determining whether they need to make adjustments to the arm replacement. “It’s a lot more complicated because of the dire need of medical supplies in Gaza, especially with the ongoing genocide and the lack of aid and completely destroyed healthcare systems. The amputation wasn’t done as it should have been,” said Shamaa, of PCRF. As part of her sessions, Abbas is training her left arm to write and do other tasks since she is right-handed. When the prosthetic arm is attached, further occupational therapy sessions will teach Abbas how to use it.PCRF will likely try to renew Abbas’s visa in May for another six months since she is still undergoing medical care, said Hailat. She and her sister will return to Egypt and live independently through help from PCRF and donations from the community when her treatment ends.Earlier this year, volunteer tutors who are bilingual in Arab and English began teaching Abbas English as a second language. They are also tutoring her in math and science using a Palestinian curriculum for the 10th grade, the last grade she completed prior to evacuating Gaza.Supporting Abbas requires a delicate balance of helping her feel welcome while giving her the space to process the trauma of evacuating from a war zone and leaving behind most of her family in Gaza, said Ghannam. The couple’s home has seen a complicated range of emotions with the backdrop of Israel’s war on Gaza. When the ceasefire was announced in mid-January, the sisters were thrilled and exclaimed how enthusiastic they were to eventually return home and for Gaza to be rebuilt. “I am very cautious and pessimistic, and they managed to engulf me with their optimism,” Ghannam said. A few hours later, Abbas became solemn when she learned thatmore than 80 peoplehad been killed in airstrikes directly following the ceasefire announcement.Still, Ghannam said, she is impressed by Abbas’s strength and wonder as she adjusts to life in the US. During the evenings, the family often watch Arabic shows on Netflix together, or take turns choosing their favorite Arabic songs on YouTube. When Abbas saw snow falling outside the window for the first time during the winter, a big smile stretched across her face as she remarked on its beauty. She went outside to touch it and posed for photos with her sister.“When I see them laugh,” Ghannam said, “and when I see them excited about life, that really gives me a good feeling.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsIsrael-Gaza warChildrenHealthPhiladelphiaUS foreign policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Asdescribedby Richard Henry Pratt, an army officer and champion of the project, the aim was to “kill the Indian in him, and save the man”.In the 1930s, Pember’s mother, Bernice Rabideaux, was sent with her siblings toSt Mary’s Catholic Indian boarding school, on the Ojibwe reservation in Odanah, Wisconsin. Bernice was marked for life. On the page, Pember describes how as a young child she responded to her mother’s dark moods by hiding under the kitchen table, making her symbols on its underside. But she also writes about how her mother’s “terrible stories” about the “Sisters School”, about psychological and physical abuse, helped form a bond that never broke.Pember kept writing. A troubled child, she “sharpened a lead pencil into a dagger-like point and wrote microscopic messages and insults to my family on the wall next to the stairs” of the family home in Chicago. Later, she became a reporter.“Writing is so visceral for me,” she said. “I still like writing with a really sharp pencil, I like the sound of it in my notebooks, and I keep them with me all the time. It always hits me when I’m really tired, and the last thing I want to do is write things down, and that’s when I have to do it … It’s just such a part of me, I don’t question it.“There was a lot of drama in my house. All these things were going on. Of course, they weren’t explained to me. They would sort of lower their voices if they knew I was around. And I just hated being an outsider. I wanted to know what was going on.”View image in fullscreenMary Annette Pember.Photograph: Nedahness Rose GreeneMedicine River is an attempt to explain. If recent years have seen a shift in US awareness of the boarding schools and their legacy, that is in large part due to events in Canada, wherediscoveries of unmarked gravesat sites of such institutions prompted anational reckoningof sorts.“We were the model from which Canada drew,” Pember said. “We predated them by quite some time, and we had far more schools. It had an impact on a far greater number of children. But for some reason we just remain stubbornly ignorant of it here in the United States. They were horrible places in which children were brutalized. And of course it wasn’t just the schools. The schools were part of a greater federal assimilationist agenda.“If they had just done the schools to us, it would not have been so bad. But I always think of it as this triple whammy that happened to Native people in the 19th century. It wasremoval[forced relocation west], thenallotment[dividing lands collectively held], then taking the kids away. It was a concerted attack on our culture, our language and our holdings. That was what it was really about. They wanted our land.“The public was averse to outright extermination, so it was framed as a humanitarian policy. I think it is really important to view boarding schools in that context.”Pember’s investigations led her to dark places. Noting that in other spheres, the Catholic church has been forced to reckon with sexual abuse by priests, she said a moment of truth regarding Native boarding schools may yet come – while pointing to milestones already passed includingreportingby Dana Hedgpeth and others for the Washington Post, a class-actionlawsuitin western states, and the revelation of brutaleventsin Alaska.“Native people were not really viewed as actually human,” Pember said. “One of the surprising things I learned in researching the book, was the power of the eugenics movement. I mean, this was not peripheral hogwash. They were teaching this at Harvard. The leaders of the era … supported this whole notion of eugenics. They were using phrases like ‘the final solution’. They stopped short of advocating euthanasia but there were 30 states that allowed involuntary sterilization of people who were considered feeble-minded or in some way racially inferior … I had not realized how foundational that was, to the way the relationship between the federal government and Native people evolved.”For Pember, publication day will not be without a certain irony. As Medicine River was written, the federal government finally engaged, to some extent, with the Indian boarding schools and their lasting harms. Last year brought aninvestigative report, identifying at least 973 student deaths (the Postfoundmore than 3,100), and apresidential apology, delivered by Joe Biden alongside Deb Haaland, the first Indigenous secretary of the interior. But as Medicine River comes out,Donald Trumpis back, assaulting federal agencies with staffing and budget cuts, seeking to obliterate recognition of the US’s racist past.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Unlike mainstream America, we have no tax base, and so we don’t really have good, sustainable infrastructure.

She lost her funding, under some real obscure agency. And that was so sad. They just recently got it, and they were really feeling they were sitting pretty, and now that’s gone.”Hope remains. TheTruth and Healing Commissionon Indian Boarding School Policies in the United States Act, a bipartisan measureintroducedin 2021, is not dead yet. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican senator more independent-minded than most, hastaken it up. Pember noted that if such a commission is formed, it will not have subpoena power, perhaps necessary for co-operation from the Catholic church.Pember is determined to keep the Indian boarding schools in the public eye.“The goal is to record as much as possible the stories that people have,” she said. “To say: ‘Yes, this happened to you. Let’s document this.’”Describing research atMarquette University in Milwaukee, in the archives of the Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions, she said: “The big thing is to make these records available to people. I can tell you how powerful it is just to see your relative’s name printed. To see my mom’s name and my uncles and aunts and my grandmother and grandfather, to see their names on these rosters … was just something really powerful. It said: ‘This happened, and there’s no workaround. There’s no way people can apologize it away. This did happen.’ That’s uniquely powerful.”Medicine Riveris out in the US on 22 AprilExplore more on these topicsBooksNative AmericansIndigenous peoplesHistory booksAutobiography and memoirfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is offloading our cognitive work to AI driving this trend?Helen ThomsonSat 19 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTShareImagine for a moment you are a child in 1941, sitting the common entrance exam for public schools with nothing but a pencil and paper. You read the following: “Write, for no more than a quarter of an hour, about a British author.”Today, most of us wouldn’t need 15 minutes to ponder such a question. We’d get the answer instantly by turning to AI tools such as Google Gemini,ChatGPTor Siri. Offloading cognitive effort to artificial intelligence has become second nature, but with mounting evidence that human intelligence is declining, some experts fear this impulse is driving the trend.Of course, this isn’t the first time that new technology has raised concerns. Studies already show how mobile phones distract us, social media damages our fragile attention spans and GPS has rendered our navigational abilities obsolete. Now, here comes an AI co-pilot to relieve us of our most cognitively demanding tasks – from handling tax returns to providing therapy and even telling us how to think.Where does that leave our brains? Free to engage in more substantive pursuits or wither on the vine as we outsource our thinking to faceless algorithms?“The greatest worry in these times of generative AI is not that itmaycompromise human creativity or intelligence,” says psychologistRobert Sternbergat Cornell University, who is known for his groundbreaking work on intelligence, “but that it already has.”The argument that we are becoming less intelligent draws from several studies. Some of the most compelling are those that examine the Flynn effect – the observed increase in IQ over successive generations throughout the world since at least 1930, attributed to environmental factors rather than genetic changes. But in recent decades,the Flynn effect has slowedor even reversed.In the UK, James Flynn himself showed that theaverage IQ of a 14-year-old droppedby more than two points between 1980 and 2008. Meanwhile, global study the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) shows an unprecedented drop inmaths, reading and science scoresacross many regions, with young people also showing poorer attention spans and weaker critical thinking.James Flynn: IQ may go up as well as downRead moreNevertheless, while these trends are empirical and statistically robust, their interpretations are anything but. “Everyone wants to point the finger at AI as the boogeyman, but that should be avoided,” saysElizabeth Dworak, at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, who recently identified hints of a reversal of the Flynn effect in a large sample of the US population tested between 2006 and 2018.Intelligence is far more complicated than that, and probably shaped by many variables – micronutrients such as iodine are known to affect brain development and intellectual abilities, likewise changes in prenatal care, number of years in education, pollution, pandemics and technology all influence IQ, making it difficult to isolate the impact of a single factor. “We don’t act in a vacuum, and we can’t point to one thing and say, ‘That’s it,’” says Dworak.Still, while AI’s impact on overall intelligence is challenging to quantify (at least in the short term), concerns about cognitive offloading diminishing specific cognitive skills are valid – and measurable.Studies have suggested that the use of AI for memory-related tasks may lead to a decline in an individual’s own memory capacityWhen considering AI’s impact on our brains, most studies focus on generative AI (GenAI) – the tool that has allowed us to offload more cognitive effort than ever before. Anyone who owns a phone or a computer can access almost any answer, write any essay or computer code, produce art or photography – all in an instant. There have been thousands of articles written about the many ways in which GenAI has the potential to improve our lives, through increased revenues, job satisfaction and scientific progress, to name a few. In 2023, Goldman Sachs estimated that GenAI could boost annual global GDP by 7% over a 10-year period – an increase of roughly$7tn.The fear comes, however, from the fact that automating these tasks deprives us of the opportunity to practise those skills ourselves, weakening the neural architecture that supports them. Just as neglecting our physical workouts leads to muscle deterioration, outsourcing cognitive effort atrophies neural pathways.One of our most vital cognitive skills at risk is critical thinking. Why consider what you admire about a British author when you can get ChatGPT to reflect on that for you?Research underscores these concerns.Michael Gerlichat SBS Swiss Business School in Kloten, Switzerland, tested 666 people in the UK and found a significant correlation between frequent AI use and lower critical-thinking skills – with younger participants who showed higher dependence on AI tools scoring lower in critical thinking compared with older adults.Similarly, a study by researchers atMicrosoft and Carnegie Mellon Universityin Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania surveyed 319 people in professions that use GenAI at least once a week. While it improved their efficiency, it also inhibited critical thinking and fostered long-term overreliance on the technology, which the researchers predict could result in a diminished ability to solve problems without AI support.“It’s great to have all this information at my fingertips,” said one participant in Gerlich’s study, “but I sometimes worry that I’m not really learning or retaining anything. I rely so much on AI that I don’t think I’d know how to solve certain problems without it.” Indeed, other studies have suggested that the use of AI systems for memory-related tasksmay lead to a decline in an individual’s own memory capacity.This erosion of critical thinking is compounded by the AI-driven algorithms that dictate what we see on social media. “The impact of social media on critical thinking is enormous,” says Gerlich. “To get your video seen, you have four seconds to capture someone’s attention.” The result? A flood of bite-size messages that are easily digested but don’t encourage critical thinking. “It gives you information that you don’t have to process any further,” says Gerlich.By being served information rather than acquiring that knowledge through cognitive effort, the ability to critically analyse the meaning, impact, ethics and accuracy of what you have learned is easily neglected in the wake of what appears to be a quick and perfect answer. “To be critical of AI is difficult – you have to be disciplined. It is very challenging not to offload your critical thinking to these machines,” says Gerlich.Wendy Johnson, who studies intelligence at Edinburgh University, sees this in her students every day. She emphasises that it is not something she has tested empirically but believes that students are too ready to substitute independent thinking with letting the internet tell them what to do and believe.Without critical thinking, it is difficult to ensure that we consume AI-generated content wisely. It may appear credible, particularly as you become more dependent on it, but don’t be fooled. A 2023 study inScience Advancesshowed that, compared with humans, GPT-3 chat not only produces information that is easier to understandbut also more compelling disinformation.Why does that matter? “Think of a hypothetical billionaire,” says Gerlich. “They create their own AI and they use that to influence people because they can train it in a specific way to emphasise certain politics or certain opinions. If there is trust and dependency on it, the question arises of how much it is influencing our thoughts and actions.”AI’s effect on creativity is equally disconcerting. Studies show that AI tends to help individuals produce more creative ideas than they can generate alone. However, across the whole population,AI-concocted ideas are less diverse, which ultimately means fewer “Eureka!” moments.Sternberg captures these concerns in a recent essay in theJournal of Intelligence: “Generative AI is replicative. It can recombine and re-sort ideas, but it is not clear that it will generate the kinds of paradigm-breaking ideas the world needs to solve the serious problems that confront it, such as global climate change, pollution, violence, increasing income disparities, and creeping autocracy.”To ensure that you maintain your ability to think creatively, you might want to consider how you engage with AI – actively or passively.Research by Marko Müller from the University of Ulmin Germany shows a link between social media use and higher creativity in younger people but not in older generations. Digging into the data, he suggests this may be to do with the difference in how people who were born in the era of social media use it compared with those who came to it later in life. Younger people seem to benefit creatively from idea-sharing and collaboration, says Müller, perhaps because they’re more open with what they share online compared with older users, who tend to consume it more passively.Alongside what happenswhileyou use AI, you might spare a thought to what happensafteryou use it. Cognitive neuroscientist John Kounios from Drexel University in Philadelphia explains that, just like anything else that is pleasurable, our brain gets a buzz from having a sudden moment of insight, fuelled by activity in our neural reward systems. These mental rewards help us remember our world-changing ideas and also modify our immediate behaviour, making us less risk averse – this is all thought to drive further learning, creativity and opportunities. But insights generated from AI don’t seem to have such a powerful effect in the brain. “The reward system is an extremely important part of brain development, and we just don’t know what the effect of using these technologies will have downstream,” says Kounios. “Nobody’s tested that yet.”There are other long-term implications to consider. Researchers have only recently discovered thatlearning a second language, for instance, helps delay the onset of dementia for around four years, yet in many countries, fewer students are applying for language courses. Giving up a second language in favour of AI-powered instant-translation apps might be the reason, but none of these can – so far – claim to protect your future brain health.As Sternberg warns, we need to stop asking what AI can doforus and start asking what it is doingtous. Until we know for sure, the answer, according to Gerlich, is to “train humans to be more human again – using critical thinking, intuition – the things that computers can’t yet do and where we can add real value.”We can’t expect the big tech companies to help us do this, he says. No developer wants to be told their program works too well; makes it too easy for a person to find an answer. “So it needs to start in schools,” says Gerlich. “AI is here to stay. We have to interact with it, so we need to learn how to do that in the right way.” If we don’t, we won’t just make ourselves redundant, but our cognitive abilities too.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)The ObserverChatbotsComputingChatGPTGooglefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then, the day before liberation, Nazis smashed down their front door …Thomas HardingSat 19 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Apr 2025 16.26 EDTShareEarly on the morning of 3 August 1944, a unit of heavily armed German soldiers arrived at the Villa Il Focardo outside Florence.They didn’t knock. They didn’t ring the bell. They simply smashed through the front door, marched in and started shouting for the villa’s owner, Robert Einstein, cousin of the world-famous scientistAlbert Einstein.Robert and Albert had grown up together in Munich, Germany, in the 1880s and 1890s. For 11 years they had lived in the same house. You could say they were brother-cousins. Their fathers, Jakob and Hermann Einstein, were in business together, running an electrification company. Over the years, they had brought electric light to beer halls, town squares and cafes.In 1894, the Einstein company failed to win a large contract and went bankrupt. The two families moved to Milan and started again. When this business also went bust, the brothers parted ways but the cousins remained close. Robert stayed in Italy, qualified as an engineer and married Nina Mazzetti, a priest’s daughter from the north. In the 1920s, they moved to a small apartment in Rome and began building a life.View image in fullscreenRobert Einstein.Photograph: Il Nuovo CorriereThis was around the time that Benito Mussolini and his National Fascist Party (PNF) took power. The fascists were, at this point, not particularly antisemitic and Jews were as likely to be party members as the rest of the population. For his part, the Jewish Robert Einstein did not join the fascists, but as a businessman he was sympathetic towards their investment in public infrastructure and modernisation of the government.Meanwhile, Albert Einstein had returned to Germany and published his paper on relativity. In 1922, he was awarded the Nobel prize and was the most famous scientist in the world.As it happens, I have a personal connection to the Einsteins. Our two families knew each other in Berlin in the 1920s. My grandmother used to tell a story from when she was a child. One day, Albert Einstein and his wife came for dinner at the family’s apartment on Kaiserallee near the Kurfürstendamm. She recalled peering through the keyhole of the dining room door and seeing that the great scientist was wearing house slippers, confirming rumours of his forgetful nature.After the meal, her father, Alfred Alexander, escorted Albert to the salon to take coffee, intending to quiz him about the theory of relativity. But when he climbed into bed later that night, Alfred confessed to his wife that he and his guest had become so engrossed in discussing the latest detective novels that he had forgotten to ask.The two men also had a professional relationship. My great-grandfather was the Einstein family doctor. On 27 April 1926, Albert Einstein wrote a letter thanking my great-grandfather for the treatment he had provided to his terminally ill uncle and aunt: “Dear and esteemed Dr Alexander!” Albert said. “Words cannot express the good you have done for my family.” Having detailed the specifics of the treatment, he ended with a sentence that imagined a tactile link between the two families: “Clasping your hand in sincere gratitude, A Einstein.”Neither Albert nor Alfred had a sense of the horror their families would soon face.In 1934, Robert and Nina Einstein were still living in Rome when Nina’s brother asked them for help. His wife had died and he was struggling to look after their seven-year-old twins. Robert and Nina had two girls of their own (Luce, who was 17, and Cici, who was eight), but they agreed to take in their two nieces.The Rome apartment was now too crowded. Robert and Nina shared a love of nature and decided the time was right to move to the countryside. They found a villa outside Florence called Il Focardo. It had a peach orchard, vines and olive trees. Perhaps most importantly, it came with 10 contadini, or farmers, who would help manage the estate. It was paradise.In May 1938, Adolf Hitler was invited to Florence by Mussolini. Desperate to impress his visitor, the Italian leader spent vast sums cleaning up the buildings, parks and streets, then gave the Führer a pomp-filled guided tour of the city. Travelling in a 20-car motorcade, they were cheered on by tens of thousands of flag-waving Italians, right arms raised to the sky in the fascist salute. The two men appeared to bond during this trip.View image in fullscreenBenito Mussolini driving through the streets of Florence with Adolf Hitler in May 1938.Photograph: Sueddeutsche Zeitung Photo/AlamySix months later, on 11 November 1938, to the shock of Italian Jews, Mussolini announced the introduction of racial laws (similar to the Nazis’ Nuremberg laws). The legislation was approved by parliament and signed into law byKing Vittorio Emanuele III. Jewish children were forbidden to attend public schools and universities. Jews could no longer work in banks, insurance companies or local government. They could not marry non-Jews, serve in the army or be PNF members.In practice, these laws were intermittently enforced, dependent on the whims of the local police and party officials. As a result, the Einsteins’ lives at Il Focardo were little affected. Luce continued to attend medical school in Florence. Cici and her cousins went to the local high school, while Robert and Nina managed the estate.This sense of relative calm changed in the autumn of 1943, when the German army swept through northern Italy and occupied Florence and its surrounding area. On 1 December, Mussolini’s minister of the interior, Guido Buffarini Guidi, announced on national radio Police Order Number 5, including this command: all Jews were to be rounded up and put in concentration camps.Over the next seven months, more than 8,000 Jews were arrested, amounting to 20% of the Italian Jewish population. The roundups, or razzia as they were called in Italy, were carried out by German SS and police forces, supported by Italian fascists.Robert and Nina were still living at Il Focardo with their two daughters and two nieces. They had been joined by Nina’s sister Seba and a third niece, Anna Maria, the daughter of another of Nina’s sisters whose family thought she would be safer in the country.Over the next days and weeks, Robert and his family watched in horror as Jews across Tuscany were arrested and put on trains to Auschwitz. It was too late for the Einsteins to flee. With the railway stations, airports and border crossings carefully monitored, the Nazis and their Italian partners made it impossible to leave.View image in fullscreenRobert Einstein and family at Villa Il Focardo outside Florence.Photograph: courtesy of Anna Maria BoldriniBut the Einsteins still thought they were safe. They were tucked away in the villa, far off the beaten track. Nina and the other female family members were Christian and therefore would not be a target of the roundups. And while Robert was Jewish, he was an Italian citizen and much respected locally. It was unlikely that anyone would give him away.This dark period underlines another connection between my family and the Einsteins. We also experienced the horrors of fascist persecution. My family was German Jewish. My grandmother was thrown out of Heidelberg University because of her religion. Her father had to close his business, as Jews were not allowed to practise medicine. The Nazis stole our family’s precioushouse by the lakeoutside Berlin.Most of my family were able to get out of Nazi Germany, including my grandmother and her parents. They were very grateful when they found refuge in England. But five of my relatives were not so lucky. They were still in Berlin when, in 1943, the Nazis organised their latest roundup. All were murdered in the Holocaust.By the third week of July 1944, the allies were quickly moving up through Italy from the south. At night, planes could be heard buzzing overhead. There was talk that Florence might fall in a few weeks.It was the height of the Tuscan summer. The sun beat down unrelentingly. Thecontadini were working in Il Focardo’s orchards, harvesting the peaches. And it was then that Robert heard there was a German unit looking for him. According to the local priest and an owner of a nearby estate, the soldiers had specifically mentioned he was the cousin of Albert Einstein.Why would the Germans want to track down Albert Einstein’s relative in Italy? A decade earlier, in 1933, the great scientist had fled Germany when he learned the Nazis wanted to kill him. This was hardly a secret. Newspapers across Europe carried front page stories stating that Hitler wanted Einstein assassinated. London’s Daily Herald announced “Price placed on Einstein’s head”, adding this was valued at £1,000 – equivalent to about half a million pounds today.Fearing for his life, Albert had fled to England, where heholed upfor a few days in Norfolk. He then took a boat with his wife to the US and moved into a house in Princeton, New Jersey.If anything, Hitler’s hatred of Albert Einstein had intensified over the intervening years. The scientist had very publicly criticised the Nazi regime in the newspapers andraised moneyfor the war effort. He had also provided support to the US military (given its secrecy, it is unlikely that Hitler knew of Einstein’s involvement with theManhattan Project).By the summer of 1944, he was, if anything, considered by the Nazi regime to be even more of an enemy than in 1933. The threat of assassination was still very real.The problem, for the Nazis, was that living in the US, the famous physicist was well beyond their reach. The same was true of his nearest relatives. Albert’s wife, stepdaughter, sister and eldest son were all living in the US, while his first wife and youngest son were in neutral Switzerland.This left his cousin, Robert, as his closest relative living in Nazi-occupied Europe.After hearing the Germans were looking for him, Robert and Nina decided he must go into hiding. It was agreed Nina and the girls would stay at the villa; after all, they were Christian, what harm could come to them?So it was that, in late July 1944, Robert kissed his family goodbye and headed up the rocky track towards the woods behind the villa. There he would remain for the next two weeks, sleeping in a different spot each night.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Coming to see him one day with supplies, Nina confirmed this. She had heard on the BBC radio that the allies were 20 miles south of Florence. They might be in the city later that week. The prospect of liberation after years of war was thrilling.View image in fullscreenRobert Einstein with his wife Nina …View image in fullscreen… and Nina with their daughters, Luce and Cici. Photographs: courtesy of Anna Maria BoldriniThis is how things stood when, at 7am on 3 August 1944, the group of heavily armed Germans smashed through the front door of the villa. Alerted by the noise, Nina ran to see what was happening. She found seven soldiers standing in the front hallway. She was soon joined by her two daughters, sister and three nieces. Having lived for a while with her husband in Munich, Nina could speak a few words in German. She demanded to know what was going on. How dare they barge into her house like this?The intruders were led by a captain who looked to be in his early 30s. He was of average height, had a gaunt face, short-cropped blond hair and wore round metal glasses. Unlike the other soldiers who carried machine guns, the captain had only a pistol which was tucked into a holster on his belt. Ignoring Nina’s umbrage, he demanded to know the whereabouts of the patrone. Where was the cousin of Albert Einstein?Nina didn’t answer. The German asked again, his voice rising. She maintained her silence. When the captain looked to the others, they also kept quiet.Frustrated, the captain ordered the seven women to be taken into the cellar. They were pushed along a narrow corridor, then through an open metal door and down some steep wooden steps. Once they were downstairs, the door was closed and locked with a clank.In the cellar, the quiet was pierced by the creak of the door, followed by the heavy sound of boots coming down the stairsOver the next few hours, the hostages followed what was going on upstairs. They heard the shuffle of boots overhead: it seemed the soldiers were exploring the villa’s every nook and cranny. Later came the sound of corks popping, followed by the clinking of glasses, cheering and laughter. After that, there was the rumble of large pieces of furniture being dragged across the floor and the unmistakable sound of a ping-pong game being played. By mid-afternoon, things had calmed down. Perhaps the soldiers were resting?Robert, meanwhile, was still in the woods. He had seen the German soldiers arrive in their military vehicles. He was terrified but paralysed by indecision. Should he stay out of sight or run to the villa and protect his family? If he did the latter, what then? He was unarmed and alone. In the end he decided to stick with the plan. Given the allies were quickly approaching, surely the soldiers would not stick around for long. After stealing supplies and anything else of value, they would move on.Back in the cellar, the quiet was pierced by the creak of the metal door, followed by the sound of boots coming down the stairs. “Raus!” a soldier screamed. “Raus! Raus!”‘No one wants a Nazi in their family’: a German prisoner of war, a secret affair and the mystery of my dad’s parentageRead moreNina was taken to the living room for questioning, while the other six women were locked in an upstairs bedroom. The captain demanded that she disclose her husband’s whereabouts and sensing she had to give him something, Nina said she sometimes met her husband in the woods, but she never knew where he would be. To find him, she called his name. Satisfied he was at last getting somewhere, the captain told two of his men to escort Nina outside to search for Robert.By now it was dark, but their way was illuminated by a full moon. As they walked up the rocky track towards the woods, Nina called her husband’s name.“Roberto,” she cried, “Roberto.” When there was no response, they continued on. She called again. “Roberto! Roberto.” Again there was nothing.When Robert had first gone into hiding, they had discussed exactly this scenario. If Nina came looking for him at a time they had not previously agreed, he was to stay hidden, so this is exactly what he did. He heard his wife call for him, but did not come out.After 30 minutes, the soldiers realised their efforts were futile. They returned to the villa and informed the captain. Furious, he told his men to bring down Nina’s daughters, Luce and Cici. He would press them for details. And if they still refused to help, he would be forced to take drastic measures.Robert was standing in the woods when he heard a noise that filled him with terror. It was the sound of machine guns firing. He started to run.A few minutes later, he bumped into his nieces and sister-in-law, who were fleeing the villa. Robert was desperate to know what had happened. Where were his wife and daughters? Were they OK?They told him the terrible news: Nina, Luce and Cici had been murdered. Their bodies were back at the villa. The Germans had set the building on fire. Robert screamed in anguish and collapsed to the ground.At almost exactly the same time that Robert heard the machine-gun fire, Germans blew up five of the bridges across the Arno River in Florence. They then retreated to the north. Early next morning, 4 August 1944, New Zealand soldiers arrived in Florence. The city was liberated.Six weeks later, an American war crimes investigator sent a letter to Albert Einstein informing him that his cousin’s family had been murdered in Italy. The news was devastating.View image in fullscreenA letter to Albert Einstein informing him of the death of Nina and her daughters.Photograph: © The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel. Digital image photographed Ardon Bar HamaA year later, Albert would hear more terrible news from Italy. Overwhelmed by guilt and grief, Robert had taken an overdose of sleeping pills. He died in a hospital in Florence on 13 July 1945.After the war, my family lost contact with the Einsteins. They were living in the US and Switzerland; we were in London. The only remaining evidence of a connection was the letter from Albert Einstein to my great-grandfather.But contact was made again when I met Robert Einstein’s niece, Anna Maria. Though in her 90s, she still had a clear memory of the dreadful events of August 1944.She told me it was the worst day of her life; she was still terrorised by what happened.She was also confident about why the murder had taken place. It had been ordered at the very highest level in the Nazi regime. Robert had been targeted because he was the cousin of Albert Einstein. And as Robert was not available, they had brutally murdered his wife and daughters. It was a vendetta.The Einstein Vendetta by Thomas Harding is published by Michael Joseph at £22.

Outside a closed graphic design shop overlooking them from a small hill, Solange Ndonga Tibesa tells the story of being uprooted from her homeland in north-westCameroon.In June 2019 she and other travellers were abducted with her three-month-old baby by secessionists, who accused them of supporting the military. Their captors repeatedly hit them with butts of their guns, keeping them in a forest without food or water.“We stayed in a forest there for two days. My baby cried [so much]... and we just became used to the mosquitoes,” said the 30-year-old. “One of the boys was asking me to take off my clothes but I begged: ‘It’s better if you just kill me than rape me,’ before the other boys intervened.”View image in fullscreenPaul Biya is seeking his eighth term as Cameroon’s president, a position he has held since 1982.Photograph: Charles Platiau/ReutersIn October, Cameroon goes to the polls, with 92-year-old Paul Biya, its president since 1982, running for an eighth term. An estimated 6.9 million people are registered to vote, but Tibesa, who fled into Cross River state in neighbouringNigeriaafter her release, is one of thousands who cannot vote even if they wanted to.The vast majority of Nigeria’s eastern flank is with Cameroon. The entire corridor is swallowed by two overlapping axes of migration due to conflict: in the upper half are mostly Nigerians fleeing jihadists such asBoko Haramand theIslamic West Africa Province; in the bottom half are Cameroonians fleeing a civil war in the English-speaking minority areas since 2017.About 107,000 refugees have come into Nigeria from Cameroon alone, according to figures from the UNHCR, the UN’s refugee agency.Approximately half of that number live in and around Adagom, Cross River state, where 63 hectares (156 acres) of land donated by the Nigerian government hosts open settlements. The UNHCR pays households in these communities a monthly stipend and teaches skills acquisitions.View image in fullscreenMany Cameroonian refugees have integrated into life in neighbouring Nigeria, but long to return to their homeland and the life they left behind.Photograph: Eromo Egbejule/The ObserverMany refugees have integrated with their Nigerian neighbours, some marrying each other, and passionately arguing about winning or losing bets on football matches. That similar dialects of pidgin English and Ejagham are spoken on both sides of the border has also helped. That has enabled many such as Tibesa to put trauma behind them to plough on.She is now working on being an all-rounder: she coaches a netball team, volunteers as a social worker and has taken classes in biofuel production and plastics recycling.Next to her, Tessy Ekpang, 29, who says soldiers killed two of her uncles, cannot wait to head to Kenya this month to begin studying pharmacy, courtesy of a fully funded scholarship.A five-minute drive away, an agricultural engineer named Edmund is fabricating solar power systems next to his fish pond with 3,000 fingerlings on a land sold to him by the Adagom community.The land that is now Cameroon was carved apart and patched together by European powers in the 19th and 20th century with little regard for its citizens or sense of national identity. A century ago, the entire country was the German colony of Kamerun.After the first world war, it was split between the British, which also administered neighbouring Nigeria, and the French. In a 1961 UN plebiscite, southern Cameroons voted to rejoin Cameroon, while northern Cameroons joined Nigeria.Now a predominantly Francophone nation, it has two anglophone regions in the west. For decades, anglophones complained of being treated as “second-class citizens”.When the military tried to quellpeaceful protestsabout appointments of French-speaking judges and teachers in the English-speaking minority areas in 2016, armed groups known as “Amba Boys” clashed with them and declared the breakaway republic ofAmbazonia.The impact on the civilian population has been massive: among other things, schools were closed as bridges were cut in two, disconnecting villages. More than 4,000 civilians have been killed and at least 712,000 displaced within and outside the country. “No single person is in my village again,” said Ekpang.Aid workers say half of the combined 4 million people in both regions are in need of humanitarian support, which could now be hampered bythe reshaping of foreign aid.In 2024, the US funded approximately half of UNHCR’s budget in Nigeria. “We are deeply concerned by the growing gap between needs and resources, and the massive impact [funding cuts] will have on millions of people displaced by war and persecution,” said Alpha Seydi Ba, a Dakar-based UNHCR representative.‘The fight is existential’: Cameroon’s anglophone leaders lead a revolution from behind barsRead moreMany say the conflict lingers because the government is unwilling to decentralise power or engage with the separatists, which it has described as terrorists. Many young men suspected of being separatists have been detained in prisons, according to Human Rights Watch.A national dialogue organised in 2019 by Biya’s government failed as key separatist movements were not included. Canada and Switzerland have also separately tried to mediate in the crisis but with little success.October’s election could, therefore, be crucial for any peace efforts. If Biya wins, as is widely expected, many expect business as usual. If his health keeps him from the ballot, it is rumoured that he and the party will appoint his 53-year-old son, Franck Biya, to run in his stead.Analysts say there must be a push for dialogue again regardless of the election’s outcome. “Cameroon’s international partners should press for inclusive dialogue to resume… [and] highlight the need to strengthen governance and expedite decentralisation so the anglophone regions benefit from the autonomy their ‘special status’ should have granted them,” said Hubert Kinkoh, a researcher with the Institute for Security Studies in Addis Ababa.For the refugees in Adagom, the clock is ticking and the losses rising.Tibesa would love to be able to return to Cameroon. “But when I see pictures of people that have been killed, I just burst out into tears because I really love my country,” she said. “But nobody is safe. If you run to the army, the Amba Boys will pursue you.

One company boasted that its robot looked almost human, with feminine features and the ability to wink and smile. Some firms tested their robots for weeks before the race. Beijing officials have described the event as more akin to motor racing, given the need for engineering and navigation teams.“The robots are running very well, very stable … I feel I’m witnessing the evolution of robots and AI,” said spectator He Sishu, who works in artificial intelligence.View image in fullscreenEngineers run with a humanoid robot.Photograph: Tingshu Wang/ReutersThe robots were accompanied by human trainers, some of whom had to physically support the machines during the race. A few of the robots wore running shoes, with one wearing boxing gloves and another had a red headband with the words “Bound to Win” in Chinese.The winning robot was Tiangong Ultra, from the Beijing Innovation Centre of Human Robotics, with a time of 2hr 40min. The men’s winner of the race had a time of 1hr 2min. The centre is 43% owned by two state-owned enterprises, while tech giant Xiaomi’s robotics arm and leading Chinese humanoid robot firm UBTech have equal share in the rest.View image in fullscreenTiangong Ultra at the awards ceremony.Photograph: Jessica Lee/EPATang Jian, chief technology officer for the robotics centre, said Tiangong Ultra’s performance was aided by long legs and an algorithm allowing it to imitate how humans run a marathon. “I don’t want to boast but no other robotics firms in the West have matched Tiangong’s sporting achievements,” Tang said, adding that the robot’s batteries were switched three times during the race.Some robots struggled from the beginning. One fell at the starting line and lay flat for a few minutes before getting up and taking off. Another crashed into a railing after running a few metres, causing its human operator to fall over.View image in fullscreenA support technician falls as a humanoid robot crashes while running.Photograph: Kevin Frayer/Getty ImagesAlthough humanoid robots have made appearances at marathons inChinaover the past year, this is the first time they have raced alongside humans.

Asked during a leaders’ debate on the ABC whether extreme weather events were worsening, the opposition leader said:“I don’t know because I’m not a scientist”.Dutton later said he“believes in climate change”and the Coalition was committed to Australia having net zero emissions by 2050.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterBut climate experts said its policies would boost local fossil fuel use, send the country backwards on emissions, put the net zero goal beyond reach and damage its reputation internationally.Bill Hare, a scientist and the Australia-based chief executive of Climate Analytics, said the Coalition’s positions were “almost totally regressive in the sense that they would unwind action in Australia”.He said if people accepted Dutton’s claim the Coalitionwanted to abolish a national legislated 2030 emissions target– a 43% cut below 2005 levels – but still supported getting to net zero emissions without introducing new policies “you are being taken for a mug”.The trend is in, but Australian voters’ views are soft and fragmented – how should we read the polls?Read more“It is too late to be listening to empty promises like that,” Hare said.The Grattan Institute’s energy and climate change program director, Tony Wood, said “every single one” of the Coalition’s policies in the area was “a reduction in ambition or slowing down emissions reductions”.“None of it is adding to emissions reductions,” he said. “It would be bordering on incredible to think that we could maintain a commitment to net zero by 2050 with no plans to head us in the direction for the next 10 to 15 years.”Guardian Australia asked the Coalition if it had any policies that would reduce emissions over the next decade. The shadow minister for climate change and energy, Ted O’Brien, replied it had a “track record of reducing emissions” and would continue to “advocate for solutions that deliver affordable, reliable and sustainable energy for all Australians”.He did not specify a Coalition policy that would cut emissions in the next 10 years.The Coalition’s policies include:Dropping a Labor goal of 82% of electricity coming from renewable generation by 2030 and slowing the rollout of solar and windfarms, in part by scrapping a “rewiring the nation” fund to build new transmission connections. Instead, it says the country would rely on more fossil fuels – coal and gas-fired power – until it could lift a ban on nuclear energy andbuild taxpayer-owned nuclear generators, mostly after 2040.Abolishing fines for car companies that do not meet targets to cut the average emissions from the new cars they sell.Not supporting Labor’s 2030 emissions reduction target. Former diplomats say lowering the target would put Australiain breach of commitments made in the 2015 Paris climate agreement.Opposinga joint Australia-Pacific bidto host a major UN climate summitin Adelaide next year.The Coalition has also said it would reviewthe safeguard mechanism– a policy introduced under Tony Abbott, and revamped under Labor to require major industrial polluters to either make direct cuts or buy carbon offsets – topossibly make it less onerous on business. Industry groups have largely supported Labor’s changes.Lesley Hughes, a professor emerita at Macquarie University and member of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists and the Climate Council, said the last Coalition government “went backwards” on addressing the climate crisis and “there’s nothing to suggest we won’t go backwards under the next Coalition government”.Hare has assessed the likely difference between Labor and the Coalition based on their current policies. He said government projections indicated Labor was headed for a 42.6% cut by 2030 – nearly on track to meet the 43% target – but the Coalition’s released policies would limit the cut to 36%.Zoe Daniel says team had nothing to do with Climate 200-backed robocall criticised by CoalitionRead moreHe pointed to modelling by Frontier Economics released in support of the Coalition’s nuclear plan that assumed Australia wouldget only 54% of its electricity from renewable energy, rather than 82%. “That would slow down emissions reduction dramatically … and would require more gas for the next 15 to 20 years,” Hare said.The Climate Change Authority has estimated it couldincrease national emissions by 2bn tonnes, adding the equivalent of more than four years of total Australian climate pollution.Hare and Wood both said the Coalition’s plan to scrap fines for car companies that did not meet the vehicle efficiency standard would make the policy pointless. “It’s like having a speed limit without a penalty,” Wood said.All experts who spoke with Guardian Australia bemoaned a lack of focus on climate change policy from the major parties given the challenge of reaching net zero and the rising impact of increased temperatures and extreme weather.Labor’s sole new climate policy released in the election has been a30% subsidy for households and small businesses that install batteries. Neither party has announced 2035 emissions targets or released a plan to reach net zero emissions, though Laborbegan work on a planin the last term and has promised a 2035 goal by September if re-elected.Wood said: “It is monumentally disappointing that these issues are not really being discussed by either party.”Hughes said the Great Barrier Reef hadjust suffered its sixth mass bleaching event in nine years, but the major parties seemed to be “quite strenuously avoiding talking about climate impacts.”Hare said the “lack of engagement on climate across the board has been quite depressing”.An initial assessment by the Climate Change Authority founda 2035 emissions reduction target of between 65% and 75%“would be ambitious and could be achievable if additional action is taken”. Organisations representingengineers, scientistsand thesocial service sectorhave called for a target of net zero emissions by 2035, in line with a goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Australian politicsCoalitionClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

It is one of the starkest differences to his 2022 campaign, which was dominated by missteps:forgetting key economic figures, then his untimely Covid diagnosis and images of beingchased out of a press conference by journalists.This time, he’s on top and he knows it. This week’s Guardian Essential poll puts himin an election-winning position. Peter Dutton is running out of time to stage a comeback.Still, there is a quiet carefulness to Albanese’s campaigning – he knows first-hand how quickly a campaign can come off the tracks, and how a written-off underdog can win from behind.4:48The housing crisis isn't sparing Peter Dutton's son, and Albanese won't spare a hug – videoI’m fresh back from a week on Albanese’s campaign bus. Earlier, I tailed the Liberal leader on his first week in the campaign pressure cooker. From up close and afar, the two campaigns are different beasts.Albanese bounds into the public eye, often accompanied by a number of his higher-profile ministers; Dutton is on constant high alert, still adjusting to the barrage of questioning he faces each day. While the prime minister cracks jokes or waxes lyrical over his footy team, his rival seems to end most press conferences with a negative story, a backtrack or leaving more questions than answers.One of Albanese’s few missteps – literally and figuratively – was to claim he didn’t fall off a stage in week one. It was a weird moment, given the media pack was there to see (and film) it, even if the instinctual reaction was to downplay misfortune. The Coalition campaign machine pounced on it, desperate for any crack in the Labor facade; the “Albo lied about falling off the stage” attack hasn’t really taken hold anywhere beyondLiberal partymemes, but that hasn’t stopped them.Australian Labor party sent team to UK to learn from Keir Starmer’s successful election campaignRead moreThis week’s debate saw another, more consequential flub, when Albanese claimed Labor had never commissioned modelling on negative gearing changes. It was the opening for Dutton’s best punch of the night, Albanese looking uncomfortable as Dutton claimed his opponent “has a problem with the truth”. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, had earlier said it was“not unusual” for governments to get such advice, even as he stressed it wasn’t on their radar – and was rolled out to help clean up the situation the next day, splitting hairs that the government had received “advice” not “modelling”.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterTheCoalitionthis week launched an “Albanese Live Lie Tracker”. Both sides are doing this; Labor’s campaign machine sends out a tally of Dutton’s “daily lies” to journalists.Some Liberals quietly grumble that the respective press packs are grilling Dutton harder than they are Albanese. Having been on both campaign buses now, with a revolving cast of press gallery colleagues and competitors, I can say it’s not for the reason Dutton sympathisers might like to think.Albanese has fronted up often to tough TV and radio interviews or all-in press conferences over his three years; Dutton has not. Whereas Labor has consistently released policy over their time in government, the Coalition has left much of their heavy lifting and reform ideas to the last minute.This means many Labor policies have already been thoroughly raked over in the lead-up to the poll, as has Albanese on his mistakes. Dutton, on the other hand, is facing his inquisition now, in the more intense period right before voters make up their minds.To be sure, Albanese is still – rightly – getting fresh questions over Labor’s promise last election to cut $275 from power bills, their energy systems plan and new promises on housing, tax and cost of living. He has gotten cranky at times, snipping a little too vehemently at a question he didn’t like and downplaying the journalist as a “state correspondent”; he rubbishes questions about minority government and potential cooperation with the Greens, not bothering to disguise expressions of annoyance or dismissiveness.But there’s only so many times you can write the same story – which leaves Albanese breathing room for lighthearted podcasts, or a ferry ride with journalists.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hisserious error(slip of the tongue or pure mistake) in claiming the Indonesian president had announced that Russian planes would be stationed on Biak island, gave Labor fresh ammo for their “reckless and risky” attack. And confusion and a deliberate lack of clarity over public service cuts leaves Dutton looking evasive and tricky whenever he’s asked.Train takes, diss tracks and TikTok clips: politicians pull out the stops to win over gen Z votersRead moreThe opposition leader couldn’t even catch a break when he finally let down the shutters to kick a footy around with a few local kids in Darwin. During his only really easygoing press appearance this campaign, a wayward kick sent the ball crashing into a TV camera, leaving the operator with a bleeding gash on his head.Dutton’s campaign is workmanlike.

JoiningGuardian Australia’s Full Story podcast on Thursday, he downed a piccolo at 3pm, a caffeine boost ahead of a few engagements he said lay ahead into the afternoon and evening.On two separate occasions this week he brought up, unprompted, his plan to watch Star Wars on 4 May (“May the Fourth”) after election day. Journalists and even his own staff barely manage to suppress quiet groans when he goes off on a tangent at each media appearance about a local infrastructure project he’s backed nearby, or about his dog.Others have commented at how few genuine public interactions both men have had on this campaign. Security threats detailed recently partly explain the reticence, even as Albanesespoke this week of how he enjoys getting out to meet punters.With two weeks until election day, Albanese looks in control. But there’s still a long way to go before he knows whether he’ll be watching Star Wars from his couch in The Lodge as a winner, or in his own home in Sydney after election defeat.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Anthony AlbaneseLabor partyPeter DuttonAustralian politicsCoalitionLiberal partyanalysisShareReuse this content"

The Guardian has confirmed that a charge was laid.Russia has indicted other foreign prisoners of war.“We continue to hold serious concerns for Mr Jenkins and are working with Ukraine and other partners to advocate for his welfare and release.” a spokesperson for Australia’s department of foreign affairs and trade said.The ABC reported that the indictment claimed “a citizen of Australia, on his own initiative, in order to receive material remuneration, arrived on the territory of Ukraine to participate as a mercenary in an armed conflict with the Russian Federation on the side of enemy troops”.The ABC also cited local media claiming he was paid up to $15,000 a month to fight on Ukraine’s side against Russia.The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has said Jenkins was being held as a prisoner of war, which would mean he should be afforded the protection of international humanitarian law. But Moscow referred to him as a mercenary, which would mean he is not covered by the conventions.Anthony Albanese said on Saturday the Australian government would “stand up and use whatever avenues we have at our disposal to continue to make those representations [on behalf of Jenkins] … both to Russia, but also, of course, through our friends in Ukraine, who have also made representations as well”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As an officer approached on foot, the car allegedly “accelerated towards the officer” and the officer discharged a firearm at the car.“The vehicle then collided with a police car and drove away,” Radmore said. Neither of the two police officers at the scene were injured.The vehicle was spotted by a member of the public in North Bondi at 6.30am and shortly afterwards a 37-year-old man who is known to police was taken into custody.“It was necessary to take him to hospital for an assessment, and we will continue our inquiries when he’s released,” Radmore said. She said she was not aware of any physical injuries.Police checks revealed the vehicle was stolen from Double Bay on Friday night, Radmore said.On the officer’s decision to discharge a firearm, Radmore said police “review all matters involving police use of force in a number of ways, and that will come out through the investigation”.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

There was no indication he metPope Francis, who has resumed some official duties during his recovery from pneumonia.The Holy See has responded cautiously to theTrump administration, in keeping with its tradition of diplomatic neutrality.It has expressed alarm over Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigration and cuts in international aid, and has called for peaceful resolutions to the wars inUkraineand Gaza.US supreme court orders temporary halt to deportations of Venezuelan menRead moreThose concerns were reflected in theVaticanstatement, which said the talks were cordial and that the Vatican expressed satisfaction with the administration’s commitment to protecting freedom of religion and conscience.“There was an exchange of opinions on the international situation, especially regarding countries affected by war, political tensions and difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners,” the statement said.“Finally, hope was expressed for serene collaboration between the state and the Catholic church in the United States, whose valuable service to the most vulnerable people was acknowledged.”The reference to “serene collaboration” appeared to refer to Vance’s accusation that the US conference of Catholic bishops was resettling “illegal immigrants” in order to obtain federal funding. Top US cardinals have pushed back strongly against the claim.Parolin told La Repubblica on the eve of Vance’s visit: “It is clear that the approach of the current US administration is very different from what we are used to and, especially in the west, from what we have relied on for many years,.”As the US pushes to end the war in Ukraine, Parolin reaffirmed Kyiv’s right to its territorial integrity and insisted that any peace deal must not be “imposed” on Ukraine but “built patiently, day by day, with dialogue and mutual respect”.Vance was spending Easter weekend in Rome with his family and attended Good Friday services in St Peter’s Basilica after meeting Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni. On Saturday, after the Vance family’s introduction to Parolin, they had a private tour of the Sistine Chapel.It was not immediately clear where they would celebrate Easter. Pope Francis, for his part, according to official liturgical plans released on Saturday, indicated he hoped to attend Easter mass on Sunday, which usually draws thousands to St Peter’s Square.The pope and Vance have tangled over immigration and the Trump administration’s plans to deport people en masse. Francis has made caring for those who migrate a hallmark of his papacy and his progressive views on social justice issues have often put him at odds with members of the more conservative US Catholic church.The pope also changed church teaching to say that capital punishment was inadmissible in all cases. After a public appeal from Francis just weeks before Trump took office, Joe Biden commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row. Trump is an outspoken proponent of expanding capital punishment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They envision a counter-revolution in which they take over government bureaucracy and institutions such as universities from within, replacing entrenched “elites” with their own and acting upon their vision of the “common good”.Just days before the pope was admitted to hospital in February, Francis criticised the Trump administration’s deportation plans, warning that they would deprive people of their inherent dignity. In a letter to US bishops, he also appeared to respond to Vance directly for having claimed that Catholic doctrine justified such policies.Vance had defended the administration’s America-first crackdown by citing a concept from medieval Catholic theology known in Latin asordo amoris. He said the concept delineated a hierarchy of care – to family first, followed by neighbour, community, fellow citizens and, last, those elsewhere.In his 10 February letter, Francis appeared to correct Vance’s understanding of the concept.“Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extends to other persons and groups,” he wrote. “The trueordo amoristhat must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the good Samaritan, that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.”Vance has acknowledged Francis’ criticism but has said he will continue to defend his views. During an appearance on 28 February at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington, Vance did not address the issue specifically but called himself a “baby Catholic” and acknowledged there are “things about the faith that I don’t know”.Explore more on these topicsVaticanPope FrancisJD VanceUS immigrationUkraineCatholicismChristianitynewsShareReuse this content"

It was a warm spring day. “I thought I’d sit with friends, have some tea. Birds were singing. The weather was beautiful. It was so nice,” she recalled.“The bus was packed. There wasn’t a single free seat. People were standing. Some were going to church for Palm Sunday. There were families with children.”As she reached the city centre she heard a loud bang. Two minutes later – as the bus made its way down Petropavlivska street – there was a second massive explosion. “The blast was in front of me, so I didn’t see it. I only heard it. I was sitting behind the driver, with my back to him. When I heard the noise, I covered my head with my hands and ducked.”After that, she said, “rocks, glass and everything went flying”. Shyrshonkova lifted her head. Blood was gushing “like a fountain” from her arm. “I saw cars on fire and smoke. People were lying at my feet. I said to them: ‘Get up, get up.’ They were silent.”A conductor called the name of the driver – “Kolya” – but there was no reply. Passengers tried to climb out of a window. Eventually, a teenage boy opened a door and she staggered out.View image in fullscreenMourners gather during the farewell ceremony for victims of the Palm Sunday attack.Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/APThe double strike on Sumy was thebloodiest single moment this year in Russia’s murderous war against Ukraine. The Iskander ballistic missiles carried deadly cluster of munitions which released a wave of shrapnel. Thirty-five people were killed.Two of the victims buried last week were children, aged eleven and seven. Sumy residents left toys at the spot where they perished: a bear, a hippo, a toy car and a football.Shyrshonkova was one of 129 people wounded. Among them are 15 children. Some are critically injured, hovering “between life and death”, as Tetyana, a nurse at Sumy’s general hospital, told theObserver. The first missile crashed into a university congress centre, plunging through a glass atrium and a basement theatre. The second turned the city into a vision of hell, with bodies on the ground and a little girl crying and covered in blood.The war seems further away than ever from a peaceful resolution. On Friday, Donald Trumpsignalled he is ready to “take a pass”on brokering an agreement unless the two sides reach a deal “very shortly”.More than a month ago, Ukraine accepted a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire. Russia didn’t. Since then, it has demonstratively escalated its bombing campaign on civilians and infrastructure,hitting Sumy, Kharkiv and Dnipro.mapAs many predicted, Trump’s negotiating strategy has been to favourRussia. He has effectively ended military assistance to Kyiv, while falsely blaming Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Joe Biden for “starting” the war.No similar pressure has been applied to Moscow. Trump downplayed last weekend’s Sumy strike, calling it a “mistake”. His special envoy, Steve Witkoff – whomet European leaders on Thursday– parrots Kremlin disinformation.Speaking from hospital, survivors expressed anger at the US president, accusing him of laziness and a bewildering partisanship. “What happened in Sumy is terror, obviously – nothing else,” Shyrshonkova said. “Trump is basically supporting Russia now.“I wish he would come toUkraineand see what his belovedpuylo[a slang term for Putin, meaning prick] is doing. I want Trump to help us at the same level as Joe Biden.”Another wounded survivor, 72-year-old Hennadii Smoliarov, said the Russians were carrying out genocide. “They are trying to destroy all Ukrainians. They hate us. Putin says we are not a people.“They promote the concept ofRusskiy Miror ‘Russian World’. That means conquering everywhere.”Smoliarov said that, when he was studying in Moscow in the 1980s, he was called aKhokhol, a derogatory term for Ukrainians.“Prejudice is widespread,” he noted.He had been sitting on the 62 bus, having gone into town to fetch eyedrops for his wife, Anna. After the first strike the bus stopped outside Sumy state university’s institute of applied physics. Shrapnel from the second missile hit his lung and head. “There was a strong shockwave. You couldn’t see inside. The smoke was like a fog, it was so thick.”A woman lay motionless at his feet. “I lost strength and collapsed right inside the bus,” he recalled.View image in fullscreenHennadii Smoliarov, a survivor of the Sumy rocket attack, says Russia is ‘trying to destroy all Ukrainians’.Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The ObserverA volunteer grabbed Smoliarov by the collar of his brown leather jacket and dragged him on to the pavement.The explosion blew the wooden doors and glass from the 19th-century institute, sending shards into its garden and flowerbeds. A quartz wall clock on the ground floor stopped at the moment of impact: 10.20am and 40 seconds. Across the road, a giant hole was gouged in the white-painted economics and business faculty building.Another wounded survivor, Viktor Voitenko, said Sumy was in its fourth year of war. “We’ve had so many attacks, withShahed drones and missiles,” he said. “The air raids don’t stop.”The city, a key military hub, is located less than 20 miles from Russia. From here, Ukraine’s armed forces launcheda surprise mini-invasionlast August into Russia’s neighbouring Kursk region. Theywithdrew in March. Fighting continues in villages along the border, where Ukrainian troops hold a sliver of Russian territory.Voitenko works at the physics institute as a security guard. He was in the foyer when the second Iskander dropped. A metal fragment hit him in the spine. “I couldn’t feel my legs. I called my wife and she reached me in five minutes. After that, the police took me to a safe place,” he said.Lying in a hospital bed, Voitenko said it was unclear if he would walk again: “It’s in God’s hands. My operation went well. The doctors say they can’t guarantee anything.”Aged 56, Voitenko previously worked as a builder and as a “liquidator” – a member of the clean-up crew sent to the Chornobyl nuclear power station after the 1986 disaster.The Kremlin, he said, was addicted to reckless imperialism. “Before the war, we lived well. We had everything. I have a beautiful wife, an 11-year-old daughter and two cars.”The bus driver, Mykola Leon – killed on Palm Sunday, together with most of his passengers – was a distant relative, he said.‘It’s sheer terrorism’: Sumy buries dead after Russia’s Palm Sunday attackRead moreShyrshonkova spoke to theObserverfrom the neighbouring hospital room.

Premier League matches accounted for 20% (15.8 million) of all sports attendances.Ilie Oleart, from Barcelona, founded LMI, which has covered football matches in England for Spanish-speaking fans around the world since 2011. The channel has attracted nearly half a million subscribers, and in 2018 began offering trips to the UK so fans could experience the English game.Oleart, who supports the Catalan club Espanyol, who play in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football, said he aspired to not only arrange trips but to be involved in a club in a more meaningful way.“Our aim was to transform a small local English club into a small local club with a global fanbase,” he said.Harborough Town FC,nicknamed the Bees, emerged as the fans’ choice after Oleart consulted his subscriber base. LMI has brought its subscribers along to watch matches at the grounds of Brighton and Hove Albion, Sheffield United and Wycombe Wanderers.“I met people at the club in September to get to know their history, the town and the facilities,” said Oleart. “We thought they were the perfect club with the right values to share with our audience.”Football matches at Harborough Town, which take place in the Southern League Premier Division Central , will now feature live on the LMIYouTubechannel, allowing Spanish speakers an opportunity to become “virtual supporters” of the club.The Bees chair, Peter Dougan, said the partnership with LMI was an “opportunity to grow our fanbase and our income” through a global audience and could open the door to sponsorship deals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ballot papers, being sent out this week, ask a simple question: “Do you supportUkrainebecoming a member of the EU?”Despite the neutral question, Hungary’s government is not standing on the sidelines. After the launch of the campaign, the prime minister,Viktor Orbán, last week urged people to vote, claiming that Ukrainian membership would mean “we would have to spend all Hungary’s money on Ukraine”.The government has also claimed – without offering evidence – that “cheap labour” from Ukraine would take jobs from Hungarians, while epidemics would spread because not enough Ukrainians get vaccinations.The governing Fidesz party realised that “there is a sentiment against Hungary’s involvement in the war”, said László Andor, Hungary’s EU commissioner from 2010 to 2014. “But ever since, this has been used and abused to deny proper support to Ukraine.”Hungary has repeatedly sought toblock EU sanctions against Russia, eventually backing down. It has vetoed the release of €6bn funds to reimburse other EU countries providing military aid to Ukraine and flatly refused to sign two EU declarations in support of its invaded neighbour.But now its attempts to stymie EU support for Ukraine could force a reckoning in its relations with the bloc at a moment when Orbán contends with his most serious political challenger in years.EU member states are considering more seriously than ever how to use their ultimate sanction against Hungary: the removal of voting rights under theEU treaty’s article 7.The idea remains at an early stage, but informed insiders think it will never happen because rescinding voting rights requires the unanimity of the remaining 26 members.Under a previous government, Poland wielded the saviour veto; now Slovakia’s populist prime minister,Robert Fico, is seen as holding that card. The European parliamentlaunched the article 7 procedure in 2018, but it has languished amid hesitancy among member states.Now there are flickers of change. Andor said things had moved on since the Orbán government’s first “very consequential violations” against the independence of the judiciary emerged in 2010-11. “There are many more emotions [now]. Why? Because Orbán is obstructive on issues which the majority of theEuropean Unioncountries consider of vital importance,” he said, referring to Ukraine.Some think a reckoning will come if Hungary seeks to veto the extension of sanctions againstRussia, a vast array of measures aimed at curtailing the war economy, including the freezing of €210bn of Russian central bank assets held in the bloc.The profits are being used tofund Ukraine’s war effort, while the capital is seenas vital for its eventual reconstruction. But the measures need to be renewed unanimously by 31 July.“I am pretty sure that if they felt they had the backing of the US, they would block,” said one senior EU official.“It would be huge: basically, it would put them not literally but virtually outside the union.”Diplomats have taken comfort from the fact that Hungary has always backed down on threats to veto, possibly discouraged when Donald Trump alsothreatened Vladimir Putin with sanctions. “If the past is predictive for the future, we should be OK. But it would be foolish to assume that,” said one senior diplomat, who added that “work is going on” to find ways around a potential veto.Dutch Green MEP Tineke Strik, who leads the European parliament’s work on Hungary and the rule of law, said: “Member states really are getting fed up with Orbán.” She counts 19 governments “that seem to be ready to take a step in the article 7 procedure”, which includes action that falls short of suspending voting rights. But they lack “a strategy on how to get the rest of the member states on board”, she added.Last week, the Dutch MEP led a cross-party team of parliamentarians to investigate democratic standards in Hungary, concluding that developments were“going rapidly in the wrong direction”.Pressure onindependent voices is intensifying. In a speech last month, widely seen as marking a new low, Orbán described political opponents, journalists, judges and political activists as “bugs”, redolent of the dehumanising language used in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.View image in fullscreenProtesters in Budapest march against the Hungarian government’s Pride ban last weekPhotograph: Balint Szentgallay/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockA report by the MEPs is expected to elaborate on Hungary’s deep-rooted problems: government-dominated media and politicised courts, as well as increasing restrictions on the LGBTQ+ community after the approval of a constitutional change to codify theban on Pride marches and other public gatherings.“Everyone is fearing this stands for something bigger – the free right to assembly,” Strik said.For analysts, the Pride ban has a different purpose: to wrongfootopposition leader Péter Magyar, the insider turned critic whose Tisza party has extended its lead on Fidesz since the start of the year.“In strategic terms, [the Pride ban] is a trap set for Péter Magyar,” said Daniel Hegedüs, regional director for central Europe at the German Marshall fund.If Magyar condemns the Pride ban, Fidesz will criticise him as part of the “European gay lobby”, which could alienate him from conservative voters, said Hegedüs, using the government’s own language. “But if he stays silent, he risks alienating the more educated, more urban voters for whom it’s a question of values commitment.”In a similar way, the government is also seeking to use the Ukraine referendum to discredit Magyar among voters who are wary of Hungary being drawn into the conflict. His Tisza party is described by government propaganda as “pro-Ukrainian”, working with Brussels to “undermine the living standards of Hungarians”.View image in fullscreenPéter Magyar, leader of the Hungarian opposition party Tisza, is seen as a serious challenger to prime minister Viktor Orbán.Photograph: Bernadett Szabó/ReutersTisza, Hegedüs said, is such “an existential threat” to Fidesz that Orbán could resort to electoral fraud to secure victory in parliamentary elections next year.While the last three Hungarian parliamentary elections have been rated unfair – due to media and state resources tilted to favour the government – they have always been free.Orbán problem pushes EU towards ‘coalitions of the willing’ on UkraineRead more“We cannot excludethe first neither free, nor fair election in an EU member state[and] a situation where the US administration will immediately recognise the outcome,” Hegedüs said.This raises a challenge for EU diplomats, who have long argued the best way to solve the “Orbán problem” – likethe “Poland problem”before it – is to wait for change at the ballot box.Strik thinks it is the wrong approach. The Dutch MEP wants the commission to speak out more, seek a European court suspension order on the ban of LGBTQ+ events, and redistribute Hungary’s forfeited EU funds to civil society and local government: the Hungarian government lost €1bn in EU funds in 2024 over rule-of-law noncompliance, while a further €19bn is blocked.“He [Orbán] should be under huge pressure from the EU to change his course,” said Strik.Explore more on these topicsHungaryThe ObserverViktor OrbánEuropeEuropean UnionEuropean CommissionUrsula von der LeyenVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

Just over two weeks later, itresumed large-scale bombingand redeployed ground troops withdrawn during the truce.Since then, political figures and security officials have repeatedly vowed that aid deliveries will not resume until Hamas releases the remaining hostages seized during the7 October 2023 attacksthat ignited the conflict. Israel’s government has framed the new siege as a security measure and has repeatedly denied using starvation as a weapon, which would constitutea war crime.The blockade is now entering its eighth week, making it the longest continuous total siege the strip has faced to date in the 18-month war.Firmly supported by the US, its most important ally under Donald Trump, Israel appears confident that it can maintain the siege with little international pushback.‘Keeping people alive’: Gaza’s last working bakery forced by Israel to keep on movingRead moreIt is also moving ahead with large-scale seizures of Palestinian land for security buffer zones, and plans to shift control of aid delivery to the army and private contractors, exacerbating fears inGazathat Israel intends to maintain boots on the ground in the territory long-term and permanently displace its residents.Many people theObserverspoke tosaid they are now more afraid of famine than airstrikes. “Many times, I have had to give up my share of food for my son because of the severe shortages. It is the hunger that will kill me – a slow death,” said Hikmat al-Masri, a 44-year-old university lecturer from Beit Lahia in north Gaza.Food stockpiled during the two-month-ceasefire has run out, and desperate people across the territory are jostling at charity kitchens with empty pots and bowls. Goods at markets are now selling for 1,400% above ceasefire prices, according to the latest assessment from the World Health Organization.An estimated 420,000 people are on the move again because of new Israeli evacuation orders, making it difficult to compile hard data on hunger and malnutrition, but Oxfam estimates that most children are now surviving on less than one meal a day.About 95% of aid organisations have suspended or cut back services because of airstrikes and the blockade, and since February, Israel hastightened restrictionsfor international staff to enter Gaza. Basic medical supplies – even painkillers – are running out.“Gaza City is packed with displaced people who have fled Israeli troops moving into the north, and they are living on the street or putting their tents inside damaged buildings that are going to collapse,” said Amande Bazerolle, the Gaza emergency coordinator for Médecins Sans Frontières, speaking from Deir al-Balah.Bazerolle added: “There are not enough points of care for so many people. At our burns clinic in Gaza City, we are refusing patients by 10am and we have to tell them to come back the next day, as we are triaging to make our drug supplies last as long as possible.”The siege has been accompanied by a fierce push by Israeli forces on northern Gaza as well as the entirety of Rafah, the strip’s southernmost city, cutting the territory off from Egypt.According to the UN, approximately 70% of Gaza is now under Israeli evacuation orders or has been subsumed intoexpanding military buffer zones; the new Rafah security zone totals one-fifth of the entire territory.The land seizures are pushing the 2.3 million population – and aid and medical efforts – into ever-smaller Israeli-designated “humanitarian zones”, although anIsraeli airstrike last week on al-Mawasi, the biggest such zone on the coast of southern Gaza, killed 16 people.View image in fullscreenPeople survey the destruction in the aftermath of an Israeli military strike on al-Ahli hospital in the Gaza Strip in April 2025.Photograph: APAImages/REX/ShutterstockAs the space they can operate in shrinks, aid workers said they are worried that that the rules of engagement followed by the Israeli military have changed since the ceasefire collapsed, pointing to the recentbombings of Nasser hospitalin Khan Younis andal-Ahli hospitalin Gaza City.Two people were killed in the Nasser attack, which hit a building where members of an international medical team were present. No casualties were reported in the al-Ahli strike, but the intensive care and surgery departments of the hospital were destroyed, medics said. In both cases, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had targeted Hamas militants.“People in Gaza like having international staff around because they assume it affords them more protection and the IDF is less likely to attack the building or the area,” said a senior aid official, who asked not to be named so as to speak freely.“In the beginning of the war, if there was an airstrike two kilometres away from our location, we would evacuate… eventually, that became 300 metres, and now it’s 30 metres, if [the IDF] hits the building next door.“There are either no warnings, or sometimes 20 minutes, which is not enough time to evacuate sick people. Our exposure to risk is getting higher... We know the Israelis are trying to force us to work under their terms.”In a statement in response to the aid worker’s allegations, the IDF said: “Hamas has a documented practice of operating within densely populated areas. Strikes on military targets are subject to relevant provisions of international law, including taking feasible precautions.” It referred questions about aid to the political echelon.Israel has long alleged that Hamas siphons off large amounts of the aid that has reached Gaza, allowing the group to maintain its control by either keeping the aid for itself or selling it at marked-up prices to desperate civilians.View image in fullscreenIsraeli media reported last week that private contractors may be used to distribute humanitarian aid in Gaza.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/APLast week, Israeli media reported that efforts to sidestep international agencies and create an Israeli-controlled mechanism to distribute aidusing private contractorsare under way but still in the “early stages”, with no timeframe for implementation. In the interim, the humanitarian crisis will only worsen, aid agencies say.International mediators are attempting to revive ceasefire talks, but there is little sign either side has moved closer on fundamental issues such as the disarmament of Hamas and the withdrawal of Israeli troops.Masri, the lecturer from Beit Lahia, said: “When the blockade was imposed again and the war resumed, I felt terrified. I constantly think about my little son, and how I can provide him with basic necessities.“No one can imagine the level of suffering… Death surrounds us from every direction.”Explore more on these topicsGazaThe ObserverPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warHuman rightsAidnewsShareReuse this content"

The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said this week he was “neither overly optimistic nor pessimistic”.Iran expected to resist US plan to move uranium stockpile to third countryRead moreThe talks take place under the shadow of Donald Trump’s threat to attack Iran if it does not reach a deal with the US over its nuclear programme.The US president told reporters on Friday: “I’m for stoppingIran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon. They can’t have a nuclear weapon. I want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific.”Trump, who ditched a 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and six powers during his first term in 2018 and reimposed crippling sanctions on Tehran, has revived his “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran since returning to the White House in January.Washington wants Iran to halt production of highly enriched uranium, which it believes is aimed at building an atomic bomb.Tehran, which has always said its nuclear programme is peaceful, says it is willing to negotiate some curbs in return for the lifting of sanctions, but wants watertight guarantees that Washington will not renege again as Trump did in 2018.Araghchi said Iran’s right to enrich uranium was “non-negotiable”, afterWitkoff called for its complete halt.Since 2019, Iran has breached and far surpassed the 2015 deal’s limits on its uranium enrichment, producing stocks far above what the west says is necessary for a civilian energy programme.In an interview published on Wednesday by French newspaper Le Monde, the UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, said Iran was “not far” from possessing a nuclear bomb.Grossi, who held talks with Iranian officials during a visit to Tehran this week, said the US and Iran were “at a very crucial stage” in the talks and “don’t have much time” to secure a deal.Explore more on these topicsIranIran's nuclear programmeMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpNuclear weaponsnewsShareReuse this content"

They’re wrong: it will secure all our futuresToby HelmPolitical editorSat 19 Apr 2025 14.05 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Apr 2025 18.54 EDTShareEd Miliband has torn into Nigel Farage and the Tories for peddling dangerous “nonsense and lies” by suggesting the UK’s net zero target is responsible for destroying Britain’s businesses,including its steel industry.Cabinet ministers are determined to fight back against the way Reform UK and theConservativeshave unceremoniously lambasted the climate crisis agenda for what they believe are nakedly political reasons before important local elections next month.Both Farage and the Tories have blamed the perilous situation atBritish Steel’s Scunthorpe planton high energy costs, saying renewable energy prices have put the company on the brink.Reform has also used the crisis to call for the UK to become self-sufficient in oil and gas by drilling more in the North Sea, despite the fact that stocks there are dwindling fast and most of what is produced is exported.The total abandonment of the broad political consensus for net zero by parties on the right of UK politics – and by US president Donald Trump’s Republican administration in Washington – is causing serious alarm inside the UK government.Nigel Farage says Reform UK is ‘parking its tanks’ on Labour’s lawnRead moreBritain’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, is expected to “double down” on hisLabourgovernment’s commitment to a green energy future, and making the UK a clean energy superpower, at an International Energy Agency conference this week in London that will also be attended by pro-fossil-fuel officials from the Trump administration.In an article for theObserver, Miliband, the energy secretary, says the argument for the UK delivering clean power by 2030 is the same as it was when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022: the need to free ourselves from dependency on foreign supplies, including from Russia, which can lead to uncontrolled price spikes for customers in Britain.Referring to the soaring prices that shocked UK consumers in 2022 and that have continued to reverberate, he says: “Our exposure to fossil fuels meant that, as those markets went into meltdown and prices rocketed, family, business and public finances were devastated. The cost of living impacts caused back then still stalk families today.”As a result, Miliband says breaking free of dependence on overseas supplies is also a matter of “national security”.With an eye on thelocal and mayoral elections in England on 1 Mayin which Reform hopes to turn its recent national poll leads into council seats, Miliband says Farage’s party and the Tories “make up any old nonsense and lies to pursue their ideological agenda”.Polling experts believe the attacks on net zero could backfire on Reform and the Tories because the policy is overwhelmingly supported by the public.View image in fullscreenLuke Tryl, UK director of pollster More in Common, said Reform UK’s approach to the climate crisis could the party’s achilles heel.Photograph: SchoolsWeek websiteWhile Miliband has also been disparaged by the rightwing media over net zero, he is determined to fight back, not least because internal polling shows he and his policies remain popular within the Labour party.Luke Tryl, UK director of polling organisation More in Common, said: “There’s no doubt Reform have channelled public discontent with the status quo and a desire for change into electoral momentum since last July.“But their approach to climate change, along with stances on Ukraine and Farage’s relationship with Trump, risk becoming an achilles heel. Our research finds that in every UK constituency voters say they are more worried about climate change than not, and most see renewable energy as the path to energy security, jobs and cheaper energy.“Even Reform voters themselves, despite being less enamoured by the idea of net zero, just aren’t that motivated by it, and certainly not compared to an issue like immigration.”A Labour source said: “We will go after [Kemi] Badenoch and Farage on energy. They want to leave the UK exposed to markets controlled by [Vladimir] Putin – we are going to make the hard-nosed national security case for climate action.”View image in fullscreenReform UK leader Nigel Farage’s rhetoric that he party would reindustrialise Britain has been dismissed a ‘pure fantasy’ by climate groups.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAThis week Farage will tour 10 counties in England promoting his anti-net zero policy and also touting his newfound support for the outright nationalisation of the British steel industry – normally an approach advocated by politicians on the left.Miliband adds in hisObservercolumn that if the anti-net zero agenda were followed, it would not only risk “climate breakdown” but also “forfeit the clean energy jobs of the future” in this country, and with them a great opportunity for economic renewal.At a rally in Durham last week Farage said Reform would “reindustrialise Britain”, adding that this would require the country to start producing “enough of our own gas and oil and coal”. He said: “We should be self-sufficient in oil... We should be absolutely self-sufficient in gas.”Climate groups have, however, criticised this rhetoric as “pure fantasy”, pointing to official projections that show a steep decline in North Sea production, regardless of government policy and intervention, owing to the ageing nature of the sea’s basin.Far from being self-sufficient in gas, official forecasts show that the UK will be 94% reliant on gas imports by 2050 even if new fields were to be developed, only a fraction lower than if no new fields are developed (97% dependency).Labour has been making its own case for energy independence, focusing on Great BritishEnergy(GBE), which sources note is one of its most popular policies. The party will campaign heavily in the coming months on GBE’s policy of putting solar panels on the roofs of 200 schools and 200 hospitals.Tessa Khan, executive director of climate action group Uplift, said: “Nigel Farage is peddling a dangerous fantasy by suggesting that the UK can secure its energy from North Sea oil and gas.“As usual, he’s imitating Trump and his obsession with more drilling while ignoring that the UK’s remaining oil and gas reserves are dwindling fast after 60 years of extraction. That’s down to geology, not policies.”Khan added: “By trying to slow the shift to renewable energy, which the UK has in abundance but which Reform is opposed to, Farage is endangering the creation of new jobs that provide a more secure, long-term future.“The question for Reform is: what is its plan for the UK’s oil and gas workers, other than this dangerous fantasy?”Most of what is left in the North Sea is oil, about 80% of which is exported. The sea is also a high-cost basin to drill and more production is only possible if oil and gas prices are so high that energy bills become unaffordable for most ordinary people, or with more generous tax breaks for developers.Explore more on these topicsRenewable energyThe ObserverEnergyEd MilibandNigel FarageReform UKLabourConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

Thousands of trans and non-binary people thronged Parliament Square, alongside families and supporters waving baby blue, white and pink flags to demonstrate their anger at the judges’ ruling.The numbers seemed to take the organisers and police by surprise. Protesters from a hastily assembled coalition of 24 groups gathered in a ring against the barriers surrounding the grass and began speeches. But after the roads became clogged with people, a woman wearing a “Nobody knows I’m a lesbian” top ran across with her dog and soon the square was full. “It’s one hell of a turnout and there is a really strong sense of unity and solidarity,” said Jamie Strudwick, one of the organisers. “I think it’s impossible to compare it – it’s like nothing I’ve ever seen before.”Last Wednesday,the supreme court ruledthat when the Equality Act 2010 referred to women, it referred only to biological sex and did not include transgender women who hold a gender recognition certificate (GRC).The judgment was celebrated by groups including For Women Scotland, a gender-critical campaign groupbacked by JK Rowling, which says that women’s safety is threatened by allowing transgender women into single-sex spaces.In his judgment, Lord Hodge said that trans people were still protected from discrimination and harassment under the Equality Act. But some trans people say they have felt confusion, fear and anger, with many believing they will find it harder to challenge unfair treatment and receive support from authorities that should be helping them.View image in fullscreenMany protesters felt encouraged by the show of solidarity.Photograph: The ObserverAfter the ruling, the Equality and Human Rights Commission chair,Kishwer Falkner, said that it would create a new statutory code of practice by the summer, giving guidance to public bodies on how they should change their treatment of women and trans people. She said the NHS would need to change itsrules on single-sex wardsand her organisation would pursue the matter if it did not.Other organisations have already acted. British Transport Police said same-sex searches in custody would be conducted “in accordance with the biological birth sex of the detainee”.“In the last week, I’ve had to respond to four suicide attempts or threats from young people,” said Oscar Hoyle, who founded the Blossom LGBT community interest group in 2018. “The most significant one, I was on the phone for three hours to a transgender girl, 18 years old. It took three hours for police to come.” Blossom works with about 400 16 to 30-year-olds from across the LGBTQ community to support them into adulthood, and about two-thirds identify as trans or non-binary.“Regardless of where you sit in this conversation, nobody should be in a position where they feel like life isn’t worth living just because they fall within a marginalised group,” Hoyle said.Among the crowds outside parliament were Awsten Atkinson, a 23-year-old trans man and their partner, Daisy Watt, a 19-year-old trans woman. “My first reaction to the ruling was absolute horror,” Watt said. “I remember looking at the news and thinking, how on earth have we fallen this far? Not even 10 years ago we were making incredible progress but we just seemed to backslide so severely.”View image in fullscreenAwsten Atkinson, left, and Daisy Watt expressed horror and disbelief at the ruling.Photograph: Sonja Horsman/The ObserverAtkinson was “devastated and in disbelief”: “Why do people care so much about what we do with our lives when it doesn’t actually affect them? This is being framed as a feminist movement but the criteria they’re using to decide who is a woman brings the focus back to women as objects, as the sum of their body parts.”The couple were appalled by the BTP decision. “There are a lot of British transport police under investigation for sexual harassment as it is and this opens up the opportunity for them to say ‘you’re getting searched by a male because I believe you’re trans’ and they’re protected by law to do that,” Atkinson said.With protesters on the green, mostly under 30, waving flags and banners, Watt was “reassured that we have a community around us that is willing to stand up and speak truth to power”. Atkinson added: “As we were coming along, I started smiling and I said to them [Watt and her friends] ‘wow look at everybody’. What you can count on in this community is that people will rally round.”Near Mahatma Gandhi’s statue, two trans women in their 20s said they were worried that the UK was becoming more like the US.“When they instituted the bathroom bans there, you saw that it wasn’t just trans people, it was also cis people getting accused and being forced out,” one said.View image in fullscreenThe protest was hastily organised by 24 organisations.Photograph: The ObserverThe other said: “What I see is trans misogyny that women legally can’t be women, whereas men will always be men. I find it very scary.“In public spaces I have a different vibe. It’s like we’re going back in time. It feels like we’re not protected by the law any more.”Ann-Marie Still was there with her sister and niece. When she heard the news she was angry and disappointed in the system, she said. “I immediately reached out to trans friends, family, with a simple message: ‘you are loved, you are valid’.”“Most people disregard the young,” said Dani, who was there representing her trans sister. “Parents, children, elderly people – they can’t live their lives as they actually want to.”Police later launched an investigation after seven statues were daubed with graffiti, among them that of the suffragette Millicent Fawcett. Scotland Yard said its officers were in Parliament Square at the time, but did not witness the “criminal damage” take place. No arrests had been made, but officers were investigating, said Ch Supt Stuart Bell, leading the protest policing operation.Supreme court ruling on sex divides opinion | LettersRead morePolack said it would not change how she behaved. “I can go for an exercise and I go into the changing rooms and there’s nothing to hide because I look like every other woman that’s there.“There are one or two people I come across there who know my past and they’re quite happy with it and the rest of them don’t know and can’t tell. Why should it change? There’s no reason for it to change.”One of the things that bothers Polack is whether the ruling makes her gender recognition certificate valid or not. “There will probably be an attempt to restrict access to changing rooms and what they call single-sex spaces and enforce some sort of ban, but how do you police that?”Explore more on these topicsTransgenderThe ObserverGenderUK supreme courtEquality Act 2010LondonProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

The first bit of footage praising the taste of the expensive so-called “Dubai chocolate” was posted at the end of 2023 and has now been viewed more than 120m times, to say nothing of the many follow-up videos.The result has been an international shortage of the vital ingredient, pistachio ­kernels, which are largely grown in either the US or Iran. In a year, prices have surged from $7.65 to $10.30 a pound, Giles Hacking, from nut trader CG Hacking,told theFinancial Times.The nut was already becoming scarce due to last year’s poor harvest in the US, the world’s leading exporter. Although that crop was smaller than usual, it was of higher quality and so was largely sold as whole nuts, still in their shells. This has created a further shortage of the basic kernels used in the chocolate bars.Iranian producers, meanwhile, had exported 40% more nuts to the UAE in the six months to March than they had in the 12 months prior to that.Everyone has gone nuts for pistachios. But they’re just an upmarket green peanut, aren’t they? | Emma BrockesRead moreDubai chocolate mania can be sourced to the creation of a bar that combined milk chocolate, the shredded pastry known askataifi, and a pistachio cream filling. Made by the swish Emirati chocolatier Fix, which only sells in the UAE, it was prophetically given the punning name Can’t Get Knafeh of It, in reference to a traditional Arab dessert.Other leading chocolate makers, such as Läderach and Lindt, quickly created their own pistachio ­chocolate products, but are now struggling to meet international demand. Charles Jandreau, the general manager for Prestat Group, which owns several luxury British chocolate brands, told theFTthat the demand for the bars has surprised the industry. “It feels like it came out of nowhere,” he said. “Suddenly you see it in every corner shop.”Some stores are reportedly rationing the number of bars sold at one time. Testament, then, either to the power of TikTok influencers, or the rather more established appeal of tasty chocolate.Explore more on these topicsChocolateThe ObserverNuts and seedsTikTokFoodSocial mediaInternational tradeDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

We know what this means. It means restructures, it means redundancies, memberslosing their jobsand children losing their teachers.”Patrick Roach, the NASUWT’s general secretary, said: “We know that the government has been handed the pay review body’s latest report and we hope that the pay review body has been ambitious in putting forward recommendations that will address the ongoingrecruitment and retention crisis.”If the spending review fails to top up school budgets, the two unions are likely to hold formal strike ballots among their members in the summer, setting the scene for potential school closures in the autumn.In a video address to the NASUWT conference on Saturday, Phillipson told delegates: “The toughest financial inheritance in a generation has meant that we’ve already had to take some incredibly difficult decisions, and I’m afraid that more are still coming.”The NASUWT scrapped a planned announcement about Roach’s replacement as general secretary, after he announced in October that he would be stepping down.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No steam locomotive in the world had ever been run with in-cab digital signalling – until now.On a Monday night earlier this month, the new technology was ­trialled for the first time as part of a “pathfinder” project aimed at ­securing the future of steam locomotives in the UK.The “A1” No.60163 Tornado –Britain’s first steam locomotive to be built in 50 yearsand which has appeared in thePaddington 2movie and onTop Gear– has been ­fitted with European Train Control System (ETCS) technology as part of a Network Rail-led initiative which was launched in 2021. Fitting the new technology cost about £9m.View image in fullscreenThe Tornado crosses the Ribblehead viaduct in the Yorkshire Dales.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAETCS is to be rolled out across the country in the coming years and some trains will run in digital-only mode from the end of this year.It is already widely used in Europe and is seen as the industry standard ­signalling system for high-speed lines. Since 2011, the Cambrian Coast Line has been operated exclusively using the system as part of a different pilot programme.The Tornado ran west of Shrewsbury to Newtown and Welshpool overnight to trial the technology for the first time.“It is existential to the sector if steam cannot run with ETCS … the team have done a brilliant job of ­getting us to this point,” a Network Rail spokesperson involved in the project told theObserver. “The pathfinder [project] is all about saying ‘this is going to be really hard, is it ­technically viable?’ Nobody has ever done it with a heritage vehicle.”Since the privatisation of the railways, steam trains have been free to roam the national network subject to there being “white space” in the ­timetables around service trains.“We had quite a few challenges fitting the systems,” Rob Morland, electrical engineer at The A1 Steam Locomotive Trust, Tornado’s ­owning group, told theObserver. “This is a very harsh environment: we’ve got heat, coal, coal dust, shocks and vibrations and they all stress the systems.”A second steam-powered turbo generator, an axle-driven alternator and a dedicated battery bank had to be installed in order to power the equipment: “The cab was stripped back to bare metal because of the sheer number of new conduits, boxes and equipment and that was the only practical way to do it,” Morland added.Amy Clouston, principal human factors specialist at engineering consultancy AtkinsRéalis, which designed the fitment of the systems, said: “We had to test whether or not you can even use a touchscreen while you’re hurtling along at up to 75mph. We’ve had to think about vibrations, lighting, noise, coal dust, water and steam and grubby fingers.”Clouston said her team also had to factor in the placement of the screens to avoid being hit by a fireman ­swinging a shovel around, while still being in a position where the driver can still see the safety-critical ­information displayed.“Drivers have varied positions: some drivers hang out of the cab, ­others stand. It isn’t a ‘I’m sat at a desk’ design of a modern diesel or electric locomotive,” she said.Keeping the computers powering the systems cool also proved to be a headache: “The design team had the challenge of sealing them [against] coal dust and heat. Electronics in a sealed environment that’s already hot does not bode well [for the longevity],” she added.“Tornado’s retrofit with our ETCS is a world-first project that has tested our technology in one of the most complex and harsh ­operating environments, proving heritage and digital systems can coexist ­without compromise,” Tank Porteous, ­main line signalling programme director at Hitachi Rail UK, a partner in the project, said.Tornado is so far the only steam locomotive to have been fitted with the system. Last year Network Rail issued a £40m tender document for companies to bid to fit 24 main line steam and heritage diesel locomotives.“The price of future fitments will be significantly cheaper, there’s no doubt about that, but we don’t know yet exactly what that might be,” the NR spokesperson said.“We need to work out how ­commercially viable it is going to be. This is going to form part of where we go in the future.”The spokesperson told theObserverthe team have “learned more in the extremes with Tornado than we will do anywhere elsewhere” and the results will influence the design of equipment that will be fitted.AtkinsRéalis’s Clouston said the project was vital to the future of the main line steam sector: “Steam is part of the nation’s engineering ­heritage so it would be such a shame if it were to only be contained to ­private, ­heritage railways. Having steam ­locomotives out there on the main line is a ­wonderful thing to see.”Explore more on these topicsRail transportThe ObserverTransportEngineeringNetwork RailPaddington 2Top GearTravel & leisurenewsShareReuse this content"

Harsono, 33, was arrested four days after his visa was revoked without notice. He is scheduled for another hearing on 1 May.“His wife has been in a state of shock and exhaustion,” Sarah Gad, Harsono’s lawyer, said. “The Department of Homeland Security has weaponized the immigration system to serve just an entirely different purpose, which is to instill fear.”Harsono, a supply-chain manager at a hospital in Marshall,Minnesota, who is married to a US citizen, was surprised by authorities in his workplace basement on 27 March. Gad said that Harsono was detained without clear explanation and interrogated for hours.Harsono’s wife, Peyton, called Gad in a panic after she received a call from human resources at the hospital. Two Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents, dressed in plain clothes, had shown up and instructed the staff to stage a fake meeting in the basement so they could apprehend him, according to Gad.Hospital staff were distraught but felt forced to comply.“He unsuspectedly walks in, smiling, and then they just pull out their handcuffs and forcibly detain him, pushing against the wall, start frisking him, and stripping all of his belongings,” Gad said.View image in fullscreenAditya Wahyu Harsono (left) and Peyton Harsono, with their baby.Photograph: Peyton Harsono/GoFundMeThe Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the Guardian.Harsono was brought to the Kandiyohi County Jail, where he is still detained, according to theIce detainee locator.He told the Ice agents that his F-1 student visa was valid through June 2026, and that he had a pending green-card application based on his marriage to a citizen, but that he had been issued a notice to appear in court stating that he had overstayed his visa.His attorney said that as of 28 March, the day after his arrest, his F-1 visa was still active. Gad said the government revoked it without any notice to him, and then claimed he had overstayed.The revocation was backdated to 23 March and allegedly based on his 2022 misdemeanor conviction for graffitiing a semi-truck trailer. Gad said that this is not a deportable offense under the Immigration and Nationality Act. He had traveled internationally and returned multiple times to Indonesia since the conviction without incident.The day before Harsono’s bond hearing, DHS disclosed their evidence against him. Besides stating that his visa had been revoked for the misdemeanor graffiti conviction, for which he paid $100 in restitution, they also mentioned an arrest from 2021 during a protest over the murder of George Floyd. That charge was dismissed.Harsono is Muslim and frequently posts on social media in support of humanitarian relief for Gaza. He also runs a small non-profit, which sells art and merchandise, with proceeds going to organizations aiding Gaza.His wife and eight-month-old daughter, who has special needs, are distraught by his arrest, Gad said. After the judge granted Harsono a $5,000 bond on 10 April, the Minnesota Freedom Fund had been en route to pay it. But DHS immediately filed a notice to appeal the bond decision, which triggered an automatic stay, meaning Harsono had to remain in custody. Gad said this type of move is rare, usually only seen when a judge grants bond to someone charged with violent or serious crimes.“You never involve stays of an immigration judge’s bond order for a minor conviction when somebody’s on their way to becoming a green-card holder,” she said.Denied, detained, deported: the most high-profile cases in Trump’s immigration crackdownRead moreGad is preparing to file a federal petition and a temporary restraining order against DHS.Inan appeal for helpon GoFundMe, Harsono’s wife explained that her husband had been fired from his job while in detention and now the family is “in danger of losing our apartment” and they “no longer have health insurance”.The Minnesota Nurses Associationcondemnedthe hospital worker’s arrest and restated its position that “nurses should not and will not serve any role in immigration enforcement” and its hope that “all hospital employees will also reject a role in assisting Ice”.Harsono’s case comes amid a wave of reports ofstudent visas being revoked under the Trump administration’s new executive policy. The actions by the federal government to terminate students’ legal status have left hundreds of scholars at risk of detention and deportation.At least 901 students at 128 colleges and universities have had their visas revoked or their legal statuses terminated since mid-March, according to an Associated Press review of university statements and correspondence with school officials.In some high-profile cases, including the detention of the former Columbia University graduate studentMahmoud Khalil, the Trump administration has argued it should be allowed to deport noncitizens over involvement in pro-Palestinian activism it casts as antisemitic. But in the vast majority of visa revocations, colleges say there is no indication that affected students had a role in protests.Explore more on these topicsMinnesotaUS immigrationTrump administrationIndonesiaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Thank you, Oakland!”“I accept your choice with a deep sense of responsibility, humility, and love,” Lee added. “Oakland is a deeply divided City; I answered the call to run to unite our community, so that I can represent every voter, and we can all work together as One Oakland to solve our most pressing problems.”Lee must confront a series of acute challenges, including a gaping budget shortfall, widespread public safety concerns and an affordability crisis. She will serve out the remainder of the term of Sheng Thao, who was recalled by voters in November amid frustration over crime and homelessness.Earlier this year, Thao was indicted on federal bribery charges; she has denied wrongdoing.Barbara Lee forged a historic path in Congress. Does Oakland want her back for mayor?Read moreBoth Lee and Taylor – the leading contenders in a wide field of candidates – prioritized addressing public safety and the city’s financial crisis, but offered different visions.“Right now, we’re in a period of instability and voters are looking for somebody to stabilize the city government,” said Chris Higgenbotham, an Oakland-based political consultant who was not involved with the mayoral race.He added that residents had wanted the city’s next mayor to “move us not in just the right direction for the next two years but to put us on a road map back to where we were at before the pandemic – one of the best cities, highlighted in magazines, and not just in the news for the negative”.The 78-year-old former representative, a hometown hero, promised to move Oakland past the rancor that has clouded city hall over the last few years. Taylor had cast himself as a tough-on-crime moderate who would shake up city hall and “fix” a “broken” city.Though Lee entered as the heavy favorite, Taylor’s campaign gained momentum as outside groups working to push the Bay Area’s progressive politics to the center took an interest in his campaign.Lee was backed by most of the city council, the interim mayor, the local Democratic party, labor unions, faith leaders and business leaders. She earned the endorsement of the editorial board of the East Bay Times. Taylor drew support from the business and tech communities and was endorsed by the San Francisco Chronicle’s editorial board.Explore more on these topicsOaklandCaliforniaWest CoastUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Americans abroad also signaled their opposition to the Trump agenda inDublin, Ireland, and other cities.More than 400 rallies were planned, most loosely organized by the group50501, which stands for 50 protests in 50 states, one movement.Opponents of Donald Trump’s administration mobilized from the east coast to the west, including at rallies inPortland, Maine, andPortland, Oregon, decrying what they see as threats to the nation’s democratic ideals.The demonstrations includeda massive marchthrough midtown Manhattan, a rally in front of the White House, and protestersholding up placardsreading “It’s Our Turn to Fight Tyranny” and “The Fascists Are Coming, The Fascists Are Coming” at a Concord, Massachusetts, commemoration of the start of the American revolutionary war 250 years ago.View image in fullscreenThe National Day of Action rally in downtown Miami, Florida, on Saturday.Photograph: Cristóbal Herrera/EPAView image in fullscreenThe protest in Miami on Saturday.Photograph: Lynne Sladky/APIn Massachusetts, 80-year-old retired mason Thomas Bassfordtold CBS Newsthat he believed US citizens were under attack from their own government, saying: “This is a very perilous time in America for liberty. Sometimes we have to fight for freedom.”Protesters identified a variety of concerns, each unified under a common theme: opposition to the second Trump presidency.“We are losing our country,” demonstrator Sara Harvey toldthe New York Timesin Jacksonville, Florida. “I’m worried for my grandchildren,” she said. “I do it for them.”It is the fourth protest event to be staged by the group since Trump was inaugurated on 20 January. Previous events included a “No Kings Day” on President’s Day, 17 February, a theme adopted beforeTrump referred to himself as a king in a social media postdays later.View image in fullscreenA human banner at Ocean Beach in San Francisco, California, on Saturday.Photograph: Stephen Lam/APOrganizers have called for 11 million people to participate in the latest rallies, representing 3.5% of the US population.Such a figure would likely surpass the numbers who took part in the “Hands Off” rallies staged on 5 April, when 1,200 demonstrations were staged across the US to register opposition to Trump’s assault on government agencies and institutions, spearheaded by the president’s chief lieutenant, the tech billionaireElon Musk, and his unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge) unit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It also said it was seeking to build momentum that would lead to further and larger protests.Heather Dunn, a spokesperson for 50501, said the goal of Saturday’s protests was “to protect our democracy against the rise of authoritarianism under the Trump administration”.She called the group a “pro-democracy, pro-constitution, anti-executive overreach, nonviolent grassroots movement” that was nonpartisan.View image in fullscreenA protest in Midtown in New York City on Saturday.Photograph: Sachyn Mital/Rex/ShutterstockView image in fullscreenNew York City on Saturday.Photograph: Sachyn Mital/Rex/Shutterstock“We have registered Democrats, registered independents and registered Republicans all marching because they all believe in America, because they all believe in a fair government that puts people before profits,” she toldthe Washington Post.Academics who have tracked the slide of democracy into authoritarianism say protests can be part of a wider of strategy to reverse the trend.“Oppositions to authoritarian governments have to use multiple channels always,” said Steven Levitsky, a political scientist at Harvard University and co-author, with Daniel Ziblatt, ofHow Democracies Die. “They have to use the courts where those are available. They have to use the ballot box when that’s available, and they have to use the streets when necessary – that can shape media framing and media discourse, which is very, very important.”In Washington DC on Saturday, a protest planned by the 50501 movement was scheduled to take place in Franklin Park, while other protesters, including a local chapter of Indivisible, rallied outside JD Vance’s home, on the grounds of the Washington Naval Observatory. Protesters also gathered near the Washington monument for a march in support ofKilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran man wrongly deported to El Salvador from Maryland.Explore more on these topicsUS newsTrump administrationUS politicsProtestWashington DCnewsShareReuse this content"

Believe me, we’ve all got something to be mad about.”In stirring remarks, the 78-year-old former president, who was widely praised for how he helped the city grapple with its grief in the aftermath of the 19 April 1995 bombing in which 168 people died, including 19 children, offered a message of unity.‘The bomber’s words sound mainstream. Like he won!’ Oklahoma City’s tragedy in the time of TrumpRead moreClinton was just over two years into his first term as president when a truck bomb destroyed a nine-story US government building in the city’s downtown. He described how he was out jogging with the winners of the Boston marathon on the morning of the attack when he learned of the damage that had been done at the Alfred P Murrah federal building. “Thirty years ago, I thought I was going to have a different day,” he said.“Most of the people who lost their lives were public servants, as we all know,” Clinton said. “What they did every day was a matter of choice, showing up for work, to do business for the American people.”In his address, Clinton hinted at themes that were extremist in 1995 but have now become more established, noting that “in recent years the country has grown more polarized” and bringing the political forewarnings of theOklahomabombing into the present.“The terrorist who did this awful thing believed that it would spark a nationwide upheaval against the American government,” he said, “and would eventually destroy our government and democracy.“A lot of times a fanatic will tell you: ‘Sorry, this, that or the other thing had to happen but, you know, there had to be collateral damage sometimes to make a statement,’” he said. “But I’ve never heard anybody say that who had to live with the damage.”Clinton said Oklahoma City had offered the country an example of how to manage the response to tragedy. He referred to the “Oklahoma standard”, the resilient attitude described by news media and first responders to the tragedy, which was later embraced by the state and defined as “a statewide initiative preserving and promoting a culture of caring citizens by encouraging acts of service, honor and kindness”.The “bombing profoundly shook the country, and did more to all of you. But in the end it brought out the best in America,” Clinton told remembrance service attendees, and urged them to spread the same message to other Americans in the current turbulent political moment.“We can still find a way to move forward together with the Oklahoma standard,” he said. “We were there for you when you needed us. America needs you, and America needs the Oklahoma Standard. We all live by it.”He also joked that he felt more able to be candid now. “I’m old and can’t run for anything any more,” Clinton said. “I’m almost as old as President Trump.”Explore more on these topicsOklahoma CityBill ClintonFar right (US)US crimeOklahomaDemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

But with scandal-plagued incumbent Eric Adams sitting out the primary– he may run as an independent – the Ugandan-born Mamdani is in with a chance undera new ranked-choice voting system.“Zohran is breaking away as a clear second place and the alternative to the disgraced ex-governor Andrew Cuomo whose campaign is a house of cards,” Mamdani spokesperson Andrew Epsteintold theGothamistnews sitelast week.He added that the campaign has been successful so far by “being everywhere all of the time,” with more than 10,000 volunteers knocking on more than 100,000 doors, and by pushing out a platform of affordability, of rent freezes, free metro transport and city-run grocery stores – as well as the creation of a department of community safety to invest in citywide mental health programs and crisis response.Mamdani’s emergence as a viable candidate comes as another New York Democrat Socialist, congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, currently on a packed-out “Fighting Oligarchy” tour of the US, is being touted as the new face of the national party.Mamdani “represents the city of the future – a more Asian city, a more Muslim city, and what could be a more leftwing city,” says Democrat campaign veteran Hank Sheinkopf.With New York City ­containing about 800,000 Muslims, with 350,000 believed to be registered to vote, this could be the year that they show their power. “Every group shows its power in New York at some point because urban power in the US is all about competition for resources,” Sheinkopf adds.Mamdani is the son of Mira Nair, the Academy Award nominated film director ofSalaam Bombay!; his father,Mahmood Mamdani,is a professor at Columbia who studies ­colonialism. Around the family ­dinner table they would discuss Darfur and other political topics. Before ­running for office, Mamdani worked as a counsellor, a rapper under the name “Mr. Cardamom” and as a cricketer.As a lawmaker, he’s introduced a bill to eliminate tax exemptions for the city’s biggest universities, Columbia and NYU, arguing that the tax funds should go to underfunded public universities; and has said there is a “ceiling” on the power of representation in identity politics because “people cannot feed themselves and their family on someone looking like them”.When theObservercaught up with him at an anti-Tesla protest, he said “it was important that when we turn the page on Elon Musk, we also turn the page on all those who empowered and emboldened the accumulation of this kind of wealth through public policy and public subsidy”.Mamdani said New Yorkers “have a role to play in fighting back against the wealthiest man in the world, who has purchased the president of the United States. It’s critically important that we do so, and we show ourselves standing alongside New Yorkers from all walks of life who are saying that this cannot happen on our watch and our dime.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cuomo, a moderate Democrat, has gone to great lengths to portray antisemitism as a central campaign issue, calling it “the most serious and the most important issue” in New York , and portraying himself as a “hyper aggressive supporter of Israel and proud of it”.Mamdani has the capacity to win, says Sheinkopf, but his anti-Israel stance could be a problem: “Is Mamdani’s run a worthwhile demonstration of how healthy a democracy is? Yes. But he’s got to convince people his ­behaviour is within the bounds of what [they] consider appropriate.”Explore more on these topicsNew YorkThe ObserverDemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

Their attorney, Mark Geragos, planned to ask theLos Angelescounty judge Michael Jesic to reduce Erik and Lyle Menendez’s charges to manslaughter, which would allow them to be released from prison immediately.But as has often been the case in the brothers’ decades-long fight for release, it was not so straightforward. After a tense day in court, the Los Angeles county judge Michael Jesic delayed the proceedings until next month in response to the disputes between the defense and prosecution.“Today was a little bit disappointing for us as a family,” Anamaria Baralt, the brothers’ cousin, toldNBC Los Angelesoutside the courthouse on Thursday. “There have been some delays in this process that were unforeseeable, like the wildfires, that, of course, we have great patience for. This is another delay that is not so much, but we will continue to show up as a family.”In the last year, the brothers have hadnew hopefor the possibility of their release after a wave of public support, as well as the former Los Angeles district attorney’s announcement that he would recommend they be resentenced, and a decision from the governor to order the parole board to determine whether they would pose a risk to the public if they were released.In 1996,Erik, now 54, and Lyle, now 57, were convicted of first-degree murder in the shotgun killings of José Menendez, an entertainment executive, and Kitty Menendez. A judge sentenced them to life in prison without parole. The brothers had said they feared their parents were going to kill them to cover up years of sexual, psychological and physical abuse they had suffered at the hands of their father. Prosecutors portrayed the brothers as wealthy young men who killed to obtain their multimillion-dollar inheritance, and have argued they were not abused.They have recently sought freedom through multiple legal avenues, including by asking for a new trial in light of new evidence of their father’s abuse, a petition for clemency from the governor, and a request for resentencing. And last year, for the first time since their convictions, it began to appear they could have a meaningful shot at freedom. Adocumentaryand a popular – albeitcontroversial–Netflix serieshighlighted their stories and accounts of abuse and they received support from criminal justice reform advocates, includingKim Kardashian.George Gascón, the progressive former Los Angeles county district attorney, recommended the brothers be resentenced to 50 years to life, which would have made them immediately eligible for release underCalifornialaw. He said he believed the brothers were “subjected to a tremendous amount” of dysfunction and molestation, and argued they had paid their debt to society. He pointed to their behavior in prison, where they have earned college degrees and served as mentors and caregivers.But Gascón lost his seat to Nathan Hochman in November, and the new district attorney said he would not support resentencing and asked the court to rescind his predecessor’s motion. He argued the brothers have not taken full responsibility for their crimes and his office has said it does not believe they were abused.The brothers’ family, the majority of whom support their release, have been highly critical of the new DA, and asked that he be removed from the case. They said he is “incapable of handling this process with the fairness, care, or neutrality required by law”.This week’s hearing unfolded with the family in attendance as well as the brothers, who watched the proceedings via video from a state prison near San Diego.Hochman’s office had sought to delay this week’s proceedings, which were postponed in January because of the Los Angeles wildfires, to allow the court to obtain part of the comprehensive risk assessments completed by the state parole board.“If there is a report out there assessing the risk of violence, how do we not use it?” Habib Balian, the deputy district attorney, said in court on Thursday.The judge ultimately decided to postpone the proceedings to allow the prosecution and defense time to review the document, which the governor’s office has said is not a stand-alone risk assessment. The hearing in May will also look at a pending request from the brothers’ attorney, Geragos, on whether the district attorney’s office should be recused from the case.Geragos had denounced the district attorney for discussing the risk assessment report in a morning news conference. He said Hochman’s treatment of the case was “appalling”, and he and attorney Bryan Freedman, who represents Menendez relatives, were particularly critical of prosecutors’ decision in a hearing last week to show, without warning, a graphic crime scene photo of José Menendez while relatives were present.“That’s not dignity,” Freedman said. “That’s disrespect. That’s harassment.”Balian apologized for not warning the family about the image, but said: “Erik and Lyle Menendez caused that carnage, not me.”The family has said the act “retraumatized” them and led to the hospitalization, in critical condition, of Terry Baralt, José’s sister, who is 85 and has cancer. “This wasn’t just cruel.

Last year, Americans spent $5.4bn on Easter candy, according to the association.But the price of chocolate candy specifically has been rising over the last year, largely because of the soaring cost of cocoa, the key ingredient for chocolate. In 2023, farmers in west Africa – where 70% of the world’s cocoa is harvested – started tostrugglewith climate-related crises, including drought and plant disease, that decimated their cocoa production.Estimates put the cocoa deficit at more than 400,000 tons, significantly inflating the price of cocoa over the last few years. Cocoa has cost around $2,000 a ton over the last few decades. In 2024, it peaked at more than $12,000.This has led to chocolate prices soaring across the world. Hershey, the biggest chocolate producer in the United States, raised the prices of its chocolates last year, and ultimately struggled to maintain consumer demand. The company had itsworst profitin seven years in 2024.Chocolate is particularly sensitive to price increases because it’s an item in the grocery store that doesn’t really have any substitutes, said Joseph Balagtas, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University. This is why the price of eggs has risen so much, and whypainting potatoesinstead doesn’t quite work.“If you know you’re going to grill this weekend and chicken prices are high, maybe you’re more likely to make hamburgers or pork chops rather than chicken breast,” Balagtas said. “But chocolate-chip cookies without chocolate chips are a little tough.”Now, with Trump’s new tariffs in place, the price of chocolate is expected to rise even more. While economists don’t know exactly what the effects of tariffs will look like, theYale Budget Labestimates that tariffs could cost consumers $4,900 a year, with an average price increase of 3% across all goods.Chocolate prices will be no exception. When Trump introduced his latest slate of tariffs in early April, he had a direct message for American companies. “If you want your tariff rate to be zero,” he said, “then you build your product right here in America.”For many businesses deeply tied to the global supply chain, shifting manufacturing to the US is complicated and costly. For chocolate manufacturers, it’s impossible.The cacao plant, which produces cocoa, can only be grown in tropical climates, of which there are only two in the US: Hawaii and Puerto Rico. This means the vast majority of cocoa consumed in the US is imported.“The United States produces, I’m going to generously say, 100 tons of cocoa a year,” said Greg D’Alesandre, co-owner and chocolate “sourcerer” for Dandelion Chocolate in San Francisco. “We use about 120 tons of cocoa a year, and Dandelion is considered a very, very small chocolate maker. There’s no chance that [the US] can make all the cocoa that we actually need.”This means that chocolate makers big and small are affected by universal tariffs. Not only do chocolate producers have to worry about the high price of cocoa, but they also have to worry about inflation in other parts of their manufacturing process.“I’m more concerned about packaging prices,” said Oliver Holecek, owner of Primo Chocolate based in Troy, New York. “Most paper manufacturing happens in China, and there’s just really not a lot of great resources in the US yet.”Shipping prices could also be impacted by the tariffs, as congestion builds up at American ports as companies grapple with the new tariffs.It all adds up to an unstable environment, particularly for smaller chocolate businesses that don’t have the leverage and resources as bigger manufacturers.While Dandelion had to increase prices last year amid the rise in cocoa prices, D’Alesandre said it’s unclear how the company’s customer base will respond to further increases.“I’ve known three chocolate makers that have gone out of business over the last three years because there’s too much turmoil in pricing,” D’Alesandre said. “It’s very difficult to make a plan for it … we’re doing our best to make plans, but a lot of it is wait and see.”This article was amended on 19 April 2025. An earlier version omitted the unit of measurement when referring to the estimated cocoa deficit of more than 400,000 tons.Explore more on these topicsUS economySmall businessChocolateEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Behind them, a vivid graffiti portrait of a young Black woman filled the wall.The mural, by the Cape Town artistKilmany-Jo Liversage, is part of one of the largest private art collections in the world and, its curators believe, potentially the largest on public display.Nando’s has been buying South African art to display in its peri-peri chicken restaurants globally since 2004, amassing a collection of about 32,000 pieces from 700 artists and becoming one of the country’s most significant supporters of visual artists.View image in fullscreenNhlengethwa’s Construction Workers.Photograph: Raftermen“They’re like a parent to me,” said Liversage, who has created more than 10 murals for restaurants from Chicago to Dubai and sells one or two of her bright, spray-painted portraits of women to the company every few months.The chain was founded in Johannesburg in 1987 by Fernando Duarte and Robbie Brozin. The idea to start buying art came from Dick Enthoven, an insurance magnate who bankrolled the international expansion andcame to own the chain.Nando’s did not respond to questions, including whether the family of Enthoven, who died in 2022, still owns the private chain.Mirna Wessels, the chief executive of Spier Arts Trust, a non-profit that sources pieces for the Enthovens’ private collection and businesses, said: “It was a little challenging in the beginning … a lot of those hardy chicken and chips guys just didn’t understand why they would now have to include fine art on the walls.“But now I’m very comfortable and sure that it’s part of their DNA.”Diana Hyslop, who started painting in the 1990s after a stint drawing for Marvel Comics in London, said Enthoven was one of the “visionaries” who had had the biggest impact on her career.Hyslop, 75, who has sold about 250 of her magical realist works to Nando’s, said: “Dick bought a couple of pictures from the beginning … It’s been fantastic, very generous.”View image in fullscreenKagiso Patrick Mautloa says he is able to put more of himself into his work because of his relationship with Nando’s.Photograph: Spier Arts Trust for Nando’s Art CollectionNando’s, which has more than 1,200 restaurants in more than 20 countries, also runs the “Creative Block” programme, giving artists 18cm or 30cm square wooden blocks to work on and providing personalised feedback. Then, three to four times a year in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Gqeberha, artists can submit work for the Spier Arts Trust to select and present in turn to Nando’s executives.The company has a separate mentorship scheme for furniture and lighting designers. Over seven years, 70 designers had sold 65,000 pieces worth 200m rand (£8m) to Nando’s restaurants, said Tracy Lynch, executive creator director of Clout/SA, the business that manages the programme for Nando’s.Wessels said Nando’s bought about 2,000 works a year from 280 different artists, but would not share how much was spent, or the collection’s value.Tamlin Blake, the Spier Art Trust’s chief curator and a tapestry artist, said that in order to be considered for purchase, artworks had to be family-friendly, about 1 metre by 1.5 metres, and not behind glass. “I do believe if the work is authentic and has something to say and is beautifully made, there will be a space for it somewhere,” she said.View image in fullscreenClive Van den Berg’s What Happens in the Sky on display at the Banbury Nando’s, far left.Photograph: Jonathan BanksView image in fullscreenVan den Berg’s What Happens in the Sky.Photograph: Clive Van den BergKagiso Patrick Mautloa, 73, who creates everything from sculptures to mixed-media pieces, said the relationship gave him freedom: “I put more of myself into the work.”Wessels said relationships were key: “We just continuously run our career development programme, where artists are introduced to us. Tamlin will review and decide if an artist is serious about building an art career and has something unique to bring to table.”Anastasia Pather, who fingerpaints bright abstract pieces at her home studio in Johannesburg, said Nando’s had been buying her work since she first started exhibiting.The 37-year-old, who was part of a Nando’s exhibition in Dallas, Atlanta and now New Orleans, said: “If you have some assurance that there is a more consistent patron of your work, you can take a few more risks in your pieces … I just wouldn’t be able to be a full-time artist.”Vivien Kohler, whose works include everyday “found” objects such as street signs, said the art world’s elitism had initially shocked him: “I hated that. So my MO from then on was always accessibility … to allow the ordinary viewer to appreciate art. So for me, it’s brilliant, it’s perfect.”Explore more on these topicsArtFood & drink industrySouth AfricaRestaurantsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The mistake was understandable enough: high on the euphoria of beatingManchester City in the FA Cup final, Manchester United renewed his contract. Three months into the new season, more than £180m spent on summer transfers,Ten Hag was dismissedwith United 14th in the table on 11 points from nine games.The sporting director, Dan Ashworth, and various members of Ten Hag’s backroom staff also left, at a total cost of £14.5m. Or, to put it another way, keeping Ten Hag cost United £200m and in effect undermined this season. Nobody wants to be caught in the Ten Hag trap.Manchester United’s crazy comeback was inspirational – and a reality checkRead moreNo two cases are ever exactly alike. There is a tendency always to overcorrect on a simplistic understanding of what went before, which is why so many clubs flip-flop between idealistic dreamers and dour pragmatists – the fat pope, thin pope model of history.Even by United’s recent standards, the decision to stick with Ten Hag was bungled: openly talking to other candidates inevitably erodes confidence in the incumbent. But, equally, every club owner or director is aware of the Ten Hag trap and the need to avoid it. For a few years yet it’s going to be harder for a manager to save their job by winning a trophy and that is of direct relevance to bothAnge Postecoglouand Ruben Amorim.The threat to Amorim is, as yet, theoretical, although as the example of Sir Ben Ainsliewith Ineos’s sailing teamdemonstrates, Sir Jim Ratcliffe has a capacity to be ruthless. He will dismiss a high-profile figure just as readily as he will scrap a packed lunch, stewards’ bonus or pensioner concession. The case against Amorim, anyway, is largely that his football is not a fit for the squad and it would be cheaper and easier to replace the ideologue in the dugout than an entire dressing room of players.The ecstatic end toThursday’s Europa League quarter-finalagainst Lyon bolsters his position. As Rory McIlroy’svictory at the Masterslast Sunday showed, sport is at its best when it blends the anxious and hapless with the brilliant to produce an impossibly dramatic denouement. Those final minutes at Old Trafford, Kobbie Mainoo and Harry Maguire cast into emergency service as central forwards and both producing exceptional finishes, will be remembered for decades in the way a routine 2-0 win simply wouldn’t have been. Fans will forgive a lot of frustration for an experience like that –even if it is dependent on fallibility.View image in fullscreenEuphoric scenes at Old Trafford after Harry Maguire’s winning goal against Lyon.Photograph: Matt West/ShutterstockIn that sense, Thursday’s win could be for Amorim whatLiverpool’s 4-3 victory over Borussia Dortmundwas in the Europa League quarter-final in 2016, a game that did not lead to immediate success but did act as confirmation of the Jürgen Klopp project. The only caveat is that, for United, much the same could be said about the4-3 win over Liverpoolin the FA Cup quarter-final last season, and it turned out Amad Diallo’s extra-time winner was simply a lure on the way into the Ten Hag trap.The case of Postecoglou is more perilous. It is entirely plausible that Tottenham win the Europa League and the Australian still leaves the club, while United stick with Amorim having won nothing. But Thursday was a good night for Postecoglou, Tottenham’s most impressive away performance since the4-0 win at Manchester Cityin November. It’s perhaps not ideal that their idea of defending is apparently reliant on having a player with the freakish pace of Micky van de Ven but, on the other hand, they do, at the moment, have a player with the freakish pace of Micky van de Ven.The difficulty ofwinning at Deutsche Bank Parkshould not be underestimated – Spurs were only the fourth away side to do so this season of 21 who have tried – but equally Tottenham’s annual expenditure on wages is around three times that of Eintracht Frankfurt. That is no guarantee of success, but it does fit the theory that Postecoglou’s ultra-aggressive football works when, as in Scotland with Celtic, his side has an advantage of resource. That superiority will be even more pronounced in the semi-final against Bodø/Glimt.That shouldn’t devalue any success Tottenham may have, but it does perhaps place it into context. It is possible to mount a defence of Postecoglou on the grounds that injuries, particularly to the back four, ripped the heart out of the season, damaging confidence, and that, by the time a measure of stability was regained, the league campaign was already meaningless. But it’s also true that once the opening 10-game spurt was over, there has been little evidence of him having an aptitude for the Premier League.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It may even be that the best thing for a manager wanting a lengthy career at Tottenham is a very specific form of failure, one that prioritises Champions League qualification and its budgetary benefits over the more tangible achievement of trophies.Perhaps that is simply, once again, to point out the twin impulses that guide football and the friction that exists between them: routine wins and control may offer consistency and please the executives, but the visceral stirrings that animate fans come from nights such as Thursday at Old Trafford, the sort of nonsense and drama that scorns careful financial projections, or, indeed, any sort of planning at all.Executives will always favour reliability. Nobody ever built a successful business on unlikely players doing unlikely things at unlikely times; fans may delight in the flailing limbs of three goals after the 114th minute, but they mean less to the bottom line than consistency. And that is all the more pertinent given how aware everybody is of the need to avoid the Ten Hag trap.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedInside footballRuben AmorimAnge PostecoglouTottenham HotspurAustralia sportcommentShareReuse this content"

His own summation in the moments after the crash summed it up as he bluntly described himself as a “fucking idiot” over team radio.The pressure is intense this season, Norris in a nip-and-tuck fight with Piastri and Verstappen where every mistake could be crucial, as he leads Piastri by three points with Verstappen eight points back in third. Starting from 10th on Sunday his title lead is hanging by the slenderest of threads and his self-belief perhaps once more undermined.Saudi Arabian GP: Verstappen takes pole after Norris hits wall in F1 qualifying – liveRead more“I’m not going to be proud, I’m not going to be happy. I’ve let myself down and let the team down,” he said. Understandably dejected he then held his hands up and played down his chances of a comeback on Sunday.“I’m just disappointed with today. I will go see my engineers and apologise,” he said. “See what we can do tomorrow, we need a bit of luck, it’s almost impossible to overtake around here so I’m not expecting anything magical, if I can make the top five or six I would be happy.”McLaren and indeed Norris had looked strong all weekend but on the first of the final runs in Q3 at the Jeddah circuit he took too much kerb through turns four, five and six and it launched him into the wall, taking a nasty hit on the front from which he emerged unhurt but was clearly enormously disappointed in himself.In stark contrast, qualifying was marked by a buoyant and resurgent Verstappen in aRed Bullthat was proving far more to the world champion’s liking than the recalcitrant beast he had wrestled with last week. He set the pole with a blistering final lap in Q3 for 1min 27.294sec, threading the needle in a tense session with an attacking assurance that was a reminder of just how quick he can be when he has confidence in his ride.His team were also exemplary pulling a bold strategic move in having Verstappen complete two laps after the red flag caused by Norris’s crash; fuelled for two he took the first as a very strong sighter and nailed the final circuit.Verstappen was hugely pleased with the result, the pole going no little way at least to ease the tension at Red Bull. The Dutchman had been deeply dissatisfied after managing only sixth at thelast round in Bahrainwith a car that lacked balance and pace.He was blunt that he did not believe he could compete for the title as things stood and the team held discussions after that race to consider how best to address the issues.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen capitalised on Lando Norris’s error.Photograph: Thaier Al-Sudani/ReutersThe somewhat mercurial car can, however, be adapted over a race weekend successfully, as theyproved at Suzukaand once more they did very well to coax it into a peak operating window in Jeddah.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To return pole given how strong the McLarens were will be considered a huge result by the world champion and at Milton Keynes.In the wake of Bahrain questions were again raised about Verstappen’s future at the team, with Red Bull’s motorsport advisor, Helmut Marko, stating there was “great concern” he could leave. It prompted Verstappen to dismiss the issue this weekend and this performance will quieten the furore in the short term at least.For Norris this was another real setback. The team have been looking at how to adjust the car to accommodate him better but it was an ongoing process not expected to yield an immediate turnaround. He had looked very comfortable in Jeddah however and was in position to challenge for pole until he lost it and was punished on a track where any error is costly.Mercedes’ George Russell did superbly to claim a strong third place, Charles Leclerc was fourth for Ferrari and Kimi Antonelli in fifth for Mercedes. Lewis Hamilton once more struggled with his Ferrari, managing only seventh place, almost a second off the pole time.Carlos Sainz was sixth for Williams, Yuki Tsunoda in eighth for Red Bull and Pierre Gasly in ninth for Alpine,Alex Albon was in 11th for Williams, Liam Lawson and Isack Hadjar in 12th and 14th for Racing Bulls, Fernando Alonso in 13th for Aston Martin and Ollie Bearman in 15th for Haas.Lance Stroll was in 16th for Aston Martin, Jack Doohan 17th for Alpine, Nico Hülkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto in 18th and 20th for Sauber and Esteban Ocon 19th for Haas.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneThe ObserverMotor sportMcLarenLando NorrisMax VerstappenRed BullnewsShareReuse this content"

Could it stand to be a little shorter? Sure. Do the referees need to be more judicious with when they intervene? I’d argue they do. But therealproblem theNBAfaces is, in my opinion, a PR one. Its loudest voices should spend less time pearl-clutching and more time celebrating.Claire de LuneStar players sit, games blur together and offense is unchecked.I don’t know if I’d call it a crisis, but put it this way: Disney, NBC and Amazon Prime Videodid not pay $76bnforthisproduct. They’re betting that it will be fixed. The answer might be structural: tweak the rules to restore physicality. If defense matters again, maybe the games will too.Bryan Armen GrahamWell, if you count rights-holding networks badmouthing the product, the league blacking out local games and underselling on-court storylines as a crisis –then yes. If you count the in-season tournament, load management player protocols and the endless GOAT debates as a crisis – then also yes. I’m not suggesting fewer games (82 always felt right); I’m suggesting everyone take them more seriously. Talking to you, Adam Silver.Andrew LawrenceCan I be in a crisis when my organization commands $76bn in broadcast rights fees? That sad,a few tweaks might help. Spice up the in-season tournament by working point spreads into real-life results - eg the Celtics need to cover v the Hornets to move on – and awarding a conditional first-round draft pick known as “The Emirate” to the winner. Bring international play into the All-Star Weekend format and if you must, trim three or four games off the schedule. Oh, and please,please, lower ticket prices. Thank you!David LengelThere are multiple issues with the NBA such as an overindulgence of three-pointers, the forgettable All-Star game and perpetual foul-hunting. However,the notion of a crisis is a bit overblown. The Western Conference remained highly competitive until the final day of the season, the playoffs feature a mix of All-NBA veterans and rising young stars, and the NBA’s primetime viewership is up double digits from last season. There is space for improvement, but the league is far from being in crisis.AR ShawTeam that will be most missed from the playoffsIt’s a shame that Kevin Durant, one of the most skilled scorers this game has ever seen, isn’t going to make so much as a play-in-tournament appearance this year. To saythe Phoenix Sunshave been a disappointment is a woeful understatement, but it’s less theteamI’ll be missing and more the inimitable presence of the Slim Reaper.CDLThe Suns. Say what you will about their flaws, but they had three of the NBA’s best shot-makers in Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal and still couldn’t make it work. A brutal cap sheet and murky future means this might have been their last real shot.BAGCan I be selfish and saythe Chicago Bulls? For the first time since theirethereal first-half campaignto the 2021-22 season, the Bulls have been genuinely fun to watch – and the life of the party has been Josh Giddey, the triple-double threat who harks to the days when a healthy Lonzo Ball was leading the break. He showed enough to earn a long-term extension and another running mate to help get Chicago into the play-in stage.ALThe team or the players? I’m already missing KD and his band of grumpy, really upset Suns, and of course, we’re all praying to the god of your choice thatVictor Wembanyamawill be back next season. Overall,the Philadelphia 76ersmess is always a good follow, and I think we’ll all miss the day-to-day drama Joel Embiid and friends bring to the first round of the playoffs.DLThe San Antonio Spurs.The debut of “Playoff Wemby” appeared to be a possibility after the Spursacquired De’Aaron Foxbefore the trade deadline. But season-ending injuries to Wembanyama and Fox spoiled San Antonio’s playoff hopes. The combination of Wembanyama, Fox, the savvy veteran Chris Paul and rookie sensation Stephon Castle would have created havoc in the postseason. With better health, we can expect the Spurs to do damage in next year’s playoffs.ARSView image in fullscreenJalen Brunson and the New York Knicks are bidding to end the team’s 52-year NBA title drought.Photograph: Elsa/Getty ImagesHigh seed at risk of going out earlyVegas doesn’t have a lot of faith in second seeded-Houston in the playoffs, and neither do I. It’s commendable (hat tip to head coach Ime Udoka) thata super-young Rockets teamwere able to go from missing the play-in tournament last year to ending this year as the No 2 seed, but an unproven, youth-heavy, offensively challenged roster will likely get exposed in their first postseason outing.CDLThe Cleveland Cavaliershave depth, structure and a sparkling record, but playoff basketball is a different beast. Darius Garland has shrunk from the moment before, Evan Mobley remains a work in progress on offense and Donovan Mitchell can’t carry the load alone. If the tempo dips and the shots stop falling, this slick machine could unravel fast – especially against a battle-tested opponent.BAGThe New York Knicks,who blew a 28-point lead while losing to the top-seeded Cavaliers last Saturday to fall to 0-10 against top-three NBA teams. Point guard Jalen Brunson is one of a number of their key players dealing with injuries – none of which can be blamed on Tom Thibodeau’swithering instructionanymore, apparently. All of this sets them up poorly for their matchup against the resurgent Pistons and Cade Cunningham, a Knick-killer in the making. (He averaged better than 30 points, eight assists and five boards against them.)ALIsn’t thattheKnicks? Their fanbase certainly thinks so. A year ago New York were the out-hustle, out-muscle team that wanted it more than you. Today, they’re a fancy score-at-will side minus the edgy intangibles their fans lauded. Coincidentally, their opponents from Detroit have become the NBA’s newest junkyard dogs, ready to rip through the softened flesh of their now-bougie competition. Knicks fans can only hope the Pistons aren’t quite ready to pull it off.DLThe Rockets.Coach Ime Udoka did the unexpected by leading the Rockets to the No 2 seed in the rigorous Western Conference. But achieving the second-best record in the West appears to be a pyrrhic victory as Houston are underdogs against the Steph Curry and Jimmy Butler-ledGolden State Warriors. The scrappy Rockets will make each game uncomfortable for the more playoff-experienced Warriors, but expect an early exit for Houston’s youth movement.ARSLong shot to winTwo of the greatest playoff performers of their generation are now on the same team. I refuse to count outStephen Curry, Jimmy Butler andthe Warriors. They have a high-level defense, a lot of perimeter athleticism, and two guys who, on any given night, have a chance of being the best player on the floor. That sounds like a dark-horse contender to me.CDLThe Warriors. They started the season a hot mess. But since acquiring Jimmy Butler,they have been rolling. Steph is still Steph, Draymond Green is locking up again and their defense has quietly surged. With championship DNA and a renewed edge, they’re peaking at the perfect time.BAGIt’s weird to call a team that has Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Norman Powell and Ty Lue on the sideline a dark horse. But so it goes when that team isthe Los Angeles Clippers. While the Lakers and the Warriors helped the fairytale championship narrative with their blockbuster mid-season trades, the Clippers have been solid, steady and Leonard is looking like the Leonard of old .This could be their year.ALThe Clippersare a scorching hot No 5 seed who went 18-3 with eight straight wins to finish the regular season. That included a dramatic overtime victory at Golden State in their 82nd game to avoid the dreaded play-in. That’s mojo and that’s LA when Kawhi Leonard shows up, laces up and plays basketball. Now, if James Harden actually carries his regular-season skillset into the playoffs, these Clips could actually crack the colorful western cohort and sail into the finals.DLThe Clippers.Finishing the season with an 18-3 record, the Clippers are the most feared team heading into the playoffs. While LeBron James andLuka Dončićare the more celebrated NBA stars in Tinseltown, the Clippers have embraced the underdog role and are a dark horse to change the narrative with a Hollywood ending in the NBA finals.ARSView image in fullscreenShai Gilgeous-Alexander has led the Oklahoma City Thunder to one of the most dominant regular-season campaigns in NBA history.Photograph: Joshua Gateley/Getty ImagesMost important player this postseasonIt’s rare that the player upon which the pendulum swings is the same in two consecutive years, but once again, it’sLuka Dončić. I see the Lakers as having just as good of a chance as anyone to win the title this year. But as evidenced by the Lakers’ recent duel with the Warriors, when he isn’t firing on all cylinders, that chance diminishes exponentially. Los Angeles need Dončić to be a top-tier superstar for four rounds to hoist the trophy.CDLShai Gilgeous-Alexanderhas been an MVP candidate all year. Now comes the real test. OKC are deep, disciplined and dangerous, but their ceiling depends on SGA’s ability to create in crunch time. If he owns the moment, the Thunder could fast-track their rise from rebuild to finals.BAGAfter theJimmy Butlertrade, the Warriors went from Cancun-bound after the regular season to title contenders once again. More than just the best running mate Curry has had since Kevin Durant, Butler can carry the offensive load when Curry’s off the floor and take over games defensively. How the Warriors ever got away with him still boggles the brain.ALAfter dominating the regular season with a 68-14 record, Oklahoma City enter a postseason where anything short of a championships would be a disappointment. All of it rests on the wide Canadian shoulders ofShai Gilgeous-Alexander. As the head of the snake and the odds-on MVP favorite, SGA is solely responsible for delivering the hardware to OKC. And it’s a fair amount of pressure, especially after the Thunder were ousted last season by Luka’s Mavericks in the West semis.DLLeBron Jameswill be the most important player in the postseason until he retires. James is not only competing against current NBA players, he receives the most praise and ridicule when compared to his Hall of Fame predecessors. Win or lose, James will be the most discussed player in the off-season. If he captures another title at 40, it adds to the lore and never-ending debate over who is the greatest basketball player of all time.ARSEastern Conference finalsCeltics over CavaliersCDLCeltics over PacersBAGCeltics over CavaliersALCeltics over PacersDLCeltics over CavaliersARSWestern Conference finalsLakers over ThunderCDLThunder over WarriorsBAGWarriors over ClippersALClippers over LakersDLLakers over ClippersARSYour NBA champion will be ...Los Angeles Lakers. I’ll be accused of homerism for this pick, which I am prepared for. But I know a team on a special run when I see one, and the Lakers are that team. For Luka Dončić to get a ring in the same season he was unceremoniously shipped off by Dallas, for LeBron James to have a chance at a fifth championship before he retires, is something I can’t see either of these generational talents letting slip through their fingers. Lakers v Celtics will be a battle for the ages, and it’s truly a coin toss between the two in my estimation. But if the Lakers can get through the entire gauntlet that awaits them in the West, I simply don’t see them letting the chance at saying “job finished” pass them by.CDLOklahoma City Thunder. They’ve recorded the highest net rating in NBA history – better than the ‘96 Bulls or KD Warriors – but still feel oddly overlooked. SGA is playing at an MVP level, Jalen Williams is a rising star and Chet Holmgren shores up the middle. Their elite perimeter defense, depth and cohesion make them dangerous in any series. They may be young, but they’re relentless, unselfish and unafraid. This isn’t a fluke; it’s a coronation in waiting.BAGGolden State Warriors.They’ve got the best shooter who ever lived, one of the game’s all-time defenders and the best end-to-end player. Add Steve Kerr and the Warriors’ dynamite bench to the equation, and it’s tough to see the team losing out on a chance to win their fifth championship in 10 years. And if they happen to beat the Lakers along the way, the GOAT debate is going into overdrive – and history might ultimately peg LeBron as the loser.ALBoston Celtics. The wild second-half run of the Kawhi Clippers will finally come to an end when the clock strikes midnight against the Eastern Conference titans. Even the version of Harden who shows up for the playoffs isn’t enough to beat the Celtics, who overcome Jaylen Brown’s bum knee to oust the Clippers in seven. That’s because a healthy Kristaps Porzingis fills all voids and all baskets, propelling the dominant Jayson Tatum to swiftly avenge his Olympic benching while winning a second consecutive championship.DLLos Angeles Lakers.The Mavericks handed the Lakers a generational gift with the Luka Dončić trade, and LA will reap the benefits in June. The trade elevated the Lakers’ playoff chances from a second-round exit to legit title contenders, but the Lakers will face the toughest path to the finals with a first-round matchup against Anthony Edwards and the possibility of facing Steph Curry, Kawhi Leonard or leading MVP candidate Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in later rounds. Dončić and LeBron have both carried teams to the NBA Ffnals, and together, they have the offensive capabilities to overwhelm the most elite players and their teams. Expect the Lakers and Celtics to continue their historic rivalry with another showdown in the NBA finals with the Lakers as the last team standing.ARSExplore more on these topicsNBABasketballUS sportsBoston CelticsCleveland CavaliersIndiana PacersNew York KnicksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Eleven months on, he is poised to mark his first season as Liverpool’s head coach by becoming a Premier League champion and could seal the trophy by defeating a PSV and Manchester United legend, Ruud van Nistelrooy, and confirming Leicester’s relegation.Thoughts of spite will not enter Slot’s mind, however. He has been reserved since arriving at Anfield, but fans would revel in completing a merited title triumph at the King Power on Sunday. The added needle is much needed because Liverpool’s superiority has made the title race tedious. Others are to blame for that.Slot denies Liverpool dropped Darwin Núñez due to row at training groundRead moreThe advantage over second-placed Arsenal is 13 points with six games remaining. A defeat for the Gunners at Ipswich on Sunday followed by a Liverpool win would allow Slot to plan his outfit for the open-top bus parade. Considering his side’s 100% record against the bottom three – of five wins, 15 goals scored and five conceded – no one will be panicking at playing doomed Leicester.Despite the failings of those heading down and the gap at the top, Liverpool’s success and consistency should not be underestimated. Slot is adamant English football is the world’s best, prompting him to run through some of the season’s difficult games. “Wolves at home, even Southampton at home, Plymouth away, which is not even at Premier League level,” he says, before mentioning this month’sdefeat at Fulham.Smaller clubs are less competitive in the Dutch top division, he says. “It’s not only the Eredivisie. You see this in Spain, you see this in Italy. Multiple managers have said something about that.”Liverpool needed a late winner tobeat West Ham last Sunday. “They have players that can play for us and you don’t see that in the Italian league, you don’t see this in the Spanish league, you don’t see this in the Eredivisie,” Slot says. “You only see this in the Premier League and that’s why it’s such a popular league. That’s why people pay so much money, broadcasters, and that’s why we can bring so many good players in.”This season’s finest team do not have the style of a peak Pep Guardiola side, but they set the standard early with unfussy 2-0 wins over Ipswich and Brentford. The spectacular form of Mohamed Salah has helped Liverpool sit top since 2 November and despite the odd flirtation from chasers they have never looked like losing their grip on first place thanks to ruthless efficiency.View image in fullscreenArne Slot puts his squad through their paces on Friday.Photograph: Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesConcerns that Virgil van Dijk, Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold would leave for nothing this summer grew throughout the season, but provided no on-field distraction. This monththe DutchmanandEgyptian committed to Liverpoolbut the England defender will almost certainlypack his bags for the Bernabéu. Van Dijk did plenty of badge kissing and it did not feel performative; he always wanted to stay because life does not get better than being top of the league.The experience of Van Dijk and Salah has been key and they deserve the right to lift the trophy without contractual shadows over them. It would have been bittersweet for Liverpool to win the league and lose three men who have contributed so much over the past eight years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last Saturday’sdraw against Brightonbrought their first point and league goals since late January. Slot should be able to head home to the Netherlands after the match for a two-day break a joyful man, even if the title has to wait.He has not planned how he will celebrate securing Liverpool’s record-equalling 20th championship. “I’m only thinking about trying to win a game of football against Leicester,” he says. Others might not be believed, but Slot has never let his focus drift. Only when mathematically guaranteed will he truly enjoy himself.Supporters, players and coaches generally want to complete the job on home turf, but if that is not to be the case for Liverpool – who could also win the title on Wednesday without playing, when Arsenal host Crystal Palace – they will be placated if things are done and dusted early. There have been two league defeats, somewhat surprisingly against Nottingham Forest as well as Fulham. Liverpool cruised past Manchester City in two fixtures, making them look a shadow of the one that twice edged Jürgen Klopp’s heavy metal band into second.Months of hard work has alleviated the pressure. “The only thing I care about is the league table,” Slot says. “I like to look at it at the moment and I hope I can still like to look at it in one, two, three, four, five or six games.” The time for worry will soon be over.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolThe ObserverArne SlotfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We probably should have scored at least one more in that phase when you are at the Emirates against such a strong team. We worked hard to get that goal and it was just disappointing they scored very quickly.”Joe Montemurro returned to his former stomping ground in north London with a side high in confidence.

They were given a big boost with the return to fitness of Alessia Russo who replaced Stina Blackstenius up front.The hosts’ nerves were ­evident as they struggled for rhythm.

The ­visitors did not have to wait too long for their breakthrough, however. Beating Arsenal’s high press, Diani raced on to Ellie Carpenter’s through-ball before finishing with aplomb.

At a boisterous, increasingly gleeful Villa Park Unai Emery’s side moved up to sixth in thePremier Leaguewith a relentless dismantling of Newcastle, who simply fell away in the second half, conceding three goals in the final 20 minutes of a chastening 4-1 defeat.Newcastle remain in third and fought hard in the opening hour, after which life just seemed to catch up with them, Villa’s squad depth apparent as Emery shuffled his attacking substitutes with notable precision.O’Reilly and Kovacic sink Everton to boost Manchester City’s top-five hopesRead moreThe stadium was chilly and grey at kick-off, the air hazed with the after-burn of some surprisingly aggressive pre-match smoke geysers. This was one of the most jeopardy-ridden occasions of the Premier League’s end game, a top five face-off, third versus seventh, both clubs hungry for what has now become a key stream of ready cash in the age of profitability and sustainability rules plus pumped‑up Uefa revenues.Newcastle came here with an unchanged team and on a wrecking ball run of form, six straight wins, Harvey Barnes and Jacob Murphy leaving scorch marks on the flanks. In Eddie Howe’s absence Jason Tindall has offered a kind of hype-man leadership model. Bez has taken the mic, and at the best possible moment, with a team running on adrenaline.The real rock of Howe’s Newcastle is still its murder-ball midfield, which is designed to leave you bruised and breathless, to make every moment in that shared pocket of space an ordeal. Unai Emery stiffened his team here in response. Tyrone Mings for Pau Torres was a direct beefing up. Ollie Watkins was back in the XI, Marcus Rashford on the bench.Villa had played a suicidally high line against Newcastle in the5-1 defeat last season. Emery loves to tinker with the margins from game to game. The sense here was the home team would start a little deeper.Or not. It took 33 seconds for Villa to take the lead with a thrust down the left. Youri Tielemans picked up Sandro Tonali’s floated clearance and played an instant pass in to Watkins. He chopped inside and saw his shot deflected into the corner. It was Watkins’ first goal here since February.Four minutes later he hit the bar from almost the same spot after weaving unhindered through the right of the defence. But steadily Newcastle settled, Tonali grooving about in possession. There were some juddering early collisions. Dan Burn seemed to spend most of the opening 15 minutes splayed across the turf, hurling himself into assorted lunges and body-checks.View image in fullscreenAston Villa’s Ollie Watkins (centre) celebrates scoring the opening goal against Newcastle.Photograph: David Davies/PAAnd with 17 minutes gone Newcastle were level. It came from a free-kick into the Villa box, headed clear and picked up by Barnes on the right, who crossed deep for Fabian Schär to hover and power a header into the net.Quick! Back down the other end! Almost immediately Ian Maatsen found space on the Newcastle right and crossed for Marco Asensio to miss his kick in front of goal, a precision missed-kick, side-foot, eyes over the ball, just the faintest of sliced contacts. With 26 minutes gone Watkins hit the woodwork again, the same side, this time with a free header from a free-kick. He really should have scored.And so it went on, a series of surges from end to end. Tonali drew a fine full length save from Emi Martínez. Nick Pope palmed away a drive from Morgan Rogers, then scrambled the resultant corner out off his knees. Half-time came at a breathless pace, the score somehow still only 1-1.It was more of the same after the break. John McGinn, such a fine ­comfortable chair of a ­midfielder, saw more of the ball in his ­playmaking role.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tielemans was also having a fine game, ­counterpressing well in the clinches around the Newcastle box, something Emery has brought out of his game.With an hour gone Pope made a good save from McGinn, rushing to edge of his box and blocking with an outstretched arm.Villa deservedly took the lead again on 63 minutes with a fine goal, a quick break from midfield fed to Watkins who released Maatsen into space outside him. He didn’t break his stride, running on and clipping a lovely finish past Pope into the far corner. The Holte End erupted, Emery whirled and punched the air on his touchline, Zorro-like all in black.With 20 minutes to go Jacob Ramsey and Amadou Onana came on, a weary looking McGinn coming off. And Villa scored almost instantly, again from the left, this time a cross from Ramsey, turned into his own goal by Burn in a tangle of feet. At which point the other sub abruptly made it four, Onana smashing a shot high into the net after Pope had saved from Rogers. It was a brilliant finish, and a supreme pair of substitutions from Emery.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Villa kept pressing.

The Spanish forward then stunned the home fans when he scored two more goals in the second half, twice racing through to beat the keeper on his way to a hat-trick.However, Barça’s Dani Olmo and Raphinha soon netted four minutes apart to draw level at 3-3. Celta held on for almost half an hour but conceded a late penalty for a foul on Olmo which was awarded after a check by the video assistant referee, with Raphinha stepping up to fire the ball into the top corner in the 98th minute.“This is football. We wanted to win this game but we weren’t always at our best. But the team came through in the end and the crowd pushed us on right to the finish,” Barça substitute and goalscorer Olmo told Dazn. “It’s three points towards our objective but we have to keep going.”PosTeamPGDPts1Barcelona3256732Real Madrid3133663Atletico Madrid3127634Athletic Bilbao3124575Villarreal301351Madrid will seek to return Barcelona’s advantage to four points when they host Athletic Bilbao on Sunday night.“It’s a bittersweet feeling because we did a lot of things right.

For a lot of the game we were better than them, but we go away with a bad feeling because of the result.”Barcelona will be sweating over Robert Lewandowski’s fitness after the Polish striker went down clutching his leg and was taken off late in the game. A hamstring injury may rule the 36-year-old – who has 40 goals this season – out of their Copa del Rey final next weekend against Real Madrid while Barcelona also face Inter in the Champions League semi-finals this month.“Lewandowski will have an MRI tomorrow.

At the other end, Dinko Horkas produced sharp saves to deny Julián Alvarez and Alexander Sørloth.In a slower-paced second half, Atlético dominated possession but were unable to create clear scoring chances against a disciplined defence from the hosts. Seconds before the match ended in a goalless draw, Muñoz capitalised on sloppy defending by Atlético, who failed to clear the ball, allowing the midfielder to shoot from close range and finally beat goalkeeper Jan Oblak. The goal was initially ruled out for offside, but a VAR review overturned the decision three minutes into stoppage time, sparking wild celebrations at the Estadio Gran Canaria.“It was a tough match, a defeat we have to put behind us and move on. But today is tough,” Atlético defender Robin Le Normand told Movistar. “It’s clear that every point is important. Beyond fighting for the title, we wanted to play a very good match ... They didn’t create much, but they’re playing for salvation, fighting for every ball. We didn’t get it right.”The surprising victory allowed Las Palmas to climb to 17th place and temporarily escape the drop zone with 32 points, two ahead of Alavés, who play at Sevilla on Sunday.“I was certain that I wasn’t offside. When I saw that the ball was dead, I went to take advantage of the play,” Muñoz said. “There’s a lot of fighting left but we’re going to fight until the end. Let’s enjoy the victory and hope it helps us to keep believing that the team can do it.”In GermanyBayern Munichhad little trouble beating lowlyHeidenheim4-0 to put themselves within touching distance of the Bundesliga title. The table now shows Bayern at the top with 72 points, nine clear of Bayer Leverkusen who face St Pauli on Sunday, with four rounds left to play.With Bayern racing into a three-goal lead after just 36 minutes – courtesy of Harry Kane’, Konrad Laimer and Kingsley Coman – there was little doubt about the outcome. Joshua Kimmich then rifled a shot home for 4-0 in the 56th minute as Bayern surged ahead at full throttle in their pursuit of another league crown.Heidenheim, fuelled by pride and eager to salvage something from an otherwise dismal performance, came close to pulling back a goal just after the hour mark. But Bayern keeper Jonas Urbig was sharp and alert, diving low to deny Sirlord Conteh with a smart save. For the hosts, the situation looks bleak: they are third from bottom in the relegation playoff places with 22 points, seven behind St Pauli, who occupy the last safe spot.View image in fullscreenHarry Kane celebrates after the match.Photograph: Heiko Becker/ReutersIn Serie A a second-half header by Scott McTominay securedNapolia 1-0 win at relegation-threatenedMonzaas Antonio Conte’s side provisionally moved level with leaders Inter.McTominay nodded home to put Napoli in front in the 72nd minute, scoring from a lovely lofted cross from the corner of the area by Giacomo Raspadori.Second-placed Napoli are level with Inter on 71 points from 33 games, before the defending champions travel to Bologna on Sunday. Monza sit bottom with 15 points, 11 points from safety.Ligue 1 championsParis Saint-Germaincontinued their quest to become the only team in the French top flight to remain unbeaten throughout a season with a routine 2-1 home win overLe Havre. Luis Enrique, with the title win wrapped up two weeks ago, made nine changes from the side that advanced to the Champions League semi-finals in midweek despite losing the second leg against Aston Villa.The hosts took the lead in the eighth minute when Bradley Barcola rolled a pass into the box to Désiré Doué whose control took him past his marker before he hit a shot that took a deflection on its way to the net.Le Havre were completely outplayed in the first half and were relieved to go into the break just one goal down but PSG doubled their lead five minutes after the interval. After some intricate close passing around the opposition area, Senny Mayulu dinked the ball over onrushing keeper Mathieu Gorgelin leaving Gonçalo Ramos with the simplest of tap-ins from close range. The visitors pulled one goal back on the hour mark through Issa Soumaré’s header from a corner kick move but were unable to muster another chance on target as treble-chasing PSG earned their 10th consecutive league win.Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballThe ObserverLa LigaBarcelonaCelta VigoBundesligaBayern MunichHeidenheimnewsShareReuse this content"

Nico O’Reilly and Mateo Kovacic sealed a win that even Pep Guardiola may not have seen coming to keep City on course for a 15th successive season among the European elite.A goalless draw appeared the most likely outcome for much of a pedestrian contest, but a late surge, shaped by the contrasting impact of substitutes, allowed City to dominate and secure a ninth consecutive win here. Aston Villa’s visit to the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday represents a hugely significant moment in a troubled season for Guardiola and his team.Aston Villa v Newcastle United: Premier League – liveRead more“A big win, massively important,” the City manager said. “We are miles away from Liverpool and Arsenal, but tonight we sleep fourth and we will see what happens to Villa, Newcastle, Nottingham Forest, Fulham and Chelsea. Now it is in our hands.“We need a final on Tuesday. Three games at home, two away and hopefully we can achieve this big success to qualify for the Champions League.”A finale in which City substitutes Jérémy Doku and Kovacic flourished while theEvertonsubs Michael Keane, Carlos Alcaraz and Tim Iroegbunam floundered was out of context with everything that had gone before. City dominated possession early on, but without urgency, intensity, movement and ideas of how to break a well-drilled Everton defence their first half performance was tedious in the extreme. The referee, Simon Hooper, was not the most popular figure inside Goodison, but he deserved a medal for adding three seconds on to the end of the opening period.The best, and only real, chance of the first half fell to Everton. James Tarkowski towered above Josko Gvardiol at a James Garner corner and steered a header against the inside of Stefan Ortega’s left post. Matheus Nunes hacked clear before Jake O’Brien could pounce on the rebound.Tarkowski pulled up with a hamstring injury early in the second half and was crestfallen as he was helped off the pitch. It could prove to be the Everton captain’s final appearance here depending on the severity of the injury. It proved a turning point.View image in fullscreenMateo Kovacic celebrates after wrapping up victory.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPA“For 60-odd minutes I thought we were OK and we gave them a game,” said David Moyes. “Tarky coming off made a big change in the game. It shouldn’t have, but it did. You could feel it. Man City sensed it as well.”Everton started the second half strongly. Ortega saved from Jarrad Branthwaite after Tarkowski headed a free-kick from Garner on to his central defensive colleague. Branthwaite, unmarked and six yards out, directed his header straight at the City goalkeeper.Ortega then missed a deep cross from Harrison and Gvardiol made an important block as Abdoulaye Doucouré attempted to capitalise. Doucouré was also foiled by Ortega when he aimed for the top corner.Tarkowski’s departure and an unconvincing display by his replacement, Keane, tilted the contest back in City’s favour. He was booked within three minutes of his introduction for a late challenge on Omar Marmoush and was badly off the pace.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their respective owners, Matthew Benham and Tony Bloom, estranged former associates, have cracked the alchemy of the game, winning much admiration though taking further steps forward is yet more difficult and proving much harder.In the battle between 10th and 11th, winnersBrentfordwere the more progressive, dangerous and calm side, though weathered a late storm from an opponent reduced to 10 men. Christian Nørgaard’s injury-time header from Mathias Jensen’s free-kick completed victory.O’Reilly and Kovacic sink Everton to boost Manchester City’s top-five hopesRead moreA chaotic game closed out with more than 20 minutes of added time after a late collision between Yunus Konak and Jan Paul van Hecke. Brighton’s Dutch defender was treated with oxygen and taken to hospital as a precaution. He was later discharged after being given the all clear.Beating Brighton for the second time in their Premier League rivalry was most welcome for Brentford. “We had to win,” said their manager, Thomas Frank. Their outsiders’ challenge for Europe was revived via the partnership of Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa, the Cameroon forward scoring twice, the Congolese once. All three goals had the partnership, with 34 between them, acting in glorious tandem.“An incredible achievement for them,” said Frank. “All the praise for the two of them for how hard they work, then for my staff and then also something for the way we play.”In Brighton’s case, having spent £200m last summer, a Conference League position would have been at the lower end of hopes but looks unlikely. Having last won away at Southampton in February, defeat in west London extended Brighton’s winless run to five. Too many Brighton players have lost form, too few of last summer’s arrivals have shone. Fabian Hürzeler, in his first top-flight season, could learn plenty from the wiles of Frank. “I am responsible for that,” he said. “I have to find the right solutions. We know that some things are not working. We make too many individual mistakes.”Brighton cannot say they were not warned. As is customary, Brentford quickly threw themselves at the task in hand. Keane Lewis-Potter has won admirers as an attacking left-back, and from his right-foot pass, Mbeumo surged beyond Brighton’s sleepy defence to score the opener.View image in fullscreenChristian Nørgaard heads Brentford’s fourth goal in stoppage time.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersBrighton might have quickly levelled had Yankuba Minteh got his angles correct before Danny Welbeck, surely Brighton’s player of the season, made up for an earlier miss by heading the equaliser on the stroke of half-time.Brighton again failed to cope with their forewarning of Brentford starting halves with intention. Within three minutes, Mikkel Damsgaard’s pass found Wissa, who instinctively laid the ball into the path of Mbeumo, the shot deflecting off Lewis Dunk’s chest. “I am very happy that he’s shining and the main man,” said Frank. “It’s a duo, with Wissa scoring more goals in open play but Bryan is an incredible footballer.”Frank’s determination is his team do not sit on leads. Another sweeping move cut Brighton to ribbons, Damgsaard fading his pass to Mbeumo, who laid up Wissa, the shot deflected in off the again unfortunate Dunk.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Moments before his tangle with Nathan Collins, João Pedro had been denied when scuffing a half-chance. He took out his frustrations with a flailing, petulant swipe. Hürzeler, with his own disciplinary issues, kept his own counsel, seating himself once Tim Robinson, the referee, had waved red.When Welbeck was subbed for Yasin Ayari, Brighton fans loudly questioned their manager and why their team now had no striker. “I wanted to have more midfielders to control the game and more connections with the fast wingers,” said Hürzeler.Bloom, seated in the away end due to his differences with Benham, was left in no uncertain terms of doubts in a young manager who said: “I focus on the game.”Kaoru Mitoma’s finish from Jack Hinshelwood’s pass briefly revived spirits. As did eight added minutes, extended by that horrible collision. By then, Brighton’s hopes had already been extinguished by Nørgaard, his goal embodying Brentford’s belief there can always be another.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverBrentfordBrighton & Hove Albionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It was a game that we should have won,” said the Bournemouth manager, whose side have nonetheless surpassed the club’s record points tally in thePremier Leaguewith five matches still to play, including meetings with Manchester United, Arsenal and Aston Villa in their next three. “I hope that we can be in this fight until the last game.”Oliver Glasner revealed that a meeting with his players after their return from the5-0 thrashing against Newcastlehad “changed completely” the mood in his squad. The news that the outstanding right wing-back Daniel Muñoz has extended his contract until 2028 was another reason to feel optimistic as they prepare for an FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa. It was a 4-1 victory over Unai Emery’s side here in February that kickstarted their winning home run, although they will hope for better treatment from the officials if they are to stand a chance of reaching the final.“What we need is consistency. It’s either two red cards or no red cards,” said Glasner. “This was the feeling everyone had at half-time. It’s really difficult to deal with this situation so I’m pleased with how they responded. We could have collapsed, but we didn’t and now the confidence is coming back.”Iraola is set to hold talks with the Bournemouth, owner Bill Foley, next week over extending his contract that ends next year with reported interest from Tottenham. The Spaniard is not the only Bournemouth employee who is coveted elsewhere. Antoine Semenyo, who was rejected by Palace as a teenager and has been linked with a move to Manchester United, was the game’s best performer and he had the first sight of goal after a quiet start from both sides. But the Ghana forward mis-hit a shot and a deflection took Dean Huijsen by surprise at the back post as the ball struck him on the hip.Bookings for central midfielders Tyler Adams and Scott were all the home supporters had to get excited about as Palace struggled to find their rhythm in attack. By contrast, Bournemouth looked a threat every time they poured forward as Semenyo – who could cost up to £70m this summer if reports are to be believed – and Justin Kluivert found space in between the lines. Scott looked extremely relieved to escape another yellow card after hauling down Ismaïla Sarr just outside the area, but a strangely subdued Eberechi Eze struck the wall with the resulting free kick.Disaster struck for Palace on the stroke of half-time when Richards, who had been cautioned for a foul on Dango Ouattara, was dismissed for pulling back Kluivert. The referee left the pitch to a chorus of boos at half-time and there were more when the fortunate Scott was replaced by Lewis Cook for the second half.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But they were not even the worst team at the London Stadium for long periods of a dreadful game, and they snatched a deserved point deep into added time when the Chelsea loanee Ugochukwu drove home through a crowded penalty area.Bournemouth falter in race for Europe as 10-man Crystal Palace scrape drawRead moreTheSouthamptonfans behind the goal celebrated as if they had won the league, probably drowning out groans from Derby after they saw their record-low points tally of 11 from the 2007-08 season matched.Meanwhile, to say West Ham have not got going under their new manager, Graham Potter, is an understatement. The Hammers have picked up an average of one point a game since Potter took over, a worse record than that of his maligned predecessor, Julen Lopetegui.Potter criticised his players afterwards for their inability to control games and admitted he faces some big decisions this summer. “I can’t say we deserved much more, which is a reflection on how disappointed we are,” said the manager. “Credit to Southampton, but we didn’t do enough to win and in the end, we have to look at the reasons why.“If you have to be the protagonists of the game, which I think West Ham are at home to Southampton. We have to be able to control things and be able to attack and be able to be in control of the situation.“We weren’t able to do that and in the end, that always feeds the opponent, no matter where they are in the league, whatever their points tally is.“We have to look at the season as a whole and zoom out and think about what decisions we can make going forward, because where we are now and how we’re playing, we need to improve.”West Ham did almost grab the lead inside three minutes through Niclas Füllkrug, starting his first game since January after another spell out injured. The Germany striker got a toe to Lucas Paquetá’s ball into the box ahead of Jan Bednarek but his effort was well saved at his near post by Aaron Ramsdale.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Yet despite still not being mathematically safe from relegation – albeit with realistically little chance of making the drop – the hosts plodded through the first half with a bewildering lack of urgency. Southampton, with two wins to their name all season, were by far the more threatening side, with Kamaldeen Sulemana teeing up Kyle Walker-Peters, who drove across goal and narrowly wide.The league’s lowest scorers came even closer after half an hour when Jack Stephens’s shot was blocked by Paquetá, with Sulemana thudding the rebound against the bar.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The goal came from a Southampton corner, with Emerson Palmieri and then Mohammed Kudus strolling forward before finding Füllkrug, whose incisive pass played in Bowen to score his 10th goal of the season.It was the 78th goal conceded by the Saints this term. That almost became 79 when Füllkrug headed in a James Ward-Prowse corner at the far post, but the striker’s forearm into the throat of Ramsdale ensured it was rightly chalked off.Southampton’s chances of a point looked to have disappeared along with the ball after the substitute Tyler Dibling blazed over. But in the fourth minute of added time Dibling found Walker-Peters, whose cross deflected off Max Kilman and was lashed in by Ugochukwu.Their interim manager, Simon Rusk, was delighted with a point. “I think we can be really pleased. I thought that it was the least we deserved,” he said.“I thought the players showed mental stamina in the second half and didn’t in any way, shape or form feel sorry for ourselves. And we fully deserved our equaliser at the end.“I’m really pleased to see that they’ve had a moment with the fans at the end. That was a nice moment to observe.

Premier League matches accounted for 20% (15.8 million) of all sports attendances.Ilie Oleart, from Barcelona, founded LMI, which has covered football matches in England for Spanish-speaking fans around the world since 2011. The channel has attracted nearly half a million subscribers, and in 2018 began offering trips to the UK so fans could experience the English game.Oleart, who supports the Catalan club Espanyol, who play in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football, said he aspired to not only arrange trips but to be involved in a club in a more meaningful way.“Our aim was to transform a small local English club into a small local club with a global fanbase,” he said.Harborough Town FC,nicknamed the Bees, emerged as the fans’ choice after Oleart consulted his subscriber base. LMI has brought its subscribers along to watch matches at the grounds of Brighton and Hove Albion, Sheffield United and Wycombe Wanderers.“I met people at the club in September to get to know their history, the town and the facilities,” said Oleart. “We thought they were the perfect club with the right values to share with our audience.”Football matches at Harborough Town, which take place in the Southern League Premier Division Central , will now feature live on the LMIYouTubechannel, allowing Spanish speakers an opportunity to become “virtual supporters” of the club.The Bees chair, Peter Dougan, said the partnership with LMI was an “opportunity to grow our fanbase and our income” through a global audience and could open the door to sponsorship deals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wilson is now the 20th man on that list afterhis defence came to a shuddering haltwithin hours of this year’s tournament beginning, after the world No 39 produced a magnificent comeback victory.Kyren Wilson: ‘It’s not just me that’s world champion. It’s my whole family’Read moreWilson led Lei 6-3 after the opening session on Saturday but crucially, it was Lei who won the final frame in the morning to ensure the deficit was just three frames, rather than five. The 21-year-old then won six successive frames to start the evening session, all with breaks of 50 or more, to move to the verge of victory.Wilson returned serve with a clearance of 106 and edged two more nerve-shredding frames to send it to a decider. At that stage, all the momentum seemed to be with the champion. But Lei held his nerve to deliver a break of 66 and close out one of the biggest shocks in the Crucible’s recent history.As well as that, he ensured the curse would continue for at least another year as well as, more importantly, raising hopes even further that Chinese snooker may be on the verge of what it has craved for some time.The hopes of a nation have largely rested on the shoulders of Ding Junhui for quite some time, and when 10 Chinese players were suspended as part of a match-fixing investigation in 2023, it left the sport under a dark cloud. However, a record 10 players – almost a third of the draw – from China have qualified for this year’s tournament.Such is the spread throughout that draw too, that it seems incredibly likely that at least two will meet in the quarter-finals. Xiao Guodong led Matthew Selt 7-2 after their opening session. And while Lei stole the show and the headlines on the opening day here, all eyes on Sunday will be on one of the brightest hopes Chinese snooker has ever seen.View image in fullscreenLei Peifan produced a huge upset on the first day of the world championship when he defeated Kyren Wilson 10-9.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PAZhao Xintong was one of the 10 playersbanned in 2023, serving a 20-month suspension for his part in the scandal. But he has been tipped for stardom from a young age, and has returned to the amateur tour since the expiration of his ban in some style, making a maximum break and coming through qualifying to reach the Crucible.He is only the third non-professional to reach the main draw. He begins against last year’s finalist, Jak Jones, and will now meet Lei in the last 16 if he navigates that task. Many within the sport believe Zhao is best placed to become China’s first world champion, including the great Stephen Hendry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Crucible was a marvellous sight on Saturday; the history seeps from the walls and the surrounding areas are a hive of activity. Few sports are as synonymous with one city quite like Sheffield is with snooker.But there is no doubting the Crucible has its limitations, and talk of moving the world championship is never far from the agenda. With the tournament’s current deal up in 2027, should a Chinese player finally win the game’s biggest prize over the coming fortnight, who knows where it could lead, with the tournament watched by as many as 200 million people in China.Whether Lei is the man to do that, or one of the other players from China in action at this tournament, remains to be seen. But this victory was a statement moment so early into proceedings in Sheffield: not just for the continuation of the curse, but the belief that after so long, maybe this is Chinese snooker’s time.Explore more on these topicsWorld Snooker ChampionshipThe ObserverSnookernewsShareReuse this content"

She had a player of the match performance and scored two tries.Rampant Red Roses rout Scotland to set up grand slam decider with FranceRead moreWhen asked if MacDonald had given him a selection conundrum on the wing, Mitchell said: “Most players have given me a headache, there is plenty of competition in the side. There’s Jess [Breach], Claudia, Abby [Dow], Mia [Venner] – who hasn’t played since Italy – so it is a good headache to have.“Claudia is an international rugby player of the highest quality. She has created competition, she has a different skillset to the other wingers as well which is something that will become very useful for us.”The win against Scotland has set up a grand slam decider against France next Saturday. Mitchell was pressed on how he will make selection decisions as the team aims for their seventh successive Six Nations title. He said: “It’s just my job, it is what I am employed to do. We are a high performing team, we look to get better. We are not No 1 in the world for nothing. These girls are unbelievable, the way they push each other in training, the way they support each other. [Selection] is a high place of care. I might be demonstrating that I have been a professional for a long time, making hard decisions is part of my job. There is still a large bit of high care when it comes to making selections but we don’t just select people on just their talent.“Next week is a different tactical game altogether. Tactically the skillsets that are needed in that performance will definitely be considered.”Scotland, meanwhile, face Ireland in their final game of the tournament and will be bidding to record their second victory of the championship after beating Wales in round one. Despite the heavy loss to England, the fly-half Helen Nelson believes it is a step forward for Scotland.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is the moment of the season we all enjoy – big games. It’s these games that make us great and that show us the level where we want to get to.”The technically gifted midfielder, whoscored at Stamford Bridge a year agowhen Barcelona overturned a first-leg deficit to reach their fourth final in a row, pointed to Chelsea’s recruitment directly from Barcelona of the England duo Lucy Bronze and Keira Walsh as having improved the English team. “They have Keira and Lucy, so they’re a better team these days. We miss them, because they helped us a lot.”Lauren James is set to miss the game for Chelsea because of a hamstring injury sustained during the April international break while helping theLionesses beat Belgium 5-0at Ashton Gate. For Barcelona, Caroline Graham Hansen is a doubt after missing Saturday’s training session with illness.Graham Hansen scored in each leg of the 2023 semi-final meetings between the sides as well as in the 2021 final when Barcelona emphatically saw off Chelsea witha 4-0 win in Gothenburg. Barcelona’s coach, Pere Romeu, said: “She had a rough night. We decided it was best for her to stay home and rest, but the match is in the evening, and we hope she’ll be fine.”Romeu, who is in his first season in charge after replacing Jonatan Giráldez last June, also praised Sonia Bompastor’s side, adding: “That we’ve never been knocked out by Chelsea is in the past and doesn’t affect tomorrow’s game. It will be a long tie. It will be a closely contested tie. We have analysed the opponent a lot and have trained in a specific way to exploit our strengths and attack their weaknesses.”Barcelona have won four games in a row in all competitions since their first defeat in a women’sClásicoagainst Real Madrid in March, and Romeu’s side were in ominously strong form when they dismantled Wolfsburg in the quarter-finals with a relentless 10-2 aggregate win. They hold a seven-point lead over Real at the top of the Spanish top flight, having lost only two league fixtures this season while scoring 107 goals in their 26 league matches so far.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Morant rolled the ankle coming down on Buddy Hield’s foot. Morant limped off the court and returned in the fourth quarter when he was held to four points as the Grizzlies lost 121-116.Morant took the court late in warm-ups to test his ankle.

He finished with nine rebounds, seven assists and three steals before interim coach Tuomas Iisalo pulled his starters in the final couple minutes to some rest. Morant wound up playing 33 minutes helping the Grizzlies finish off a wire-to-wire win.Injuries limited Morant to 50 games during this regular season.

Is offloading our cognitive work to AI driving this trend?Helen ThomsonSat 19 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTShareImagine for a moment you are a child in 1941, sitting the common entrance exam for public schools with nothing but a pencil and paper. You read the following: “Write, for no more than a quarter of an hour, about a British author.”Today, most of us wouldn’t need 15 minutes to ponder such a question. We’d get the answer instantly by turning to AI tools such as Google Gemini,ChatGPTor Siri. Offloading cognitive effort to artificial intelligence has become second nature, but with mounting evidence that human intelligence is declining, some experts fear this impulse is driving the trend.Of course, this isn’t the first time that new technology has raised concerns. Studies already show how mobile phones distract us, social media damages our fragile attention spans and GPS has rendered our navigational abilities obsolete. Now, here comes an AI co-pilot to relieve us of our most cognitively demanding tasks – from handling tax returns to providing therapy and even telling us how to think.Where does that leave our brains? Free to engage in more substantive pursuits or wither on the vine as we outsource our thinking to faceless algorithms?“The greatest worry in these times of generative AI is not that itmaycompromise human creativity or intelligence,” says psychologistRobert Sternbergat Cornell University, who is known for his groundbreaking work on intelligence, “but that it already has.”The argument that we are becoming less intelligent draws from several studies. Some of the most compelling are those that examine the Flynn effect – the observed increase in IQ over successive generations throughout the world since at least 1930, attributed to environmental factors rather than genetic changes. But in recent decades,the Flynn effect has slowedor even reversed.In the UK, James Flynn himself showed that theaverage IQ of a 14-year-old droppedby more than two points between 1980 and 2008. Meanwhile, global study the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) shows an unprecedented drop inmaths, reading and science scoresacross many regions, with young people also showing poorer attention spans and weaker critical thinking.James Flynn: IQ may go up as well as downRead moreNevertheless, while these trends are empirical and statistically robust, their interpretations are anything but. “Everyone wants to point the finger at AI as the boogeyman, but that should be avoided,” saysElizabeth Dworak, at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, who recently identified hints of a reversal of the Flynn effect in a large sample of the US population tested between 2006 and 2018.Intelligence is far more complicated than that, and probably shaped by many variables – micronutrients such as iodine are known to affect brain development and intellectual abilities, likewise changes in prenatal care, number of years in education, pollution, pandemics and technology all influence IQ, making it difficult to isolate the impact of a single factor. “We don’t act in a vacuum, and we can’t point to one thing and say, ‘That’s it,’” says Dworak.Still, while AI’s impact on overall intelligence is challenging to quantify (at least in the short term), concerns about cognitive offloading diminishing specific cognitive skills are valid – and measurable.Studies have suggested that the use of AI for memory-related tasks may lead to a decline in an individual’s own memory capacityWhen considering AI’s impact on our brains, most studies focus on generative AI (GenAI) – the tool that has allowed us to offload more cognitive effort than ever before. Anyone who owns a phone or a computer can access almost any answer, write any essay or computer code, produce art or photography – all in an instant. There have been thousands of articles written about the many ways in which GenAI has the potential to improve our lives, through increased revenues, job satisfaction and scientific progress, to name a few. In 2023, Goldman Sachs estimated that GenAI could boost annual global GDP by 7% over a 10-year period – an increase of roughly$7tn.The fear comes, however, from the fact that automating these tasks deprives us of the opportunity to practise those skills ourselves, weakening the neural architecture that supports them. Just as neglecting our physical workouts leads to muscle deterioration, outsourcing cognitive effort atrophies neural pathways.One of our most vital cognitive skills at risk is critical thinking. Why consider what you admire about a British author when you can get ChatGPT to reflect on that for you?Research underscores these concerns.Michael Gerlichat SBS Swiss Business School in Kloten, Switzerland, tested 666 people in the UK and found a significant correlation between frequent AI use and lower critical-thinking skills – with younger participants who showed higher dependence on AI tools scoring lower in critical thinking compared with older adults.Similarly, a study by researchers atMicrosoft and Carnegie Mellon Universityin Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania surveyed 319 people in professions that use GenAI at least once a week. While it improved their efficiency, it also inhibited critical thinking and fostered long-term overreliance on the technology, which the researchers predict could result in a diminished ability to solve problems without AI support.“It’s great to have all this information at my fingertips,” said one participant in Gerlich’s study, “but I sometimes worry that I’m not really learning or retaining anything. I rely so much on AI that I don’t think I’d know how to solve certain problems without it.” Indeed, other studies have suggested that the use of AI systems for memory-related tasksmay lead to a decline in an individual’s own memory capacity.This erosion of critical thinking is compounded by the AI-driven algorithms that dictate what we see on social media. “The impact of social media on critical thinking is enormous,” says Gerlich. “To get your video seen, you have four seconds to capture someone’s attention.” The result? A flood of bite-size messages that are easily digested but don’t encourage critical thinking. “It gives you information that you don’t have to process any further,” says Gerlich.By being served information rather than acquiring that knowledge through cognitive effort, the ability to critically analyse the meaning, impact, ethics and accuracy of what you have learned is easily neglected in the wake of what appears to be a quick and perfect answer. “To be critical of AI is difficult – you have to be disciplined. It is very challenging not to offload your critical thinking to these machines,” says Gerlich.Wendy Johnson, who studies intelligence at Edinburgh University, sees this in her students every day. She emphasises that it is not something she has tested empirically but believes that students are too ready to substitute independent thinking with letting the internet tell them what to do and believe.Without critical thinking, it is difficult to ensure that we consume AI-generated content wisely. It may appear credible, particularly as you become more dependent on it, but don’t be fooled. A 2023 study inScience Advancesshowed that, compared with humans, GPT-3 chat not only produces information that is easier to understandbut also more compelling disinformation.Why does that matter? “Think of a hypothetical billionaire,” says Gerlich. “They create their own AI and they use that to influence people because they can train it in a specific way to emphasise certain politics or certain opinions. If there is trust and dependency on it, the question arises of how much it is influencing our thoughts and actions.”AI’s effect on creativity is equally disconcerting. Studies show that AI tends to help individuals produce more creative ideas than they can generate alone. However, across the whole population,AI-concocted ideas are less diverse, which ultimately means fewer “Eureka!” moments.Sternberg captures these concerns in a recent essay in theJournal of Intelligence: “Generative AI is replicative. It can recombine and re-sort ideas, but it is not clear that it will generate the kinds of paradigm-breaking ideas the world needs to solve the serious problems that confront it, such as global climate change, pollution, violence, increasing income disparities, and creeping autocracy.”To ensure that you maintain your ability to think creatively, you might want to consider how you engage with AI – actively or passively.Research by Marko Müller from the University of Ulmin Germany shows a link between social media use and higher creativity in younger people but not in older generations. Digging into the data, he suggests this may be to do with the difference in how people who were born in the era of social media use it compared with those who came to it later in life. Younger people seem to benefit creatively from idea-sharing and collaboration, says Müller, perhaps because they’re more open with what they share online compared with older users, who tend to consume it more passively.Alongside what happenswhileyou use AI, you might spare a thought to what happensafteryou use it. Cognitive neuroscientist John Kounios from Drexel University in Philadelphia explains that, just like anything else that is pleasurable, our brain gets a buzz from having a sudden moment of insight, fuelled by activity in our neural reward systems. These mental rewards help us remember our world-changing ideas and also modify our immediate behaviour, making us less risk averse – this is all thought to drive further learning, creativity and opportunities. But insights generated from AI don’t seem to have such a powerful effect in the brain. “The reward system is an extremely important part of brain development, and we just don’t know what the effect of using these technologies will have downstream,” says Kounios. “Nobody’s tested that yet.”There are other long-term implications to consider. Researchers have only recently discovered thatlearning a second language, for instance, helps delay the onset of dementia for around four years, yet in many countries, fewer students are applying for language courses. Giving up a second language in favour of AI-powered instant-translation apps might be the reason, but none of these can – so far – claim to protect your future brain health.As Sternberg warns, we need to stop asking what AI can doforus and start asking what it is doingtous. Until we know for sure, the answer, according to Gerlich, is to “train humans to be more human again – using critical thinking, intuition – the things that computers can’t yet do and where we can add real value.”We can’t expect the big tech companies to help us do this, he says. No developer wants to be told their program works too well; makes it too easy for a person to find an answer. “So it needs to start in schools,” says Gerlich. “AI is here to stay. We have to interact with it, so we need to learn how to do that in the right way.” If we don’t, we won’t just make ourselves redundant, but our cognitive abilities too.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)The ObserverChatbotsComputingChatGPTGooglefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But can you analyse an athlete’s state of mind, based on their on-pitch body language?In an era when football is increasingly leaning on data to demonstrate physical attributes, statistics offering an accurate indication of a player’s psychological qualities, such as emotional control and leadership, are harder to come by. But Premier League clubs including Brighton are using a technique intended to help in that regard with selection and recruitment.Thomas Tuchel made headlines by tellingEngland’s players to communicate moreafter he evaluated their interactions during the final of Euro 2024, but counting the number of times players gesture or talk to each other on the pitch tells only part of the mental battle being played out.Yaw Amankwah, a former top-flight defender in Norway and Denmark, is at the centre of the push for better psychological evaluation of players. “When you take your eyes off the ball, it’s a treasure trove of information,” says Amankwah, who also works as a pundit. “Once you disregard tactics and just look at the psychological part of the game and players through this lens, it’s impossible to unsee it. It’s the subtle, nonverbal messages that show if players are very confident, aggressive or in their own bubble.”View image in fullscreen‘Once you disregard tactics and just look at the psychological part of the game, it’s impossible to unsee it,’ says Yaw Amankwah.Photograph: Sipa/AlamyAmankwah uses the example of a player who blasts a 20-yard shot into the stands and, 45 seconds later, receives a consoling pat on the back from a passing teammate. It is a fleeting moment that might be missed – or overlooked – by fans, media and even coaching teams, but, to a former professional, it illustrates a quiet sense of leadership. “I know the cues and small behaviours that you have to learn in order to function effectively on a football pitch,” Amankwah says.Over the past six years, he has worked with the psychology professor Geir Jordet, analysing thousands of hours of match footage from across the world, including videos of every player in the Premier League and Women’s Super League. The result is a dataset containing more than 100,000 unique observations, which has enabled the duo – via their company, Inside Out Analytics – to create a proxy ranking of players across different types of behaviour.The information can demonstrate, say, whether a defender’s emotional control, compared with opponents’ and teammates’ in the same position, is in the top 5% of those players in the league. As Jordet puts it: “It’s a new world that opens up. The map gives clubs a benchmark and that’s critical because you can look at certain behaviours, and you can count how many times they occur in certain situations, but most are still going to be blind to what that means.“It’s hard to figure out their exact meaning, but we’re no longer blind, because we can say that for this type of behaviour, in this situation, if you compare all the players in this player’s position in the Premier League, this player is in the 90th percentile or in the 10th percentile.”Bayern Munich are one of several leading clubs to have trialled the platform, employing the technology during Julian Nagelsmann’s time as head coach. “Every department [in a club] puts numbers on the table, but psychology doesn’t,” says the former Bayern psychologist Max Pelka, who now works with Brighton. “There are aspects of psychology that can be measured – there are a lot of cognitive diagnostics out there – but they’re not that close to [what is happening] on the pitch.”View image in fullscreenMax Pelka (left) and Julian Nagelsmann worked together at RB Leipzig before moving to Bayern Munich.Photograph: DPA/AlamyPelka – who followed Nagelsmann from RB Leipzig to Bayern – worked with Jordet and Amankwah to analyse about 25 Bayern games during the second half of the 2022-23 season.After each match, Pelka would boil down detailed observations of each player’s posture, head movements and hand gestures – to name a few elements of body language monitored by Amankwah’s analysis team – to a one-page summary of the side’s psychological performance, which he would present to the coaching department. The data was among several sets of information which Nagelsmann and his assistants would consider before picking a side.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Pelka says: “There was a defender who was very interested in the findings … how to use his body language to lead and show others the way [to play]. It doesn’t happen overnight, but if you have a starting point of how things look on the pitch, it’s much easier to work on it.”Pelka is using some of the techniques he employed in Munich to analyse Brighton’s players’ on-pitch behaviour. Although he hasn’t monitored Fabian Hürzeler’s squad as frequently, the key planks of the process are the same, with Brighton’s head coach reviewing summaries of his side’s key psychological “actions”.Jordet and Amnankwah are increasingly using artificial intelligence rather than the manual coding that consumed much of the pair’s time. “Soon, we’ll have very little limit on how many teams we can analyse at any point in time … and then we can actually start to inform clubs about prospective new signings, highlighting someone that they were not aware of before or confirm or challenge an emerging decision,” Jordet says. “We could say: ‘Yes, this seems to be a good signing,’ or: ‘From our perspective, given these metrics, there’s a big red flag here and that’s something you may want to look into.’”Explore more on these topicsFootballThe ObserverArtificial intelligence (AI)Brighton & Hove AlbionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then I could plaster it with those “I bought this before Elon went mad” stickers, shamefacedly sell it at a loss and write a performative social media post about no longer being able to stomach the guilt of driving it around town. But as I don’t actually own a car, let alone a Tesla, I’ve felt unable to add my voice to the anti-Musk and anti-Trump protests gaining momentum around the world. Until now.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Of course, I will not be travelling to the US at any time soon. As former US secretary of laborRobert Reichwrites, why reward Trump’s America with my tourist dollars? But as I wasn’t planning to visit America, this doesn’t feel like a sacrifice, let alone a meaningful one. So the appearance of the #BoycottUSA movement has arrived at just the right time.Here is a campaignI can sign up to wholeheartedly. But I plan to go further than the one in three French people who are merely “avoiding” American products. Instead, I am proposing a total purge, ridding my house and my life of any taint of Americana. Not a Marlboro will be smoked, no Manhattan drunk, no foot stomped to the exuberant refrain of Cotton Eye Joe.These are, of course, mere gestures. Eschewing Marlboros and line-dancing is no sacrifice at all, though turning down a perfect Manhattan will be tough. I know that if I am going to be serious about de-Americanisingeverything,I have to get systematic about it. There will need to be research and auditing, rules and considerations and caveats and, above all, self-control, commitment and discipline.So, to keep myself on this righteous path and to help others similarly appalled by America’s descent into authoritarian plutocracy cleanse their lives of Yankee fare, I offer the rules of the game and an incomplete review of everything that I will be replacing with un-American alternatives.The rules1No American product may be bought or American service used. No exceptions. (But what about Apple, I hear you say. They have rejected calls to remove DEI policies! What about Patagonia? They are the good guys! Yes, and yes, of course some American companies – and some Americans – are good. But “whataboutery” won’t get us anywhere.)2If an American product has been previously bought, it can be used until it breaks, at which point it cannot be replaced by another American product. (Note: if a working product, eg an iPhone, uses American services, eg iCloud storage, it must be immediately replaced by a product that does not require American services to work.) Similarly, one is allowed to keep any existing American friends, but making new American friends is verboten.3If an artist (a writer, musician, film-maker, actor, whatever) is American, their work is taboo. It is acceptable to experience American art on existing physical formats but, as per Rule 2, these cannot be replaced once defunct. (To support American artists is to support the American Military-Media-Entertainment Complex. Sorry, Bruce.)4It’s not a principle if it doesn’t cost you something.So, now that we are clear about the rules, it’s time to apply them, starting with the trickiest area of all: technology. You might imagine me to be a typical metropolitan media douche, swanning around coffee shops with my bestickered MacBook Air while using my Apple Watch to pay for my £4.30 flat whites. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. I actually swan around coffee shops with an unstickered Google Chromebook and I use a Garmin running watch to pay for my £4.50 pour over, thank you very much.But whether you are an Apple fanatic or a Google diehard, replacing hardware and software is going to be painful, costly and complicated, and will involve unfamiliar systems with steep learning curves. It is possible to replace US hardware with Chinese or Taiwanese equivalents but as these come with their own moral issues, I’ve forced myself to look for European devices, which makes for a harder, but more self-congratulatory journey. Just imagine how smug it will feel to have mastered a whole new operating system on a European laptop and to send an inaugural text message on a sustainable European phone!So, I will be replacing my Google Pixelbook Go with a GermanTuxedo InfinityBook Pro 14running its own version of the Linux (developed at the University of Helsinki) operating system. My Google Pixel 8a Android phone is going to be swapped out with a Franco-DutchMurena Fairphone 5running the “deGoogled” /e/OS and my American Garmin will be replaced by a FinnishSuuntowatch.But even avoiding US tech brands does not guarantee that a phone or laptop will be completely un-American. Fairphone uses soldering paste made out of recycled tin (good!) made for them by Connecticut-based MacDermid Alpha (bad!). And their phone chips are made in Asia by US-based Qualcomm. Tuxedo does not specify where its components come from, though it says that the vast majority are made in Asia and imported to Germany where its laptops are assembled. Surprisingly, it turns out that phones and laptops are complex devices with many, many, many components and also the global supply chain is very complicated indeed. Don’t lift the rock if you’re squeamish about what you might find underneath.With hardware mostly sorted, it’s time to get familiar with open source software, as I won’t be able to use the vast majority of apps that come with Apple or Android devices. No more Gmail, Google Maps or Apple Photos. Instead, I’ll be switching toProton Mail(based in Switzerland, home of lots of privacy-focused apps),OpenStreetMap(or UK-basedCitymapperfor urbanites) andImmich, a photo library that I’ll be hosting myself instead of paying Apple or Google for the privilege. Video calling with Zoom and Google Meet can be supplanted by NorwegianWhereby,while word processing, spreadsheets and presentations will all be handled byLibreOffice, part of the non-profit Berlin-basedDocument Foundation.Au revoirMicrosoft Teams, you will not be missed.Never again will I groove to Marvin, Aretha or Otis. Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, time to saddle up and ride into the sunsetAs anyone who has tried to switch from Android to iPhone or Mac to PC knows, familiarity is a major barrier to change. Abandoning tools and services I’ve used for years (decades, in the case of Gmail) and learning new systems, new terminology and new shortcuts is tedious, expensive and frustrating. I’ve always thought of myself as “good at the internet”, but trying to work out how to get public transport directions in OpenStreetMap or make a LibreOffice document look as if it has been designed by somebody with working eyes is making me feel tired and old.When it comes to social media, things get really tricky. I obviously deleted my X/Twitter account long ago but, according to Rule 1, I will have to delete my Bluesky profile and turn to its nerdier cousinMastodon. Hey, at least I won’t stumble across Piers Morgan there. And a smaller, less shouty social network that doesn’t demand much attention reduces the risk of making any new American friends or contacts (Rule 2). I’m sure there are plenty of good, well-meaning Americans out there sharing good and interesting insights, reckonings, gifs and feelings, so please don’t think I’m being rude if I block, mute or ignore you until 2028. I’m just following the rules.YouTube is, I fear, fairly irreplaceable. I could up my TikTok usage (it’s Chinese-owned) but as the point of this whole exercise is to make me a better person, will that really work? I’ve triedDailymotion(the French YouTube) and it simply doesn’t scratch that itch. There’s just so much less of it. If your hope is that a French YouTube will be infused with subtle yet sophisticated Gallic charm, then I am going to have to disappoint you.Netflix, Apple TV+, Disney+ and Prime Video will all have to go.ArrivederciThe Studio, Reacher and Slow Horses.HastaluegoSeinfeld repeats, Breaking Bad binges and The Good Place water cooler moments. But thankfully we still have the Great British Broadcasting Corporation and its tip-top iPlayer service. I haven’t watched EastEnders since the early 1990s. I’ll bet there’s been plenty going on in Albert Square for me to catch up on.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But remember, no streaming of American music – we don’t want royalties falling into the wrong hands. On Spotify you can block artists so they don’t appear in your recommendations. Setting up this block list will be the cultural self-flagellation that demonstrates total devotion to the cause. Never again will I groove around the kitchen to Marvin, Aretha or Otis. Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris, time to saddle up and ride into the sunset. No, Alexa, do not play Not Like Us by Kendrick Lamar from Spotify. This one’s going to hurt.And then there’s Amazon. Finding alternatives to “the world’s most customer-centric company” is a non-negotiable. While Waterstones has a US investment group as its majority shareholder, there are plenty of other places that will post a book to you includinguk.bookshop.org, which gives a significant proportion of its profits to local independent booksellers. Non-book items will require more shopping around, more patience and will probably come at a higher cost, but at least I’ll be sleeping with a clear conscience while I wait.Next up is a room-by-room property inspection to see where further American invaders can be eradicated. The kitchen is a battlefield as a small number of giant US food conglomerates own a great many European brands, all of which must now be purged from fridges and cupboards. Is there anything more English than Gary Lineker flogging a salt and vinegar crisp? Think again, for Walkers is owned by Frito-Lay, itself owned by PepsiCo. No Wotsit, Quaver, Frazzle or Monster Munch (sob!) shall pass my lips again.View image in fullscreen‘According to Rule 2, I can wear my Converse All Stars until they fall apart, at which point they will be replaced by German Pumas.’Photograph: Pål Hansen/The GuardianThe list of prohibited foods is lengthy and surprising, and it will be necessary to get familiar with all the brands owned and managed byKraft Heinz,General MillsandMondelézto ensure that no proscribed product accidentally gets into the shopping trolley. It’s going to be easiest to print out a list of these products (only a dozen or so pages in 9pt type) to take to the supermarket on every shop. And printouts have the benefit of being able to be waved aggressively at anyone I spot reaching for the Alvalle Gazpacho (made in Spain, owned byPepsiCo) in Waitrose.In the cupboard under the sink and in the bathroom, I thought it would simply be a question of replacing anything fromProcter & Gamblewith the equivalent item from Anglo-Dutch Unilever. Begone Ariel, Oral B and Olay.WilkommenPersil, Signal and Dove. But as Unilever owns a huge number of US brands, again it becomes a question of a forensic inspection of the labels and an encyclopedic knowledge of American corporate hierarchies. I might have to follow the example of my French mother-in-law who makes her own washing liquid by blending Savon de Marseille, warm water and bicarbonate of soda. I don’t think this is a political gesture, though with the French you can never be sure. For my part, I will be washing only in the finestEau de Thames Waterfollowed by a quick spritz of Unilever-owned Brut.As someone who hasn’t worn a pair of Levi’s since Nick Kamen left the scene, a boycott of American clothing is barely a challenge. According to Rule 2, I can wear my Converse All Stars until they fall apart, at which point they will be replaced by German Pumas or Italian Diadoras. Zara (Spanish) and Uniqlo (Japanese) will dress me from head to toe, though strangely most men’s underpants brands do seem to be American. Thank God for Marks & Spencer.Then, just as I light a Gauloise to celebrate the complete decontamination of my life, I come across three issues that make melet out a Homer Simpson-esque “Doh!” in frustration. First, it is not possible to find a bank that doesn’t use either Visa or Mastercard to process payments and every time a payment is processed, one of these two US businesses gets a cut. Stockholm-based Klarna might be a non-US option for some online payments and there is talk of the European Central Bank issuing “digital euros” later this decade, but I doubt I’ll be able to take advantage of it here in Brexity Blighty. So, short of keeping wads of notes stashed in the mattress and shopping only in stores that still take cash, there doesn’t seem any practical way of deAmericanising this particular aspect of modern life.The case for boycotting the United States | Robert ReichRead moreAnd in further fiscal frustration, if your pension plan is anything like mine, it is likely to hold a mixture of investments including UK, European and US stocks. I asked the very sensible person who administers my pension whether I could get rid of my US investments and was told it is possible, “although probably rather unwise as divesting completely from US holdings reduces geographic diversification, which could impact risk-adjusted returns”. I suspect in this context “rather unwise” actually means “Does this idiot even understand how money works?” Call me a coward, but incurring the wrath of my wife by jeopardising her future financial security is too great a risk for me to contemplate.And then I was reminded of something that has made me doubt whether I can do any of this at all. Because Arsenal – the football team I support and read about and think about and care about a little too much – are, like nine other Premier League clubs, American-owned. And not just any American, but shopping mall developer, married-to-Walmart-heiress all-American American. Dang! Even if the nearest British-owned team were not our hated rivals Tottenham, I just can’t switch allegiance. I’m going to have to give up football itself. But not now, not yet, not with the excitement of a European quarter-final so fresh in the memory. Sorry.So, yeah, I’m keeping my bank account, my pension, my football team (for now) and, I hope, my marriage. This exercise is not about rejecting the modern world or the pleasures and comforts of modern life. It’s about turning away from America and turning towards Europe. One day I’d love to go back to the States and eat a cheeseburger in a Brooklyn dive bar, toasting old friends and new with shots of rail bourbon in the Land of the Free. But not for the time being, not under the current regime.So pour me aRob Roy, give me a packet of Marmite-flavoured peanuts and sit me down in front of Antiques Roadshow, I’ll be grand. Up on the moral high ground life is sweet, if a little lonely. See, my family refuse to close their WhatsApp accounts and join me on Telegram and I think they might be talking about me behind my back. I get lost all the time and no one is liking or sharing the photos I post toPixelfed. And I really miss my friends and our group chats, miss the videos and in-jokes and playlists we share, the things that have nourished our relationships over the years.But it’s OK. It’s not a principle if it doesn’t cost you something.Explore more on these topicsShoppingConsumer spendingRetail industryFood & drink industryTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Imagine the backlash if he were a womanSat 19 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Apr 2025 19.17 EDTShareElon Musk’s never-ending daddy issuesI regret to inform you that, once again, we are all being forced to think aboutElon Musk’s gonads. Musk, who has had at least 14 children with four women, hasn’t officially launched a new mini-Musk for a while, but theWall Street Journalhas just dropped some disturbing details about the billionaire’s well-publicized breeding fetish.You’ll be familiar with some of these details already. By now we all know that Musk seems to think that the only way to save western civilization is if people like him have as many children as possible. And you’ve probably read the New York Times report which alleges that Musk, who likes preaching what he practices in regards to populating the world, has a habit of wandering around offering hissperm to strangers.What you might not know, however, is that Musk is so committed to this idea of himself as a superhero saving the universe that, even in private conversations, he apparently speaks like he is a character in a poorly written sci-fi novel. According to the Journal, Musk reportedly refers to his children as a “legion” and has been brainstorming ways to breed more efficiently.“To reach legion-level before the apocalypse we will need to use surrogates,” he reportedly said to Ashley St Clair, the mother of one of his children, in a text message seen by the newspaper.Surrogacy can often be a complex ethical issue. Not in this case. Musk appears to view women as nothing more than walking wombs he can use to further his own narcissistic agenda. Ethics aside for a moment, one has to wonder why a man who styles himself as a tech guru can’t figure out a faster way to pop out offspring than surrogacy. At the very least, I’m surprised that Musk hasn’t yet followed the lead of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who reportedly had visions of using his ranch in New Mexico as a base where women would be inseminated with his sperm andgive birth to his babies. But that may come later, I suppose. All the money that Doge, Musk’s pet government project, has cut from libraries andmedical researchmight, at this very moment, be getting funneled into an Official Institute of Accelerated Insemination.While Musk may not have a birthing ranch (yet), he does own a very expensive social network which, according to the Journal, he’s been using to solicit more baby mamas. Musk has apparently been engaging with the cryptocurrency influencer Tiffany Fong on X, sending so many followers her way that she earned $21,000 over a two-week period from the revenue-sharing programs for creators on the platform. Once she was enjoying how lucrative it was to be on his good side, the billionaire asked Fong if she was interested inbirthing his child. You know, as you do. Fong politely declined and Musk swiftly unfollowed her, causing her X-related income to drop.We all know that Musk has very thin skin. How has he responded to the Journal’s embarrassing reporting? Honestly, in an unusually restrained fashion. Nobody has been sent to El Salvador (yet), no reporters have been doxed. Musk has just dismissed the piece as scurrilous gossip. On Tuesday he tweeted “TMZ >> WSJ”. And, in normal circumstances, Musk would be correct that, as long as all parties involved are consenting adults, his private life is no one else’s business. But Musk is not your run-of-the-mill rich guy, is he? I don’t thinkDonald TrumporJD Vancebelieve in very much other than their own advancement. But Musk is an ideologue: he’s inserted himself into the top levels of government and is busy rearranging the US according to his worldview. Understanding all the ins and outs of this worldview is now very much a matter of public interest.It’s also illuminating, I think, to look at the sort of coverage Musk’s shenanigans get, particularly in the conservative press. While people love gawking at Musk, he’s still widely seen as an eccentric genius. Even the headline of the Wall Street Journal piece: “The tactics Elon Musk uses to manage his ‘Legion’ of babies – and their mothers”, seemed to suggest admiration for his multitasking. I’ve offered up thisthought experimentbefore, but just humor me again and imagine a world where a woman acted like Musk. You can’t, can you? She’d be eviscerated on Fox News. There’d be a million thought pieces about what a terrible mother she was. Absolutely nobody would consider her a genius and she certainly wouldn’t be advising the president. There is perhaps no better embodiment of gendered double standards than Musk. And now he’s set on exporting those double standards to Mars.Give Fatima Hassouna a ‘loud death’Being a journalist in Gaza is a death sentence, with Israel apparently set on ensuring a completemedia blackoutof the ongoinggenocide. On Wednesday, days before her wedding,Fatima Hassouna, a young photojournalist who is the subject of a new documentary, became one of the latest journalists to be killed by Israel. A strike on her home killed her along with 10 members of her family, including her pregnant sister. “If I die, I want a loud death,” Hassouna had written on social media. “I don’t want to be just breaking news, or a number in a group, I want a death that the world will hear.”This is what it means to be Palestinian: to have to beg the world to care about you. To have cowards avert your eyes as you are massacred. To have the architects of your annihilationtrot around the worldbeing treated as VIPs by countries that once pretended to care about human rights.Self-identifying ‘hot girls’ are mobilizing to elect a progressive as New York City mayorIfully endorse this.Young women now binge-drink more than young menWhile gen Z may drink less than previous generations, the gender gap in risky drinking has been narrowing. A new study finds that women aged 18-25 are now actually drinking slightly more thanmen the same age.Sudan: two years of war and shameful international neglect“Last week, Amnesty International released anew investigationfinding the Rapid Support Forces committed widespread sexual violence, including rape, gang rape and sexual slavery, amounting to possible crimes against humanity,” Amnesty International’s Erika Guevara Rosas said in astatement marking the two-year anniversaryof the outbreak of Sudan’s civil war. “Despite these atrocities, the world has largely chosen to remain passive. Alarmingly, the UN Security Council has failed to implement a comprehensive arms embargo on Sudan to halt theconstant flow of weaponsfueling these heinous crimes.”A crack in the manosphere: Joe Rogan’s guests are revoltingI chuckled a lot atthis headline.Everyone is making fun of Katy Perry for her little space trip, even Wendy’sThe fast-food chain is refusing to apologize to the singer for a tweet suggesting she should besent back to space.

Donald Trump’s aggressive policies towards foreigners build on Bukele’s infamous iron fist crackdown against criminal gangs: it’s apolitical toolkitthat leverages anti-establishment anger to justify an authoritarian slide. In deployingstrongman tacticsto address social concerns, both leaders also cultivate a chilling culture of fear.Bukele’s visit this week to Washington DC – where Trump urged him to build more prisons in order toreceive US citizensconvicted of crimes – showcased the results of the alliance: the internationalisation of the Bukele method.El Salvador has nowbeen undera “state of exception” – which suspends aspects of the constitution and grants the government extraordinary powers of detention – for three years. So long that the international media has largely stopped reporting each new monthly extension passed by the legislature, which is overwhelmingly dominated by Bukele. According to the official narrative, suspended civil liberties are a paltry price to pay for the effective dismantling of the criminal groups that dominated everyday life in most of El Salvador. Indeed, official data indicates a dramaticallyreduced homicide rate, and widespread reports of a real freedom from the scourge of gang control.But the human cost is staggering: El Salvador now has thehighest incarceration ratein the world, and its prisoners, includingthousands of children, have been subjected tosystematic tortureand human rights violations. Nonetheless, Bukeleremains enormously popular, and he has become an aspirational figure for Latin American leaders across the ideological spectrum.Until Trump, none of Bukele’s would-be imitators had managed to get beyond rhetorical nods, vague plans to build enormous prisons, or sporadic declarations of states of emergency. What Trump has understood – perhaps instinctively – is that the key isn’t the policies themselves, but rather the sustained,brazen assaulton the rule of law,which in itself appears to be “doing something” about the problems.And like Bukele, Trump claims that the strategy is working. He can point to the fact thatmigrant campson theUS-Mexico borderhave emptied, and the flow of people across thetreacherous Darién Gaphuman highwayhas reversed course, as the cost of seeking asylum in a country that no longer grants it is, at least for now, too great.Yet these narratives are misleading. Militarising domestic security and conducting mass raids are only the most tweetable facets of Bukele’s strategy. His consolidation of power also involved controlling the legislature, co-opting the judiciary andsecretly negotiatingwith gang leaders. Indeed, in exchange for receiving more than 200 of Trump’s Venezuelan deportees, Bukelenegotiated the returnof MS-13 gang leaders, who experts say could have revealed details of negotiations the Salvadoran president denies having. Likewise, reduced numbers at the US southern border also reflects years of US pressure, by Democrat and Republican governments, on Mexico and Central American countries to deter migration.The judicial front could be a litmus test for Trump’s version of the Bukele method. In Brazil, the judiciary served as a counter to Jair Bolsonaro’s authoritarian slide. Perhaps US institutions, far more robust than El Salvador’s, will follow this path. In the US,courts have resistedparts of the deportation agenda, and the executive, in turn, has defied the judiciary. Cases involving the deportations to El Salvador could potentiallyspark a constitutional crisis, pitting the two branches of government against each other.But it might not matter. Trump’s real innovation has been to outsource the most egregious parts of his immigration crackdown, both to the private sector and to foreign actors and sites. This could, potentially, leave much of it beyond the reach of domestic courts. Private companies run deportation flights where some people have been shackled hand and foot, with no concern for their safety. Trump has made use of legal black holes like Guantánamo, and isadvancing towardsreappropriating military bases in Panamanian territory. El Salvador is not just an ally – it’s a penal colony, a back-office subcontractor.Thecase of Kilmar Ábrego Garcíaillustrates the human cost of the emerging Bukele-Trump method. TheSalvadoran man was deportedby US authorities due to what authorities later described as an “administrative error”. In a cynical back and forth, Trump and Bukele claim that Abrego García’s release from the prison is beyond their control. He is just one of the thousands arbitrarily detained and labeled as terrorists by both governments. This is not a byproduct, but rather an integral part of the approach, calculated to instil terror.How many more times will we see this?In March, a Venezuelan couple legally residing in Washington DC were detained in front of their children. Off camera,one child cries out: “They are taking him and he hasn’t done anything,” while a younger sibling simply sobs for their mother. Last month, plainclothes immigration agentsdetained Rümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish PhD student just outside Boston – apparently in retaliation for an op-ed she co-published in the Tufts Daily, calling for divestment from Israel.Security footage showsa hooded man seizing her hands as Öztürk screams in terror. Masked agents then escort her down a residential street, a scene that could have been lifted from the books explaining the breakdowns of Latin America’s democracies that I studied at that same university, just metres away from where Öztürk was disappeared. It can, indeed, happen here.Bukele has shown how a state of exception can be sustained not just through brute force, but by raising the cost of speaking out. Under his state of exception, anybody can be labeled a criminal and critics often are. Trump is following suit, his policies have already effectively limited freedom of expression for a class of people that must now stay silent for fear of being grabbed off the streets. WhatBukele and Trumphave both understood is that fear doesn’t just suppress resistance. It can be the foundation of a lasting new order.Jordana Timerman is a journalist based in Buenos Aires.

When “don’t know” responses are included, the percentage of staff dissatisfied with the handling of bullying and harassment falls; for example, in the toxicology unit it decreases from 69% to 58%, and in the Cavendish laboratory of physics from 58% to 32%. Overall, 23% of staff completed the survey. In addition, the university rejects claims of a “cover up”, saying the results were shared with departmental heads and in relevant committees before a freedom of information request was made (“Cambridge accused of a ‘grim culture of bullying’ as staff survey finally emerges”, 13 April, p8).An article (“The high price paid by former inmates of HMP Dartmoor”, 13 April, p22) said that Dartmoor Prison Museum had closed; it is in fact open seven days a week.A comment from Caroline Bennett from Sole of Discretion about the duty of wholesalers to source fish responsibly was misattributed to Charlotte Dawe from Sea Sisters (“Why the humble fish dish is on the crest of a wave”, 13 April, p40).Faux pas: the clue for 22 across in last week’s Speedy crossword (No. 1,540, p59) was “French author ofMadame Bovary(5,4)”.

But those of a more secular persuasion can also find themselves beguiled by the restorative zeitgeist of this celebratory time of year.In the northern hemisphere it’s spring, with its green shoots and brighter light. Down here, deep in the southern hemisphere, the transition is of a gentle autumnal splendour – of softer skies and a flourish of bronze in the deciduous treetops.Even for those of us who aren’t especially religious,Easterand the short holiday around it coincides with a captivating seasonal tranquillity. After a harsh southern summer the days finally shorten, the light is beset with a new milkiness, the air assumes a slight crispness and on the east coast at least, north of the New South Wales-Victoria border, the warm ocean currents remain.The long antipodean summer break is a distant memory, the year nearly a third done. We are weary. These few days of Easter are, for many of us, a time to exhale, to stop and be with family and friends.There’s none of the stressful freneticism and consumerism of Christmas, of bolting to the finish line while madly marking full-stops at the end of all those projects before the country shuts down until 26 January.As a kid in Melbourne I hated Good Friday. The most boring day of the year, I would say. The shops were shut. There was nothing on TV (remember, if you’re old enough, that there were but four channels, only free-to-air, and the programming was the Royal Children’s hospital appeal featuring the clownsZig and Zag, or wall-to-wall Christian religious services). There was church, of course. And the prospect of it again on Sunday.Sexy, covetable hot cross buns: Australia’s obsession with Easter treatsRead moreNow it’s my favourite day of the year precisely because so little happens and because it kicks off four days of enforced R & R,of quieter flight paths above and less hectic and noisy roads encircling us.The seasonal change is a delight. It always brings in me a mellowness and a desire to reflect that feels somehow spiritual, profoundly ethereal, albeit in a secular way. I’m not thinking about Jesus or praying to God or anyone else. And yet I find myself in the embrace of some sort of contemplative languor that brings me to the preoccupations of Christians and those of other religions: the existential meaning of it all, the finite nature of time, life – and always death. And, of course, those who are no longer here.I always dwell heavily on notions of fortune at this time of year amid the forced stoppage and the seasonal change that encourages such rumination.It’s the fortune – the pure blind luck – of birth, of being born here, and to be thankful for it. I don’t mean fortune in a self-satisfied, sometimes exclusionary, “this-is-the-best-country-in-the-world’’ kind of way (how that not-so-humble brag wears thin on me in thiselection campaign). No, it’s got nothing to do withpatriotismin any traditional Australian sense. I’m thinking about existential providence, of being delivered to a place whose residents aren’t slaughtered daily by invading armies or beset by famines or being consumed by creeping – or not so creeping – fascism.For all of that, whether through Christian ceremony or a nod to the universe.Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsEasterOpinionAustralian lifestyleReligioncommentShareReuse this content"

Long before the Brothers Grimm gave us Snow White’s usurping queen (and long before Gal Gadot’s toe-curling recent turn in the role), there was Medea, witch of classical myth. Medea is best remembered for killing her own children but, according to Ovid, she went on to acquire a stepson, the hero Theseus, and attempted to kill him too. (Poison, of course, and with an eye on his inheritance: Witchy stepmothering 101.)Two millennia after Ovid, modern women still let our lives be limited by such stories. A new survey says that43% of single mothersare deterred from dating other parents by “negative stereotypes of stepmothers portrayed in popular culture”; 37% explicitly cite the fear that their partners’ children will view them as a “wicked stepmother”. One should approach such a survey with caution – it is commissioned by a dating app for parents – but these findings are mirrored in academic studies the world over. A 2018 survey from New Zealand found that stepmothers altered their behaviour, fearful of setting boundaries with their stepchildren, for fear of the “wicked stepmother” tag.Not even royals are safe from this psychic shadow. When Prince Harry published his memoirSpare, he didn’t quite say, as tabloids claimed, that his father’s wife Camilla had proved a wicked stepmother. What he did say, talking of their first meeting, was: “I recall wondering, right before the tea, if she’d be mean to me. If she’d be like all the wicked stepmothers in storybooks. But she wasn’t.” Plenty of children share Harry’s naive preconceptions, particularly if they’ve grown up on Disney. A study from Anglia Ruskin University, published with last week’s dating survey, assessed 450 hours of classic TV and cinema to find that stepmothers are frequently depicted as “bossy”, “strict”, “neglectful”, “heartless” and “manipulative”.With Snow White, the Grimms introduced a stepmother to an oral tradition that usually featured a monstrous biological motherBlended families are not new. For much of history, given high maternal mortality in childbirth, fathers married a second time in hope of finding a woman to saddle with their existing childcare. Nonetheless, even the most self-sacrificing stepmothers are easy to hate. Forget practical considerations, like the threat a stepmother poses to your inheritance. She’s sleeping with your father. Weird. No wonder stepmothers must be witches. Snow White’s shape-shifting stepmother reveals the classic dichotomy. Only a love potion could have cast a spell on the loins of your benighted Dad; you can see the hag beneath.The good news for stepmothers is that we’re primed to hate our mothers just as much. When the Grimms codified Snow White, they introduced a stepmother to an oral tradition that usually featured a monstrous biological mother. In his 1976 treatise on fairytales,The Uses of Enchantment, the psychologist Bruno Bettelheim argued that the Grimms’ versions took off because their stepmother-heavy adaptations allowed children to physically “split” confused emotions about our biological mothers. Our innate love for a mother is expressed in the idealised, dead woman exemplified by Snow White’s late mother; our conflict with the real-life woman telling us to tidy our rooms by the “stepmother”.Dead woman, good; live woman, bad. So if you’re a mother looking to date, don’t let fear of being a wicked stepmother hold you back. Your partner’s teens can’t hate you more than your own inevitably will.Kate Maltby writes about theatre, politics and cultureskip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Unlike in many countries in Europe, where motorists, farmers and rightwing groups have been driving anti-climate action, the UK has long enjoyed a comfortable political consensus on the subject. But conditions for a greenlash are assembling.Most Britons still say theysupport climate efforts, but the price of decarbonising may at last be about tohit our wallets. Meanwhile, the Conservative party has come a long way since it sported a little green oak tree as its logo. Last month, Kemi Badenoch declared a full culture war against net zero, which she said couldn’t be achieved “without a serious drop in our living standards or by bankrupting us”.The UK is joining a global trend. Populist parties in Europe scored big victories last year, politicians opposed to climate action are gaining ground in Canada and Australia, and, most importantly, America has withdrawn from the Paris agreement. As international agreements break down, reasons to be selfish multiply. Why should other countries strain to preserve the planet as America steams ahead?Climate change has of course always been a collective action problem. This applies even to those at the sharp end. Australian bush fires linger in recent memory, yet there is a strong groundswellagainst climate actionin the country. That is not illogical: the fires were a consequence of global, not local, emissions – Australia could shave its carbon footprint to nothing and still be the victim of other countries’ carelessness. But it is an early warning. As the worst effects of climate change show up on our doorsteps, we may still find plenty of reasons not to act.As countries retrench, then, it might be time for activists to take another approach. Rightwing populists tend to be good at communicating the costs of climate policies; their opposition, by contrast, is not good at advertising the benefits. As altruistic arguments go out of fashion, we may need to make a self-interested case for going green.We could start with air pollution, correlated with carbon emissions. In the UK, bad air is estimated to cause up to43,000 deathsa year. City dwellers are accustomed to inhaling foul-smelling smog as they jog and open their front windows, but they are breathing in particles that wreak havoc on their bodies. Every few weeks, scientists find a new way in which it is messing with our health. Pollution is known to hurt the heart and lungs, butmore recent findingsinclude dementia, bladder cancer, childhood leukaemia, diabetes, cognitive delay, autoimmune diseases, osteoporosis, skin ageing, cataracts – these are the trade-offs for driving our belching vehicles.Meanwhile, fossil fuels are filling our homes with noxious gases. Domestic boilers seep nitrogen oxides, which inflame airways and trigger respiratory disease. Gas cookers are thought to contribute to3,928 early deathsa year in Britain, by triggering heart and lung conditions. Children in homes with gas stoves are 42% more likelyto have asthma.Traffic has more insidious effects, too. A surprising recent finding is the effectcontinuous noise has on health; living by a busy road causeslow-level stress, and, in the long term, that increases the risk of stroke, diabetes and blood clots. Too much exposure to traffic noise hurts children’s brain development. Cutting down traffic in cities will also make them better in other ways. Wherever city centres are pedestrianised, they flourish, with economic and social benefits. Walking and cycling is better for us.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Solar panels are becoming ever cheaper.Electric carswill soon be less dear than petrol and diesel ones, as battery prices continue to fall across the world and producers start to focus on the mass market. They are already cheaper to run. Better insulated homes and more heat pumps will lead to lower energy use. Energy security is another reason to switch to renewables: relying on imported fossil fuels makes countries vulnerable to geopolitical events beyond their control.A general rule: proponents of “good causes” tend to emphasise their moral case, but stone cold pragmatism can work better. Those advocating on behalf of prisoners, homeless people and drug addicts often try to appeal to public empathy, but this runs short, especially when times are hard. Better to appeal to self-interest. Treating prisoners badly makes the public less safe when they are released; fail to deal with homelessness and this will cost us when people must be kept in emergency housing. Stinginess with addiction treatment entrenches the problem, making addicts dependent on state provision. So too with climate change.And if the self-interest of individual countries does not yet perfectly align with preserving the planet, it will someday. The consequences are likely to be so catastrophic that any action to mitigate it will eventually be worthwhile. In the meantime, activists should apply pressure at the points where altruism and selfishness most overlap: a switch to electric vehicles, electric stoves and heat pumps will make us happier and healthier.Martha Gill is an Observer columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He was devout – he tried to go without food for 40 days in emulation of Jesus Christ, until a bishop friend talked him out of likely death. The unprecedented phantasmagoria that he designed in stone, iron and ceramic could be called miracles. He even suffered a form of martyrdom, being hit by a tram while apparently deep in thought about his most famous work, the church of Sagrada Família. It’s not quite the same as a burning at the stake or a fusillade of arrows or the other grisly ends of ancient saints, but has its own significance. Gaudí’s mission was to find spiritual meaning in a world transformed by industry and machines, of which the fatal tram might be considered a representative.Indefensible GillView image in fullscreenEric Gill’s Prospero and Ariel at Broadcasting House, central London, behind its new protective screen.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAOne man who was not a saint was the artistEric Gill, for whom Catholicism was no impediment to raping his daughters. His work can be seen in many churches and public places, including his 1932 sculpture ofProspero and Arielabove the entrance to the original Broadcasting House. The BBC, in response to hammer attacks by an angry member of the public, has nowput a transparent case over it, to protect it from further damage.This is surely the worst of both worlds – it compromises whatever integrity there may be of sculpture and architecture, while making the corporation look (again) like a defender of child abuse. Removal would have been a better option. While it is true that great art can transcend the sins of its makers, in Gill’s case there is too close a link between his evil as a person and his lubricious depictions of young nudes, for which he sometimes used his children as models. If you know anything about Gill, it’s hard to see this sculpture, of a naked boy standing against the legs of a clothed man, as innocent.Apocalypse when?View image in fullscreenRobert Redford and Mia Farrow portray Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan in the 1974 film of The Great Gatsby.Photograph: AllstarIt’s timely,The Great Gatsbybeing 100 years old, to recall a line from Daisy’s husband, Tom Buchanan. “If we don’t look out,” he says, “the white race will be – will be utterly submerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.” This is the position of current believers in the “great replacement” theory, and of writers of shrieking headlines in British newspapers to the effect that Muslim extremism is taking over. Which goes to show that the tendency of the privileged to believe themselves under mortal threat is always with us. The fact that, a century on, their “scientific” predictions of racial apocalypse have still not come true, should also give those rightwing snowflakes pause for thought. It won’t, of course.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s no reason to strip funding from themLola OkolosieAcross the country, there’s a demographic shift. This is a chance to reinvest in our threadbare education systemSat 19 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Apr 2025 12.46 EDTSharePrimary school offer day has become a bittersweet moment in many communities. While anxious parents will breathe a sigh of relief upon securing their first-choice school, the chance of success has increased asreception applications have continued to fall.Falling birthratesand the cost-of-living crisis driving families out of more expensive cities, such as London, has led to shortages in primary school application numbers. The result? Undersubscribed schools lose out, with those that are more popular filling their spaces.This year in London, where some of the country’s highest-performing schools are located, (96% arerated goodor outstanding by Ofsted), applications for reception placesfell by 2.1%. It is a worrying continuation of a downward trend. On Wednesday, nearly 88% of applicantssecured their first-choice school, compared with81.1% in 2014when records began.A starker illustration of the problem can be found inthe local authority of North East Lincolnshire. It hasbeen able to offerevery single applicant their first preference school. In the council’s almost breathless announcement of this news, it acknowledges “this is unprecedented” – and it speaks volumes.In London,declining demandhas resulted in the closure or mergers of schools,despite parent and teacher-ledcampaigns to keep them open.It is not only an urban issue. In rural communities, primary schoolsare often at the heart of community life – from summer fetes and after school clubs providing much needed wraparound care, to charity appeals and quick chats at the school gate. Closures, therefore, are making a devastating impact. The county of North Yorkshirehas more rural schoolsthan any other part of England; ithas had to close34 primary schools since 2018, more than anywhere else in England over the preceding six years.Driven by falling enrolment and the financial strain that ensues, the closure of a primary school is a blow to families, and a loss of employment for the school meal supervisors, caretakers, teachers and teaching assistants who make up its staff body.As pupil numbers shrink, so too haveschool budgets in real terms. For the last financial year, the Department for Education (DfE) acknowledged that the funding which goes to mainstream schoolshas risen byapproximately 7.1%. In the same breath, the DfE’s technical noteunabashedly estimates that nationally schools’ costs actually rose by 7.7%. In a dispiriting summation, the DfE accepts that this means our schools have been given £250m less than it costs to run them.As has been the case since the advent of Tory austerity, headteachers are forced tomake impossible choices. Are they to cut teaching staff or reduce vital support services needed for pupils with additional needs in order to make their already strained resources stretch further?These cuts are landingat arguably the worst possible time – unprecedented numbers of children are seeking mental health support, persistent absence is at record highs and the demand for education, health and care planshas risenby as much as 50% in some councils in the past 12 months.Despite a refusal to scrap the two-child benefit cap, the government insists it is on a “mission” tobreak down barriersto opportunity for every child. To do so, it vows to work hard to “see a sustained rise in school outcomes” that will build “young people’s life skills”. These are empty words without the ballast of funding needed to secure their worthy aims. Even the DfE concedes schools won’t be able to afford the 2.8% pay riseoffered to teacherswithout plugging the shortfall with that favoured euphemism for cuts – “efficiencies”. After years of austerity, where exactly is the “fat” schools are supposed to cut?The government could – were it visionary and daring – consider the suggestion of former general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Geoff Barton.Addressing this issueat the ASCL conference last year, Barton outlined how “population estimates predict that the number of pupils in England’s schools will fall by half a million over the next five years”. This, yes, could be viewed as a huge multi-billion pound saving. But, Barton proposed, “instead of raking this money back into the Treasury,” the government could alternatively see it as “a golden opportunity to put education on a more sustainable footing”.Viewed as a dividend to be reinvested into our underfunded education system, this demographic shift is a chance to raise per-pupil funding and increase the amount additionally given to schools for improving the educational outcomes of disadvantaged pupils. It is, to paraphrase Barton, a policy costing not a lot extra, but which would nonetheless “make a world of difference”. The question is whether this government has the mettle to allow its fiscal prudence to align with its touted quest for social justice.Our education system cannot weather further austerity, and falling pupil numbers should not be viewed as an opportunity to strip funding away from our children. The government must accept that a changing country requires a reimagined approach for a sustainable education system. Reinvesting in our children should be an easy choice to make. They are worth it.Lola Okolosie is an English teacher and writerExplore more on these topicsEducationOpinionSchool admissionsSchoolsPrimary schoolsLondoncommentShareReuse this content"

What’s in your #EasterBasket?Sat 19 Apr 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Apr 2025 13.16 EDTShareAs a child, I was keenly aware of the inequitable practices of the tooth fairy, Santa Claus and the so-calledEasterBunny. How could it be that my teeth were less valuable than Abbie Smith-Arthur’s? Why was my stocking sock-sized, and the Walter boys next door had novelty sacks the size of their sofa? For what reason did I get but one big Easter egg, and Bethany down the road got 11?If I was a child today, I would be even more confused (and radicalised), thanks to the relentless rise of “Eastermas”.More than quarter of British adultsnow buy Easter presents, giving their loved ones not only chocolate but flowers, toys and clothes. On TikTok, videos tagged #EasterBasket show the headphones, trainers, face creams, keyrings, hoodies, teddies and concert tickets that parents bestow upon their children – in short, more gifts than most people receive at Christmas. I won’t deny that it is nice to give each other nice things, but I fear the trend puts pressure on parents, and normalises a level of consumption that would perhaps have been unthinkable even a decade ago.Pop into any high street shop and you will see our current levels of capitalist egg-cess. John Lewis sells carrot-shaped string lights and bunny-shaped wreaths; for £10, you can geta snow globefeaturing two bunnies in a carrot car. Who among us doesn’t need a “plush chicken ballpoint pen“ from Flying Tiger, or egg-shaped salt and pepper shakers from Next? And nothing says “he is risen” like the £52 “Easter Luxury Beauty Box” from Boots, featuring “revitalising supreme youth power crème”.View image in fullscreen‘It’s a tradition in my family to dye and paint eggs.’It’s not that I think we shouldn’t go all out at Easter. My mum has long hung little decorations on an “Easter tree” in our dining room – and she has a wooden bowl of hand-painted eggs passed down from her own mother. But I do worry that the £3 speckled egg-shaped side plates from Dunelm are not made to last in the same way. I fear that no one actually has the cupboard space for an£18 plant pot moulded like a bunnyin a mint green suit and matching top hat. It’s hard not to think of this stuff as landfill fodder that will be used once and never again.There’s an easy retort to my cynicism: let people enjoy things! We live in dark times and have to find happiness where we can! But who told you that joy could be bought? Who popularised the idea that shopping was self-care? Commenting on Eastermas, a senior seasonal manager at the supermarket Ocadotold the Guardian: “After a long winter, people are looking for something to celebrate.” How very considerate, then, that Ocado wants to help us celebrate with £18 pull-apart Easter crackers.I think we all need to scrutinise how happy spending actually makes us – and how long that feeling really lasts before we’re overwhelmed by the desire to declutter. If you Google “Easter toys”, the search engine reveals that other people have Googled: “What to get kids for Easter who have everything?” Might there be alternatives that make us happier than more stuff?Because no offence to Bethany down the road, but I’m certain I savoured my one Easter egg more than she did her 11. If you’re looking for a bit of happiness in these difficult times, instead of buying something new may I suggest an egg-tapping battle? It’s a tradition in my Polish family – and I believe many others – to dye and paint eggs (real ones, not glass ones from Oliver Bonas) and then smash them into each other to see whose cracks first. We never stuffed baskets with headphones and hoodies but instead filled them with bread, eggs, sausage and salt that would be blessed by a priest in a ceremony known as “święconka”. Of course, for many Easter is now secular, but that doesn’t mean it can’t still be meaningful, marked by what we create rather than what we consume.View image in fullscreen‘We cracked it open to discover a petrified purple-brown yolk that our dog inexplicably wanted to eat.’According to the market research company Kantar, 3.4 million Britons will spend £50 each on Easter gifts this year – and most of these people are parents. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that thesehigh spenders are alsomore likely to consume magazines and video on demand than the average adult. Easter baskets stuffed with gifts seem to be an American tradition that’s starting to cross the Atlantic thanks to social media. And it’s not just Easter: we are living in an era of extreme basketification, with Halloweenboo baskets, Christmas Eve boxes, 1 December boxes, Valentine’s baskets and burr baskets (for the winter) popularised on TikTok. Now, hardly a month can go by in which parents aren’t expected to fill a basket with tat for their kids.Six years ago, my brother and I broke an Easter decoration that has been in our family for decades. That makes it sound like a terrible accident: in fact, we deliberately smashed the black-and-red painted egg because we shook it and heard an ominous rattle within. Our curiosity got the better of us and we cracked it open to discover a petrified purple-brown yolk that our dog inexplicably wanted to eat. I get that breaking an heirloom – even if it is a literal rotten egg – is wasteful, but I’d still venture that it’s far less wasteful than a metre-long artificial grass table runner.It’s not that I’m recommending destroying decorations as a fun-filled, family Easter activity, but I think I do recommend filling your home with meaningful (if biohazardous) objects that are made to last. I recommend painting an egg or rolling it down a hill, and gluing fluffy yellow chicks to a bonne. And, of course, buying your child some chocolate eggs – just definitely less than 11.Amelia Tait is a freelance features writerExplore more on these topicsEasterOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Getting your garden ready for winter doesn’t have to mean costly trips to the garden centre and can instead be approached with resourcefulness and a focus on “closed systems” that minimise waste and encourage biodiversity.Save those seedsBelinda Thackeray, horticulturist and manager of Sydney City Farm, says now is a great time to turn plants on their last legs into a resource for the warmer months. “We try to save seeds off anything that we’ve got … it’s a really important part of the cycle.”Plan your menu, get kids involved and be realistic: how to pack better school lunchesRead moreThackeray explains there’s two common ways to make the most of annuals as their productive season ends. Firstly there’s wet production, “for things like your tomatoes, your cucumbers”. This method involves gathering the seeds of fleshy produce and soaking them in water. This process loosens the “jelly sack” that covers the seeds. After a couple of days that sack should slip off, along with any pathogens it might harbour. You’re left with a clean seed, ready to be dried and planted later in the year.The second method is useful for herbs and greens. As they go to seed, Thackeray suggests lopping off larger stems that are producing flowers or seed pods. “Then you put them upside down in a brown paper bag, and leave them to dry. As they do, all the little seeds will drop into the bottom of the bag for you to plant in the next warm season.”For ornamental annuals, seed saving can be as simple as giving the plant a good shake before ripping it out.Soil solutionsOnce you’ve collected seeds, the next thing to do is cut back perennials and clear out annuals. Thea Kerr, nursery manager at Ceres in Melbourne, says we need to be mindful of what we do with that foliage. “Some people opt for a chop and drop method, but that can be problematic with things like cucumbers which might have incurred a bit of fungal disease as it starts to get cooler.” Thackeray meanwhile cautions against letting any fruits or seeds get into a “cool compost” unless you’re hoping for a “sea of tomatoes or melons” when that compost gets scattered. “A nice hot compost” she says makes the seeds unviable and less of an issue.At this late stage of autumn, both Thackeray and Kerr suggest a“green manure”crop as an effective way to nourish the soil in areas you won’t be planting out during winter.Green manure seed mixes, which usually contain a mix of cereals and legumes, can be bought online and in most nurseries. The seeds are sown into cleared garden beds and then dug back into the soil right before they flower. This process enriches the soil and can even kill off harmful pathogens. From planting to decomposition, the process usually takes about 14 weeks, so doing this in May would see most gardens through until it’s time to get thingsready for spring.Dirty laundry: what really happens to your clothes when you donate them to charity?Read moreIf you do plan on planting, a good homemade compost or fertiliser and mulching is essential. As the temperatures cool, mulch is particularly important, says Thackeray: “Putting down mulch is like putting down a blanket, it keeps the soil nice and warm and helps the plants to get going.”What to plant?When it comes to winter crops, Thackeray says “things like broccoli, broccolini, kale, lots of varieties of peas, radishes, beetroots, carrots, coriander” are on her list. But Kerr reminds us that – after climate suitability – the most important consideration when planting crops is what you actually enjoy eating.Thackeray also suggests making the most of pruning: “As you give your perennials their autumn haircut, you can then also take those little pieces and then grow some new plants.”With “shrubby things” such as lavender, grevilleas and rosemary, Thackeray recommends “chopping off a piece of plant about 10 to 15cm long, where the top of it is floppy but it has a bit of hard stem. You leave the top one-third of the leaves and strip off all of the others.” Next, you’ll make a nice little hole with a pencil or chopstick and slide half that stem into the ground. “Then you just need to keep it moist and it will grow roots. It works a treat at the moment.”Keep it movingThackeray says that autumn can be the perfect time to break up rhizomes and tubers and redistribute them before the cold sets in. “Because they’ve finished their major growth phase it’s a really good time to move them because they’ll have some time to establish themselves in their new home before they go dormant for winter.” Think cannas, lilies, dahlias and their cousins.Bring in the bugsGetting some pollinators in your garden over the winter is another good idea. “Bringing in insects helps with pollinating the plants, but also helps with pest and disease management,” Thackeray says, recommending the classics such as calendulas, violas, pansies and poppies. Kerr also says autumn is an ideal time to get some flowering natives in, which will increase biodiversity and keep your local ecosystems healthy for years to come with very little maintenance.Explore more on these topicsGardensChange by degreesEthical and green livingShareReuse this content"

My father is from a royal family in Nigeria, so I interpreted it that way. Remarkably, she was right: I went on to play King Pelasgus, Henry VI, Martin Luther King and Seretse Khama.My earliest memoryis sitting on my dad’s shoulders as he walked down Balham High Street in London. I was eating a cream puff, watching the sugar fall into his hair. I can still smell and taste the cream. It felt magical, both the longest and the shortest walk imaginable.We movedfrom the UKto Nigeria,where I attended a military-style boarding school for three years. There were lashings and I was made to cut an entire field with a cutlass. Those formative years were character-building and made me value the wisdom of elders, but the idea of subjecting my own children to that is inconceivable.When we returnedto the UK, we lived in a hostel for a time. Mum was coping with a lot of challenges, but she was a joyful person and always made our environment feel like we were kings again.My wife[actor Jessica Oyelowo] was told her IQ is off the charts during an assessment for ADHD. Now, she’s a member of Mensa. Our four children are neurodiverse, too. They have incredibly special attributes that they wear as superpowers. I’m in awe that I get to be their father.Any lasting relationshipneeds non-negotiables.We made the decisionearly on never to be apart for longer than two weeks: 26 years married and we’ve only broken that rule once, by 11 hours, when my wife was inSleepy Hollow. If I ever meet [director] Tim Burton, I’ll be having words.Never let the sungo down on your wrath. We won’t go to bed if a disagreement isn’t resolved – sleep makes it grow like cancer. Before you know it, you don’t remember why you were fighting, ego and pride becomes a factor, and then it starts to fall apart.God has neverlet me down. He’s a key factor in guiding my decisions and feeling safe within them. My wife and I suffered three miscarriages, one of them quite late in the pregnancy. Without faith, we would have retreated into our own corners to lick our wounds, but our love increased.Sidney Poitier, a hero of mine, was full of compliments and respect when we met. I mustered up the courage to say hello and to tell him what he means to me, but instead he started talking about my work. I still doubt myself that it happened, but I have the photograph.Oprah Winfreyplayed my mother inThe Butler.In one scene, she slaps me across the face, which was nerve-racking, because with each take she was gaining in confidence. Oprah taught me that the intention with which you do something manifests in the thing itself. If your intentions are pure, the chances are that it will be edifying both for you and the people you’re doing it for.Success is subjective.It can sometimes mean coming away from something that failed, knowing you gave your best.

She discusses sex, feminism and her struggles to be an ‘ordinary earthling’Sat 19 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTShare“Ihave had relationships with humans, but I’ve also loved a lot of people in stories,” Sayaka Murata, the Japanese author of the bestsellerConvenience Store Woman, confides a few minutes into our interview. “I’ve been told by my doctor not to talk about this too much, but ever since I was a child, I’ve had 30 or 40 imaginary friends who live on a different star or planet with whom I have shared love and sexual experiences.”It is 7pm in Tokyo, mid-morning in London. Sitting upright at a desk in an empty publisher’s office, the 45-year-old author – wearing a cream silk blouse and with a neatly curled bob – might be reading the news rather than discussing imaginary friends. For context, her latest novel to be translated into English, Vanishing World, depicts a future in which people no longer have sex and the main character carries 40 “lovers” – plastic anime key rings – in her black Prada pouch. Our conversation is made possible thanks to the skilful translation of Bethan Jones, who relates Murata’s long, thoughtful and utterly unpredictable answers. As video calls go, the experience is so otherworldly the three of us might be beaming in from different planets.Murata is the author of 12 novels, although most readers outside Japan will know her for Convenience Store Woman, her 10th, and the first to be translated into English, in 2018. A convenience store orkonbiniseems an unlikely setting for a global cult hit, yet this eerily unsettling novel about 36-year-old Keiko Furukura, who has worked in the Smile Mart since she graduated and has never had a romantic relationship, has sold more than 2m copies and been translated into more than 30 languages. It won Japan’s prestigious Akutagawa prize in 2016, when Vogue Japan named Murata a woman of the year. The book’s success helped spark therecent boomin Japanese fiction in translation, paving the way for predominantly female writers including Mieko Kawakami (Breasts and Eggs),Asako Yuzuki(author of last year’s bestseller, Butter) and Hiromi Kawakami (Under the Eye of the Big Bird, shortlisted for this year’s International Booker prize). “I never imagined that so many people would read it in Japan, let alone in other countries,” Murata says now. “It explores some quite unique aspects of Japanese culture.”Reading Murata’s novels is not unlike finding yourself in a 24-hour store in an unknown city: everything is both familiar and exotic, orderly yet disquietingly unnatural and out of time. All the absurdities and cruelties of a sexist, consumerist society are revealed to be as artificial as candy under fluorescent lighting. Then there is the disorienting queasiness of her moral lens, like a security camera in the corner, recording everything without judgment. “What a lot of hassle,” Keiko reflects, watching her sister try to soothe her baby, before glancing at a cake knife. “If it was just a matter of keeping him quiet, it would be easy enough.”Yet readers all over the world have identified with her endearingly offbeat heroine, who has been interpreted as being neurodivergent or autistic, although that wasn’t the author’s intention. “It feels like a lot of people see her as a friend,” Murata says. “She manages to express a part of themselves.”She describes Convenience Store Woman as her “least triggering” novel. “There are no scenes of cruelty, there’s no sex, Keiko doesn’t kill anyone.” The rest of Murata’s work is darker and weirder, continually questioning social norms. Why is it more barbaric to eat a dead body than to burn it? Is the family the only way to bring up children? Wouldn’t marriage be simpler without love? “What about the real world? Where the hell is that anyway?” a character asks in the title story of her most recent collection, Life Ceremony.Some say the worlds I write about are dystopian, but a lot of people think reality is worseVanishing World was published in Japanese in 2015, before Convenience Store Woman, and is her third novel to be translated into English (all by Ginny Tapley Takemori), afterEarthlingsin 2020, about a girl who believes she is an alien. It poses another darkly comic thought experiment – what’s the point of sex when you could just have IVF? In Murata’s pristine speculative future, love is disappearing and “primitive copulation” is considered dirty. “The very idea of a married couple having sex, it’s horrifying!” one character exclaims. “The human race has advanced,” we are told. Men can give birth from synthetic wombs and children are raised collectively. Everyone is a “mother”.Murata herself considers marriage to be “a kind of hostage situation” and motherhood “a curse” that would put an end to her life as a writer. Much of her writing involves imaginative attempts to resolve the biological fatalism of being female with humanity’s need to procreate. Her outlandish near-future fictional worlds are all rooted in the reality of Japan’s declining birth and marriage rates, an increase in young people choosing celibacy, not to mention deeply entrenchedmisogyny.For many, Murata has become a left-field feminist icon. “Feminism is desperately needed in Japanese society today,” she says, describing “a hell soup” in which fathers have beengiven lenient sentencesfor raping their daughters and feminists receive death threats. “Some say that the worlds I write about are dystopian, but a lot of people think that actually reality is worse.”Vanishing World grew out of a short story, A Clean Marriage, published in English inGranta magazine in 2014, about a couple who choose a “Clean Breeder” contraption in order to conceive because they prefer not to have sex – although they do with other people. Many readers responded saying it portrayed their ideal relationship.InJapan, thanks largely to the popularity of manga and anime, what Murata calls “ficto-sexual” attachments or relationships are not so unusual, she says. For a long time she couldn’t imagine having sex with another human being. “I’ve often felt love, obsession, desire, friendship, a kind of faith, or almost a prayer-like relationship with these men – and they’ve always been men, so it’s a heterosexual relationship – who live inside stories,” she explains. A lot of her friends have experienced similar feelings, she says. “With Vanishing World I was trying to create a place where it might be easier for people who find it difficult to live in this world.”View image in fullscreenMurata has always found it difficult to live in this world. As a child, all she wanted was to be normal. “I wanted to blend in. I wanted not to be a foreign object,” she says. “Now, I think that is frightening.” Since she started writing 20 years ago, all her work has been an attempt to answer the question: “what is normal and what is abnormal?” she says. “But the more I’ve experimented with it, the more unstable the boundary has become. I started to think that normality itself is a kind of insanity.”Murata grew up in a small city in Chiba, a prefecture east of Tokyo, in the 1980s. Her parents had an arranged marriage and very traditional values. Her father was a judge, her mother, now 79, a housewife. It was not a happy childhood. “It looked good from the outside,” she says, “but now I think that I was starved of love, and that my brain was numbed and anaesthetised. But I was able to play the role of a normal girl. To this day, I think that my ability to get angry broke as a way of protecting myself.” Unsurprisingly, mothers don’t come out well in her fiction. In Vanishing World, Amane feels “the sticky fingerprints” of her mother’s soul all over the house and “an intense urge” to throw up after eating her cooking.From a very young age, Murata never thought of her body as her own. “The grownups would always talk about whether Sayaka had childbearing hips,” she recalls. “It was almost like they were keeping an eye on my uterus, which was something that existed not for me, but for them, for the relatives.” No matter how much she tried to resolve the conflict of motherhood in her fiction, she has never escaped “this idea of being expected to reproduce for the good of the village”.She found erotic magazines hidden in her older brother’s bedroom. “It was all over the place,” she says of the culture at that time; even the manga comics aimed at young girls involved the characters being forced to take their clothes off. “So I didn’t think of sexual love as something that I could choose for myself,” she says. “I always thought of my body as a tool for men to relieve their sexual desires.” Looking back, she endured “a lot of unpleasant sexual experiences”, including rape, some of which she was unable to recognise for what they were. “I hadn’t realised that I was abused, that I was a victim, or that I was crushed by the way that my mum spoke to me,” she says. “I’ve survived, I think, by forgetting.” She also survived by writing stories. From the age of 10, writing became the one place where she could express all these feelings.As a student at Tokyo’s Tamagawa University, studying for a degree in art curation (combining art, music, literature and theatre), she started work at a convenience store. She then worked in a succession of similarkonbinis, like Keiko, for another 18 years. There she was able to forget her gender for the first time. Unlike her only other job as a waitress, where she was told to wear makeup and behave in a certain way, in the convenience store men and women wore the same uniform and did the same job. “No one said anything if you showed up one day with no makeup,” she says. “It was almost like I wasn’t a woman, I was just a convenience store worker. I was just a kindly vending machine.”She would wake at 2am and write until 6am before starting her shift, then she would go to a cafe when it finished at lunchtime and write all afternoon. To begin with, it never occurred to her to write about the store itself. But then she realised that this too was a vanishing world, with self-service tills replacing workers. “Suddenly I thought: I need to write about this now, the role that it plays in society, the functions it fulfils. I need to capture this moment.”Murata only gave up working in the store in 2017, but her routine hasn’t changed much since. She still lives in the Shinjuku district of Tokyo, where she moved as a student. To escape the storytelling in her head and her “incredibly messy” apartment, she prefers to work in cafes. She needs to hear the sound of people around her, and often moves from one cafe to another. Sometimes, she goes for a walk in the nearby Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, before taking the tube home. “It’s a very boring routine.”Murata still occasionally finds it a struggle to be what she calls an “ordinary earthling”. She suffers from bouts of dysautonomia and vertigo. After becoming fixated on killing an established male editor she calls Z-san, who she felt was a bully who abused his power, she ended up in hospital. She wrote about the ordeal, in an untranslated essay published in Shinchō magazine in 2022, titled The Commonplace Urge to Kill.She certainly doesn’t think of herself as an internationally famous novelist. She was once taught to think of writing as sheet music, with readers playing the notes. “But the music isn’t mine,” she says. “I’m happy if there are a lot of people performing this music and that gives me the motivation to keep writing.”Is she happy more generally? “Hai!” she replies so emphatically it doesn’t need translating. “Yes, I am very happy. I am surrounded by things I love and I am now able to talk about things that I had kept hidden. I can say I am blessed.” Then she says thank you and goodbye in English, and that it would be lovely to meet in the real world one day.

A series is planned (rumoured working title:Ladies of the Cotswolds) and it sounds posher than most. It’s made by the company behindGrand Designsand set in the “chocolate box” town of Charlbury, in the Evenlode valley.Names are being proposed for the series, such as Gabriela Peacock (nutritionist entrepreneur married to hedge fund banker David Peacock, and pals with Joan Collins and Princess Beatrice). Plum Sykes (author of last year’s Cotswolds-set novelWives Like Us) is thought to be scripting the voiceover. Then there’s “Suzie Jet” (Suzannah Harvey), CEO of the local airport. How marvellously down to earth and relatable they all sound. Though of course they don’t, and that’s the point.There’s a semi-antecedent toLadies of the Cotswolds–Ladies of London, which aired from 2014 to 2017 on Bravo. There’s also the reality juggernautMade in Chelsea, though that’s pitched younger. ­The rural element of this latest toff-reality cultural fusion seems to link the success of the 2024 Disney+ adaptation ofJilly Cooper’sRivalswith the ongoing Brit obsession with the generationally wealthy.Thus, the Cotswolds is ideal: running through counties including Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire and Wiltshire, it’s Posh Central, anddubbed the “Hamptons of the UK”. It is chocka with salubrious hangouts: Soho Farmhouse; Estelle Manor; The Bull, in Charlbury; The Pig in the Cotswolds. Celebrity locals include Kate Moss; the Beckhams; andClaudia Winkleman. The Chipping Norton set: Jeremy Clarkson, the Camerons, Blur’s Alex James; Rebekah Brooks. Taylor Swift is thought to have stayed near Great Tew when she was performing on the UK leg of her Eras tour. Now, Beyoncé and Jay-Z are said to be contemplating buying a property in the Cotswolds area.View image in fullscreenThe success of Rivals was further proof of the Brit obsession with the generationally wealthy.Photograph: Robert ViglaskyIn this way, the series ties in less with old money, rolling hills and stately piles and more with toff influencers pushing lifestyle aspiration on social media. Which makes the Cotswolds less a region, rather an uber-gentrified brand redolent of honey-hued cottages, ice baths and welly-boot scrapers. In what may be a deal breaker for many, it’s apparently difficult to secure housekeepers and grooms.In more prosaic terms, there are problems with overtourism and locals being priced out of the area. Still, one can only read, enviously rapt, about the freshwater swimming pools, organic farm shops, multiple kitchens and stables with Range Rovers. The very best that rural England (stealth wealth division) has to offer.All of which makes it strange to hear thatLadiesis inspired byTheReal HousewivesofBeverly Hillsand the extended Real Housewives global franchise. In the UK, there’sTheReal Housewives of Cheshire, whileTheReal Housewives of Londonis mooted. Real Housewives content tends to have three main components: grooming, gossip and drama. Cast members are required to, shall we say, speak their truth. Add hair extensions, shellac nails and almost daily gown-fittings and it’s part glittering social whirl, part bloodbath.How would this brand of “reality” land in the Cotswolds, where the properly wealthy don’t require the cash, and the famously private don’t need the exposure? An area where high-flying financiers don’t want their lives turned into reputational rubble, and landowners wouldn’t know a Molly-Mae Hague from an irrigation trench in the fallow field. Even now, there are reports of Cotswold establishments being disinclined to giveLadiespermission to film on their premises. In terms of Cotswolds sensibilities and etiquette, would appearing on reality TV be considered a faux pas?Rupert Wesson is director of Debrett’s, the authority on traditions, society and culture. “People who are very wealthy don’t feel the need to expose themselves,” he says, but “nowadays the barriers for what is filmed for media channels and what is filmed for TV are blurring”. Wesson lives in the Cotswolds and points out it already has a prominent reality TV show, Prime Video’sClarkson’s Farm. Also, that aristocrats have sometimes allowed cameras to film their estates and themselves, often to help finance the astronomical upkeep.View image in fullscreenIt is thought that Beyoncé and Jay-Z are looking for a property in the Cotswolds.Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/ReutersWouldn’t wealthy Cotswolds types consider appearing on reality TV naff? “They’d just see it as unnecessary,” Wesson says, adding that Debrett’s wouldn’t take a view. “We tend not to opine on this sort of thing.” Would such an area produce reality-style material? “There are plenty of people who want to be on TV and are prepared to sign up to what I think the professionals call heightened reality. Most people will know it isn’t real life – it’s just a curated version. Still they buy into it. I’m sure it will look beautiful. I’m sure the people on it will look beautiful. That in itself is enough to draw people in.”Playing into all this is the ever-shifting nature of reality TV itself, and the ongoing censure of it. Its content (augmented; premeditated; soft-scripted) has long been disparaged as the enemy of creativity. In 2014, Gary Oldman called it “the museum of social decay”, adding of the Kardashians: “My dog has more dignity than those fuckers.”It perhaps says something that, barMade in Chelseaand the odd aristo-participant (Lady Colin Campbell; Lord Brocket) inI’m a Celebrity… , drama rather than reality is where our longstanding fascination (and scorn, and sometimes affection) for the rich and privileged has played out: historically (Brideshead Revisited) and more recently inSuccession;The White Lotus;andRivals. Are wealthy people less likely to play the reality TV game because, frankly, they don’t need to? Is this going to be a problem forLadies of the Cotswolds?As Netflix’sWith Love, Meghanlifestyle-love-in demonstrated, there can be only so much enthralment watching wealthy sorts collecting honey from photogenic hives, or sprinkling flowers on food. In cynical Britain, there’s only so much aspirational swanking audiences can take, before they cry: “Where’s thedirt?” And they don’t mean scraping good honest Cotswold mud off Le Chameau wellies. At the same time, an era where lifestyle is king, does it matter so long as we all get to peek inside their Aga Rangemasters?Explore more on these topicsReality TVThe ObserverGentrificationGloucestershireOxfordshireWarwickshireWorcestershireWiltshirefeaturesShareReuse this content"

His 2015Rockyspin-offCreedrepresents the gold standard when it comes to franchise-wrangling, honouring the original series yet standing up and fighting its own corner as a distinct movie. If anyone has earned the chance to make a passion project, it’s Coogler. But who knew that this would result in something as wild, untrammelled and thrillingly unpredictable asSinners? Starring Michael B Jordan in the dual role of 1930s gangster twins Smoke (surly, threatening) and Stack (charming, reckless), it’s a sweltering, sexy southern gothic horror, a blues-infused vampire flick in which the music flows as freely as the blood.The brothers leave Chicago with the kind of cash that usually comes with a body count. Back in their Mississippi homeland, they team up with a young cousin, aspiring bluesman Sammie (Miles Caton, an impressive newcomer with deep, rich bourbon-soaked voice). The plan: to open a Black-owned juke joint under the noses of the Ku Klux Klan. But it turns out that an even greater evil awaits them.If you pick apart the story threads,Sinnersis a little messy, but Coogler’s assurance and vision holds everything together. It looks phenomenal: shot on 70mm film, the frame throbs with sultry, come-hither reds and golds. The soundtrack is hot-headed and dangerous – and not just the blues. There’s a feverish, feral version of the Irish folk song Rocky Road to Dublin that still gives me goose bumps a full week later.In UK, Irish and Australian cinemasWatch a trailer for Sinners.Explore more on these topicsFilmThe ObserverHorror filmsRyan CooglerMichael B JordanBlack PantherMarvelCreedreviewsShareReuse this content"

Never sailed the Aegean. A cross-channel ferry was enough for Joseph Mallord William Turner to understand the might and majesty of the sea. His 1803 painting Calais Pier records his feelings on his first arrival in France as foaming green mountains of waves look as if they’re about to sweep away the frail wooden jetty where passengers from England are expected to disembark. He is fascinated and appalled by the water, so solid in its power but always shifting, dissolving, sheering away.If JMW Turner, born250 years agothis spring, is Britain’s greatest artist – and he is – it is partly because he is so intensely aware of a defining fact about his country: it’s an island. For Turner, Britain is bordered by death, terror and adventure. Just one step from shore takes you into a world of peril. In the Iveagh Seapiece, fishers are hauling up their boats on a soaking beach while a wave like a wall surges towards them. One fishing boat is still out on the wild waters, so near to shore yet so far from safety.Island artist though he is, Turner’s imagination is the opposite of insular. It takes in lost civilisations and ancient myths, mountains he crossed and seas he never did. The wars that started with the French Revolution in 1789 had imprisoned Britain behind the Royal Navy’s “wooden walls”. When a short-lived peace broke out, the young landscape artist took his chance to travel, seeing a wine festival in Mâcon, gazing in awe at Mont Blanc – to judge from paintings he showed the next year. Before he ever saw the continent, he painted legendary Italy. All his life, he would keep up Europhile painterly pilgrimages to Venice and Rome, Heidelberg and the Saint Gotthard Pass.Turner was born near Covent Garden, London, on 23 April 1775, in a Britain that seemed a much bigger place than it does now. Every distance was vaster, every road felt longer. It took several days to get from London to Chester, Newcastle or Exeter. There was terra incognita at the end of your lane. When the young Turner set out on sketching tours – to Wales in 1792, the north of England in 1797 – these were journeys in a mysterious land.View image in fullscreenJMW Turner’s Calais Pier, 1803.Photograph: The National Gallery, LondonTouring Britain and Europe, returning with full sketchbooks, painting in his London studio – this was Turner’s life. He showed such talent for art he was accepted into the Royal Academy Schools at 14. He never knew failure and once his career got going in the 1790s, never needed to fear poverty. He was an artistic mountain, a formidable mass of productivity, who left reams of drawings and watercolours and prints as well as oil paintings, much of it bequeathed to the nation when he died in 1851. But, outside his work, you can’t really make much of Turner as a character. He slept with women but never married, built a house near the Thames, kept working, made a last home in Chelsea with his lover Sophia Booth, died there in view of the Thames. His soul is in his art.It is also our soul. Turner shows us our land as a place of wonder and possibility. And he’s not entirely making it up. In the golden yellow watercolour of Durham, painted around 1835, he has turned the cathedral with its twin Norman towers through 45 degrees to fit the view better and bestowed upon it the same honeyed sunlit radiance he might to a scene in Italy. But he also records the truth. On the bridge in the foreground are small figures that might be tired travellers looking for food, work, shelter who see the dazzling cathedral above them. That’s his message. We may think we live in a crushed, unjust place and time but look up and see the light and you can be uplifted by sudden beauty, irradiated by hope.His vision of a world torn between tragedy and possibility stretches from everyday observation to bloody myth. In his 1811 painting Apollo and Python, the Greek god of light and reason has just killed a scaly monster embodying the irrational. But it’s an empty victory, for we glimpse other serpentine horrors still lurking in the tangled woody landscape. In his greatest single image of myth, Ulysses Deriding Polyphemus: Homer’s Odyssey, an incandescent, smoky seascape off the coast of Sicily is the setting as the one-eyed giant cyclops rages atop Etna and the Greek hero and his crew laughingly escape the blinded monster. But the flaming sky is a false promise of freedom. Polyphemus calls on his father, Neptune, for vengeance: the sea god will wipe out Ulysses’ men and delay his homecoming.How did Turner become so familiar with the classics? It’s tempting to see him as a working-class hero but he did not stand outside elite culture. He grew up at a time when the commercial competition and artistic daring of Hogarth, Gainsborough, Stubbs and Wright had made British art come alive. As a pupil at the Royal Academy schools, he was expected to draw from plaster casts of classical art as well as absorb the erudite references of contemporary artists such as Richard Wilson and Joshua Reynolds.Artwas Turner’s education in an age of educated art.View image in fullscreenJMW Turner’s The Fighting Temeraire, 1839.Photograph: The National Gallery, LondonHis age was also the Romantic age, when nature was embraced like a religion. Turner started showing at the Royal Academy’s annual shows in the 1790s, when poets were experimenting with folk forms and hymning nature’s joys. Wordsworth and Coleridge published Lyrical Ballads in 1798 which included The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Lines Written a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey. Turner’s early art consciously aligns itself with the Romantic generation. In the same year that the Lakeside Poets broke through, he cunningly showed his view Morning Amongst the Coniston Fells.As a conscious Romantic he subscribed to theories of the picturesque and sublime and reckoned what he was doing was a kind of poetry. Landscape art had developed in the 17th century but was given new meaning in the Romantic age as nature became the bearer of intense ideals, when there was an equation of inner and outer states. Even music depicted landscape in Beethoven’s Pastoral Symphony.View image in fullscreenJMW Turner.Photograph: Print Collector/Getty ImagesTurner didn’t identify with the humble voice of a Wordsworth. His hero was Lord Byron, the most aristocratic, “immoral”, cynically observant, internationalist and political of Romantics. He even wrote his own Byronic poem, The Fallacies of Hope. He would travel to Venice and other Italian cities in emulation of Byron’s Childe Harold, aiming for the same blend of travel reportage and polemic. His painting of the gory aftermath of the Battle of Waterloo, a morass of slaughtered bodies under the light of a nocturnal flare, has an inscription quoting Byron’s account of the scene: “The earth is covered thick with other clay / Which her own clay shall cover, heaped and pent, / Rider and horse – friend, foe – in one red burial blent!” His identification with the poet shows the kind of artist he wanted to be: political and dangerous, an adventurer with a heart.Turner is as much a painter of time as light. He can make you marvel at the antiquity of rocks and buildings, how they have endured. History as survival fills his paintings of Caernarfon Castle or the Roman Forum. Yet he can show you sudden destruction that in an instant wipes away unchanging centuries.When the Houses of Parliament caught fire in 1834 he was on hand to paint the mass of red flame reflected in the Thames and the watching crowds, the centuries going up in smoke as the medieval heart of English government was destroyed. But do his paintings of this event mourn a disaster or rejoice in a new beginning? Two years previously the Great Reform Act had swept away much old rotten constitutional detritus. Turner may love the past but he thrills to change – even to the flames consuming the old order.This ambivalent eye for history is why Turner’s 250th birthday means so much. His dates have unusual significance. Born into a preindustrial world, he would live until 1851, the year of the Great Exhibition that celebrated Britain’s Victorian industrial might. The French Revolution and the wars it unleashed overshadow his early art. But he also witnessed the Industrial Revolution and revelled in its new energies. Industry is never just a blight for Turner, more a release of natural forces (which, scientifically, is what it was). Steam rules the waves in Staffa, Fingal’s Cave, which delights in the paradox that sightseers are taken to see an ancient natural wonder by a modern technological marvel, puffing its way through the waves.The passing away of the old and the careless brightness of the future collide in his 1839 canvas The Fighting Temeraire. The world of Turner’s youth is gone: one of its last relics, a ship of the line that fought at Trafalgar, is being towed to its last resting place on a Thames with shimmering bronzed waters to rival any of his mythic seas.View image in fullscreenJMW Turner’s Slavers Throwing Overboard the Dead and Dying (Typhoon Coming On), 1840.Photograph: AlamyThe Thames was the first stretch of water Turner saw. Its tidal reaches were surely where he first intuited the mystery of water, its instability. On it nothing is solid and there is no protector. Turner is supposed to have said in his dying hours, “The Sun is God!” If so, the sea is the devil. Ever since it was unveiled in 1840, Slavers Throwing Overboard the Dead and Dying (Typhoon Coming On) has been recognised as his supreme masterpiece. The wealthy father of Turner’s critical champion, John Ruskin, bought it for his son. Ruskin revered the painting but could not live with it, and not just because of the human content. This is Turner’s most harrowing sky, stained with bloody crimsons and purples, a vomitous natural wonder, its lurid light infecting the gas-green waves where monster fish swarm. Then there is that human content: legs and arms in the water, weighted by iron manacles and chains. It is not the sky and sea that are sick after all but the type of human society represented by the ship. Nature is not divine or cursed. But what of us?Turner: In Light and Shade review – bathe in the redemptive power of landscape artRead moreBritain had abolished the slave trade in 1807 and most Victorians were content to congratulate themselves on this. Why rake up the past? It took the imagination of Turner to return to the true story of the Zong, a slave ship out of Liverpool whose crew murdered more than 130 enslaved Africans in 1781, and make this horror as immediate, undying – and British – as the Fighting Temeraire.What is Turner’s legacy? You could call him the Rembrandt of the sea, or the Leonardo of landscape – he has the universality and complexity of these artists. He loved to compete with the old masters, painting versions of Dutch sea-pieces and Claude’s Italian scenes.The occasional sniffy critic claims Constable is more honest and real, or sees Turner’s prodigious output as bombastic and eccentric. But Turner knows what he is doing. He wants painting to simultaneously touch the soul, arouse the senses and challenge the mind with the most serious meditations on history, politics, even time and space. When the Hubble space telescope and now the James Webb telescope started sending back data, this was translated by Nasa into smoky, sublime images of deep space by which we now navigate our cosmos. What do these Romantic nebulae most resemble? Turner’s paintings, of course.Turner 250, a year-long festival of events, is running now at theTate Britain, London;Turner Contemporary, Margate, and galleries around the UK.Explore more on these topicsJMW TurnerArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

O’Reilly, who was born in Dublin, but grew up in Adelaide then moved to Sydney to study acting, was one among many.“The little roles were populated by those of us who were around,” she says, from her current home in London.Growing up, O’Reilly had seen 1983’s Return of the Jedi but paid more attention to Princess Leia and the Ewoks than the brief appearance of Rebel Alliance leader Mon Mothma, then played by English actor Caroline Blakiston. But when George Lucas was making his final Star Wars prequel, 2005’s Revenge of the Sith, he needed someone who could pass for a younger version of Blakiston. A certain fresh-out-of-drama-school Irish-Australian looked the part.“I remember working with Natalie Portman, with Jimmy Smits, really extraordinary actors at the top of their craft,” O’Reilly says of her time in the “well-oiled” Lucasfilm machine. “I got to be with them and just drink all that in.”“And then the role was cut!” she laughs.View image in fullscreenGenevieve O’Reilly as Mon Mothma in Andor season 2, with Alastair Mackenzie as Mothma’s husband Perrin Fertha and Stellan Skarsgård as Luthen Rael.Photograph: Lucasfilm Ltd™Andor: how a Star Wars deep cut became one of the best TV shows of the yearRead moreLikeClaudia Karvan’s turn as Luke Skywalker’s long-lost auntin Attack of the Clones, it seemed O’Reilly’s blink-and-miss turn as Mon Mothma would exist only as a DVD extra seen by mega fans – until a decade later, when she received a phone call.O’Reilly was now living in London, not far from where a new slate of Star Wars films were being filmed under the franchise’s new owners, Disney. She was invited to reprise the role of Mon Mothma in Rogue One, a 2016 prequel set immediately before Lucas’ original trilogy; in it, she sported the bob haircut and white robe Blakiston had donned back in 1983. (“We used to lovingly call it ‘the sack’,” O’Reilly says.)She was happy to return, but the limitations of the role soon became apparent: “Mon Mothma had always been an expositional character – she was there to inform us what was going on, and where the protagonists would move next.”View image in fullscreenO’Reilly as Mon Mothma (left), looking over a hologram of the Death Star with Diego Luna as Cassian Andor (centre) in Rogue One.Photograph: Lucasfilm LtdThis meant that when Disney commissioned a spin-off TV series tracing the arc of Cassian Andor, a rebel pilot played by Diego Luna inRogue One,O’Reilly wasn’t sold on returning. It was showrunner Tony Gilroy – the Bourne Identity and Michael Clayton screenwriter who had stepped in for reshoots on Rogue One – who convinced her.“I remember saying to him, ‘Listen to me, I think you’re the best, but I’m not really that keen to step into another expositional version of this woman’. And he said, ‘I promise you, I’m interested inher. Let’s find out who this woman is.”Blakiston’s only memorable line in Return of the Jedi – “Many Bothans died to bring us this information” – hinted at unseen sacrifice and struggle hidden beneath Lucas’ swashbuckling space opera.When Andor’s first season aired in 2022, that tragic subtext became its raison d’être. The show also offered viewers something rare: a Star Wars spin-off that actually reckoned with the realities of life in a fascist empire and one that could stand on its own. Andor was a compelling character-driven drama and political thriller that stretched the edges of its genre trappings.The trailer for Andor season 2.In Andor, Mon Mothma walks a high-wire: the image of a respectable senator while secretly funding the underground resistance. “I show you the stone in my hand, you miss the knife at your throat,” she confides in an old friend. “The Mon Mothma people think they know, it’s a lie.”From her very first scenes, O’Reilly says, Gilroy fleshed out her double life: “[He] set up the complexity of character – you understand what she has to lose, that there are eyes on her, that people’s lives are at stake. It’s deeply specific and clever writing.”At the end of season one of Andor, Mothma was on the cusp of marrying off her only daughter for the sake of the Rebellion. Season two picks up on her home planet Chandrila, a world that drips with privilege and high culture. The lavish costumes and sets represent not only the stark wealth disparities across the galaxy, but also how far Mothma has to fall.“I remember saying, ‘Gosh, I feel like I’m in Downton Abbey in Star Wars’,” she says. “It was really about family and nuance and threat. And it feels deeply human.”Gilroy granted O’Reilly a rare amount of agency over how her character meets those threats; for several key scenes, O’Reilly says Gilroy went back to his keyboard after picking her brain. “He’s instinctively collaborative,” she says. “He’s interested in nuance. He’s interested in the cells in between things, rather than the skeleton.”View image in fullscreenGenevieve O’Reilly (third from left) with Andor co-stars Denise Gough, Stellan Skarsgård, Diego Luna, Adria Arjona, Ben Mendelsohn and Faye Marsay.Photograph: Anthony Harvey/REX/ShutterstockLike the first season, Andor’s depiction of colonial crackdowns and post-truth, authoritarian regimes evoke historical narratives closer to home. At times, it can even seem to mirror today’s news cycle – despite Gilroy’s scripts being completed two years ago, before the 2023 writers’ strike briefly froze the production.“I think ‘empire’ is a huge part of our human history, across continents, across ages,” O’Reilly reflects. “Empire has been part of us – it’s kind of the ugly side of human ambition, I think.“We have all been affected by historical empires, in Australia, Ireland, America, Africa, Portugal, France … the tentacles of empire run deep across our humanity.”Daisy Ridley’s Rey is now Star Wars’ best big-screen bet – is this a saga without a plan?Read moreAndor’s slow-burning pace and keenly observed tension ensures that when Mon Mothma does finally become the Rebel figurehead that we barely saw in Return of the Jedi, the gravitas of her leadership feels earned – a rallying call rather than a plot dump.O’Reilly has had other big roles over the years, starring opposite Eric Bana in the outback noir hit The Dry, and Tim Roth in three seasons of Tin Star. But two decades after that first meeting in Sydney, what began as a skin-deep casting choice has become a rare kind of experience – the “opportunity to really be a part of discovering, and putting flesh on the bones of this woman”.“I believe her,” she adds. “Which is something that you don’t always feel.”Andor season two starts on Disney+ on Tuesday.This article was amended on 19 April 2025 to correct the second picture caption, in which we misspelled the first name of Alastair Mackenzie.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionStar WarsRogue One: A Star Wars StoryScience fiction and fantasy filmsScience fiction TVinterviewsShareReuse this content"

She has starred in films includingAtonementandSuffragette, and TV seriesThe HourandThe Miniaturist. Her directorial debut, the horror filmAmulet, was released in 2020. Last year Garai portrayedAnnie ErnauxinEline Arbo’s adaptation ofThe Yearsat the Almeida theatre, later transferring to the Harold Pinter theatre, for which she won best actress in a supporting role at the 2025 Olivier awards. Now she stars alongside Ivanno Jeremiah and Jamelia in new BBC Three comedy drama,Just Act Normal, available on iPlayer.1.Short storiesShe’s Always Hungry by Eliza ClarkView image in fullscreenEliza Clark.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The ObserverI’m not usually a fan of the short story – I often find them not very fulfilling. But I really like Eliza Clark as a writer, so I was excited to read these. The stories are great and very funny: there’s such weird and dark humour in them. There’s one story particularly, called The King, which is about an alien living in the body of an ad executive. And at the end of the world they form a new civilisation. It’s a really witty pastiche on gender relations, and quite horrific, but extremely enjoyable.2.DanceVollmond, Sadler’s WellsView image in fullscreenMaria Giovanna Delle Donne in Vollmond by Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch and Terrain Boris Charmatz at Sadler’s Wells.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianI saw this about a month ago. I’m a huge fan of Pina Bausch and I always try to go when her company, Tanztheater Wuppertal, is performing. I’d not seen this piece before, and the dancing in it was unbelievably daring. There’s a whole section at the end where the stage is full of water and the dancers have to run backwards and forwards through it. Quite a few of the dancers fell over – it’s amazing to see people who are so committed to what they’re doing that they’re putting themselves in physical danger to achieve it.3.SongSay It Like You Mean It by Sleater-KinneyView image in fullscreenCarrie Brownstein, left, and Corin Tucker of Sleater-Kinney.Photograph: Chris HornbeckerThis song does something weird to me. I quite often play it when I’m running, and then I start running really fast, like I’m chasing a mugger. It makes me feel intensely euphoric. It’s a really sad song – Carrie Brownstein lost her mum in a car accident in 2022, so it’s about grief and saying goodbye – but very beautiful. I’ve loved Sleater-Kinney for many years. All the music I like is sad – I don’t like any upbeat music. But this song is incredibly purifying in its expression of grief.4.TVYellowjacketsWatch a trailer for Yellowjackets.The glut of television makes it hard to find things I really want to watch, but this show has struck me profoundly. It’s about a group of women who go through an unbelievably extreme experience early on together, and it looks at the way they recover from trauma. They try to rationalise it, react against it, commodify the experience. It’s truthful and brilliant. There’s a scene in which one of the younger actresses, Sophie Nélisse, gives birth in the wilderness – it’s a feat of acting. I don’t understand why they haven’t all won the top acting awards.5.PodcastThe Rest Is History – The French RevolutionI’m a big history geek so I love this podcast. It’s like you’re sitting around a campfire. They’re very good at bringing history to life in a vivid way. The one they recently did about the French Revolution was just incredible, particularly the ones on Marie Antoinette and what happened to her. They talk about revolution, and what happens to ideas when they’re co-opted by the worst kinds of people, and excesses of ideology. When an ideology takes over, it’s never really about the idea – the idea is to end up in charge.6.PlaceAbney Park Cemetery, Stoke Newington, LondonView image in fullscreenAbney Park Cemetery in London.Photograph: James Osmond/AlamyAbney Park Cemetery is a mysterious and beautiful place that’s been allowed to go somewhat wild. We have lots of lovely parks in London, but not that many wild places. You can walk around and hear woodpeckers and it feels very much like it’s part of nature. Because it’s full of trees, you see the passing of the seasons amazingly. And you can read the headstones – your brain is constantly whirring, thinking about all the titbits you get. There’s one that I love where it says: “Died in an accident.” And always, I’m like: “What accident?”7. HotelLe Cottage Bise, FranceView image in fullscreenLe Cottage Bise on Lake Annecy.Photograph: LabonWe stayed in this hotel on the shores of Lake Annecy in a town called Talloires. It’s been there since the turn of the last century. In the morning, when you have breakfast, you sit on a terrace which looks up at the Alps. Then you can walk 50 feet and just get into the lake and swim. The lake is like Evian water – it’s the most unbelievably beautiful water to swim in. They have kayaks and pedalos. It’s one of the nicest places I’ve ever been.Explore more on these topicsRomola GaraiOn my radarDanceTelevisionPodcastsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

(Sun Rais an obvious fellow traveller.) Since his re-emergence a decade back, Ackamoor has deliveredfour impressive albums for the Strut label, which is marking National Record Store Day with this recording of a 2024 San Francisco concert. It’s a powerful, uncompromising work, combining an expanded big band, the Ankhestra, with spoken-word outings by Hollywood actor Danny Glover alongside fellow activist Rhodessa Jones.Opener Afro Futuristic Dreams is a call to arms, its massed chants shapeshifting into driving soul and a rich instrumental mix led by violin and flute. The group draw on hard bop and serpentine melodies on Tembeka and the jauntier Thank You God. The centrepiece is Glover’s Grandma Cole Story, which turns the harrowing ordeals of a 10-year-old African girl aboard a slave ship into a a triumph of spirit via a blaze of Blakean imagery. China Lane Suite charts a cross-racial love affair, while In God’s Country is Glover’s tribute to his mother. Ackamoor’s Prayer for Changing Times is self-explanatory, both demanding and joyous.Listen to Thank You God by Idris Ackamoor and the Pyramids.Explore more on these topicsJazzThe ObserverSoulreviewsShareReuse this content"

Standing in a row, glaring at the theatre audience, areSelf Esteemand 10 dancers. They are not dancing. It’s a tense, delicious contradiction. The company stand stock-still for what feels like ages, clad in bonnets, collars and black gowns – half convent, half Gilead.When they do move, it’s just their heads at first, glaring accusatively at one spotlit audience member. Gradually, these halting and jerky gestures become spasms, which become seizures, until finally the tension is released into something akin to dancing.The propulsive music, meanwhile, comes from one of the best tracks from Self Esteem’s brand new album,A Complicated Woman, released next week. Mother finds Rebecca Lucy Taylor telling a lover how she is not there to parent them. “Work on your own shit,” she sneers. Taylor’s forthrightness is made up of equal parts fed-up, straight-talking northerner and arts-leaning OnlyFans dominatrix. “Are you interested in growing?” she demands witheringly. “There is other literature outside ofThe Catcher in the Rye.” While it’s very much a banger from the present, there are hints here ofUnderworldand ofPeaches– the grand dame of 00s underground sex-positive club music, whose work was full of hard emotional reckonings.This five-night theatrical presentation of Self Esteem’s new album is very much an ensemble piece in which group singing and moving as a mass are as important as the singular pop star at the front. Taylor citesDavid Byrne’sAmerican Utopiatouras a source, but there’s a lot ofMitskiin here too. The performers move like a murmuration of starlings around Taylor.View image in fullscreen‘A compulsion to puncture pomposity with a wink’: Self Esteem at the Duke of York’s.Photograph: Aaron ParsonsLies – a new song about the falsehoods we tell others to make them comfortable and how we believe them ourselves because it’s easier – plays out as a seated circle, with the lights revealing the foreboding Club Gilead space around the performers to be a well-used community hall; piled-up benches, visible backstage clutter. The climax of the first act, however, finds the performers cavorting in a tableau of simulated carnality; Hieronymus Bosch viaHigh School Musical. Later, everyone will be in football kits, doing lunges to 69, a song about sexual positions.And we’re back! Taylor’s last album, 2021’s unmissablePrioritise Pleasure, perfectly bottled a set of feelings about her life and times that pointed up the ferocious contradictions of contemporary womanhood, queer and straight. It resonated hard, catapulting Self Esteem from cult act to flavour of the moment as the post-pandemic era prompted many into similar recalibrations. Stop people-pleasing, FFS, was the album’s overarching message to all comers; please yourself.When the album’s cycle reached its end, Taylor took on other work, most notably a role inCabaret. She credits that experience with teaching her a degree of self-care; another way of making art that could be less gruelling than the indie rock method. Taylor spent many years in a band,Slow Club, before being reborn as DIY pop maximalist; she ran herself into the groundtouringPrioritise Pleasure,anyway.Watch the video for 69 by Self Esteem.Hence this show, which will –Self Esteem has hinted elsewhere– be followed by a more conventional tour. It starts off sublime; an unexpected highlight (if that’s the right word) is a projected image of the South African polymathMoonchild Sanelly, a guest on the album, weeping silently circa In Plain Sight. “What the fuck you want from me?” Sanelly cries, in playback, and the choir swell to join her.Gradually, the show becomes less like an artistic statement about the threat to women’s autonomy and the complexities of getting what you want andstillhaving to work on your own shit regardless, and more like a gig. Last album hits such asWizardryandI Do This All the Timepunctuate the run of new songs: a reasonable tactic that gets people up and out of their seats. It really is great to hear them again, in the company of others, but it still feels like a slight dilution of Taylor’s stark vision tonight.‘Everything I wanted was offered to me. But I felt nothing’: singer Self Esteem on stardom, self-doubt, and making it in a man’s worldRead moreSelf Esteem’s fans love her for many reasons. One is Taylor’s sense of humour – or more specifically, her compulsion to puncture pomposity with a wink. Many will feel that this evening’s triumphant return hits a crescendo around the perky dance pop of Cheers to Me, with a message in hot pink projected on a screen: “Please do the dance on TikTok I want to buy Janet and Andy a caravan,” it reads.“Let’s toast each and every fucker that made me this way,” the song invites. Soon there’s a simulated dating app projected on the screen starring inflatable tube men and real ones on stage; Taylor and her performers bend them over to make a wind machine for her hair. It’s a laugh – clever and apt. But far more affecting is Taylor’s heartfelt speech afterwards about keeping going, keeping trying and not struggling alone. “We have to do it together, I think,” she says.Explore more on these topicsSelf EsteemKitty Empire's artist of the weekPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

But the folk games at the heart of this year’s edition have now filtered into the mainstream, from Taskmaster to The TraitorsSimon ParkinSat 19 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTShareWhen she was a child growing up in Adelaide, Australia,Holly Gramaziomade up a game with her friend Summer. The two girls would lie back on swings with their eyes closed. When someone made too much noise nearby, they’d sit to attention and yell as loudly as they could: “Don’t wake me up!” The game captured a child’s view of grownups and their irksome inconsistencies – the self-defeating idea, or perhaps threat, that an adult could scream themselves awake amid their stated efforts to remain asleep. It was a co-operative game: the two girls “won” if they shouted in unison. If only one yelled, they lost. “This is the first game I remember playing,” records Gramazio in the printed guide (which also doubles as a delicious compendium of folk games) for the finalNow Play Thisfestival of experimental game design.It’s wrapping up “for the same reasons a lot of festivals wrap up”,she writesin a blog post marking its closure. “Sooner or later you need to find a way to make it more sustainable… Or if you can’t do that, you have to go: well, we had a fun time but that’s enough.”Gramazio is a game designer and novelist. Her bestselling 2024 bookThe Husbandsis a playful satire on contemporary dating, in which the protagonist magically receives a new potential husband whenever her current partner climbs the ladder into her attic. (It’s currently being adapted for Apple TV+, with Juno Temple in the lead role.) Gramazio co-founded Now Play This in 2015 with the designer V Buckenham. The festival has taken place at Somerset House, London, every spring since, except for a couple of remote editions during the pandemic. It has been something of an antidote to the usual boisterous video game events, where trailers for the latest titles vie for attention from dangling screens, and queues of backpack-wearing teens wait patiently for a quick go on a forthcoming blockbuster.When Gramazio and Buckenham started Now Play This, indie games were in the ascendancy. Development tools such as Unity had democratised game-making, and ubiquitous digital stores such as Apple’s App Store and Steam enabled small teams to make their work available to a global audience at the touch of a “submit” button. Stars emerged: Derek Yu, creator ofSpelunky, in which you guide a fragile cave explorer through a deadly, forever-shifting underground cave system; Bennett Foddy, designer ofQWOP, a hilariously frustrating physics-based game where you control an Olympic runner’s thighs and calves one key at a time (and which even had a cameo in the US version ofThe Office);and Lucas Pope, whose gamePapers, Pleaseshowed mainstream audiences that video games could be more than digital shooting galleries, even addressing weightier themes such as immigration and bureaucracy. A scene emerged, and kooky, playful live events such as Babycastles in New York, or the Wild Rumpus in London, where attendees could play unfinished hits of tomorrow, became popular.The unifying factor in Now Play This was an interest in game design as cultural practice, not merely for profitEven at that time, Now Play This was on the more experimental end of the spectrum, celebrating games that blurred the lines between screen-based play and physical controllers involving, say, ropes or skateboards. The unifying factor was an interest in game design as cultural practice, not merely for profit. And Gramazio’s love of folk games – typically amusements that can be played in a group, require no special equipment and are passed between communities in an oral tradition – ran through everything.Since the debut of Now Play This, traditional games have become firmly mainstream. Hit Channel 4 showTaskmaster, now entering its 19th season, is an endlessly delightful compendium of folk games (“Count the beans in this baked bean tin. Your time starts now”; “Get this camel through the smallest gap. You have 10 minutes”).The Traitors, soon to debut on the BBC in a celebrity version, refines the popular parlour game Mafia, also known as Werewolf. Now Play This would often present similar everyday games, but with their original charged motifs in place. For example, Bolshevik Circus is a deceptive game of tag in which participants have hidden roles: president, guard, assassin or communist. Like Gramazio’s childhood game about not waking her parents, this is a low-stakes reproduction of a more frightening, capricious vision of the adult world.This year’s event presented a different format, closer to a symposium than a weird arcade, with fewer games on offer and a greater representation of student projects. Attendees heard talks on, for example, the responsibility that designers of role-playing games have to the emotional wellbeing of their players, who might play through a provocative scenario about grief or abuse (a tool increasingly used by psychotherapists, according to the speaker), then must shake themselves out of the experience as they reinhabit their own reality. But there were plenty of playable, experimental games too, such as Rave Confusion, in which you play as a character lost at a rave, searching for someone as things become increasingly distorted and confusing.The value of these kinds of lively conversations and experiments is clear. Often work created and debuted at the margins of the field of game design has filtered through to influence the mainstream hits. Minecraft and Fortnite (as well asThe Traitors) have their roots in experimental design that was never intended to turn a profit. And yet the fierce commercialisation of the industry, and post-pandemic struggles of live events, mean there are fewer spaces for this kind of experimental play for play’s sake. So, as we celebrate a decade of playfulness in the heart of the capital, we also mourn its passing, and the loss of what might have emerged because of its continued existence.Explore more on these topicsGamesThe ObserverEventsTaskmasterThe TraitorsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The bells of the Kremlin, deep and massive, toll. Red Square, deserted in the early morning, is pocked with the violence of a mob uprising the night before. Russia is in turmoil. So beginsKhovanshchinaby Modest Mussorgsky (1839-81), unfinished at his death from alcoholic delirium at the age of 42, and one of the unsolved riddles of the operatic repertoire. This grand, sprawling work opened the 2025Salzburg Easter festival, well suited to this year’s theme of “wounds and wonders”, in a compelling new production conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen and performed by an international cast and musicians from Salonen’s homeland, the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra.With sleuth-like determination over eight years and counting, he and a creative team led by the British fraternal partnership ofdirector Simon McBurney and composer Gerard McBurney– fondly referred to in Salzburg as the McBrothers – presented a world-premiere staging of a new version of the opera. Originally intended for the Bolshoi theatre, Moscow in 2020, first Covid and then the invasion of Ukraine put paid to any such plan.Khovanshchinais steeped in the Russian psyche. Mussorgsky, grappling with his country’s schismatic social and religious history, saw the past in the present. Using factual sources, he wrote his own idiosyncratic libretto, taking the so-called Khovansky Affair of the late 17th century as his starting point: Old Believers rise up against the westernising reforms of a regime that would lead to the rule of Peter the Great.All the physical theatre strengths of Simon McBurney are brought into playThe parallels with modern Russia are unmissable but not exact. This opera has no heroes. The sight, on the Salzburg stage, of a clean-shaven politician in grey suit, standing at a lectern in front of a replica of the Bolshoi curtain issuing diktats, needs no comment. The feudal lord Khovansky (Vitalij Kowaljow), facing death and festering in a self-indulgence of lust and drugs, has conspicuous oligarchic tendencies. Make your own connections. Every character is an embodiment of a ruthless faction seeking dominion, expressed through the raw melodies that are Mussorgsky’s hallmarks, the drama always driven by the music, liturgical chant dipping in and out of folk song and sung-speech patterns. Epic and populous choruses (superbly sung by the Slovak Philharmonic Choir and others), also a key component of the composer’s better-known masterpiece,Boris Godunov, hold up a mirror to the suffering of a nation.View image in fullscreenVitalij Kowaljow as Khovansky: ‘conspicuous oligarch tendencies’:Photograph: Inés BacherAgainst this historical tapestry, one fictional role offers a change of pace: that of Marfa, Old Believer and clairvoyant, Mother Russia figure, lover of seemingly every man on the stage, now violent, now devout. She is played with exceptional vocal and dramatic brilliance by the young mezzo-sopranoNadezhda Karyazina, born in Moscow, living in Switzerland, in what is surely a career-making performance. Resonant and strong at the top of her range, rich and potent in the contralto low notes, she is pivotal, offering humanity and empathy. At the moment of apocalypse, when the Old Believers determine on mass suicide, she raises her arms as a shower of earth falls on her, one of many moments of beauty in a production unafraid of harsh, modern realities.All the physical theatre strengths of Simon McBurney, best known for work with his company Complicité and a rare but probing visitor to opera (his stagings ofWozzeckfor Aix-en-Provence andThe Magic Flutefor English National Opera, currently on atNew York’s Metropolitan Opera, have been triumphs), are brought into play, to bracing effect. In Rebecca Ringst’s striking designs, which also use live video, the stage shifts from open space to steep rake to triangular compression, performers and chorus moving with fearless energy. In a large cast, Thomas Atkins, Ain Anger, Daniel Okulitch, Natalia Tanasii and Matthew White stood out.The reconstruction by Gerard McBurney, as fiercely imaginative as it is resolutely faithful – every note written, in some form or other, by Mussorgsky – uses material discovered in a Russian museum in the 1960s, woven convincingly together with the rest. The ending by Stravinsky (made, when he was in the midst ofThe Rite of Spring, at the request of the impresario Diaghilev) and the 1959 orchestration by Shostakovich for a film, the basis of most modern performances, are used here. McBurney’s new musical bridge provides a missing link to the opera’s skein of broken threads. A reflection of the importance of this staging ofKhovanshchinawas the presence in Salzburg of every opera intendant of note, among them those from Munich, Aix, the RoyalOperaand the New York Met, where the production will travel, probably in 2030. By then its relevance may be even more acute.View image in fullscreenAigul Akhmetshina as Carmen and Freddie De Tommaso as Don José.Photograph: Marc BrennerBizet’sCarmen,though minimally problematic in comparison, also exists in different versions. Damiano Michieletto’s staging for the Royal Opera, revived by Dan Dooner, lacks focus and often looks chaotic, especially in crowd scenes. With Bizet’s fertile score and the alluring 28-year-old Russian mezzo-sopranoAigul Akhmetshinareprising her Carmen (apparently she will have sung it 100 times by the end of this season), there is much to enjoy. Despite an apology for illness, she still sang stunningly, even while lying on her back, and shimmied perfectly around her drooling menfolk. As Don José, the British tenorFreddie De Tommasogradually relaxed to display his famed shining top notes and, as the role demands, an awkward, stiff pathos. This is not a vintageCarmenon stage, but the conducting of Mark Elder, pliant, springy and detailed, and the dazzling playing by the orchestra, reminded us anew of Bizet’s short-lived but enduring genius.Star ratings (out of five)Khovanshchina★★★★★Carmen★★★Khovanshchinais at the Salzburg Easter festival, Austria, until 21 AprilCarmenis at the Royal Opera, London, until 3 JulyExplore more on these topicsClassical musicThe ObserverOperaRoyal Opera HouseSimon McBurneylive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not just that he encourages thought and creativity, enabling people such asCrystal Pite, Emily Molnar and Jill Johnson to emerge as significant forces in their own right. It’s also that he makes dancers look so powerful, majestic, in control of time and space and their own destinies.English National Ballet’sThe Forsythe Programme,which has been filling Sadler’s Wells with adoring audiences this past week, is a case in point. In three contrasting works, the sense of dance prowess realised springs from the questing character of Forsythe himself. Never a man to rest on his laurels, in his mid-70s he’s still refining and rethinking dance. He seems constantly to ask himself what something is, turning it like a diamond to see how the facets will refract the light.Rearray(London Edition 2025), originally made as a duet in2011 for Sylvie Guillem and Nicolas Le Riche, has been refashioned as a trio, with one central ballerina (now on pointe) and two male consorts. In a series of short scenes separated by sudden blackouts, sometimes to David Morrow’s dark-hued score, sometimes in silence, the dancers shape the air in fiercely defined symmetries.In her central role, Sangeun Lee’s long legs flick into casual attitudes, her arms outstretched into impossible geometry. Halfway through a movement, she seems to hesitate, question where to go next. In the dark, positions shift, often surprisingly. The men (Henry Dowden, Rentaro Nakaaki) are watchful, in her thrall. They fling off sprightly jumps, super-fast turns; sit on stage, arms interlinked like medieval jesters.The piece is full of quotations from works of the past, struck almost casually before the dancers move on. In the next cast, Emily Suzuki brings a gentler flow to the dynamics of the movement, less haughty than Lee but still very much a queen to the attendant men (Jose María Lorca Menchón and Miguel Angel Maidana).View image in fullscreen‘Eye-popping entrechats’: Herman Schmerman (Quintet).Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianThe pensive mood is in marked contrast to the muscular vitality ofHerman Schmerman(Quintet), for two men and three women to music by Thom Willems, reconceived with a bright blue background (lighting design Tanja Rühl) and orange plush velvet leotards. Created for New York CityBalletin 1992, its title taken from Steve Martin’s noir parodyDead Men Don’t Wear Plaid, it’s an abstract piece of circus vitality that sets its participants off in cheekily insouciant showoff turns.The energy is electric as, on opening night, Aitor Arrieta, Alice Bellini, Ivana Bueno, Francesco Gabriele Frola and Swanice Luong stroll on to fling themselves into off-kilter pirouettes and eye-popping entrechats, feet and limbs moving at pace. At the end, they all fall down – a tribute to the final moment ofBalanchine’sSerenade, perhaps, but also a reflection of just how exhausting the combinations they throw off are.View image in fullscreen‘Full of feeling’: Junor Souza and Precious Adams in Playlist (EP).Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianThe delicious contrast between the formality of the patterns created and the relaxed bravura of the dancers is amped to the max in the final work,Playlist (EP)from 2022, in which dazzling feats of balletic virtuosity are set to a score by artists including Peven Everett, Lion Babe and Barry White.It begins with ENB’s impressive cohort of men performing athletic (and often rarely used) ballet combinations like battling club dancers, raising the roof with the sheer elevation of their jumps and the sharpness of their turns. Then the women enter like a brilliant chorus line. The intricate shifts of their movements, alone and in constantly changing configurations, release a sense of infectious pleasure. Yet amid the delirium there’s subtlety too: a duet for Junor Souza and Precious Adams to Natalie Cole’s This Will Be (An Everlasting Love) is full of feeling as well as panache.The entire evening feels like an assertion of ballet’s ability to wrap its past and future into one joyful package. Forsythe’s works are a jewel in ENB’s crown, and the company makes them gleam.The Forsythe Programme is at Sadler’s Wells, London, until 19 AprilWatch a trailer for The Forsythe Programme.Explore more on these topicsBalletThe ObserverDanceEnglish National BalletWilliam ForsytheSadler's WellsreviewsShareReuse this content"

From King Lear toLogan Roy, they are the linchpins of countless family dramas: adored fathers who dominate and damage their children in equal measure.The new novel from Rachel Joyce, bestselling author ofThe Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry,Miss Benson’s Beetleand others, revolves around one such man: Vic Kemp, a successful artist with four grown-up children. Vic is a widower who raised his offspring alone, and the story begins with him summoning them to a noodle bar to announce that he’s in love with a twentysomething called Bella-Mae he met online. He’s also the proud owner of a goatee, a surefire sign of an identity crisis. The offspring are aghast. “If he’s so lonely, he could get a cat,” says one.Worse is to come. Before his children can meet her, septuagenarian Vic and “soulmate” Bella-Mae have left for Italy, where they have a quickie wedding and set up home in Vic’s secluded lakeside villa. The siblings are still reeling from this bombshell when they hear that their newlywed father has died suddenly in strange circumstances. Distraught and disbelieving, they descend on the villa hoping for answers and, amid the ensuing confrontations and revelations, the family begins to fall apart.The Homemade God moves between being a page-turning mystery and an astute study of family dynamics, and readers who like a book to pick a lane and stay in it may find this frustrating. But Joyce is a thoughtful writer, and the narrative gear-changes echo the novel’s concerns: the gap between image and reality, the difference between who we are believed to be – by ourselves and others – and who we really are. (The enigmatic Bella-Mae is rumoured to be an “influencer”, that most illusory of occupations.)Joyce shows how losing a parent is a surreal mix of horror and banal admin, interspersed with hysteria and binge-drinkingThese themes are made manifest in Vic: a self-made man wealthy enough to buy a dreamy Italian villa that is “the kind of house where a famous artist might live”, but insecure about his success, because “everything he knew about art he learned through copying”. Vic paints from photographs, creating Jack Vettriano-ish images that are popular as posters and greetings cards, but dismissed by critics. One of the mysteries his children hope to solve is the whereabouts of a missing painting Vic was working on before he died – a late masterpiece that might yet prove the sniffy critics wrong.Joyce gradually reveals how Vic’s children have been shaped by their father’s frustrated ambitions, how the hole at the centre of his life has become the hole at the centre of theirs. The eldest, Netta, has served as pseudo-parent to her siblings while her father was busy with his art (and his boozing and his womanising), while second-born Susan was a pseudo-trad wife, cooking and cleaning for him. Gustav or “Goose”, the only son and a sensitive soul, prefers to hide in the shadows of Vic’s studio, preparing his canvases, while Iris, the youngest, has the dubious privilege of being asked to model for a father who paints “semi-erotic” images. Like many children of neglectful parents, the quartet have formed an uneasy gang, united against the world, but somehow frozen in the roles they adopted as young children, until the shock waves from Vic’s death blow them apart.This is what Joyce does best: untangle family ties. She reveals how a family is built on a fragile collective agreement about what that family is: an ongoing collusion. The Kemp children have agreed that Daddy is a great artist, and have distorted themselves to accommodate this idea. Iris, when hugged by Vic, folds her body into his “to make the smallest possible gift of herself”.Joyce is also exceptionally good at blending the big stuff of life with the small, showing how losing a parent is a surreal mix of gut-wrenching horror and banal admin, interspersed with hysteria and binge-drinking. Susan, being fussed over after Vic’s death, observes that “grief makes an invalid of you and at the same time a kind of celebrity”. The close focus on the siblings can sometimes mean their respective partners and other secondary characters are less clearly seen, but this is a minor quibble in an otherwise sharp, absorbing and emotionally intelligent novel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Like some, she had a family codeword designed to show that an adult picking them up from school when her mother was busy could be trusted. But, in her American home town in the 1980s, no other kid’s word was a bygone British sweet. And so “Dolly Mixture” joins the growing list of things learned from her English mother that Christle, looking back, finds out of place. Things such as dining etiquette, cardigans, M&S outfits, margarine. But also bigger stuff: beliefs and behaviours. Assumptions. Silence. Shame.With her mother in her 70s and their relationship strained, Christle, a poet and academic, embarks on a quest for new understanding – of her mother, of “Englishness”, and of herself. In a memoir that pulses with feeling and intelligence, she excavates the past to expose difficult truths. As she proved with her acclaimed 2019 cultural history of tears,The Crying Book, she excels at facing the unfaceable, weaving her personal experience into the wider tapestry of science, history, politics and other people’s lives.In the Rhododendrons features four trips to England – one with her mother and sister, the others alone. The first was a pilgrimage to places from her mother’s childhood in leafy Richmond and Kew. Her mother points to an alleyway and says casually: “And that is where a man molested me when I was eight.” She says she never told anyone. She bore the trauma alone.This would be a shock to any daughter. But for Christle, it was both shattering and consoling news. Finally, there might be a reason for their unspoken conflict, which began after Christle’s own sexual assault. In 1995, the family came to England for a funeral. Christle stayed with an older cousin, went clubbing with his friends. Drunk, she was led down an alley, and raped by a stranger. She was only 14.In the tumultuous aftermath, she craved closeness to her mother. But instead she felt rejection, abandonment, blame. Like an exhibit at one of the many museums she visits, their relationship is fixed behind glass; a diorama of a mother and daughter in irreparable pain. An emotional journey, therefore, underpins these physical journeys – a journey back to the origins of rupture, and forward towards mutual understanding, compassion and growth.Woolf is a bridge between past and present, mother and daughter, imagination and factThis proves to be far from easy. Numerous paths to reconciliation are dead ends. “What do you want me to do?” her mother snaps. “I can’t go back and change the past.” Christle’s unspoken rebuttal: “Youcanchange the past … you just have to look. Looking changes what you see.” This is the springboard for her later visits, alone, to England: “I would look until I changed the past and the past, in turn, changed me.”Virginia Woolfis Christle’s guide on these journeys. She anchors her thinking, providing an intellectual framework on which to examine her mother through a safer lens (one of the many “subjects through which I can perceive my mother indirectly”). Woolf lived in the same area, allowing Christle to build “chains of touch” as she overlays maps of their worlds.Christle’s companionship with Woolf is both playful (she imagines buying Woolf an ice-cream from a van near her statue in Richmond) and respectful. She explicitly avoids pathologising the much-tragedised author; she also doesn’t “force and flatten her into a happy shape for my pleasure or use”. Rather, Woolf is a bridge between past and present, mother and daughter, imagination and fact. “It was easier … to trust Woolf’s perception than my mother’s,” she writes, adding: “Woolf can’t hurt me (haha).”More accurately, facts can’t hurt her. Whenever we veer too close to her personal narrative, Christle smothers the wound in bandages of fact. Foucault, Walter Benjamin, Jamaica Kincaid; stereoscopes, architecture, sunspots, birds. While these strands add colour to the overall tapestry, they also delay, divert, distract. “I find it hard to remain as close to myself as these memories might demand,” she admits. “It’s easier to distance my thoughts with … theory, to gaze at events through glass.”Her research confronts, among other things, England’s ugly legacy of imperial dehumanisation, erasure, violence and abuse. There’s a sense she has to deconstruct everything before building something honest, real and new. The same applies to the bond with her mother. “I did not know how to love my mother without also loving her country,” Christle writes. “Neither took kindly to being questioned. Conflict was impolite.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionChristle embraces that questioning and conflict. More comfortable in the “role of journalist … than daughter”, she treats her mother as a research resource. She asks to read the diaries that unflinchingly record their difficulties. Her mother hands them over with a warning (“Sometimes I didn’t like you”) and a defence (“Would you have liked you back then?”). The entries confirm what Christle sensed since the attack: “She found me upsetting … I looked for, but couldn’t find, a sense she was frightenedforme. Onlyof.”So the narrative swings, with nuance and sensitivity, between connection and compassion, wrath and withdrawal. When Christle tries to leave her mother out, she fails. It becomes clear she is writing this book for them both.Throughout, Christle wills the stories of Woolf and other doomed women “to turn otherwise”. Ultimately, she knows, they cannot. But for her and her mother, there is a gradual turning. No climactic showdown or Hollywood hug. Just a simple, powerful realisation: “We do want to understand one another. We do want to be understood.” The journey carries on. “She is sensitive; she is also brave,” Christle writes of her mother – a description that applies to them both, and to this book.Holly Dawson is reader in residence at Charleston Trust and author of All of Us Atoms (Canongate).

A baby washes up in a boat after a storm, and is adopted by Grace (Lara Jean Chorostecki) and Bobby (Clayne Crawford), the mayor of an isolated isle dependent on fishing. Ten years later, the girl, Isla (Alix West Lefler), turns out to have healing powers, as well as the ability to attract large shoals of fish. But when she loses her magic, the community starts to panic about the end of their traditional way of life and demand Isla saves them.

We meet space ranger Buzz (voiced by Chris Evans) as his mistake leads his spaceship to crash on a dangerous planet. Test-flights of a new hyperdrive lead to time dilation, so his ground crew age more quickly than him. Then Emperor Zurg appears … Buzz here is smarter than his plastic avatar, and the action is in the stars not the suburbs, but it retains that Pixar focus on the strength of family.Saturday 19 April, 5.40pm, BBC OneThe GameView image in fullscreenFrantic … Michael Douglas is a banker whose life turns into an absurd alternative reality in The Game.Photograph: AllstarWhat do you get the man who has everything for his birthday? How about an existential crisis?David Fincher’s tightly wound 1997 thriller about banker Nicholas Van Orton delivers peak Michael Douglas – a smug man brought low but learning valuable lessons. The gift of a mysterious game by his brother Conrad (Sean Penn) is the start of a dark few days of the soul for Nicholas, as a series of increasingly fraught role-playing scenarios (or are they actually real?) – bring up memories of their father’s suicide and focus his mind on his own empty life.Saturday 19 April, 9pm, Legend XtraOliver!View image in fullscreenMore? … Mark Lester and Jack Wild star in Oliver!Photograph: SNAP/RexWho will buy this wonderful movie? Lionel Bart’s musical version of the Charles Dickens novel sidelines a lot of the novel’s darkness and social edge, but when you’ve got fantastic, earwormy tunes such as Food, Glorious Food, Consider Yourself and You’ve Got to Pick a Pocket or Two it’s hard not to prioritise pleasure. Carol Reed’s colourful adaptation is well served by Ron Moody’s sneaky Fagin and a menacing Oliver Reed as Sikes, while Jack Wild’s spirited Dodger makes up for a relatively insipid Oliver – a fault of Dickens, not angelic youngster Mark Lester.Easter Sunday, 3.40pm, Channel 4skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dirk Bogarde is superb as self-absorbed married Oxford don Stephen. After a car crash kills his favoured student William (Michael York), flashbacks about their relationship and William’s girlfriend Anna (Jacqueline Sassard) unfurl a story of entitlement, temptation and near-sociopathy in his insular academic world.Monday 21 April, 9.05pm, Talking Pictures TVThey LiveView image in fullscreenSeeing things … Nada (Roddy Piper, right) uncovers a hidden world in They Live.Photograph: MCA/Universal/AllstarJohn Carpenter’s pulpy 1988 sci-fi action flick is also a hotbed of anticapitalist sentiment.

I have a stage 4 brain tumour, and I don’t know how long I have left.” When fellow walker Peter utters these words to me at the Minack theatre in Porthcurno on Cornwall’s south coast, I half think he might be reading lines for a new play. Behind him, the waves are dancing, while mist swirls on the wind as though spooling from a smoke machine.It had only been an hour since I first met him and his wife, Michelle, as we all took shelter from the freezing wind in a hut at nearby Gwennap Head. I had asked why they were walking the South West Coast Path – the 630-mile (1,014km) trail that weaves its way from the seaside town of Minehead in Somerset around to Poole harbour in Dorset, via the windswept headlands, secluded coves and beaches of Devon and Cornwall.View image in fullscreenThey’d said it seemed like a good idea and that they’d like to finish it one day. “If we have the time,” Peter had added. Without knowing the full import of his words at the time, I’d said farewell and wandered on.This coastal path is many things to many people. Thought to have existed in some form since the late 17th century, it was first forged by smugglers, then paced by coastguards determined to catch them. Since it was opened as a National Trail in 1978, it has been trodden by countless hikers looking for a challenge.We stood at Land’s End in an incredible storm and could have given up, but we realised how much life the path was giving us backRaynor WinnBack in 2012, I visited it for the first time as part of my “extreme sleeping challenge”, camping high above the waves in a bivvy bag on the southernmost point of mainland Britain, Lizard Point, something I wrote about in my bookExtreme Sleeps.In a strange twist of fate, Raynor Winn had read my book just before she and her husband, Moth, lost their family farm in 2013. A business deal with a friend had gone awry, leaving them temporarily homeless. In a story strikingly similar to that of the walker I’d just met, in the same week Moth had been diagnosed with a terminal neurodegenerative condition.With nowhere to go and nothing to do, they decided tosimply walk the coastal pathand make the trail their home. Their story is told inRaynor’s memoir The Salt Path, which has gone on to sell more than two million copies worldwide and has been adapted into a film starring Gillian Anderson and Jason Isaacs, due to be released in May.View image in fullscreenThe South West Coast Path as it nears the Lizard Point in Cornwall.Photograph: Deejpilot/Getty Images/iStockphoto“It feels bizarre,” says Raynor – or Ray, as she likes to be called – when I call to congratulate her on the film. “We visited the set at the Valley of Rocks [a dramatic stretch of coast on the northern edge of Exmoor] and I hadn’t been back there since we walked through it with our rucksacks. So to go there and to see ourselves being portrayed in what had been a really difficult, vulnerable, early point in our journey really brought back emotions I hadn’t been quite so connected to in recent times.”I ask Ray which part of the path she loved the most and she told me it was the stretch from Zennor to the Minack theatre in Cornwall. “It was a turning point for us because we stood at Land’s End in an incredible storm and there was nobody there, just us and the Atlantic, and waves were breaking over that headland.“And we really could have given up, but at that point we just realised how much that path was giving us, how much life it was giving us back. And I visit it often because I always seem to find some way of making sense of things there.”I know exactly what she means. The path is where I once wandered to come to terms with losing my mum, and again when I lost a dear friend. And now, in the middle of a relationship breakdown, Ray’s words have inspired me to take the Night Riviera sleeper train to Penzance, hail a cab, and hit the trail at the Tinners Arms in Zennor – the spot where, in the book, Ray and Moth arrive bedraggled after being caught in a storm.View image in fullscreenThe Minack theatre in Porthcurno.Photograph: Mathew Roberts Photography/Getty ImagesI wander out on to the rough path to see the sun struggling to break through the clouds. The wind whistles wildly through my hair while the waves crash below the cliffs, the landscape embodying my inner emotional squall. It’s March, so the early spring palette of russet and earthy khaki is only occasionally broken up with a splash of colour from the bright yellow gorse flowers or clusters of purple dog violets.At the spur of Gurnard’s Head, I meet my first fellow walker – Reid from Lancaster. He is on day two of a three-month journey from Land’s End to John o’Groats, raising money for the British Heart Foundation in memory of his grandma and father, both of whom died within the past two years. “To be honest, I don’t know what to do with my life, so following a trail seems like a good idea,” he says, before walking on.In The Salt Path, a woman tells Raynor and Moth that they have become ‘salted’ – meaning they are for ever connected to this pathNot everyone I meet has emotive reasons for walking. Fiona and Derek from Brighton – who I happen upon before reaching the first of many remnants of the mining industry on a stretch known as the Tin Coast – are retired. They decided after Covid to try to complete the trail, undertaking sections when they could, staying in people’s homes as pet-sitters to save on the cost of B&Bs.Near Porthmeor Cove, I meet John and Jane, from Holsworthy in Devon. It took them 10 years to complete the path over weekends, and they still walk it regularly. While navigating my way through a herd of wild ponies at Treen, I chat to Myriam, from Germany, who has two months free between jobs so decided to walk the Cornish section. At Portheras Cove, I leave the trail to sit on the white sand beach, watching the impossibly blue sea.View image in fullscreenRaynor Winn and her husband, Moth, at home in Polruan. They lost their family farm in 2013.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianIn The Salt Path, it is here that a woman tells Ray and Moth they have become “salted” – meaning they are for ever connected to this path due to their time spent treading it.Crumbling engine houses with distinctive Cornish chimney stacks line the route at Geevor and Botallack, and I temporarily share the trail with local schoolchildren being guided by teachers. I will my tired legs up to the ruins of iron age Kenidjack Castle and finally spot Cape Cornwall – the promontory that, until 200 years ago, was believed to be farther south-west than Land’s End.The wind begins to change and I head to rest at the only place close to the trail –Cape Cornwall Club– where the luxury of a hot tub awaits, followed by a cold beer with a view of a blistering sunset over the point where the Irish Sea meets the Atlantic Ocean.By the time the sun emerges, I have surrendered to the power of the trail, where everything is as simple as putting one foot in front of the otherMy second day sees me walk alone with my thoughts for the first couple of hours, and with each step the clouds begin to clear. By the time the sun emerges, I have surrendered to the power of the trail, where everything is as simple as putting one foot in front of the other. Sally and Hugh, a retired couple from Kent, bring me back into the here and now when they tell me they have been ticking off sections of the path since they spent their honeymoon here in 1986. I smile as they unknowingly flaunt their love while I have lost mine. I focus on the surfers that bob like croutons on a blue soup.At Land’s End, I watch the tourists pay to take their photos with the souvenir sign, and turn to face the full force of a bitter, easterly wind head-on, as I continue on my own path forwards. Finally, I reach Gwennap, where I meet Peter and Michelle, who are walking, like Moth, with the shadow of uncertainty lingering ahead. My whole situation is unexpectedly pushed into perspective, and I know that whatever happens next, I can keep going.When I ask Ray how Moth is now, 12 years after their epic walk, she says: “It’s been hard and difficult, but he’s still here and he’s still fighting through every day. He’s actually out walking at the moment. And that’s all you can hope for, isn’t it? That you can get up in the morning and go for a walk.”For further information, visitsouthwestcoastpath.org.uk.Phoebe Smith’s latest book, Wayfarer: Love, Loss and Life on Britain’sPilgrimPaths, is published by HarperNorth at £10.99.

They’re not actually pickled, but cooked in a similar way to the Indianacharstyle of cooking that uses particular spices alongside an acidic ingredient, such as lemon juice. They go really well with a typical south Indian curd (yoghurt) rice and a fiery little shop-bought pickle.Pickled new potatoes with curd riceMy favourite pickle to eat with this isIndian gooseberry pickle, oramla, which is hot, salty and oily. I’m not sure if there’s a suitable substitute in British supermarkets, but it will also be fine without.Prep10 minCook55 minServes4300g basmati rice750g new potatoes, washedFine sea saltRapeseed oil350g plain coconut yoghurt(ie, with no added sugar) – I likeCoconut Collab2½ tbsp lemon juice2 tbsp mung dal, or chana dal1½ black mustard seeds1½ tsp cumin seeds2 tbsp sesame seeds3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced½ tsp ground turmeric1 green finger chilli, finely sliced20 fresh curry leavesPut the rice in a bowl, add cold water to cover, then swirl with your hands until the water turns cloudy.

Cover with 500ml freshly boiled water, add a teaspoon of salt and a tablespoon of oil, then stir and pop on the lid. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to a simmer and cook for 12 minutes. Scrape the rice into a bowl and add the yoghurt, 200ml warm water, a tablespoon of lemon juice and a half-teaspoon of salt. Beat with a fork until smooth and the consistency of dense rice pudding – when you shake the bowl, the rice should settle into a creamy layer.Cut the cooled potatoes into 2cm cubes. Put six tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan on a medium-high heat and, when hot, add the dal and stir-fry for about three minutes, until a rich, nutty brown. Add the mustard, cumin and sesame seeds, garlic, turmeric, chilli and curry leaves all at once – careful, because they might splutter – then stir for a minute. Add the potatoes, fry for about three minutes, moving them around occasionally, then add a teaspoon and a half of salt and a tablespoon and a half of lemon juice. Mix well, fry for another three minutes, then take off the heat.Check the rice: if it has drunk up all the water, mix in up to another 100ml, if need be, to maintain that rice pudding consistency. Decant the rice on to a platter, spoon the potatoes evenly over the top and serve straight away with some pickle on the side.Explore more on these topicsIndian food and drinkThe new veganRiceVegetablesFoodPotatoesMain courseVegetarian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

Somewhere between a cake and a mousse, it’s the perfect end to an Easter celebration (serve with creme fraiche and chilled sliced blood oranges) and a great make-ahead dessert at any time of year.Prep35 minCook40 minServes8-10260g dark chocolateNeutral oil, baking spray or butter, for greasing260g butter1 tbsp strong brewed coffee8 eggs100g soft light brown sugar160g caster sugar85g cocoa powder½ tsp fine salt2 tbsp cocoa nibs(optional)1 Break up the chocolateView image in fullscreenBreak or chop the chocolate into chunks (I favour one with about 70% cocoa content for this, but your taste may differ). I find that whacking it still in its packaging on a hard surface is the most satisfying way to do this, but otherwise a serrated knife such as a bread knife is the most effective tool, followed by a heavy cleaver.2 Grease and line the cake tinView image in fullscreenUsing neutral oil, baking spray or extra butter, lightly grease a loose-bottomed 23cm cake tin (if you don’t have one exactly that size, it’s always better to go with something smaller and be prepared to bake the cake for slightly longer, to account for the increased depth of batter), then line with greaseproof paper.3 Melt the chocolate and butterView image in fullscreenDice the butter, then put it in a heatproof bowl with the chopped chocolate, and set this over a saucepan of simmering water – make sure the base of the bowl is not touching the water, or you risk burning the chocolate. Give the mix an occasional stir until they’ve melted together. (Alternatively, microwave on low or medium power in 30-second bursts, stirring between each, until melted.)4 Flavour the chocolateMake the coffee (instant is fine), if necessary, stir a tablespoon into the melted chocolate mix (drink the rest as a cook’s perk), then leave to cool slightly. Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4.Separate the eggs: I usually break them all into a large bowl and just scoop out the yolks, but if you’re worried about breaking the yolks, crack each egg one by one into a small bowl before separating them.View image in fullscreen5 Beat the egg yolks and sugarsPut the egg yolks and both sugars in a food mixer and whisk, scraping down the sides as necessary, until thickened, pale yellow and at least doubled in volume.View image in fullscreenThe mix should fall in broad ribbons from the whisk (or use a large bowl and hand beaters or, if you’re feeling energetic, a hand whisk).6 Add the cocoa and saltTurn off the machine, then sift the cocoa powder on top of the egg mixture (don’t just dump it in or you’ll end up with lumps).View image in fullscreenAdd the salt and any other flavourings you might fancy – a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg, ground cardamom, chilli, or a dash of vanilla, for example – then mix on a low speed until thoroughly combined.7 Whip the egg whitesPut the egg whites in a large bowl (you’ll need one that’s big enough to hold all the cake batter eventually) and whisk to soft peaks that hold their shape but flop over at the top.View image in fullscreenIf you have only one whisk, make sure you wash and dry it very well after using it for the egg yolk and cocoa mixture).8 Combine the chocolate and eggsUsing a large metal spoon, slowly and gently fold the melted chocolate mixture into the egg yolk mixture.View image in fullscreenFold in a third of the egg whites to loosen the batter, then very carefully and gently fold in the rest, until the mixture is no longer streaky but an even, rich brown. Sprinkle the cocoa nibs, if using, on top.9 Bake and coolView image in fullscreenSpoon the cake mix into the lined tin, then bake for 40-50 minutes, until just set on top, but still wobbly in the centre. Remove and leave to cool in the tin – and on no account attempt to unmould while it’s still warm.View image in fullscreenStore in a cool place (avoid refrigeration, if possible) and serve with something tart, such as citrus fruit and/or creme fraiche.Explore more on these topicsBakingFelicity Cloake's masterclassChocolateFoodEggsCakeSnacksDessertfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My aunt and cousins were joining us for dinner that evening and we had a meal to prepare. The local supermarket was closed and the cabbage, sourced from an Italian deli around the corner, was obscenely overpriced. In a bind, we bought some anyway and headed back home to begin cooking. Standing around the kitchen island chopping and peeling vegetables, preparing a rib of beef and assembling a side dish of dauphinoise potatoes, we listened to music and chatted. The meal was a success and the cabbage – lightly browned and decorated with caraway seeds – tasty. But most important was that, for the time we had spent cooking, I felt closer to my dad.The meal was a success but most important was that, for the time we had spent cooking, I felt closer to my dadThis kind of intimacy almost always occurs for me while I’m cooking with someone. When I was 14, I was paired with a classmate in food technology where we were tasked with making a meal from scratch. We decided on a menu of jerk chicken, rice and peas. For practice, we gathered a group of friends at my house and, after procuring our ingredients, got to work. The results of our efforts were average, but that joint experience of clumsily blitzing fiery scotch bonnet peppers, onions, garlic and various sauces into a clumpy and barely edible mess cemented our friendship.A year later, when my parents separated, cooking elaborate meals with my mum helped me feel less redundant in a situation that was out of my control. We’d make Caesar salads with homemade dressing (using crème fraîche instead of egg yolks), my mum toasting croutons as I bashed anchovies and garlic with a mortar and pestle, or spend hours slowly cooking rich ragù. In my mind at least, I was offering a sense of companionship that she may have felt was missing.Later, when my dad remarried, cooking with my stepsister – making everything from fried chicken to parmesan custard served with anchovy toast – solidified our bond as siblings. When I visited her recently in Newcastle, the whole trip revolved around the food we prepared: blackened fish and Old Bay-seasoned corn on the cob on one night, miso-butter mushrooms on another.Then there’s my dad. He’s a man of few words, but when we cook together we discuss films, music and books and update each other on our lives while chopping onions, preparing salads or making recipes fromA Taste of Our Cooking, a book of traditional Ismaili recipes. One dish in particular, a chicken pilau spiced with cumin, cloves and cardamon pods, reminds me of the food that my grandmother, who lived with us growing up, used to take to the mosque to share with others. Cooking it with my dad takes me back to that time. I’m often relegated to sous chef, but it’s our time together and I cherish it.“Food is at the centre of human connections,” explainsCharlotte Hastings, a psychotherapist and the author ofKitchen Therapy, a book which explores the psychological, social and spiritual aspects of food. “That’s how we began as a species: by making and enjoying food together. The way we cook gives us a way of expressing love between one another.”Hastings uses the shared language of cooking and food as a way to explore personal and interpersonal issues with her patients. It’s a technique, she says, that means she can move from emotionally difficult areas people are discussing to, say, whisking eggs, while drawing connections between their feelings and the food they’re preparing. “It allows us to stay in the room and not run away from those feelings, while not staying in a dangerous place for too long with people. It’s an effective way of working with trauma.”While the intimacy I find in cooking with friends and family doesn’t always involve spilling our deepest held secrets or emotional pain, She suggests that the active nature of preparing food means the pressure or anxiety some people may feel in one-on-one conversation slip away. “We’re feeling that sense of being unified,” she says. “You don’t have to be having really big, meaningful conversations to come away feeling sustained and nourished in those moments.”Dr Michael Kocet, assistant vice-chancellor for graduate education at the University of College Denver and a mental health counsellor who developed a graduate course that trains people how to use cooking in a therapeutic setting, agrees that cooking together creates a less threatening environment than sitting down face-to-face for a chat. “Research shows, especially with men and adolescents and boys, that parents often find their child opens up when they’re driving in the car. Why? Well, it’s because they’re not making eye contact. They’re focusing ahead, and that eye contact is less threatening,” he says. “It’s the same thing with cooking. It’s less intimidating, less vulnerable, because you’re focusing on a task of chopping or stirring or having a common activity together.”Having recently moved away from my family in London to live alone in Sheffield, I’ve found that cooking together with friends has also often soothed those moments where I’ve felt lonely or isolated. “I think food is a binding opportunity,” Kocet says. “It brings friends together. It might not even be about being a good chef. I think it’s just a way to foster community.”Leeds-based charityZestis putting this into practice with its social enterpriseLeeds Cookery School. Using profits made from hosting cookery classes for local foodies and hiring out their kitchens for corporate away days and private events, they offer a range of free-to-access community projects centred around education about health eating and the preparation and sharing of food. “Food crosses all barriers, languages and demographics,” says Joe Grant, who works as the charity’s head of social enterprise. “I could be sitting next to you and we could be talking in different languages. But if we were to cook a meal together and share it, there would be smiles, there would be laughter, there would be a connection, and there would be a bond that’s made.”Grant highlights two of the programmes that the organisation runs: theMen’s Pie Club, an initiative which was first set up by Newcastle-based social enterpriseFood Nationthat aims to combat social isolation among men of all ages, and theWelcome Café, Leeds, a community cooking session for refugees and asylum seekers living in the area.“The premise of the Pie Club is that socially isolated men can come to a session once a week, roll up their sleeves, make some pastry and a filling and produce a pie,” Grant says. “But the kinaesthetic act is somewhat secondary because they are having conversations. The pies just get made along the way.” He shares one story about a man who arrived at his first session with low confidence and social anxiety. “But since coming to the pie club, we saw that person come out of their shell,” Grant says. “Before too long, they were showing participants what to do and now that person is leading sessions.” Many of the men also go on to build friendships outside cooking. “They have a WhatsApp group. They go home and share their success and failures in pie making. It doesn’t have to be about in-depth chats. They’re making connections with people.”This is the ethos behind the Welcome Café, too. Each week one person decides what the group will cook and they stroll through Leeds Kirkgate Market to pick up ingredients before heading back to the kitchens in the market to prepare a meal. “We have people from Somalia, Algeria, Hong Kong,” Grant says. “It’s just so international and varied. There’s 18 to 80-year-olds and so many different personalities. They all chip in and it’s this one big community meal.”Despite the obvious benefits of sharing food together,a 2021 surveyconducted by Sainsbury’s found that only 28% of households eat the same meal at dinnertime, with 55% saying they struggle to find the time to dine together. Meanwhile,a 2016 studyfound that parents of 1.5 million families in the UK had never cooked with their children. Hastings puts this down to the separation of our minds and our bodies. “Obviously class and gender play into this, but I think in a capitalist culture we’ve lost the spiritual structure of making food as an act of love and communication. There’s this real disconnect around what the purpose of eating is,” she says. “It is difficult when people don’t have enough time, but we need to ask ourselveswhywe don’t have enough time.Where is that coming from?”“I don’t think it’s anybody’s fault: it’s the financial pressures, economic pressures and environmental pressures,” says Grant. “Life has just got so much faster, almost exponentially, over the past 20 years and convenience has accelerated that. It’s created this environment which doesn’t enable a family to have the luxury to make time to cook together, but that is so important.”A few weeks ago, after a rough few weeks for my mental health, I popped to a friend’s house for dinner. We stood in his kitchen dicing peppers, celery and onions that would make up the bastardised jambalaya I’ve been cooking for years. As I browned the chicken and he measured out the rice, we talked and soon the pressure that I’d felt building in my life began to ease. And when we sat down to eat, the results of the intimacy I had felt as we cooked tasted good.Explore more on these topicsFoodSelf and wellbeingHealth & wellbeingPsychologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Intensely fresh and fragrant, herbs are used liberally in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, and never as an afterthought or as mere garnish. In fact, entire bunches of basil, coriander and tarragon will often accompany grilled and roast meat from springtime right through to autumn, while bulgur salad is always more leaf than wheat; sorbet may be basil and soda is often tarragon, too. Walnuts are another mainstay of kitchens throughout the region, where they go into salads and cakes and, perhaps best of all, are ground into thick, rich sauces.Chicken with white wine and walnut sauce (pictured top)At a restaurant in Dilijan, northern Armenia, we ate roast chicken that, given its wine and walnut sauce, had a distinctly Georgian flavour. I suggest keeping things simple and serving this with just a green salad, a plate of sliced tomatoes or a cucumber and herb salad.Prep5 minCook1 hr 30 minServes41 whole free-range chicken without giblets(about 1½kg)Juice of ½ lemon, shell reserved1 tbsp olive oil1½ tsp sea salt flakesBlack pepper½ tsp sweet paprika½ tsp red pepper flakesFor the sauce60gwalnuts1 large garlic clove, peeled and roughly chopped½ tsp ground coriander¼ tsp ground blue fenugreek½ tsp ground cuminJuice of ½ lemon100mhot chicken stock2 tbsp white wineHeat the oven to 200C(180C fan)/400F/gas 6. Cut away and discard any fat from around the cavity of the chicken. Pour over the lemon juice, drizzle with the oil and season the bird inside and out. Sprinkle over the spices, then put the squeezed-out lemon half into the cavity.Lay the chicken breast side down in a roasting tin, then roast for an hour, until the juices run clear when you pierce the thickest part of the thigh and there is no pinkness to the meat. Cover, then put in a warm place to rest while you make the sauce.Toast the walnuts in a small, dry frying pan, then put them in a food processor and add all the remaining sauce ingredients bar the stock and wine. Blitz to a wet sand texture, then scrape into a saucepan and add the hot stock and any juices from the resting chicken. Simmer, stirring often, for 10 minutes, until thickened, then add the wine and cook again for a couple of minutes, until you have a hummus-like sauce. Take off the heat, leave to cool to room temperature, then check the seasoning.Serve the chicken hot or cold with the walnut sauce alongside.Citrus and walnut saladView image in fullscreenCaroline Eden’s citrus and walnut salad.Inspired by the vibrancy of theAslamazyan sisters’ work, this colourful salad demonstrates how Armenians often pair sweet with savoury and sharpness. Make this for meze-style lunch gatherings, or serve as a side to grilled meat and fish.Prep5 minCook20 minServes4, as a side70gwalnut halves1 small orange1 small, firm green apple2 celery sticks, chopped small and leaves reserved1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil1 tbsp lemon juiceSea salt andblack pepperBegin by toasting the nuts to bring out their flavour fully. Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4, then bake the walnut halves for about eight minutes – keep a close eye on them, and take them out of the oven once they smell roasted. Leave to cool, then break up the walnut halves into slightly smaller pieces.Peel the orange, then carefully pare off the white pith. Slice the orange in half, then pull out any seeds and cut the fruit into crescents. Core the apple (there’s no need to peel it) and cut it into thin half-moons.In a large bowl, combine all the salad ingredients with the olive oil and lemon juice, season well, toss and serve.These recipes are edited extracts from Green Mountains, by Caroline Eden, published by Quadrille at £28.

On the whole, though, the longer the feta has been aged, the punchier its finish will be. Young cheese needs only about two to three months to mature, and can vary in anything from its saltiness to its tanginess and strength. One thing is for certain, however: if the cheese is labelled “feta”, it will have been made in Greece due to a European PDO (protected designation of origin), so you can be assured that it’s the real deal and made with sheep’s milk, or a blend of sheep and goat’s milk.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

Try out a few brands for yourself, because the stronger ones can put people off.

Even after 25 years as a chef, I still love making them and, like most things, they taste better homemade.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.If you’ve cooked something like a creme brulee, mayo or carbonara, and have a few egg whites spare, today’s recipe is a fun and delicious way to turn waste into taste.Black treacle marshmallows with fennelI’m omnivorous now, but when I turned vegetarian at the age of 14 my mum would forcefeed me a spoon of black strap molasses every morning to boost my iron intake. Treacle and back strap molasses are byproducts of sugar refining, and a much healthier alternative, being full of vitamins, nutrients and minerals, including iron, calcium and potassium. And now that my daughter is mostly vegetarian, I garnish her porridge with treacle or molasses each morning, too.Inspired by my mother, I thought it would be a good idea to develop this marshmallow recipe with black treacle, for a slightly more nourishing take on marshmallows that I can share with my daughter. It has a strong and complex flavour that is a bit of an acquired taste, but one that’s well worth acquiring for the extra nutrients. If you are new to treacle, taste it first: if you find it too strong, mix it with either sugar, honey or maple syrup to reduce its intensity, or acquire the taste by adding it sparingly to your porridge as I did. The addition of ground fennel, meanwhile, gives these black treacle marshmallows a delicious liquorice note.Try this recipe and many more on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.This recipe is an adaptation ofDominique Ansel’s reliable method. Make sure you use a pan that’s large enough to allow the melted sugar to boil up the sides, because when you add the gelatine and water, it will rise considerably.To check if the sugar has reached the hard ball stage, or 125C (260F), without a thermometer, use the so-called cold water test: drop a little syrup into a bowl of cold water. If it forms a firm but pliable ball that holds its shape without flattening, it’s ready.MakesAbout 12Neutral oil, for greasingCornflour, for dusting100g sugar100g black strap molasses1 pinch salt30g honey160g water– 80g for blooming the gelatine, plus 80g for syrup12g gelatine powder3 egg whites2 tsp ground fennel seeds(optional)Icing sugar or finely ground brown sugar, for coatingBrush a 20cm square tin with a thin layer of oil, then dust it generously with cornflour.In a saucepan, combine the sugar, black strap molasses, salt and half the water, and fit the pan with a sugar thermometer, making sure the tip doesn’t touch the bottom. Bring to a boil on a medium heat, then pour in the honey – do not stir it! Leave to cook for eight to 12 minutes, until the mix hits the hard ball stage, or 125C, then take off the heat.In a small bowl, stir the gelatine powder into the remaining water until dissolved, then carefully add to the sugar mix – it will bubble up – then whisk until smooth.In a large bowl, whisk the egg whites to soft peaks. Beating continuously, slowly drizzle in the hot sugar syrup down the side of the bowl, and keep whisking until thick and glossy. Add the ground fennel, if using, and whisk again to combine.Pour the mix into the greased tin and tap firmly on the counter to knock out any air bubbles. Leave at room temperature to set for two to three hours, until firm to the touch.Dust the top of the set marshmallow mix with cornflour, then turn it out on to a board coated with a 50:50 mix of cornflour and icing sugar (or finely ground brown sugar) and another teaspoon of ground fennel, if using. Cut into cubes, then roll in the coating to stop them sticking together.Store at room temperature in an airtight container for up to a week, or in the fridge for up to a month.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteEggsSnacksfeaturesShareReuse this content"
