We’re simply not going to find a way to do that. The cap is popular with key voters, who see it as a matter of fairness,” one source said.In a letter toKeir Starmeron Tuesday, groups including Barnardo’s, Save the Children UK and Citizens Advice said scrapping the two-child benefit limit would be the most cost-effective way to reduce child poverty.The ChildPovertyAction Group, which signed the letter, estimated the number of children in poverty would increase from 4.5 million to 4.8 million by 2029 unless urgent action is taken.Child poverty predicted to rise in most of UK except ScotlandRead moreThe government is planning to publish its long-awaited child poverty strategy in June, around the time of the spending review, raising expectations the plan will come with funding attached to try to drive down poverty levels.The government is also launching its policy of introducing free breakfast clubs into all primary schools in England as part of an initiative to reduce child poverty. The first 750 clubs, providing 30 minutes of morning childcare, open on Tuesday as part of a trial before a national rollout.Ministers said the extra time could save parents £450 a year, if their child went every day, with up to £7,500 more saved by the provision of 30 hours of free childcare per week from September, up from 15 hours a week.The breakfast clubs policy is being promoted not only as a way to improve school attendance, educational performance and attainment, but also as a primary lever for reducing poverty, with 67,000 of the 180,000 pupils set to benefit coming from the most dis­advantaged areas of England.But Labour MPs said while they strongly supported breakfast clubs, they remained concerned the two-child cap, along with wider cuts to disability benefits, would drive more families with children into poverty.“Ditching the cap is by far the most effective way of tackling child poverty. We have a moral obligation to do this,” one MP said. “I’m afraid they’ll use the breakfast clubs to soften us up to tell us the two-child benefit cap remains.”Ministers are still looking at ways to alleviate the impact of the two-child limit for universal credit or child tax credit, imposed by the Conservatives in 2017, without spending the £3.6bn required to remove it entirely.Among the options is applying the limit only to those with children who are five and over, exempting parents of disabled children or parents in work, and increasing child benefit payments for parents of young children. A separate proposal for a three-child limit has also been discussed.Charities have called for Labour ministers to ditch the benefits restriction as part of the child poverty plan, warning that a failure to do could mean child poverty levels soaring by the end of this parliament.In their letter to Starmer, they said: “Scrapping the two-child limit is by far the most cost-effective way to reduce child poverty. It would lift 350,000 children out of poverty overnight and result in 700,000 children living in less deep poverty.“If it is not scrapped, the stark reality is that child poverty will be significantly higher at the end of this parliament than when the government took office, making this the first time a Labour government would leave such a legacy.”However, aides said there was little political appetite within No 10 to lift the cap entirely, with polls suggesting that voters support it. Others have suggested the tight fiscal circumstances mean ministers will not change track, despite some feeling the limit is overly punitive.Explore more on these topicsPovertyCharitiesBenefitsChildrenKeir StarmerTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

His cause of death was confirmed through an ECG test, the Vatican said.Francis, who twice almost died when hospitalised with severe pneumonia in February, also suffered from multiple bronchiectasis, arterial hypertension and type 2 diabetes.The pope confirmed in his will that he wished to be buried at Santa Maria Maggiore church in Rome’s Esquilino neighbourhood, breaking with longstanding Vatican tradition. He would pray at the basilica before and after trips overseas, and last visited on 12 April.The text of his will specified that Francis wanted to be buried “in the ground, without particular decoration” but with the inscription of his papal name in Latin: Franciscus.Popes are usually buried with much fanfare in the grottoes beneath St Peter’s Basilica inVatican City, but Francis – loved by many Catholics for his humility – simplified rites for papal funerals last year.The Guardian view on Pope Francis: an outsider who was a force for good in the world | EditorialRead moreIn the text of his will that was published by the Vatican, the late pope said: “The cost of preparing the burial will be covered by a sum provided by a benefactor, which I have arranged to be transferred to the Papal Basilica of Saint Mary Major. I have given the necessary instructions regarding this to Cardinal Rolandas Makrickas, Extraordinary Commissioner of the Liberian Basilica.”His body was transferred into a coffin in the chapel of Casa Santa Marta on Monday night. The coffin will be taken to St Peter’s basilica on Wednesday morning to allow the public to pay their respects.Cardinals will meet on Tuesday morning to decide the date of the pope’s funeral, which must take place between four and six days after death. The funeral will be followed by nine days of official mourning.1:58How international news channels announced the death of Pope Francis – videoThousands of pilgrims and tourists flocked to St Peter’s Square, where prayers for the pope were held on Monday evening.Francis, who had chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, wasadmitted to Gemelli hospitalin Rome on 14 February for a respiratory crisis that developed into double pneumonia. He spent 38 days there, the longest hospitalisation of his 12-year papacy.He wasdischarged from hospitalon 23 March and made his last public appearanceon Sunday, when he did a tour of St Peter’s Square in the popemobile and gave a brief greeting from the central balcony of St Peter’s basilica.Amid intense mourning over the coming days and weeks, manoeuvring within the Vatican over who is to succeed Francis and become the 268th head of the Catholic church is certain to begin. Cardinals from around the world will head to Rome for a conclave, the secret, complex election ritual held in the Sistine Chapel involving about 138 cardinals who are eligible to vote.The conclave must begin its deliberations within 20 days of the pope’s death.Some of the potential contenders mooted before Francis’s death were Matteo Zuppi, a progressive Italian cardinal, Pietro Parolin, who serves as the Vatican’s secretary of state, and Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, from the Philippines.Political and religious leaders around the world pay tribute to Pope FrancisRead moreKing Charles said he and the queen – who met the pope in Rome last week – had “heavy hearts” at the news of his death, adding that Francis would be remembered for his compassion and tireless commitment.President Trump said he would attend Francis’s funeral, posting on social media: “Rest in Peace Pope Francis! May God Bless him and all who loved him!” Former president Joe Biden said Francis would be “remembered as one of the most consequential leaders of our time”, and Barack Obama said he was a “rare leader who made us want to be better people”.In Italy, Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister, said: “I had the privilege of enjoying his friendship, his advice and his teachings, which never failed even in moments of trial and suffering.”The pontiff’s death is likely to exacerbate sharp divisions within the curia, with conservatives seeking to wrest control of the church away from reformers.During his 12-year papacy, Francis – the first Jesuit pope – was a vocal champion of the world’s poor, dispossessed and disadvantaged, and a blunt critic of corporate greed and social and economic inequality. Within the Vatican, he criticised extravagance and privilege, calling on church leaders to show humility.His views riled significant numbers of cardinals and powerful Vatican officials, who often sought to frustrate Francis’s efforts to overhaul the ancient institutions of the church. But his compassion and humanity endeared him to millions around the world.Francis, who was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1936, and was elected pope in March 2013. He immediately signalled his style of papacy by taking the bus, rather than papal car, to his hotel, where he paid his bill before moving into the Vatican guesthouse, eschewing the opulent papal apartments. At his first media appearance, he expressed his wish for a “poor church and a church for the poor”.He focused papal attention on poverty and inequality,calling unfettered capitalism the “dung of the devil”. Two years into his papacy, he issued an180-page encyclical on the environment, demanding the world’s richest nations pay their “grave social debt” to the poor. The climate crisis represented “one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day”, the pope said.He called for compassion for and generosity towards refugees, saying theyshould not be treated as “pawns on the chessboard of humanity”. After visiting the Greek island of Lesbos,he offered 12 Syrians refuge at the Vatican. During his recent period in hospital, he kept up his telephone calls to the Holy Family church in Gaza, a nightly routine since 9 October 2023.One of the biggest issues with which Francis had to contend was that of clerical sexual abuse and the church’s cover-up of crimes committed by priests and bishops. In the first few years of his papacy, as wave after wave of scandals engulfed the church, Francis was accused by survivors and others of failing to understand the scale of the crisis and the urgent need to proactively root out abuse and its cover-up.In 2019, Francissummoned bishopsfrom around the world to Rome to discuss the crisis and laterissued an edictrequiring priests and nuns to report sexual abuse and its cover-up to the church authorities, and guaranteeing protection for whistleblowers. It was a significant move towards the church taking responsibility for the scandals, and went much further than his predecessors.Also during his tenure as the head of the Catholic church, Francis was obliged to respond to repeated acts of terrorism and persecution. He was at pains to stress that violence had no part to play in true practice of religion, and that people should not conflate acts of terrorism with Islam. “I think it is not right to identify Islam with violence,”he said after the murder of a Catholic priestin France in 2016. “I think that in nearly all religions there is always a small fundamentalist group,” he said, adding: “We [Catholics] have them.”Francis spoke with compassion on issues of sexuality (famously responding“who am I to judge?”to a question about gay priests), the family and the role of women in society – while adhering to traditional Catholic doctrine on marriage, contraception and abortion. Although many on the left strove to claim Francis as one of their own, he could not easily be defined as liberal or conservative.On his many trips abroad, Francis was greeted like a rock star, with hundreds of thousands – sometimes millions – waiting for hours for a glimpse of the diminutive, white-robed figure in his open-sided popemobile. His appeal was particularly strong among young people, whom he frequently urged to reject materialism and overdependence on technology. “Happiness … is not an app that you can download on your phones,” Francistold Catholic youth in April 2016.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisCatholicismChristianityReligionThe papacynewsShareReuse this content"

But it found that several of those it tested failed basic electrical safety standards.The UK consumer organisation has carried out numerous investigations in recent years, which commonly found that cheap, unbranded electronics bought onlineare often unsafe.It said its latest findings underlined the need for “tough new laws” to make online marketplaces responsible for ensuring the safety of the products offered on their platforms.There have been warnings for years about plug-in devices that supposedly help people save on their energy costs but that can ultimately pose a risk of fire or electrocution. In 2011, the Guardian reported onan alert issued by trading standards officersabout an unsafe plug-in device that claimed it could save users 40% on energy bills.The UK’s Office for Product Safety and Standardslater recalled several devicesavailable to buy via online marketplaces, citing “a serious risk” of fire and electric shock.Those selling the plugs often claim they can save customers money on their electricity bills by “stabilising” voltage and “balancing” the electric current to “optimise” the performance of household appliances.However, Which? said its researchers tested eight devices from sites including Amazon, eBay, AliExpress, Shein and Temu, and found no evidence that they worked.“More concerningly, they failed basic electrical safety standards, meaning they are illegal and potentially dangerous,” said a spokesperson.Many of the devices made “dubious” energy-saving claims, said Which?, and had attracted a raft of poor customer reviews.Which? said most of the items its researchers looked at had poor-quality soldering, contained too much lead and were potentially unsafe.The government’s product regulation and metrology bill isgoing through parliament, and the consumer body said ministers must ensure these new laws gave online marketplaces “clear legal responsibilities” for keeping potentially dangerous products off their sites, “backed up by tough enforcement, including heavy fines, when businesses fall short”.All the companies told Which? they had removed the relevant product listings.An eBay spokesperson told the Guardian it used a number of its own measures aimed at preventing unsafe and prohibited listings, and as a result had removed the listings in question before Which? notified it that the products were unsafe.Shein said it “takes product safety very seriously … Upon learning of any claims, Shein immediately removes the item(s) from its site as a precaution while the company investigates.”Temu said it “requires traders to meet the safety standards of the markets they are selling to”, and that in this case, its monitoring had flagged the product and removed it from the platform before Which? got in touch.An Amazon spokesperson said: “We require all products to comply with applicable laws and regulations, and we take action to maintain a safe selection for our customers. These products have been removed.”A spokesperson for AliExpress told Which? that third-party sellers must comply with the law and with its platform rules, adding: “The listings of the product that failed Which?’s test have been removed.”Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsConsumer rightsEnergy billsEnergy efficiencyHousehold billsOnline shoppingnewsShareReuse this content"

He is seen as one of the less hardline US voices on trade.However, she is expected to underline that the UK will not strike a deal at any cost. Speaking before she left for the US, she said: “Any deal that is able to be secured will always have front and centre British national interest.”The IMF’s spring meetings will take place against the most fraught economic backdrop since the Covid pandemic, with Trump’s trade barriers weighing heavily on big economies including the EU, China and the US itself.The IMF is expected to downgrade its expectations of global growth and warn of the growing risk of financial instability when its latest forecasts are published on Tuesday.The chancellor is also expected to hold a series of bilateral discussions with other international finance ministers as they scramble to respond to the White House’s policies, amid fresh evidence that the chaos unleashed in financial markets by Trump’s tariffs is far from over.On Monday, while markets in the UK were closed for the bank holiday, US government bonds – known as Treasuries – and the dollar were hit by a wave of selling on Wall Street.Investors have been rattled by Trump’s criticism of the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, for failing to cut interest rates. The White House adviser Kevin Hassett has suggested the president is examining whether he has the power to fire Powell.UK officials are pessimistic about their chances of persuading Trump to give them an exemption from his 10% global tariff, but they hope to be able to agree reductions to the 25% rates being promised on certain items.Ministers have offered a series of concessions to the US, including tax cuts for tech companies, in the hope of getting these levies lifted.

On Sunday, it said an internal investigation had “identified several professional failures, breaches of orders, and a failure to fully report the incident”.Gaza’s civil defence agency, which rescues victims of airstrikes, dismissed the Israeli army report, accusing the military of lying in an attempt to justify targeting the rescue convoys.“The video filmed by one of the paramedics proves that the Israeli occupation’s narrative is false and demonstrates that it carried out summary executions,” Mohammed al-Mughair, a civil defence official, told Agence-France Presse on Monday, accusing Israel of seeking to “circumvent” its obligations under international law.Jonathan Whittall, the UN’s humanitarian chief for Gaza, said the investigation did not go far enough. “A lack of real accountability undermines international law and makes the world a more dangerous place,” he said.“Without accountability, we risk continuing to watch atrocities unfolding, and the norms designed to protect us all eroding.”Nebal Farsakh, a spokesperson for the PRCS, said: “The report is full of lies. It is invalid and unacceptable, as it justifies the killing and shifts responsibility to a personal error in the field command when the truth is quite different.”The PRCS has previously called for an international investigation into the incident.Sunday’s IDF report said the deputy commander of the Golani Brigade would be dismissed owing to his responsibilities in the field and for “providing an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief”. Another commander, whose unit was also operating in the area, would be disciplined for “his overall responsibility for the incident”, the military said.According to the IDF, soldiers fired on the humanitarian workers travelling in ambulances and a fire truck because of “poor night visibility” and soldiers then violated orders by shooting at a UN vehicle which drove past 15 minutes later, resulting in the death of the driver.The bodies and vehicles were put in a sandy mass grave that could not be accessed by a UN retrieval team until several days later, after which the UN said the medics had been killed “one by one” and two witnesses claimed at least one victim had his hands and feet bound.Postmortem results released last weekshowed that the men were mostly killed by “gunshots to the head and torso”as well as injuries caused by explosives, and none of the victims had visible signs of restraint.The army denied in its report that there had been “indiscriminate fire” and maintained that six of the killed men were Hamas militants, allegations the humanitarian agencies involved deny. None of those killed were armed.During 18 months of war, Israeli forces have killed hundreds of medical workers and the staff of aid agencies and UN organisations in Gaza. In April last year, seven members of the charity World Central Kitchen died in a sustained Israeli attack on their clearly marked vehicles.Human rights organisations have long accused the Israeli military of a culture of impunity, with few soldiers ever facing justice. In 2023, fewer than 1% of complaints made against Israeli troops in the occupiedPalestinian territoriesended in a conviction, according to the latest US state department annual human rights report.Dan Owen, a researcher who analyses army data for the Israeli human rights organisation Yesh Din, said the vast majority of incidents go unreported.Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave in Gaza. This must never happen again | Jagan ChapagainRead moreThe IDF is yet to respond to a Yesh Din request made in June 2024 under freedom of information laws regarding the number of investigations and indictments in cases in which soldiers are suspected of harming civilians in the war in Gaza.In August last year, the military said it had received approximately 1,000 complaints filed by lawyers and human rights groups related to the Gaza war, and had opened 74 investigations. Four concerned the deaths of Palestinians held in Israeli detention, eight concerned allegations of torture in prisons, and the rest were related to property damage and theft.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Yet here we have a private sector enterprise, travel and tourism, contributing 10% of UK GDP, creating jobs, but we are not prioritising it in any way. We are sabotaging ourselves.”Retailers including the boss of luxury brand Burberry have said that the scrapping of a VAT tax break for tourists has put the UK at a“competitive disadvantage for global shoppers”.“The UK is losing value share compared to other European partners,” said Simpson, speaking to the Press Association.She also criticised the decision to cut tourism authority VisitBritain’s budget by 44% this year.On 1 April, VisitBritain’s “Great Britain and Northern Ireland” destination promotion programme budget was cut to £10.57m, from £18.85m last year. On the same day, air passenger duty for many visitors to the UK increased.A day later, the requirement for the £10 electronic travel authorisation (ETA) was imposed on all European visitors, apart from the Irish, and has since increased to £16.Millions of tourists in UK could be asked to pay local visitor levyRead more“You need to sell the UK,” said Simpson. “It’s really important that you create stories about the UK so that international visitors come to all our regions. You need to sell Harry Potter. You need to sell Jane Austen. You need to sell Richard III.”A government spokesperson said that VisitBritain’s campaign “remains an effective tool driving economic growth”.“The UK is one of the most visited countries in the world and international tourism drives billions into our economy,” said the spokesperson. “We are supporting the continued growth of this industry and will be launching a national visitor economy strategy this autumn to help meet our ambition to welcome 50 million international visitors a year to the UK by 2030.”The WTTC study, produced in collaboration with consultancy OxfordEconomics, also found that travel and tourism contributed £286bn to the UK’s economy in 2024, up 3.9% from 2019.Explore more on these topicsEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicsEconomic policyAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

Authorities were alerted to her disappearance on 13 April by an electronic monitoring system.Since Russia launched its military offensive inUkrainein February 2022, authorities have launched thousands of cases against people accused of discrediting the army.Barabash had written for several news outlets, including Republic and the Russian service of Radio France Internationale.She had been an outspoken critic of Moscow’s military offensive on Ukraine, writing on Facebook in March 2022 that Russia had “bombed the country” and “razed whole cities to the ground”.Russia, which denies targeting civilians, made it illegal to criticise the army and its military operations in Ukraine shortly after its offensive began.Rights groups said authorities are using the law to wage an unprecedented crackdown on dissent reminiscent of the Soviet era.Fleeing house arrest is risky in Russia, but not unheard of.

[For] April to date, rainfall figures are well below where they should be.”The average rainfall figure for April nationally is 71mm but the UK has only had 27.2mm so far, or 38% of the April average.Tuesday is expected to get off to a chilly start with a lot of dry and fine weather between a few isolated showers.Stroud added: “It will cloud over from the west late in the day, with a band of heavy rain and strong and gusty winds arriving across England and Wales, pushing into Northern Ireland, southern Scotland during the overnight period into Wednesday morning.“That air of rain is not hanging around, it’s actually moving quite quickly south and eastwards across the country.“So conditions will improve significantly during the course of the afternoon.“Sunny spells and showers is the name of the game on Wednesday afternoon, and that leads quite nicely into a generally dry and settled spell of weather on Thursday.“But that too will be very short lived, with another band of cloud and rain slowly edging in from the west towards the end of the week, and more especially next weekend.”The driest and brightest skies will be in the eastern parts of the country, while it will be wet and cloudy in parts of Wales, central southern England and Northern Ireland.View image in fullscreenA helicopter douses a wildfire with water on the Isle of Bute on 10 April.Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty ImagesThe UK has had one of the worst wildfire seasons on record following one of the driest Marches in decades combined with warmer than average temperatures in April.Abergwesyn Common in Powys, Wales wasconsumed by a 1,600 hectare (3,950 acre) fire, an area roughly 400 times the size of Cardiff’s Principality Stadium.Last week, Wales’s three fire services said they had responded to more than 1,300 grass fires this year.On the Mourne Mountains in Northern Ireland, recent fires scorched land used by wildlife including small heath butterflies, rove beetles, skylarks and peregrine falcons.At Howden Moor in the Peak District, the National Trust said a recent fire that stretched for about three miles had caused £30,000 worth of damage.Explore more on these topicsUK weathernewsShareReuse this content"

The fruit shared was tested for alcohol content. The highest level found was the equivalent of 0.61% alcohol by volume (ABV).“Chimps don’t share food all the time, so this behaviour with fermented fruit might be important,” said Kimberley Hockings, also from the University of Exeter.Though the alcohol level is relatively low, the chimpanzees ate a lot of fruit every day so might ingest a fair quantity of alcohol, she said. “They can feed on kilograms of the stuff every day. It’s probably analogous to us sipping on a light beer.”Hockings and her colleagues published a paper in 2015 describing how chimpanzees in west Africastole and consumed palm sap alcohol created by humans. Some of them appeared to become troublesome, causing mischief such as not letting others build their night nests.The researchers behind the latest study, however, said chimpanzees were unlikely to get “drunk” on the breadfruit because it would not improve their survival chances.The sharing seemed to take place between all ages and sexes. Two adult females, nicknamed Chip and Até, were seen ignoring a larger hunk of breadfruit in favour of a smaller but fermented piece.Two adult males, Mandjambé and Gary, were observed approaching ripe breadfruit with aggressive stances. Mandjambé claimed a piece and began to feed, while another adult male, Bobby, kept Gary at bay. They all had a taste of the ripe breadfruit in the vicinity in the end.The paper, which appears in the journalCurrent Biologywith the title “Wild chimpanzees share fermented fruits”, asks the question: “Do the origins of feasting behaviour derive from a shared common ancestor?”Hockings said: “We need to find out more about whether the chimpanzees deliberately seek out ethanolic fruits and how they metabolise it, but this behaviour could be the early evolutionary stages of feasting. If so, it suggests the human tradition of feasting may have its origins deep in our evolutionary history.”She said the number of observations was small but they could lead to “an explosion” of research into the topic.Explore more on these topicsAnimal behaviourBiologyAnimalsGuinea-BissauAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It seems that my brother cardinals have come almost to the ends of the earth to get him.”The wry observation struck a winning self-deprecatory note. But the Argentinian pope’s allusion to his outsider status was telling: having been chosen by his peers, Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio intended his to be a far more radical and reforming papacy than the conclave had bargained for. In the 13th century, St Francis of Assisi is said to have received the divine instruction: “Go, rebuild my house.” The first Pope to take the saint’s name viewed his own task in similar terms.Under the scholarly and traditionalist Benedict XVI, a bunker mentality had developed in Rome. Increasingly, the German pope had defined the church through its hostility to ongoing secularisation and alleged relativism in the west. TheVatileaks affair, evidence of high-level financial corruption and, above all, public outrage atrevelations of clerical sexual abuseplunged the church into a reputational nadir. Within the Vatican itself, poisonous cliques fought to preserve and extend their power bases, with the increasingly frail Benedict only nominally in charge.Francis’s approach was to follow in the footsteps of one of his heroes, Pope John XXIII, who said on the eve of the modernisingSecond Vatican Councilin 1962 that he wished to “open the window and let in some fresh air”. In a memorable dressing down of the Vatican’s civil service, the first non-European Pope of modern times railed against a “pathology of power” and excoriated insiders who “feel themselves ‘lord of the manor’ – superior to everyone and everything”. The Roman Catholic church, he said, needed to “come out of herself and go to the peripheries”; to become “a church of the poor for the poor” and a “field hospital for the faithful”. Over the next decade, traditional Franciscan themes of poverty, humility, solidarity with the poor and with the natural environment dominated the style and substance of the new papacy.View image in fullscreenPope John XXIII, a hero of Francis, who called the Second Vatican Council to ‘let in some fresh air’.Photograph: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Getty ImagesHis decision to live simply in a clerical guest house inVaticanCity, rather than the papal palace, made for a dramatic contrast with Benedict’s grander lifestyle and taste for ceremonial splendour. A plain white cassock and black boots, and a blue Ford Focus for getting around instead of a papal limousine, sent a message regarding what a “poor church” should look like. Financial structures that were all but unregulated began to be reformed, as the Vatican bank was required to conform to Council of Europe anti-money laundering rules, and an independent auditor general was appointed.Initially, much of this was so novel and, to a progressive eye so beguiling, that some western liberals were tempted almost to view Francis as one of their own.Time magazine made him its man of the year, the Gawker celebrity website hailed him as “our new cool Pope”, and on what used to be Twitter, some hailed him “#BestPopeEver”. A piece of street art in Rome portraying the pontiff as Superman was enthusiastically tweeted out by the Vatican.The intensity of that love affair was never going to last. An early informal conversation with journalists caused widespread astonishment when the pope replied “Who am I to judge?” to a question about gay people in the church. But well over a decade later there isno question of the Roman Catholic Church endorsing same-sex marriage. A more compassionate approach was being signalled, but in doctrinal termsFrancis remained firmlywithin the letter of existing canon law.Francis’s great ecclesiastical listening exercise, thesynod on synodality, also underwhelmed progressives, having been viewed as a chance for bottom-up reform. Whilewomen have been given significant new rolesand powers as Francis sought to reform the church’s decision-making processes, the question of female priests remains firmly off the agenda. On abortion, Francis strongly championed the church’s pro-life stance, andshared platforms with Italy’s Giorgia Meloniand Hungary’s Viktor Orbán to lament falling European birthrates.It would be a mistake, therefore, to view Francis’s papacy as a liberal one, but in significant areas it exerted a major progressive influence beyond the church, especially in relation to the climate emergency and the treatment of people migrating between countries.The 2015 papal encyclical,Laudato Si’, subtitled ‘On Care for Our Common Home’, made headlines around the world and offered a powerful critique of unregulated capitalism’s destructive effect on the planet. Delivering the church’s weightiest and most trenchant analysis of the implications of global heating, Francis’s call to hear “the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor” linked the causes of social and environmental justice. At Cop climate summits – which in 2023 he missed due to poor health – the pope repeatedlyemphasised the responsibility of the developed worldto mitigate the impact on poorer nations of its unsustainable consumption of resources.As the son of Italian immigrants to Argentina, Francis invested personal passion into his advocacy on behalf of migrants. Laudato Si’ noted that, for economic and climate-related reasons, mass migration would be a permanent 21st-century phenomenon. As western governments have increasingly battened down the hatches and adopted draconian short-term responses to the new reality, the pope at times appeared a lonely and isolated ally of millions of vulnerable people on the move.View image in fullscreenFrancis, standing second left, with his two brothers, two sisters and parents, both Italian immigrants who settled in Argentina.Photograph: API/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesSoon after taking office, he visited the Italian island of Lampedusa where he condemnedEuropean “indifference”to the drowning of people crossing the Mediterranean in small boats. In subsequent years, there were numerous visits to camps for such people, where millions live what the pope described as “ghost” lives in limbo. On two occasions, the papal plane returned from the Greek island of Lesbos with migrating Muslim families onboard. Visiting a camp of 600,000 Muslim Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh in 2017, Francis spelled out the gospel imperative to see Christ in the stranger and the outsider,asserting that “the presence of God today is called Rohingya”.In an era in which politicians such as Donald Trump, Meloni and Orbán have weaponise Christian identity, this dimension of Francis’s papacy was a corrective and a crucial act of witness. It was supplemented by an effort to improve inter-faith dialogue with Islam, symbolised by aremarkable meeting with Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistaniduring a historic papal visit to Iraq.The rationale behind such initiatives was outlined in the 2020 encyclical,Fratelli Tutti(Brothers All), and Let Us Dream, a short reflection on the Covid pandemic. In both texts, the notion of a “common home” was deployed as a counter to the polarising politics of xenophobic nationalism. In Let Us Dream, Francis argued that the pandemic taught us that “no one is saved alone”, pointing the way to a new humanism, in which “we … let ourselves be touched by others’ pain” and act to alleviate it. Attacks on right-wing populism were accompanied by a savage indictment of western selfishness, consumerism and self-absorption. Francis’s extraordinarylocking of hornswith the United States’ Catholic vice-president JD Vance after Vance attempted to theologically justify the Trump administration’sdrivetowards mass deportations in the first weeks of the president’s second term was a high profile salvo in this battle.Such interventions naturally ensured the bitter enmity of the the Roman Catholic right. In the US, a narrow focus on reproductive rights and sexuality came to define Catholicism’s presence in the public square during the papacies of John Paul II and Benedict. Francis’s emphasis on mercy rather than judgmentand his scorn for laissez-faire capitalism was treated with outright hostility by traditionalists. After he opened the door for divorced and civilly remarried Roman Catholics to receive communion in 2016, the US cardinal Raymond Burke, a Trump supporter, publicly ruminated over the grounds on which thevalidity of Francis’s election as popemight be disputed. The late Australian cardinal, George Pell, whom Francis had appointed to oversee his anti-corruption strategy,wrotein an anonymous memo thatFrancis’s papacy had been a “catastrophe”.The traditionalists now have their chance. The next conclave will be defined by a struggle between those who want to turn the clock back to the time of John Paul II and Benedict, and those fighting to defend Francis’s essentially progressive legacy.Did Francis successfully “rebuild” the church? In 2018, he lamented that “reforming Rome is like cleaning the Sphinx of Egypt with a toothpick”. Evidence of clerical sexual abuse and attempted cover-ups has continued to emerge in recent years. But new “zero tolerance” policies towards offenders are in place, along with measures holding bishops and prelates to account over how they deal with instances of abuse. On corruption, the record has been mixed, largely because of stubborn internal resistance.Francis did his best to make the church a less Eurocentric institution, using his powers to increase the proportion of cardinals from Asia, Africa and Latin America. He enjoyed a deep reservoir of support among the laity, and was a source of optimism and hope for many disillusioned Roman Catholics. In challenging times, he was an influential ally to secular liberal movements.For a pope intent on finding a way back to the more open spirit of Vatican II, after a long conservative interregnum, it is an imperfect record, but not a bad one. The outsider from Buenos Aires used his power and charisma effectively, in order to shape a more outwards-facing, generous-spirited and socially-engaged church. We will now find out how durable that influence will be.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisThe papacyVaticanCatholicismReligionItalyChristianityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He may have come a distant second in the previous papal conclave in 2005, but at 76 and, following the resignation on the grounds of old age of the candidate who had come first back then, the 85-year-oldBenedict XVI– Bergoglio was convinced that a younger man was needed.However, the majority of cardinals who gathered in the Sistine Chapel to vote were looking for something more than (relative) youth. Top of their agenda as they assembled was openness to fresh thinking after 35 years of no change under the almost seamless reigns ofPope John Paul IIand Benedict, his erstwhile right-hand man. And so they surprised everyone by opting for Catholicism’s first Jesuit pope, the first Latin American successor to Saint Peter, and first leader from outside Europe in over a millennium.The break with tradition that Francis, who has died aged 88 after suffering from double pneumonia, represented even managed to trump the shock value of theresignation of Benedict, who was the first pope for 600 years to take that option rather than die in office. Immediately, Bergoglio signalled unambiguously that he intended to be a different kind of pope, one for the 21st century. He boldly chose to be known as Francis, becoming the first pontiff to take on the name of the radical saint from Assisi who had turned his back on privilege and status in this world, and lived with and for the poor. No more pomp and ceremony, the new pope seemed to be saying, but sleeves rolled up and joining the fight for social and economic justice.On that night of his election he stepped out on to the balcony overlooking Saint Peter’s Square in simple white robes, refusing the fancy red mozzetta or cape that Benedict had sported when he had been announced as pope. When told to put on white trousers, he later remembered in his autobiography, he replied: “I don’t want to be an ice-cream seller.”Smiling winningly, Francis described himself as an outsider, someone “from the end of the world”, who wanted to “walk together and work together” with the crowds who greeted him, rather than tell them what to do.View image in fullscreenCardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, archbishop of Buenos Aires, walking out on to the balcony overlooking St Peter’s Square after being elected Pope in 2013.Photograph: Lucas Oleniuk/Toronto Star/Getty ImagesThe excitement was palpable for believers and non-believers alike. Next, Francis declined to move into the gilded papal apartment vacated by his predecessor. Instead he was going to remain in the small room in the Santa Marta hostel in the Vatican where he had stayed during the conclave.This personal modesty never wavered in all his years in Rome. He picked up his own phone, shunned limos and preferred to walk if possible (sciatica later caused him to use a wheelchair) – as, for example, on the day after his election when he slipped away on foot to collect his suitcase and settle the bill at the modestpensionewhere he had been booked in before the conclave began. If it had to be four wheels, he took a bus, or frequently squeezed his bulky frame into the papalFiat 500saloon.“Bergoglio was a once-in-a-generation combination of two qualities seldom found together,” his biographer Austen Ivereigh wrote. “He had the political genius of a charismatic leader and the prophetic holiness of a desert saint.”He set out immediately to show there was substance behind his eye-catching gestures. In hisfirstUrbi et Orbi(To the City and the World) Easter address, he took aim at capitalism as “greed looking for easy gain” and condemned “the iniquitous exploitation of natural resources”. Next, on his way back from his first overseas trip as pope – to Brazil in July 2013 – he was asked by a journalist abouthis attitude to homosexuality. His predecessor had described same-sex attraction as a “strong tendency to an intrinsic moral evil”.Francis replied: “If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?” It was an indication of the extent of how out of touch the institution he was leading had become that no previous pope had ever even used the word “gay”. On questions of gender and sex, he remained unusually relaxed for a Catholic leader. “They are really not the most serious [sins],” he wrote in 2025.The papacy has for centuries brought with it a place on the world stage. Francis, who from the off gave the impression of being a man in a hurry, was determined to use that platform to push a bottom-up agenda for the world. He insisted thatCatholicismwould henceforth be “a poor church for the poor”, and returned time and again in his pronouncements to the need to close the economic gap between developed and developing nations.View image in fullscreenPope Francis praying in the ruins of a devastating earthquake in Amatrice, Italy, in 2016.Photograph: Osservatore Romano/EPAIt was a crusade that saw him take a leading role in tackling the challenges faced by a warming planet, castigating and chivvying politicians who refused to grasp the threat posed to the future of humanity by climate change. His May 2015 encyclical,Laudato Si’(Praise Be to You), an impassioned cry of pain at what was happening to the Earth and especially to its poorest, most vulnerable inhabitants because climate change was going unchecked, was read widely outside the usual Catholic circles. It is held by many experts to have galvanised those who gathered in Paris at the end of that year to set a target of limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees.Francis had emphasised the urgency of the task – in line with what other campaigners were saying – but he also managed to add a vital injection of hope with his insistence that concerted action could bring an earthly salvation for humankind. With his emphasis on accepting the science (he was a trained chemist) – and hence his stern rebuke to the climate change deniers and the politicians who courted them – he even managed to reset the relationship between science and religion, which had been rocky ever since Galileo fell foul of the Inquisition 400 years earlier.That momentum continued after Paris. In 2019 he called an unprecedentedsynodof bishops for the pan-Amazon region. Brazil’s new hard right president,Jair Bolsonaro, had made it plain that he was happy to see the rainforest go up in flames. Francis’s response was to use the papacy’s global reach to give voice to the fears of the 33 million people living in the Amazon basin who felt themselves to be powerless in shaping their own and the planet’s future. At the gathering, the crimes and injustice meted out by politicians and multinationals were called out as destructive of livelihoods as well as of Earth’s greatest store of carbon.For Francis, climate change, migration and global poverty were interconnected. In his first pastoral visit outside Rome following his election, hetravelled in July 2013to the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa off the coast of north Africa to meet the migrants and refugees who were arriving there in ever-greater numbers. With European governments keen only to find ways of “sending them back”, Francis spoke out against such “global indifference” to their plight, and called for a “reawakening of conscience” in wealthy nations. It was a message he reiterated in two trips,in April 2016and December 2021, to the Greekisland of Lesbos, close to the Turkish coast, where migrants were once again arriving.View image in fullscreenPope Francis visiting Muskwa Park in Alberta, Canada, in 2022, during what he described as a ‘penitential journey’ to apologise to Indigenous survivors of historic child abuse committed at Catholic-run institutions in Canada.Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/AFP/Getty ImagesOverall, the pattern of his overseas trips showed him unafraid, even eager, to head for the world’s hotspots –Jerusalem(2014),Bosnia and Herzegovina(2015),EgyptandMyanmar(2017),Iraq (2021)andSouth Sudan(2023). He went not as a war correspondent, or as a politician polishing their all-action image, but instead in the hope that his presence might make some difference to those who were suffering, whatever their faith or none, by reassuring them the world had not forgotten them.Yet if this outward-facing aspect of his ministry made a largely positive impact at a time when public trust in their leaders was falling to new lows, the fruits of his custodianship of the Catholic church itself were more mixed. That he managed to alienate both progressives and traditionalists in the pews reveals the middle course he tried to chart, ultimately satisfying neither group in an increasingly polarised 1.2 billion-strong institution.While his two predecessors had been authoritarians – they knew what they thought on the most contentious matters within Catholicism and imposed that view on the church regardless of dissenters – Francis preferred to work away patiently at building consensus and accommodating a variety of perspectives. To that end, he breathed new life into the system of regular gatherings – or synods – of bishops in Rome to debate pressing matters. Under John Paul II and Benedict, these meetings went through the motions, having little influence on subsequent papal teaching.Francis, by contrast, was at pains to listen and act, going so far in 2023 as to call a curiously named synod on synodality in his anxiety to make the process work better as a conduit between the centre and the outposts of his global church. It was part of turning the usual church structures upside down – he, the outsider in Vatican terms, promoting other outsiders to high office.Yet the expectations created by summoning these gatherings – that the views of ordinary Catholics might be heard – proved unrealistic. Attendees were more diverse, and even included small numbers of women, who were given a vote. But whenin November 2024the synod on synodality produced its final document recommending better training for priests, more lay involvement in selecting bishops and greater transparency, the Catholic theologian and former president of Ireland, Mary McAleese, spoke for many when she condemned the text as “one big wordy yawn signifying absolutely nothing. Not one single thing has shifted even marginally.”What Francis increasingly faced was disruption, disrespect and latterly demonisation by a well-organised, well-funded block of conservatively minded Catholics, mostly from Europe and the US, led by erstwhile insider figures such as the American cardinal Raymond Burke, who fiercely resisted even the suggestion that any reform was needed. In his handling of Burke – who shared with a significant number of American bishops a desire to see the church take sides in the “culture wars” that divide the US, up to and including banning President Joe Biden, a practising Catholic, from communion because he would not outlaw abortion – Francis showed that his appetite for rising above the fray and seeking consensus had a limit.Burke had held senior posts in the Vatican when Francis was elected. In November 2014, after Burke described the church as “a ship without a rudder”, the popedemotedhim to a minor role as patron of the Sovereign Order of Malta. When Burke continued to make trouble there, Francis once again stepped in and removed him. For his supporters, Burke was a martyr. For most Catholics, he was a relic of the past.In a further indication that papal patience could run out, Francis in 2021 used his apostolic letter Traditionis Custodes to restrict severely the use of the medieval Latin Tridentine mass. It had become a rallying point for traditionalists’ resistance to the changes agreed in the church as far back as 1965 at the landmark Second Vatican Council. As the first pope to have become a priest after the modernising council concluded, Francis was determined to be guided by its spirit, looking forward not back.View image in fullscreenPope Francis with Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI at St Peter’s Basilica during a celebration for elderly people in Vatican City, 2014.Photograph: Franco Origlia/Getty ImagesHis critics responded by claiming that he could not make rulings on liturgy or other matters because he was not even really the pope. Citing the longstanding practice that those elected to the papacy must continue in the role until God chose to call them to heaven, they argued that Benedict XVI’s resignation was illegal and that he remained the “true” pope.Benedict did little to encourage this – though, as his grip on life weakened, those around him were not so scrupulous, and on occasion spoke as if in his name. For his part Francis was scathing about attempts to make trouble out of the unusual circumstance of having two living popes. “I would like to say that I could speak about everything with Benedict and exchange opinions,” he remarked in 2023 shortly after the death of the pope emeritus. “He was always at my side, supporting, and if there was some difficulty, he told me, and we spoke. There were no problems.”Bergoglio was born in Buenos Aires. His father Mario’s parents had travelled toArgentinain 1929 from Portacomaro in Piedmont, northern Italy, wanting to escape a country swept up with the fascist leader Benito Mussolini. Mario married Regina Sivori in 1935. The following year, Jorge, the oldest of their five children, was born.The family spoke Spanish at their single-storey home, 531 Calle Membrillar, in Flores, but with his grandparents – who lived just round the corner in the Almagro neighbourhood of Buenos Aires – the young Jorge learned Italian, or the Piedmontese dialect of their upbringing. His father worked for an accounting firm and, while the family was not poor, money was always tight. At school, Jorge excelled in chemistry, though he later insisted he was never top of the class. Outside it, he liked football (following a local team, San Lorenzo), tango and girls. There was even a girlfriend,Amalia Damonte.View image in fullscreenJorge Mario Bergoglio, the future pope, back row, centre, with his family in Buenos Aires.Photograph: APAged 17, he attended mass in his local church of San José de Flores and was so moved by the sermon of a visiting priest, Enrique Pozzoli, that he sought him out in the confessional. In the course of their exchange, he recalled later, he discovered his religious vocation. His mother was not pleased, he recalled. “She experienced it as a plundering.”He fell seriously ill at 21 with pneumonia and doctors feared for his life. Three cysts were found on his right lung and part of it was removed in a brutal operation. The brush with death strengthened his determination to become a priest and he entered a Jesuit seminary soon afterwards. Mother and son were finally reconciled in December 1969 when he was ordained after 12 years’ training.By that stage, Bergoglio was 33 and had gained a philosophy degree at the Catholic University of Buenos Aires. He taught for a while – philosophy and literature – before in 1973 he was elected as the youngest-ever provincial of Jesuits in Argentina. It turned out to be a poisoned chalice.His six years in charge overlapped with the military junta that ruled the country between 1976 and 1983, during which period between 15,000 and 30,000 Argentinians “disappeared” or were killed. Like the country’s Catholic church, the Jesuits were divided in how to react to events. Both contained progressive elements opposed to the dictatorship and more conservative ones, including prominent military chaplains privy to human rights abuses.View image in fullscreenJorge Mario Bergoglio, centre, in the mid-1970s while serving as provincial of Jesuits in Argentina.Photograph: API/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesTwo radical priests under the provincial’s authority,Orlando Yorio and Francisco Jalics, lived among the poor in the Rivadavia shanty town in Buenos Aires. Francis ordered them to return to the order’s main house for their safety, but they refused. Shortly after they were arrested as part of a clampdown by the regime on those it regarded as subversive.In both the 2005 and 2013 papal elections there were whispers circulating that back in 1976 Francis had failed to help the two priests in their hour of need. His response to the charges was made clear in El Jesuita, a book-length conversation with two journalists published in 2010. As provincial, he had confrontedJorge VidelaandEmilio Massera, two of the three leaders of the military junta, and got the priests released after five months in captivity, blindfolded and handcuffed. While Yoria left the Jesuits soon afterwards, and accused his provincial of betrayal, Jalics stayed and remained on good terms with the future pope.In a 2018 interview Francis would describe – with a candour about his health unknown in previous popes – how the stresses and strains of leading the Jesuits through these testing times had caused him subsequently to see a psychoanalyst for six months. From the age of 10, he revealed he had suffered “melancholy spells”. She helped him, he said, with the anxiety he had been suffering over his involvement in the clandestine smuggling out of Argentina of those the military junta sought to arrest. In one case, he is said to have given a young Uruguayan man his own identity card to aid his escape.The argument over the true extent of his involvement in these escape lines was never settled, but when Bergoglio stood down after just one term as provincial in 1979, he had made so many enemies within his order that he was sent into internal exile as rector of the Colegio Máximo in Córdoba. His relationship with the Jesuits never recovered.One of his biographers, the journalist Paul Vallely, suggested that, in reflecting during this period of exile on his own record under the junta, Francis experienced a road to Damascus moment, and thereafter became a more radical, fearless and outspoken priest. As pope he said on more than one occasion, “the truth is that I’m a sinner” and that as provincial he had had to learn from “my errors along the way”. The pain of those memories would seem to have lasted a lifetime since, unlike John Paul II, who regularly returned to his native Poland, Francis never set foot on Argentinian soil again after his election.View image in fullscreenJorge Bergoglio newly appointed a cardinal by Pope John Paul II in 2001.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesHis return from the wilderness certainly did not come through joining forces with the radical liberation theology priests who were so prominent in Latin America at the time (though heartily disliked in John Paul II’s Vatican). In May 1992 his ministry with the marginalised caught the eye of the conservative cardinal Antonio Quarracino, who appointed Bergoglio as one of his three assistant bishops in the Buenos Aires archdiocese.There were certainly those in Rome who were suspicious of this bishop who spent his time in the poorest neighbourhoods and lived in a small, simple apartment near the main cathedral. But Quarracino, an old-style prince of the church, would not be contradicted and, in 1997, Bishop Bergoglio was named by the Vatican as his coadjutor – or eventual successor. In February of the following year, he took over the reins.The new cardinal was no theologian – his approach was more homespun – but his commitment to poor people was every bit as strong as that of the liberation theologians. He would simply say he did what the Jesus of the gospels told him to do. “InChristianity,” he once remarked in a book-length interview with his friend Abraham Skorka, an Argentinian rabbi, “the attitude we must have towards the poor is, in its essence, that of true commitment. This commitment must be person to person, in the flesh. It is not enough to mediate this through institutions … They do not excuse us from our obligation of establishing personal contact with the needy.”Francis had a clarity of thought that shaped every last aspect of his own life and ministry. It was sufficient to impress the up to a third of electors at the 2005 papal conclave who voted for him, if some reports of these secret meetings are to be believed. After the dysfunction and scandal of Benedict’s later years, when his personal butler was stealing his papers and passing them to the media, followed by the shock of his resignation, Francis’s vision of a pared-down, hands-on papacy won the cardinals round in 2013.He immediately brought order to the chaos into which the Vatican had descended in the twilight years of Benedict’s neglect. A council of cardinals was established to tackle key areas, notably the perilous state of the Vatican’s finances. All of the nine Francis appointed had, like him, substantial experience at the coalface, as heads of large dioceses. Most were also outsiders in the overheated corridors of power at the Vatican.View image in fullscreenPope John Paul II embracing Jorge Mario Bergoglio on his elevation to be a cardinal in 2001.Photograph: APProgress was made, notably on the financial front, until Francis’s Australian lieutenant, CardinalGeorge Pell, returned home in 2018 to defend himself against child sexual abuse accusations for which his eventual convictions were overturned. But there was so much ground to make up and so much corruption to strip out. In a much-reported 2014 Christmas “state-of-the-nation” address to the Vatican curia (civil service), Francis was at his steeliest, listing 15 “ailments” that he said plagued the church’s bureaucracy, including hypocrisy, the “terrorism of gossip”, which he said could “kill the reputation of our colleagues and brothers in cold blood”, inability “to weep with those who weep”, and “spiritual Alzheimer’s” that made leaders of senior staff forget the spirit of the gospel.He made good on his promise to promote more women to leading roles in the Vatican, but still they remain shut out of priesthood. “The church is female – it is not male,” he wrote in his 2025 autobiography, entitled Hope. “We clerics are males but we are not the church. The church is female because she is the bride.”A leak around the time of his 2019 synod of bishops for the pan-Amazon region suggested he might revert to the practice of the early church and admit women to the diaconate (one step down in ministry terms from the priesthood). It proved to be wishful thinking.Francis was not someone who believed changing the laws of the church would secure its future. He feared it would lead to schism. Yet, as he found out when, before thesynod on the familyhe called in 2015, he circulated to Catholic parishes around the world an invitation for grassroots believers to express their opinion on contentious matters, the church was already effectively in schism. The percentages of respondents endorsing its ban on artificial contraception, women’s ministry and same-sex marriage, for example, ranged from non-existent to at best a substantial minority.View image in fullscreenPope Francis praying with priests at the end of a limited public audience in the Vatican in September 2020 during the Covid-19 outbreak.Photograph: Filippo Monteforte/AFP/Getty ImagesFrancis left Catholic teaching – and hence many faithful Catholics – in a kind of limbo between the rules and the reality of their lives. Yet, to a large extent, they were content that it be that way, since he made plain repeatedly that he felt their pain, and his leadership otherwise was so inspiring. On the one occasion when he acted in this area of personal morality – encouraging priests to allow divorced and remarried Catholics to go to communion without first having to go through an annulment process for their previous marriage – he bizarrely did it in a footnote to his April 2016 apostolic exhortation, Amoris Laetitia (The Joy of Love), which contained his verdict on the synod on the family. You could almost have missed it. Perhaps that is what he wanted, in case it caused an outcry. Many local priests certainly continued to act as if the pope had never spoken, and turned divorcees away.If their actions revealed one of the drawbacks of Francis’s push to devolve authority away from the papacy and allow the local church to make more decisions, then on the scandal of clerical sexual abuse his efforts to control from the centre left a stain on his good name. In 2015, a former military chaplain, Juan Barros, was named as bishop of Osorno inChile. Barros had already been implicated in the cover-up of the sexual abuse of adolescent boys by a priest, Fernando Karadima. His appointment caused a storm of protest – from local priests, parishioners and parliamentarians.When Francis visited Chile in 2018, he dismissed the protesters and accused them of “calumny” in the full gaze of the world’s press. It caused the head of the Vatican’s own sex abuse commission to rebuke his boss publicly. Back in Rome, Francis responded by dispatching an envoy to look into the case. When his report came back siding with the protesters, Francis did a swift about-turn and described what he said on his visit to Chile as “the lowest moment” of his papacy. He summoned all the country’s bishops to Rome, and demanded their resignation for their poor handling of child abuse allegations. Some were reinstated but not Barros.Recognising your mistake and atoning for it is, of course, to be applauded, but after all the decades of cover-up of sexual abuse by clergy, it rang hollow for many. Francis had promised to take the matter seriously, recruiting victims of predatory priests to a Vatican commission he set up to stamp out abuse, but several resigned soon afterwards, judging that he was not prepared to make the changes needed and hand oversight of the church’s handling of such cases to a completely independent body.Francis’s vision of his role as pope was that of the servant leader, both inside the church and out, starting always with those at the very bottom and offering them practical help, while also challenging on a bigger stage the reasons why they were in such need in a wealthy world. Early in his pontificate, he told his priests to get out of their churches and on to the streets, as he himself had in Buenos Aires, rather than restrict their ministry to those who filled the pews.It was an inspiring vision of global Catholicism as a force for good in an unequal world and drew many to him, but – like so many of his predecessors – the scale of the challenge of leading a church that houses so many points of view proved too great for any one man. By force of personality, and his evident sincerity, modesty and warmth, Francis persuaded most Catholics to root for him, whatever his errors, and so did better than most of the successors of Saint Peter. As the “man from the end of the world” would have pointed out, lasting change takes longer than the tenure of a single pope.Two brothers and a sister predeceased him.

He looked frail, and struggled to speak. His brief Easter message, which was read aloud on the balcony by an aide, reiterated his call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.The next morning, Francis, 88, was dead.“I was so caught up in the moment that I didn’t think of his illness,” said Nicoletti, who returned to St Peter’s Square to pay his respects on Monday. “Then when my daughter called me this morning to say he had died, I was very surprised. To me it feels like it was a divine intervention – God wanted him to live until Easter, and then he left. It was a joyous day. I now feel sad but also moved to be here for his historic moment for the [Catholic] faith.”Francisdied on Mondaymorning. The pope’s remains will be transferred to St Peter’s Basilica on Wednesday, when the public will be able to pay tribute.As of Monday night, the date of his funeral had not been announced but papal funerals usually take place between four and six days after death. The canonisation ofthe Catholic church’s first millennial saint, Carlo Acutis, which had been scheduled for 27 April, has been suspended.Nicoletti, who also saw Franciswhen he visited Philadelphia in 2015, was among the thousands of pilgrims and tourists mourning the pope at St Peter’s Square. At around midday, the bells of the basilica rang out and the square fell almost silent.Father Jacopo Aprico was visiting Rome with a group of schoolchildren from Milan. They heard the news that the pope had died when they were on the train. “His death was expected because he had been so ill, but we were still surprised,” said Aprico. “He was only in this square yesterday. It is sad – you can never be prepared for someone’s death, regardless of how old or ill they might be.”Wilder Herrera was in Rome with his girlfriend, both from Colombia. He recalled seeing Francis, originally from Argentina, when he visited his hometown, close to Bogotá, in 2017. “We wanted to pay our respects,” said Herrera. “Francis was a great pope, someone who was very humble and close to the people.”Alice and her family were in Rome for the Easter weekend from Catania in Sicily. “It feels as if he wanted to wait for Easter Sunday to give his blessing and say goodbye,” she said. “Then he left us for heaven.”Francis, who almost died twice during his five-week hospitalisation, was discharged from Rome’s Gemelli hospital on 23 March and ordered by doctors to rest at home for at least two months. Although his official work duties were vastly scaled back, he madeseveral appearancesin recent weeks, the most daring being a visit to St Peter’s Basilica to thank the restorers finishing the restoration of the 17th century tomb of Pope Urban VIII.He alsoprivately metKing Charles and Queen Camilla during their recent state visit to Italy and on Maundy Thursday kept up the tradition of visiting inmates at Rome’s Regina Coeli prison.One of the last people to see him was the US vice-president, JD Vance, who was in the Italian capital for the Easter weekend andmet Francison Sunday morning, an encounter that was not previously scheduled.Francis hadalways pushed the limits throughout his 12-year papacy, so it was not surprising that he ventured out despite still being ill.He had embarked on more than 40 overseas trips during his time as pontiff, the longest and most arduous one being his four-country tour of Asia last September. His final overseas trip was to Corsica in December. Later that month he opened the Catholic Jubilee, a special year of forgiveness and reconciliation during which millions will travel to Rome. He maintained an intense schedule before being hospitalised in mid-February.Conclave: the Vatican’s secret process for choosing a new popeRead moreFrancis simplified rites for papal funerals last year and previously said he had already planned his tomb in the basilica Santa Maria Maggiore in the Esquilino neighbourhood in Rome, where he went to pray before and after trips overseas. Popes are usually buried with much fanfare in the grottoes beneath St Peter’s Basilica inVatican City.Amid intense mourning over the coming days and weeks, manoeuvring within theVaticanover who will succeed Francis will begin. A conclave must get under way within 20 days of the pope’s death.Mourners in St Peter’s Square are also contemplating his successor. “I hope the next pope will be a continuation of Francis’ papacy,” said Nicoletti.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisCatholicismThe papacyReligionChristianityVaticanItalynewsShareReuse this content"

What if each of us had the chance to build our very own Grand Design, letting our streets be lined with personal visions, liberated from the identikit brick boxes offered by the usual big housebuilders?A glimpse of this world exists, sort of, on the outskirts of Bicester in Oxfordshire, where the country’s biggest self-build experiment has been under way for 10 years.Graven Hillis a place where rooftops tilt, zigzag and bulge, where windows come in circles, squares and triangles, or poke out from unexpected places. There are balconies fashioned from glass, steel and rustic timber clinging to facades of stone, brick, wood and render, along with every type of fibre-cement board available. Wandering the freshly tarmacked streets feels like walking through a building supplies catalogue. Panels of fake wood are proudly fixed next to rusted cor-ten steel and bits of slate, as if residents were fed fizzy drinks and let loose in a cladding warehouse.Tabatha chose a unicorn-topped weathervane for her turret. Barnaby wanted a penguin reading a book on hisThere are low-slung bungalows and houses that want to be towers. Beachy timber chalets sit alongside neo-Georgian brick townhouses while puffed-up, porticoed piles stand next to angular metallic concoctions. There’s even a stripy blue house with a gigantic giraffe parked outside. Why choose one style when you can have them all?“It took us a long time to find an architect who didn’t laugh when we said we wanted turrets,” says Frevisse Dearsley-Hitchcock. Her and her husband Giles’s home, designed by the accommodating local practiceLAPD, is one of the most striking of the lot. It stands as a bright blue New England-style house with (fibre-cement) clapboard walls flanked by two octagonal turrets, one each for their children. They are crowned with bright teal cupolas topped with weathervanes (“Tabatha chose a unicorn; Barnaby wanted a penguin reading a book”), while the eaves are punctuated by porthole windows and cutout stars. “We’ve heard local kids say that a Disney princess lives here,” says Frevisse. “I think I disappointed them one day when I came out in my hi-vis and boots.”View image in fullscreenFit for a princess … the Dearsley-Hitchcocks’ twin-turret home.Photograph: Oliver WainwrightTheir dream princess castle has been a long time coming. The couple acquired the plot in 2018 for £260,000, drawn to the fact that sites at Graven Hill come with outline planning permission and, for this particular plot, “no limits on what we could do”. There were limits, however, on what their builders were capable of. Having lived in the US for years, the couple wanted features such as a basement, a laundry chute and pocket doors that slide back into the walls, none of which proved easy to realise.“The concrete basement was still wonky when we had to sign it off,” says Frevisse. “When the timber framer arrived, he didn’t know where to begin. We’d already spent £400,000 in the ground before we even began the house.” Seven years later, it’s still not finished, but they hope to move in by the end of the year – at a total cost of double what they planned. “Hindsight is a wonderful thing,” says Giles. You can picture Kevin McCloud’s gleefully furrowed brow.Graven Hill may sound like a Channel 4-funded reality experiment, but this radical neighbourhood is actually the brave venture of Cherwell district council. Inspired by the famous self-built suburb ofAlmere in the Netherlands, the local authority bought the 188 hectare site from the MoD in 2014 and set up a council-owned development company to manage the process.Glenn Howells Architects drew up amaster plan featuring 11 different character areas, ranging from “tree-lined boulevards” to “urban lanes”, with detailed “plot passports” prescribing building heights and material palettes. More or less freedom would be granted depending on the character area, in an attempt to avoid total anarchy – although, in reality, these different zones are indiscernible in the resulting hodgepodge. To get things going, the first plots were released to 10 “pioneer” residents at a knockdown price of £100,000 each, with the agreement that their trials and tribulations would be broadcast in a special series ofGrand Designs: The Streets.View image in fullscreenAnimal magic … Lynn Pratt’s pangolin house, left.Photograph: Oliver Wainwright“The whole thing just sounded amazing,” says Lynn Pratt, one of the pioneer residents, who moved here from a rural cottage in Northamptonshire, attracted to the idea of being part of a neighbourly community with nearby amenities and a bus stop. Her “pangolin” house, designed by local architectAdrian James, features scaly tiles that wrap around a big oast house-inspired roof. “It was billed as ‘a development like no other’,” Pratt recalls, “with all the houses to be high-spec, low-energy and forward-thinking, with no big developers allowed. They said they wanted a wide demographic, with a variety of ages and incomes, so it wasn’t just fancy dream homes. I built my whole house for about £350,000, including the land.”In Pratt and her neighbours’ eyes, the built reality has now strayed from that original vision. The 2,000 homes were intended to be a mix of self-build and “custom build”, where owners could personalise elements, but the latter have often veered towards the usual cookie-cutter housebuilder fare. There are now plenty of bog standard brick houses, with some grey cladding stuck on to give a half-hearted “custom” air.“I don’t know if it was Brexit or Covid,” says Pratt, “but suddenly things changed. I know costs have gone up, but the vision now feels very different. There’s very little self-build now – they’ve priced most people out.” She is also still waiting for the grocery shop and bus stop to arrive, while the pioneer homes remain cut off, stranded from the rest of the development across a field.I know costs have gone up but the vision now feels very different. There’s very little self-build nowAnother major bone of contention has been the affordable housing. Graven Hill is required to provide 30% such homes, but many feel they have been designed in a way that has created an “us and them” division between self-builders and renters. The housing association properties stand as incongruous rows of long brick terraces, as if airlifted here from a 1980s council estate.“It’s the weakest part of the whole development,” says John McCormack, a retired architect and fellow pioneer resident, who used to work in housing. “All of the different tenures were supposed to be integrated, but it’s ended up feeling like a series of ghettoes. Good design doesn’t have to cost more, but the design quality of the affordable housing is almost zero.”View image in fullscreenFour more Graven Hill builds.Composite: Oliver WainwrightResidents of some of the shared ownership homes have complained ofblack mould and freezing rooms, arguing that their properties don’t live up to their eco claims (Graven Hill says tests carried out met environmental performance standards). There have also been grumblings about the lack of promised amenities. Despite 600 homes now being occupied, there is still no mini-supermarket or community centre, and the planned pub looks unlikely to materialise.“We have faced significant challenges,” says Adrian Unitt, managing director of the Graven Hill Village Development Company. “You can build a shop unit, but getting someone to lease it is a different story.” He is standing in the sales suite of what is known as the “village centre”, which turns out to be an apartment block clad in the trademark busy variety of materials, with a coffee shop, wine bar and dentist on the ground floor.Across the road stands aprimary school designed by Architype architects, crowned with clunky rooftop railings that make it look like the scaffolding has been left up. A site nearby, formerly earmarked for a health centre, will now become a care home, after theGP provider pulled out, while residents are still awaiting a community centre where they can hold parties and events.What does Unitt make of the criticisms that Graven Hill has drifted from its original vision? “It’s a very difficult model to make stack up,” he says. “If I’m selling the land, with foundations and services, I’m getting about a third of the income that a usual developer would get. But I’m still delivering all the roads, the amenities, and theSection 106 affordable housing obligations.”View image in fullscreenCurious charms … Graven Hill from the air.Photograph: Eddy Gong/ Beauty and BicesterIt’s also very slow. If it stuck to the self-build route, the company has said, the development wouldn’t be completed until 2050. Compounding the issue, says Unitt, is ongoing damage caused by the fact that the neighbourhood is a permanent building site, with plot owners each building to their own schedules. The council asked for the infrastructure and amenities to be built first, but Unitt estimates the company has spent more than £2m rectifying kerbs, green space and play areas that have been damaged by construction crews, and “trashed by people parking all over the place”.Parking is one of the things, along with where to keep the bins, that it is hoped will be improved in the next phase of the masterplan, currently being reworked by consultants Lambert Smith Hampton, after anoutcry from residents over claims of increased density and lack of green space. Unitt says there will be “more rigidity” in the design code, after feedback from the council, but residents fear a slide towards business-as-usual after sites that were once allocated for self-builders are now being built by the developer, due to apparent lack of demand. Looking at the plans, there is no indication of how many self-build plots there will be in the next phase.Is custom build the future of housing?Read moreBy any standards, Graven Hill is a chaotic jumble. Homes are scattered with abandon, designed with little concern for making a coherent place, or how they meet the street, with stretches of wall, fence, hedge and tarmac pasted at will, and parking all over the place. But it has its curious charms. It is a very English vision of individual ambition. Of people’s determination to build their own little castles, despite the expense and trauma of it all. And of how some people, given freedom, will actually opt to build something quite conventional.“To be honest, I don’t know if I would recommend self-build,” says Frevisse Dearsley-Hitchcock. “Other people have had a smoother ride than us, but you’ve got to be in it for the long haul.” Still, they’ve had plenty of fun along the way. Most recently, Giles has been busy fitting LED striplights to their blue house’s gables. “We were inspired by the Empire State Building in New York,” he says. “It’s lit up with different colours every night!”Explore more on these topicsArchitectureHousingOxfordshirePlanning policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is this the end of fine dining?Anita ChaudhuriMon 21 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTShareTime was, the ultimate honour for any ambitious chef was to gain a Michelin star or two. Better still, three. But these days, the world of fine dining is in a state of flux. Far from going to any lengths to schmooze critics or diners, restaurateurs are taking them on, frompublicly berating customers who don’t spend enoughto ejecting anyonewho even threatens to leave an unfavourable review.Nowhere is this gear change more noticeable than in attitudes towards the esteemed “red book”, the Michelin Guide. Last October, Giglio, a restaurant in the Italian town of Lucca,asked for its star to be removed from the guide. It had become a burden, according to co-owner, Benedetto Rullo. Many diners were deterred by the prospect of “fussy” food and a formal atmosphere. “One should be able to go to a fine restaurant in a T-shirt, flip-flops and shorts,” Rullo said.This year in France, the chef Marc Veyrat took the unprecedented step of banning Michelin inspectors from his eponymous new restaurant in the super-chic ski resort of Megève. It must be said that Veyrat has form with Michelin. In 2019, at his previous restaurant, he was outraged to have one of his three stars removed. The reason? Inspectors accused him of using cheddar in a soufflé. Imagine! Rather than taking it on the chin, Veyrat took Michelin to court. He lost the case and Michelincalled him “a narcissistic diva”.View image in fullscreen‘Narcissistic diva’ … chef Marc Veyrat lost one of his three Michelin stars after inspectors accused him of using cheddar in a soufflé.Photograph: Loona/ABACA/PA ImagesGiven that Michelin stars are known to significantly boost a restaurateur’s takings (by 20% for a single star, 40% for two and 100% for three, said the late Joël Robuchon, who won 31 of them), why would anyone want to keep the inspectors at bay? Particularly as Michelin’s undercover reviewers pay the bill rather than expecting to eat for nothing, and Veyrat’s current eight-course tasting menu (sample dish: meadowsweet emulsion on a lobster tartlet) costs a crunchy €450 (£385) per head.Veyrat said that, although the matter was very close to his heart, he was too busy to explain his reasoning. Instead, he sent us a photo of his chalkboard message to Michelin. It opens with the line: “Shame on the gravediggers of French gastronomy.”One reason for chefs’ antipathy towards the guide is the extreme pressure to live up to the accolade. These criticisms of Michelin have been rumbling for a long time: in 2012, the chef Skye Gyngell complained that the star she won at Petersham Nurseries in London had become a curse, and “prayed” she would never be awarded another. Finally walking away from the restaurant, shesaid it had become too busyand there had been too many complaints from customers expecting a type of fine dining experience at odds with her more casual style.View image in fullscreenA more casual style … chef Skye Gyngell.Photograph: Pål Hansen/The ObserverRunning a restaurant at this level is stressful. Last year, the Belfast-based restaurateur Michael Deane was faced with a dilemma. A veteran of the city’s dining scene, he gained his first Michelin star 30 years ago and not only held on to it but also opened several other establishments. Then his head chef at the one-star Eipic left to set up his own business. “I was left on the back foot,” Deane says. “Did I want to hire an egotistical high-end chef to come in on £50,000 to do three tables at lunch, two at dinner, and have to employ six waiters? Did I want to get back into the kitchen at that level? I didn’t think so. I’m better at business than cooking. Or was it time to think about change? It was a very, very difficult decision.”In the end, he decided to renovate the space, merging it with an adjacent restaurant. “I decided to do a menu that chefs didn’t rate, and to stop using cheffy nonsense words like ‘emulsion’ and ‘textures’. I brought the prices down to what people could afford.” The result was the 90-seater MrDeanes, serving sweet and sour chicken wings, burgers and fish and chips alongside oysters and brie fritters with truffle honey.He admits he misses the glamour of having a star. “It was very, very difficult to hold on to it. Some people say it’s just a stick to beat yourself with. But I enjoyed having it and for nearly 30 years I stood over that stove and Michelin was the holy grail. It’s an international currency. If you go abroad and you tell someone you’ve got a Michelin star, they know about you and they know you’ve got a standard.”But in recent years, Michelin has struggled to stay relevant to a new generation of diners and influencers. It has introduced “green stars” to honour sustainability, and expanded its geographical and culinary reach – which might explain why El Califa de León, a three-metre-square taco restaurant in Mexico City, ended up being awarded a star.These changes have not all been successful, according to Andy Hayler, a food blogger whohas reviewed 1,000 restaurantsin London and 2,000 worldwide. Until the pandemic, Hayler had eaten at every three-star Michelin restaurant in the world, a project he funded with his day job as an IT professional.“Between 2016 and 2018, Michelin were forced to change their business model,” he says. “No one was buying print guidebooks any more, so they started taking money from tourist boards in places like America, China and Korea.” In South Korea,tourist officials were reported to have offered Michelin £1.4mto produce a guide to Seoul. “The problem is, there is a conflict of interest with that,” says Hayler. “It’s extremely unlikely that Michelin is going to take millions of dollars from a tourist board and then say: ‘Oh, sorry – all your restaurants are crap, so no stars for you.”View image in fullscreenBelfast restaurateur Michael Deane: ‘I stopped using cheffy nonsense words like emulsion and textures.’Photograph: Michael Cooper/Getty ImagesMichelin insist that the process of selecting restaurants and awarding stars has not been compromised, with separate teams responsible for sponsorships and ratings. But Hayler says that the standard of the newer three-star establishments was getting “dodgier and dodgier” and eventually, with the advent of lockdown travel restrictions, he decided to abandon his mission. “I wasn’t prepared to jump on a plane and fly to Taipei or South Korea every time Michelin landed a new contract with a tourist board.”There are also problems with the quality of Michelin’s online prose – much of which suggests artificial intelligence. One example, for a two-star Japanese establishment in Seoul, reads: “A culmination of such painstaking effort, the fare at Mitou genuinely reflects a sense of earnestness, modesty and dedication harbored by the two chefs as eternal students of culinary art. It thus comes as no surprise that customers eagerly anticipate Mitou’s new offerings every season.”Hayler takes issue with this, though. “Oh no, the writing was that bad long before AI came around,” he says. “Historically, the guides only included symbols, not text – like the Rosetta Stone but for restaurants. Then, when the first city guide, New York, appeared, they started to hire copywriters. People were hoping to read all these juicy insights from Michelin inspectors – but that isn’t what they got.”Of course, there are reasons beyond economic pressure why Michelin is struggling to retain cultural capital. When the guide was launched in 1900 by the tyre company’s founders, brothers André and Édouard Michelin, it was designed to help car owners plan their trips. Nowadays, its selling point is catering-industry expertise. Michelin’s PR hub claims that its assessments are made based on five objective criteria: quality of the ingredients used, mastery of flavour and cooking techniques, the personality of the chef in his cuisine, value for money and consistency between visits. But now we have TripAdvisor, Google reviews and endless influencers peddling their opinions, does anyone care very much about opaque points systems and meticulous industry knowledge?Elizabeth Auerbach has been writing her blogElizabeth on Foodfor 15 years. “I do believe that if you are a chef, Michelin still carries a lot of weight. For most, the day they are awarded their first Michelin star is probably still one of the most important days of their life. But for diners, I’m not so sure. I mean, for someone my age – I’m 51 – we still value the whole fine dining experience with all the bells and whistles. But many younger people don’t care about it because they can’t afford it. It’s getting increasingly expensive, too.”View image in fullscreenIkoyi restaurant, London … ‘Many younger people don’t care about fine dining because they can’t afford it.’Photograph: Karen Robinson/The ObserverShe mentions that the two-star Ikoyi, a West African-inspired restaurant in London, now charges £350 for its tasting menu, the kind of prices you only used to see at three-star restaurants. Although Auerbach is known as an expert in her field and now publishes a food guide to Amsterdam, she has never been approached to be an inspector. “I couldn’t do it, anyway. You have to eat two full meals a day, five days a week. That would be too much!”Karan Gokani, co-founder of Hoppers Sri Lankan restaurants in London and author of a bestselling cookbook, agrees that the concept of fine dining is out of step with how we live now. He fell in love with Michelin-star food when he came to the UK from India to study law. “I used to be very enamoured of these chefs who do multi-course kitchen concepts and about 15 processes in every dish. But now it’s got to the point where, as a diner, I just want a quick meal. It’s not only the cost – sometimes you just want things to be on your terms. I want wholesome food at a pace that I can dictate. Maybe I want the starters and mains to turn up at the same time. Maybe I want to order a few dishes, and then I want a few more. A restaurant should be a dialogue. A lot of the Michelin-star places have turned a meal into one long monologue.”Gokani says that one of his biggest frustrations with the guide is its inconsistency. “When you go out and give a star to a street-food vendor, it becomes very tricky. You’re not comparing like with like. Even in fine dining, it’s not consistent across territory. I used to live in Copenhagen and I know that the one-star restaurants there were often of equivalent standard to a two-star kitchen in London. The criteria are still cryptic. What gets you a star?”We asked Michelin to comment on this and other points, but got no response.Cheddargate: why is a leading French chef turning down Michelin stars?Read moreIronically, Gokani’s Hoppers has had a Michelin Bib Gourmand star since 2017. “We never chased a star, or expected one,” he says. “I’m not just saying this because we’re in it, but I do think that the best guide for the way we eat out now is one based on price.” The Bib awards started off by honouring menus under £30 but now have the more nebulous criteria of “affordable dining”.And, for all his protests about Michelin, Deane has also been awarded a Bib. However, he, too, questions the affordability of fine dining in the current economic climate. “If I had a Michelin star at the moment, would my old restaurant be packed out? I’m not so sure,” he says. “We struggled a bit towards the end. I’ve got a mortgage. I’ve got to put petrol in the car. I’ve got the VAT. Having a Michelin star is not always top of mind. And you have to get real. These days, our biggest competitor is probably not Michelin Bibs or even any other restaurant. As their Dine In menus get better and better, it’s Marks & Spencer.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

These are decisions no human should have to makeLucy ManganMon 21 Apr 2025 17.00 EDTShareIthink – TV historians, please correct me if I am wrong – the great British love affair with the behind-the-scenes hospital docuseries began withJimmy’s, which followed the staff and patients going about their business at St James’s University Hospital, Leeds. It was warm and lovely and life-affirming, with a bit about the pressures Thatcherite reforms were placing on everyone thrown in to cut the schmaltz. And that has been the template ever since. Focus on the good while acknowledging the bad, and keep the ratio as positive as you can without being accused of Pollyannaism.To my knowledge, 999: The Critical List is the first of its kind to show a doctor losing control in front of a patient. It is as revealing a sign of where the NHS is now as any waiting list statistic. It comes when Julie, a patient in terrible pain from a perianal abscess caused by her chronic bowel disease, is told by registrar surgeon Oladele Situ that she has to wait yet another day for surgery as she has been displaced again by people in even direr need. Resources do not permit anything like enough operations, even in awful circumstances, to be done per day. “When do we get to the point that I’m prioritised?” she cries in distress. “We understand,” says Oladele. “We apologise.” It is heartfelt. The stress already audible in his voice evolves into desperation as he assures her, “We have been on our feet all day. We are stretched to the thinness. But never think that you are not important to us … You are the reason we come to work every day.” By the end his voice is cracking. He seems to be on the verge of tears.999: The Critical List shows you why. It concentrates on the emergency list at the Royal Blackburn Hospital, an ever-evolving document comprising the sickest people in the hospital plus any A&E admissions who need immediate, lifesaving surgery in Theatre Six. The list is a work of science plus art, as purely clinical need is tempered by other factors such as age, the length of surgery and any other of the myriad special considerations that dealing with human beings in their most vulnerable states can throw up.View image in fullscreen‘Stretched to the thinness’ … 999: The Critical List.Photograph: Channel 4The stories of the patients filmed by the crew – from the parents of a child with Rett syndrome who are on the verge of collapsing with grief as she is taken to theatre, to returning patient Tanzeen, whose drug addiction has led to needles broken off in his neck but who is also in abdominal agony and losing drastic amounts of weight, to 61-year-old Vanessa who would rather die than face months in ICU after a major operation – are given their time and their dignity. But the focus is really on the doctors, nurses and other staff who are juggling resources and trying, ultimately, to do the impossible – treat everyone in good time and expose them to minimal risk in a vastly understaffed and materially deprived environment.“It’s an unmanageable workload,” consultant surgeon Nick Heywood says, the energy for equivocation clearly long past. “It feels like you’re trying to fix a broken system while working.” “We are sinking,” says list coordinator Nikki Tingle. “The NHS is. I don’t know how we are going to climb out.” When she started work in 1997 the list used to take half a day to clear. Now patients are routinely waiting until the next day or the day after that. The situation is aggravated, she says, by the increase in the number of patients with mental health issues – especially those who have not been able “to get back into the run of the world … of looking after themselves” since the pandemic.It is rare that doctors are shown swearing in frustration, even in documentaries more tightly focused on the problems in the NHS than this one. But there are many such moments here, as the number of equally critically ill patients demands the kind of decision-making no human should have to make as part of a standard working day. Operations are halted because there are no beds on wards to which they can move recovery patients, other doctors are begged from other hospitals, snatches of time from other theatres are borrowed, and the goodwill and last vestiges of energy are sapped from people hours past the ends of their shifts. Stretched to the thinness indeed.999: The Critical List is on Channel 4 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDocumentaryFactual TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

For the low, low price of $62.99, preparedness-minded customers could snatch up what one food influencercalleda “Costco apocalypse dinner kit”.Think of the kit as a KFC-style bucket, but instead of fried chicken, it is stuffed with an emergency supply of 132 meals – including pouches of dehydrated macaroni and cheese, apple cinnamon cereal and chicken pot pie – promised to last up to 25 years in storage, or until the big one hits.There were lackluster reviews – “I’d sooner allow myself to be eaten by zombies than have to survive on this,”wroteEmily Heil, a Washington Post food reporter. Spectators on social media noted that the bucket, which contained meals even the worst home chef could whip up, might be great for a college dorm room. Some people said they ate the dinners while camping.‘All of his guns will do nothing for him’: lefty preppers are taking a different approach to doomsdayRead moreA representative for Costco declined to say how many apocalypse buckets it has sold in the past year. Representatives for ReadyWise, the company that makes the bucket in various sizes as well as other “survival foods”, did not respond to a request for comment.It doesn’t take much imagination to see why Costco might be a paradise forpreppers, or people who stockpile supplies and learn survival skills in advance of emergencies such as natural disasters or societal collapse. The chain sells everything from dry goods to tools to baby formula, necessities both for someone who likes to keep a well-stocked house in the best of times and anyone scared enough to anticipate the end of times.“Preppers like efficiency, and Costco is nothing if not efficient,” said Coby Coonradt, a 44-year-old from Vernal, Utah, who co-hosts the Casual Preppers Podcast with his friend Cameron Hardy. “You can stock up on your 72-hour kit and your next family BBQ in the same trip.” Beyond food and water, Coonradt turns to Costco for freeze-dried meals, first aid kits, fire extinguishers and off-grid lighting. “You can build out a pretty legit emergency kit just by shopping there once a month.”Costco’s lore runs deep; self-described “Costcodians”, or super fans, revere the members-only chain, which is based in the US and is thethird-largest retailerin the world, after Amazon and Walmart. The store’s harsh fluorescent lighting and industrial shelving may not count for much aesthetically, but with an abundance of cheaper choices, who cares? More than 130 million peoplecallCostco their grocery store worldwide, and while not all of them identify as preppers, the chain’s tendency toward bulk – its house brand Kirkland sells everything from hot dogs to golf balls to vodka in impressively large containers – lends itself well to the ideology.View image in fullscreenPeople shop for supplies at a Costco in Burbank, California.Photograph: Damian Dovarganes/AP“Prepping doesn’t have to be extreme,” Coonradt said. “You can be totally normal, live in the suburbs, shop at Costco, and still be ready for a flood or power outage.” His co-host, Hardy, who is 43, described how apocalypse-minded shoppers can build up a doomsday supply in the same way that Ernest Hemingway describes how a character went broke in The Sun Also Rises: “gradually, and then suddenly”.“Since most people shop for groceries weekly, a simple way to start preparing is to buy a little extra food and water each time,” Hardy said. “This builds up an emergency supply large enough to keep you and your family safe during most crises.” If not the rapture, then a minor snowstorm, a sustained power outage,economic turmoil, a climate catastrophe or another pandemic.Christine, a 43-year-old from Idaho who posts prepper content to her 655,000 followers on her YouTube account, Frugal Fit Mom, owns one of the Costco buckets, which she uses mostly for camping meals. She thinks preppers get more out of buying staples in bulk. “It’s important to only get things you already use [when building an emergency kit],” she said. “If you get canned tuna because you saw someone else get it, but you hate canned tuna, sure, it will keep you alive, but you’re not going to be happy with life.”Both Christine’s Costco reliance and prepper mentality comes from “growing up really, really poor”, she said. Her parents bought in bulk because it was cheaper. But their thriftiness allowed for creativity: they made bread from scratch and built backyard gardens for their kids to play in. Now Christine passes these lessons on to her children. “You’re not gonna find it cheaper anywhere other than Costco,” she said.Every time I walk into Costco, I’m not just shopping – I’m investing in my family’s securityBarbaraAs a brand, Costco subtly leans into its reputation as a prepper paradise. It sells a variety of non-perishable foods, packs of “self-heating emergency meals” (just add a “non-flammable liquid”) and portable water purification kits. It also does aroaring tradein gold bars and coins, according to Money.com.But if prepperism isassociated with the right, the company’s politics don’t necessarily align. Costco madeheadlinesearlier this year by upholding its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives amid the Trump administration’s crackdown, and Costco’s director, Hamilton E James,has donatedto Democratic Pacs and parties.For some, the Costco prepper bucket symbolizes how distressingly within reach the end of the world seems. For others, it’s just another item to throw in the bunker. Either way,more than halfof US families stockpile food, according to the market research firm Packaged Facts, signaling some level of concern with the state of things.In Oklahoma, a homesteading influencer named Barbara – she goes by A Homestead Journey on YouTube – used Costco when stocking her “prepper pantry”. It contains all her family’s favorite food items, just en masse, so they don’t have to run out to the store when disaster strikes.“Costco is like a Disneyland for preppers,” said Barbara, who is 39 and also did not share her last name due to privacy concerns. “Every time I walk into Costco, I’m not just shopping – I’m investing in my family’s security.”Explore more on these topicsRetail industryThe Armageddon complexSupermarketsClimate crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The way we perceivebeautyin the muscular form is influenced by many factors, not least of which is gender, and it goes far beyond aesthetics. “Too muscular” can call into question one’s identity as a woman: are you a real woman if your muscles are bigger than the societal norm? “Too muscular” can also be accusatory: are you a cheat, guilty of using steroids or other performance-enhancing drugs?The ninetysomethings who revolutionized how we think about strength trainingRead moreAt a 2017talkwith students at Harvard, the ballet superstar Misty Copeland spoke about close-minded ideals of beauty. “Why am I being told my body is too muscular?” she said. “It’s code language for your skin is wrong.” The tennis great Serena Williams, in a 2016interviewwith the Guardian, said that she has been described as “too muscly and too masculine, and then a week later too racy and too sexy”. In white-dominated spaces like ballet and tennis, “too muscular” can be code-speak for “too Black”, for bodies that don’t belong – often jumbling up issues of femininity, race and power.“Too muscular” is also used to disparage transgender women and intersex athletes with naturally high levels of testosterone. The growing controversy over the participation of transgender women in athletic competition is rooted in muscle, and the perceived unfairness of muscles that come with puberty.View image in fullscreenSandra Alcorn from Australia is seen setting a new world record with 155kg deadlift at the 2024 Asia Pacific Powerlifting Championship.Photograph: SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty ImagesThis, of course, disrupts the long-standing division of sports participation based on sex. The recent establishment of non-binary divisions for major marathons including the Boston Marathon and the New York City Marathon is one way that organizers of athletic competitions are addressing the issue. There will undoubtedly be more rethinking to come.All kinds of wacky theories around hormones have been used to delegitimize women in power, connecting the body to the body politic: menopause has been called out as something that makes women unstable leaders (see: Clinton, Hillary), and yet testosterone is the hormone that actually makes people reckless (see: Clinton, Bill).All this is to say that pseudoscience has long governed norms around women’s anatomy and biology – and, by extension, their strength and power in society. Maybe our viewing habits around muscular beauty have become a bit rigid. If we go back to the muscle itself, could that loosen up – and maybe even stretch – our thinking?Amber Fitzsimmons is a modern-day anatomist – aprofessorof anatomy and chair of the department of physical therapy and rehabilitation science at the University of San Francisco, California (UCSF)who instructs students at one of the top medical schools in the country. She is also a physical therapist who has seen all kinds of real bodies enter the clinic. During my visit to her anatomy lab to observe a dissection, I asked what “too muscular” means to her, and she reminded me that Americans have been socialized to not want to see the female weightlifter body, the bulked-up form that became especially taboo in the 1970s and 80s.“‘Too muscular’ means ‘too masculine’,” Fitzsimmons said matter-of-factly. “You don’t want to be seen as a man. And that fear still persists around women and exercise.”Before our dissection, she’d gathered an audience of anatomist colleagues – Dana Rohde, Barbie Klein and Maddie Norris, all instructors and researchers at UCSF – on my behalf, to help unpack the vocabulary of muscle and where the gendering of those ideals comes from.We allow a greater spectrum of muscular beauty for menSwimmers’ shoulders. Runners’ legs. Gymnasts’ abs. Dancers’ posture. These phrases summon up different body types, all admired in one circle or another. They raise the question of what is behind the appeal of specific muscles and the characteristics they connote. Look at the way “muscle” insinuates itself into the lexicon. Synonyms for muscle include potency and domination. When you force someone to agree with you, you’re strong-arming them. To make a muscle, you contract your biceps – or more accurately, the biceps brachii. There is no more stereotypical symbol of strength than the bent-arm curl – in fact, it’s the stand-in for all muscle (see: emoji).And yet, despite its visible prominence, Fitzsimmons explained, the biceps is the strongest arm muscle only when the arm is in this “Popeye” position – otherwise, it’s the brachialis, a deeper, “pure flexor” muscle in the upper arm, which generates the most force, relegating the biceps to a supporting role.View image in fullscreenA female bodybuilder has her hair blow-dried at the 'Evolution F: A Surreal Spectacle of Female Muscle' performance in New York City in 1995.Photograph: Barbara Alper/Getty ImagesWhat does a person who studies and teaches anatomy think when they see muscles on display? The room started buzzing with debate.“Well, if you look at bodybuilders,” Rohde said, “sometimes their muscles are all for show – all that bulk makes it difficult for them to walk, and their lats are too big for a natural arm swing.”Contrast this with gymnasts, Klein pointed out: “They can lift their whole bodies with their hands, with such control – for me, what makes a muscle beautiful always goes back to function.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionForm and function: I thought about Marvel superheroes. Are their muscles functional? When my brother and I were kids, our father gave us comic books – X-Men, Wolverine, Dark Phoenix – to motivate us to draw human anatomy. We were instructed to study superhero physiques and practice sketching. What I absorbed from those comic books – other than the multiverse of stories, which I loved – was that male superheroes were top-heavy with biceps and that female superheroes were top-heavy with boobs. And that drawing that fictive landscape of muscles was a lesson in the American cultural psyche, with impossible ideals.I wondered aloud: “What if you were a Hollywood trainer for a superhero movie? What specific muscles would you target to give the appearance of strength, on the ideal body, to an American audience?”“Let’s start with a quintessential male superhero: Captain America,” Fitzsimmons said. “Certainly, the arms – triceps, biceps. Then deltoids, pectorals and latissimus dorsi, to create the exaggerated triangle from wide shoulders to a narrow waist. They overbuild the upper trapezius – that’s around the neck – for a wide shoulder, then define the thorax with the external obliques” – the most superficial of the lateral abdominal muscles. And, finally, the rectus abdominis – the six-pack.“It’s funny that if we see someone with a six-pack, we automatically think they’re strong and really fit,” Klein added thoughtfully. “But they might just be naturally leaner.”Our discomfort with muscles begins when we move too far into that same territory for a woman. “The female equivalent is not equivalent at all,” Ftizsimmons said. “Female superheroes are strong, but they’ll have boobs and a bottom. Smaller shoulders – not too wide. You’ll have a flat stomach, but you won’t see a supercut six-pack. Enhanced hips and glutes, tapering to a narrow waist – a controlled hourglass. You can’t be too extra. If you see the thick neck, thighs and wide shoulders that we expect on a man, it throws people off – and that’s because we’ve been conditioned that way.”In other words, we allow a greater spectrum of muscular beauty for men – from the lean, wiry marathon body to the big, beefcake muscles of the heavyweight wrestling body. Even among female athletes themselves, there is a self-perceived conflict between their “performance body” in the sports context and their “appearance body” in the social world – across multiple studies of NCAA athletes in different sports, women have expressed pride in the utility of their muscularity on the playing field, but also worry that those same muscles would make wearing jeans or dresses look “abnormal”; they compensate by holding back in the weight room to avoid getting “too big” and by wearing makeup to emphasize their femininity.When it comes to the superhero body, it’s all about signaling fitness and outward muscular appeal rather than actual function, no matter what the gender. Theirs are the muscles that we – the audience – are indoctrinated to receive. We absorb that information into our daily lives and respond in kind. “All you need to do is go to a gym and see what’s happening there,” Fitzsimmons said. “It trickles down.”This kind of thinking, it turns out, isn’t just Marvel comics, Hollywood superficiality, and gym culture talking – it’s embedded in our medical textbooks too. In these ways, muscle iconography in modern society can be harmful to men, too.Lift, rest, recover: how to start weightliftingRead moreThe social psychologist Jaclyn A Siegel has studied how the stereotypical male body ideal contributes to eating and muscle dysmorphic disorders. In the attempt to become muscular,she has said, men are vulnerable to “the masculine norms of dominance, confidence, sexual success, and physical and emotional self-control”, which make them susceptible to eating disorders. In fact, the quiet increase of boys and men seeking help for disordered eating, excessive exercise and performance-enhancing substance abuse reveals how surface ideals of muscularity can hurt us all.Thankfully, little shifts are happening all the time. Norms vary by culture and geography, and they aren’t static. Medical textbooks are beginning to feature more varied bodies; influential athletes are becoming more visible and vocal about body image and mental health; and women of all ages are lifting heavy at the gym – often because doctors have begun prescribing them that regular dose of iron.Maybe you’ve heard of “Granny Guns”, AKA Marlene Flowers, the 68-year-old social media sensation who started lifting weights a decade ago and is now followed by millions. Her witty, satirical videos challenge stereotypes around ageing women and strength, and encourage others to follow her example.

It’s a massive book about cycling and riding up imposing mountains that look gorgeous in black‑and‑white photographs even as they bring down almost unbearable pain on those cyclists brave and crazy enough to confront them.Yee, the Olympic triathlon champion, is steeling himself for a new start as a novice long‑distance runner who will enter similarly dark terrain in theLondon Marathonon Sunday.“The nerves are definitely there but I’m excited too,” Yee says in his thoughtful yet exuberant way.“Honestly, it’s excitement about the unknown. As elite athletes we’re used to hurting ourselves and going through that pain. I’ve been in some dark places before and, in a weird way, I’m probably quite looking forward to experiencing this different kind of pain. I’m excited, rather than daunted.”‘I’d love to run 2hr 7min’: Olympic triathlon champion Alex Yee enters London MarathonRead moreYee is used to swimming 1.5km, riding his bike for 40km and then running the final 10km of a triathlon. There are enough photographs of his cherubic face etched in agony to believe his familiarity with suffering – so he thinks hard before selecting a definitive dark place from the past.“Probably the primary one is the Olympics last year as it was the feeling of everything you’d worked towards slowly slipping away. At the same time you’re trying to keep your mind in the right place to focus on digging yourself out of that big hole.”The Paris Olympic triathlon was almost done, and nearly as gone as his legs, as Yee faced the 14.5sec chasm that had opened between him and Hayden Wilde, his great rival and friend from New Zealand. We will soon return to that searing comeback that sealedYee’s Olympic victorybut, first, the vast challenge of his debut marathon dwarfs everything else.Are the psychological demons of the marathon even harder to control than the gruelling physiological demands? “They definitely can be. But I’ve always tried to experience lots of the emotions and difficulties which could be thrown at me during race day as much in training. When I’m prepared for something, I feel mentally at peace and able to get the most out of my body. There are going to be things which I won’t have experienced before in this marathon and, psychologically, that’s tough. But it’s also going to be a really great learning curve for me and hopefully I’ll come out the other side saying: ‘Wow, I’ve experienced this and what does it mean for triathlon, potentially another marathon, whatever it may be?’”There will be so much attention on Yee, and expectation, that his rigorous preparation might be knocked off-kilter. “It’s definitely something I’ve thought about and the honest answer right now is I don’t know. I’m doing everything I can to mitigate those emotions, to try and control things. I went down to London a few weeks ago and stood on the start line. I tried to feel the emotions which I might experience and I honestly couldn’t, because it’s impossible to comprehend until the race starts.“It means a lot more to me that it’s in London and that’s going to be another unknown. I’ve always framed the crowd as giving you that extra push when you need it most. Hopefully I’m going to use that energy come 20 miles when they say the real race begins.”How much of the course did he complete? “I ran about 30km and got to see a lot of it, particularly the Isle of Dogs which I wasn’t too familiar with. Having run in London I’ve seen a lot of the other places. I’ve run the mini-marathons but, yes, that Canary Wharf area was a bit unknown. So it was great to familiarise myself so there are no surprises.”View image in fullscreenYee celebrates with his gold medal in Paris.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe marathon, at 42km, is more than four times the distance Yee runs in the triathlon and he concedes that the famous old distance has played on his mind. “It was a distance I probably feared in my first few sessions. You’re doing 20km of marathon and thinking: ‘This is going to be quite tough.’ But I’ve started to embrace the excitement of being part of a magical race and running this magical distance. People always seem to come out the other side a better person or having learned something about themselves.”Yee admits that the marathon has, at least temporarily, taken over his life. “There are not many times where I’m not thinking about it. But that purpose is something  I crave because to have that so quickly after an Olympics has been a godsend. I struggled coming off 2021 [when he won triathlon silver at the Tokyo Games] but I’ve been able to sink my teeth into this and dream of that start line and finish line.”What is the longest distance he has run? “Two weeks ago I ran 38km – so just 4km to go. I did 30km at my projected race pace to get an idea what it would be like. It was honest running and it made me realise how hard it is to prepare for a marathon.”Honest as in painful? With a laugh, Yee says: “Yes! I had some tough conditions as it was really windy. But I did it by myself and that’s important because there are going to be some lonely moments in a marathon. To experience those moments by yourself allows you to dial into your mental process and stay present.”How would it have felt to run another 4km at a fast pace? “I felt under control but there’s an element of the unknown and that’s one of the big reasons why I’m doing this race – to feel that excitement. It’s a massive stab in the dark for me to even have the audacity to try this. Win, lose or draw, I think there’ll be personal growth, hopefully physical growth too.”Yee has a whole team behind him for London, including a key role for one of his long-term sponsors. “Keep an eye on what I’m wearing on my feet in the marathon as I’ve been working very closely with New Balance on a new shoe. I’ve been involved a little with the development, and testing, and it makes me feel like I’m in the best shoe for the marathon.“I’m coming up to my 10th year with New Balance and that’s really special. They were one of my first ever sponsors and to have that authentic relationship, and for them to put their belief in me at such an early stage, made me realise this was something I could do properly and give a real good go.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is a massive inspiration and I’ve always admired his philosophical approach.”Kipchoge spoke this year of his interest in Yee and evenoffered to mentor him. “We haven’t spent any time together yet as he is very serious with his preparations,” Yee says of Kipchoge. “But there’s potential after the marathon and I’d love to pick his brains, to learn from him. I regard him as the greatest of all time in marathon running and so it’s a bit bizarre to share a start line with him. It’s the biggest honour I could have.“Eliud’s approach has allowed him to master his mind. So many people work hard physiologically to get into the best possible shape – but they neglect the power of the mind. I try to bring that mental approach to the triathlon so I can stay calm and, in those testing situations, be present. I can flow through things and that’s allowed me to make some very critical decisions at very important times – like in the Olympics.”Yee relives the greatest achievement of his career so far: when he came back from a desperate situation in Paris last summer to win gold. “With 3km to go I was about 15 seconds behind,” he says, his eyes widening as if, even now, he can’t believe the perilous situation. “To be able to stay present, and focused, and believe I could do it, was so important.“With about a mile to go my coach Adam Elliott shouted for me to give it one more try. That really resonated as, before the race, he said I needed to pick a point and just go for it. So I picked a point as we’d come off Pont des Invalides and, initially, nothing happened. And then, over the next 100 metres, it felt like I’d gone from this insurmountable gap to being on [Wilde’s] shoulder and taking the lead. It was a really special moment I’ll never forget.”View image in fullscreen‘The primary goal is to enjoy it, to cross that finish line with a smile on my face. It will definitely hurt along the way.’Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianWilde was notably gracious in defeat, but helooked less impressed a few weeks laterwhen Yee again beat him in Boston and, as he crossed the finish line, replicated the “cold celebration” of Kylian Mbappé and Cole Palmer. “Initially there was a little unhappiness about it,” Yee says of Wilde’s reaction, “but straightaway we had a conversation. It’s important to leave things on the field and come out as better mates. Hayden races with so much personality and panache and that’s something I admire about him and I’d like to do the same. Sharing our emotions and our passion is important for the sport.”Ruth Chepngetich and Peres Jepchirchir withdraw from London MarathonRead moreYee is also passionate about his mixed ethnicity, which fuses a Chinese heritage on his father’s side with his mother’s English background, and the fact that he grew up in multicultural Lewisham in south-east London. “I was speaking to my parents about my Chinese influence and how that affected me. For the first 15 years after they came to the UK, my grandfather and father tried to fit in and be as western as possible. But as I got older and social norms changed they started to embrace their ethnicity, their background. I definitely noticed the influence of Chinese culture on myself, especially as the first-born and the responsibility bestowed on me.“And then being part of such a diverse culture within Lewisham, and to go to school with so many different people, meant I never saw colour as a thing. People were just people and that’s an important message.”His grandfatherAlbert is still doing Parkruns at 93and he will be there to support Alex on Sunday. Yee says “he’s a massive inspiration. I’d love to still be running at that age. He’s got such zest for life and it shows the power of running.”Yee pauses when I ask him what time, amid the inevitable pain, he might run in his first marathon. “The primary goal is to enjoy it, to cross that finish line with a smile on my face. It will definitely hurt along the way but I would love to go under two hours 10 minutes. If I have a really good day, then let’s see what else could happen.”Explore more on these topicsLondon MarathonAthleticsMarathoninterviewsShareReuse this content"

I went along too, just so I could go for a drink with them afterwards to say goodbye. While I was waiting I got talking to the receptionist. I told her what had happened and she said: “Why don’t you go in and meet the director? It can’t hurt.”So I had a chat and a laugh with Alan Clarke and he told me about the part of Carlin – he said it was written for a Scottish guy, which I’m obviously a million miles from. But I’d been boxing since I was 11 and had this walk which made an impression on him as he saw me out. I found out later the walk was the only reason I got the part.Alan, and Roy Minton, who wrote Scum, were tough old boys but talked about films and literature and wanted to pass on what they’d learned to kids like us. The performances came mostly from Clarkey’s direction – he could whisper in your ear before a scene and upset you in a second if that’s the emotion he was after. We’d have gone to the ends of the earth for him.View image in fullscreenWho’s the daddy now? … Ray Winstone as Carlin.Photograph: Ronald GrantWhat I brought to that role was what I’d experienced by the age of 19. For example, the scene where Carlin takes out the B-wing daddy was supposed to last longer, but having seen someone being hit with an iron bar I knew the shocking thing about real life violence is it’s over quick and it hurts. Every slap we got from one of the screws was real. It was the same with the swearing and the racist language – if that hadn’t been in there, you’d have lost the reality of it.After the BBC version of Scum was banned, I kind of retired from acting, but when I got a call saying it was going to be made again for cinemas, the deal was for two films – the producers also wanted me for That Summer!, which was going to be filmed in Torquay. I was only offered £1,800 for that, but I thought: “Eight weeks by the sea; wine, women and song.” So I did it for a holiday, really.A few characters had to be re-cast when we made the second Scum, which brought a freshness to it. For example, David Threlfall and Micky Ford played Archer in a totally different way, but both were blinding. As for the rest of us, Clarkey said: “Don’t do anything different, don’t try and do it better, because it’s already there.” He wanted to keep the performances off the cuff, because that felt more raw and real.There were a few other changes, though. In the BBC version Carlin takes on another boy as his “missus”, but I said to Alan: “He’s not a lifer, that wouldn’t happen.” He thought I was uncomfortable with it – maybe I was, to be fair – and that part was cut. In hindsight, I think that was wrong.Over the years people have shouted: “Who’s the daddy now?” or “Where’s your tool?” at me. I just give them a wave and a smile. Once a big fella started staring at me on the tube like he was going to start something. I thought: “Here we go …” Eventually he said: “Were you in Scum? Fucking good film.”Phil Daniels, played RichardsI heard that part of the reason the first Scum was banned is that the then head of the BBC was an ex-magistrate who had visited borstals. There are lots of shocking incidents in the film – beatings, rape and suicide – which he said wouldn’t all have happened in so short a time.Obviously misbehaviour was part and parcel of making the film. We had a special bus laid on to take us to the location, an old psychiatric hospital. One day, the driver got off the bus but left the keys in the ignition and Raymondo stole it. We drove round picking up patients and taking them for a ride.View image in fullscreenTough time … Phil Daniels and John Judd.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyWhen Carlin hits my character, Stripey Richards, with a sock full ofsnooker balls, the fact the scene’s done in one continuous take helps sell it. You see Ray pick up the balls from the snooker table and put them in the sock and the camera follows him right up to the point where he clocks me. There’s a moment where his hands are out of shot, and someone surreptitiously swapped that sock for another full of ping pong balls covered in papier-mache. I still ended up with a mark on my face, though. When Ray put the boot in a couple of times afterwards I learned to lift my bum in the air so I got kicked in the arse rather than the balls.The sock was full of ping pong balls. I still ended up with a mark on my face thoughA load of extra boys were brought in from a youth club to make up the numbers for the “murderball” scene in the gym, which ends in a Black v white fight.

Alan and the cameramen stayed up on a rostrum out of the way and just let us get on with it. The tables got spontaneously piled up and because we’d been eating baked beans and mashed potato, that’s what ended up all over the floor, which became like an ice rink. It looks fantastic, but it was pretty hairy – we were all slipping around and just trying to stay on our feet.Scum is on UK and Irish digital platforms nowExplore more on these topicsFilmHow we madeRay WinstoneUK criminal justiceBBCDrama filmsDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

He points to a tattoo on his heavily inked torso that sums it up. “It says ‘You need me’,” he explains in a tobacco-stained California burr. “When I did this tattoo, I was such a piece-of-shit drug addict who only cared about himself. I thought it was funny. I don’t need you guys – you need me.” It inspired You N33d Me, one of the best tracks on the sax-blasting post-punk band’s electrifying, sort-of-self-titled fourth album Viagr Aboys. Hooked on amphetamines, pills and Valium at various points in his past, Murphy has been, by his own admission, the last person anybody needed around.But the strongest thing Murphy is consuming when we meet on a recent Thursday afternoon is black coffee. We’re in the lair of Shrimptech Enterprises, the independent label and umbrella company for the Swedish band’s increasingly hectic operations: they’ve gradually climbed out of the toilet circuit over the last decade, and business is booming. This is where Viagra Boys write and record, design merch and poster art, all six members punching in for regular hours most weekdays. Our chat is soundtracked by the insistent chime of a piano being tuned. Here, Murphy is a cog in an increasingly smooth-running machine.Born in the small city of San Rafael, California, to an American father and a Swedish mother, Murphy’s upbringing was strict. “They were very obsessed with healthy foods,” he says. “I never drank soda, didn’t watch TV, all that stuff was kind of banned.” Would it be fair to say the rest of his life has been a reaction against that? “It really has.”A bored, unruly skater kid in his teens, Murphy began drinking and stealing from his parents to buy whatever drugs he could get his hands on. He was arrested for the first time aged 15 and was in rehab for drug addiction by 17. In an initially successful bid to get sober, Murphy then moved to Stockholm to live with his aunt and ended up staying. He dropped out of high school and became a tattooist, but sobriety didn’t last, especially after rock’n’roll, he says, “swept me off my feet”.The other Viagra Boys, Stockholm punk scene veterans, recruited Murphy after seeing him sing a Mariah Carey song drunk at karaoke. He had never been in a proper band and felt out of his depth, but he pressed on with the attitude of: “OK, rock’n’roll, let’s go. Let’s do this until we’re dead. I maybe thought that would come sooner than later.”Viagra Boys’ 2018 debut singleSportswas an addictively funny satire of hypermasculinity (their name drew from similar inspiration); their debut album Street Worms, released that year, railed against Sweden’s growing rightwing populism with wit and muscle. But the band’s steady rise has been built chiefly on relentless, riotous touring. Murphy, shirtless and tracksuit-trousered, stokes the crowd into rising levels of derangement – at their2023 Glastonbury set, someone in the crowd was tossing their toddler into the air – as saxophone player Oskar Carls writhes around the stage in outrageously short shorts.View image in fullscreenOutrageous … Sebastian Murphy performing with Viagra Boys at Coachella festival earlier this month.Photograph: Arturo Holmes/Getty Images for CoachellaIn an uptight world, a group dedicated to getting loose like this – so loose Murphy has the word tattooed on his forehead in Swedish – has major appeal: last year Viagra Boys played US arenas supporting Queens of the Stone Age. Their biggestworld touryet began this month at Coachella and will end 60 dates later at London’s Alexandra Palace. Murphy surmises that a lot of the fans “are just freaks, you know. Freaks recognise freaks. It’s freeing for a lot of people to see some dude that has clearly no muscles and is just letting his gut hang out have a good time.”There was a time when Murphy wouldn’t get on stage without taking amphetamines first. But as his bandmates started having kids and settling down, the pace had to slow to remain sustainable. Murphy credits bassist and de facto bandleader Henrik “Benke” Höckert with gradually tightening things up. “I would always be so pissed off at him if he decided to stay sober for a tour,” Murphy says. “I was busy with doing drugs and thinking about myself; he was busy planning shit. Making it work as a viable source of income. Which would not be possible if we were fucked up every day.”At the same time, the crippling hangovers and attendant anxiety started to become too much. “I still know how to party for sure,” says Murphy. “But I definitely know my limits now.” Drugs will never be entirely off the menu – “I can’t really help it when I’m on tour,” he admits – but these days he mostly sticks to beer (just the 30 or so a week). He goes to the gym and plays squash to try to stay in shape. He’s even stopped getting tattoos because he says he can’t take the pain any more. “These days if I stub my toe I’ll be crying for a week.”In 2021, the band’s founding guitarist Benjamin Vallé died aged 47, shaking them all hard. They supported each other through the loss: where some men struggle to discuss difficult emotions, Viagra Boys have no such problem. “We talk to each other about everything,” says Murphy. I ask him if a newfound respect for death prompting him to change his lifestyle. He prefers to think of it as not wasting a good thing. “I’ve got a great fiancee, I’ve got an apartment,” he says. “I can afford things. Life is really easy and really good. I don’t want to fuck it up.”‘Apparently, he had a fist fight with King Charles’: the jawdropping life of Luca Prodan, Argentina’s punk godRead moreHis visual artist fianceeMoa Romanova, who did the artwork for their third album, 2022’s Cave World, has a studio next door to Shrimptech. At one point she drops in with their dog Uno – both are subjects of songs on Viagr Aboys.Uno IIis a strange tale of conspiratorial anxiety seen through the eyes of an Italian greyhound with chronic dental problems. River King is a piano ballad in which Murphy croons with charming imperfection about Chinese takeaways and calming domesticity. It’s a disarmingly gentle end to the album: have Viagra Boys finally gone soft? Murphy smiles a gold-toothed grin. “We’ve always been soft. That’s been the problem all along.”Viagr Aboys is released via Shrimptech Enterprises on 25 AprilExplore more on these topicsPunkFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Courtesy of Thor PedersenSpending nearly a decade on the move gave me a deeper understanding of the importance of conversation, people’s boundless generosity – and my limitationsByThor PedersenMon 21 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTShareIhave often felt as if I was born 100 years too late. There was a time when satellites weren’t whizzing above us and everything had yet to be discovered or filmed. Growing up, it seemed as if all the great adventures had happened before I was born. But in 2013 I discovered that – although it had been attempted – no one had made an unbroken journey through every country without flying. I had a shot at becoming the first to do it.I was fascinated that such an adventure was still out there, untouched. However, I was in my 30s, I had just met a wonderful woman, my peers were having their first children (and in some cases their second) and I had a 12-year career in shipping and logistics. But I couldn’t let the idea go. So, at 34, I set off – and didn’t return home until almost a decade later. These are the lessons I learned along the way.View image in fullscreenSuwałki’s 19th-century railway station.Photograph: Iwona Fijol/AlamyHuman generosity can be astoundingIt was a cold, dark night in December. A train had brought me to Suwałki, which people say isthe coldest city in Poland. It was quiet. Snow was falling, but otherwise everything was still. I was carrying a piece of paper with a name, a phone number and an address for where I was supposed to be staying. But I had no sim card, so I began walking, looking for someone who could help me.Just as I was beginning to wonder if I would ever meet anyone, a woman opened her front door. I dashed over. Luckily, she spoke English and invited me in. She was happy to host me and convinced me there was no point in heading back out into the cold.I was quickly given a full plate of food and a spare bed. All this from a stranger. The next day, I was served breakfast and taken to the bus that would carry me to Lithuania.View image in fullscreenMaletsunyane Falls in Lesotho.Photograph: Maurice Brand/AlamyThere are still some hidden and spectacular natural wondersLesotho was country No 106 on my very long journey. Its natural beauty was immediately apparent. The whole state sits above 1,400 metres. It was suggested I go higher up into the mountains, to Semonkong. I wasn’t prepared for what I saw. Was I in Iceland, Austria, Bhutan or Bolivia? I went for a long walk across a spectacular green landscape. Birds chirped in the high grass; the air was extraordinarily fresh; the sun shone on my face from the dark-blue sky.The mountains of Lesotho are horse country. Every now and again, riders draped in thick blankets would pass. Then I reached Maletsunyane Falls. The nearly 200-metre waterfall was glistening in the sun at the end of a canyon. And I had it all to myself.People’s resilience is powerfulIn 2015, I travelled through western Africa. At the time, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia were dealing with the world’s largest Ebola outbreak. A taxi driver in Guinea said to me: “Here we have everything, but we have nothing.” These countries are rich in many ways – from natural resources to beautiful landscapes – yet most of the people are not.But after only an hour in Sierra Leone, I had been invited to a wedding: loads of music, lots of people in fancy clothes, an abundance of food and drink, small talk and dancing. No matter how hard life gets – and my journey left me in no doubt that it can get impossibly hard – people always find a way to laugh, play and fall in love.View image in fullscreenPedersen gets a ride with a truck driver in Central African Republic.Photograph: Courtesy of Thor PedersenIsolating yourself is a mistakeWhen you take public transport in Denmark, where I’m from, you always pick the seat farthest from everyone else. We value our privacy and respect the privacy of others. But in much of the world, the best seats are the ones next to other passengers. Where else will you find conversation?In west and central Africa, I found that everyone in a bus or a bush taxi would immediately form a unit, sharing food and stories and holding babies for one another. I was infuriated when a driver seemed ready to leave me at a corrupt checkpoint – until a woman behind me on the bus explained he had been playing a game to put pressure on the armed guards. This was a simple, lonely checkpoint on a dirt road. There was nothing else nearby, all my paperwork was in order and the soldiers knew this. If the driver had left me at the checkpoint, I would have become their problem. Where would I have slept? What would I have eaten? The soldiers didn’t need that kind of headache. On that journey, I learned a lesson: we were a team after all.What you want and what you need are not the same thingJust about anything can become routine and begin to feel like work – even travelling to every country in the world. It is rare for people to travel constantly for much more than a year because it wears the soul; most long-term travellers return home exhausted to reflect and recharge.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Buses, trains, boats, people, food, unpacking, packing, embassies, borders, bureaucracy – a long tunnel of countries. I hit a wall after about two years, but had to push through it to reach my goal. I learned the difference between what I want and what I need. I learned to live on a rock and how to engage in conversation with absolutely anyone. Once I returned home, I realised the only things that had kept their value were the relationships and conversations I had had. Everything else seemed perishable.View image in fullscreenPedersen on the coast near his home in Denmark.Photograph: Anders Rye Skjoldjensen/The GuardianYou can form connections without sharing a languageI once had a 12-hour train journey from Belarus to Moscow during which no one else spoke anything but Russian. It didn’t seem to bother them that I didn’t know the language beyondnyetorda; they sat and spoke to me in Russian for several hours, while we shared food and vodka.It really isn’t hard to forge connections with people. More often than not, I have found myself laughing with a complete stranger in spite of our lack of a common language. I have been invited into people’s homes based on gestures alone. I have negotiated prices by showing banknotes and adding or removing some until we agreed on the value. And more than once, finding myself broken and in despair, the glimpse of a child’s smile helped me to mend.Slow travel teaches you how big the world isIt is hard to grasp the distance between London and New York when you fly. But when you travel via seven ships and several buses, it helps you to understand. I have seen deserts turn lush, bushes turn to trees, trees turn to forests, flat landscapes rise into mountains, villages turn into cities and rivers become oceans. I have seen where countries meet and there is rarely a clear difference between one side and the other: people tend to wear the same clothes, eat the same food and speak a common language. In my experience, you often need to travel quite far before you notice changes. But all it takes to see the size of our world is to slow down.View image in fullscreenPedersen about to embark on a container ship from Praia, Cape Verde to Guinea Bissau.Photograph: Courtesy of Thor PedersenThe constant challenges of travelling provide an educationWe gain life experience at a much faster rate when we are challenged and under pressure, as we are when we travel abroad: what is dangerous? How do you greet people? Where do you get what you need?My years abroad led me to a deeper understanding of my limitations. I learned languages, explored new cultures, and expanded my knowledge of geography, geopolitics, humanitarian work and much more. It has been an education; nearly two years after returning home, I still have a lot on which to reflect. I was 34 when I left home and 44 when I returned. But, considering my life experience, I wonder how old I really am.The Impossible Journey: An Incredible Voyage Through Every Country in the World Without Flying by Thor Pedersen is published on 24 April (Robinson, £25).

In the olden days, these polls would be parsed for very subtle shades of meaning. A dip in support for Labour might, via some complex logic, tell us the state of the power struggle between Blair and Brown, or what the nation really thought of Ed Balls. If the Tories did well in the 00s, that was more or less how you would expect an opposition to perform; if they did badly, experts would stroke their chins and wonder how the party could improve, to become the natural repository for the nation’s disgruntlement.Austerity made a huge difference to local democracy; local authorities, facing huge funding cuts, mostly ended up with the same agenda, which was to survive, with execution of their statutory duties intact. They varied in competence, of course, and in the language they used, but you can’t stamp much of a political identity on keeping your head above water.That didn’t stop anyone trying to read between the lines for how the nation really felt. Ah, the Greens were only up by 0.8% (2017, England), that must mean English people don’t really care about climate breakdown. Whenever independents win, it’s written off as “that’s just a weird place, where independents win”. It’s understandable – why do the hard work of figuring out what’s going on, if it might only be going on in Frome? But it’s frustrating, too, because there’s a message there, if voters are looking at all established political parties and saying, “Nope, none of those, thanks”. But that’s the wrong kind of dissatisfaction, so it doesn’t register.Whenever the Lib Dems do well, the fashionable thing is to say it’s because of their ground gameOn 1 May, a lot of areas where theGreen partywould typically get a good share – Brighton, East Anglia – aren’t in the running, but that’s fine, because even if they were, psephologists would have priced that in. Nothing to see here, folks, Brighton always goes that way, it’s something to do with being close to the sea (but only that bit of the sea). Whenever the Lib Dems do well, the fashionable thing is to say it’s because of their ground game. They could do really well in Devon, Cornwall, Oxfordshire, and it will be explained by their activist army, always ready to knock on doors, or wear yellow (an awesome commitment to the cause: it suits almost nobody). Analysis rarely troubles itself with why those party members are so enthusiastic – it’s just the way they’re built.Instead, all eyes are on Reform, which has high hopes against the Tories in Greater Lincolnshire, and against Labour in the “red wall”. There is almost no result that doesn’t feed intoNigel Farage’s narrative, that he’s the plucky challenger and the only way to see him off is for all the other parties to become more like him.How to fight a fascist state – what I learned from a second world war briefing for secret agents | Zoe WilliamsRead moreIf Farage does well against Labour, there’s a good chance it will amp up its anti-immigrant stance and cosplay some casual xenophobia. If he does well against the Tories, they will probably resile from net zero – work that Kemi Badenoch has pre-emptively started. Yet if Reform does badly, it will become the dog that didn’t bark and the conversation will move on. It is constitutionally impossible for politicians and commentators to concentrate properly on dogs that make no noise.Farage will continue, undeterred, and the main parties will most likely strive to become more like him anyway.I thought I was nostalgic for a time when the local elections were boring, but that’s not exactly right: whatever the realities of local government, and things were indeed better when they weren’t so cash-strapped, there has always been a tendency to write off the progressive vote as random, or outlying, and rightwing insurgency as indicative of some fundamental truth. I feel sure that this creates a sense among voters that there’s only one kind of protest worth making at a local level, and that everyone else may as well stay at home.I’d never be able to prove that, though – all I can do is vote, and being in London, not until 2026.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLocal electionsOpinionLocal governmentReform UKLabourConservativesLocal politicsLiberal DemocratscommentShareReuse this content"

Context, motivation and, for the most part, IraqisPeter BeaumontI was there with US soldiers in 2006 and can see why the film-makers zoomed in on them so closely. But it results in glaring flawsMon 21 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Apr 2025 09.52 EDTShareThink back to 2006.Iraqwas at the peak of its conflicts. A horrific sectarian war was raging, and al-Qaida in Iraq and other insurgent groups, both Sunni and Shia, held sway in substantial areas of the country.Suicide bombers and IEDs were a daily occurrence targeting both Iraqis and foreign forces, and in cities and towns from Fallujah and Ramadi, to Baqubah and Mosul, US troops were engaged in urban warfare. It was as much about ambush and hit-and-run attacks as about formal battles.Alex Garland’s new film Warfareis a re-enactment of one of these clashes – the final days of the battle of Ramadi. Garland and his co-director, former US Navy SealRay Mendoza, who fought during the engagement, have made much of their desire for authenticity. Their film is based, they say, as accurately as possible on the memories of those involved.Its aim, they have suggested, is to provide as immersive an experience of combat as possible for audiences with no grasp of the reality of conflict.In some senses, it succeeds. Warfare is a film that captures the essence of the Iraq of almost 20 years ago, down to minute details including the furnishing of the Iraqi house where much of the action takes place.The Navy Seal team who are its focus are inserted into Ramadi after dark, occupying several houses to provide sniper support for Marines operating nearby in the city. A sense of mounting risk is brilliantly conveyed. The violence, when it occurs, is unexpected and shocking, for all that it is anticipated.While the seriesGeneration Kill, depicting the 2003 invasion, dealt with fast and mobile fighting, Warfare is defined by the claustrophobia that permeated the later war. Soldiers were trapped in vehicles threatened by the ever-present roadside bombs, trapped in outposts under mortar fire or holed up in the houses seized in hostile territory by the “small kill teams”.The consequences of the violence are portrayed unsparingly, including what it means to be around those who are badly wounded, inspiring a kind of collective shock.Garland is also clever in using the technological trappings of modern war. He shows us the battlefield sensor systems I first encountered in Iraq, ghostly renderings on which you could see the body heat of approaching insurgent fighters, piped into combat computer systems from drones and other cameras.But where Warfare is unsuccessful is when it falls into traps of its own making. If its overarching message is to emphasise a pointless exchange in a pointless war, Garland’s artistic choices left me wondering at the purpose of the film. For while Garland and Mendoza have made much of its realism, Warfare covers little new ground in its depiction of violence.Every generation of film-makers has thrown up those wanting to show a version of war “as it really is”, from Francis Ford Coppola’s shocking visual metaphor of sacrifice at the conclusion of Apocalypse Now, to Steven Spielberg’sbloody landing scene in Saving Private Ryanand Sam Peckinpah’s stylised mayhem inCross of Iron. All of those, however, were far more conventional films that sought to engage viewers with relatable characters and storylines.The problem with documenting or representing war, as it is experienced at the most visceral level by those who fight in it, is that it is essentially a fool’s errand. Proximity to violence, contrary to the famous dictum ofRobert Capa, that most celebrated of war photographers, does not necessarily add value or clarity of meaning. Instead, like zooming in on a digital picture, it has the tendency to break into individual pixels. Meaning falls apart. Though this film is determined to plunge the viewer immediately into the experience, we learn almost nothing of the soldiers, their motivations, their personal attachment or the conflicts within the unit.And this reflects a second, perhaps more serious, set of problems with Warfare. The solemn reverence for the integrity of the subject matter – the soldiers, and the recollections of the soldiers who fought in the engagement – leads to a kind of censorship by default. Largely missing from the picture are not only the Iraqis of Ramadi, where insurgents are seen as flitting figures and the civilian family in the house as a voiceless inconvenience, but any sense of how the soldiers view them.Warfare review – film-makers’ message gets lost in the deafening blizzard of battleRead moreThe reality is that many of the US soldiers I and other journalists encountered were frequently racist about Iraqis. And unlike the taciturn soldiers in Warfare, their views, for better or for worse, and their rationalisations for being in Iraq were often articulated even in situations of extremis.All of which leads to a final issue. In the decision not to articulate or aim for a wider parsing of a controversial and unpopular war, Garland excludes the possibility of any Iraqis in the film appearing as fully realised. The absence of Iraqis means that the war is merely something thathappensto these American soldiers. It is an experience to be endured and nothing more. The film’s sympathies may be anti-war but in its exclusive interest in the suffering of its young American protagonists, its viewpoint is colonial.And as artists who have successfully conveyed their vision of what they believe conflict means have long understood – from Homer and Tolstoy to Erich Maria Remarque and Joseph Heller, to Spielberg and Coppola – war is an activity that occurs in a human context. Separated from that context (and to steal from the title ofDavid Axe’s graphic novel and website), war is boring. It really is.Peter Beaumont is a senior international correspondent for the Guardian.

He understood the church had become too doctrinaire, divisive and judgmental for too many people. The drift of Catholics from conventional practice in the west said as much. He knew the church had alienated the LGBTQ community, discriminated against women and resisted full participation for divorced and remarried Catholics. He acknowledged that previous popes had not confronted the clerical sex abuse scandal.He wanted to do betterand the Catholic world was with him, the institution was not.The Catholic church by its nature is a conservative institution. It uses inertia as a management tool. Change is a slow and drawn-out affair. Francis regularly railed against clericalism because of its sense of entitlement and misuse of power. He saw it as one of the reasons why the church became obsessed with protecting its image instead of believing and caring for the victims of clerical sex abuse. He also realised the clerical instinct to protect their own and conceal their crimes was underpinned by their exclusive hold on the workings of the church.The Guardian view on Pope Francis: an outsider who was a force for good in the world | EditorialRead moreHe became determined to recalibrate the relationship between clerics and ordinary Catholics for there to be more mutuality and collaboration in church governance and decision-making. This did not win him friends within the church bureaucracy.To his credit Francis embarked on a personal conversion in his attitude and approach to the handling of the sex abuse scandal. As with his predecessors he shared their instinct to protect the image of the church before the welfare of victims. At times he also blamed the media for unjustified attacks on the church.Early in his papacy he took too long to believe the testimony of some victims and appeared to side with their abusers and the bishops who concealed the crimes. Butonce the scales fell from his eyeshe became resolute to impose a new regime of transparency and accountability. He famously summoned all theChilean bishops to Rome, dismissing many of them due to their mishandling of abuse cases in that country. He established a papal commission to advise on procedural reforms in the handling of sex abuse cases. He insisted the church adopt a “zero tolerance” culture in managing instances of the abuse of children by priests. He has tried to impose rigorous standards for the safeguarding of children and vulnerable people.His legacy in confronting the abuse scandal is still incomplete. TheVaticanbureaucracy slowed the pace of reform. It placed many canonical hurdles in its path. The church administration, even in Australia, still uses legal conventions to ward off the prospect of financial reparation payouts instead of taking moral stances to properly compensate its victims. Too many people still struggle against the might of the church to get justice.Francis was a refreshingly open and pastoral pope. He pushed the church to reach out to the marginalised. He said bridges needed to be built, but also walked across. He consistently reminded the church that inclusion was essential and respecting diversity was integral to the nature ofChristianity. He demonstrated through his own life that change is possible and mercy can be real. He has lit the path for us all.Francis Sullivan AO is the chair of Concerned Catholics Canberra Goulburn and the former CEO of the Catholic church’s Truth, Justice and Healing CouncilExplore more on these topicsPope FrancisOpinionCatholicismChristianityThe papacyReligionVaticancommentShareReuse this content"

We’re taking action to preserve government toolsMon 21 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Apr 2025 12.47 EDTShareUnited States science has propelled the country into its current position as apowerhouseof biomedical advancements, technological innovation and scientific research. The data US government agencies produce is a crown jewel – it helps us track how theclimate is changing, visualizeair pollution in our communities, identifychallenges to our healthand provide apanoply of other essential uses. Climate change, pandemics and novel risks are coming for all of us – whether we bury our heads in the sand or not – and government data is critical to our understanding of the risks these challenges bring and how to address them.Much of this data remainsout of sightto those who don’t use it, even though they benefit us all. Over the past few months, theTrump administrationhas brazenly attacked our scientific establishment throughagency firings,censorshipandfunding cuts, and it has explicitly targeteddatathe American taxpayers have paid for. They’re stealing from us and putting our health and wellbeing in danger – so now we must advocate for these federal resources.Fifteen years after Deepwater Horizon, Trump is setting the stage for disaster |  Terry GarciaRead moreThat’s why we at thePublic Environmental Data Partnersare working to preserve critical environmental data. We are a coalition of non-profits, academic institutions, researchers and volunteers who work with federal data to support policy, research, advocacy and litigation work. We are one node in an expansive web of organizations fighting for the data American taxpayers have funded and that benefits us all. The first phase of our work has been to identify environmental justice tools and datasets at risk through conversations with environmental justice groups, current and former employees in local, state, and federal climate and environment offices, and researchers. To date, we have saved over a hundred priority datasets and have reproduced six tools.We’re not fighting for data for data’s sake; we’re fighting for data because it helps us make sense of the world.The utility of many of these datasets and tools comes from the fact that they are routinely updated. While our efforts ensure that we have snapshots of these critical data sources and tools, it will be a huge loss if these cease to be updated entirely. That’s why we are “life rafting” tools outside of government – standing up copies of them on publicly accessible, non-government pages – hoping that we can return them to a future administration that cares about human and environmental health and does not view science as a threat.The second phase is to develop these tools, advocate for better data infrastructure, and increase public engagement. There’s a question of scope – if the government stops sharing National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration data, we don’t have the resources to start monitoring and tracking hurricanes. For many of these critical data sources, the government is the only entity with the resources to collect and publish this data – think about thethousands of weather stationsset up around the world or theglobal air pollution monitorsor thesprayofsatellitesorbiting the earth. On the other hand, we do have the expertise to build environmental justice tools that better serve the communities that have borne the brunt of environmental injustice, by co-creating with those communities and by building from what we have saved from the government – like the Council on Environmental Quality’sCEJST, the Environmental Protection Agency’sEJScreen, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’sSocial Vulnerability and Environmental Justicetools.The Nobel is just the start: 16 imagined victories for Donald Trump | Ariel DorfmanRead moreA common refrain of the saboteurs is that if these functions that they are targeting are important enough, the states or the private sector will step in to fill the gap. While some of these functions of the federal government are replicable outside of government, privatization will render them less accessible, more expensive and subject to the whims of the markets. The states can also step in and fill some gaps – but many of the biggest challenges that we’re facing are best tackled by a strong federal government. Furthermore, many states arehappily joining this anti-science crusade. The climate crisis and pandemics don’t stop politely at state borders. If data collection is left up to the states, the next pandemic will not leave a state untouched because it dismantled its public health department – but such actions will leave a gaping hole in our understanding of the risks to the residents of that state and its neighbors. What’s more, some states do not have the resources to stand up the infrastructure required to shoulder the burden of data collection. Coordination between federal and state governments is essential.Data is being stolen from us; our ability to understand the world is being stolen from us. Americans will die because theTrump administrationis abdicating its responsibility to the people – this censorship regime will have dire consequences. That’s why we must stand up for science, we must be loud about the importance of federal data and we must put the brakes on Trump’s un-American agenda.Jonathan Gilmour is a data scientist at Harvard’s TH Chan School of PublicHealth, a fellow at the Aspen Policy Academy, and coordinator at the Public Environmental Data Partners.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionTrump administrationUS politicsInfectious diseasesHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

But so has online radicalisation – and we can’t ignore thatMon 21 Apr 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Apr 2025 05.14 EDTShareFor decades, there has been a cultural narrative that the church is a declining institution, which has been backed up by data that shows fewer and fewer British people are attending services. You might expect churches to be busy over festivals like this past Easter weekend, or Christmas, but with otherwise sparse crowds and aging parishioners for the rest of the year.However, a recent survey entitledThe Quiet Revival, commissioned by the Bible Society and conducted by YouGov, shows that church attendance in England and Wales has actually increased by 50% over the past six years, and that young people aged between 18 and 24 are the second largest demographic in attendance (behind those who are 65 and over). The trend is especially strong with young men, with 21% aged 18 to 24 saying they attend church at least once a month, compared with 12% of young women. The data also shows that generation Z are particularly drawn to Roman Catholicism, which accounts for a significant rise in the number of Catholics in England, almost closing the overall gap between those who identify as Catholic and those who identify as Anglican.England and Wales are not alone in seeing more young men attending church, with the New York Times religion correspondent,Ruth Graham, reporting that the same trend can be seen across the US. Graham is blunt in her proposed reason for this, stating that men are less educated than their female peers, while also placing a higher value on traditional family structures, meaning that they find encouragement and reinforcement in conservative church communities.This is a somewhat unsympathetic reading of the circumstances, but when attempting to locate the possible influences on these young men, the landscape does look bleak. Thanks to the recentNetflix show Adolescence, there has been much public reckoning with the radicalisation of young boys and men through online spaces and podcasts that are overtly misogynistic – and plenty of these masquerade as platforms of Christian, specifically Catholic, values. The Instagram page warrior.4.christ acts as a Catholic “meme page”, with openly homophobic, antisemitic and culturally conservative content, posting quotes about anti-abortion movements and generally being against “liberalism”. There is very little interaction with actual biblical scripture or Catholic practice, beyond using a vaguely defined idea of it to justify a celebration of rightwing ideas and talking points.Tristan Tate, brother of the infamous male lifestyle influencer Andrew Tate, has also been vocal about his conversion to Christianity. The Tate brothers reside in Romania (where they arefacing charges of human trafficking, which they deny), and Tristan has spoken about the strong belief in God among Romanians that encouraged him to convert. He also identifies abortion as one of the topics that he now “takes seriously”. Tristan Tate and other influencers place emphasis on the real misogynistic or reactionary elements of some Christian movements, and make them part of their wider ecosystem of influence on young men and boys.View image in fullscreenA Micah food bank in Toxteth, Liverpool, based at St Vincent de Paul church.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe Bible Society’s report states that more research is needed to fully discern where a desire to join Christian faith communities has stemmed from. The murkier corners of the internet are very probably a factor, but I can’t help but remain cautiously optimistic about the findings. The report also highlights how a significant concern for all of the gen Z participants interviewed is social activism, with far more churchgoing interviewees recording that they do frequent community and charity work compared to those who are not church members. This work is recorded as donating to food banks, financial donations to charities, voting in elections, writing to local representatives and communal work such as litter picking. These are hopeful statistics that demonstrate a positive participation in society that is encouraged by churchgoing.What both of these possible influences highlight is an overriding wish for community, whether in the more rigid boundaries of the Catholic church, or in the collective work that English and Welsh churches of all denominations encourage and facilitate. An instinct towards a collective with a solid foundation is understandable in an age bracket that has had its education, whether in secondary school or university (or both), disrupted by a global pandemic. Where school or university should have provided a social outlet for young people alongside their education, necessity meant that they instead had isolated experiences.Truss social: the latest chapter from a woman who really knows what the people want | Zoe WilliamsRead moreOn top of this,years of austerity in England and Waleshas meant that community centres and public halls have drastically declined in numbers, with spending on libraries, theatres and museums falling. Young people looking for community may find that a local church or cathedral is the only place close to them with regular opening hours and people ready to talk and listen. That these same churches and cathedrals very often organise group charity work is a clear plus. In my own constituency area of Liverpool Riverside,Micah is the charitable armof Liverpool Cathedral and other churches, providing food and financial aid to local people in need, and it was a big reason for my own initial interest in joining the church.As a regular churchgoer, it would be lovely to celebrate the findings of The Quiet Revival and to leave it at that. However, the data is so unusual and unexpected that it invites analysis – and when digging for clues, not all of them are positive. What can be discerned is that more people are searching for meaning in an ever-changing and demonstrably politically unstable world, and they are finding this in multiple forms ofChristianity. This is good and should be celebrated – but as people who have a vested interest in our neighbours, we should also look out for signs of possible online radicalisation and tendencies towards hateful speech in the guise of Jesus’s influence.Jessica White is a writer based in LiverpoolDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In one, there are real pictures and footage of the world as it is: politics, sport, news and entertainment. In the other is AI slop, low-quality content with minimal human input. Some of it is banal and pointless – cartoonish images of celebrities, fantasy landscapes, anthropomorphised animals. And some is a sort of pornified display of women just simply … being, like a virtual girlfriend you cannot truly interact with. The range and scale of the content is staggering, and infiltrates everything from social media timelines to messages circulated onWhatsApp. The result is not just a blurring of reality, but a distortion of it.A new genre of AI slop is rightwing political fantasy. There are entireYouTube videosof made-up scenarios in which Trump officials prevail against liberal forces. The White House account on X jumped on a trend of creating images in Studio Ghibli style and posted animage of a Dominican woman in tearsas she is arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). AI political memefare has, in fact, gone global. Chinese AI videos mocking overweight US workers on assembly lines after the tariff announcementraised a questionfor, and response from, the White House spokesperson last week. The videos, she said, were made by those who “do not see the potential of the American worker”. And to prove how pervasive AI slop is, I had to triple-check that even that response was not itself quickly cobbled-together AI content fabricating another dunk on Trump’s enemies.The impulse behind this politicisation of AI is not new; it is simply an extension of traditional propaganda. What is new is how democratised and ubiquitous it has become, and how it involves no real people or the physical constraints of real life, therefore providing an infinite number of fictional scenarios.The fact that AI content is also spread through huge and ubiquitous chat channels such as WhatsApp means that there are no replies or comments to challenge its veracity. Whatever you receive is imbued with the authority and reliability of the person who has sent it. I am in a constant struggle with an otherwise online-savvy elderly relative who receives and believes a deluge of AI content on WhatsApp about Sudan’s war. The images and videos look real to her and are sent by people she trusts. Even absorbing that technology is capable of producing content with such verisimilitude is difficult. Combine this with the fact that the content chimes with her political desires and you have a degree of stickiness, even when some doubt is cast on the content. What is emerging, amid all the landfill ofgiant balls of cats, is the use of AI to create, idealise and sanitise political scenarios by rendering them in triumphant or nostalgic visual language.Prof Roland Meyer, a scholar of media and visual culture,notes one particular“recent wave of AI-generated images of white, blond families presented by neofascist online accounts as models of a desirable future”. He attributes this not just to the political moment, but to the fact that “generative AI is structurally conservative, even nostalgic”. Generative AI is trained on pre-existing data, which research has shown isinherently biasedagainst ethnic diversity, progressive gender roles and sexual orientations, therefore concentrating those norms in the output.0:54Donald Trump shares bizarre AI-generated video of 'Trump Gaza' – videoThe same can be seen in “trad wife” content, which summons not only beautiful supplicant homemakers, but an entire throwback world in which men can immerse themselves. X timelines are awash with a sort of clothed nonsexual pornography, as AI images of women described as comely, fertile and submissive glimmer on the screen. White supremacy, autocracy, and fetishisation of natural hierarchies in race and gender are packaged as nostalgia for an imagined past. AI is already being described asthe new aesthetic of fascism.But it isn’t always as coherent as that. Most of the time, AI slop is just content-farming chaos. Exaggerated or sensationalised online material boosts engagement, giving creators the chance to make money based on shares, comments and so on. Journalist Max Readfound that Facebook AI slop– the sloppiest of them all – is, “as far as Facebook is concerned”, not “junk”, but “precisely what the company wants: highly engaging content”. To social media giants, content is content; the cheaper it is, the less human labour it involves, the better. The outcome is an internet of robots, tickling human users into whatever feelings and passions keep them engaged.But whatever the intent of its creators, this torrent of AI content leads to the desensitisation and overwhelming of visual palates. The overall effect of being exposed to AI images all the time, from the nonsensical to the soothing to the ideological, is that everything begins to land in a different way. In the real world, US politicianspose outside prison cages of deportees. Students at US universities areambushedin the street and spirited away. People in Gazaburnalive. These pictures and videos join an infinite stream of others that violate physical and moral laws. The result is profound disorientation. You can’t believe your eyes, but also what can you believe if not your eyes? Everything starts to feel both too real and entirely unreal.I can’t delete WhatsApp’s new AI tool. But I’ll use it over my dead body | Polly HudsonRead moreCombine that with the necessary trivialisation and provocative brevity of the attention economy and you have a grand circus of excess. Even when content is deeply serious, it is presented as entertainment or, as an intermission, in a sort of visual elevator music. Horrified by Donald Trump and JD Vance’s attack on Zelenskyy? Well, here is anAI renderingof Vance as a giant baby. Feeling stressed and overwhelmed? Here is some eye balm – acabin with a roaring fire and snow falling outside. Facebook has for some reason decided I need to see a constant stream of compact, cutesystudio apartmentswith a variation of “this is all I need” captions.And the rapid mutation of the algorithm then feeds users more and more of what it has harvested and deemed interesting to them. The result is that all media consumption, even for the most discerning users, becomes impossible to curate. You are immersed deeper and deeper into subjective worlds rather than objective reality. The result is a very weird disjuncture. The sense of urgency and action that our crisis-torn world should inspire is instead blunted by how information is presented. Here, there is a new way of sleepwalking into disaster. Not through lack of knowledge, but through the paralysis caused by every event being filtered through this perverse ecosystem – just another part of the maximalist visual and memetic show.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionSocial mediaWhatsAppXFacebookYouTubecommentShareReuse this content"

The US president has said that the EU was created to “screw the United States” and slapped punitive tariffs on European goods. He has cast doubt on the US commitment to defend Nato allies. He has cosied up to Vladimir Putin, insulted Volodymyr Zelenskyy and tried to settle Russia’s war in Ukraine on terms that would undermine European security. His vice-president has denigrated European democratic values, and his national security team has spewed venom in a Signal chat at“pathetic” Europe.Yet the dark Trumpian clouds have a silver lining if we Europeans play our cards right. The advent of an illiberal, authoritarian nationalist regime in our closest ally may yet be a blessing in disguise if it helps European leaders tear down longstanding self-imposed obstacles to integration. Just think of the multiple opportunities to make Europe great again:Finally complete the European capital markets union and banking union to unleash the cross-border investment power of some €3tn in European savingsStrike trade deals with countries and regions around the world, seeking a reliable partner committed to cutting tariffs rather than weaponising themJointly develop common defence capabilities to strengthen the European wing of Nato and be able to defend European interests if the US withdraws or steps asideProvide Ukraine with greater military assistance, including medium-range missiles to fill the US gap and strengthen its position before any negotiationBuild international coalitions to defend liberal democracy, and uphold a rules-based order with like-minded partners from Canada to Japan, India and AustraliaExpand economic partnerships with middle- and low-income countries in Asia, Africa and South America that consider the EU a more reliable partner than a protectionistUS or a predatory Russia, and a valuable hedge against excessive dependence onChinaOffer a special visa programme to attract US scientists and tech workers fleeing Trump’s university crackdownMoreover, we can do all this without forfeiting a transatlantic economic partnership that remains the world’s biggest business relationship, withtwo-way investment north of $5tn in 2023. The EU remains the biggest single market in the world, with about 448 million consumers and an attractive business location for companies seeking political stability, the rule of law and a skilled workforce. That’s whyUS investment continues to pour into Francedespite high tax levels and regulation.On trade, the EU has rightly held back from kneejerk retaliation for each haphazard announcement from the White House while making clear its willingness to use all its powers, including potentially against US tech giants, if Trump does not accept an equitable solution. The jury is still out on prospects of a negotiated settlement, but the EU must work in the medium term to make its economy less reliant on exports to the US and China.Trump’s arbitrarily calculated tariffs and slashing of development and humanitarian assistance, as well as ending US support for democracy and human rights promotion around the world, have increased demand for European engagement – not just to plug the gaps left by the sudden cutoff of US aid but also to build sustained relationships. Sadly, some big European countries are alsoreducing their aid budgetsto pay for extra defence spending.Apart from the jolt from Trump’s hostile actions, there’s another reason to believe the EU may finally achieve some of the critical advances that have proved elusive in the last decade: leadership. Germany is under new management, and its incoming chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has demonstrated he’swilling to throw outdecades of balanced-budget dogma to revive a stagnant economy, build a more robust defence and repair his country’s broken infrastructure.Donald Trump is now badly wounded. Europe can seize an advantage | Will HuttonRead moreThe centre-right Merz, who will lead acentrist coalitionbetween his Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats, hasdeclared his ambitionto revive German leadership in the EU, in partnership with French president Emmanuel Macron and Polish prime minister Donald Tusk. He also wants to draw the UK into a closer security and defence embrace with the EU and work with Keir Starmer, both to build a stronger rampart against Putin’s aggression and in the hope of a longer-term economic rapprochement to overcome the damage of Brexit.Historically, European integration tends to accelerate during crises and slacken when the pressure is off. The EU now faces twin existential challenges from a ruthless, revisionist Putin and a vandalistic, unpredictable Trump. Add to that a third, internal challenge from nationalist populism that could tear the union apart if the current generation of leaders doesn’t give Europe a fundamental new impulse.If pro-Putin populists in Hungary and Slovakia block the use of EU institutions to achieve these objectives, then governments should create coalitions of willing states to take the necessary decisions, supported by the European Commission wherever possible.European leaders must invest their political capital together decisively now to turn the Trump disaster into an opportunity for Europe.Paul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy CentreExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionEuropean UnionTrump tariffscommentShareReuse this content"

Mr Kirsch, who is 66 and has severe learning difficulties, suffered abuse in a previous placement. That home, Mendip House, was closed down. Now his family fear another disruption is on the way. For nine years he has been looked after by Somerset Care, but this organisation has said that it can’t keep going on the 0% annual rise offered by Haringey, the London council that funds him. Mr Kirsch may be evicted as a result.His past bad experience makes this story particularly dismaying. But the threat hanging over him is in no way unique. For every dispute over social care costs that garners press attention, there are many others that stay hidden.A 0% increase is tough for providers at any time. But steeply rising costs mean it is currently untenable. This month’s increase in employer national insurance contributions has left the social care sector with an estimated £2.8bn bill – and no way of meeting it except by putting up fees. Disturbingly, not-for-profits such as Somerset Care areparticularly exposedto these financial risks since they rely heavily on council funding. By contrast, homes with more privately funded residents are in a better position to cross-subsidise places and meet shortfalls.Already, charitable care providers have begunhanding back contracts, and there are fears that for‑profit, private-equity-backed businesses could be the only bidders left if non-profits exit the market rather than slash costs. Yet despite this worsening situation on the ground, and warnings of the demographic and financial challenges dating back years, a policy solution to the UK’s social care crisis is still years off.Louise Casey, the person chosen by Sir Keir Starmer’s government to find a solution and build a cross-party consensus around funding, is widely respected for her bold interventions in highly contested areas. But diverting her from social care to produce ashort report on grooming, as ministers did in January, sent a terrible message about the lack of urgency that bedevils this issue. It should have been possible to find someone else in order that the social care work could begin straight away.Given recent upheavals in health policy, it is no wonder that social care is once againstuck on the sidelines. The decision toabolish NHS England, and the upcoming launch of a 10-year plan, are enough to keep any health secretary busy – even one as ambitious as Wes Streeting. But the dangers of doing nothing are not limited to the distress caused to individuals and families caught in the middle of conflicts like the one described above. There is also the risk that the sector as a whole is weakened by further delays.The problems are UK-wide. Scottish non‑profitssent their own appealto the chancellor in November, after the SNP governmentscrapped plansfor a Scottish national care service. Organisations across the country deserve better from politicians, as do the vulnerable people whose needs they were set up to meet.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Sadly, this Maundy Thursday encounter turned out to be one of the last acts of a supremely hardworking papacy. In retrospect, its location was entirely appropriate.Throughout his 12 years in Saint Peter’s chair, Francis sought admirably to refocus the Catholic church’s energies on the marginalised, while challenging the power of entrenched interests. Coming, as heput it, “from the ends of the earth”, the first non-European pontiff of modern times was an outsider pope and a radical one. Within the church, the Argentine was a sometimes spikily direct reformer; outside it, he was a significant, high-profile ally of progressive causes.As inward-looking nationalist movements dragged the west’s political compass steadily rightwards, Francis became an increasingly essentialcounterweighton interconnected issues such as migration, global heating and the fate of the global south.Laudato Si, his impassioned encyclical dedicated to the challenge of the climate emergency, was a moral and philosophical tour de force explicitly addressed to all people of good will.In the Vatican, Francis made it his mission to modernise – with mixed success – a church hierarchy which he viewed as remote and self-satisfied. This task he memorablycomparedin 2018 to “cleaning the Sphinx of Egypt with a toothpick”. Condemnations of clerical arrogance were accompanied by an exhortation that the church should better engage with the messiness of human lives. In one of his most arresting descriptions of the kind of church that he wished to create, heimaginedit “as ‘a field hospital’ concerned more with those who suffer than defending its own interests”.Emphasising compassion over doctrinal rigidity, and making plenty of conservative enemies along the way, Francis revived the more open, tolerant spirit of thesecond Vatican councilin the 1960s. Encapsulated in hisreplyto a question about gay people in the church – “Who am I to judge?” – this pastoral emphasis benefited the everyday lives of millions of Catholics.Blessings for unmarried and same-sex couples are now in place, along with a relaxation of rules barring divorcees and remarried people from receiving communion. Women play agreaterrole in running Catholic institutions, although they are no nearer to being admitted to the priesthood. The global debate that Francis initiated among Catholics about the future of their church – thesynod on synodality– galvanised the grassroots.Traditionalists railed at these changes, some to the point of questioning Francis’s papal legitimacy. Liberals inside and outside the church would argue that they could have gone much further, encompassing at least the introduction offemale deacons, for example, and same sex-marriage. As a non-doctrinaire theological conservative, Francis was never likely to satisfy either camp. His achievements as an outward-facing pope, engaged with the world and its crises, should nevertheless be seen as considerable.In an era when the postwar legacy of universal human rights is under threat, and Christianity isweaponisedin the west as a form of identity politics, Francis stood up for a gospel message of humility, inclusion and love for the stranger. By a quirk of fate, one of his last public engagements was an Easter Sundaymeetingwith the Catholic US vice-president, JD Vance, whose “America first” views on international aid and migration he had trenchantlycriticisedbefore falling ill. Progressives of all faiths and none will miss that urgent advocacy on behalf of those whose own voices are too seldom listened to.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The explosion of corporate-style executive roles in schools is an outrage and a tragic betrayal of the students and teachers at those institutions.While I was headteacher of a local authority secondary school, at least two heads of neighbouring schools acquired single-academy trust status for their schools, persuaded their governors to promote them to the new position of “executive head” on an increased salary, appointed a “head of school” on a lower salary to run the school, and effectively sat back. Suddenly, and for no discernible benefit to students, the cost of headship had doubled.Meanwhile, as Crawshaw documents, multi-academy trusts (Mats) spawn even more newly created, costly and superfluous positions, sucking in more and more schools to enhance and justify the inflated executive pay. And, inevitably, the services provided by the local authority diminish for everyone else as schools leave to become academies.The principal losers, of course, are the young people these schools are meant to serve – but also all those demoralised teachers who are not motivated by the same venal values and who struggle on with larger class sizes and fewer support services.CEO and executive headteacher roles in schools are non-jobs. Each school needs a headteacher who is passionate about the education and wellbeing of students in that school, supported by adequate funding and good support services. They do not need corporate managers.Name and address suppliedThe academy system for schools is sucking the life and finances out of our education system. I have knowledge, from a family member, of a high school becoming part of a multi-academy trust. They saw changes that were supposed to be of benefit to the children, but actually are more like benefits for the senior leadership.One example is trips abroad, requiring long-haul flights, by senior school staff to “observe” overseas teaching methods. Another example is senior leadership meetings taking place in expensive settings, with expensive catering.These privileges do not extend to support staff, who are expected to bring their own teabags to school and even provide cups of tea for visitors and interviewees out of their own supply. This might just about be acceptable, on the grounds of using every penny of funding directly for the children and if making savings applied to all staff across the board, but it doesn’t. Support staff, on minimum wage, have even had to take on the roles of speech therapists and educational psychologists due to funding shortages. Tellingly, the job title of “school bursar” has become “business manager”.A school should be a centre for learning, not a business. From what I can gather, financial accountability is not what it used to be. The reasons for the funding shortages need to be looked at more closely.Caroline TollemacheLondonJonny Crawshaw’s letter highlights a problem also seen in primary school multi-academy trusts, even small ones. CEOs, CFOs and other middle management staff (with salaries ranging from £110,000 to £140,000) can drain away precious resources that should have been used for teaching assistants and teachers in schools with strained budgets.The services provided cost significantly more than the ones provided by the local authority. For a Mat of eight schools, £500,000 is a lot of money to divert from education, especially in view of the fact that schools are beingforced to make teachersandteaching assistantsredundant to avoid going into deficit. It is about time that the Department for Education audited the use of general annual grant money by Mats. Ofsted or DfE inspection of Mats would also be welcome.Lia CamposCambridgeHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I read Dr Robert Harrison’s letter (14 April) with scepticism. He writes eloquently of students using technology in “healthy, purposeful, and life-enhancing” ways. This sounds lovely, but very far from the reality that we are living.My five-year-old’s school has furnished parents with no fewer than five technology platforms where we interact with the school; this does not include the many parentWhatsAppgroups. Every swimming lesson, scout troop and karate class requires a new online platform. My son obviously doesn’t use these platforms, but does see me swearing at my phone whenever I try to log on to one since I cannot possibly remember so many passwords.My graduate students similarly interact with multiple educational platforms each time they have to do something simple like follow a reading list or find a journal article. When one of these platforms is changed or adapted (which happens often), our entire teaching staff, including administrators, spend months learning how to use the new system and asking for the students’ patience while we navigate them.I am at the point where every time I open an educational technology platform, I can feel my brain melting.Schoolscannot teach a “balanced, nuanced approach” to technology when teachers and parents are so overstimulated by screens.

Scott Parker decided it was more sensible to chisel their way out, inch by inch, completing their route to freedom with a tense victory againstSheffield United.Amid the change of owners, mana­gers and styles the captain, Josh Brownhill, has been a mainstay and it was ­fitting his two goals completed the pains­taking job. Parker’s promotion push has been the polar ­opposite to ­Kompany’s approach. The ­Belgian’s ­all-conquering side played fast, aggressive, attacking football, whereas the current style is based on discipline and defensive organisation.Burnleyhave conceded 15 goals in 44 games, a record anyone would be proud of and the foundation of their success.Leeds promoted to Premier League after Piroe’s four-goal salvo in Stoke routRead moreIt was always going to be a nervous 90 minutes against Sheffield United, who started the match five points behind and maintained a chance of catching Burnley. The opening exchanges lacked quality but not aggression as the two teams wanted to show their desire for promotion. Late challenges were the norm until Gustavo Hamer was cautioned for a needless kick on Brownhill to gift the hosts a free-kick.From the set piece came the opener. The ball was worked out from the right to Marcus Edwards, whose cross belatedly landed at Josh Cullen’s feet. He aimed towards the corner, only for Michael Cooper to palm away. The waiting Brownhill smashed into the roof of the net, taking Turf Moor’s off in the same moment.Considering Burnley had not conceded twice in a league match all season, a turnaround was already a difficult task for Sheffield United, even with more than an hour to play. This was not a message received by Tom Cannon, whose smart run allowed him to latch on to Hamer’s pass and beat James Trafford with a ferocious strike. It was his first goal for the club since joining in January.Chris Wilder has looked frustrated in recent weeks as his side have slipped behind Burnley and Leeds. They were serious rivals for an automatic promotion spot, even ­favourites, before losing three matches in a row, a fatal error when the situation was so tight, hindered by lapses in concentration.The leveller increased the tension inside the stadium, although that was soon relieved when Anel Ahmedhodzic decided to kick Hannibal Mejbri up in the air inside the penalty area, leaving Wilder perplexed. Brownhill took responsibility, sending Cooper the wrong way to return the home support to a state of delirium. Brownhill punched the air with delight and encouraged more noise.Seeing things through is a core part of Parker’s strategy, exemplified by him taking off their most dangerous player in Edwards just after the hour mark and replacing him with the stoic central midfielder Josh Laurent. While Burnley were putting more behind the ball, Wilder sent on Tyrese Campbell and Jesurun Rak-Sakyi in search of an equaliser against a team offering up few chances.View image in fullscreenBrownhill and his teammates go wild with the home fans.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PATrafford has rebuilt his ­reputation as one of the country’s best young goalkeepers after struggling in ­Burnley’s error-ridden season in the top flight under Kompany, when they conceded an average of more than two a game. It has been very different this year with Connor ­Roberts, CJ Egan-Riley, Maxime Estève and Bashir Humphreys or Lucas Pires in front of him, but Trafford has still regularly produced vital saves, most notably in the goalless draw against Sunderland in January when he repelled two late penalties.There were no such big moments in this match as Trafford easily coped with everything thrown at him in the second half to leave Wilder with the tricky task of the playoffs. “We’ve ­finished third and we’ve taken it deep,” Wilder said. “We have to use this as fuel and motivation, reset and go again in the playoffs.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His previous two experiences resulted in him being relegated with Fulham and sacked after four games when in charge of Bournemouth. His ­complaint with the latter was that they did not have enough quality in the squad and Burnley will need to invest intelligently in the summer, and avoid losing any of his key men, if they are to compete, but they could be better equipped than Kompany’s version thanks to their defensive solidity.Last season’s promoted teams are all set to come back down with few points on the table, showing the ever growing gap between the divisions. Not that anyone celebrating the promotion was contemplating anything more than the immediate party.As the full-time whistle blew, the Burnley substitutes sprinted onto the pitch, soon joined by thousands of fans, leaping over the hoardings to join their heroes and antagonise the Blades. “It was quite scary,” Wilder said. “I don’t think we were protected by the football club or the stewards.”Parker made a quick escape to the stands to embrace his wife and speak with the club’s owners who believed in his vision.

The way we compete is as a team.”Although Forest had to tweak their back four because of Ola Aina’s absence through injury, with Harry Toffolo coming in for his first league start of the season at left-back, there was little sign of expectation weighing them down.The home fans must have ­wondered if the team in red could possibly have been coached by the same man who was deemed too negative before beingsacked after four unhappy monthsin charge here in 2021. Nuno had Forest playing on the front foot, even if the omission of Callum Hudson-Odoi had suggested a more measured approach before kick-off, and it was not long before they exposed frailties within ­Postecoglou’s setup.View image in fullscreenNottingham Forest’s Matz Sels makes a save from Tottenham’s Richarlison.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersSpurs were not in the zone despite Postecoglou making five changes to the side thatsaw off Eintracht F­rankfurt. They seemed startled by Forest’s intensity and did not even wake up after seeing Morgan Gibbs-White test Guglielmo Vicario with a stinging drive in the fourth minute.Forest went ahead from the resulting corner. Anthony Elanga’s delivery was disappointing but Pedro Porro’s clearance was worse, exposing a lack of organisation. There was no ­pressure on Anderson when the ball fell to him on the edge of the area, allowing the midfielder to drive through a shot that flicked off Rodrigo Bentancur and beat Vicario for power.The venom of Anderson’s strike shook Spurs, who looked flimsy next to such conviction. This is why ­Postecoglou’s position is so vulnerable, even with a Europa League ­semi-final against Bodø/Glimt to come. He chose not to rest Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven in central defence, but Spurs remained feeble in the face of Forest’s directness.The crosses kept coming. Spurs could not handle Wood. The striker had one effort disallowed for offside but soon made it 2-0, rising unchallenged to head past a flapping Vicario. Porro, standing off, had done nothing to stop Elanga’s inswinging cross.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wilson Odobert, Mathys Tel and Richarlison had chances. The thought occurred that Spurs would have been better served by trying harder when it was 0-0.Postecoglou was pushing it when he claimed that his side played “outstanding” football. “It’s another game we’ve lost we shouldn’t lose,” he said. “We make things really difficult for ourselves in key moments. We gave away poor goals. It’s too many losses. I know that.”Forest adjusted during the break, gearing themselves up for a rearguard action by replacing Elanga with ­Morato, who joined Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic in the middle of a back five. This was Nuno showing his flexibility, adjusting to circumstance in a way that Postecoglou rarely does. The danger, though, was inviting pressure. It was not done yet.Forest went close to a third, Gibbs-White missing a good chance, but Spurs stirred. Toffolo, whose diligence after coming in from the cold summed up Forest’s unity, cleared Dejan Kulusevski’s header off the line. Matz Sels twice thwarted Richarlison.Spurs enhanced their attack, Dominic Solanke and Brennan Johnson coming on, and they broke through when Richarlison glanced Porro’s cross past Sels after 87 minutes.Forest had to survive seven added minutes, Nuno praying for the final whistle. The celebrations at the end were gleeful. Forest head to ­Wembley on Sunday, an FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City there to be won, and will keep dreaming. Out of the top five before the start of play, the question was whether they could handle the pressure. Their response was resounding.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTottenham HotspurNottingham Forestmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Does venting emotion harm performance in elite sport? | Sean IngleRead more“For now there is no real thing set in stone but we’re taking it week to week and he’s helping me as much as he can alongside his current commitments.”Raducanu had arrived at the Miami Open last month on a trial with the Slovak coach Vladimir Platenik before opting to dissolve their prospective partnership onthe eve of the tournament. She instead enlisted the help of Petchey, Andy Murray’s former coach, who was in Miami for his role as a broadcaster on the Tennis Channel. They were joined there by the former player Jane O’Donoghue, Raducanu’s close friend. The 22-year-old enjoyed their time together so much that she has continued their partnership despite significant obstacles.After Miami, which was her seventh tournament in two months, Raducanu withdrew from the Billie Jean King Cup and the WTA 250 event in Rouen in order to “rest and recover” while executing a 10-day training block with Petchey in Los Angeles.“We created our own little bubble and it was nice to be working on my game out there but at the same time having fun and enjoying it,” she said.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu celebrates defeating Emma Navarro during her run to the quarter-finals of the Miami Open.Photograph: SMG/ShutterstockPetchey will be in Madrid this week,along with O’Donoghue, but Raducanu stated that he is “fitting me in around” his other commitments. Still, she is satisfied: “I’m happy with the set-up going forward right now – it’s been working well. I like him a lot and I’ve known him since before the US Open and it’s nice to have familiar faces around.”Like many of Raducanu’s choices, opting to work informally with a coach is unconventional. She says that it has been difficult to handle the scrutiny she has been under every time she makes a decision but she is slowly learning how to block out the noise and lean on the people around her. “It’s really difficult, because I think every decision I make is made on such a big scale that it’s up for judgment,” she said.“Every time I step on the court, every time I kind of make a choice, it is up for judgment. And I just need to get to a place where I’m comfortable enough and secure enough in what I’m doing that it doesn’t matter what other people are saying.“Over the last few years, that is, truthfully, something that I have been kind of toiling with, because I would care about what people think. I think just in general, in my life, like anytime someone’s upset with me or something, it affects me.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And that way I can express myself and, not even about the tennis, just feel a better person, just feel happier and lighter.”As she stressed throughout the run, Raducanu believes that the lesson fromher performances in Miamiis to ensure that finds enjoyment in her daily life while also pursuing her goals: “I think I’m just trying to keep things more lighthearted off the court, like I’m getting on site, and then trying to just get on get off, like, pretty soon,” she said.“That has helped me, and then just doing things outside that makes me happy. Like, for example, yesterday I just did a yoga class. It was just random.“I’ll go on hikes. I’ll just do things that maybe, like, in the moment, or previously, I would be like: ‘Oh, maybe it’s not so professional; I need to just be locked in like, 200% of my day.’ But now I’m a lot more like: ‘No,’ because when I’m locked in I am so focused on the court, I give 200%.

That loss saw Leicester slump to a record ninth successive top-flight home defeat without scoring a goal.Acquiescence trumps apocalypse as Leicester’s demise is confirmed | Jonathan WilsonRead moreVardy, the Leicester captain, is out of contract at the end of the season and it is unclear whether the club will offer him a new deal. The 38-year-old signed a 12-month deal following promotion last summer.In a message posted on social media on Monday, Vardy said: “No words I have can ever express my feelings of anger and sadness with the way this season has gone. There are no excuses.“Collectively, as players and as a club, we failed. There is simply no hiding, and I refuse to entertain any suggestion of doing so. Having been at this club for so long, we’ve experienced so many highs and successes – and this season has been nothing but miserable and for me personally, a total embarrassment. It hurts, and I know you’re feeling it too.“To the fans: I’m sorry. Sorry we haven’t performed, and sorry we end the 2025 season with such a s*** show.”The former England striker, who joined the club from Fleetwood in a £1m deal in 2011, is regarded as one of Leicester’s greatest players having played a key role in winning thePremier League in 2015-16and theFA Cup in 2020-21.The future of Leicester manager Ruud van Nistelrooy is also uncertain, with the Dutchman expected to hold talks with the club’s hierarchy this week. He is under contract until 2027 but his position is in serious doubt.Leicester have sounded out potential successors in recent weeks. Van Nistelrooy said the club must make a quick decision to allow the team to progress. “The club has to use this time, otherwise you will waste it,” he said on Sunday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fair enough. It’s an unusual race if there isn’t at least one team indignant at a decision that has not gone their way.However, the Dutchman soon appeared in a more vituperative frame of mind. Firstly, he declined to answer a question on the penalty incident when interviewed after climbing from his car. Then in the official FIA press conference he made the reason for his reticence explicit.“The problem is that I cannot share my opinion about it because I might get penalised also, so it’s better not to speak about it,” he said.When asked to explain he was clear. “I know I cannot swear in here but at the same time, you also can’t be critical in any form that might ‘harm’ or ‘danger’. Let me get the sheet out, there’s a lot of lines, you know? So that’s why it’s better not to talk about it. You can put yourself in trouble, and I don’t think anyone wants that.”What might have seemed an obtuse reference was patently clear to everyone within F1. Verstappen was almost certainly referring to the changes to FIA regulations for 2025 that introduced a series of draconian penalties for swearing or criticising the governing body.The swearing part is self-explanatory – pull a Sex Pistols on the Bill Grundy show and you’re busted – but it is worth quoting the other addition to the sporting code that forbids: “Any words, deeds or writings that have caused moral injury or loss to the FIA, its bodies, its members or its executive officers, and more generally on the interest of motor sport and on the values defended by the FIA.”This was what Verstappen was referring to on “the sheet” when he said “harm” or “danger”. The penalties for either offence – and it should be noted the second could make any critical comment potentially in breach – are a series of fines starting at €40,000 and rising to €120,000 for a third offence that would be accompanied by one month suspension from the championship. The latter would be catastrophic for any driver in a title fight.It is understood the changes were instigated by the FIA president, Mohammed Ben Sulayem, and considered by many as an attempt to suppress criticism.Verstappen has been generally much more short and guarded in press conferences this season, which he attributed in Jeddah to being misinterpreted on social media. “I prefer not to talk a lot because sometimes your words can be twisted or people interpret it in a different way. It’s honestly better not to say too much,” he said.Such a position is not unusual these days but equally what could not be misinterpreted was that with the few words he was willing to use, his ire was specifically aimed at the FIA regulations. He is far from alone in that stance.Verstappen was already at odds with the FIA after being penalised for swearing in a press conference at the Singapore GP last year. Before that weekend Ben Sulayem had made his position clear, stating he did not want drivers to swear, comparing it unfavourably to rap artists. Lewis Hamilton dismissed this comment as being influenced by a racial bias and stereotyping, while Lando Norris and Verstappen were among other drivers who also felt there was no need to pursue such a trivial matter.Verstappen chose to poke the bear only a day later and after his penalty warned that such pettiness could prompt him to leave the sport.Oscar Piastri storms to Saudi Arabian F1 GP win and now leads title raceRead moreThere was widespread support and sympathy for him from the drivers and shortly afterwards the body representing them, the Grand Prix Drivers’ Association, issued a public statement to the FIA demanding they stop treating drivers like children They also addressed the swearing controversy and took issue with the “tone and ­language” used by Ben Sulayem in relation to his ­objections and ­questioned the financial ­transparency of the FIA, in how the organisation used the money from fines.When the FIA did not respond George Russell, a GPDA director, stated drivers were “fed up” with the situation and warned it was going in the “wrong direction”.Verstappen is a canny operator and knows where a few well-chosen words, or indeed declining to comment, will be most effective; he would also have been aware of the timing, with Ben Sulayem’s tenure under the spotlight.View image in fullscreenGeorge Russell said F1 drivers are ‘fed up’ with the situation concerning the new FIA regulations.Photograph: Jakub Porzycki/ReutersLess than two weeks ago the FIA’s deputy president for sport, Robert Reid, announced his resignation, citing what he called “a fundamental breakdown in governance standards” and “critical decisions being made without due process”. He is the latest member of senior personnel to have depart since Ben Sulayem took over.Reid’s resignation came just after the chair of Motorsport UK, David Richards, published an open letter expressing a growing number of people had legitimate concerns that: “The governance and constitutional organisation of the FIA is becoming ever more opaque and concentrating power in the hands of the president alone”.Verstappen will now doubtless switch his focus to the next round in Miami in two weeks but he has made his point and it is one expected to be aired vigorously again in Florida.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMax VerstappenRed BullMotor sportcommentShareReuse this content"

The World Test Championship, the book argues, is a “shambles masquerading as a showpiece”.The publication of the sport’s annual bible is timely, with the future of the WTC discussed recently at ICC meetings in ­Zimbabwe. In typically opaque fashion, the sport’s governing body is yet to announce the outcome of the debate.Nat Sciver-Brunt lined up to be next England captain by new coach EdwardsRead moreSources suggest the 2025-27 WTC is likely to remain the same, with nine teams and an asymmetrical two‑year fixture list producing two finalists. Writing in his notes the Wisden editor, Lawrence Booth, has made the case for a four-year all‑play‑all format, highlighting South Africa’s spot in the final at Lord’s this summer despite a paltry diet of two-match series and having faced neither ­England nor Australia en route.“Among the first items in [the ICC chair Jay] Shah’s in-tray ought to be the World Test ­Championship, a shambles masquerading as a ­showpiece,” Booth writes. “This is not South Africa’s fault. It may even be to their benefit, if the path from laughing stocks to Lord’s persuades their board that Test cricket is worth saving.“The ICC cannot allow the championship to continue as if designed on the back of a fag packet. Double its length to four years, like football and rugby, and ensure the top nine in the rankings all play each other, home and away, over series of at least three Tests.”The catch, as ever, is India’s ongoing refusal to play in Pakistan on geopolitical grounds – something that came to a head during the recentChampions ­Trophywhen Rohit Sharma’s eventual winners were based in Dubai for the entire tourna­ment. This in turn highlighted India’s domi­nance at board level, with Shah having switched from secretary of the Board of ­Control for Cricket in India to ICC chair last December while the issue was being debated.Booth writes: “The communal shrug [that met Shah’s appointment] confirmed a sorry truth: 2024 was the year cricket gave up any claim to being properly administered, with checks, balances, and governance for the many, not the few. India already had the monopoly: now they had hotels on Park Lane and Mayfair.”Elsewhere Wisden features moving first-person tributes to Graham Thorpe by Alec Stewart and Thorpe’s wife, Amanda, with the latter keen to raise awareness and understanding of the depression and anxiety that led the former England batter to take his own life last August. “Some people say suicide is selfish,” Amanda Thorpe writes. “But I have so much compassion for what he went through. He didn’t deserve it. No one does.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The researchers found traces of it remained in brook trout in some lakes, often at levels 10 times higher than the recommended safety threshold for wildlife.“DDT is a probable carcinogen that we haven’t used in 70 years here [Canada], yet it’s abundant in fish and lake mud throughout much of the province at shockingly high levels,” said Josh Kurek, an associate professor in environmental change and aquatic biomonitoring at Mount Allison University in Canada and lead author of the research.The research,published in the journal Plos One, discovered that DDT pollution covers about 50% of New Brunswick province. Brook trout is the most common wild fish caught in the region, and the research found DDT was present in its muscle tissue, in some cases 10 times above the recommended Canadian wildlife guidelines.Researchers said DDT, which is classified by health authorities as a“probable carcinogen”, can persist in lake mud for decades after treatment and that many lakes in New Brunswick retain such high levels of legacy DDT that the sediments are a key source of pollution in the food web.“The public, especially vulnerable populations to contaminants such as women of reproductive age and children, need to be aware of exposure risk to legacy DDT through consumption of wild fish,” said Kurek.Throughout the 1950s and 60s, half the province’s conifer forests were sprayed with DDT, a synthetic insecticide used to control insects carrying diseases such as malaria and typhus. Canada banned the use of the substance in the 1980s.The 2001 Stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants banned DDT worldwide for mass agricultural use, although it is still permitted in small quantities for malaria control.“This mess can’t be cleaned up,” said Kurek. “DDTs can persist in lake mud for decades to centuries and then cycle in the food web. The best approach is to manage the public’s exposure of legacy DDTs by encouraging everyone to follow fish consumption guidelines and consider reducing exposure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, is also expected to attend.French officials said the five countries held an “excellent” day of talks in Paris last week, with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, urging those present to put pressure on Moscow to end the fighting.Britain and France, backed by a “coalition of the willing”, have already proposed providing a “reassurance” force for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire, but the US has so far held off its support.After last Thursday’s meeting, Zelenskyy expressed frustration that the US envoy had “taken on the strategy of the Russian side”.Luxon and Starmer are expected to visit a military base on Wednesday to see British andNew Zealandpersonnel train Ukrainian troops as part of the UK’s Operation Interflex.More than 54,000 Ukrainians have already received training, and Luxon is expected to confirm on Tuesday that New Zealand will extend its support for the programme until the end of the year.In a further show of support for Ukraine, Starmer is expected to announce a deal worth £30m for drones produced by Syos Aerospace, a New Zealand company with a factory in Hampshire.Drones have become increasingly important over the course of the war in Ukraine, and now account for more battlefield casualties than artillery.The pair will also instruct their defence ministers to begin work on a new defence partnership between the UK and New Zealand, replacing the one signed in 2015.The UK and New Zealand have longstanding defence links. Both nations belong to the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network, and the New Zealand navy is providing a frigate, HMNZS Te Kaha, for the UK carrier strike group scheduled to set sail for the Indian Ocean from Portsmouth on Tuesday.Starmer will say: “From the beaches of Gallipoli to the vital work we have been doing together on Operation Interflex and our support for Ukraine, the UK and New Zealand have stood shoulder to shoulder for generations in pursuit of peace and stability.“As the world becomes an increasingly dangerous place, I am proud how much we are doing together to support our national and economic security – stepping up our defence spending, deploying our navies together in the Indo-Pacific, and continuing our work to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position to deter an increasingly aggressive Russia.”Explore more on these topicsDefence policyNew ZealandChristopher LuxonKeir StarmerUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

Researchers foundabout half of casescould be prevented or delayed by addressing 14 risk factors including hearing impairment, smoking, obesity, excessive alcohol consumption and social isolation – as well as high blood pressure.Now researchers say tackling the last of these could reduce the risk of dementia by 15%.“Antihypertensive treatment can prevent dementia in patients with uncontrolled hypertension,” said Prof Jiang He, the co-author of the study, from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. “Given the high prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension worldwide, this effective intervention should be widely adopted and scaled up to reduce the global burden of dementia.”Writing in the journal Nature Medicine, the researchers in China and the US reported how the trial involved 33,995 people aged 40 years and over with uncontrolled high blood pressure, spread across 326 villages in rural China.The team randomly selected 163 of these villages, with the 17,407 participants who lived there given intensive blood pressure management from non-physician community healthcare providers, often called “village doctors”.This included free or cheap medications to lower blood pressure, given at tailored doses, health coaching to help them stick to medications and lifestyle modifications – such as weight loss, alcohol reduction and reducing salt intake – and equipment and instructions to monitor blood pressure at home.The other 163 villages – encompassing 16,588 participants – received “usual care” – meaning participants’ blood pressure was managed in their normal clinical settings. While lifestyle changes were recommended and some took blood pressure-lowering drugs, this group did not receive free at-home blood pressure monitors or medications, or coaching.When the researchers followed up with the participants after four years, they found 668 of those in the intensive blood pressure management group had dementia, compared with 734 in the usual care group – with analyses suggesting the former group had a 15% lower risk of dementia. Further work revealed this group had a 16% lower risk of cognitive impairment without dementia.While the team noted that the cognitive function of participants was not assessed at the start of the study, they said the similarity of participants in the two groups means this is unlikely to skew the findings.Amid all the warnings about a ‘dementia tsunami’, here are the things you should know | Devi SridharRead moreHowever, Prof Joanna Wardlaw, of the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the work, said the study could not unpick the relative contribution of optimal blood-pressure control and lifestyle changes on the reduction in dementia risk, suggesting the results reflected a combined effect.Others said similar research should now be carried out with longer follow-up periods, and added that the approach also needed to be trialled in other countries.Prof Tara Spires-Jones, the director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, said the research “provides further strong evidence supporting the importance of managing blood pressure and other cardiovascular risks to protect the brain during ageing”.But, she added: “It is important to note that treating high blood pressure was not a foolproof guarantee as some people receiving treatment still developed dementia.”Explore more on these topicsDementiaMedical researchHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

We ask that our privacy at this difficult time be respected.”Three other men who were previously arrested in connection with the investigation have been bailed with conditions.The Independent Office for Police Conduct is continuing to investigate the circumstances prior to the collision.Staffordshire police said on Monday evening the three charged were due at a plea hearing at Stafford crown court on 23 May.Explore more on these topicsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The issue has dominated Britain’s political debate for more than a decade and played a key role inBrexit.One person who gave evidence to the review told its authors: “Nobody wants to come [and] work somewhere they’re not welcome.”During last year’s general election campaign, Rishi Sunak promised to introduce a legal cap to curb immigration levels if re-elected prime minister.“By capping migration numbers each year, we will ensure that public services are protected and housing is not overburdened, while still bringing the skills our businesses and NHS need,” the Conservative party said in June 2024.Sunak had already brought in new rules to reduce legal migration, including increasing the salary threshold for skilled worker visas.In the election itself, more than 4 million people voted for Reform UK – headed by Nigel Farage, who has saidimmigration was making parts of the UK appear “unrecognisable”and like “a foreign land”.In November last year, the prime minister, Keir Starmer, promised to slash the number of people coming to the UK, saying he would overhaul the immigration system to put the onus on organisations to train British workers.The report being studied by government officialswas compiled by experts from organisations including Cancer Research UK, the University of Southampton, and Hatch, a research consultancy. The report says politicians’ messaging on immigration is harming the UK’s ability to recruit the world’s leading professionals.This is derailing clinical trials and cancer research efforts, delaying progress in finding new ways to tackle the disease, and denying NHS patients access to life-saving drugs.Some of those affected are childrenwhose cancer has returned or treatment has stopped working.High UK visa costs are also causing a fall in top job applicants from around the world, the 54-page report obtained by the Guardian adds.Clinical trials, universities and the NHS are struggling to compete with other countries when trying to persuade the “best talent” to move to Britain, with cancer patients missing out on their expertise, it says.“Before Brexit, EU researchers didn’t have to obtain or pay for visas to work in the UK, so the EU was a large talent pool for UK research,” the report warns.“The UK’s upfront immigration costs now vastly exceed other leading research nations, so the UK is struggling to compete. EU countries can more easily attract talent from the EU due to free movement, and from non-EU countries due to their relatively low visa costs.“Non-EU countries are also attractive to global research talent due to lower comparative immigration costs than the UK.”British scientific institutions are having to spend huge sums on visa costs for cancer professionals they wish to attract and recruit.The Francis Crick Institute, one of the world’s leading biomedical research centres, is now spending more than £500,000 a year on visas for cancer scientists.CancerResearch UK institutes are spending almost £690,000 a year, up 44% from £470,000 in 2022-23.“The increasing immigration costs are taking money away from research and researchers can’t afford them, which is limiting access to global talent,” the report says.The review recommends ministers reduce “overall and upfront immigration costs” for cancer professionals and their families, and “initiate a review of the impact of the immigration system on the recruitment of international talent”.In a statement, the government said it was “enhancing collaboration” between industry, academics, the NHS and charities, adding that it was making it “easier to conduct life-saving research in medical science and technology so patients can be diagnosed earlier and offered targeted therapies”.Dr Ian Walker, an executive director of Cancer Research UK, said working with global talent was essential if the UK was to “make faster progress towards new cancer treatments and to beat this disease”.He added: “Our future health and wellbeing depends on working together internationally.”Explore more on these topicsCancer researchCancerMedical researchNHSImmigration and asylumBrexitHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

He later died in hospital.Raji’s sisters, Zainab Raji and Ruki Ware, said the anniversary of their brother’s death was “a painful reminder of 10 years of loss”. “Our family is not going to get that time back,” they said in an appeal.The independent charity Crimestoppers is offering a reward of up to £20,000 for information that leads to the identification and prosecution of those responsible for the murder.Ola Raji.Photograph: Family handout/PATheMetropolitan policesaid it was interested in speaking to witnesses, including a woman driving a black Vauxhall Corsa in the area between 21.45 and 23.00, and two men “who returned to an address in Pear Court at 23.10”.In an appeal for information, Raji’s sisters said: “When we get together, there is always that sense of something missing. There are children who never get to know their uncle, who would still be so young even now. The laughter we share is that little less loud. There is a smile absent in the photographs.“But this is not just about our family. It’s about safety on the streets of Peckham and the wider south London area. There is no doubt the people who did this once could carry out similar attacks again. Maybe they already have.“We are getting closer to the truth – for example, we now know about phone calls Ola received shortly before the attack. Just the smallest piece of evidence from any witnesses or those with knowledge of what happened could be enough to put those responsible behind bars and make the streets safer for the entire community.”The pair told MailOnline last week that they had found two new witnesses after being forced to investigate the crime themselves due to police failings.DCI Alex Gammampila, who is leading the investigation, said: “Ola was an innocent man, in the wrong place at the worst time. His murder has devastated his friends and family, and those in the local community.“Ten years on, we continue to appeal for anyone who has any information to come forward.“Were you out in Peckham that night? Were you also watching the football that night, or were you near Commercial Way? Did you see or hear the shooting or anything that struck you as being unusual?“No piece of information is too small, and could be the final piece of the puzzle that leads us to identify Ola’s attackers.”Alexa Loukas, London regional manager at Crimestoppers, said Raji’s death was “deeply unsettling for his loved ones and the local community”.Detectives are continuing to investigate the possibility that Raji’s attackers left the scene on foot, the Met said.Three individuals were arrested on suspicion of murder, and a further two individuals were arrested for perverting the course of justice but no further action was taken against them and no criminal charges were ever brought.Anyone with information should call 101, giving the reference 2597/16APR25, or upload information, including photos or videos, to thededicated appeal page.Explore more on these topicsCrimeLondonMetropolitan policePolicenewsShareReuse this content"

It was established in 1919 to help firms hit by the submarine blockade after the first world war. A century later, it mobilised to get government-backed loans and financial support to companies whose revenues were upended by supply chain disruptions during the Covid pandemic.“We’re clearly in a very changing world,” Reid, a former HSBC banker, told the Guardian.He said the near-daily shifts in US trade policy made it difficult to estimate how many UK businesses, and what proportion of their exports, could be at risk. “We don’t have that yet … is the honest answer, because we don’t know exactly where this dialogue [on tariffs] is going to progress,” he said.UK companies exporting goods to the US will face tariffs of at least 10%, while exporters of steel, aluminium and cars havebeen hit with a 25% rate.But there will also be indirect impacts, including for those companies that rely on global supply chains passing through the EU, China and the US, with suppliers raising prices on parts and raw materials to recoup higher tariffs elsewhere. The US has so far applied a 145% tariff on Chinese goods, prompting a125% retaliatory tariff by Beijing.It is unclear whether the removal of a “de-minimisexemption”, meaning shipments from China worth less than $800 (£600) will no longer enter into the US duty-free, will apply to goods shipped via the UK.Reid, who spent 34 years at HSBC before joining UKEF in 2022, said it had been easier to prepare for the fallout of the pandemic. “There was an immediate disruption to business models. That was very clear during Covid … there is still a lot of uncertainty right now in terms of the impact of this changing world.”UKEF has deployed its 25 regional agents to support at-risk businesses even while it awaits further clarity on US trade policy.Last week, UK ministers announced anextra £20bn of financing through UKEF, including state-backed loans programmes, in which the government promises to shoulder 80% of the losses if borrowers fail to repay their debts. It is meant to encourage banks to keep lending to businesses, even if tariffs make it more likely companies could default.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Reid said UKEF was pushing ahead. “We’re not waiting 90 days … we will be ready to work through this in pretty short order,” Reid said.Explore more on these topicsManufacturing sectorTrump tariffsTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

There were also 380 referrals of victims of hate crimes to their internal safeguarding hub during this period.The data, obtained using freedom of information (FoI) laws, shows that the Home Office received 11,547 reports that people in its care were victims of trafficking and 4,686 reports that they were victims of torture.Ministers have introduced a series of harsh measures against people who arrive in the UK on dinghies, such asincreasing forced removalsback to their home countries,the deprivation of British citizenship, and exploringreturningthem to France or to Balkan countries.Steve Smith, the CEO of the charity Care4Calais, said: “These statistics are appalling, but they don’t surprise me. Our local groups raise serious safeguarding concerns with the Home Office and its contractors virtually every day, but it feels like they are routinely ignored.”Separate FoI data obtained by Care4Calais reveals that, in 2024, the Home Office received a total of 1,476 of the most serious complaints from the charity Migrant Help, which has a Home Office contract to deal with asylum seekers’ problems. Migrant Help escalates only the most serious complaints. Of these, 367 related to contractor behaviour towards asylum seekers.Both sets of data are likely to be an underestimate of the true situation as many people either do not report issues for fear of damaging their asylum claims or say no action is taken when they do.Home Office sources said that in some cases there may be more than one referral made to the safeguarding hub about an individual. According toguidance on gov.uk, there is a zero-tolerance approach to harm, abuse or exploitation of any kind in asylum accommodation.An inquiry is under way by parliament’s cross-party home affairs select committee into issues surrounding asylum accommodation. More than100 pieces of evidencefrom individuals and organisations have been received and published on the inquiry’s website.In its written evidence to the committee, the British Red Cross identified “an inadequate safeguarding culture”, with many occupants feeling “physically or psychologically unsafe” in asylum accommodation.The organisation identified a catalogue of failings in asylum accommodation, including “not infrequent instances of hotel staff and housing managers in dispersal accommodation [shared housing] being sexually inappropriate and making sexualised comments to female residents”.It provided an example of one hotel where one of the asylum seekers identified “a pervasive culture of sexual harassment experienced by women and girls in the hotel, including several incidences of sexual harassment and assault”. It added that when these incidents were reported to hotel staff there was “no resolution”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One man was discharged from hospital after a suicide attempt into a windowless room that was a known trigger for his mental health condition; while a woman with mental health problems and only one arm was forced to collect water from a leaking ceiling into a bucket several times a day and struggled repeatedly to empty it because of her disability. When she complained, she was told the leak was due to the rain and would stop when the weather improved.Kamena Dorling, the director of policy at the Helen Bamber Foundation, said: “The high number of safeguarding referrals made in relation to survivors of trafficking and torture is alarming. We have long warned of the risks people face in harmful asylum accommodation, including self-harm and suicide, but little action has been taken.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “Where there are concerns about the welfare of individuals, they can be referred to the asylum safeguarding hub, which allows the Home Office and its partners to address their needs and provide relevant support. We take the welfare of those we are responsible for very seriously, and the safeguarding hub plays an important part in that.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

He would be traumatised after what he has been though, and so would we. He would be totally bewildered and upset, and would withdraw inside himself.”Kirsch, who is non-verbal and needs one-to-one care, survived a regime of abuse at his previous residential home,run by the National Autistic Society, in which he and fellow residents wererepeatedly taunted, bullied and humiliatedby a “gang of controlling male staff”.An official inquiry intothe scandal at Mendip Housepublished in 2018 found residents were slapped, had food thrown at them, were forced to eat chillies, thrown in a swimming pool and had money stolen by staff.His family said he has been living happily for the past nine years in a home supported by not-for-profit provider Somerset Care. Herzberg described it as a “forever home” for her brother where his carers were “like family”.It is understood that Somerset Care’s contract discussions with Haringey council broke down after the council repeatedly refused to increase its care fees in line with basic costs, which had been inflated by rises in the minimum wage and national insurance (NI).Haringey council confirmed it had offered a 0% fee increase for 2025-26 but insisted “no decisions” had been taken on Kirsch’s care package and that the fee increase it would apply in this case was still under review.A Haringey council spokesperson said: “We are dedicated to supporting our residents and ensuring they receive the necessary care. As part of this, we always work collaboratively with our providers to ensure a suitable and sustainable solution that prioritises the wellbeing of residents, and this case is no exception.”Do you have information about this story?

Several councils are understood to have made across-the-board 0% fee rise offers.Explore more on these topicsSocial careLondon & South EastDisabilitynewsShareReuse this content"

There’s no sentencing guidance for this,” said Prof Caroline Hunter from York Law School. “People might have a lot of issues that need to be dealt with, but they’re not dealt with by sending them to prison.”An asbi is a civil injunction used to tackle antisocial behaviour, and can be issued to anyone age 10 or over in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Breaching an injunction is not a criminal offence, but those who disobey an order are guilty of contempt of court and can be sent to prison.Civil injunctions are also used in cases involving protesters, and land disputes involving Gypsies and Travellers.Hunter, along with Rona Epstein, an honorary research fellow at Coventry law school, found that people who are destitute, homeless, have mental health issues, neurodiversity or learning disabilities were disproportionately affected.They highlighted cases such as that of Pukakdandawa Lanka, an asylum seeker not represented or present in court, who was imprisoned for 12 weeks for breaching an injunction by sleeping rough and leaving belongings in front of St Albans civic centre.They also flagged the case of Jacqueline Reilly, who was imprisoned for 18 months for repeatedly entering a YMCA building to sleep in the communal areas.One man, who breached an injunction by continuing to feed pigeons on his balcony after being instructed not to was imprisoned for 15 weeks.“I started feeding birds with my mum in the 1960s. In recent years, feeding the birds has helped with my grief, depression and ongoing sobriety. I owe them. I lost my partner, mother, brother and best friend in the space of a few years,” said Nicholas.“I tried to tell him about how feeding the birds saved me from drinking again, and helped my grief. I had a solicitor, who said that it was a mental health issue, but the judge disagreed.”The academics also raised concern about the case of Floyd Carruthers. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2003, and in April 2021 breached an asbi by banging on his neighbour’s door and damaging it. He was jailed for 66 days, and died in prison of sepsis after not eating for four days.“Many people [imprisoned] were addicted to drugs or to alcohol, or they’d been in mental health hospitals. Some of them were people who had been bereaved; one woman had lost her baby. It’s extraordinary,” said Epstein. “The whole system has been put in place to deal with behaviour that is disagreeable and a detriment to the citizen, but imprisonment belongs in the criminal code.“And there’s no public data on this, so there’s no oversight.”The analysis waspublished by the Manifesto Club, a civil liberties campaign group, which said the government’s proposed respect orders could lead to more people being unfairly imprisoned.In November, the home secretary announced that people who persistently exhibit antisocial behaviour will face up to two years in jailunder new respect orders, with police and councils handed powers to ban persistent offenders from town centres.Manifesto Club’s director, Josie Appleton, said: “Civil injunctions have led to terrible injustices, and respect orders will be even worse. These powers aren’t targeting ‘hooligans’, they are targeting those in poverty or with mental health problems, and they are being imprisoned for nothing more than going into a certain area or asking for 50p.“The criminal justice system should focus on real crimes, not pensioners feeding the birds or someone trying to find somewhere to sleep for the night.”The asbi replaced the antisocial behaviour orders (asbos) in 2010, except in Scotland. “There’s no interest [in asbis] as there was for asbos, but actually what we’re seeing is a lot going on with local authorities and social landlords using this with very little oversight,” said Hunter.Housing associations accounted for 45% of the asbis where someone was committed for sentence, while local authorities accounted for 41%.The analysis found people were imprisoned for an average of 95 days for breaches, with Gypsy and Traveller cases disproportionately more likely to receive a higher sentence – 70% of those cases were in the highest quartile for sentencing, compared with 24% of antisocial behaviour cases.The reports raised concerns about people being imprisoned even where there was no evidence of harm or inconvenience caused.A Home Office spokesperson said: “New Respect Orders will give police and councils the powers they need to clamp down on persistent antisocial behaviour and to place tough restrictions on the worst offenders.”Explore more on these topicsSocial exclusionAsbosCommunitiesUK criminal justicePrisons and probationHomelessnessLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

Drones cannot be flown “beyond visual line of sight” under current regulations, making their use for lengthy journeys impossible.In an interview with the Guardian, Lord Willetts, chair of the Regulatory Innovation Office (RIO), said the changes could come as soon as 2026, but that they would apply in “atypical” aviation environments at first, which would mean remote areas and over open water.Referring to the NHS, Willetts said there was potentially a huge market for drone operators. “It’s great for drone operators commercially, but it’s also great for services like the NHS,” he said.Drones could be used to deliver drugs to GPs and patients in remote locations, and to take blood samples to hospitals for testing, he said.The Scottish Highlands and islands could be one area of the UK to benefit, as could farming as a sector, he added. Regulatory changes could enable the use of drones under the government’s safer streets fund, which supports measures against neighbourhood crime and antisocial behaviour.“You could imagine that, for the safer streets initiative, they might be used by the police in circumstances where they might be trying to ensure public safety,” he said.Willetts also indicated that the definition of an “atypical” air environment could be broadened, which could enable greater use of drones over long distances. The definition could “cover a lot of airspace”, he said.For drones to operate in busier airspace, however, there would need to be progress on technology and standards that alert aircraft to their presence.Citing deliveries to oil rigs and the maintenance of offshore wind turbines as another example of potential use by 2026, Willetts said that “strictly speaking” using a drone to check on a turbine involved a line-of-sight requirement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Willetts said regulations had become disproportionate.The NHS already delivers urgent pathology items such as blood samples via drones as part of a trial in central London. It involves moving samples between Guy’s hospital and a lab at St Thomas’ hospital in partnership with the drone companies Apian – a UK startup co-founded by NHS doctors – and Wing, which is owned by Google’s parent company Alphabet. A similar trial has also taken place in Northumberland.The UK technology secretary, Peter Kyle, said the regulatory changes would help the UK “lead the world in new technologies”.“These are exactly the kinds of barriers we’re determined to break down through the Regulatory Innovation Office,” he said. “Cutting red tape so drones can safely deliver supplies or inspect offshore wind turbines without costly workarounds like putting someone in a boat.”Explore more on these topicsDrones (non-military)NHSnewsShareReuse this content"

From leaks of sensitive operational plans to mass firings, the dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president – who deserves better from his senior leadership,” Ullyot wrote.Pete Hegseth shared Yemen attack details in second Signal chat – reportRead moreDonald Trump Jrpushed back on the opinion piece, saying the author is “officially exiled” from Trump’s political movement. “This guy is not America First,”Trump Jr wrote on X.“I’ve been hearing for years that he works his ass off to subvert my father’s agenda. That ends today.”The warning came asthe New York Times reportedthat Hegseth shared details of a US attack on Yemeni Houthi rebels last month in a second Signal chat that he created himself and included his wife, his brother and about a dozen other people.The Guardian has independently confirmed the existence of Hegseth’s own private group chat.According to unnamed sources familiar with the chat who spoke to the Times, Hegseth sent the private group of his personal associates some of the same information, including the flight schedules for the F/A-18 Hornets that would strike Houthi rebel targets in Yemen, that he also shared with another Signal group of top officials that was created by Mike Waltz, the national security adviser.The existence of the Signal group chat created by Waltz, in whichdetailed attack plans were divulgedby Hegseth to other Trump administration officials on the private messaging app, were made public by the Atlantic magazine’s Jeffrey Goldberg, who had been accidentally added to the group.The existence of a second Signal chat, coupled with Ullyot’s devastating portrait of the Pentagon under Hegseth, is likely to increase pressure on the White House to take action.Trump defended Hegseth at the annual Easter egg roll event at the White House.“Pete’s doing a great job,” the president said. “Just ask the Houthis how he’s doing. It’s just fake news. They just bring up stories. It sounds like disgruntled employees. He was put there to get rid of a lot of bad people and that’s what he’s doing. You don’t always have friends when you do that.”Hegseth himself blamed “disgruntled former employees” in remarks to reporters at the same event.“What a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out from the same media that peddled the Russia hoax,” Hegseth said. “This is what the media does. They take anonymous sources from disgruntled former employees, and then they try to slash and burn people and ruin their reputations.”He continued: “Not going to work with me, because we’re changing the defense department, putting the Pentagon back in the hands of war-fighters. And anonymous smears from disgruntled former employees on old news doesn’t matter.”The Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, Sean Parnell, issueda statement in a post on Xon Sunday night following the New York Times report.“Another day, another old story – back from the dead,” Parnell said. “The Trump-hating media continues to be obsessed with destroying anyone committed to President Trump’s agenda. This time, the New York Times – and all other Fake News that repeat their garbage – are enthusiastically taking the grievances of disgruntled former employees as the sole sources for their article.“There was no classified information in any Signal chat, no matter how many ways they try to write the story. What is true is that the Office of the Secretary of Defense is continuing to become stronger and more efficient in executing President Trump’s agenda. We’ve already achieved so much for the American warfighter, and will never back down.”Tammy Duckworth, a Democratic senator from Illinois and combat veteran, said in a statement that the second Signal chat put the lives of US men and women in uniform at greater risk:“How many times doesPete Hegsethneed to leak classified intelligence before Donald Trump and Republicans understand that he isn’t only a f*cking liar, he is a threat to our national security?“Every day he stays in his job is another day our troops’ lives are endangered by his singular stupidity,” Duckworth said. “He must resign in disgrace.”US federal employees ‘improperly’ shared sensitive documents – reportRead moreJack Reed, a Democratic senator from Rhode Island and a senior member of the Senate armed services committee, said the report, if true, “is another troubling example of Secretary Hegseth’s reckless disregard for the laws and protocols that every other military service member is required to follow”.Reed called on Hegseth to “immediately explain why he reportedly texted classified information that could endanger American service members’ lives on a commercial app that included his wife, brother, and personal lawyer”.Reed said he had “warned that Mr Hegseth lacks the experience, competence, and character to run the Department of Defense. In light of the ongoing chaos, dysfunction, and mass firings under Mr Hegseth’s leadership, it seems that those objections were well-founded.”Ullyot warned that under Hegseth “the Pentagon focus is no longer on warfighting, but on endless drama” and said “the president deserves better than the currentmishegossat the Pentagon.”Explore more on these topicsSignal group chat leakTrump administrationPete HegsethUS militaryUS politicsUS national securitynewsShareReuse this content"

In a televised address, Saab claimed the Salvadorian’s “cynical” offer exposed him as a narcissistic “neo-Nazi” who had “kidnapped” more than 250 Venezuelan migrants sent to a maximum-security jail inEl Salvadorby the Trump administration since mid-March.“Bukele is a serial human rights violator,” Saab said, pointing to the politician’s “horrifying” three-year anti-gang crackdown, which has seen at least 85,000 Salvadoriansthrown in jail, largely without due process. Human rights activists say more than 360 prisoners have died.Some members of Venezuela’s opposition – reeling from its failure to dislodge Maduro, despite seemingly beating him in last July’s presidential election – welcomed Bukele’s offer. Leopoldo López, an exiled opposition leader who lives in Spain, said the idea had his “full support”. The opposition’s most important leader,María Corina Machado, made no immediate comment.However, many political and human rights activists have voiced perplexity and shock that the Venezuelan migrants being held in El Salvador – having been denied due process in the US and deported to an authoritarian foreign land – had become embroiled in the political tussle between strongman populists such as Trump, Bukele and Maduro.“The idea that there would be a [prisoner] trade should be loathsome to anyone who actually cares about human rights,” said Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at Chatham House.Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert from the Atlantic Council’s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, suspected the plight of the Venezuelans being held in El Salvador and Bukele’s prisoner swap “PR stunt” had potential benefits for both Bukele and Maduro.“Maduro’s quite happy to feud with Bukele and point to human rights abuses in El Salvador as a way of distracting from the brutal repression and violence of his own regime,” Ramsey said. According to the human rights group Foro Penal, Maduro’s jails currently house about 900 political prisoners. Thousands were imprisoned after last year’s election when Maduro, who has ruled since 2013, ordered acrackdownto stop his apparent victor, Edmundo González, from taking power.From Bukele’s perspective, offer was “a smart way of shifting the conversation away from concerns around the deportees being held in El Salvador back to the existence of political prisoners in Venezuela”, Ramsay said.For the migrants caught up in the geopolitical jailings, the consequences are calamitous. Many have not been convicted of any crime and it is unclear how long they will be held.‘I just ask God that he’s OK’: family of Venezuelan musician sent to El Salvador prison agonizes over his fateRead moreIn an interview last week, the wife of one Venezuelan prisoner, a singer called Arturo Suárez Trejo, lamented how the Venezuelan detainees seemed to have become part of a high-stakes game of chess. “And they are the pawns,” said Nathali Sánchez, rejecting claims that the father of her child was involved in crime. “It’s evil,” she added.The Trump administration’s targeting of Venezuelan migrants – who it has accused, largely without evidence, of being gang members and terrorists – has put Venezuela’s opposition in a difficult spot.Seemingly fearful of alienating Trump’s administration, its key leaders – including including Machado – have said little about the migration crackdown or the deportation of Venezuelan citizens to El Salvador. “[The opposition has] largely held its tongue on issues of the treatment of fellow citizens because of its larger goal of gaining the White House’s support for its preferred strategy [to defeat Maduro] and that also is reprehensible,” Sabatini said.Among the friends and families of the incarcerated migrants – many of them opposition supporters who fled Venezuela to escape Maduro’s regime – the opposition’s failure to defend them is causing anger and frustration.“The reality is that the Venezuelan opposition needs to have a good relationship with the White House, and they understand that they can’t be perceived as criticizing Trump,” said Ramsey. “But on the other hand, the general public in Venezuela is outraged at the situation faced by those who’ve been deported and sent to this maximum security jail in El Salvador. So it really puts the opposition in between a rock and a hard place.”Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaEl SalvadorDonald TrumpNicolás MaduroAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

It was the latest collaboration between rightwing US figures and McGregor, whom Donald Trumphosted at the White Houseon St Patrick’s Day.The Freemasons’ Hall, built in 1869, provided an elaborate, Victorian backdrop to the interview. In astatementat the weekend, Daley said the Freemasons routinely rented out the hall and took a booking from a US media company without initially knowing details of the event.“If the participants and content had been known the booking would not have been accepted. The Freemasons ofIrelandcategorically denies any association with the interviewer or interviewee and regrets that such an interview took place on our premises. We apologise to our members and confirm that steps have been taken to avoid a reoccurrence.”Daleytold RTÉthat the organisation learned details of the event about an hour before it took place. “When it came to my attention, I then debated with some of my colleagues. Would we cancel it or would we let it go ahead? And we decided in our wisdom that we just let it go,” he said.Daley said he allowed the interview to proceed after an assurance from Carlson’s company that all of the backgrounds would be blurred and that there would be no reference to the Freemasons’ Hall.Daley also said his organisation worried about a possible “backlash” if it cancelled the event. “In hindsight we’re not happy with that decision, I mean, look, we made a mistake, put my hands up, fully admit that.”Daley added: “I would not be a fan of Mr McGregor under any circumstances.” The fee, said to be between €1,000-€2,000, is to be donated to charity.In the interview, McGregor, said a corrupt governing elite was facilitating the “erasure” of Irish people and their identity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Over the weekend Russian troops “strictly observed” the pause in fighting, it claimed.The ceasefire expired at midnight on Monday. The announcement means the Kremlin has rejected an offer – made by Volodymyr Zelenskyy andendorsed on Sunday by the US state department– to extend the truce by 30 days.Writing on social media, Zelenskyy said Ukraine was ready for a “complete, full and honest ceasefire”. He suggested both sidesrefrain from carrying out strikes with missiles and dronesagainst civilian infrastructure.“The nature of Ukraine’s actions will remain symmetrical: ceasefire will be met with ceasefire, and Russian strikes will be met with our own in defense. Actions always speak louder than words,” he posted on X.In his nightly video address, Zelenskyy later said: “Ukraine maintains its proposal not to strike at least civilian infrastructure. And we expect a clear answer from Moscow. We are ready for any conversation on how to ensure this.”Putin said Moscow would consider the Ukrainian ceasefire proposal, but accused Kyiv of using civilian sites for military purposes.“We will analyse everything and take the corresponding decisions,” he told state reporters in Moscow.Moscow appears to be deliberately stalling the peace talks, betting that continued battlefield gains will bolster its position and enable it to demand greater concessions at the negotiating table.Zelenskyy saidRussiahad launched numerous attacks using artillery and drones, as well as infantry. The most active part of the Easter frontline was near the city of Pokrovsk, in the eastern Donetsk region, he said.Enemy forces continued combat operations in Russia’s Kursk region, he added, where Ukrainian units hold a small amount of territory. Russia has claimed Ukraine broke the ceasefire.Ukrainian soldiers said their sectors had come under sustained Russian fire. They added that Russian troops used the pause to repair damaged logistical crossings and to prepare for new offensive operations.“For us, it’s just another day of war, with shelling from various types of weapons and an even one attempt to assault our positions,” Denys Bobkov, from the 37th separate marine brigade said on Sunday.Putin addressed Russia’s missile strike on the eastern Ukrainian city of Sumy, where 35 people, including two children, were killed, for the first time on Monday. He acknowledged that Moscow had hit civilian infrastructure but claimed the site was being used for military purposes. The twin strikes on Sumy were the deadliest incident this year in Russia’s war against Ukraine.The Kremlin’s apparent position is that the White House will not take any punitive measures against it. Since returning to office in January, Donald Trump hasdemanded concessionsfrom Kyiv while putting no similar pressure on Moscow.Trump hasdescribed Zelenskyy as a dictatorand has blamed him for starting the war alongside Joe Biden. Last week Trump played downa devastating Russian missile strikeon the Ukrainian city of Sumy – in which 35 people were killed – calling it “a mistake”.Leaks suggest the Trump administration is now pushing for a “peace deal” that heavily favours Russia. The deal would include a pause to the conflict along the existing 1,000km frontline, recognition that Crimea belongs to Moscow, and a veto on Ukraine’s Nato membership.There are also unconfirmed reports that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station – which Russia seized in 2022 – would be part of a “neutral” zone. Talks on a possible peace settlement featuring US envoys are due to take place later this week in London.Speaking on Monday, Putin’s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, welcomed the US’s sympathetic stance. Russia has also called for Zelenskyy’s removal and Ukraine’s “demilitarisation”.“We have heard from Washington at various levels that Ukraine’s membership in Nato is excluded. Of course, this is something that causes our satisfaction and coincides with our position,” Peskov said.After a brief period of relative calm over the weekend, Russia resumed its aerial bombardment of Ukrainian cities and towns. Ukraine’s air force said 96 drones and three missiles were launched overnight at central and eastern regions.There wereair raid alertsacross much of the country. In Kherson, three people were killed and three injured in Russian attacks, the region’s governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported in a post on Telegram. A residential area and a store were hit, he said.Among those killed in the Kherson region was a woman who was struck by a drone while walking down the street, according to Gyunduz Mamedov, a former deputy prosecutor general of Ukraine. Four people were wounded in strikes in Donetsk.Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineEuropeVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyShareReuse this content"

The lawmakers are seeking to meet with Ábrego García, who had lived in the US for more than a decade before being swept up in a 15 March operation.“Even with all of the illegal actions we’ve seen over the last couple of months, I think this is the one that terrifies me the most when it comes to the future of our democracy,” Ansari told the Associated Press in an interview.Senator says trip to El Salvador was to support Kilmar Ábrego García’s due processRead moreAccording to a congressional aide familiar with the arrangements, the delegation will meet with officials at the US embassy on Tuesday morning to advocate for Ábrego García’s release and ask about other individuals transferred from the US who are currently detained inEl Salvador. The lawmakers will also receive classified briefings during their visit.The case has become a flashpoint in the ongoing tensions between theTrump administrationand the supreme court, which ruled that the government had a duty to help return Ábrego García. Justice department lawyers have argued that they lack the power to secure his release from foreign custody.Garcia, the representative fromCalifornia, said that Ábrego García deserved due process.“They’re trying to demonize him, and we’re not here to defend him. He deserves due process, and everyone deserves due process,” Garcia told the AP. “What he did or may have done, that has to be decided by a judge.”Ábrego García, who had protected legal status that should have prevented his deportation, was sent to El Salvador on a plane carrying alleged immigrant gang members. He is currently being held in a prison in El Salvador after being moved from the country’s Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot), which has drawn praise from Republican lawmakers but criticism from human rights advocates for inhumane conditions.The Trump administration admitted in court filings that “an administrative error” led to Ábrego García’s deportation to El Salvador – despite a 2019 immigration judge’s order protecting him – but the same officials say they will not return him to his American wife and disabled child in Maryland.The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt has defended the deportation, claiming Ábrego García was involved in human trafficking and terrorism, and said that if he were to return to the US, “he would immediately be deported again”.But the controversy has even drawn criticism from some Republicans, with Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana acknowledging on NBC’s Meet the Press that “the administration won’t admit it. But this was a screw-up.”As minority party members in both chambers of Congress,Democratshave limited leverage over the administration but are still determined on maintaining public pressure. Ansari indicated that more Democratic lawmakers plan to visit El Salvador in the coming weeks, saying: “This is about the future of our democracy and the future of due process as American citizens.”Ábrego GarcÍa’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, said in a statement on Monday that the lawmakers’ visit “sends a powerful message”.“We’re deeply grateful to the members of Congress and advocates for justice now on the ground in El Salvador, building on the leadership of Senator Van Hollen,” she said in the statement, according to NBC News.During a news conference from El Salvador on Monday afternoon, Frost told reporters that “due process applies to all people in our country”.“We demand the release of Ábrego García,” Frost said. “We’re also worried about our own constituents.”Frost added that the representatives had requested to see Ábrego García on Monday but that the request was denied by the Salvadorian government as it was not an official trip.Ansari added that the delegation met with the US embassy in El Salvador on Monday morning, and that they didn’t hear anything that gave her reason “to believe that the Trump administration is doing anything to facilitate his safe return home”.Kilmar Ábrego García ‘traumatized’ by threats in prison, Maryland senator saysRead more“And that is simply unacceptable,” she said, noting that they had just sent a letter to the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, “demanding daily proof of life” from Ábrego García, that he has access to counsel, and that the administration return him to the US.Ansari said that this “isn’t just about Kilmar, it is the fact that our government is relentlessly going after any immigrants trying to come to the US, or in in US, without any regard for due process”.“They have not been convicted of a crime, they should not be imprisoned here,” she said.This article was amended on 21 April 2025 to say that Kilmar Ábrego García is now being held in a Salvadorian prison and no longer in Cecot.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsEl SalvadorTrump administrationDemocratsArizonaOregonFloridanewsShareReuse this content"

The other would require patients to get an ultrasound before a medication abortion.Wyoming Health Access in Casper hadstopped providing abortionson 28 February, the day after the Republican governor, Mark Gordon, signed the licensing requirement into effect.The result: at least some people seeking abortions had totravel out of state. Now, people will once again be able to get abortions in central Wyoming while the two laws continue to be contested in court, Wellspring Health Access’s founder and president, Julie Burkhart, said on Monday.“We are immediately shouting it from the rooftop to make sure our patients know,” Burkhart said following the ruling. “We are back to seeing patients the way we were on February 27.”An abortion opponent questioned the need to contest the laws if the clinic was safe.Fate of Wyoming’s last abortion clinic in balance as Republicans take aimRead more“The abortion business here in Casper could prove that they are providing safe services by complying with laws. Would that not make their point?” Ross Schriftman, the president of Natrona county Right to Life, said in an email statement on Monday.Abortion has remained legal in Wyoming despite bans passed since 2022. The bans include the nation’sfirst explicit ban on abortion pills.A judge in Jackson blocked the bansthen struck them down in Novemberon the grounds that abortion is allowed by a 2012 state constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right of competent adults to make their own healthcare decisions.TheWyomingsupreme court heard arguments in that case on Wednesday and is unlikely to rule for at least several weeks.Meanwhile, the same people challenging the bans – WellspringHealthAccess, the abortion access advocacy group Chelsea’s Fund, and four women, including two obstetricians – have sued to block Wyoming’s most recent two abortion laws.The surgical center licensing requirement would require costly renovations to make Wellspring Health Access compliant, the clinic said in its lawsuit.Gordonvetoed the requirementfor an ultrasound at least 48 hours before a pill abortion, calling it onerous in cases of abuse, rape or when a person’s health is at risk. State lawmakers voted to override the veto on 5 March.The ultrasound requirement did not significantly affect clinic operations but Wellspring Health Access also suspended offering pill abortions to avoid legal complications. The law stands to add to the cost and complications for patients getting pill abortions.Opponents call laws like Wyoming’s requirements “targeted restrictions on abortion providers” because they can regulate clinics and abortion access out of existence even if abortion remains legal.In blocking the laws while the lawsuit proceeds, district judge Thomas Campbell in Casper ruled that they too stand to violate the constitution.Despite the new restrictions, Wellspring Health Access has remained open to consult with patients and provide hormone replacement therapy for transgender patients. The clinic opened in 2023, almost a year late after heavy damage from anarson attack.Explore more on these topicsWyomingAbortionRoe v WadeLaw (US)HealthUS healthcareWomennewsShareReuse this content"

On Monday, Bar submitted an 31-page affidavit to the supreme court, which halted his firing last month. The affidavit detailed his version of the events that led to the breakdown of his relationship with Netanyahu and his dismissal. Some sections relating to national security were kept classified.Among the most serious allegations made in Bar’s affidavit was the claim that “on several occasions” Netanyahu explicitly told Shin Bet to conduct surveillance on citizens involved in anti-government protests, which he refused to do. Bar said the prime minister demanded the agency “provide details regarding the identities of Israeli citizens, protest activists” involved in any demonstrations against the Netanyahu government, and monitor those deemed to be “protest funders”.Who is Ronen Bar, the sacked chief of Israel’s Shin Bet security service?Read moreBar also alleged that Netanyahu had made clear to him that in a constitutional crisis, his loyalty must be to the prime minister and not the high court of justice. He also said “an effort was made to coerce me” to sign a document that would have helped Netanyahu avoid publicly testifying in court in a corruption case against him, which Bar pushed back on.Bar alleged that Netanyahu would voice these demands at the ends of meetings, away from any official documentation. “It was clearly intended to prevent any record of the conversation,” said Bar.“To this day, the reason for my firing is not clear to me,” he wrote in the affidavit. “But, the developments that took place over the last few months indicate one thing: at some point late last year, the decision to fire me was consolidated. It was not rooted in any professional metric, but out of an expectation by Netanyahu that I would be personally loyal to him.”In the buildup to Monday’s submission to the courts, it was reported Bar had been put under immense pressure by Netanyahu’s government not to submit his affidavit. He had initially been due to submit it on Sunday, but requested an extra day. It was also leaked to Israeli media that Bar intended to resign in mid-May, which was immediately denied by Shin Bet.Netanyahu’s office hit back instantly at Bar’s allegations, calling them “a complete lie” and saying the “false affidavit” would be refuted. The government has until Thursday to submit its response to the courts. Netanyahu has said he had lost all trust in Bar’s capacity to lead Shin Bet and accused him of a conflict of interest and politicising the agency.Yair Lapid, the leader of the political opposition, said that Bar’s affidavit “proves that Netanyahu is a danger to Israeli security and cannot continue to serve as prime minister.”The relationship between Bar and Netanyahu had become increasingly acrimonious after the 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas militants in southern Israel. In a report on the events, Shin Bet admitted the agency’s own failures but also criticised policies of the Netanyahu government that it said had enabled a buildup of Hamas in Gaza.Netanyahu has never accepted any responsibility for Israel’s worst national security disaster, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and led to 251 being abducted and held hostage in Gaza.Bar’s authorisation for Shin Bet to open two investigations into Netanyahu’s close aides, including one forallegedly taking payments from Qatar to promote its interests in Israel, at the same time that Qatar was partly financing Hamas in Gaza, was said to only strengthen the prime minister’s animosity. With Netanyahu already facing a multitude of corruption charges in court, political opponents have alleged he wanted to remove Bar in order to sabotage the investigations.Is Qatargate a scandal too far even for Benjamin Netanyahu?Read moreIn his affidavit, Bar stood by the actions taken by Shin Bet. “The incitement that has accompanied the investigations, against me and all those tasked with protecting state secrets, demonstrates the connection between the investigations and the timing of my dismissal,” he said.On Sunday night, Shlomo Karhi, a minister in Netanyahu’s Likud party, told Israeli media that the courts should not be interfering with the cabinet decision to dismiss Bar. “Those who talk about the high court of justice, how it’s the be-all and end-all, what is democratic about that?” he said.In a press conference, Lapid condemned the direct threats of violence that Bar was facing for standing up to the Netanyahu government. “The level of incitement and insanity are without precedent,” he said. “The red line has been crossed. If we don’t stop this, there will be a political assassination, possibly more than one. Jews will kill Jews.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warQatarnewsShareReuse this content"

It followed the arrival in the US on Sunday of another 737 Maxpainted in the livery of China’s Xiamen Airlinesat Boeing’s US production hub in Seattle.Boeing’s share price fell by nearly 3% on Monday, in line with a sell-off across Wall Street. US stock markets have been hit with much higher volatility this month as investors have tried to work out the effects of Trump’s tariffs.The aviation industry has been caught up in the trade war. Trump’s tariffs on goods from almost all countries have caused disruption across the world, but trade in goods between the US and China has been most affected, with levies of 145% on US imports and125% on goods going the other way.A new 737 Max has a market value of about $55m (£41.4m), according to IBA, an aviation consultancy. That makes a 125% tariff prohibitive without significantly changing the business model of the airline business.The return of the Boeing jets underlines the vulnerability to tariffs of the US’s biggest manufacturing exporter. It adds to Boeing’s problems just as it was trying to recover from a mid-air door panel blowout in January 2024 that prompted the company to replace its chief executive.Kelly Ortberg, whotook over Boeing after the safety crisis, will reveal the company’s first-quarter financial results on Wednesday. Analysts expect a significant improvement in sales compared with a year earlier, with revenues forecast to have risen 20% to $19.8bn, although they still expect losses of $466m for the quarter.However, the results are likely to be overshadowed by questions over the effect of tariffs on the business.Douglas Harned, an analyst at Bernstein, a research company, said he did not expect “definitive answers” on the tariff hit but was “concerned that risks are larger than expected” given airlines’ discomfort with paying tariffs, and possible delays to production to try to avoid levies.Harned said the pause on Chinese deliveries could hit cash generation in 2025, although he added that he expected the planes to be delivered eventually.Yet investors are having to contend with huge uncertainty over the White House’s intentions. Trump’s current policy is to raise tariffs on many countries after the end of a90-day “pause” on higher rates that excluded China, announced by the US president after market turmoil spread to the bond market.Richard Aboulafia, the managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, a consultancy, said theTrump administrationhad showed a “profound and hard-earned level of ignorance” of how the aerospace industry works, and that long-term tariffs would be damaging for Boeing.Aboulafia said the short-term hit to Boeing’s cash should be relatively limited but added that the company should push back hard against Trump’s tariffs, particularly to avoid a “catastrophic trade war with the rest of the world”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Chinese airlines are expected to account for as much as a fifth of new aircraft sales in one of the key markets for Boeing and its European rival Airbus. “You can’t just leave that to Airbus,” Aboulafia said.In a sign that the trade war could intensify beyond the US-China relationship, on Monday, Beijing warned it wouldtake “resolute and reciprocal” countermeasuresagainst other countries negotiating with the US if they made a deal at China’s expense.However, the rest of the world’s aviation industry may be less likely to be affected by countermeasures, given China’s reliance on US and European planes.Reuters reported that the 737 Max 8 landed in the US territory of Guam on Monday, after leaving Boeing’s Zhoushan completion centre near Shanghai, data from the flight-tracking website AirNav Radar showed.A spokesperson for Xiamen Airlines on Monday confirmed to Reuters that two planes marked for the carrier had gone to the US but declined to provide a reason.Boeing was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsBoeingTrump tariffsAerospace industryChinaAirline industryDonald TrumpTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

Please do not read unless you have seen the first two episodes.Brutal. How else could you describe that ending? Not only does a foundational character get tortured and killed, but the other most beloved character is forced to witness their final harrowing moments. In an episode ofThe Last of Usthat ramped up the post-apocalyptic action to unseen levels – with a full-scale assault by a berserk horde of infected – the most intense scenes took place on the chilly, blood-spattered floor of a remote Wyoming ski lodge.You could also call that ending brave, or even foolish. The fraught but loving relationship between fallible father figure Joel (Pedro Pascal) and his spiky surrogate daughter Ellie (Bella Ramsey) was the beating heart of season one. By killing off Joel in such a savage fashion, and further traumatising Ellie, you surely risk pushing the story too far into bleakness. That may become clearer in the weeks ahead. First, let’s break down how we got to the point whereThe Last of Uschanged.The morning afterView image in fullscreenVengeful … Kaitlyn Dever as Abby.Photograph: HBOAn opening dream sequence serves as a reminder of why Abby (Kaitlyn Dever) is so vengeful. She relives the death of her father, the doctor Joel shot who was poised to operate on (and, in the process, kill) Ellie five years ago in Salt Lake City. We also get to spend a little more time with the group that agreed to help Abby on her revenge quest: Owen (Spencer Lord), Nora (Tati Gabrielle), Manny (Danny Ramirez) and Mel (Ariela Barer). From their ski lodge eyrie, they can see that Joel’s settlement of Jackson Hole is more fortified than they first thought. Perhaps understandably, considering Abby’s tense mood, they don’t seem to have celebrated New Year’s Eve with a big boozy blowout.Down in Jackson Hole it is a different story, with hangovers rife. Ellie is in the process of being dragged out on patrol with the likable Jesse (Young Mazino), who mentions that a recent scouting party disturbed a buried mob of infected and no one knows for sure how many might be out there. To add to the ominous foreshadowing, Ellie tells Jesse that while her relationship with Joel may be complicated, it is built on an unshakeable foundation: “I’m still me, he’s still Joel, and nothing’s ever going to change that, ever.” At a hastily convened town meeting, Tommy (Gabriel Luna) runs through the emergency protocols if the town is attacked, which seem to boil down to “shelter underground or get up on a roof”. We’ll see how effective those plans might be shortly.A storm brewingView image in fullscreenLured to the lodge … Joel and Isabela Merced as Dina.Photograph: HBODark clouds are gathering on the horizon but Joel is already out on horseback patrol with Ellie’s crush Dina (Isabela Merced). If the pair are awkwardly discussing thedancefloor ruckus at the party the night beforewe don’t get to hear it: we only see them at range through Abby’s binoculars. Her hurried attempts to intercept them lead her down a slippery slope into a frozen field of infected. But soon the agitated horde – most of whom seem to have been preserved in the early stages of cordyceps infection – begins scrambling out of the slush to snack on Abby. After a claustrophobic crawl alongside a wire fence buckling under the weight of a hungry mob, she is set to be mauled when an unexpected saviour appears: Joel. Presumably he must have questions about this young woman who emerged from the snowstorm. But his admirable first instinct is to bundle her into the temporary refuge of a copper mine.Roasted mushrooms, anyone?View image in fullscreenFighting back … Gabriel Luna as Tommy.Photograph: HBONow that a gigantic avalanche of infected is active they home in on a new target: Jackson Hole itself (led by the twitching cordyceps tendrils that have choked some of the settlement’s plumbing). As waves of infected smash against the stout wooden walls, Tommy leads the fightback by launching barrels of oil into the horde to create an impromptu moat of fire, apparently one of the most effective ways of putting down a mushroom-infested enemy. But the infected are now smart enough to seek out a weak point in the town’s defences, and before long a big boy bloater – last seencausing havoc back in episode five– has smashed through the wall.With the infected rampaging down Main Street, it is absolute chaos. Tommy, now strapped up with a flamethrower, desperately tries to repel the horde, but the town seems close to being overrun. But when he sees the oversized bloater make a beeline for his wife Maria (Rutina Wesley) – just how intelligent have the infected become? – Tommy goes all out to lure it away, coming dangerously close to death in the process. Then Maria sets the town’s hunting dogs free, and their throat-ripping counter-attack seem to turn the tide of battle. Phew.A bloody reckoningView image in fullscreenRescue attempt … Bella Ramsey as Ellie.Photograph: HBOAfter using their horses to outrun a mob of infected, Abby has lured Joel and Dina to the ski lodge under the pretext of getting help before joining the fight at Jackson Hole. But when her friends realise Joel has been delivered right to them, the temperature in the room changes palpably. The frostbitten Dina is given a knockout shot by Mel so she doesn’t have to see what happens next.Abby, unmoved by the fact Joel just saved her, shotguns Joel in the knee and reminds him of his death tally back in Salt Lake City: 18 soldiers and one doctor. That Abby has nursed and rehearsed this revenge fantasy for years is clear from her scarily methodical approach. But while she is monologuing, Joel gets in one last act of defiance: “Oh, just shut the fuck up and do it already.” Then she starts beating him with a golf iron.It is bloodthirsty stuff, made all the more upsetting when Ellie bursts in for a last-ditch rescue attempt. Even if Abby’s friends don’t seem thrilled by what’s happening, they are loyal enough to restrain Ellie so she – and we – are forced to see the climactic death blow from floor-level, helpless to do anything about it. After that, it feels as if the invaders cannot wait to bug out, obviously queasy about what their leader has done. They also leave Ellie alive, which might seem a tactical error. But while she swears her own revenge, the lasting image is of Ellie dragging herself over to Joel’s body for one final hug. She was born after the initial outbreak and has grown up immune. But now Ellie knows what it feels like for your world to end. What on earth happens next?Notes and observations“I knew I was going to die before they offered me the part …” Pedro Pascal, flanked by Bella Ramsey and Kaitlyn Dever, breaks down his pivotal scene in this fascinating (and surprisingly fun)Entertainment Weekly debrief video.While Ellie and Jesse are sheltering from the storm we hear more about the late weed cultivator Eugene, who Joel apparently had to “put down” a year ago: he was a Vietnam vet who left the Fireflies because he was “tired of killing people”.This episode was directed by Mark Mylod, veteran of Game of Thrones and Succession (where he oversaw anothermajor character death). His next project isHBO’s Harry Potter TV reboot.Through the Valley, the acoustic ballad that gave this episode its title and played out over the closing montage, was sung by Ashley Johnson. She provided the voice and motion-capture for Ellie in the video games – and also played Ellie’s mum, Anna, in akey flashback last season.What did you think? Were you ready to say goodbye to Joel?

But while all eyes were on the potential ramifications of villain Galactus turning up for planetary snack time,the new trailer for The Fantastic Four: First Stepsdelivers a mind-bending revelation: Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby) is pregnant.This looks like big news. As they prepare to take on their colossal nemesis and his gleaming, emotionally unavailable emissary Silver Surfer (Julia Garner), Pedro Pascal’s Reed Richards, Joseph Quinn’s Johnny Storm and Ebon Moss-Bachrach’s the Thing will be doing so in the knowledge that they’re protecting more than just the future of this Apollo-era-inspired version of Earth. And if you’ve even lightly skimmed the back catalogue of Fantastic Four comics, you’ll know this is no ordinary pregnancy; and certainly no ordinary infant.In its print incarnation, the first child of Storm and Richards grows up to become Franklin Richards, a superhero so powerful he once daydreamed an entire pocket universe into existence during a sugar crash.View image in fullscreenNo ordinary pregnancy … Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm/Invisible Woman in The Fantastic Four: First Steps.Photograph: Marvel StudiosImagine Jack-Jack from The Incredibles if he could rewrite the laws of physics every time someone told him it was bedtime, and you’re starting to get the idea. At one point, Reed had to zap his own son with a psychic dampening device to stop Franklin from unconsciously folding the fabric of reality into an origami swan out of existential despair. We’re talking teething problems if “teething” includes accidentally erasing causality because nap time was five minutes late.How this affects the plotline of First Steps is yet to be seen, and it’s still possible Franklin will remain a foetus throughout the events of Matt Shakman’s film. But there’s every chance that the arrival of this almost impossibly overcooked character is the very thing that’s brought Galactus to Earth.We still don’t know how theFantastic Fourwill end up in the main Marvel reality by the time Avengers: Doomsday hits cinemas next year, or even whether the new Robert Downey Jr-essayed version of Doctor Doom hails from the same timeline as Richards et al. But already the blogosphere is buzzing with theories that Franklin will ultimately be responsible for a soft Marvel reboot, one that prunes the dead weight from the MCU and maybe restores Iron Man, Black Widow and T’Chaka to the main continuity.In the comics, the Fantastic Four were the first modernMarvelsuperheroes, debuting in 1961 when Spider-Man, the X-Men and The Hulk were all still twinkles in the eyes of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. So it makes absolute sense for the studio to introduce them in a world where no other capes exist just yet.What we don’t yet understand is why this particular Earth has caught the attention of a planet-eating space god in a hat the size of a football stadium. But if it’s not Franklin Richards popping into reality, then the movie’s title, Marvel’s relentless teasing of Storm’s pregnancy, and that brooding snapshot of an empty crib are going to go down as the greatest misdirect in comic book movie history.Is that Galactus himself stomping around at the end of the trailer in size 40,000 boots, striding through this Jetsons-inspired take on Manhattan? If so, it seems Marvel may have rather downsized the supervillain – a cosmic behemoth canonically capable of munching on entire solar systems. Then again, the celestial gutbucket has walked the surface of the Earth in the comics before, and at least Hollywood isn’t rendering him here as agiant cosmic fart lurking menacingly in the clouds.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekSuperhero moviesMarvelFantastic FourComics and graphic novelsPedro PascalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A new series aims to do justice to his story – and those who fought to clear his nameMon 21 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Apr 2025 12.51 EDTShareOn 22 July 2005, 27-year-oldJean Charles de Menezeswas shot and killed by firearms officers on the London underground shortly after boarding a train. The information relayed by the Metropolitan police at the time was that he had leapt over the ticket barriers at Stockwell station and was wearing a bulky coat under which officers thought he was hiding a bomb.The incident occurred two weeks after the 7/7 bombings on London’s transport network, where 52 people were killed, and the day after a copycat attack in which four men tried – and mercifully failed – to detonate devices on three underground trains and a bus; the bombers in the latter incidents fled the scene, triggering a police manhunt. It later emerged that De Menezes was innocent and the intelligence on him was flawed. But such was the impact of that early narrative – the one where his actions and appearance made him seem guilty at a time when police were on high alert – that, 20 years on, it is still what most people remember.It’s certainly what screenwriterJeff Pope(Philomena, Stan & Ollie) recalled when he was first approached about writing the drama series Suspect: The Shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes. “My subconscious memory was that it was a terrible accident, where Jean Charles had unwittingly been the architect of his own downfall, because he had vaulted the barrier and run down the escalator. And when the firearms officers got on the train, he challenged them and it all ended in horror.” But then Pope did some digging, reading the twoIndependent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) reports, the inquest transcript plus the 2007 health and safety at work prosecution, where a jury found the Met police had breached health and safety rules and put the public at risk. From these, he gleaned that De Menezes had in fact walked into the station, picked up a newspaper and got on the train without incident. “I was certain by the time I had absorbed the research that this was a poorly planned and poorly executed operation that morning.”View image in fullscreenRussell Tovey as Brian Paddick in Suspect: The Shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes.Photograph: Des Willie/Disney+A tense and frequently shocking ensemble piece written by Pope and directed by Paul Andrew Williams, Suspect details the before, during and after of the shooting, laying out the events that led to the misidentification of De Menezes, the shooting in the train carriage and the ensuing prevarications and inconsistencies from police. We see De Menezes, played by newcomer Edison Alcaide, in the days before his death, working two jobs – an electrician by day, he washed dishes in a restaurant at night – and talking to his mother back in Brazil who frets about her son living in a city where bombers are targeting civilians. We also meet the Met’s top brass including commissioner Ian Blair (Conleth Hill), who rushes out public statements before he has all the facts; Cressida Dick (Emily Mortimer), gold commander of the surveillance operation that led to De Menezes’s shooting; and deputy assistant commissioner, Brian Paddick (played by Russell Tovey), who is appalled at the circulating half-truths and smears on De Menezes’ character.“It’s like we’re saying: ‘Sorry we killed you, but it is your own fault,’” he remarks to another officer.‘Filming the shooting was heavy – none of us wanted to avoid the reality of what happened’Before taking the role, Tovey already knew Paddick, having met him through Stonewall and Terrence Higgins Trust events. “I’ve always found him a bit of a hero figure as an out gay man who had got to that position within the Met while being vocal about LGBTQI+ rights,” he says. “To be able to hang out with him and pick his brains for this was a wonderful situation to be in.” In the aftermath of the shooting, a question mark hung over exactly when senior officers knew the wrong man had been shot, and whether they released deliberately misleading information about De Menezes, knowing he was innocent. Paddick gave evidence that contradicted statements made by Blair – the implication being that Blair had lied. This ultimately led to Paddick being sidelined at the Met and leaving his job.“So you see what sticking your neck on the line and making sure the truth is upheld does to someone’s career,” says Tovey.View image in fullscreenEdison Alcaide as Jean Charles de Menezes in Suspect: The Shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes.Photograph: Stefania Rosini/Disney+In the drama, there is an impossibly tense standoff between Paddick and Blair, with Paddick politely asserting his version of the timeline and Blair calmly and repeatedly telling his deputy he is mistaken. “You must do what you have to do,” says Blair, “but we both know the penalty for not telling the truth.” “That’s where good drama comes in,” says Game of Thrones starConleth Hill, who plays Blair. “Nobody knows what happened in those meetings apart from the two of them. But [as an actor] you can’t torture yourself about that when you’ve got a good script in front of you.” Though Blair emerges from the story as slippery and over concerned about reputation, Hill says he is sympathetic to the pressure he was under “during all this panic” and was never going to play him as an out-and-out villain. “The responsibility is to tellthestory, not his story. My father was a news cameraman during the worst of the Troubles and I always admired his unbiased presentation, no matter what he felt himself.”Fatal error: 20 years on, the Met still has questions to answer about the killing of Jean Charles de Menezes. A new drama investigates the tragedyRead moreWhile making Suspect, Pope was in close contact with the DeMenezes family, who he says wanted Jean Charles’s story to be told accurately, and the misconceptions about him to be corrected. This was a responsibility keenly felt by Brazilian actor Edison Alcaide in playing De Menezes. “As a story, it hits close to home,” he says. He knew little of the shooting until he moved to London from Brazil in 2008 where his first home happened to be in Stockwell. “I remember seeing the memorial [containing a mosaic image of De Menezes] outside the tube – that was my first contact with Jean Charles – and thinking: ‘What is this about?’ And of course, the first thing I heard was: ‘Oh, he reacted to the police. He ran away.’”The most shocking scenes in Suspect arrive in the chaos of the shooting – De Menezes was shot at close range seven times in the head – and the blood-soaked stillness that follows. “They were heavy days,” says Alcaide of the filming, noting that the cast and crew wanted “to make the story as truthful as possible. None of us wanted to avoid the tough reality of what happened.” Pope adds: “We thought long and hard about it; we wanted to show exactly what happened, how violent his death was. Seven shots to the head: that actually takes a long time. [Jean Charles’s mother] Maria said to us afterwards: ‘I watched it, and I’m glad I saw it. I’ll never watch it again.’”View image in fullscreenConleth Hill as Ian Blair in Suspect: The Shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes.Photograph: Matthias Clamer/Disney+There is another quietly heroic figure who is often overlooked in accounts of the Menezes case: Lana Vandenberghe, a Canadian secretary and whistleblower at the IPCC who observed with dismay the disconnect between what the public were being told and the evidence being collected by her organisation. And so she photocopied the evidence, put it in a folder and gave it to a journalist at ITN – a decision that cost her her job. In Suspect, she is played by Laura Aikman, who knew nothing of this part of the story. But Pope and producer Kwadjo Dajan had interviewed Vandenberghe as part of their research “and they pretty much asked everything I would want to ask her”, Aikman says. “So I had snippets of that interview saved on my phone. [What was clear] was that she was really scared … because she knew what the consequences could be for her.”Police later raided Vandenberghe’s flat and took her in for questioning. While she was in custody, interviewing officers threatened to charge her with stealing ink and paper. “Ink and paper!” exclaims Pope. “These are gifts to a writer. You can see how desperate they were to land a glove on Lana. They could have put out a statement and talked about breach of trust, or that she was working in confidence. But to try and charge her with criminal theft, it’s pathetic.”If there is an overarching theme in Suspect, beyond the horrific injustice of the killing of De Menezes, it is the long-term impact of misinformation. “In theworld we live in now,” reflects Pope, “there are so many grabs on the truth, so I think that makes this piece really relevant.”Tovey agrees: “The truth doesn’t matter any more … so we have to make these shows because art can educate and bring about change.” He points to the conversations around young men in the wake of Netflix’s hit drama Adolescence. “If you dramatise something, it brings it into existence in a way that no other medium really can. We need these series to tell us who we are and to hold people accountable.”Suspect: The Shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes is on Disney+ from30 April.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionDramaJean Charles de MenezesRussell ToveyConleth HillEmily MortimerJeff PopefeaturesShareReuse this content"

ACE is charged with distributing public and lottery funds to arts organisations in England.Henley said: “I observe the London-centricity in our media. I go around the country, and the people who lead in those places don’t get the half-page columns in our national newspapers as easily as the people who are London based.“There’s a power dynamic there … there’s a sort of imbalance. Maybe the role I have to play when I’m sitting in the corridors of power in London is to be representative of all those places who don’t have a seat at that table.”His comments come after several high-profile London-based arts leaders heavily criticised ACE after the classical venue Wigmore Hall announced that from 2026 it wouldno longer take public subsidies.Instead the venue has secured £10m in pledged donations, with John Gilhooly, the artistic and executive director ofWigmore Hall, saying he was grateful for ACE’s support, but adding that “it has lost its way”.Henley said: “I absolutely respect people who have a view that says we’re doing something that isn’t for their liking or their taste. That’s perfectly reasonable for a public body to be challenged that way … but there are lots and lots of people who I meet who say something different.“You’ve got a lot of groups who are very passionate about all the things we do and maybe negative voices shout louder than positive voices.”The former Classic FM boss said that ACE was “not waging war on classical” after the Wigmore Hall withdrawal and criticism from several figures in the sector. One high-profile broadside came from the former English National Opera artistic director David Pountney, who said ACE “had it in” for opera.Henley said: “It’s really important that we have world class opera at the Royal Ballet here in London, in our capital city that is as good or better artistically as anywhere else in the world. It’s really important. But I also think it’s equally as important that we have a network of grassroots live music venues in towns across this country.”Henley also dismissed suggestions from former National Theatre artistic director Nicholas Hytner, who argued that ACE funding should follow a UK Sport model and pursue “excellence”.Henley said: “UK Sport is absolutely ruthless about winning gold medals, and if you are one of the sports teams that suddenly does well and wins lots of gold medals, you get more funding next time. If you don’t do well, you get less funding. So under his model, if the RSC had an amazing run and the National Theatre had a not-so-good run, money would be taken away from the National Theatre and given to the RSC.“I think that is not really what he’s actually arguing … I think there’s a little bit of misunderstanding there.”The government has ordereda review of ACE, which distributes more than £500m of public money and more than £250m of national lottery money annually, and employs more than 650 people.Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, said the review would be the first step to restore “people’s connection with the arts and culture in every region of the country”.Explore more on these topicsArts Council EnglandLondonArts fundingEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The Creed franchise tarries in the space between Black athletic genius and fatherlessness. The Black Panther franchise meditates on the relationship between Black Africans and the global diaspora. Now comesSinners, a Jim Crow period piece that frames the Black experience in America as a horror show – complete with real scars.‘My heart broke’: director Ryan Coogler on mourning Chadwick Boseman, rebooting Black Panther and his new movie SinnersRead moreThe film, which made its theatrical debut over the weekend, follows Sammie – a young guitar hero (played by newcomer Miles Caton) itching to break away from his preacher father and the family church to play the blues for the unsaved masses. He gets his big break when his twin cousins (both played byMichael B Jordan) open a juke joint in their Clarksdale, Mississippi, home town with the ill-gotten gains they acquired during their stint working for Al Capone’s organized crime syndicate in Chicago. The pop-up grand opening, a major attraction for Clarksdale’s hard-working community of sharecroppers, offers them a hard-earned night-time catharsis until a trio of bloodthirsty vampires appears. That they also happen to be white is no accident.The Black and white framing might sound heavy-handed in passing, but that’s only because films have traditionally presented it in reverse. Coogler, though, doesn’t just flip the script. He suffuses it with deep cultural and historical context. He shows how Black Americans manage to find happiness in spite of the false choices they’re presented to carry out their lives – in this case through the story of the great migration. “It’s a personal obsession of mine,” he toldthe Guardian, “this period of time when Black people were considering leaving the south en masse.”The largest internal migration in US history at the time, the great migration was the movement that saw millions of Black Americans emigrate from the rural south to the Rust belt and Sun belt as segregation took hold in the early 20th century. From 1910 to 1940, nearly 2 million people left the American south, home to 90% of the Black population, in the first wave of the great migration; it reshaped cities such as Los Angeles, Philadelphia and New York – where the great migration gave rise to theHarlem Renaissance. For Black Mississippians, Chicago becamethedestination, and the Illinois Central Railroad offered a direct route. The Black southerners who couldn’t afford a ticket to ride walked along the 800-mile railroad in a quest for genuine freedom.Sinners review – Ryan Coogler’s deep-south gonzo horror down at the crossroadsRead moreBut Black southerners soon found that racism was very much alive and well in those other parts of the country too, and Sinners nods at this disappointment. Early in the film, Sammie pictures Chicago as a paradise of Black tolerance and self-determination, and the twins waste no time setting the record straight on the US’s most segregated city. “Chicago ain’t shit but tall buildings instead of plantations,” one of the twins tells him. Later on, the film brings up a town outside of Clarksdale, the birthplace of the blues, that Black people have made into their own utopia – but the idea is greeted with a degree of skepticism that foreshadows real-world tragedies such as Tulsa’s Black Wall Street and other thriving Black enclaves that were razed either because of white supremacy or eminent domain. In the end, those escapes were false choices, too.In Sinners, death and bloodshed are par for the genre. Really, it is all the false choices the characters are forced into that make the film scarily familiar – even if Coogler swears he wasn’t trying to make a modern allegory. (“Any direct ties with what’s happening right now are, like, totally coincidental, or ironic,” said Coogler, who wrote the story two years before the current administration took office.) For Sammie, it was either misery on the plantation or survivor’s guilt. For Smoke, the level-headed twin in Jordan’s gemini performance, it was either reckoning with white supremacy alone but alive, or true freedom, happiness and a complete Black family in the afterlife. For Delta Slim (Delroy Lindo), the famous local bluesman, it was either the living nightmares of Jim Crow or a halfway comfortable escape at the bottom of a bottle. Even the battle between the Black townspeople and the white undead is presented as a choice between spiritual unity or subjugation in the flesh.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc./PAThat it all comes to a head at the juke joint grand opening is no coincidence. The party winds up telling a larger story about Black people’s knack for carving out joy in the midst of tragedy. Sinners hammers home the point in a supernatural party scene that connects Black revelers from generations past and future. As I watched it, I couldn’t help thinking about how Black Americans have made a point of wallowing in joy and self-preservation in the midst of today’s doomed political climate. While white Americans angrily take to the streets, Black Americans gather at weddings and baby showers and cookouts to indulge the newest party craze – the “Pop That Fan” line dance. “Fans have replaced the signs, and joy has replaced the rage,” the former New York Times columnist Charles M Blow wrote in arecent Instagram post. “Politics are important and have their place, but Black people at the moment are dwelling in the healing power of community.”The horror of all these false choices really leaves you cold when Sammie reflects on the juke joint party later on in Sinners. He calls it the best night of his lifeandthe worst night of his life. That is the Black experience in America in a nutshell, and it figures that Coogler’s allegory would get the visceral details of this undying real-life horror so right.Explore more on these topicsRyan CooglerMichael B JordanBlack US cultureHorror filmsRacecommentShareReuse this content"

People would approach you for autographs … they would scream at you on the street … you wouldn’t know what was going on. I stopped still and gawped at him. “That’s the plot of The Lizzie McGuire Movie,” I said. And that’s when I found out that the man I was going to marry had never seen the greatest film of all time.‘Never fails to make my day’: readers on their feelgood moviesRead moreMovies with the word “movie” in the title are not usually considered the world’s best and yes, officially The Lizzie McGuire Movie is a flop, with a 41% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. But the coming-of-age comedy was released in 2003, at a time when critics were allowed to hate teenage girls a little more openly than they’re allowed to hate teenage girls today. That might be “irrelevant” because the “experts” were “technically correct” in noting that the movie is not a masterpiece, but I believe it is at least a masterpiece of the genre. By which I mean: at one point, an Italian woman manhandles Hilary Duff before handing her a giant wheel of cheese.The Lizzie McGuire Movie is a spin-off of the Disney channel show of basically the same name. Our lovable hero, Lizzie (Duff), graduates middle school and goes on a trip to Rome with her classmates. When she gets there, she realises – via gifted cheese – that she is the spitting image of the Italian pop star Isabella Parigi (who – hold onto your jaws as I say this – is also played by Duff). Hijinks ensue.In short: Isabella’s singing partner Paolo Valisari whizzes Lizzie around on his moped and subjects her to a makeover montage. Why? Because he wants Lizzie to perform as Isabella, who has left Italy, at the International Music Video Awards. Are his motivations nefarious? You bet they are! But the only way for Lizzie to discover this is by donning a sparkly lilac top with a square inexplicably cut out around her belly button.Nostalgia clouds the mind but I do think this movie is genuinely funny – Alex Borstein as school trip wrangler Miss Ungermeyer is a particular highlight (“Put your money in your front pockets,” she warns the kids after catching sight of slick pop star Paolo). While the film is undeniably a trite tableau of teen movie cliches, it avoids the harshest and grossest ones that were popular at the time. No one is mocked for having an eating disorder or stalked oh-so-romantically. It is aspirational in the silliest sense – while other movies might’ve inspired you to flirt like this or dance like that, nothing in The Lizzie McGuire Movie could be copied: you’re either in danger of being mistaken for an Italian pop star or you’re not. This means it didn’t make 11-year-old me feel bad about herself, and it still makes adult me feel good.I often think about the overlap in “boy” and “girl” culture. A young teenage girl will consume – or at least try out – the same stuff as a teenage boy, because of the value society affords anything masculine (and because we wanted boys to kiss us). As a teen girl, I watched Fight Club and played Fifa, but how many straight boys read The Princess Diaries or watched Lizzie McGuire? There are huge gaping holes in men’s cultural knowledge: most have never seen a Duff-Duff duet in the Colosseum, one Duff in purple, the other in green, both singing the words “hey, now” a total of 23 times.I couldn’t marry a man who had never heard the lyrics “Hey, now, hey, now, this is what dreams are made of”, so I left my fiance at the altar three months after our trip to Seville. I’m kidding, of course – but naturally I did force him to watch the film before we married, and unbeknownst to me he even slipped a reference to it into our vows. In front of who else but Italian civil officials, my husband promised to watch the film with me at least once a year. It was a light aside in vows that were otherwise (I swear,I swear) deeply meaningful, but I’m still going to hold him to that promise – until death do us hey, now.Explore more on these topicsComedy filmsMy feelgood movieComedyDisney ChannelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it has the potential to launch us on a curious and profound journey of discoveryMoya SarnerMon 21 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTShareThere is a national conversation – or perhaps more a national talking at each other – taking place at the moment, about an “overdiagnosis” of mental health conditions. The health secretary,Wes Streeting, is concerned too many people are being “written off” in this way. I spend quite a lot of time thinking about this subject, alone, with colleagues, with patients as a therapist, and as a patient in therapy myself. I think our response is crucial for building not just a better life but a better society.I think that diagnosis can be a vital part of mental health treatment. It is not something I do as a psychotherapist; I respect my psychiatrist colleagues who do it for their skill, knowledge, experience and compassion. When the system works, a diagnosis can bring relief, it can open the door to the best therapy and medication, and finding a name for your experience can feel containing and valuable.But.A diagnostic approach to oneself is not always helpful. I think we all have a tendency to use a diagnosis to close a door, rather than open it. We can often use a diagnosis – depression, say, or obsessive-compulsive disorder, or autism spectrum disorder, or anxiety – to stop any further thinking, to close down any search for meaning in our own experience as human beings, with our individual histories, relationships and pain. Closing the door to our minds like this can close off the possibility of building a better life.View image in fullscreenHealth secretary Wes Streeting.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PATake, for example, a diagnosis of ADHD. Many people feel seen when they receive this diagnosis – it feels like an answer to a question they have been asking for much of their lives.In my work with patients, I see its value not as an answer, but as the opening of a new question. ADHD is a description of a collection of symptoms; experience and research indicate that medication might help, that there might be some genetic and neurodevelopmental foundation to these difficulties. But it doesn’t have to end there. A person might gain an even more valuable understanding of themselves if they delve below that diagnosis and explore what unwanted feelings they are avoiding when they are late for appointments, what traumas or memories or thoughts they are moving away from when they cannot sit still, what unconscious dynamics they are repeating when they find it impossible to complete a task. These difficulties can – not always, but sometimes – be understood in therapy in a way that brings a different kind of meaning and a deeper sense of self-understanding. These feelings and beliefs can be made conscious and worked through; a capacity to tolerate difficult emotions can grow. Or you could shut that all down with, “That’s just my ADHD.”It was once my privilege to interview Gianna Williams, a child and adult psychoanalyst, and she drew my attention to a powerful dimension of the word “understand”: understanding as standing under something and looking up, trying to explore phenomena from a position of not knowing, and being curious about what you might find. This is a very different approach from diagnosing. Rather than knowing something and applying a label to an experience from above, you are developing a capacity to tolerate not knowing, and trying to explore a feeling and put it into words.I think we all have a tendency to use a diagnosis to close a door, rather than open itThis kind of understanding is what I have been offered by my psychoanalyst, and it’s the kind of understanding I seek to offer my patients as their psychodynamic psychotherapist (these forms of therapy are rooted in the same theories). But it takes time. It can only happen in a robust, sustained therapeutic relationship, in which difficult feelings can be faced and valued, the unconscious can begin to be made conscious, ruptures can be tolerated and repaired, and a person can grow and develop.Sometimes, remarkable recovery can take place with this kind of therapy. Patients who had been “written off”, to use the health secretary’s words, who had indeed written themselves off, can find resources they didn’t know they had, and perhaps didn’t previously have, to understand where their difficulties come from, turn towards themselves and attend to these difficulties in a way that is not punitive, but helpful. They can realise that the unconscious dynamics that have haunted them since their earliest days are now no longer required, and can be laid to rest. It is not unusual, for example, to see patients encounter within themselves a desire and capacity to seek, find and sustain work that had previously felt impossible to them.Does the UK have a mental health overdiagnosis problem?Read moreRegrettably, I have not seen any plans from the health secretary to offer funding for sustained psychoanalytic psychotherapy for patients who want it. There is plenty of evidence to show that this kind of therapy can help patients with entrenched difficulties including so-calledtreatment resistant depression. But I suspect that this treatment doesn’t fit in with Streeting’s own “diagnosis” of the problem. He has his eyes on the cost of benefits, and not on the savings that might come from investing in well-trained therapists who can help patients find their own way forward in their lives. It’s a travesty for us as a society and as individuals, because talking about reducing a person’s benefits while at the same time denying them the treatment they might use to build a better life is, to my mind, a sure way to perpetuate the kind of writing off he is seeking to avoid.Moya Sarner is an NHS psychotherapist and the author ofWhen I Grow Up – Conversations With Adults in Search of AdulthoodDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Then, one day, I picked up a box. It was bulky but not particularly heavy. I felt a twinge in my back, but thought nothing of it. I played basketball that evening and went to bed as normal.In the morning, I couldn’t get up. The pain when I tried was so intense, I was sobbing. I moved a millimetre at a time, eventually making it upright after about half an hour. Once I was up, I couldn’t sit down. I shuffled slowly around the house, looking online for answers.TheNHS websitereassured me it was likely a pulled muscle and would get better on its own. In the meantime, I should stay active, take painkillers, alternate between ice (frozen peas) and heat (a hot-water bottle) and do some stretches. Stretching was out of the question, but I dutifully did everything else.A few days later, I hobbled to see a doctor. She told me my muscles had gone into spasm and would soon relax. But it didn’t get better and eventually, in desperation, I went for a private MRI scan after several weeks off work. It turned out the pain wasn’t muscular at all. I had a herniated disc in my lower back, which was pressing on my sciatic nerve.I started physio and slowly things improved. But when I returned to work, my progress plateaued. Then I had a few relapses and realised that sitting down all day was the worst thing I could do, so I requested a standing desk.I was often the only person standing up in the office, so I felt like a meerkat on sentinel dutyThe desk was adjustable so I could alternate sitting and standing, but as my back hurt whenever I sat for more than a few minutes, I rarely did. Standing was tiring – I was exhausted for the first week – but I quickly got used to it. Creative tasks were more difficult at first: I could answer routine emails but struggled to write an article, for example. Again, though, I soon adjusted.I was often the only person standing up in the office, so I felt like a meerkat on sentinel duty. Colleagues asked questions, and now a few with bad backs have standing desks too. I think all office workers should have the option to stand –people who sit for long periodsare more likely to die earlier. Scandinavians know they’re on to a good thing – more than 80% of office workers in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark are reported to have access to a standing desk (as opposed to 1% in the UK), and it is mandatory for employers in Denmark to offer sit-stand workstations.Now I stand all day, but take regular breaks to move around (standing still for more than two hoursmay have its own health risks). When I work from home, I still mainly stand, balancing my laptop on a pile of books. I try to maintain good posture – and I make sure I bend my knees when I pick up a box. I haven’t put my back out for five years.Last month, a global study found thatexercise is one of the few effective non-surgical treatmentsfor lower back pain.

A study published last year by a US financial services company, Bread Financial, found 26% of people felt they were “financially incompatible” with their friends, while 21% said they had lost a friendship because of money.According to Talia Loderick, a money coach, the wealth gap between friends is something more people should be mindful of. “It’s so easy to let friendships fall by the wayside because we’re so awkward and money’s so emotional,” she says.When dining with friends, it is important to understand everyone’s views on how the costs should be divvied up before you split the bill. This is a topic that divides opinion. When the comparison website Compare the Market carried out a survey of diners, it found 34% thought a bill should be split evenly, including the tip, while 36% said it should be divided according to who had what.Vivi Friedgut is the founder and chief executive ofBlackbullion, a free-to-use money management app for students. She says that whether it is splitting the cost of household items or eating out, it is vital to have open and honest conversations right at the outset to make sure that “everyone is clear that somebody is fully paying, or that everything is being split across the group equally”.… especially at universityView image in fullscreenVivi Friedgut, the founder and chief executive of Blackbullion, says it is vital to have open and honest conversations right at the outset.Photograph: RooM the Agency/AlamyTom Allingham, communications director at the money websiteSave the Student, says: “People will often say, ‘I’ll get this, and you get the next thing.’ But what you find over time is that that doesn’t even out. So it might be that one of you gets one dinner and that might be £50, then the other one gets the next dinner. But that might only be £20.” Over time, what can happen is “one of you ends up being far more in the red than the other”, he adds.According to the most recent Save the Student data, the typical maintenance loan that most students take onfalls £504 shorteach month of covering the average living costs. That could create issues for some more than others within the same friendship group when it comes to splitting costs.Use an appView image in fullscreenApps can take the hassle out of dividing the bill.Photograph: UrbanImages/AlamyThere are a growing number of bill-splitting apps and services that take the hassle out of dividing expenses between lots of people. You may want to look at a few to figure out which one(s) work best for your particular circumstances.The best-known bill-splitting app is probablySplitwise. Launched in 2011, it enables you to keep track of unpaid bills, rent, holiday, food and travel costs and other shared expenses.Splitwise works as an IOU app whereby you sign up and create a group. Then you and your friends can start adding expenses. To do this, go to your group on the app, then hit the “add bill” button. You will be asked for various details about the expense, such as the total cost, who paid and how much each person owes. When you hit “save”, the app will update everyone’s balances.To settle up, UK users normally have to exit the app and go to their banking app or website to initiate payment, or hand over some physical cash, then return to Splitwise to confirm they have paid.No one likes nitpicking at the end of a meal or on holiday. Apps can take that conversation awayTalia LoderickHowever, a link-upa year ago between the app and the payment services platform Tink enables UK Splitwise users to make direct payments to friends and family from within the Splitwise app.To use this, you need to link your bank account with Splitwise.The app is free to use, but also offers a premium service with extra features called Splitwise Pro, which is £3.99 a month or £39.99 a year.Splid is another free-to-use appavailable for UK users. It doesn’t require you to register for an account. The app lets you choose from more than 150 local currencies and works offline, too, which means it could be especially useful if you are travelling as a group of friends in places where there is limited internet access.Another free app to help keep track of and settle shared expenses istricount, which is owned by the European financial firm Bunq, and boasts it has “millions of users worldwide”.These sorts of apps can really come into their own in terms of taking away some of the awkwardness associated with splitting costs fairly and settling up, says Loderick.She adds: “No one likes the nitpicking at the end of a meal or on holiday. The apps can take that conversation away.”Allingham says apps such as Splitwise can be particularly effective for splitting small expenses between friends, such as grabbing a coffee.See what your bank offersView image in fullscreenSome banks offer bill-splitting services.Photograph: Chris Ratcliffe/REX ShutterstockNatWest used to offer a well-regarded bill-splitting app called Housemate that was designed to “take the stress out of renting” by splitting bills and keeping track of shared expenses. Unfortunately, Housemate is now no more –it was shut down in Februarythis year.However, several other banks have similar tools.The app-based bank Monzo has a feature called Split which it says “lets you split, track and chase payments, all in one safe place”. It enables people to keep track of joint expenses such as household bills, and also allows them to split one-off payments such as a dinner. An individual can be added to a Split even if they do not bank with Monzo (they need to be invited by a customer though).Starling Bank offers an in-app feature called Split the Bill, which it says lets you work out who owes what and send out “IOUs” in just a few taps. Recipients of the IOUs will be taken to a secure webpage to pay you back – or they can do it directly from the app if they also bank with Starling.The UK digital bank Kroo is another that offers bill splitting. You can set up a group in the app and add your collective spending. Anyone can be part of a group, and you can send a non-Kroo customer a payment link, but if they are not an account holder, they won’t be notified they have joined a group, and they won’t be able to see the group details.Revolut also lets customers split bills with other users.Explore more on these topicsFintechMoney hacksFriendshipHousehold billsRestaurantsAppsBanks and building societiesStudentsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hake is my new go-to white fish: it’s sustainable, it has a lovely texture, it roasts beautifully and it’s the perfect foil for a spicy topping. My sambal pays homage to the Indonesian versions made with tomatoes and chilli – it starts off as a light, fresh sauce that cooks down beautifully with the fish and tomatoes.Roast hake with tomato and chilli sambalFor ease, I use a high-speed blender to make the sambal.Prep15 minCook25 minServes2300g cherry vine tomatoes, halved4 echalion shallots, peeled and quartered1tbsp neutral oil1tsp sea salt flakes2 thick hake fillets(about 160g each)30g salted peanuts,roughly chopped5g chives, finely slicedHot white rice, to serveFor the sambal2 largelong red chillies, likereallylarge ones, deseeded60g cherry vine tomatoes½ lemongrass stick, roughly chopped2echalionshallots, peeled2garlic cloves1tsp sea salt flakes, plus extra to serve20ml neutral oil1tbsp palm sugar, or dark brown sugar½ lime, juiced, plus extra to serveHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7.

Take the roasting tin out of the oven, make two wells in the tomato mixture with the back of a spoon, then place a hake fillet in each of them. Spread a good two to three tablespoons of the sambal over the fish, then stir the rest into the tomatoes and shallots. Return the tin to the oven until the fish is just cooked through – 18 minutes for very thick fillets, 15 minutes for thinner ones – then taste and add a little more salt or lime juice, if you wish.Scatter the salted peanuts and chives all over the top, then serve with hot white rice.The Guardian aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

They belonged to thelate cook and teacher Carla Tomasi, who wanted them to be useful, so gave them to theLatteria cooking studio. However, until the studio has more shelves, I have 15 of Carla’s 60 books sitting by my desk. They are a well-loved pile, but five in particular stand out as having been used and used. The first isDan Lepard’s Short and Sweet, which, thanks to grey duct tape, is just about holding together, and the second isThane Prince’s Perfect Preserves, also duct-taped. The third is a 1985 edition ofClaudia Roden’s A Book of Middle Eastern Food, the fourthElisabeth Luard’s 1991 The Flavours of Andalusiaand the fifthAnna del Conte’s 1987 Gastronomy of Italy, all of which are missing at least one cover, have loose pages and bite marks (dogs?), are covered in brown paper and have their titles written on them with marker pen.As anyone who worked with or was taught by Carla will know, she was a cooking snowball: always gathering. Also, that she was immensely generous in her acknowledgements, carefully noting the place, book or person from whom she had gathered it. Del Conte, in particular, was someone who came up constantly, and Carla referred to Gastronomy of Italy, which she bought a few years after arriving in London, as a life-changing book that taught her about the country she had left.I have been imagining myself as 35-year-old Carla, sitting at her kitchen table just off Tottenham Court Road, making notes on the map at the beginning of the book. Later, when Carla was giving lessons upstairs atBooks for Cooks, she would meet Anna. Years after that, Carla and I would make Anna’s fennel with pistachio, lemon and anchovy sauce for a class at Latteria Studio. Anna had learned the recipe from the 18th-century writer Vincenzo Corrado, to whom she refers as one of her favourite cookery writers and notes that the dish “leaves you delighted yet puzzled as to how such an unlikely combination of flavours could blend with such complete harmony”. Carla agreed – and I did, too – and here is the recipe.Corrado’s concise recipe includes no mention of resting, or indeed any serving suggestions, for that matter, but he was writing in 1773 and for experienced cooks preparing extravagant, carefully controlled feasts. Del Conte, on the other hand, writing in 1986, suggests covering and resting the dish in the fridge for 24 hours, then bringing it back to room temperature before serving.I took the opportunity to taste at various stages and two stood out: about an hour after mixing, when the dressing has started to sink in but the lemon is still fresh; and after 24 hours, by which time the dressing and fennel are inseparable and the dish sits halfway between a dressed vegetable and a relish. Complete harmony served with a few crushed pistachios, more olive oil and the reserved fennel fronds, plus roast chicken, grilled fish, pork chops or hard-boiled eggs.Anna del Conte and Vincenzo Corrado’s fennel with pistachio, lemon and anchovy sauceServes43-4fennel bulbs(about 700g in total)300ml dry white wine2 bay leaves2½cm cinnamon stick8 whole peppercorns30g pistachios, skin rubbed away as much as possible, plus extra to finish3 anchovy fillets1 tsp sugar4 tbsp olive oil,plus extra to serve2 tsp white-wine vinegar2-4 tbsp lemon juice, plus finely grated lemon zest to tasteTrim the fennel and remove and discard the outer layer if bruised or particularly thick; save any frilly fronds. Cut the bulbs first into quarters and then into slim wedges (don’t worry if they fall apart a bit).Put the wine, bay leaves, cinnamon and peppercorns in a pan, add the fennel and enough water just to cover the fennel, then bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for about eight minutes, until the fennel is just tender. Drain and put the fennel in a shallow dish.For the sauce, and working in either a mortar or food processor, grind or blend the pistachios, anchovy, sugar, olive oil and white-wine vinegar to a thick paste. Add the lemon juice, tasting as you go, and the lemon zest to your liking. Pour the dressing over the fennel, toss well, then rest for 20 minutes to 24 hours (for anything over two hours, cover and keep in fridge).Before serving, let the dish return to room temperature, then finish with a few crushed pistachios, a bit more olive oil and the reserved fennel fronds, if you like.Explore more on these topicsItalian food and drinkA kitchen in RomeFoodVegetablesSide dishesFishSeafoodNuts and seedsrecipesShareReuse this content"

Now I’m paying someone else’s debt on my prepay meterIn her final Your Problems column for the Observer, Anna Tims hears from a refugee suffering at the hands of British GasAnna TimsMon 21 Apr 2025 03.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Apr 2025 08.13 EDTShareBritish Gas is causing me mental breakdown. I am a refugee and was grateful to be given a social housing flat. I duly informed British Gas, which supplies thegas on a prepayment meter and electricity, which was supposed to be billed. They sent me a new code and top-up card and I paid in £60. It turned out the previous tenant had left a £236 debt, presumably on the electricity account. British Gas siphoned off £54 and left me with £6 worth of fuel.Over the following weeks I questioned my sanity because every time I rang customer services, it kept telling me over and over to do the same thing, kept claiming that the matterwas resolved and kept refusing to register a complaint. One adviser told me the only solution was for me to pay the debt. When my gas supply twice cut out, I called the emergency line and technicians visited to apply an emergency credit. I was assured the debt had been decoupled from my account and was told it would take up to 42 days to refund me the money they had taken. I had to spend Christmas and new year without heating or hot water.I transferred to Ovo, which, bizarrely, triggered letters from British Gas welcoming me as a new customer. The first time I used the Ovo card to top up, half my credit disappeared. Turns out British Gas had taken it against the previous tenant’s debt. British Gas said it couldn’t help as I was no longer a customer.I have a government voucher of £150 given to people on low income. It will expire in a couple of days. My choice is to lose it or to donate it to British Gas.LA, LondonI’ve become pretty hardened to customer failings, but some situations can still cause me to seethe and yours is such a one. You first wrote to me in December. It was supposed to be a time of celebration, you told me, because after much hardship you had secured a flat and a job. But you felt unable to socialise with your new colleagues because, thanks to British Gas, you’d spent weeks without hot water to shower or launder. You said your flat was so cold you’d huddle in bed before and after work and you often spent money you could ill afford on takeaways because washing up was so difficult.You suffer from rheumatoid arthritis, which is made worse by the cold, caught a chest infection during the weeks without heat, and say you became so stressed you were unable to eat. British Gas called you the day after I questioned its conduct, but only to state that it would refund you the £70 of your money that it had pocketed within 28 days. To me it merely declared blandly that it was sorry for the “upset” it had caused and would be offering “goodwill” on top of the refund.The latter arrived in a misspelled cheque a week later along with an offer of £100. You and I agreed that that was derisory given your ordeal and British Gas upped it to £200, which you accepted. Had you not, I would have advised you to contact the energy ombudsman, which has powers to order redress and compensation if a complaint is upheld.Although even an ombudsman ­ruling can be ineffectual. So impervious is British Gas to customer suffering that the Centre for Sustainable Energy (CSE) sent me an SOS on behalf ofMD, a disabled single mother trapped in a see-sawing billing nightmare since 2021.“At CSE we have 45 years’ experience advocating on behalf of people with energy companies, and this is one of the worst cases we’ve ever seen,” it told me.MD’s account balance has fluctuated wildly between -£4,000 and +£5,000, and despite an order by the ombudsman last November to recalculate it, she has yet to receive an accurate statement.The fear is that if her alleged balance deficit plunges below £5,000, MD will be ineligible for a British Gas Energy Trust grant, available to indebted customers on low incomes.The problems began when British Gas raised her affordable payment plan without warning, leaving her struggling to afford food and unable to heat her home in winter. She then discovered that her account was £1,000 in credit. That was in 2023. Since then she has received no bill and her online balance has switchbacked between improbable four-figure debits and credits.When I contacted British Gas it blamed “human errors”. It was “human error” that prevented it issuing an accurate bill after the ombudsman ruling. This omission led, mystifyingly, to a credit of £5,068.59 showing on her account. It has now applied up-to-date meter readings to produce a debt of £1,285.32 which it has written off to gratify theObserver– I mean, MD.And that’s it from me!This is my final Your Problems column for theObserver.

The younger son of one-time Lord Chancellor Sir Michael Havers, Havers Jr opted against Eton, moving into theatre, radio and briefly training as a wine merchant, before finding fame as the lead of the 1977 BBC adaptation of Nicholas Nickleby, and opposite Bob Hoskins in 1978 Dennis Potter BBC musical drama, Pennies from Heaven.By the time he was cast in 1981’s Chariots of Fire, Havers was a familiar face on British television. Here, he got to play his first lord – Cambridge student Lord Andrew Lindsay – and run, barefooted and in slow motion, across West Sands beach in St Andrews, earning him a Bafta nomination in the process. Roles soon followed as the public school-educated but class-conscious Ronnie Heaslop in 1984 epic period drama A Passage to India, and as father figure Dr Rawlins in Steven Spielberg’s 1987 war film Empire of the Sun. He also plays David Niven in 2004’s The Life and Death of Peter Sellers.Havers has spent the most recent part of his career on television, continuing the well-educated/peerage theme. His roles as lords (we count four) include Lord Hepworth in Downton Abbey and his portrayal of the beaten-down-by-the-bad-guys Lord Whitecroft in Guy Ritchie’s 2024 Netflix series, The Gentleman – one of his most “is it Nigel or is he acting?” parts to date. As doctors (we count five), he most famously played Dr Tom Latimer in all six series of the 80s BBC sitcom Don’t Wait Up, and as Dr Jonathan Paige in ITV medical drama, Dangerfield.

It positions White Fox as the brand hot girls wear to cool parties, and generates fear of missing out in the process.Jennifer Piña, of influencer marketing agency Magic Links, says White Fox stands out from other fast fashion brands such as Boohoo and Shein “because their curation is much cleaner … and they work with aspirational creators who are also getting deals from luxury and mid-market brands”.White Fox advertisements – with their provocative poses – adorn buses and billboards all over Sydney, London and Los Angeles. This gets the message to tweens sitting in cars with their parents, but beneath the most visible aspect of their strategy is a huge network of online influencer-driven marketing.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThe brand’s founders, Daniel and Georgia Contos, learned about the power of influencers early. The business started as an eBay store in 2013. When Georgia included a photograph of Kim Kardashian wearing a previously unpopular dress in a listing, it sold for more than double her purchase price.View image in fullscreenA White Fox billboard in Los Angeles. The brand launched in the US in 2019.Photograph: Alyx Gorman/The Guardian“I was so inspired by the influence of celebrity style and the impact it could have on sales that I knew I had to take it to the next level,” she toldForbes in 2020(Daniel and Georgia Contos declined to be interviewed for this story).Twelve years later, in certain demographics, the brand feels omnipresent. They have amassed 2.6 million followers on Instagram and 1.1 million on TikTok. White Fox hoodies, instantly identifiable by their bubble-font logo, are a must-have item for teenage girls. Their bandage dresses, triangle bikinis and track pants are worn by celebrities Emily Ratajkowski and Hailey Bieber, alongside Love Island UK winner Gabby Allen and Selling Sunset’s Chrishell Stause.The expense of collaborating with influencers is hard to pinpoint, but Piña says someone with 1 million followers typically earns $16,000 ($10,000 US) for a 30 second video. Brent Coker, a lecturer in viral marketing at the University of Melbourne, estimates a $25,000 budget might be enough to engage three influencers with 50,000 followers each. Since influencer marketing is now well established, Piña says brands can determine how each view translates to their bottom line, and tailor their strategies accordingly.View image in fullscreenBecky Hill performs at The Future is White Fox Party in London.

Selling dresses for $89.95 and tops for $49.95 makes White Fox more expensive than ultra-fast fashion brands Shein and Temu, but a similar price point to Zara and H&M.The brand has faced similar criticism to other fast fashion companies. In 2023, customers criticised a video the companyposted to Instagram storiesshowing garbage bags filled with garments in their warehouse. In 2024, Baptist World Aid said White Foxcould not be included in their annual ethical fashion reportbecause they did not provide information about their manufacturing practices.Poor customer service has been an issue too. At the end of 2023, a Black Friday sale created a backlog of orders so big, they cancelled their Boxing Day promotions. At the time, Daniel Contos told A Current Affair: “We are doing everything we can to get [orders] out as quick as possible. We’re learning as we go and yes even though we’re 10 years in … as we scale with growth, there’s always going to be learning curves.”View image in fullscreenTikTok creator Josh Richards wearing one of the brand’s popular hoodies at a 2023 White Fox event in Los Angeles.Photograph: Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for CLD PR/White FoxDespite criticism, their growth has been meteoric. In 2019, White Fox launched in the US, and three years later they expanded to the UK. In 2024, across the White FoxAustraliaandUnited Stateswebsites, they recorded almost US$73.8m in sales. At the start of April, White Fox bought a five-storey commercial office building in Sydney’sRosebery for A$70m, while the personal property portfolio of Georgia and Daniel Contos (who are 33 and 34) includesfive mansions in the upmarket Sydney suburb of Vaucluseworth an estimated A$150m.The volume of content shared across White Fox social media platforms has also grown explosively. Data from the consultantsCreatorIQsuggests White Fox posted almost 25,000 times in 2023 – about five times more than in 2018.While some of this marketing is paid for, some is customer generated. Customers are encouraged to post photos of themselves wearing White Fox, adding to the brand’s reach. Sharing pictures also creates a sense of community for their young buyers –often described as the loneliest generation.‘Quite dodgy’: what kind of outfit does $80 buy at Temu and Shein?Read moreThe brand also engages aspiring influencers under their “White Fox University” program. Student customerswith at least 2,000 followersapply to become ambassadors, and those who are successful receive a free outfit every month, along with discount codes to share on social media.Eva Harkin, a 23-year-old film and digital media graduate from the University of Galway, has been a White Fox ambassador for eight months. “If you told me a year ago that I would be working with one of my favourite brands I wouldn’t believe you,” she says.Harkin has almost 7,000 Instagram followers, and estimates she spends about 10 hours a month planning, editing and shooting White Fox content. “I love going to the events and getting to meet other creators,” she says. “In the future I would like to be doing content creation full-time.”Coker describes the White Fox University program as “Hotmail viral”, referring to the email service popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s. “[Hotmail] went viral simply by including a link at the bottom of every email that said ‘refer a friend and get a free something’.“Where there’s an incentive for people to spread the message – like free clothes – they’ll sell your products for you,” he says. “It’s quite clever actually.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian fashionAustralian lifestyleSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the time, the country’s prime minister, Dickon Mitchell, described the destruction as “almost Armageddon-like”. On the small island ofCarriacou, it was estimated by officials that more than 90% of the buildings were damaged or destroyed. Agriculture and infrastructure for electricity and communication were almost completely wiped out.Nearly a year on, there are some signs of recovery and rebuilding, but hollowed-out buildings, roofless houses and charred, dying mangroves tell the story of a community that is still coming to grips with the devastation.Some people are still living in tents. Artists Michael Alexander and Yolanda VendenDunden pitched theirs on the foundations of one of the many houses demolished by the hurricane.VendenDunden had just moved to the island from the Netherlands when authorities announced Beryl was coming. The artists say the hurricane was much worse than they expected.View image in fullscreenYolanda VendenDunden and Michael Alexander with their tent on Carriacou in Grenada.Photograph: Haron Forteau/The Guardian“The roof started to shake, and the walls caved in. Yolanda passed out,” said Alexander.They survived, but they lost their home and many of their possessions. Suddenly homeless, they decided to live in the tent, with a makeshift bathroom and kitchen beside it. “I built up back the kitchen and bathroom from the pieces of the house and blocked it off so the lady could get privacy. And we sleep in the tent,” said Alexander.The tent gives them some privacy, but it gives them no refuge from the oppressive heat. And local farmers say that heat is causing droughts which are worse every year.Gifford Andrew, a farmer on Carriacou, said the combination of hurricanes and water shortages makes farming extremely challenging.View image in fullscreenGifford Andrew at his farm on Carriacou.Photograph: Haron Forteau/The Guardian“I lost everything in Beryl. Now I’m trying to put the pieces back together, but I have to deal with the drought. Every single year it’s worse, and it means a lot more water is needed to water my plot. It’s really hard,” he said.The triple whammy of hurricanes, drought and coastal erosion makes the island one of the starkest examples ofclimate crisischallenges, said the Carriacou government official and environmentalist Davon Baker. “The impact of climate change has been pretty severe. In addition to hurricanes, we are losing a lot of beach space to rising sea levels, and we are having extreme and intense dry seasons, which affect our farming and ability to produce food,” he said.From foul to fuel: how a seaweed problem could power the CaribbeanRead moreIn the face of these serious and multiple climate crisis-related threats, Grenada’s prime minister has been advocating for more support from rich countries, which he said had built their wealth by polluting the planet. Grenada last year joined other vulnerable countries ina landmark case at the international court of justicewhich seeks to hold polluting countries accountable for their roles in the climate crisis.At the same time as that push for climate accountability, Caribbean leaders have been stepping up their pursuit of reparatory justice over the centuries-long transatlantic slave trade, which saw more than 12.5 million Africans kidnapped, forcibly transported to theAmericasand sold into slavery. They argue that enslavement and colonisation are still having detrimental impacts on their countries’ social and economic development.Now some in the reparations movement are arguing that the two efforts are part of the same struggle. Arley Gill, the head of theGrenadaReparations Commission, has pointed said there was an “inescapable” link between the pursuit of justice for enslavement and justice for climate change.View image in fullscreenA boat graveyard in Dumfries on Carriacou.Photograph: Haron Forteau/The GuardianGill argues that the Industrial Revolution is linked to both slavery and the climate crisis and that the Caribbean’s underdevelopment – itself a legacy of colonialism and enslavement – hampers the region’s ability to deal with the effects of the climate crisis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

And the Industrial Revolution in Europe was fueled by the Atlantic slave trade and slavery. Black people were enslaved in the Caribbean to export cotton and sugar. These raw materials – which were then refined in the factories in Europe and consumed in Europe and sold all over the world – came from the very crimes of humanity which we speak of and for which we claim reparative justice. So that there is an inevitable link between reparative justice and climate change.”View image in fullscreenTevin Andrews, the minister for Carriacou and Petite Martinique, on Carriacou in Grenada.Photograph: Haron Forteau/The GuardianHe added: “More than that, the harm which was caused by the Atlantic slave trade and slavery created a vulnerable environment in the Caribbean. In other words, we lack the resources to address the effects of climate change – and the reason we lack the resources is partly or mostly due to underdevelopment, which was caused by the Atlantic slave trade.”For people in Carriacou who are suffering the ill effects of the climate crisis, the issue has become a matter of survival.On the Grenadian island of Carriacou, even the dead are now climate victimsRead moreSitting in his office in Carriacou, Tevin Andrews, the minister for Carriacou and Petite Martinique, described how he lost a close friend to Beryl.The island, he said, was surviving on hopes and prayers.“Every single year from July to December, we have to, as we say it in the Caribbean,‘ban our belly’ and pray to our God, hoping that nothing strikes us. So we know, first-hand, the experience of climate change, the rising temperature, the rise in sea levels and the devastation that is caused by hurricanes,” he said.Criticising the slow pace of action on the climate crisis and reparations, Andrews said rich countries “built their wealth on our backs, from our hard work and left us high and dry with no infrastructure, with no educational infrastructure”.The lack of engagement and action by richer countries and former colonisers “sends a clear message that really and truly they don’t care about us”, he said.“Their actions have us where we are. And we are going to continue to suffer. We are going to continue to get strong hurricanes. We are going to continue to lose our shorelines. Our islands will disappear.”Explore more on these topicsGrenadaHurricanesClimate crisisSlaveryInfrastructureCaribbeanAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the recent tariff rate hikes mark an even greater blow for the restaurant.Sichuan peppercorns, which create the signature numbing spice of the regional Chinese cuisine, along with other ingredients, face an at least145% tariffafter last week’s tit-for-tat trade battle betweenChinaand the United States. The steep rate is an existential threat for restaurants across the country that rely on specialty ingredients imported from China to craft the authentic flavors of their dishes, said operators who were blindsided.“We’re really worried,” said Jen Lin-Liu, the director of events for Chang Chang. The restaurant is part of the Peter Chang restaurant group that operates a dozen Sichuan restaurants across Washington, Virginia and Maryland.Could Trump’s tariffs give a green light for corporate profiteering?Read moreThe restaurant group sources meats and vegetables from local farmers, including an Amish community in the Finger Lakes region that supplies its shiitake mushrooms and organic pork. Still, it is dependent on imported items such as fermented chili peppers and soy sauce, which give the dishes their unique taste.“Some of the products that we need just do not exist in the United States,” Lin-Liu said.The cost of other items is rising as well. “There are increases in any supply you can think of, from takeout boxes to printer paper to menu printing paper,” she said, adding that if thetariffrates stick, the price of a $20 dish may rise to $35 or $40.View image in fullscreenDumplings at Chang Chang.Photograph: Courtesy of Chang ChangGeorge Chen, the chef who created Eight Tables, a fine-dining restaurant inSan Francisco, said that while some of the items on his menu may be replaceable with options from Taiwan, it undermines the integrity he’s put into sourcing the unique ingredients for his dishes.“Replacements disrupt complex long-term relationships,” explained Chen. “It took me years to find the special spice vendors or the organic tea farmer inChinafrom my many years living and working there.”Eight Tables is part of a larger marketplace called China Live, which includes a dining hall, a cold-drinks bar and a shop that sells wares including chopsticks, glass tea mugs and pots.“The area most concerning is our retail platform,” said Chen. For those items, “it’s not possible to re-order at the tariff rates”.For direct importers, like the Mala Market, an online shop, the tariffs on Chinese products threaten its entire business model. Sichuan peppercorns are popular on the site, but it also sells a number of items produced in their original region using traditional methods. The owner, Taylor Holliday, calls these “heritage products”, which include soy sauce handcrafted in Zhongba, fermented soybeans aged for three years in Sichuan and sesame paste stone-ground in Shandong.US small business owner says China tariffs endanger her company: ‘I could lose my home’Read more“These are products which have been made in that exact area for hundreds if not thousands of years,” said Holliday. “They have such a history, there’s no way these products can be made anywhere else.”While part of Holliday’s business supplies wholesale items to restaurants around the country, the majority of its orders are from home cooks.“A lot of our customers are people who have a cultural or emotional attachment to China,” Holliday said. “It’s more than just the food, it’s a cultural attachment to these products.”EMei, a Sichuan restaurant inPhiladelphia, sources not only its peppercorns from China but also items such as chopsticks and plastic cutlery for takeout orders. Similar to many Chinese restaurants, delivery is a major part of the restaurant’s business.“So far, this is the main impact for us,” said Dan Tsao, the owner of EMei, who said the tariff hikes add about $1 to $1.50 to each delivery order.The tariffs may also create a supply issue for these items.“Importers are pausing more of their orders from China. They think 125% is crazy,” Tsao said.While the restaurant sources many of its ingredients from local farmers, it still relies on some imports from other countries. It orders broccoli from Mexico, shrimp from Ecuador and rice from Thailand. Rice is especially critical; the restaurant runs through a supply of about 200 pounds each night, Tsao said. SinceDonald Trump’s “liberation day” announcement earlier this month, the price per pound has already risen more than 25%.View image in fullscreenA broccoli field in Cadereyta, Nuevo León state, Mexico, on 24 March 2020.Photograph: Julio César Aguilar/AFP/Getty ImagesThe frenetic nature of the tariff policy shifts has left owners and suppliers cautious about which steps to take and how to plan for the future.Temu and Shein warn of US price hikes from next week due to Trump tariffsRead moreTsao has plans to open two more restaurants later this year and has noticed some construction estimates for renovations rising. Most of the building materials come from China, too.“I’m hesitating now,” he said. The possibility of a recession while the prices of supplies and renovations keep going up may change his calculation. “There will be all these ripple effects on the system and there’s so much economic uncertainty,” he added.Holliday said she has one container of product already on the way from China that is scheduled to clear US customs in about five weeks, but will not raise prices until she is forced to.“I’m praying that something happens by then,” she said. But if it doesn’t, she’s resigned to paying the tariffs.“There’s no other way we can run our business,” she said.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsRestaurantsChinaTariffsUS politicsFoodDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead, he was told his 36-year-old son Ashish, a Bhutanese refugee resettled in the US, was being deported.Ashish had been caught in a domestic dispute that led to police involvement. After several days in detention without proper legal support, he was caught up inDonald Trump’s migration crackdownand deported to Bhutan.But what followed was a surreal sequence of events that left Ashish and nine other Bhutanese refugees stateless: abandoned by the country they once fled, expelled by the one they tried to call home, and detained by the one they sought refuge in.Narayan was one of 100,000 Nepali-speaking Bhutanese whofled the country in the early 1990sto escape persecution. Many saw emigration as the only hope for a future. Narayan’s children were granted refugee status in the US, but Narayan himself was disqualified over paperwork errors and he still lives in the Beldangi refugee camp in eastern Nepal.Now, decades later, his son is back – but not welcomed by Bhutan, nor recognized inNepal.According to Nepal’s director general of immigration, Govinda Prasad Rijal, four of the 10 deported Bhutanese refugees, including Ashish, were taken into custody for entering Nepal illegally via India.“They were taken from the refugee camp on 28 March because they had entered Nepal without valid visas,” he said. “Since the matter is still under investigation, we have not decided whether they will be deported to India, returned to Bhutan, or what other action might be taken.”However, after the family filed a habeas corpus petition in Nepal’s supreme court, the court issued an order to produce them before the court on 24 April and not to deport them until then.Ashish and nine others were first flown from the US to Delhi, where they were reportedly treated well and even put up in a hotel during transit. The following day, they were flown to Paro international airport in Bhutan.There, according to Ashish’s father, the Bhutanese government welcomed them courteously but didn’t allow them to stay long. After routine questioning, the group was handed 30,000 Indian rupees each and transported to the Indian border town of Phuentsholing. Within 24 hours, they were out of Bhutan again.“The fact that Bhutan accepted them from the United States shows an acknowledgment of their citizenship. But deporting them to the Indian border within a day reveals a deceptive character,” said Dr Gopal Krishna Shiwakoti, former chair of the Asia Pacific Rights Network. “It’s strange in itself to send them to a country that had earlier refused to recognize them as its citizens, leading the US to resettle them in a third country.”From Phuentsholing, the group made its way to Nepal through Indian intermediaries. Later, Ashish and his friends Santosh Darji, Roshan Tamang and Ashok Gurung were detained by Nepalese authorities.“I was shocked,” Narayan says. “To be treated like a criminal in your own refugee camp, after all these years … it breaks you.”Nepal has no comprehensive legal framework addressing refugee protection or statelessness. That leaves people like Ashish in legal limbo – neither welcomed back by Bhutan nor recognized as refugees in Nepal.Tulsi Bhattarai, the immigration officer leading the investigation, confirmed that four of the 10 individuals were in custody. “Their statements confirm they entered Nepal from Bhutan via India,” he said. “We’ve collected documents from their time in the refugee camps and submitted a full report.”Activists argue the situation echoes the early days of the 1990s refugee crisis.“We’ve come full circle,” says Shiwakoti. “This is a 360-degree repeat of history. Nepal must urgently initiate diplomatic engagement with Bhutan to resolve this issue.”From 2007 to 2018, more than 113,000 Bhutanese refugees were resettled in third countries, mainly the US, according to the UNHCR. But about 6,500 still remain in camps in Nepal, caught in a state of indefinite limbo. Now, for deportees like Ashish, a new crisis is unfolding.International rights groups are raising alarm. In a joint statement, Bhutanese political and civil society leaders have appealed to the United Nations, the US and Indian embassies, and the government of Nepal for intervention. Their core demand is that the 10 deported individuals be recognized as Bhutanese nationals and protected under international refugee law.“These people are not just numbers. They have histories, identities and rights,” says Ram Karki, coordinator of the Global Campaign for the Release of Political Prisoners in Bhutan (GCRPPB).Back in Beldangi, Narayan waits. His son remains in custody, with uncertain future.“I just want my son to be free,” he adds. “We lost our country once. Must we lose it again?”Explore more on these topicsBhutanRights and freedomNepalSouth and central AsiaUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Living in Gaza, where more than 64,000 Palestinianshave been killedby Israel’s assault, and with the tally rising still, his amazement returns, he says, with each morning light.“The war began and life stopped. There is no work or art, we just try to run from one place to another, searching for salvation from the bombing and killing that pursues us. We walk quickly to search for water and food, and running has become the master of all times,” he says.“In these moments, we lose a part of our humanity, our dignity and everything that is beyond endurance.”El Maqosuiis among nearly 2 million Palestinians in Gaza living under the forced displacement and Israeli bombing that has reduced much of the territory to rubble.His work is among that of four Gazan artists who feature in an exhibition entitled Under Fire at theDarat al Fununin Amman, Jordan. All are still creating and using whatever materials they can find, despite living under the daily bombardment.View image in fullscreenBefore the war, Basel Al Maqosui was an art teacher in Beit Lahia; now he says his depictions of life under bombardment are a message to the world.Photograph: Courtesy of Darat al FununWith his black charcoal pencil,El Maqosuihas created haunting images of the catastrophic war. His work depicts men stripped and blindfolded, women in mournful embraces and children with missing limbs amid a sea of tents.“My art is a message I carry to the world that we, the people of Palestine, are under occupation and deserve to live with dignity and freedom like the rest of the peoples of the world,” he says.Before October 2023, El Maqosui worked as an art teacher in the northernGazacity of Beit Lahia. He has been exhibited internationally and has attended residencies in India, Algeria and the US.These notebooks and pens were my refuge, and I placed them in my small bag without worry, as if I were writing my memoirs dailySohail SalemNow, having been displaced from Khan Younis, Rafah, Deir al-Balah, Nuseirat and Az-Zawaida, El Maqosui says he maintains his humanity through the more than 100 workshops he has organised with children, mothers and people with disabilities, entitled Artistic Residence, Not Displacement.He began by gathering children near his tent and giving them the materials to create as their mothers looked on, smiling at the sight of their brief respite. One of the most difficult workshops was with mothers, he says, who cried as they drew their homes and dreams. He cried with them.View image in fullscreenPalestinian artist Basel El Maqosui during one of the workshops for children he hosts in Gaza.Photograph: Courtesy of the Artist“This is what I do during the war. I know very well that it is not much, but I also know that the children were given the opportunity for some time to forget the war, the fear, and the hunger. To forget the time, the suffering and the nightmares day and night,” he says.“I have nothing else to do and I love what I do.”The Under Fire exhibition is the latest example of Darat Al Funun’s dedicated programming in solidarity with Gaza, says its arts and culture director, Khaled al-Bashir.View image in fullscreenThe exhibition at Darat al Funun in Amman, Jordan.Photograph: Courtesy of Darat al Funun“This particular display is especially important within this context, given the circumstances under which these artists continue to create – and their remarkable determination to do so, from within Gaza and under displacement. Needless to say, it also emerges from the absolute necessity to centre Gazan voices at the moment, and the urgency of doing so,” says Bashir.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sohail Salem and Raed Issa were co-founders ofthe Eltiqa Group, and El Maqosui and Majed Shala helped to create Shababeek for Contemporary Art – both of which have been destroyed in the war.On display are Salem’s pen drawings in blue, black and red ink, inside numerous Unrwa notebooks.

This was most brutal when I was forced to pass over the bodies of martyrs during the displacement. Overcrowding of the displaced and listening to the news on the radio at high volume, I tried to separate myself from my surroundings every morning and draw,” says Salem, who buys his tools from a street vendor in Deir al-Balah, where he lives in a garage.In January 2023, Salem was a university art teacher. He was arrested by the Israel Defense Forces at his family home in Al-Rimal, separated from his family and handcuffed and blindfolded before being interrogated. He recalls how a letter of the Hebrew alphabet was written on his forehead, leaving men around him to speculate if this meant he would be killed first. He was later released and able to find his family in Deir al-Balah, where they had fled.View image in fullscreenSome of Salem’s notebooks.

What could I draw in such circumstances? And why? My brain was damaged from the sound of intense bombing that still resonated in my head,” says Salem. Before the war he taught at Al-Aqsa University, and had his work exhibited locally and internationally.“These small notebooks and pens were my refuge, and I placed them in my small bag without worry, as if I were writing my memoirs daily.”The exhibition also includes Issa’s portraits of women and children, using the only materials he could find – he draws on medicine packaging, using karkadeh (hibiscus flower tea) and pomegranate juice alongside ink.View image in fullscreenA selection of Raed Issa’s protraits from the exhibition.

He went on creating, using “whatever he could find” – scraps of paper, watercolours and pens, creating colourful works ranging from the cacti he missed from their balcony to the familiar streets of Gaza.View image in fullscreenTwo landscapes by Majed Shala.

The fruit shared was tested for alcohol content. The highest level found was the equivalent of 0.61% alcohol by volume (ABV).“Chimps don’t share food all the time, so this behaviour with fermented fruit might be important,” said Kimberley Hockings, also from the University of Exeter.Though the alcohol level is relatively low, the chimpanzees ate a lot of fruit every day so might ingest a fair quantity of alcohol, she said. “They can feed on kilograms of the stuff every day. It’s probably analogous to us sipping on a light beer.”Hockings and her colleagues published a paper in 2015 describing how chimpanzees in west Africastole and consumed palm sap alcohol created by humans. Some of them appeared to become troublesome, causing mischief such as not letting others build their night nests.The researchers behind the latest study, however, said chimpanzees were unlikely to get “drunk” on the breadfruit because it would not improve their survival chances.The sharing seemed to take place between all ages and sexes. Two adult females, nicknamed Chip and Até, were seen ignoring a larger hunk of breadfruit in favour of a smaller but fermented piece.Two adult males, Mandjambé and Gary, were observed approaching ripe breadfruit with aggressive stances. Mandjambé claimed a piece and began to feed, while another adult male, Bobby, kept Gary at bay. They all had a taste of the ripe breadfruit in the vicinity in the end.The paper, which appears in the journalCurrent Biologywith the title “Wild chimpanzees share fermented fruits”, asks the question: “Do the origins of feasting behaviour derive from a shared common ancestor?”Hockings said: “We need to find out more about whether the chimpanzees deliberately seek out ethanolic fruits and how they metabolise it, but this behaviour could be the early evolutionary stages of feasting. If so, it suggests the human tradition of feasting may have its origins deep in our evolutionary history.”She said the number of observations was small but they could lead to “an explosion” of research into the topic.Explore more on these topicsAnimal behaviourBiologyAnimalsGuinea-BissauAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

In a televised address, Saab claimed the Salvadorian’s “cynical” offer exposed him as a narcissistic “neo-Nazi” who had “kidnapped” more than 250 Venezuelan migrants sent to a maximum-security jail inEl Salvadorby the Trump administration since mid-March.“Bukele is a serial human rights violator,” Saab said, pointing to the politician’s “horrifying” three-year anti-gang crackdown, which has seen at least 85,000 Salvadoriansthrown in jail, largely without due process. Human rights activists say more than 360 prisoners have died.Some members of Venezuela’s opposition – reeling from its failure to dislodge Maduro, despite seemingly beating him in last July’s presidential election – welcomed Bukele’s offer. Leopoldo López, an exiled opposition leader who lives in Spain, said the idea had his “full support”. The opposition’s most important leader,María Corina Machado, made no immediate comment.However, many political and human rights activists have voiced perplexity and shock that the Venezuelan migrants being held in El Salvador – having been denied due process in the US and deported to an authoritarian foreign land – had become embroiled in the political tussle between strongman populists such as Trump, Bukele and Maduro.“The idea that there would be a [prisoner] trade should be loathsome to anyone who actually cares about human rights,” said Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at Chatham House.Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert from the Atlantic Council’s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, suspected the plight of the Venezuelans being held in El Salvador and Bukele’s prisoner swap “PR stunt” had potential benefits for both Bukele and Maduro.“Maduro’s quite happy to feud with Bukele and point to human rights abuses in El Salvador as a way of distracting from the brutal repression and violence of his own regime,” Ramsey said. According to the human rights group Foro Penal, Maduro’s jails currently house about 900 political prisoners. Thousands were imprisoned after last year’s election when Maduro, who has ruled since 2013, ordered acrackdownto stop his apparent victor, Edmundo González, from taking power.From Bukele’s perspective, offer was “a smart way of shifting the conversation away from concerns around the deportees being held in El Salvador back to the existence of political prisoners in Venezuela”, Ramsay said.For the migrants caught up in the geopolitical jailings, the consequences are calamitous. Many have not been convicted of any crime and it is unclear how long they will be held.‘I just ask God that he’s OK’: family of Venezuelan musician sent to El Salvador prison agonizes over his fateRead moreIn an interview last week, the wife of one Venezuelan prisoner, a singer called Arturo Suárez Trejo, lamented how the Venezuelan detainees seemed to have become part of a high-stakes game of chess. “And they are the pawns,” said Nathali Sánchez, rejecting claims that the father of her child was involved in crime. “It’s evil,” she added.The Trump administration’s targeting of Venezuelan migrants – who it has accused, largely without evidence, of being gang members and terrorists – has put Venezuela’s opposition in a difficult spot.Seemingly fearful of alienating Trump’s administration, its key leaders – including including Machado – have said little about the migration crackdown or the deportation of Venezuelan citizens to El Salvador. “[The opposition has] largely held its tongue on issues of the treatment of fellow citizens because of its larger goal of gaining the White House’s support for its preferred strategy [to defeat Maduro] and that also is reprehensible,” Sabatini said.Among the friends and families of the incarcerated migrants – many of them opposition supporters who fled Venezuela to escape Maduro’s regime – the opposition’s failure to defend them is causing anger and frustration.“The reality is that the Venezuelan opposition needs to have a good relationship with the White House, and they understand that they can’t be perceived as criticizing Trump,” said Ramsey. “But on the other hand, the general public in Venezuela is outraged at the situation faced by those who’ve been deported and sent to this maximum security jail in El Salvador. So it really puts the opposition in between a rock and a hard place.”Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaEl SalvadorDonald TrumpNicolás MaduroAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

SinceDonald Trumptook office, theadministrationhas emboldened immigration officers to arrest and deport undocumented people, including foreign students whose visas have been revoked, leading to a series of errors.US supreme court orders temporary halt to deportations of Venezuelan menRead more“Under the Trump administration’s theory of the law, the government could have banished this U.S. citizen to a Salvadoran prison then refused to do anything to bring him back,” Mark Joseph Stern, a legal analyst for Slate,wroteon Bluesky. “This is why the Constitution guarantees due process to all. Could it be more obvious?”During his campaign for the presidency, the US president promised to carry out “mass deportations”. In the three months since he took office, several foreign tourists have been wrongfully detained, federal agents from other agencies have been deputized to engage in immigration enforcement and Trump has invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, declaring that Venezuelan gang members are leading a foreign invasion of the United States to give himself the power to expel immigrants to a notorious Salvadorian prison.According to AZPM’s report, Hermosillo was visiting the Tucson area from Albuquerque, got lost without identification and was arrested by border patrol officials near its headquarters in Nogales. Hermosillo’s girlfriend’s family made numerous calls looking for him before they discovered he was being held atthe Florence correctional center, a privately run Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility. After his arrest, the court docket shows, he was temporarily detained in the custody of the US marshals.After the family tracked him down, they provided officials with his birth certificate and social security card.“He did say he was a US citizen, but they didn’t believe him,” Hermosillo’s girlfriend’s aunt told AZPM. “I think they would have kept him. I think they would have, if they would have not got that information yesterday in the court, and gave that to Ice and the border patrol. He probably would have been deported already toMexico.”Ice, Customs and Border Protection and Hermosillo’s attorney did not respond to requests for comment.But a senior official with the Department of Homeland Security rejected the allegations.“The narrative being pushed about Jose Hermosillo is false,” the official said via email. “On April 8, Hermosillo approached Border Patrol in Tucson and stated he had entered the U.S. illegally through Nogales. He said he wanted to turn himself in and completed a sworn statement identifying as a Mexican citizen who had entered unlawfully.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Afterward, he was held by the U.S. Marshals in Florence, AZ. A few days later, his family presented documents showing U.S. citizenship.

But immigration officials’ detention of citizens is not new, and it has taken place across presidential administrations. In 2021, the Government Accountability Officefoundthat from 2015 through 2020, Ice arrested 674 US citizens and deported 70 of them. And from 2007 through 2015, 818 US citizens were held in immigration detention,according to a 2016 analysisfrom NPR.In recent months, the Trump administration has revoked the visas of hundreds of foreign students, many for taking part in Gaza solidarity protests the administration call antisemitic . Among those swept up in that crackdown is Aditya Wahyu Harsono,an Indonesian student in Minnesota, who is married to a US citizen, arrested at his hospital workplace this month after his visa was secretly revoked.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationArizonaTrump administrationDonald TrumpNew MexicoMexicoUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The lawmakers are seeking to meet with Ábrego García, who had lived in the US for more than a decade before being swept up in a 15 March operation.“Even with all of the illegal actions we’ve seen over the last couple of months, I think this is the one that terrifies me the most when it comes to the future of our democracy,” Ansari told the Associated Press in an interview.Senator says trip to El Salvador was to support Kilmar Ábrego García’s due processRead moreAccording to a congressional aide familiar with the arrangements, the delegation will meet with officials at the US embassy on Tuesday morning to advocate for Ábrego García’s release and ask about other individuals transferred from the US who are currently detained inEl Salvador. The lawmakers will also receive classified briefings during their visit.The case has become a flashpoint in the ongoing tensions between theTrump administrationand the supreme court, which ruled that the government had a duty to help return Ábrego García. Justice department lawyers have argued that they lack the power to secure his release from foreign custody.Garcia, the representative fromCalifornia, said that Ábrego García deserved due process.“They’re trying to demonize him, and we’re not here to defend him. He deserves due process, and everyone deserves due process,” Garcia told the AP. “What he did or may have done, that has to be decided by a judge.”Ábrego García, who had protected legal status that should have prevented his deportation, was sent to El Salvador on a plane carrying alleged immigrant gang members. He is currently being held in a prison in El Salvador after being moved from the country’s Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot), which has drawn praise from Republican lawmakers but criticism from human rights advocates for inhumane conditions.The Trump administration admitted in court filings that “an administrative error” led to Ábrego García’s deportation to El Salvador – despite a 2019 immigration judge’s order protecting him – but the same officials say they will not return him to his American wife and disabled child in Maryland.The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt has defended the deportation, claiming Ábrego García was involved in human trafficking and terrorism, and said that if he were to return to the US, “he would immediately be deported again”.But the controversy has even drawn criticism from some Republicans, with Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana acknowledging on NBC’s Meet the Press that “the administration won’t admit it. But this was a screw-up.”As minority party members in both chambers of Congress,Democratshave limited leverage over the administration but are still determined on maintaining public pressure. Ansari indicated that more Democratic lawmakers plan to visit El Salvador in the coming weeks, saying: “This is about the future of our democracy and the future of due process as American citizens.”Ábrego GarcÍa’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, said in a statement on Monday that the lawmakers’ visit “sends a powerful message”.“We’re deeply grateful to the members of Congress and advocates for justice now on the ground in El Salvador, building on the leadership of Senator Van Hollen,” she said in the statement, according to NBC News.During a news conference from El Salvador on Monday afternoon, Frost told reporters that “due process applies to all people in our country”.“We demand the release of Ábrego García,” Frost said. “We’re also worried about our own constituents.”Frost added that the representatives had requested to see Ábrego García on Monday but that the request was denied by the Salvadorian government as it was not an official trip.Ansari added that the delegation met with the US embassy in El Salvador on Monday morning, and that they didn’t hear anything that gave her reason “to believe that the Trump administration is doing anything to facilitate his safe return home”.Kilmar Ábrego García ‘traumatized’ by threats in prison, Maryland senator saysRead more“And that is simply unacceptable,” she said, noting that they had just sent a letter to the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, “demanding daily proof of life” from Ábrego García, that he has access to counsel, and that the administration return him to the US.Ansari said that this “isn’t just about Kilmar, it is the fact that our government is relentlessly going after any immigrants trying to come to the US, or in in US, without any regard for due process”.“They have not been convicted of a crime, they should not be imprisoned here,” she said.This article was amended on 21 April 2025 to say that Kilmar Ábrego García is now being held in a Salvadorian prison and no longer in Cecot.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsEl SalvadorTrump administrationDemocratsArizonaOregonFloridanewsShareReuse this content"

At the time, the country’s prime minister, Dickon Mitchell, described the destruction as “almost Armageddon-like”. On the small island ofCarriacou, it was estimated by officials that more than 90% of the buildings were damaged or destroyed. Agriculture and infrastructure for electricity and communication were almost completely wiped out.Nearly a year on, there are some signs of recovery and rebuilding, but hollowed-out buildings, roofless houses and charred, dying mangroves tell the story of a community that is still coming to grips with the devastation.Some people are still living in tents. Artists Michael Alexander and Yolanda VendenDunden pitched theirs on the foundations of one of the many houses demolished by the hurricane.VendenDunden had just moved to the island from the Netherlands when authorities announced Beryl was coming. The artists say the hurricane was much worse than they expected.View image in fullscreenYolanda VendenDunden and Michael Alexander with their tent on Carriacou in Grenada.Photograph: Haron Forteau/The Guardian“The roof started to shake, and the walls caved in. Yolanda passed out,” said Alexander.They survived, but they lost their home and many of their possessions. Suddenly homeless, they decided to live in the tent, with a makeshift bathroom and kitchen beside it. “I built up back the kitchen and bathroom from the pieces of the house and blocked it off so the lady could get privacy. And we sleep in the tent,” said Alexander.The tent gives them some privacy, but it gives them no refuge from the oppressive heat. And local farmers say that heat is causing droughts which are worse every year.Gifford Andrew, a farmer on Carriacou, said the combination of hurricanes and water shortages makes farming extremely challenging.View image in fullscreenGifford Andrew at his farm on Carriacou.Photograph: Haron Forteau/The Guardian“I lost everything in Beryl. Now I’m trying to put the pieces back together, but I have to deal with the drought. Every single year it’s worse, and it means a lot more water is needed to water my plot. It’s really hard,” he said.The triple whammy of hurricanes, drought and coastal erosion makes the island one of the starkest examples ofclimate crisischallenges, said the Carriacou government official and environmentalist Davon Baker. “The impact of climate change has been pretty severe. In addition to hurricanes, we are losing a lot of beach space to rising sea levels, and we are having extreme and intense dry seasons, which affect our farming and ability to produce food,” he said.From foul to fuel: how a seaweed problem could power the CaribbeanRead moreIn the face of these serious and multiple climate crisis-related threats, Grenada’s prime minister has been advocating for more support from rich countries, which he said had built their wealth by polluting the planet. Grenada last year joined other vulnerable countries ina landmark case at the international court of justicewhich seeks to hold polluting countries accountable for their roles in the climate crisis.At the same time as that push for climate accountability, Caribbean leaders have been stepping up their pursuit of reparatory justice over the centuries-long transatlantic slave trade, which saw more than 12.5 million Africans kidnapped, forcibly transported to theAmericasand sold into slavery. They argue that enslavement and colonisation are still having detrimental impacts on their countries’ social and economic development.Now some in the reparations movement are arguing that the two efforts are part of the same struggle. Arley Gill, the head of theGrenadaReparations Commission, has pointed said there was an “inescapable” link between the pursuit of justice for enslavement and justice for climate change.View image in fullscreenA boat graveyard in Dumfries on Carriacou.Photograph: Haron Forteau/The GuardianGill argues that the Industrial Revolution is linked to both slavery and the climate crisis and that the Caribbean’s underdevelopment – itself a legacy of colonialism and enslavement – hampers the region’s ability to deal with the effects of the climate crisis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

And the Industrial Revolution in Europe was fueled by the Atlantic slave trade and slavery. Black people were enslaved in the Caribbean to export cotton and sugar. These raw materials – which were then refined in the factories in Europe and consumed in Europe and sold all over the world – came from the very crimes of humanity which we speak of and for which we claim reparative justice. So that there is an inevitable link between reparative justice and climate change.”View image in fullscreenTevin Andrews, the minister for Carriacou and Petite Martinique, on Carriacou in Grenada.Photograph: Haron Forteau/The GuardianHe added: “More than that, the harm which was caused by the Atlantic slave trade and slavery created a vulnerable environment in the Caribbean. In other words, we lack the resources to address the effects of climate change – and the reason we lack the resources is partly or mostly due to underdevelopment, which was caused by the Atlantic slave trade.”For people in Carriacou who are suffering the ill effects of the climate crisis, the issue has become a matter of survival.On the Grenadian island of Carriacou, even the dead are now climate victimsRead moreSitting in his office in Carriacou, Tevin Andrews, the minister for Carriacou and Petite Martinique, described how he lost a close friend to Beryl.The island, he said, was surviving on hopes and prayers.“Every single year from July to December, we have to, as we say it in the Caribbean,‘ban our belly’ and pray to our God, hoping that nothing strikes us. So we know, first-hand, the experience of climate change, the rising temperature, the rise in sea levels and the devastation that is caused by hurricanes,” he said.Criticising the slow pace of action on the climate crisis and reparations, Andrews said rich countries “built their wealth on our backs, from our hard work and left us high and dry with no infrastructure, with no educational infrastructure”.The lack of engagement and action by richer countries and former colonisers “sends a clear message that really and truly they don’t care about us”, he said.“Their actions have us where we are. And we are going to continue to suffer. We are going to continue to get strong hurricanes. We are going to continue to lose our shorelines. Our islands will disappear.”Explore more on these topicsGrenadaHurricanesClimate crisisSlaveryInfrastructureCaribbeanAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After three years, judges in Loreto, Peru’s largest Amazon region, ruled in March 2024 that the Marañon had the right to be free-flowing and free of contamination, respecting anIndigenous worldview that regards a river as a living entity.It was a landmark ruling inPeru. The court in Iquitos, Loreto’s capital city, found the Peruvian government had violated the river’s inherent rights, and ordered it to take immediate action to prevent future oil spills into the waterway. The court also ruled that the government must mandate the creation of a protection plan for the entire river basin and recognise the Kukama community as its stewards. The government appealed against the decision, but the court upheld the ruling in October 2024.“She is the ‘mother of rivers’, the Marañon is born in the Andes and flows downstream to become the Amazon River,” Canaquiri said. The Kukama believe the river is sacred and that their ancestors’ spirits reside in its bed. for four decades, however, the Kukama have endured scores of oil spills which destroy fish stocks, damage the ecosystem and contaminate the water with heavy metals.View image in fullscreenThe village of Shapajila on the Marañon River.Photograph: Goldman Environmental PrizeThe Peruvian state oil company Petroperú began building the theNorthern Peruvian pipelinein 1970s, and the region around the Marañon River has accounted for 40% of the county’s oil production since 2014 – with devastating effects. There have been more than 60 oil spills along the river since 1997, some of them catastrophic.“My grandparents taught me that there is a giant boa that lives in the river,Puragua, the ‘mother of the river’,”said Canaquiri. The spirit represents the health of the river and its personhood, according to the Kukama’s cosmovision.In practical terms, the Kukama depend on the river for transport, agriculture, water and fish, which is their main protein source. As a result of the the oil drilling, however, they have become highly vulnerable to water contamination.Local people have suffered from fevers, diarrhoea, skin rashes and miscarriages after oil spills, and elevated levels of lead, mercury, arsenic and cadmium were found in the blood of river community members in a2021 study.Canaquiri, a mother of four with six grandchildren, remembers a blissful childhood with abundant fish and animals before the oil drilling began. “There was plenty of food. We shared everything, worked on each other’s farms and celebrated the festivals together,” she said.View image in fullscreenMari Luz Canaquiri Murayari out on the river with members of her community.Photograph: Goldman Environmental PrizeDespite the ruling, the river is not out of danger and Canaquiri and the HKK are asking the Peruvian government to implement the court’s ruling.

The law prevents civil society organisations from taking legal action or even giving legal counsel in cases against the state over human rights abuses.Canaquiri says the law could cripple their legal battle. “It is worrying because it means lawyers cannot take our cases to enforce our fundamental rights,” she said.“It is not just for us, it is also for the country and the world. Who can live without breathing? If it wasn’t for the Amazon, the forest, the rivers, we wouldn’t have clean air to breathe. How would we get food to eat every day, our fruits, our vegetables, our animals, our fish?”She says she and the HKK are motivated by the future of their children and grandchildren,: “The government needs to understand that it should not kill nature but protect it.

It followed the arrival in the US on Sunday of another 737 Maxpainted in the livery of China’s Xiamen Airlinesat Boeing’s US production hub in Seattle.Boeing’s share price fell by nearly 3% on Monday, in line with a sell-off across Wall Street. US stock markets have been hit with much higher volatility this month as investors have tried to work out the effects of Trump’s tariffs.The aviation industry has been caught up in the trade war. Trump’s tariffs on goods from almost all countries have caused disruption across the world, but trade in goods between the US and China has been most affected, with levies of 145% on US imports and125% on goods going the other way.A new 737 Max has a market value of about $55m (£41.4m), according to IBA, an aviation consultancy. That makes a 125% tariff prohibitive without significantly changing the business model of the airline business.The return of the Boeing jets underlines the vulnerability to tariffs of the US’s biggest manufacturing exporter. It adds to Boeing’s problems just as it was trying to recover from a mid-air door panel blowout in January 2024 that prompted the company to replace its chief executive.Kelly Ortberg, whotook over Boeing after the safety crisis, will reveal the company’s first-quarter financial results on Wednesday. Analysts expect a significant improvement in sales compared with a year earlier, with revenues forecast to have risen 20% to $19.8bn, although they still expect losses of $466m for the quarter.However, the results are likely to be overshadowed by questions over the effect of tariffs on the business.Douglas Harned, an analyst at Bernstein, a research company, said he did not expect “definitive answers” on the tariff hit but was “concerned that risks are larger than expected” given airlines’ discomfort with paying tariffs, and possible delays to production to try to avoid levies.Harned said the pause on Chinese deliveries could hit cash generation in 2025, although he added that he expected the planes to be delivered eventually.Yet investors are having to contend with huge uncertainty over the White House’s intentions. Trump’s current policy is to raise tariffs on many countries after the end of a90-day “pause” on higher rates that excluded China, announced by the US president after market turmoil spread to the bond market.Richard Aboulafia, the managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, a consultancy, said theTrump administrationhad showed a “profound and hard-earned level of ignorance” of how the aerospace industry works, and that long-term tariffs would be damaging for Boeing.Aboulafia said the short-term hit to Boeing’s cash should be relatively limited but added that the company should push back hard against Trump’s tariffs, particularly to avoid a “catastrophic trade war with the rest of the world”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Chinese airlines are expected to account for as much as a fifth of new aircraft sales in one of the key markets for Boeing and its European rival Airbus. “You can’t just leave that to Airbus,” Aboulafia said.In a sign that the trade war could intensify beyond the US-China relationship, on Monday, Beijing warned it wouldtake “resolute and reciprocal” countermeasuresagainst other countries negotiating with the US if they made a deal at China’s expense.However, the rest of the world’s aviation industry may be less likely to be affected by countermeasures, given China’s reliance on US and European planes.Reuters reported that the 737 Max 8 landed in the US territory of Guam on Monday, after leaving Boeing’s Zhoushan completion centre near Shanghai, data from the flight-tracking website AirNav Radar showed.A spokesperson for Xiamen Airlines on Monday confirmed to Reuters that two planes marked for the carrier had gone to the US but declined to provide a reason.Boeing was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsBoeingTrump tariffsAerospace industryChinaAirline industryDonald TrumpTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

He finished his letter “you have no cards” – pointedly quoting Donald Trump’s Oval Office upbraiding of Ukraine’s President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterAt a press conference on Monday morning, Albanese was again asked about reports – first published last week by the defence news websiteJanes– that Russia had filed an official request with Indonesia for permission for its military aircraftto be based out of an airbase on the island of Biak, in Indonesia’s easternmost Papua province. Biak is a little more than 1,300km from Darwin.The Australian government’s position has been that there is “no prospect” of a Russian military base being established on Indonesian soil, a position reaffirmed by the Indonesian government.“I’m anti-Russia,” Albanese said on Monday. “I’m not sure that everyone is on that page, but I think that Russia has very different values under an authoritarian leader.“I have no wish to help promote Russia’s propaganda messages and I would suggest that that is not in Australia’s national interest either.”The Russians aren’t coming: Peter Dutton’s poor judgment distracts from Australia’s rare geopolitical opportunity | Allan BehmRead moreLast week an Indonesian foreign ministry spokesperson, Rolliansyah Soemirat, said the government had not granted permission to any country to establish a military base on its territory. His statement did not mention if Russian had made a request.The domestic political debate in Australia has focused not on Indonesia’s repudiation of the prospect of the Russian aircraft being based in Indonesia but rather on whether Moscow made the request.The Australian government last week dismissed demands from the opposition for a security briefing on the reported Russian request, arguing that there was no critical or imminent decision that required consultation with the opposition under caretaker conventions.But the opposition leader,Peter Dutton, said government ministers had obfuscated, given inconsistent statements, and repeatedly refused to answer questions on the reported Russian request.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That seems strange.“We have asked for a briefing. It’s still not forthcoming from the government. What do they have to hide? I wish this prime minister could be open and honest with the Australian people.”In a significant campaign misstep last week, Dutton said it would be a “catastrophic failure of diplomatic relations” by the Labor government if it had not received notice of any Russian request before it was “publicly announced by the president of Indonesia”. He wasforced to later concedethat the Indonesian president had made no statement on the issue.Again on Monday, Albanese dismissed opposition demands for a briefing as unjustified, saying there was no prospect of a Russian base about which to brief.“I’m waiting for them [the opposition] to ask for a briefing on who faked the moon landing.”Indonesia’s new president,Prabowo Subianto, is far more internationally oriented than his predecessor, Joko Widodo, and, while he has repeatedly asserted Jakarta’s continued commitment to anon-aligned foreign policy, his actions have been seen as undermining that neutrality.Prabowo swiftly signed his nation on to the China- and Russia-led Brics developing nations group after his October inauguration, and has strengthened ties with Russia. He visited Russia’s President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last July – having won the election but before taking office – and will return in June this year as president.In November Indonesia and Russia conducted bilateral naval drills for the first time, undertaking exercises in Indonesian waters, in the Java Sea, near Surabaya. In the same month, Indonesia conducted military drills with Australia.Explore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyAustralian election 2025Anthony AlbaneseIndonesiaRussiaPeter DuttonCoalitionnewsShareReuse this content"

Whistleblowers should be protected, not punished.”Animals Australia, an animal protection organisation, said it had been approached by whistleblowers who were fearful of repercussions for speaking out about welfare issues.“There must be stronger protections for whistleblowers,” Animals Australia’s legal counsel Shatha Hamade said. “Vets with professional and ethical integrity are being forced out of the system.”The agriculture department has rejected the allegations that its oversight of export abattoirs is compromised.

What happens is people borrow more because they factor in the tax deduction,” Fotheringham says.“It is absolutely inflationary.

His gave freely of his gifts and had a unique personal approach to all he met.”“Pope Francis was a Pope of peace. In a world devastated by war he called for peace and justice. I am grateful for the late Holy Father’s frequent appeals for a just peace in Ukraine and for the efforts of the Holy See that he oversaw, known and secret, that in some way helped bring relief to the imprisoned and suffering.”Bychok is the Catholic church’s youngest cardinal and the first Australian to be made cardinal since George Pell. He is also just the eighth cardinal from Australia.He will be one of about 135 cardinals from around the world eligible to take part in the conclave.“I also ask for your prayers for the Cardinal Electors that will be meeting in Conclave, that the Holy Spirit may enlighten our hearts and minds that we may choose a worthy candidate as the 267th Bishop of Rome and Successor of Saint Peter,” Bychok said.Conclave: the Vatican’s secret process for choosing a new popeRead moreBychok was born in the Ukrainian city of Ternopil, and entered a monastery after finishing high school, before becoming ordained as a priest in Lviv.He served as a priest in several countries including in Poland and the US, before moving toMelbournein January 2020 to serve as the Eparchy of Saints Peter and Paul of Melbourne, a Ukrainian Greek Catholic church.“He felt a calling to follow Christ at the age of 15, when he was in 9th grade,” a biography on his church’s website said.As a cardinal under the age of 80, Bychok will be one of the select few Catholic leaders who will gather in the Vatican in the coming weeks to vote in the papal conclave to choose the next pope.Pope Francis installed Bychok as a cardinal over other well-known Catholic leaders in Australia, such as the archbishop of Sydney, Anthony Fisher and his Melbourne counterpart, Peter Comensoli.At a ceremony at the Vatican in December when he was installed as a cardinal, Bychok said Francis spoke to him in Ukrainian when telling him “glory be to Jesus Christ”.“It was very a great moment for me, of support,” Bychok told the ABC.View image in fullscreenCardinal Mykola Bychok receives the biretta hat from Pope Francis during a consistory for the creation of new cardinals at the Vatican in December.Photograph: Alessandra Benedetti/Corbis/Getty ImagesHis installation as cardinal was celebrated by Catholics both in Australia and Ukraine.Bychok has spoken out about the plight of his native Ukraine since Russia’s 2022 invasion.“It is really a genocide of our people because Russia is in war mode, with army, with soldiers, and they are killing our people,” he told the ABC.Pope Francis: outsider whose reforming mission made him an ally of progressivesRead moreIn an Easter letter sent to congregants last week, Bychok urged Catholics who find themselves “in a world that often feels overwhelmed by uncertainty, suffering and division” to seek comfort from God.“We cannot celebrate [Easter] this year without turning our thoughts and prayers to our suffering homeland of Ukraine. The war continues to bring devastation, pain, and heartbreak,” he wrote.“Yet even here, in the shadow of the cross, we cling to the promise of the empty tomb. We live in hope that this unjust aggression will be brought to an end, and that a just and lasting peace will be established. As Pope Saint John Paul II once said, ‘Do not abandon yourselves to despair’.”He called for this Easter to bring “a new beginning”.“Let us rise with Christ in our hearts, ready to witness to the world that love is stronger than hate, that mercy is stronger than vengeance, and that life is stronger than death,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisCatholicismVictoriaMelbourneThe papacyChristianitynewsShareReuse this content"

He looked frail, and struggled to speak. His brief Easter message, which was read aloud on the balcony by an aide, reiterated his call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.The next morning, Francis, 88, was dead.“I was so caught up in the moment that I didn’t think of his illness,” said Nicoletti, who returned to St Peter’s Square to pay his respects on Monday. “Then when my daughter called me this morning to say he had died, I was very surprised. To me it feels like it was a divine intervention – God wanted him to live until Easter, and then he left. It was a joyous day. I now feel sad but also moved to be here for his historic moment for the [Catholic] faith.”Francisdied on Mondaymorning. The pope’s remains will be transferred to St Peter’s Basilica on Wednesday, when the public will be able to pay tribute.As of Monday night, the date of his funeral had not been announced but papal funerals usually take place between four and six days after death. The canonisation ofthe Catholic church’s first millennial saint, Carlo Acutis, which had been scheduled for 27 April, has been suspended.Nicoletti, who also saw Franciswhen he visited Philadelphia in 2015, was among the thousands of pilgrims and tourists mourning the pope at St Peter’s Square. At around midday, the bells of the basilica rang out and the square fell almost silent.Father Jacopo Aprico was visiting Rome with a group of schoolchildren from Milan. They heard the news that the pope had died when they were on the train. “His death was expected because he had been so ill, but we were still surprised,” said Aprico. “He was only in this square yesterday. It is sad – you can never be prepared for someone’s death, regardless of how old or ill they might be.”Wilder Herrera was in Rome with his girlfriend, both from Colombia. He recalled seeing Francis, originally from Argentina, when he visited his hometown, close to Bogotá, in 2017. “We wanted to pay our respects,” said Herrera. “Francis was a great pope, someone who was very humble and close to the people.”Alice and her family were in Rome for the Easter weekend from Catania in Sicily. “It feels as if he wanted to wait for Easter Sunday to give his blessing and say goodbye,” she said. “Then he left us for heaven.”Francis, who almost died twice during his five-week hospitalisation, was discharged from Rome’s Gemelli hospital on 23 March and ordered by doctors to rest at home for at least two months. Although his official work duties were vastly scaled back, he madeseveral appearancesin recent weeks, the most daring being a visit to St Peter’s Basilica to thank the restorers finishing the restoration of the 17th century tomb of Pope Urban VIII.He alsoprivately metKing Charles and Queen Camilla during their recent state visit to Italy and on Maundy Thursday kept up the tradition of visiting inmates at Rome’s Regina Coeli prison.One of the last people to see him was the US vice-president, JD Vance, who was in the Italian capital for the Easter weekend andmet Francison Sunday morning, an encounter that was not previously scheduled.Francis hadalways pushed the limits throughout his 12-year papacy, so it was not surprising that he ventured out despite still being ill.He had embarked on more than 40 overseas trips during his time as pontiff, the longest and most arduous one being his four-country tour of Asia last September. His final overseas trip was to Corsica in December. Later that month he opened the Catholic Jubilee, a special year of forgiveness and reconciliation during which millions will travel to Rome. He maintained an intense schedule before being hospitalised in mid-February.Conclave: the Vatican’s secret process for choosing a new popeRead moreFrancis simplified rites for papal funerals last year and previously said he had already planned his tomb in the basilica Santa Maria Maggiore in the Esquilino neighbourhood in Rome, where he went to pray before and after trips overseas. Popes are usually buried with much fanfare in the grottoes beneath St Peter’s Basilica inVatican City.Amid intense mourning over the coming days and weeks, manoeuvring within theVaticanover who will succeed Francis will begin. A conclave must get under way within 20 days of the pope’s death.Mourners in St Peter’s Square are also contemplating his successor. “I hope the next pope will be a continuation of Francis’ papacy,” said Nicoletti.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisCatholicismThe papacyReligionChristianityVaticanItalynewsShareReuse this content"

It recently announced that it planned to increase its international appeal by launching direct flights from the UK.But many who visited last week said they should not have been charged full price because the conditions were unsuitable. “We’ve been here for a week now and we’ve been skiing for half a day, because there’s so much water and stuff,” Emelie Åkerstrand told the Swedish public broadcaster, SVT. Others complained their equipment had been destroyed by the conditions.Despite lifts and slopes being closed, visitors said they were still charged full price. “Where we went there was slush. We got stuck in puddles,” Filippa Fjällbäck told the Dagens Nyheter newspaper. Martin Isaacs added: “Despite the lack of skiable slopes, we had to pay full price. It feels wrong.”View image in fullscreenSome visitors complained that skiing through slush and water had damaged their equipment.Photograph: Martin IsaacsSkiStar said it had upheld its “snow guarantee”. “We have colleagues in the industry where some are offering lift passes and some have discounts. I can guess that it has to do with the snow guarantee and the ability to not achieve it and fulfil it, which we do with gusto,” said Anders Bjernulf, the destination manager at SkiStar Sälen.Global heating and increasingly unpredictable shorter winters have led to problems across Europe as ski resorts struggle to maintain the right conditions. In October, the French alpine ski resort Alpe du Grand Serre in Isèrewas forced to closebecause it could not afford to become a year-round destination to offset its shorter winter season.Others – including in Finland, Norway and Switzerland – are usingpurpose-built matsmade of extruded polystyrene, a material used for home insulation across the Nordics, to preserve snow.The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute reported the whole country was between 0.5 and 2C warmer this winter than the normal temperature between 1991 and 2020. The biggest difference was in the mountains of northern Lapland, where temperatures were about 4C higher than normal.Sofie Arnell, SkiStar’s chief legal officer, said: “Before purchasing a SkiPass, the customer takes note of our terms and conditions (including information about the snow guarantee and the possibility of rebooking or cancelling the SkiPass). This is also stated in the customer’s booking confirmation.“The customer always has the option to cancel the SkiPass with a full refund up until the first day of validity of the SkiPass. Open lifts and slopes are listed on our website and in our app. This information is updated several times a day.”Explore more on these topicsSki resortsSwedenSkiing holidaysEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The thieves escaped with up to an estimated €10m in jewellery.At the time of the robbery, Kardashian was without security protection and sitting alone in her bedroom at an exclusive apartment building in centralParis, known as a “no address” site, where celebrities visiting Paris often rent sumptuous suites.Her bodyguard had instead accompanied her sister, the fellow reality TV star Kourtney Kardashian, to a Paris nightclub after the sisters had spent the day at major Paris fashion shows being photographed.Kardashian, 44, a billionaire celebrity influencer and business owner, later told the TV interviewer David Letterman she had feared she would be raped and murdered during the heist. She said of one of the burglars: “I saw him have a gun out for me, and I was like, OK, this is it. I kept on thinking about Kourtney, I kept on thinking she’s going to come home and I’m going to be dead in the room and she’s going to be traumatised for the rest of her life if she sees me … I thought that was my fate.”At that time, Kardashian routinely posted most of her daily movements and whereabouts on social media, where she also displayed her jewellery, including a large 18.88-carat diamond engagement ring given to her by her then husband, the rapperKanye West, which was estimated to be worth $4m. Those details on social media may have facilitated the thieves’ targeting of her.Kardashian later told a Forbes Power Women’s Summit the thieves had followed her movements on social media. “They knew my every move and what I had.” She said it had changed her approach to what she posted.Kardashian, who is now acriminal justice advocatein the US, will travel to give evidence at the Paris trial, which runs from 28 April to 23 May.A group of five armed men, all aged over 60, are alleged to have arrived by bicycle or on foot and impersonated police officers to enter the building just after 2am.After allegedly holding the concierge at gunpoint, they went to Kardashian’s apartment, where one man pulled a gun on her. Kardashian told police that the man spoke in “a very strong French accent” in English, telling her to hand over her diamond engagement ring. She was held at gunpoint, her arms and feet were tied and her mouth was taped. The men then fled the room in less than 10 minutes taking the ring and other jewels.Ten people will go on trial in Paris in connection with the heist, on charges including armed robbery, membership of a criminal gang, and kidnapping – which refers to Kardashian being held hostage at gunpoint. Eight deny any involvement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He told TF1 TV inFranceon Sunday: “We were all grandads.” He said he had previously served 20 years in prison for robbery, had been out of prison for 10 years and was struggling to make ends meet. “I had a proposal for a big job, which would be my last … They told me there was a 20-carat diamond that wasn’t protected … That was tempting.”He said that, at the time, he had not known who they were robbing. “I was told it was the wife of a rapper. I didn’t ask questions.”He said: “I see her as a victim; we had nothing against her personally.”Aomar Ait Khedache, known as “Old Omar”, 68,has also admitted participating in the heist but denies the prosecution’s accusation that he was the ringleader.Of the 12 people originally charged over the robbery, only 10 will be present at the trial after one suspect died and another – Pierre Bouianere, 80 – was declared unable to participate in proceedings for health reasons. He will be tried separately.Most of the jewels were never recovered. At least one item was dropped by the thieves while escaping – a diamond-encrusted cross worth €30,000, which was found by a passerby as she went to work the next morning and handed to police.Explore more on these topicsKim KardashianParisFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It was the latest collaboration between rightwing US figures and McGregor, whom Donald Trumphosted at the White Houseon St Patrick’s Day.The Freemasons’ Hall, built in 1869, provided an elaborate, Victorian backdrop to the interview. In astatementat the weekend, Daley said the Freemasons routinely rented out the hall and took a booking from a US media company without initially knowing details of the event.“If the participants and content had been known the booking would not have been accepted. The Freemasons ofIrelandcategorically denies any association with the interviewer or interviewee and regrets that such an interview took place on our premises. We apologise to our members and confirm that steps have been taken to avoid a reoccurrence.”Daleytold RTÉthat the organisation learned details of the event about an hour before it took place. “When it came to my attention, I then debated with some of my colleagues. Would we cancel it or would we let it go ahead? And we decided in our wisdom that we just let it go,” he said.Daley said he allowed the interview to proceed after an assurance from Carlson’s company that all of the backgrounds would be blurred and that there would be no reference to the Freemasons’ Hall.Daley also said his organisation worried about a possible “backlash” if it cancelled the event. “In hindsight we’re not happy with that decision, I mean, look, we made a mistake, put my hands up, fully admit that.”Daley added: “I would not be a fan of Mr McGregor under any circumstances.” The fee, said to be between €1,000-€2,000, is to be donated to charity.In the interview, McGregor, said a corrupt governing elite was facilitating the “erasure” of Irish people and their identity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These included 16 women, 14 men, two girls and two males whose age was not reported.Thirty-seven suspects in the direct assaults on people were identified, 11 of whom were known to police. Authorities reported no concrete leads in the attacks on refugee shelters.Jian Omar, the other Green deputy who sought the publication of the statistics, called the report an “alarm bell”.“We demand a clear protection plan for refugees, a visible police presence at endangered residences, comprehensive prevention work and above all policies that clearly recognise rightwing violence and decisively fight it,” he said.Berlin has about 35,000 registered refugees in official reception centres and dormitories and a further 10,000 in emergency shelters, for example at the former Tegel and Tempelhof airports, where conditions have been often criticised as substandard and overcrowded.Officials from the state office for refugee affairs (LAF) told local media that all of its residences had plans in place to prevent violence, including round-the-clock security personnel at most facilities.Earlier this month, LAF reported a steep drop in the number of new arrivals in Berlin to 1,761 people in January and February, down more than 35% on the same period in 2024amid a decline across the European Union. Most arrivals in the German capital came from Vietnam, Moldova, Afghanistan, Turkey and Syria.Ukrainians, who are exempt from German asylum application requirements, also arrived in smaller numbers during the first two months of 2025, at 1,722. In January and February 2024, 2,611 Ukrainian citizens fleeing the Russian invasion sought refuge in Berlin.The figures mirror anational trend reported by the interior ministryin February revealing 218 “politically motivated” assaults on refugee shelters last year based on preliminary data, compared with 167 cases in 2023.Federal statistics on crimes against individual asylum seekers, however, showed a decline last year to 1,905, down from 2,488 in 2023 – the highest number since the 2016 refugee influx under the then chancellor,Angela Merkel.Clara Bünger, an MP for the far-left Linke party, which filed the request for the data, said the government needed to treat the problem urgently.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We must never simply get used to that.”In the town of Stahnsdorf, south-west of Berlin, in March, seven rightwing extremists allegedly tried to violently gain entry to a refugee shelter. When they were confronted by a security guard, they reportedly beat him, leaving him unconscious. Witnesses said that before the assault they heard a group outside the building chanting far-right slogans.German authorities recorded a jump in rightwing extremist crimes last year of more than 17%, with 33,963 reported offences until the end of November 2024 including 1,136 violent attacks. Annual figures will be released next month.The anti-immigration hard-rightAlternative für Deutschlandparty made strong gains in the February snap election to win more than 20% of the vote. It is now the strongest opposition force in parliament, fuelled bygrowing voter anxiety over immigration, particularly following aseries of violent attacksblamed on asylum seekers.The Conservative leader,Friedrich Merz, who is due to be sworn in as chancellor on 6 May, campaigned on dramatically tightening border policy and bringing irregular immigration to a halt, afterstricter measures already undertaken by the centre-left-led predecessor government.Acoalition deal with the centre-left Social Democratsreached this month watered down many of Merz’s stated aims, but laid out a range of tougher proposals including suspending family reunification for many refugees, coordinating with neighbour countries to stop asylum seekers at the frontier, and implementing plans for deportations to previously excluded countries such as Syria and Afghanistan.Explore more on these topicsGermanyFar rightEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Trump called the defense secretary on Sunday after the story broke and aides concluded that it had been leaked to the news media by a former Hegseth aide who was in the group chat but abruptly fired last week.Trump has resisted firing top officials in his second term, not wanting to be seen as caving to a media swarm even if he has been unhappy with the negative coverage. Trump alsostuck by his national security adviser, Mike Waltz, who had added the editor of the Atlantic to the first chat.According to a person familiar with the call, Trump told Hegseth that he had his support and that disgruntled leakers were to blame for the story, which was first reported by the New York Times.Trump also told his team to back Hegseth in public, and senior Trump aides repeated their defense line that none of the information shared in either of the group chats were classified, although the accusations have centered on why it was shared with Hegseth’s wife, for instance, since she is not a Pentagon official.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Sunday, it said an internal investigation had “identified several professional failures, breaches of orders, and a failure to fully report the incident”.Gaza’s civil defence agency, which rescues victims of airstrikes, dismissed the Israeli army report, accusing the military of lying in an attempt to justify targeting the rescue convoys.“The video filmed by one of the paramedics proves that the Israeli occupation’s narrative is false and demonstrates that it carried out summary executions,” Mohammed al-Mughair, a civil defence official, told Agence-France Presse on Monday, accusing Israel of seeking to “circumvent” its obligations under international law.Jonathan Whittall, the UN’s humanitarian chief for Gaza, said the investigation did not go far enough. “A lack of real accountability undermines international law and makes the world a more dangerous place,” he said.“Without accountability, we risk continuing to watch atrocities unfolding, and the norms designed to protect us all eroding.”Nebal Farsakh, a spokesperson for the PRCS, said: “The report is full of lies. It is invalid and unacceptable, as it justifies the killing and shifts responsibility to a personal error in the field command when the truth is quite different.”The PRCS has previously called for an international investigation into the incident.Sunday’s IDF report said the deputy commander of the Golani Brigade would be dismissed owing to his responsibilities in the field and for “providing an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief”. Another commander, whose unit was also operating in the area, would be disciplined for “his overall responsibility for the incident”, the military said.According to the IDF, soldiers fired on the humanitarian workers travelling in ambulances and a fire truck because of “poor night visibility” and soldiers then violated orders by shooting at a UN vehicle which drove past 15 minutes later, resulting in the death of the driver.The bodies and vehicles were put in a sandy mass grave that could not be accessed by a UN retrieval team until several days later, after which the UN said the medics had been killed “one by one” and two witnesses claimed at least one victim had his hands and feet bound.Postmortem results released last weekshowed that the men were mostly killed by “gunshots to the head and torso”as well as injuries caused by explosives, and none of the victims had visible signs of restraint.The army denied in its report that there had been “indiscriminate fire” and maintained that six of the killed men were Hamas militants, allegations the humanitarian agencies involved deny. None of those killed were armed.During 18 months of war, Israeli forces have killed hundreds of medical workers and the staff of aid agencies and UN organisations in Gaza. In April last year, seven members of the charity World Central Kitchen died in a sustained Israeli attack on their clearly marked vehicles.Human rights organisations have long accused the Israeli military of a culture of impunity, with few soldiers ever facing justice. In 2023, fewer than 1% of complaints made against Israeli troops in the occupiedPalestinian territoriesended in a conviction, according to the latest US state department annual human rights report.Dan Owen, a researcher who analyses army data for the Israeli human rights organisation Yesh Din, said the vast majority of incidents go unreported.Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave in Gaza. This must never happen again | Jagan ChapagainRead moreThe IDF is yet to respond to a Yesh Din request made in June 2024 under freedom of information laws regarding the number of investigations and indictments in cases in which soldiers are suspected of harming civilians in the war in Gaza.In August last year, the military said it had received approximately 1,000 complaints filed by lawyers and human rights groups related to the Gaza war, and had opened 74 investigations. Four concerned the deaths of Palestinians held in Israeli detention, eight concerned allegations of torture in prisons, and the rest were related to property damage and theft.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

On Monday, Bar submitted an 31-page affidavit to the supreme court, which halted his firing last month. The affidavit detailed his version of the events that led to the breakdown of his relationship with Netanyahu and his dismissal. Some sections relating to national security were kept classified.Among the most serious allegations made in Bar’s affidavit was the claim that “on several occasions” Netanyahu explicitly told Shin Bet to conduct surveillance on citizens involved in anti-government protests, which he refused to do. Bar said the prime minister demanded the agency “provide details regarding the identities of Israeli citizens, protest activists” involved in any demonstrations against the Netanyahu government, and monitor those deemed to be “protest funders”.Who is Ronen Bar, the sacked chief of Israel’s Shin Bet security service?Read moreBar also alleged that Netanyahu had made clear to him that in a constitutional crisis, his loyalty must be to the prime minister and not the high court of justice. He also said “an effort was made to coerce me” to sign a document that would have helped Netanyahu avoid publicly testifying in court in a corruption case against him, which Bar pushed back on.Bar alleged that Netanyahu would voice these demands at the ends of meetings, away from any official documentation. “It was clearly intended to prevent any record of the conversation,” said Bar.“To this day, the reason for my firing is not clear to me,” he wrote in the affidavit. “But, the developments that took place over the last few months indicate one thing: at some point late last year, the decision to fire me was consolidated. It was not rooted in any professional metric, but out of an expectation by Netanyahu that I would be personally loyal to him.”In the buildup to Monday’s submission to the courts, it was reported Bar had been put under immense pressure by Netanyahu’s government not to submit his affidavit. He had initially been due to submit it on Sunday, but requested an extra day. It was also leaked to Israeli media that Bar intended to resign in mid-May, which was immediately denied by Shin Bet.Netanyahu’s office hit back instantly at Bar’s allegations, calling them “a complete lie” and saying the “false affidavit” would be refuted. The government has until Thursday to submit its response to the courts. Netanyahu has said he had lost all trust in Bar’s capacity to lead Shin Bet and accused him of a conflict of interest and politicising the agency.Yair Lapid, the leader of the political opposition, said that Bar’s affidavit “proves that Netanyahu is a danger to Israeli security and cannot continue to serve as prime minister.”The relationship between Bar and Netanyahu had become increasingly acrimonious after the 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas militants in southern Israel. In a report on the events, Shin Bet admitted the agency’s own failures but also criticised policies of the Netanyahu government that it said had enabled a buildup of Hamas in Gaza.Netanyahu has never accepted any responsibility for Israel’s worst national security disaster, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and led to 251 being abducted and held hostage in Gaza.Bar’s authorisation for Shin Bet to open two investigations into Netanyahu’s close aides, including one forallegedly taking payments from Qatar to promote its interests in Israel, at the same time that Qatar was partly financing Hamas in Gaza, was said to only strengthen the prime minister’s animosity. With Netanyahu already facing a multitude of corruption charges in court, political opponents have alleged he wanted to remove Bar in order to sabotage the investigations.Is Qatargate a scandal too far even for Benjamin Netanyahu?Read moreIn his affidavit, Bar stood by the actions taken by Shin Bet. “The incitement that has accompanied the investigations, against me and all those tasked with protecting state secrets, demonstrates the connection between the investigations and the timing of my dismissal,” he said.On Sunday night, Shlomo Karhi, a minister in Netanyahu’s Likud party, told Israeli media that the courts should not be interfering with the cabinet decision to dismiss Bar. “Those who talk about the high court of justice, how it’s the be-all and end-all, what is democratic about that?” he said.In a press conference, Lapid condemned the direct threats of violence that Bar was facing for standing up to the Netanyahu government. “The level of incitement and insanity are without precedent,” he said. “The red line has been crossed. If we don’t stop this, there will be a political assassination, possibly more than one. Jews will kill Jews.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warQatarnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, he was told his 36-year-old son Ashish, a Bhutanese refugee resettled in the US, was being deported.Ashish had been caught in a domestic dispute that led to police involvement. After several days in detention without proper legal support, he was caught up inDonald Trump’s migration crackdownand deported to Bhutan.But what followed was a surreal sequence of events that left Ashish and nine other Bhutanese refugees stateless: abandoned by the country they once fled, expelled by the one they tried to call home, and detained by the one they sought refuge in.Narayan was one of 100,000 Nepali-speaking Bhutanese whofled the country in the early 1990sto escape persecution. Many saw emigration as the only hope for a future. Narayan’s children were granted refugee status in the US, but Narayan himself was disqualified over paperwork errors and he still lives in the Beldangi refugee camp in eastern Nepal.Now, decades later, his son is back – but not welcomed by Bhutan, nor recognized inNepal.According to Nepal’s director general of immigration, Govinda Prasad Rijal, four of the 10 deported Bhutanese refugees, including Ashish, were taken into custody for entering Nepal illegally via India.“They were taken from the refugee camp on 28 March because they had entered Nepal without valid visas,” he said. “Since the matter is still under investigation, we have not decided whether they will be deported to India, returned to Bhutan, or what other action might be taken.”However, after the family filed a habeas corpus petition in Nepal’s supreme court, the court issued an order to produce them before the court on 24 April and not to deport them until then.Ashish and nine others were first flown from the US to Delhi, where they were reportedly treated well and even put up in a hotel during transit. The following day, they were flown to Paro international airport in Bhutan.There, according to Ashish’s father, the Bhutanese government welcomed them courteously but didn’t allow them to stay long. After routine questioning, the group was handed 30,000 Indian rupees each and transported to the Indian border town of Phuentsholing. Within 24 hours, they were out of Bhutan again.“The fact that Bhutan accepted them from the United States shows an acknowledgment of their citizenship. But deporting them to the Indian border within a day reveals a deceptive character,” said Dr Gopal Krishna Shiwakoti, former chair of the Asia Pacific Rights Network. “It’s strange in itself to send them to a country that had earlier refused to recognize them as its citizens, leading the US to resettle them in a third country.”From Phuentsholing, the group made its way to Nepal through Indian intermediaries. Later, Ashish and his friends Santosh Darji, Roshan Tamang and Ashok Gurung were detained by Nepalese authorities.“I was shocked,” Narayan says. “To be treated like a criminal in your own refugee camp, after all these years … it breaks you.”Nepal has no comprehensive legal framework addressing refugee protection or statelessness. That leaves people like Ashish in legal limbo – neither welcomed back by Bhutan nor recognized as refugees in Nepal.Tulsi Bhattarai, the immigration officer leading the investigation, confirmed that four of the 10 individuals were in custody. “Their statements confirm they entered Nepal from Bhutan via India,” he said. “We’ve collected documents from their time in the refugee camps and submitted a full report.”Activists argue the situation echoes the early days of the 1990s refugee crisis.“We’ve come full circle,” says Shiwakoti. “This is a 360-degree repeat of history. Nepal must urgently initiate diplomatic engagement with Bhutan to resolve this issue.”From 2007 to 2018, more than 113,000 Bhutanese refugees were resettled in third countries, mainly the US, according to the UNHCR. But about 6,500 still remain in camps in Nepal, caught in a state of indefinite limbo. Now, for deportees like Ashish, a new crisis is unfolding.International rights groups are raising alarm. In a joint statement, Bhutanese political and civil society leaders have appealed to the United Nations, the US and Indian embassies, and the government of Nepal for intervention. Their core demand is that the 10 deported individuals be recognized as Bhutanese nationals and protected under international refugee law.“These people are not just numbers. They have histories, identities and rights,” says Ram Karki, coordinator of the Global Campaign for the Release of Political Prisoners in Bhutan (GCRPPB).Back in Beldangi, Narayan waits. His son remains in custody, with uncertain future.“I just want my son to be free,” he adds. “We lost our country once. Must we lose it again?”Explore more on these topicsBhutanRights and freedomNepalSouth and central AsiaUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

We’re simply not going to find a way to do that. The cap is popular with key voters, who see it as a matter of fairness,” one source said.In a letter toKeir Starmeron Tuesday, groups including Barnardo’s, Save the Children UK and Citizens Advice said scrapping the two-child benefit limit would be the most cost-effective way to reduce child poverty.The ChildPovertyAction Group, which signed the letter, estimated the number of children in poverty would increase from 4.5 million to 4.8 million by 2029 unless urgent action is taken.Child poverty predicted to rise in most of UK except ScotlandRead moreThe government is planning to publish its long-awaited child poverty strategy in June, around the time of the spending review, raising expectations the plan will come with funding attached to try to drive down poverty levels.The government is also launching its policy of introducing free breakfast clubs into all primary schools in England as part of an initiative to reduce child poverty. The first 750 clubs, providing 30 minutes of morning childcare, open on Tuesday as part of a trial before a national rollout.Ministers said the extra time could save parents £450 a year, if their child went every day, with up to £7,500 more saved by the provision of 30 hours of free childcare per week from September, up from 15 hours a week.The breakfast clubs policy is being promoted not only as a way to improve school attendance, educational performance and attainment, but also as a primary lever for reducing poverty, with 67,000 of the 180,000 pupils set to benefit coming from the most dis­advantaged areas of England.But Labour MPs said while they strongly supported breakfast clubs, they remained concerned the two-child cap, along with wider cuts to disability benefits, would drive more families with children into poverty.“Ditching the cap is by far the most effective way of tackling child poverty. We have a moral obligation to do this,” one MP said. “I’m afraid they’ll use the breakfast clubs to soften us up to tell us the two-child benefit cap remains.”Ministers are still looking at ways to alleviate the impact of the two-child limit for universal credit or child tax credit, imposed by the Conservatives in 2017, without spending the £3.6bn required to remove it entirely.Among the options is applying the limit only to those with children who are five and over, exempting parents of disabled children or parents in work, and increasing child benefit payments for parents of young children. A separate proposal for a three-child limit has also been discussed.Charities have called for Labour ministers to ditch the benefits restriction as part of the child poverty plan, warning that a failure to do could mean child poverty levels soaring by the end of this parliament.In their letter to Starmer, they said: “Scrapping the two-child limit is by far the most cost-effective way to reduce child poverty. It would lift 350,000 children out of poverty overnight and result in 700,000 children living in less deep poverty.“If it is not scrapped, the stark reality is that child poverty will be significantly higher at the end of this parliament than when the government took office, making this the first time a Labour government would leave such a legacy.”However, aides said there was little political appetite within No 10 to lift the cap entirely, with polls suggesting that voters support it. Others have suggested the tight fiscal circumstances mean ministers will not change track, despite some feeling the limit is overly punitive.Explore more on these topicsPovertyCharitiesBenefitsChildrenKeir StarmerTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

Yet here we have a private sector enterprise, travel and tourism, contributing 10% of UK GDP, creating jobs, but we are not prioritising it in any way. We are sabotaging ourselves.”Retailers including the boss of luxury brand Burberry have said that the scrapping of a VAT tax break for tourists has put the UK at a“competitive disadvantage for global shoppers”.“The UK is losing value share compared to other European partners,” said Simpson, speaking to the Press Association.She also criticised the decision to cut tourism authority VisitBritain’s budget by 44% this year.On 1 April, VisitBritain’s “Great Britain and Northern Ireland” destination promotion programme budget was cut to £10.57m, from £18.85m last year. On the same day, air passenger duty for many visitors to the UK increased.A day later, the requirement for the £10 electronic travel authorisation (ETA) was imposed on all European visitors, apart from the Irish, and has since increased to £16.Millions of tourists in UK could be asked to pay local visitor levyRead more“You need to sell the UK,” said Simpson. “It’s really important that you create stories about the UK so that international visitors come to all our regions. You need to sell Harry Potter. You need to sell Jane Austen. You need to sell Richard III.”A government spokesperson said that VisitBritain’s campaign “remains an effective tool driving economic growth”.“The UK is one of the most visited countries in the world and international tourism drives billions into our economy,” said the spokesperson. “We are supporting the continued growth of this industry and will be launching a national visitor economy strategy this autumn to help meet our ambition to welcome 50 million international visitors a year to the UK by 2030.”The WTTC study, produced in collaboration with consultancy OxfordEconomics, also found that travel and tourism contributed £286bn to the UK’s economy in 2024, up 3.9% from 2019.Explore more on these topicsEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicsEconomic policyAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, is also expected to attend.French officials said the five countries held an “excellent” day of talks in Paris last week, with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, urging those present to put pressure on Moscow to end the fighting.Britain and France, backed by a “coalition of the willing”, have already proposed providing a “reassurance” force for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire, but the US has so far held off its support.After last Thursday’s meeting, Zelenskyy expressed frustration that the US envoy had “taken on the strategy of the Russian side”.Luxon and Starmer are expected to visit a military base on Wednesday to see British andNew Zealandpersonnel train Ukrainian troops as part of the UK’s Operation Interflex.More than 54,000 Ukrainians have already received training, and Luxon is expected to confirm on Tuesday that New Zealand will extend its support for the programme until the end of the year.In a further show of support for Ukraine, Starmer is expected to announce a deal worth £30m for drones produced by Syos Aerospace, a New Zealand company with a factory in Hampshire.Drones have become increasingly important over the course of the war in Ukraine, and now account for more battlefield casualties than artillery.The pair will also instruct their defence ministers to begin work on a new defence partnership between the UK and New Zealand, replacing the one signed in 2015.The UK and New Zealand have longstanding defence links. Both nations belong to the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network, and the New Zealand navy is providing a frigate, HMNZS Te Kaha, for the UK carrier strike group scheduled to set sail for the Indian Ocean from Portsmouth on Tuesday.Starmer will say: “From the beaches of Gallipoli to the vital work we have been doing together on Operation Interflex and our support for Ukraine, the UK and New Zealand have stood shoulder to shoulder for generations in pursuit of peace and stability.“As the world becomes an increasingly dangerous place, I am proud how much we are doing together to support our national and economic security – stepping up our defence spending, deploying our navies together in the Indo-Pacific, and continuing our work to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position to deter an increasingly aggressive Russia.”Explore more on these topicsDefence policyNew ZealandChristopher LuxonKeir StarmerUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

[For] April to date, rainfall figures are well below where they should be.”The average rainfall figure for April nationally is 71mm but the UK has only had 27.2mm so far, or 38% of the April average.Tuesday is expected to get off to a chilly start with a lot of dry and fine weather between a few isolated showers.Stroud added: “It will cloud over from the west late in the day, with a band of heavy rain and strong and gusty winds arriving across England and Wales, pushing into Northern Ireland, southern Scotland during the overnight period into Wednesday morning.“That air of rain is not hanging around, it’s actually moving quite quickly south and eastwards across the country.“So conditions will improve significantly during the course of the afternoon.“Sunny spells and showers is the name of the game on Wednesday afternoon, and that leads quite nicely into a generally dry and settled spell of weather on Thursday.“But that too will be very short lived, with another band of cloud and rain slowly edging in from the west towards the end of the week, and more especially next weekend.”The driest and brightest skies will be in the eastern parts of the country, while it will be wet and cloudy in parts of Wales, central southern England and Northern Ireland.View image in fullscreenA helicopter douses a wildfire with water on the Isle of Bute on 10 April.Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty ImagesThe UK has had one of the worst wildfire seasons on record following one of the driest Marches in decades combined with warmer than average temperatures in April.Abergwesyn Common in Powys, Wales wasconsumed by a 1,600 hectare (3,950 acre) fire, an area roughly 400 times the size of Cardiff’s Principality Stadium.Last week, Wales’s three fire services said they had responded to more than 1,300 grass fires this year.On the Mourne Mountains in Northern Ireland, recent fires scorched land used by wildlife including small heath butterflies, rove beetles, skylarks and peregrine falcons.At Howden Moor in the Peak District, the National Trust said a recent fire that stretched for about three miles had caused £30,000 worth of damage.Explore more on these topicsUK weathernewsShareReuse this content"

He later died in hospital.Raji’s sisters, Zainab Raji and Ruki Ware, said the anniversary of their brother’s death was “a painful reminder of 10 years of loss”. “Our family is not going to get that time back,” they said in an appeal.The independent charity Crimestoppers is offering a reward of up to £20,000 for information that leads to the identification and prosecution of those responsible for the murder.Ola Raji.Photograph: Family handout/PATheMetropolitan policesaid it was interested in speaking to witnesses, including a woman driving a black Vauxhall Corsa in the area between 21.45 and 23.00, and two men “who returned to an address in Pear Court at 23.10”.In an appeal for information, Raji’s sisters said: “When we get together, there is always that sense of something missing. There are children who never get to know their uncle, who would still be so young even now. The laughter we share is that little less loud. There is a smile absent in the photographs.“But this is not just about our family. It’s about safety on the streets of Peckham and the wider south London area. There is no doubt the people who did this once could carry out similar attacks again. Maybe they already have.“We are getting closer to the truth – for example, we now know about phone calls Ola received shortly before the attack. Just the smallest piece of evidence from any witnesses or those with knowledge of what happened could be enough to put those responsible behind bars and make the streets safer for the entire community.”The pair told MailOnline last week that they had found two new witnesses after being forced to investigate the crime themselves due to police failings.DCI Alex Gammampila, who is leading the investigation, said: “Ola was an innocent man, in the wrong place at the worst time. His murder has devastated his friends and family, and those in the local community.“Ten years on, we continue to appeal for anyone who has any information to come forward.“Were you out in Peckham that night? Were you also watching the football that night, or were you near Commercial Way? Did you see or hear the shooting or anything that struck you as being unusual?“No piece of information is too small, and could be the final piece of the puzzle that leads us to identify Ola’s attackers.”Alexa Loukas, London regional manager at Crimestoppers, said Raji’s death was “deeply unsettling for his loved ones and the local community”.Detectives are continuing to investigate the possibility that Raji’s attackers left the scene on foot, the Met said.Three individuals were arrested on suspicion of murder, and a further two individuals were arrested for perverting the course of justice but no further action was taken against them and no criminal charges were ever brought.Anyone with information should call 101, giving the reference 2597/16APR25, or upload information, including photos or videos, to thededicated appeal page.Explore more on these topicsCrimeLondonMetropolitan policePolicenewsShareReuse this content"

Noem said the incident remained unresolved.The Metropolitan police department in Washington on Monday referred questions to the homeland security department. The Secret Service also referred a request for comment to the department.The DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a statementemailedto the New York Times, the department said: “Her entire family was in town including her children and grandchildren. She was using the cash withdrawal to treat her family to dinner, activities and Easter gifts.”US stock markets fall again as Trump calls Fed chair ‘a major loser’Read moreNoem, who oversees a department that is charged with securing the nation’s borders and its homeland, is protected by Secret Service agents.NBC News,citing a source who witnessed the meal, reported that “at least two on-duty plainclothes members of the US Secret Service” were seated at the restaurant’s bar.The Secret Service is among the agencies housed within the department, along with Fema and the Coast Guard.It is unclear whether Noem, a high-profile cabinet official who is tasked with carrying out Trump’s mass deportation campaign, was targeted or if the incident was random.According to CNN,which first reported the incident, a Secret Service review of security camera footage from the restaurant showed an “unknown white male wearing a medical mask steal her bag and leave the restaurant”.Asked about the theft, Noem told reporters on Monday: “I don’t think I can comment on it yet. It’s not resolved yet.”Noem has aggressively pushed Trump’s hardline approach to immigration enforcement, recentlytravelingto El Salvador, where she wascriticizedfor touring a notoriousmaximum-security prisonthat is holding hundreds ofVenezuelansdeported from the US earlier this month. That includes a Maryland man the administration deported in error and is declining to bring back, despite the supreme court unanimously ruling that the government should “facilitate” his return.While there, Noemfilmed a videoof herself in front of a cell packed with prisoners, warning undocumented immigrants living in the US that “you could end up in this El Salvadorian prison”. On social media, critics assailed the secretary’s message – but also forthe flashy accessorywrapping her wrist: a gold Rolex watch that sells forabout $50,000.Prior to joining theTrump administration, Noem was the governor of South Dakota and previously represented the state in the US House of Representatives.Explore more on these topicsKristi NoemTrump administrationUS politicsWashington DCnewsShareReuse this content"

Former tech stocks favorites including Tesla and Nvidia lost ground, while the value of the dollar fell to multiyear lows against most major currencies.Stock markets had recovered the losses they endured after Trump rolled out his“liberation day” tariffsproposals, which would have imposed huge levies on all of the US’s trading partners. But almost all the gains made in the stock market following Trump’s announcement of a90-day pauseof his so-called reciprocal tariffs have been erased amid these new jabs against Powell.Powell, known to be extremely measured in his public remarks, has in recent weeks spoken out about Trump’s tariffs and warned that they may lead to a “challenging scenario” for the Fed, implying that the Fed has no plans to cut interest rates anytime soon.“Tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation. The inflation effects could also be more persistent,” Powelltold reporters on 16 April.US inflation peaked at 9% in June 2022 but has slowly come down over the last few years, largely due to the Fed’s careful adjustment of interest rates. The Fed has set its inflation rate target at 2%.Powell often refers to the central bank’s “dual mandate” – to keep inflation in check while maximising employment. Higher interest rates can bring down prices, though it can come at the risk of higher unemployment. Over the last few years, the Fed has been able to bring down inflation while keeping the unemployment rate relatively low, around 4%. Last month, inflationcooledto 2.4%, though the most recent government figures do not account for the Trump tariffs.The Fed has long been treated as a nonpartisan, nonpolitical federal agency, though Trump has recently floated the idea of terminating Powell, whose term is up in May 2026. “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Trump wrote on social media last week.Such a move would be unprecedented and would likely put Wall Street into a further tailspin. In an interview with CNBC, Krishna Guha, the vice-chair of Evercore ISI, an equity research firm, said that there would be a “severe reaction” from markets if Trump fires Powell.“I can’t believe that’s what the administration is trying to achieve,” Guha said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 16-member panel of medical experts, appointed by the health secretary without Senate confirmation, has designated dozens of life-saving screenings and treatments as essential preventive care.If the justices uphold the lower court’s ruling, health associations said in a filing, life-saving tests and treatments that have been cost-free would become subject to co-pays and deductibles, deterring many Americans from obtaining them.Amy Klobuchar calls on supreme court to hold Trump officials in contemptRead moreThe case represents the latest in a long series of legal challenges to Barack Obama’s signature healthcare legislation to reach the nation’s highest court since its passage in 2010. A big critic of the program during his first term, Trump and his administration have now taken over the case after the Biden administration initially filed the appeal.In oral arguments, the justices posed sharp questions over whether the law gives the HHS secretary the appropriate level of supervision over the taskforce, including the power to influence its recommendations and fire members at will, or if the group operates as a largely independent governmental body whose recommendations effectively have the force of law.Jonathan Mitchell, the conservative lawyer representing the plaintiffs who previously represented Trump in ballot access litigation, insisted that taskforce members are “principal officers” because “their preventive care coverage mandates are neither directed nor supervised by the Secretary of Health and Human Services”.Mitchell’s argument hinges on interpreting statutory language requiring the task force to be “independent” and “protected from political pressure”, which he argues is incompatible with secretary oversight: “We don’t see any way that statutory language can be squared with the regime envisioned by the government,” he told the justices.Several justices appeared skeptical of Mitchell’s reading of the statute, with Justice Elena Kagan questioning whether Congress would create a board without specifying who appoints its members: “I mean, it would be an odd statute. I doubt you could find another where Congress has set up a board and … just not said who should appoint.”The taskforce is made up of medical experts who serve four-year terms on a volunteer basis. It reviews medical evidence and public feedback and issues recommendations about which preventive services would be most effective for detecting illnesses earlier or addressing ailments before a patient’s condition worsens.The taskforce has identified dozens of preventive services as having a high or moderate net benefit to patients including screenings to detect diabetes and various types of cancer, statin medications to lower the risk of heart disease and stroke, and interventions to help patients quit smoking or unhealthy alcohol use.The New Orleans-based fifth US circuit court of appeals ruled in 2024 that the taskforce’s structure violates the constitution, as the plaintiffs claimed. The government’s appeal of the fifth circuit’s decision initially was filed by Biden’s administration before being taken up by Trump.Trump’s administration argued in a supreme court brief that the taskforce’s preventive care recommendations cannot become legally binding on insurers without the HHS secretary’s permission.“The secretary can remove them at will, and the threat of removal is the ultimate tool for control over final decisions on recommendations,” justice department lawyers wrote.For this and other reasons, justice department lawyers argued, the taskforce’s members should be seen as so-called “inferior officers”, meaning they can be lawfully appointed by an executive branch department head – like the HHS secretary – and do not require Senate confirmation under the constitution.In a supreme court filing, the plaintiffs argued that the Affordable Care Act has transformed the longstanding taskforce from an advisory body into one that now issues “decrees” to insurers, adding that the HHS secretary has no authority to stop taskforce recommendations from becoming binding law.US supreme court orders temporary halt to deportations of Venezuelan menRead moreThe taskforce’s lack of supervision, they argued, makes its members “principal officers” who must be presidentially appointed and Senate confirmed under the constitution.Before the case was narrowed to the appointments issue, the lawsuit included a religious objection to being required to cover pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV. They claimed that such drugs “facilitate and encourage homosexual behavior, prostitution, sexual promiscuity and intravenous drug use”.The fifth circuit’s ruling also rejected the government’s request to remove certain offending words from the Obamacare provision at issue – a process called severing – in order to make that part of the law conform to the constitution. That issue was also part of the appeal before the supreme court.The supreme court’s decision was expected by the end of June.Explore more on these topicsUS supreme courtUS healthcareTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The chaos and uncertainty have been too strong even for Musk, the great disrupter, but Navarro’s silky mien still assures the US all is well.Even after the tech tycoon publicly compared him to a sack of bricks, and added that he was “truly a moron”, Navarro retained his composure. “I’ve been called worse,” hetold NBC.That is true. Navarro has been called a charlatan and a criminal who risks driving the world economy off a cliff.It is a remarkable metamorphosis for a man who a decade ago was a little-known academic nearing retirement at the University of California, Irvine, a respected, stolid institution in Orange County.Then the professor’s hawkish views on China caught the eye of Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and vaulted him to Washington, where he played key roles in economic policy, the Covid pandemic and the attempt to overturn the 2020 election, a vortex that landed him in jail – for contempt of Congress – only for him to re-emerge, more influential than ever, in Trump’s second administration.“This is the land of reinvention, both cosmetic and ideological, and he is part of that,” said John Pitney, a political scientist and author at Claremont McKenna College.Critics worry that Navarro is trying to reinvent economic rules and the postwar global order with improvisation and bluster that could trigger recession and backlash. For Trump, Navarro is the expert who can articulate a daring and necessary pivot to protectionism.Navarro’s early life, and career, suggested a different trajectory. The son of a musician and a secretary, he grew up on the east coast and obtained a master’s degree in public administration and then a PhD in economics from Harvard. Hisdoctoral dissertationwas not on trade but on corporations’ charity motives.He taught economics at San Diego universities and did research on public utilities before landing a tenure position as professor of economics and public policy at UCI in 1989. Tanned and svelte, he had the look of a glossy politician and ran as a Democrat for elected office, including for mayor of San Diego and Congress, but lost.In 2001 he switched to writing get-rich investing books such as If It’s Raining in Brazil, Buy Starbucks: The Investor’s Guide to Profiting from News and Other Market-Moving Events.In 2006 the professor took another swerve by publishing the first of a series of books, and accompanying documentaries, that assailed China as an insatiable menace that bullies, lies and cheats, especially on trade rules through currency manipulation, illegal export subsidies, intellectual property theft and polluting sweatshops.There is no evidence of causality but Navarro’s alarm coincided with California’s proliferating number of Chinese investors and students, notably at UCI, which prompted racially tinged nicknames such as the University of Chinese Immigrants and the University of Caucasian Isolation.Other economists also accused Beijing of unfair practices but Navarro’s radical critique put him on the fringe.In 2016 Trump reportedly instructed his son-in-law Jared Kushner to do research to bolster his views on China. Kushner found Navarro’s book, Death By China, on Amazon, and Navarro ended up advising the campaign.In aninterview that year with the Guardiannear his Laguna Beach home, Navarro endorsed Trump’s use of the word rape to characterise Beijing’s impact on the US. “It’s an apt description of the damage and carnage that China’s trade policies have wrought on the American economic heartland. What’s happening is rapacious.” He also endorsed Trump’s proposed 45% tariffs on Chinese goods, which he said would compel Beijing to back down. “We’re already in a trade war with China. The problem is we’ve not been fighting back. Trump, through tariffs, wants to call a truce.”Trump had few credentialed academics on his team so Navarro served a useful purpose, Pitney said. “He provided a degree of scholarly cover for what Trump was saying. That’s why he was brought into the administration.”Navarro’s standing in the White House survived the disclosure that his bookscited a fictitious expert, Ron Vara, that is an anagram of Navarro. He sought to shrug off the deception by calling it an “inside joke” with himself and a “Hitchcockian writing device”.In Trump’s first administration, more mainstream economic advisers prevailed and there was no trade war. Even so, Navarro expanded his remit to public health during the pandemic, which afforded more opportunity to assail China, and established personal chemistry with the president that made him a survivor amid White House personnel flux.After his chief lost the 2020 election, Navarro promoted the theory that the election was rigged and sought to delay its certification. For rebuffing a congressional committee that investigated theJanuary 2021 attack on the Capitolhe was found guilty of criminal contempt and last year served four months in prison.Now back in the White House as Trump’s senior counsellor for trade and manufacturing, Navarro’s influence has been felt intariffs, stock market volatility andgrim economic warningsdespite a pause in the most severe tariffs for 90 days.Navarro has a combative streak yet he chose to project indifference over Musk’s insults. “It’s no problem,” he told CNN.

It was painted with Xiamen livery.The jet, which made refuelling stops in Guam and Hawaii on its 5,000-mile (8,000-km) return journey, was one of several 737 MAX jets – Boeing’s bestselling model – that had been waiting at Boeing’s Zhoushan completion centre for final work and delivery.China reportedly orders its airlines to halt Boeing jet deliveries amid US trade warRead moreTrump this month raised baseline tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%. In retaliation, China imposed a 125% tariff on US goods.A Chinese airline taking delivery of a Boeing jet could be crippled by the tariffs, given that a new 737 MAX has a market value of around $55m, according to IBA, an aviation consultancy. Beijing is reportedly considering ways to support airlines that lease Boeing jets and are facing higher costs.Last week it was reported that China’s government hadasked Chinese airlines to pause purchasesof aircraft-related equipment and parts from American companies like Boeing. China holds about 20% of the expected global demand for aircraft over the next two decades.Boeing’s order book had 130 planes scheduled for deliver to Chinese companies at the end of March for both commercial airlines and leasing firms, Airways Magreported.It was not clear which party made the decision for the aircraft to return to the US. Boeing and Xiamen had not responded to Reuters requests for comment at time of publication.Just hours before Trump detailed his so-called “liberation day” tariffs, Boeing chief executive,Kelly Ortberg, told a US Senate hearing that the company sold about 80% of its planes overseas and wanted to avoid getting into a situation where “certain markets become closed to us”.Ortberg said there was about half a trillion dollars in backlogged orders at the time.Confusion over changing tariffs couldleave many aircraft deliveries in limbo, with some airline CEOs saying they would defer delivery of planes rather than pay duties, analysts say.Michael O’Leary, the group chief executive of budget airline Ryanair, told the Financial Times last week that the company was due to receive 25 Boeing aircraft from August but “we might delay them and hope that common sense will prevail”.With Reuters in SeattleExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsBoeingAirline industryAerospace industryTariffsChinaShareReuse this content"

The president has historically respected the independence of thecentral bank, and kept out of its way – even if there was disagreement over Fed policy.But, of course, it looks like Trump is following his own playbook.“Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Trumpsaidon social media last week.Trump says Fed chair would resign if asked and condemns him over interest ratesRead moreThe Fed chair first took office in 2018 after an appointment from Trump, and was later reappointed by Joe Biden in 2022. Though his term is expected to end in May 2026, multiplereportssuggest that Trump is considering firing the chair before his term is up.Here’s what we know is going on between Trump and theFederal Reserve.What does the Federal Reserve do?As the central bank, the Fed manages the money supply in the US, primarily by setting the interest rate. When setting it, the Fed considers the inflation rate and the labor market, what it calls its “dual mandate”: higher interest rates could bring down inflation, but negatively affect the labor market, while lower interest rates could do the opposite.Over the last few years, starting before Trump’s his second term, the central bank has been trying to bring down inflation, which peaked at 9% in June 2022.To do that, the Fed raised interest rates to a multi-decade high of between 5.25% and 5.5%. Just a few years before, at the height of the pandemic, in 2020 and 2021, interest rates had been at close to zero. This made it cheaper to borrow money, including taking out mortgages.Late last year, the Fedlowered interest rates, which are now 4.25% to 4.5% – a whole point lower than where they were a year ago.US stock markets are very sensitive to Fed decisions. Stocks started to climb after September, when the Fed started cutting rates.Why is Trump attacking the Federal Reserve?Since Trump took office again, Fed officials held two meetings, in January and March, at which they could have changed interest rates. At both, they declined to touch the rates, citing economic uncertainty.After Trump introduced his newest slate of tariffs, he said on social media that he expects Powell to cut interest rates. “This would be a PERFECT time” for rate cuts, Trumpwroteon social media. “CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS.”From Trump’s perspective, cutting rates could offset the impact that his tariffs are having on the US stock market. But for Fed officials, it would risk exacerbating inflation.Powell – who is extremely careful with his public remarks – made some statements that made clear the Fed believes Trump’s tariffs will make prices go up, making it far less likely that the central bank would decrease rates.“Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well-anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,” he said in Chicago last week.This seemed to set Trump off. “If I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast, believe me,” the presidenttold reportersin the Oval Office on Thursday. “I’m not happy with him.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s unclear how the court will rule, but itallowedthe firings to stand, overruling a lower court.Fed chair says Trump tariffs could make inflation worse as US stocks slide furtherRead more“I don’t think that that decision will apply to the Fed, but I don’t know,” Powell said. “It’s a situation that we’re monitoring carefully.”The Fed’s next board meeting is on 6 and 7 May. Trump is likely trying to pressure the Fed ahead of it, but it is unlikely that officials will budge.What is the Fed’s case for independence from the White House?The Fed, which holds huge power over the economy, has to be extremely careful about each decision it makes.Moves made by the central bank can affect the stock market, the value of the US dollar and government bonds – which all, in turn, affect theUS economy.On the Fed’s independence, Powell said that officials “will only make our decisions based on our best thinking, based on our best analysis of the data and what is the way to achieve our dual mandate goals as we can to best serve the American people”.“We will do what we do strictly without consideration of political or any other extraneous factors,” he said.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveJerome PowellDonald TrumpUS interest ratesInflationUnemploymentEconomic policyexplainersShareReuse this content"

But the recent tariff rate hikes mark an even greater blow for the restaurant.Sichuan peppercorns, which create the signature numbing spice of the regional Chinese cuisine, along with other ingredients, face an at least145% tariffafter last week’s tit-for-tat trade battle betweenChinaand the United States. The steep rate is an existential threat for restaurants across the country that rely on specialty ingredients imported from China to craft the authentic flavors of their dishes, said operators who were blindsided.“We’re really worried,” said Jen Lin-Liu, the director of events for Chang Chang. The restaurant is part of the Peter Chang restaurant group that operates a dozen Sichuan restaurants across Washington, Virginia and Maryland.Could Trump’s tariffs give a green light for corporate profiteering?Read moreThe restaurant group sources meats and vegetables from local farmers, including an Amish community in the Finger Lakes region that supplies its shiitake mushrooms and organic pork. Still, it is dependent on imported items such as fermented chili peppers and soy sauce, which give the dishes their unique taste.“Some of the products that we need just do not exist in the United States,” Lin-Liu said.The cost of other items is rising as well. “There are increases in any supply you can think of, from takeout boxes to printer paper to menu printing paper,” she said, adding that if thetariffrates stick, the price of a $20 dish may rise to $35 or $40.View image in fullscreenDumplings at Chang Chang.Photograph: Courtesy of Chang ChangGeorge Chen, the chef who created Eight Tables, a fine-dining restaurant inSan Francisco, said that while some of the items on his menu may be replaceable with options from Taiwan, it undermines the integrity he’s put into sourcing the unique ingredients for his dishes.“Replacements disrupt complex long-term relationships,” explained Chen. “It took me years to find the special spice vendors or the organic tea farmer inChinafrom my many years living and working there.”Eight Tables is part of a larger marketplace called China Live, which includes a dining hall, a cold-drinks bar and a shop that sells wares including chopsticks, glass tea mugs and pots.“The area most concerning is our retail platform,” said Chen. For those items, “it’s not possible to re-order at the tariff rates”.For direct importers, like the Mala Market, an online shop, the tariffs on Chinese products threaten its entire business model. Sichuan peppercorns are popular on the site, but it also sells a number of items produced in their original region using traditional methods. The owner, Taylor Holliday, calls these “heritage products”, which include soy sauce handcrafted in Zhongba, fermented soybeans aged for three years in Sichuan and sesame paste stone-ground in Shandong.US small business owner says China tariffs endanger her company: ‘I could lose my home’Read more“These are products which have been made in that exact area for hundreds if not thousands of years,” said Holliday. “They have such a history, there’s no way these products can be made anywhere else.”While part of Holliday’s business supplies wholesale items to restaurants around the country, the majority of its orders are from home cooks.“A lot of our customers are people who have a cultural or emotional attachment to China,” Holliday said. “It’s more than just the food, it’s a cultural attachment to these products.”EMei, a Sichuan restaurant inPhiladelphia, sources not only its peppercorns from China but also items such as chopsticks and plastic cutlery for takeout orders. Similar to many Chinese restaurants, delivery is a major part of the restaurant’s business.“So far, this is the main impact for us,” said Dan Tsao, the owner of EMei, who said the tariff hikes add about $1 to $1.50 to each delivery order.The tariffs may also create a supply issue for these items.“Importers are pausing more of their orders from China. They think 125% is crazy,” Tsao said.While the restaurant sources many of its ingredients from local farmers, it still relies on some imports from other countries. It orders broccoli from Mexico, shrimp from Ecuador and rice from Thailand. Rice is especially critical; the restaurant runs through a supply of about 200 pounds each night, Tsao said. SinceDonald Trump’s “liberation day” announcement earlier this month, the price per pound has already risen more than 25%.View image in fullscreenA broccoli field in Cadereyta, Nuevo León state, Mexico, on 24 March 2020.Photograph: Julio César Aguilar/AFP/Getty ImagesThe frenetic nature of the tariff policy shifts has left owners and suppliers cautious about which steps to take and how to plan for the future.Temu and Shein warn of US price hikes from next week due to Trump tariffsRead moreTsao has plans to open two more restaurants later this year and has noticed some construction estimates for renovations rising. Most of the building materials come from China, too.“I’m hesitating now,” he said. The possibility of a recession while the prices of supplies and renovations keep going up may change his calculation. “There will be all these ripple effects on the system and there’s so much economic uncertainty,” he added.Holliday said she has one container of product already on the way from China that is scheduled to clear US customs in about five weeks, but will not raise prices until she is forced to.“I’m praying that something happens by then,” she said. But if it doesn’t, she’s resigned to paying the tariffs.“There’s no other way we can run our business,” she said.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsRestaurantsChinaTariffsUS politicsFoodDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A two-year consensual relationship ensued, during which she alleges he raped her.“A woman can say ‘yes’ to consensual sexual relations with a man ninety-nine times, but when she says ‘no’ even once, that ‘no’ means no,” the lawsuit states. “Defendant Shannon Sharpe, a man who is accustomed to getting what he wants, completely fails to understand this basic concept. After many months of manipulating and controlling Plaintiff – a woman more than thirty years younger than he – and repeatedly threatening to brutally choke and violently slap her, Sharpe refused to accept the answer no and raped Plaintiff, despite her sobbing and repeated screams of ‘no.’”The woman also claims Sharpe threatened to kill her after she arrived at his house late on one occasion. Additionally she alleges he filmed some of their sexual encounters and shared the footage with others. She is seeking $50m in damages.In a statement from Sharpe’s lawyer posted to Sharpe’s X account, the former player denied the allegations. “Mr Sharpe categorically denies all allegations of coercion or misconduct – especially the gross lie of ‘rape’ – and will not submit to what he sees as an egregious attempt at blackmail,” the statement read in part.The woman is being represented by Tony Buzbee, who has also represented women who say they have been assaulted by Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs and NFL quarterback Deshaun Watson.Sharpe played 14 seasons in the NFL, won three Super Bowls and was an eight-time Pro Bowler. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2011. After retirement, he fashioned a successful media career with Fox Sports and ESPN, as well as hosting several podcasts.Explore more on these topicsNFLESPNUS television industryUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Fair enough. It’s an unusual race if there isn’t at least one team indignant at a decision that has not gone their way.However, the Dutchman soon appeared in a more vituperative frame of mind. Firstly, he declined to answer a question on the penalty incident when interviewed after climbing from his car. Then in the official FIA press conference he made the reason for his reticence explicit.“The problem is that I cannot share my opinion about it because I might get penalised also, so it’s better not to speak about it,” he said.When asked to explain he was clear. “I know I cannot swear in here but at the same time, you also can’t be critical in any form that might ‘harm’ or ‘danger’. Let me get the sheet out, there’s a lot of lines, you know? So that’s why it’s better not to talk about it. You can put yourself in trouble, and I don’t think anyone wants that.”What might have seemed an obtuse reference was patently clear to everyone within F1. Verstappen was almost certainly referring to the changes to FIA regulations for 2025 that introduced a series of draconian penalties for swearing or criticising the governing body.The swearing part is self-explanatory – pull a Sex Pistols on the Bill Grundy show and you’re busted – but it is worth quoting the other addition to the sporting code that forbids: “Any words, deeds or writings that have caused moral injury or loss to the FIA, its bodies, its members or its executive officers, and more generally on the interest of motor sport and on the values defended by the FIA.”This was what Verstappen was referring to on “the sheet” when he said “harm” or “danger”. The penalties for either offence – and it should be noted the second could make any critical comment potentially in breach – are a series of fines starting at €40,000 and rising to €120,000 for a third offence that would be accompanied by one month suspension from the championship. The latter would be catastrophic for any driver in a title fight.It is understood the changes were instigated by the FIA president, Mohammed Ben Sulayem, and considered by many as an attempt to suppress criticism.Verstappen has been generally much more short and guarded in press conferences this season, which he attributed in Jeddah to being misinterpreted on social media. “I prefer not to talk a lot because sometimes your words can be twisted or people interpret it in a different way. It’s honestly better not to say too much,” he said.Such a position is not unusual these days but equally what could not be misinterpreted was that with the few words he was willing to use, his ire was specifically aimed at the FIA regulations. He is far from alone in that stance.Verstappen was already at odds with the FIA after being penalised for swearing in a press conference at the Singapore GP last year. Before that weekend Ben Sulayem had made his position clear, stating he did not want drivers to swear, comparing it unfavourably to rap artists. Lewis Hamilton dismissed this comment as being influenced by a racial bias and stereotyping, while Lando Norris and Verstappen were among other drivers who also felt there was no need to pursue such a trivial matter.Verstappen chose to poke the bear only a day later and after his penalty warned that such pettiness could prompt him to leave the sport.Oscar Piastri storms to Saudi Arabian F1 GP win and now leads title raceRead moreThere was widespread support and sympathy for him from the drivers and shortly afterwards the body representing them, the Grand Prix Drivers’ Association, issued a public statement to the FIA demanding they stop treating drivers like children They also addressed the swearing controversy and took issue with the “tone and ­language” used by Ben Sulayem in relation to his ­objections and ­questioned the financial ­transparency of the FIA, in how the organisation used the money from fines.When the FIA did not respond George Russell, a GPDA director, stated drivers were “fed up” with the situation and warned it was going in the “wrong direction”.Verstappen is a canny operator and knows where a few well-chosen words, or indeed declining to comment, will be most effective; he would also have been aware of the timing, with Ben Sulayem’s tenure under the spotlight.View image in fullscreenGeorge Russell said F1 drivers are ‘fed up’ with the situation concerning the new FIA regulations.Photograph: Jakub Porzycki/ReutersLess than two weeks ago the FIA’s deputy president for sport, Robert Reid, announced his resignation, citing what he called “a fundamental breakdown in governance standards” and “critical decisions being made without due process”. He is the latest member of senior personnel to have depart since Ben Sulayem took over.Reid’s resignation came just after the chair of Motorsport UK, David Richards, published an open letter expressing a growing number of people had legitimate concerns that: “The governance and constitutional organisation of the FIA is becoming ever more opaque and concentrating power in the hands of the president alone”.Verstappen will now doubtless switch his focus to the next round in Miami in two weeks but he has made his point and it is one expected to be aired vigorously again in Florida.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMax VerstappenRed BullMotor sportcommentShareReuse this content"

All that matters now is that this meticulous, softly ­spoken manager is the perfect fit for ­Nottingham Forest.They have provided Nuno with the perfect platform for his counterpunching tactics and, in what would surely be the story of the ­Premier League season, are closing in on Champions League football after beating Ange Postecoglou’s half-hearted Spurs.Nuno and Nottingham Forest grateful recipients of Dr Tottenham’s elixir | Ed AaronsRead moreThis was clinical and resilient from Forest as they bounced back from two successive defeats by rising into third place with five games left. Nerves, it seems, are not for them. They struck early through Elliot ­Anderson and Chris Wood, who punished ­diffident defending with his 19th goal of a ­wonderful league campaign, and then leant on their defensive prowess to claim the points at theTottenham HotspurStadium. Spurs, stuck in 16th after falling to their 18th defeat in 33 games, were beaten inside 16 minutes, a header from Richarlison coming too late to save them.“The final minutes were full of anxiety,” Nuno said. “Tottenham put us against the ropes. We are very proud of the way we competed today. We reacted well after the recent ­performances. The way we compete is as a team.”Although Forest had to tweak their back four because of Ola Aina’s absence through injury, with Harry Toffolo coming in for his first league start of the season at left-back, there was little sign of expectation weighing them down.The home fans must have ­wondered if the team in red could possibly have been coached by the same man who was deemed too negative before beingsacked after four unhappy monthsin charge here in 2021. Nuno had Forest playing on the front foot, even if the omission of Callum Hudson-Odoi had suggested a more measured approach before kick-off, and it was not long before they exposed frailties within ­Postecoglou’s setup.View image in fullscreenNottingham Forest’s Matz Sels makes a save from Tottenham’s Richarlison.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersSpurs were not in the zone despite Postecoglou making five changes to the side thatsaw off Eintracht F­rankfurt. They seemed startled by Forest’s intensity and did not even wake up after seeing Morgan Gibbs-White test Guglielmo Vicario with a stinging drive in the fourth minute.Forest went ahead from the resulting corner. Anthony Elanga’s delivery was disappointing but Pedro Porro’s clearance was worse, exposing a lack of organisation. There was no ­pressure on Anderson when the ball fell to him on the edge of the area, allowing the midfielder to drive through a shot that flicked off Rodrigo Bentancur and beat Vicario for power.The venom of Anderson’s strike shook Spurs, who looked flimsy next to such conviction. This is why ­Postecoglou’s position is so vulnerable, even with a Europa League ­semi-final against Bodø/Glimt to come. He chose not to rest Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven in central defence, but Spurs remained feeble in the face of Forest’s directness.The crosses kept coming. Spurs could not handle Wood. The striker had one effort disallowed for offside but soon made it 2-0, rising unchallenged to head past a flapping Vicario. Porro, standing off, had done nothing to stop Elanga’s inswinging cross.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wilson Odobert, Mathys Tel and Richarlison had chances. The thought occurred that Spurs would have been better served by trying harder when it was 0-0.Postecoglou was pushing it when he claimed that his side played “outstanding” football. “It’s another game we’ve lost we shouldn’t lose,” he said. “We make things really difficult for ourselves in key moments. We gave away poor goals. It’s too many losses. I know that.”Forest adjusted during the break, gearing themselves up for a rearguard action by replacing Elanga with ­Morato, who joined Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic in the middle of a back five. This was Nuno showing his flexibility, adjusting to circumstance in a way that Postecoglou rarely does. The danger, though, was inviting pressure. It was not done yet.Forest went close to a third, Gibbs-White missing a good chance, but Spurs stirred. Toffolo, whose diligence after coming in from the cold summed up Forest’s unity, cleared Dejan Kulusevski’s header off the line. Matz Sels twice thwarted Richarlison.Spurs enhanced their attack, Dominic Solanke and Brennan Johnson coming on, and they broke through when Richarlison glanced Porro’s cross past Sels after 87 minutes.Forest had to survive seven added minutes, Nuno praying for the final whistle. The celebrations at the end were gleeful. Forest head to ­Wembley on Sunday, an FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City there to be won, and will keep dreaming. Out of the top five before the start of play, the question was whether they could handle the pressure. Their response was resounding.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTottenham HotspurNottingham Forestmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The twistiescause gymnasts to lose their orientation while in the air, a dangerous situation in a sport where falls can cause serious injury. The condition,along with mental health concerns, caused Biles to withdraw from all but one final at the Tokyo Olympics, where her only medal was a bronze on the beam.However, Boorman says Biles suffered from the twisties years earlier, before her Olympic debut in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, when her four gold medals propelled her to worldwide fame.Simone Biles’ twisties: mental block which puts gymnasts at serious riskRead more“Before Simone introduced the world to the twisties in 2021, she had experienced this proprioception phenomenon in January of 2016,” Boorman writes in her new book. “When this happens to a gymnast who is flipping 10-plus feet in the air and they lose body awareness in space and time – not knowing if they’re going to land on their back, feet or head – it’s much more dangerous [than the “yips” in baseball or golf].”Boorman, who coached Biles from the age of seven until the end of the 2016 Olympics, said the American had experienced the twisties after feeling pressure at the 2015 world championships, where she won four golds.“[Three months after the 2015 world championships] Simone couldn’t twist – on basically anything,” Boorman writes. “… [She] would physically stop herself from twisting during her routines because she was afraid of getting lost in the air. Simone would never crash; she would just stop herself before ever attempting a twist.”Boorman said she did not want to rush Biles back into attempting twists but the gymnast eventually regained her ability to do so in time for the 2016 Olympic trials after talking with her family and therapist.“Thankfully the twisties had passed without injury,” Boorman writes, “and in the process, we demonstrated that an elite gymnast can avoid training elements for weeks without losing their skills.”Biles has not publicly commented on Boorman’s claims but wrote the foreword to the new book.Biles did not appear to have any issues with the twisties at the 2024 Olympics in Paris, where she won three golds. The 28-year-old has 11 Olympic medals and 30 from the world championships, making her the most decorated gymnast in history.She has not ruledout competing at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.Explore more on these topicsSimone BilesGymnasticsUS sportsRio 2016Tokyo Olympic Games 2020Olympic GamesnewsShareReuse this content"

It was the latest collaboration between rightwing US figures and McGregor, whom Donald Trumphosted at the White Houseon St Patrick’s Day.The Freemasons’ Hall, built in 1869, provided an elaborate, Victorian backdrop to the interview. In astatementat the weekend, Daley said the Freemasons routinely rented out the hall and took a booking from a US media company without initially knowing details of the event.“If the participants and content had been known the booking would not have been accepted. The Freemasons ofIrelandcategorically denies any association with the interviewer or interviewee and regrets that such an interview took place on our premises. We apologise to our members and confirm that steps have been taken to avoid a reoccurrence.”Daleytold RTÉthat the organisation learned details of the event about an hour before it took place. “When it came to my attention, I then debated with some of my colleagues. Would we cancel it or would we let it go ahead? And we decided in our wisdom that we just let it go,” he said.Daley said he allowed the interview to proceed after an assurance from Carlson’s company that all of the backgrounds would be blurred and that there would be no reference to the Freemasons’ Hall.Daley also said his organisation worried about a possible “backlash” if it cancelled the event. “In hindsight we’re not happy with that decision, I mean, look, we made a mistake, put my hands up, fully admit that.”Daley added: “I would not be a fan of Mr McGregor under any circumstances.” The fee, said to be between €1,000-€2,000, is to be donated to charity.In the interview, McGregor, said a corrupt governing elite was facilitating the “erasure” of Irish people and their identity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Scott Parker decided it was more sensible to chisel their way out, inch by inch, completing their route to freedom with a tense victory againstSheffield United.Amid the change of owners, mana­gers and styles the captain, Josh Brownhill, has been a mainstay and it was ­fitting his two goals completed the pains­taking job. Parker’s promotion push has been the polar ­opposite to ­Kompany’s approach. The ­Belgian’s ­all-conquering side played fast, aggressive, attacking football, whereas the current style is based on discipline and defensive organisation.Burnleyhave conceded 15 goals in 44 games, a record anyone would be proud of and the foundation of their success.Leeds promoted to Premier League after Piroe’s four-goal salvo in Stoke routRead moreIt was always going to be a nervous 90 minutes against Sheffield United, who started the match five points behind and maintained a chance of catching Burnley. The opening exchanges lacked quality but not aggression as the two teams wanted to show their desire for promotion. Late challenges were the norm until Gustavo Hamer was cautioned for a needless kick on Brownhill to gift the hosts a free-kick.From the set piece came the opener. The ball was worked out from the right to Marcus Edwards, whose cross belatedly landed at Josh Cullen’s feet. He aimed towards the corner, only for Michael Cooper to palm away. The waiting Brownhill smashed into the roof of the net, taking Turf Moor’s off in the same moment.Considering Burnley had not conceded twice in a league match all season, a turnaround was already a difficult task for Sheffield United, even with more than an hour to play. This was not a message received by Tom Cannon, whose smart run allowed him to latch on to Hamer’s pass and beat James Trafford with a ferocious strike. It was his first goal for the club since joining in January.Chris Wilder has looked frustrated in recent weeks as his side have slipped behind Burnley and Leeds. They were serious rivals for an automatic promotion spot, even ­favourites, before losing three matches in a row, a fatal error when the situation was so tight, hindered by lapses in concentration.The leveller increased the tension inside the stadium, although that was soon relieved when Anel Ahmedhodzic decided to kick Hannibal Mejbri up in the air inside the penalty area, leaving Wilder perplexed. Brownhill took responsibility, sending Cooper the wrong way to return the home support to a state of delirium. Brownhill punched the air with delight and encouraged more noise.Seeing things through is a core part of Parker’s strategy, exemplified by him taking off their most dangerous player in Edwards just after the hour mark and replacing him with the stoic central midfielder Josh Laurent. While Burnley were putting more behind the ball, Wilder sent on Tyrese Campbell and Jesurun Rak-Sakyi in search of an equaliser against a team offering up few chances.View image in fullscreenBrownhill and his teammates go wild with the home fans.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PATrafford has rebuilt his ­reputation as one of the country’s best young goalkeepers after struggling in ­Burnley’s error-ridden season in the top flight under Kompany, when they conceded an average of more than two a game. It has been very different this year with Connor ­Roberts, CJ Egan-Riley, Maxime Estève and Bashir Humphreys or Lucas Pires in front of him, but Trafford has still regularly produced vital saves, most notably in the goalless draw against Sunderland in January when he repelled two late penalties.There were no such big moments in this match as Trafford easily coped with everything thrown at him in the second half to leave Wilder with the tricky task of the playoffs. “We’ve ­finished third and we’ve taken it deep,” Wilder said. “We have to use this as fuel and motivation, reset and go again in the playoffs.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His previous two experiences resulted in him being relegated with Fulham and sacked after four games when in charge of Bournemouth. His ­complaint with the latter was that they did not have enough quality in the squad and Burnley will need to invest intelligently in the summer, and avoid losing any of his key men, if they are to compete, but they could be better equipped than Kompany’s version thanks to their defensive solidity.Last season’s promoted teams are all set to come back down with few points on the table, showing the ever growing gap between the divisions. Not that anyone celebrating the promotion was contemplating anything more than the immediate party.As the full-time whistle blew, the Burnley substitutes sprinted onto the pitch, soon joined by thousands of fans, leaping over the hoardings to join their heroes and antagonise the Blades. “It was quite scary,” Wilder said. “I don’t think we were protected by the football club or the stewards.”Parker made a quick escape to the stands to embrace his wife and speak with the club’s owners who believed in his vision. The smoke bombs from the pitch invaders left claret and blue clouds in the Lancashire sky. They immediately dissipated but the positivity did not.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipBurnleySheffield Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

That loss saw Leicester slump to a record ninth successive top-flight home defeat without scoring a goal.Acquiescence trumps apocalypse as Leicester’s demise is confirmed | Jonathan WilsonRead moreVardy, the Leicester captain, is out of contract at the end of the season and it is unclear whether the club will offer him a new deal. The 38-year-old signed a 12-month deal following promotion last summer.In a message posted on social media on Monday, Vardy said: “No words I have can ever express my feelings of anger and sadness with the way this season has gone. There are no excuses.“Collectively, as players and as a club, we failed. There is simply no hiding, and I refuse to entertain any suggestion of doing so. Having been at this club for so long, we’ve experienced so many highs and successes – and this season has been nothing but miserable and for me personally, a total embarrassment. It hurts, and I know you’re feeling it too.“To the fans: I’m sorry. Sorry we haven’t performed, and sorry we end the 2025 season with such a s*** show.”The former England striker, who joined the club from Fleetwood in a £1m deal in 2011, is regarded as one of Leicester’s greatest players having played a key role in winning thePremier League in 2015-16and theFA Cup in 2020-21.The future of Leicester manager Ruud van Nistelrooy is also uncertain, with the Dutchman expected to hold talks with the club’s hierarchy this week. He is under contract until 2027 but his position is in serious doubt.Leicester have sounded out potential successors in recent weeks. Van Nistelrooy said the club must make a quick decision to allow the team to progress. “The club has to use this time, otherwise you will waste it,” he said on Sunday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The last lap of an often gruelling and sometimes downright painful journey into the Premier League proved joyous and unexpectedly straightforward, the only frustration being a slight delay to the start of the formal celebrations.It was occasioned by the need to wait for the final score from Turf Moor, where Burnley beat Sheffield United to join Leeds in the top tier while consigning Chris Wilder’s side to the playoffs.Brownhill’s double sinks Sheffield United and earns promotion for BurnleyRead moreNot even heavy rain and a marked dip in the Easter temperature could dampen the euphoria inside Elland Road as Joël Piroe registered a hat‑trick inside the first 20 ­minutes. By half-time Daniel Farke’s ­centre‑forward had scored four times and Stoke were holed below the waterline.“I might have wanted a seventh goal but, apart from that, there’s not much more I could have asked for,” Farke said. “To deliver such an emphatic performance with feet on the gas all the time was amazing. The spirit and tenacity we’ve shown in recent weeks has been incredible.”Farke has now orchestrated a third promotion in a managerial career ­during which he has twice led ­Norwich into football’s promised land. “This is a priceless three points,” he said. “It was one of the best days; the ­atmosphere was ­electric. The ­players are tired but feeling the joy. The dressing room’s buzzing.”The demolition of Stoke started with a neat first-time Piroe finish after Manor Solomon’s flick. It continued when the Dutchman, cued up by the excellent Jayden Bogle, found time to switch the ball from his left to right foot before, again, shooting low beyond Viktor Johansson.View image in fullscreenLargie Ramazani of Leeds United celebrates promotion with his team mates.Photograph: Anna Gowthorpe/ShutterstockOnly eight minutes had passed and Leeds fans needed to wait another 12 before Piroe used his left foot to lash the ball into the roof of the net from close range after ­Johansson could only parry Wilfried Gnonto’s sliced shot.Piroe has his critics in West Yorkshire and there had been a bit of a clamour for Patrick Bamford to start ahead of him in the central ­striking role here, but the doubters were confounded. “Joël had a dry spell, a bit of a dip recently but, to his credit, he has got himself out of it,” Farke said. “He’s proven priceless for us this season but, for a striker, goals are like a bottle of ketchup; it all comes out at once.”Stoke’s defence looked more like a chocolate Easter egg that had begun to melt after being left too close to a ­radiator. Their backline turned to liquid long before ­Junior Firpo turned the fourth goal over the line after connecting with Bogle’s cross.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That decibel count increased as Bogle’s angled shot hit a post and Piroe’s bundled close-range finish lifted his season’s goal tally to 19.If it was most definitely Piroe’s party, Stoke were extremely ­unwilling guests. Slips were always possible on the wet playing surface but Mark ­Robins’s players ­frequently looked so off-balance they might as well have been playing on sheet ice.Visiting stability improved slightly in the second half after a flurry of substitutions and a switch to five at the back, but was soon undermined further as Gnonto met Solomon’s fine cross and headed the sixth goal.If the sight of Piroe being substituted might normally have offered Robins reason for relief, the sight of Bamford running on to replace him and Ao Tanaka and Ilia Gruev continuing to dictate central midfield, while Joe Rodon and Ethan Ampadu formed an impenetrable central defensive barrier, can hardly have prompted reassurance.Tellingly, Farke was so relaxed that he was able to offer Eddie Gray’s grandson, the extremely promising 16-year-old Harry Gray, a late debut from the bench.To say Robins was unimpressed by the events which unfolded in front of him is an understatement. “It was a game we didn’t take part in,” he said. “We didn’t lay a glove on Leeds. They’re the best team in theChampionshipwith the most talented group of ­players without a shadow of a doubt. They 100% deserve promotion.”Explore more on these topicsChampionshipLeeds UnitedStoke Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

A third ­successive promotion remains firmly in Wrexham’s sights after a near-perfect day for them in League One’s tumultuous automatic promotion race. Who writes their scripts?While their rivals Wycombe ­crumbled to a 4-0 home defeat against ­Charlton to topple out of the top two, ­Wrexham took full advantage, overpoweringBlackpoolwith a dominant ­second‑half display capped by quickfire goals from James McClean and Oliver Rathbone. Behind the champions Birmingham, the Welsh club are two points better off than the Chairboys on 86, with ­Charlton on 82 and Stockport, who beat ­Huddersfield, on 81.Wrexham are two wins from ­making English football history; no club has won three successive ­promotions in the top-five tiers. From non-league to the second tier in three years would be quite the journey.No wonder the visiting supporters came in their droves up the M6 for this one. The rowdy sold-out ­contingent of 2,000 away fans roared Phil Parkinson’s side on to triumph in a contest that might have proved another tripwire after Wrexham had drawn three of their past four.“There was a bit of negativity, I would imagine, after we didn’t win last week but the lads blocked that out,” Parkinson said. “And we’re not going to get carried away the other way because people will start ­thinking we’ve done the job now.”Quick GuideLeague One roundup: Stockport and Orient boost promotion hopesShowStockportremain just behind fourth-placed Charlton after Oliver Norwood's penalty earned them a 2-1 comeback win againstHuddersfield, with Callum Marshall dismissed for the Terriers minutes later.Sixth-placedLeyton Orientcame from behind to beat relegation-threatenedCambridge2-1 after Josh Stokes' opener was cancelled out by Charlie Kelman before Jamie Donley scored the winner.

Charlton’s and Stockport’s victories assure them of top-six finishes, while Leyton Orient and Reading, who won at Cambridge and Mansfield respectively, look set to battle for the final playoff spot.For all of Wrexham’s endeavour at Blackpool, they owe plenty to ­Charlton and that favourable result 220 miles away in Buckinghamshire. Not that Parkinson wanted to talk about favours from other clubs with ­Wrexham’s fate back in their own hands.If the news of the Addicks ­taking a 13th-minute lead at Wycombe caused a ripple of excitement among the Wrexham fans, their emotions ranged from near-ecstasy to disbelief when McClean raided through after a deft flick from Sam Smith but was denied by a point-blank Harry Tyrer save. With the goal at McClean’s mercy, it appeared simpler to score.View image in fullscreenWrexham's Oliver Rathbone (left) celebrates scoring his side's second goal of the game.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PACharlton got a second at Wycombe by the half-hour mark but ­Wrexham were struggling to find a way past Tyrer. George Dobson slipped in Jay Rodriguez but the veteran forward smacked his shot straight at the sprawling Blackpool keeper. Tyrer, the former Chester player, was unpopular among the travelling fans as they pondered those missed chances with the game goalless at the break.Parkinson would not divulge whether he told Wrexham’s players of the Wycombe score at half‑time. Either way, their motivation was plain to see. McClean, sensing this could be his defining Wrexham moment, sent a towering header just over.

But as they falter, Aston Villa have seemingly found another gear.Liverpool are secure in the Champions League qualification slots and Arsenal soon will be, which leaves the remaining three places between five contenders who are separated by just two points, although Nottingham Forest face Tottenham on Monday. Forest, though, have won just three of their last eight in the league. Newcastle had won six in a row in all competitions before Saturday’s 4-1 defeat to Villa. Manchester City are unbeaten in five in the league. Chelsea have won five of their last 11 in the league and have a notably tough run-in. But Villa have won 10 of 11 in all competitions, the only blip their Champions League defeat away to Paris Saint-Germain. There is no question that they are the side in form.Villa’s performance in beating Newcastlewas one of their best under Unai Emery, perhaps not quite as good as in last season’s 1-0 win over Manchester City, but just as relentless, just as remorseless. There was an intensity and ferocity Newcastle couldn’t live with. Their stand-in manager, Jason Tindall, blamed the fact his side had had to play three games in six days – which up to a point is fair enough; everybody is exhausted. But Newcastle have not played European football this season, while Villa had just fought through a gruelling Champions League quarter-final second leg against PSG on Tuesday, and have an FA Cup semi-final to come against Crystal Palace next Saturday. Fatigue is an excuse for everybody – and thus for nobody.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreIt was also striking how cleverly Villa played, repeatedly going direct to Ollie Watkins to bypass the Newcastle press, and focusing their attacks down their left (almost four times as many as down the right), targeting the space behind Newcastle’s Kieran Trippier. This, like so much of Villa’s progress over the past three years, was a triumph for Emery. Even his insistence that Villa should be “angry” after their Champions League exit, brilliantly well as they played, proved a masterstroke. It would have been very easy for Villa to be flat on Saturday, for there to be a sense of anticlimax; instead they produced their best performance of the season.Received wisdom has it that January signings are best avoided, that they are a sign of desperation. Villa turned that theory on its head. Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio in particular have added edge and dynamism, while Donyell Malen has also weighed in with a couple of useful goals. But perhaps most significantly, they have added depth. Where other sides have tired, Villa have a bench that has given them variety and freshness. Watkins admitted to being furious not to start either PSG game; the result was that, fuelled by the desire to prove a point, he played with zip and drive and scored within the first minute against Newcastle.Whether Villa will be able to sign Rashford or Asensio on a permanent basis is unclear. Quite apart from anything else, Manchester United may decide they don’t want to let Rashford go, now he has been rejuvenated. Villa lost £85.9m ($114m) in the last financial year, the biggest deficit of any English club, taking losses over the past three years to £206m, well beyond the £105m threshold for SPR compliance. There are, though, £90m of acceptable deductions, and a tweak to their accounting period probably brings themjust insidethe limits. But they are close to the line, which could restrict spending in the short term and qualification for the Champions League would give them additional breathing space.The owners, Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens, who bought the club completely from Tony Xia in August 2019, may have invested heavily, but there is still disquiet among fans, both about ticket prices and the way certain sections of the ground have been reallocated for corporate guests. This is a huge gripemore generally in the Premier League. Returning from Anfield last week, I heard two US visitors expressing bewilderment that the market didn’t just take its course which, given demand, would inflate prices three or fourfold for the top clubs. From a purely capitalistic point of view, of course, they are right, but football clubs in England have always been more than soulless vehicles for the enrichment of their owners; it’s only this new breed of owners who disdain their community role, what they mean for the people brought up in the shadows of their stadiums whose families have been going for generations.However valid those concerns about the ownership may be, though, they are at least partially quelled when there is success on the pitch. And Villa, at the moment, are playing extremely good football under an extremely good manager. Back-to-back qualifications for the Champions League would go a long way towards establishing the club among the elite.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Alexander-Arnold’s winner – the first left-footed goal of 23 in his career – put Liverpool on the verge of a 20th league title.Van Dijk pushed the 26-year-old, who is expected to leave for Real Madrid this summer, towards theLiverpoolsupporters after the final whistle and Alexander-Arnold clenched his fists in celebration.Alexander-Arnold critics ‘ridiculous’ says Slot after Liverpool edge closerRead moreLiverpool will seal the Premier League on Wednesday if Arsenal lose at home to Crystal Palace, and can otherwise secure it at home against Tottenham on Sunday. The Liverpool captain said it was “past my wildest dreams” to be 13 points clear at this stage.“I think we forget that we are dealing with a human being,” Van Dijk said of Alexander-Arnold, who returned from an ankle injury. “Sometimes he goes through so many moments in the last couple of months and everyone will have an opinion on the way he’s obviously been. There’s a lot of noise around him and obviously everyone can argue if it’s his own fault, [but] it’s just part of life nowadays.“So when he scores a big goal like that, I think he deserves applause for stepping up in that particular moment and to soak it all in because whether he stays or leaves, these are moments which you shouldn’t take for granted to give us as a team the opportunity to finish it off. So I think he deserved that moment and now it’s back to work and be ready for the weekend.”Asked whether he had spoken to Alexander-Arnold about his future, Van Dijk replied: “I think he was under a lot of pressure already so there’s no point for me to put him on the spot.”Liverpool’s players will report for training on Wednesday after two days off. Van Dijk said Slot deserves praise for taking Liverpool to the “next level” and seamlessly adapting from life at Feyenoord and the Eredivisie in his first season in charge.“We also shouldn’t forget that we already were a team that was fighting up until April last year, so we had the quality, we couldn’t finish it off, and this year we have found that next level in terms of consistency and finding a way.“But listen, the staff deserve all the credit as well. Coming from Holland, to adapt so quickly, to improve so many players in the way we play, giving confidence in the way we play without a pre-season as well [because of the schedule last summer] and without signings, really.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The manager stated the youngster’s next challenge was to prove he is physically robust enough always to be available.“Now we have one game a week. He has to see if he can play every three days, like for example, Bernardo [Silva] has proven, or Kevin [De Bruyne] has proven, or Rúben [Dias] has proven,” said Guardiola. “I admire that he’s playing a position he’s never played before, he’s learning.

Even afterwards, if you looked at the numbers below the top line it hardly seemed a game to make you leap from your seat.Yet few first halves have scrambled perception and expectation as much as Union Berlin’s meeting with Stuttgart on Saturday evening. Fifty-one minutes and 48 seconds which bedazzled and befuddled in equal measure at Stadion An der Alten Försterei, the claustrophobic arena known for unrelenting atmosphere, emotion but very few goals. In this first half, Union matched a third of the goals they had already scored at home all season, taking their season tally in their yard from 12 to 16. It was the first time a Bundesliga game has ever contained eight first-half goals; four, in this case, for each side.Let’s be clear: it was a bit of a fluke. The xG numbers at half-time were as perplexing as the actual score, with 0.78 playing 0.68. Some of the goals, as that would suggest, were netbusters, from trusted sources like the left boot of the sublime Enzo Millot for the visitors, and from less expected providers like Leopold Querfeld. Union’s young Austrian centre-back smashed their third into the top corner from a long way out; when Querfeld’s captain, Christopher Trimmel, suggested afterwards he should now be on free-kick duty, it was unclear whether he was joking). By the end of a goalless second half – and many of the regulars were probably grateful for the chance to catch their breath – only Union of the two nudged their xG figure over one, more typically from a sum total of 22% possession. The game had delighted and defied reason.So on the day when Union marked their 200thBundesligagame and their 100th at home, they got the point that made mathematically sure of survival and a seventh straight season in the top flight. That they made certain against Stuttgart, the team they squeezed past on away goals back in 2019’s relegation playoff, made it all the more special. Stuttgart have recovered from that relegation with some aplomb, accelerating under the stewardship of Sebastian Hoeness to last term’s pinnacle of Bundesliga runners-up and Champions League participation. Failure to win here all but guaranteed they will not be returning to the top table of European competition next season, and this underlined both why that is the case, and why they will be a loss to it.Last month’s signing of a new extension with Hoeness, tying him toStuttgartuntil 2028, is the best bit of business the club will do all year. The former Hoffenheim manager has not only dragged the team up while losing good players all the way, but has done it playing brave, front-foot football. This was in evidence during the first half in Köpenick. Two-nil down, and then 3-2 down in the 42nd minute, Stuttgart were close to taking a 4-3 lead into half-time before Andrej Ilic nodded in his second for the hosts.View image in fullscreenAndrej Ilic scores Hoffenheim’s fourth goal just before half-time.Photograph: Annegret Hilse/ReutersFor Stuttgart, it’s been a season of challenges: showing they can deal with the increase in pressure, the higher-level games, the fuller calendar. Hoeness’s side created opportunities to do something extraordinary only to then let it slip; impressing indefeat by Real Madridat the Bernabéu in September, seeing a two-goal lead evaporate against Leverkusen this time last month or climbing the mountain here in Berlin before slipping to fall face down in the mud.Deniz Undav, whose permanent signing from Brighton was the big transfer market win coming into this season, is perhaps symbolic of it all. He scored with a typically smart finish here, but it was his first goal since January, and the Germany striker was only in the XI because Nick Woltemade was suspended. After the game, Undav accepted he has found it difficult to block out “negative and critical voices” this season. Yet there is still plenty to take from the campaign, with a clear path to Europe in the DfB Pokal final against Arminia Bielefeld, even if the third-tier side have already eliminated a clutch of Bundesliga teams, including Union in the second round and Leverkusen in the semis.If Stuttgart have struggled with vastly adjusted expectations and demands, Union have written the book on it in recent years, from being the first club from the old East Berlin to reach the Bundesliga to qualifying for the Champions League themselves, signing players like Max Kruse, Robin Gosens, Leonardo Bonucci and Kevin Volland, while losing legendary coach Urs Fischer along the way. This, they hope, will be looked back upon as a difficult season of recalibration.View image in fullscreenChris Fuhrich celebrates after scoring Stuttgart’s fourth goal.Photograph: Maryam Majd/Reuters“That was hard work,” exhaled Steffen Baumgart, the coach who looked as if he had inherited too stiff a task when he arrived in winter and walked straight into a shambolic, deflating defeat by Heidenheim in his first game. Baumgart was a player here between 2002 and 2004 – “I was here when Union wanted to be in the Bundesliga 10 years later,” he laughed, “though [they were] in the Oberliga [fifth tier] at the time” – and this clearly means so much to him. He appears the perfect person to continue regrounding Union and it will continue. One of the stars that didn’t quite work out, Volland announced his return to his first club, 1860 Munich, on Easter Monday – perhaps persuaded by his time at Union that reconnection with self is a worthy path.Ultimately, that is what this record-breaking afternoon was: self-affirmation and a thankfulness for what has been for both clubs. After the years of plenty, there is great joy to be taken in still just being here.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bayern recovered from their Champions League elimination with a breeze of a 4-0 win at Heidenheim, Harry Kane opening the scoring with his 24th league goal of the season).

The World Test Championship, the book argues, is a “shambles masquerading as a showpiece”.The publication of the sport’s annual bible is timely, with the future of the WTC discussed recently at ICC meetings in ­Zimbabwe. In typically opaque fashion, the sport’s governing body is yet to announce the outcome of the debate.Nat Sciver-Brunt lined up to be next England captain by new coach EdwardsRead moreSources suggest the 2025-27 WTC is likely to remain the same, with nine teams and an asymmetrical two‑year fixture list producing two finalists. Writing in his notes the Wisden editor, Lawrence Booth, has made the case for a four-year all‑play‑all format, highlighting South Africa’s spot in the final at Lord’s this summer despite a paltry diet of two-match series and having faced neither ­England nor Australia en route.“Among the first items in [the ICC chair Jay] Shah’s in-tray ought to be the World Test ­Championship, a shambles masquerading as a ­showpiece,” Booth writes. “This is not South Africa’s fault. It may even be to their benefit, if the path from laughing stocks to Lord’s persuades their board that Test cricket is worth saving.“The ICC cannot allow the championship to continue as if designed on the back of a fag packet. Double its length to four years, like football and rugby, and ensure the top nine in the rankings all play each other, home and away, over series of at least three Tests.”The catch, as ever, is India’s ongoing refusal to play in Pakistan on geopolitical grounds – something that came to a head during the recentChampions ­Trophywhen Rohit Sharma’s eventual winners were based in Dubai for the entire tourna­ment. This in turn highlighted India’s domi­nance at board level, with Shah having switched from secretary of the Board of ­Control for Cricket in India to ICC chair last December while the issue was being debated.Booth writes: “The communal shrug [that met Shah’s appointment] confirmed a sorry truth: 2024 was the year cricket gave up any claim to being properly administered, with checks, balances, and governance for the many, not the few. India already had the monopoly: now they had hotels on Park Lane and Mayfair.”Elsewhere Wisden features moving first-person tributes to Graham Thorpe by Alec Stewart and Thorpe’s wife, Amanda, with the latter keen to raise awareness and understanding of the depression and anxiety that led the former England batter to take his own life last August. “Some people say suicide is selfish,” Amanda Thorpe writes. “But I have so much compassion for what he went through. He didn’t deserve it. No one does.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Does venting emotion harm performance in elite sport? | Sean IngleRead more“For now there is no real thing set in stone but we’re taking it week to week and he’s helping me as much as he can alongside his current commitments.”Raducanu had arrived at the Miami Open last month on a trial with the Slovak coach Vladimir Platenik before opting to dissolve their prospective partnership onthe eve of the tournament. She instead enlisted the help of Petchey, Andy Murray’s former coach, who was in Miami for his role as a broadcaster on the Tennis Channel. They were joined there by the former player Jane O’Donoghue, Raducanu’s close friend. The 22-year-old enjoyed their time together so much that she has continued their partnership despite significant obstacles.After Miami, which was her seventh tournament in two months, Raducanu withdrew from the Billie Jean King Cup and the WTA 250 event in Rouen in order to “rest and recover” while executing a 10-day training block with Petchey in Los Angeles.“We created our own little bubble and it was nice to be working on my game out there but at the same time having fun and enjoying it,” she said.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu celebrates defeating Emma Navarro during her run to the quarter-finals of the Miami Open.Photograph: SMG/ShutterstockPetchey will be in Madrid this week,along with O’Donoghue, but Raducanu stated that he is “fitting me in around” his other commitments. Still, she is satisfied: “I’m happy with the set-up going forward right now – it’s been working well. I like him a lot and I’ve known him since before the US Open and it’s nice to have familiar faces around.”Like many of Raducanu’s choices, opting to work informally with a coach is unconventional. She says that it has been difficult to handle the scrutiny she has been under every time she makes a decision but she is slowly learning how to block out the noise and lean on the people around her. “It’s really difficult, because I think every decision I make is made on such a big scale that it’s up for judgment,” she said.“Every time I step on the court, every time I kind of make a choice, it is up for judgment. And I just need to get to a place where I’m comfortable enough and secure enough in what I’m doing that it doesn’t matter what other people are saying.“Over the last few years, that is, truthfully, something that I have been kind of toiling with, because I would care about what people think. I think just in general, in my life, like anytime someone’s upset with me or something, it affects me.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And that way I can express myself and, not even about the tennis, just feel a better person, just feel happier and lighter.”As she stressed throughout the run, Raducanu believes that the lesson fromher performances in Miamiis to ensure that finds enjoyment in her daily life while also pursuing her goals: “I think I’m just trying to keep things more lighthearted off the court, like I’m getting on site, and then trying to just get on get off, like, pretty soon,” she said.“That has helped me, and then just doing things outside that makes me happy. Like, for example, yesterday I just did a yoga class. It was just random.“I’ll go on hikes. I’ll just do things that maybe, like, in the moment, or previously, I would be like: ‘Oh, maybe it’s not so professional; I need to just be locked in like, 200% of my day.’ But now I’m a lot more like: ‘No,’ because when I’m locked in I am so focused on the court, I give 200%.

More time will tell, but the initial testing is very favorable. No fractures of any sort. I mean, he got a little bit of a laceration on his jawline, so we are worried about his jaw. We are worried about his cervical region. Everything was clear, stable on the initial testing.”However, Shildt was cautious about the initial results of testing.“We’ve been burned before on testing, so we will be cautiously optimistic,” he said. “He did have a period where he wasn’t aware of where he was, so that’s clearly concerning. Everything is coming back to him now, and his initial testing from a concussion standpoint was favorable, but clearly, we are not out of the woods. All things considered, that’s a blessing.”It’s a girl!

As Dubón covered the base, he appeared to accidentally hit Arraez in the face with his elbow. Both players fell to the ground, but Arraez took the worst of it, laying motionless as staff from both teams came out to tend to him.“It was scary,” Dubón said. “I mean, just watching him not move. It was scary. Especially people know the type of player I am. I’m not a dirty player or anything. So it sucks. Worst part about it is you get death threats from stuff like this and everything. So it’s going to be a fun ride home.”Arraez was placed on a backboard and carted out of the stadium. As he was being placed on the cart, Arraez put his arm around Shildt.“It was a sad moment, especially getting close to him and seeing him on the ground like that, you definitely get scared,” said San Diego’s Fernando Tatis Jr, who hit the tiebreaking home run in the game. “You almost go into tears but holding up. You sit down right next to him and start praying for him right away. Happy he is back with us already. Just happy, he’s standing up. It’s a sad part of the game, but stuff happens sometimes. Just happy he’s alright.”Tatis, who was running to second on the play, said he heard the collision. “As soon as they called timeout, I went to see my boy and see what was going on,” he said.Dubón said he knows Arraez. “It sucks just having that play on him and everything,” he said. “Like I said before, there’s nothing I could have done. I braced myself and I thought I was going to get the worst out of it. I mean, I’m not a big guy.”Play resumed after a 10-minute delay.

With their bags of crisps piled high in front of them, they crowd around a couple of smartphones to sing along to Mandopop ballads. The sound of their laughter rings out across the surrounding lawn – until it is pierced by a mechanical buzzing sound. Someone has ordered dinner.A few metres away from the impromptu karaoke session is an “airdrop cabinet”, one of more than 40 in Shenzhen that is operated by Meituan, China’s biggest food delivery platform. Hungry park-goers can order anything from rice noodles to Subway sandwiches to bubble tea.A drone, loaded up with goods from a shopping mall less than three kilometres away, flies into view, and earshot, hovering over the delivery station for a moment, before steadily lowering and depositing the goods into a sealed box that can only be unlocked by entering the customer’s phone number. Dinner is served with not a human in sight. Meituan aims to beat human delivery times by about 10%, although perhaps because of its journey whizzing through the clouds in a thin polystyrene box, the food, char siu pork and a waffle, is slightly cold.View image in fullscreenA drone takes off from a rooftop of a shopping mall on 03 April 2025 in Shenzhen, China.Photograph: Anthony Kwan/The GuardianThe drones are a small part of the broader robotics and artificial intelligence industry that China is intent on expanding on this year.With atrade war raging, demographic challenges dragging on the economy and the prospect of a productive relationship with the world’s largest economy lookingever more remote, Beijing is doubling down on the industries where it sees the potential – and the need – to develop ahead of the US. China’s leaders see artificial intelligence as being the key toupgrading its military strength, solving the problems created by a shrinking workforce, and a source of national pride – especially when Chinese firms manage to circumvent US-led sanctions on core technology. And technology firms, for many years shunned by China’s leader, Xi Jinping, as he sought to crack down on excessive wealth and influence outside the Chinese Communist party’s control, are beingwelcomed back into the foldas Xi seeks to restore confidence in the private sector and encourage domestic innovation.In March, Premier Li Qiang promised to “unleash the creativity of the digital economy”, with a particular focus on “embodied AI”. Guangdong, which includes the tech hub of Shenzhen, is at the forefront of this movement. The provincial government recently announced 60m yuan (£6.4m) in new funding for innovation centres. Shenzhen in particular is known as China’s drone capital, because of the authorities’ progressive approach to drone regulations, allowing the “low altitude economy” to develop faster than in other parts of the country. China’s Civil Aviation Administration predicts that the value of the sector will increase five-fold to 3.5tn yuan in the next decade.It is not just drones that are promising – or threatening – to upend the tempo of urban life in China. Humanoid robots are particularly buzzy. The highlight of this year’s Spring festival gala, which was viewed nearly 17bn times, wasa dance performed by a troupe of humanoid robotsmade by a company called Unitree. On Saturday, the world’s first humanoid v human race – a half marathon – took place on the outskirts of Beijing.View image in fullscreenA robot taking part in Saturday’s race.Photograph: Ng Han Guan/AP“Applying artificial intelligence to robots basically really kicked into high gear last year,” says Rui Ma, a China technology analyst and investor based in San Francisco. The shift could allow the industry to growat a much faster rate in 2025 than in previous years. Reinforcement learning, which means training robots to learn from experience rather than relying on rigid models, allows humanoid robots to be trained in months rather than years, hastening the pace of innovation. Toy robot dogs are already part of daily life in China. At a wholesale market in Yiwu, a trading hub in east China’s Zhejiang province, a child plays with a robot dog while his mother haggles with exporters over the price of false eyelashes. On thestreets of Shanghai, a woman walks her robot dog, which is helpfully carrying a basket of shopping on its back.View image in fullscreenA drone operated by Meituan, loaded up with goods, takes off from a rooftop of a shopping on 03 April 2025 in Shenzhen, China.Photograph: Anthony Kwan/The GuardianThe development of China’s robotics industry is intimately linked to advances in AI. For years, China has been trying to catch up with the United States. Xi wants to drive economic growth through “new quality productive forces”, a concept that includes advanced technologies.Many in Washington fear that the US’s lead is narrowing. One major tool in the US’s arsenal has been its control over the important parts of the supply chain for semiconductors, the microchips used to train advanced AI models. The US restricts the export of the most sophisticated chips to China, part of a strategy described by former national security adviser Jake Sullivan as “high fence” around the US’s most strategically valuable technology.But in January, a previously unknown Chinese firm calledDeepSeekset the Chinese tech scene alight with the release of a large language reasoning model, R1, which performs as well as leading US competitors, at a fraction of the price. The model sparked a stock market crash,with $1tn wiped off Wall Street’s leading tech indexas investors feared that the US’s pole position in the tech race was no longer guaranteed.“You can’t really overemphasise how crazy of a moment that was,” says Ma.Since then, China’s AI industry has been brimming with optimism. It was already being promoted by the government as the answer to China’s long term, sustainable growth, and now, says Ma, the public has started to believe it too.View image in fullscreenA Meituan drone drops off an order at an ‘airdrop cabinet’ in Shenzhen, China.Photograph: MeituanLi Shuhao, a tech entrepreneur based in Guangzhou who founded an AI marketing company, Tec-Do, in 2017, was in the United States when the DeepSeek moment happened. All of a sudden, “it was way easier for me to arrange interviews and arrange meetings with other AI scientists,” he says.“DeepSeek is kind of a symbol for the Oriental way of doing business,” says Li, a self-confessed “metalhead”, surrounded by electric guitars and a drum kit in his office in Guangzhou. He is referring to the strategy pursued by Liang Wenfeng, DeepSeek’s founder, of financing it through his own hedge fund rather than seeking external venture capital funding. “This is how typical Chinese entrepreneurs think. Just survive first, then do something new.”DeepSeek published its work as open source, a principle that the government has long favoured and a move which has encouraged widespread adoption of its model. Robotics has been a particular beneficiary.Putting tech firstThe robotics supply chain can loosely be divided into three areas: the brain, the body, and the application of the technology in the real world. China has long been confident in its ability in the latter two areas – advanced supply chains in other hi-tech industries such as electric vehicles and autonomous drones show that China has both the capacity to produce industrial components at scale and the knowhow to assemble them into complex goods. But solving the trickiest part of the puzzle, making a robot brain that can learn human-like behaviours and movements, has been elusive. It requires sophisticated AI.DeepSeek’s R1 model changed the game, paving a way for domestic humanoid robotics companies to catch up with overseas competitors, said analysts at Goldman Sachs in a recent note. The fact that DeepSeek’s open-source model uses less advanced chips helps level the playing field for Chinese companies.View image in fullscreenAn engineer trains a humanoid robot at the humanoid robot innovation center at Shougang Park on March 28, 2025 in Beijing, China.Photograph: Beijing Youth Daily/VCG/Getty ImagesThe industry is still fraught with challenges. Any AI model requires reams of data for training. While LLMs used for things like chatbots can draw upon the vast universe of content that is the internet, the data for robotic AI models, such as information on how to physically move through space and interact with objects or people, is relatively scarce.In the world of autonomous vehicles, another sector that China is focusing on, a car needs to be able to navigate through six axes, or “degrees of freedom”: forwards and backwards, left and right, up and down, and the rotations between these positions. The same goes for general robotics, such as Meituan’s food delivery drones. For a humanoid robot to be able to mimic a human in everyday tasks, such as cooking, it needs up to 60 degrees of freedom. Unitree’s H1 model that caused a splash at the Spring Gala has 27.Robots don’t need to be fully humanoid to be useful. Robots on wheels or humanoids with limited motion can still take on tasks that are ripe for automation, such as dangerous or repetitive factory jobs. UBTech, a Shenzhen-based company, already supplies humanoid robots to car factories. With a shrinking workforce, China is keen to find ways to automate wherever possible.At last month’s Boao Forum for Asia, a business conference, organisers were keen to dish outjianbing,a savoury pancake that is a typical Chinese street food, made by a robotic arm in a booth, similar to the claws that collect stuffed toys in an arcade (the resulting snack was not as crispy as a human-made offering). Parks in Beijing have ramped up their surveillance abilities by sticking cameras on autonomous buggies which drive along the paths.View image in fullscreenHumanoid robots perform at the opening ceremony of the 2025 Zhongguancun Forum (ZGC Forum) Annual Conference, in Beijing, capital of China, March 27, 2025.Photograph: Xinhua/REX/Shutterstock“Robots are not replacing the vast majority of the labour force,” says Amber Zhang, a product manager at BigOne Lab, a Beijing-based data intelligence firm. “For instance, if you look at robot taxis, how many cab drivers are actually getting replaced? There are still a lot of hurdles”.In a handful of cities across China, the tech company Baidu operates fleets of autonomous taxis, called Apollo Go, or robotaxis. But a recent attempt by the Guardian to hail a ride in Shenzhen was foiled twice: the robotaxis only operate in one district of the city, and when the Guardian tried to order one there, the wait was nearly 20 minutes before the app apologised and said that none could be found. A human-driven taxi turned up within four minutes. Robocops, touted by state media as a way of beefing up Shenzhen’s security apparatus, are nowhere to be seen.But it’s undeniable that the narrative has shifted. With other sectors of China’s economy facing significant challenges –exports are under pressure from tariffs; consumer demand remains weak – the government is keen to back a winning horse. “Now that real estate is no longer a source of revenue for many local governments, they have to attract good companies and support what they are doing,” Zhang says.View image in fullscreenA robotaxi autonomous vehicle waits at a traffic light in Chongqing, China, February 15, 2025Photograph: CFOTO/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesThe story of technology underpinning growth “is clicking for people,” says Ma, “and it’s also partly because, where else can then invest?”That is a marked shift from just a few years ago, when tech bosses were pushed to the sidelines as Xi cracked down on excessive wealth and influence in the private sector. The sudden cancellation in 2020 of an IPO by Ant Group, an affiliate of Alibaba, sent a chill through the technology and finance sectors, as did the fall from grace of Alibaba’s founder, Jack Ma.But Ma was recently invited toa rare in-person meetingwith Xi, along with other tech bosses including DeepSeek’s Liang, as Xi tried show that tech entrepreneurs are back in fashion.Such meetings “give us confidence” says Li. “Maybe the bad time has ended”.Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificArtificial intelligence (AI)featuresShareReuse this content"

Drones cannot be flown “beyond visual line of sight” under current regulations, making their use for lengthy journeys impossible.In an interview with the Guardian, Lord Willetts, chair of the Regulatory Innovation Office (RIO), said the changes could come as soon as 2026, but that they would apply in “atypical” aviation environments at first, which would mean remote areas and over open water.Referring to the NHS, Willetts said there was potentially a huge market for drone operators. “It’s great for drone operators commercially, but it’s also great for services like the NHS,” he said.Drones could be used to deliver drugs to GPs and patients in remote locations, and to take blood samples to hospitals for testing, he said.The Scottish Highlands and islands could be one area of the UK to benefit, as could farming as a sector, he added. Regulatory changes could enable the use of drones under the government’s safer streets fund, which supports measures against neighbourhood crime and antisocial behaviour.“You could imagine that, for the safer streets initiative, they might be used by the police in circumstances where they might be trying to ensure public safety,” he said.Willetts also indicated that the definition of an “atypical” air environment could be broadened, which could enable greater use of drones over long distances. The definition could “cover a lot of airspace”, he said.For drones to operate in busier airspace, however, there would need to be progress on technology and standards that alert aircraft to their presence.Citing deliveries to oil rigs and the maintenance of offshore wind turbines as another example of potential use by 2026, Willetts said that “strictly speaking” using a drone to check on a turbine involved a line-of-sight requirement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Willetts said regulations had become disproportionate.The NHS already delivers urgent pathology items such as blood samples via drones as part of a trial in central London. It involves moving samples between Guy’s hospital and a lab at St Thomas’ hospital in partnership with the drone companies Apian – a UK startup co-founded by NHS doctors – and Wing, which is owned by Google’s parent company Alphabet. A similar trial has also taken place in Northumberland.The UK technology secretary, Peter Kyle, said the regulatory changes would help the UK “lead the world in new technologies”.“These are exactly the kinds of barriers we’re determined to break down through the Regulatory Innovation Office,” he said. “Cutting red tape so drones can safely deliver supplies or inspect offshore wind turbines without costly workarounds like putting someone in a boat.”Explore more on these topicsDrones (non-military)NHSnewsShareReuse this content"

A decade ago, sim-only deals were far less prevalent, it says.Joe Gardiner, an analyst at the firm, says moving to a sim-only deal allows consumers to save a significant amount of money as they don’t have to pay off the value of the bundled device.“In 2024, 4.4m new phones were sold sim-free in the UK … because more customers are buying phones from non-carrier channels such as direct from the manufacturer, like Apple or Samsung,” he says.So asmid-contract price rises come in for many, how can you take advantage of a sim-only deal?Why should you change?Although it has been the norm in the past, people are realising that buying a mobile phone and the contract for minutes and data allowance together does not usually make the best sense. As you are tied to a contract for up to two years, you are restricted when it comes to moving to a better deal, and you can be paying off the handset for three years.At the time of writing, Vodafone was offering an iPhone 16 Pro as part of a bundle with 5GB of data and unlimited calls and texts for £37 a month. But after the cost of the phone is taken away, the usage fees were £13 a month. A sim-only deal with the telecoms firm Lebara, with similar allowances, cost £1 a month for the first seven months and £4.90 after that, as part of a deal with the website MoneySavingExpert.Research from the comparison site Uswitch found that the savings from switching can stretch to up to £350 a year if you are happy to continue using your current phone.“Many deals offer flexible one-month contracts with generous data allowances, so you can use your data stress-free without being tied in long-term,” says Simrat Sharma at Uswitch. “You can also get some great perks with a sim-only deal, like free EU roaming and entertainment packages.”More people are now buying their phones straight from the manufacturer, says Gardiner. And an increased consumer focus on sustainability means the secondhand market is thriving, he says, while others simply don’t think they need to keep changing handset because improvements in successive generations of smartphones are now relatively small.“Recent research found that the average replacement age of a mobile phone is four years,” he says.More players, more valueThere are more providers in the market for people to choose from, thanks to so-called mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs): these are third-party companies that offer services via deals with the biggest operators. Companies such as iD Mobile, giffgaff, Lycamobile and Tesco Mobile all operate on the infrastructure of the main networks such as Vodafone and O2.View image in fullscreenCompanies such as iD Mobile, giffgaff, Lyca Mobile and Tesco Mobile all operate on the infrastructure of the main networks.Photograph: Michał Fludra/AlamyThese smaller players are eclipsing the bigger ones in terms of flexibility and customer service as well as price, according to a survey by the consumer group Which?Smarty, which does not offer handsets or fixed-term contracts, came out top, followed by Voxi and Talkmobile. Which? found that while rolling contracts from the big four networks – Vodafone, O2, EE and Three – started at £19, consumers can get more data from the smaller operators in deals costing from £5.Natalie Hitchins at Which? says: “Many offers include EU roaming and rolling monthly deals so you have the flexibility to switch and, unlike the big providers, most smaller providers don’t impose mid-contract price hikes, so you won’t have any unexpected changes to your bill.”The best offers on the marketUswitch reckons the best-value sim-only deal on the market is one from Talkmobile with unlimited data costing £16 a month, with a contract length of one month.In second place was one from O2 which offers 175GB a month for £14 – but you have to sign up for a year. iD Mobile has a deal costing £9 for 108GB, again on a one-month contract. Talkmobile has a deal that costs £7.95 for 60GB, and Three has a one-year deal at £7 a month offering 40GB.People looking at switching would be wise to focus on how much data they use – the details are available on the settings of your phone – as the amount you require may be far below the capacity you are paying for.How to switchCheck if you are still in contract by texting “INFO” to 85075. If there are early exit fees, it will probably be sensible to wait until the end of the contract before switching.If you are in a “split contract” deal, where the data and phone contracts end at different times, know when the usage deal finishes so that you can have the freedom to move.Not everyone can afford to simply shell out for a new phone when they need or want one, but there are other options apart from buying via a bundled agreement. Some retailers such as Apple offer interest-free finance on repayments, and there is the possibility of using a 0% credit card. Avoid contracts that charge interest.If you switch, you can keep your old mobile number by texting “PAC” to 65075 for free. You will get a PAC code which can then be given to the new provider.Explore more on these topicsMobile phonesThe ObserverConsumer affairsSaving moneySmartphonesTelecomsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A study published last year by a US financial services company, Bread Financial, found 26% of people felt they were “financially incompatible” with their friends, while 21% said they had lost a friendship because of money.According to Talia Loderick, a money coach, the wealth gap between friends is something more people should be mindful of. “It’s so easy to let friendships fall by the wayside because we’re so awkward and money’s so emotional,” she says.When dining with friends, it is important to understand everyone’s views on how the costs should be divvied up before you split the bill. This is a topic that divides opinion. When the comparison website Compare the Market carried out a survey of diners, it found 34% thought a bill should be split evenly, including the tip, while 36% said it should be divided according to who had what.Vivi Friedgut is the founder and chief executive ofBlackbullion, a free-to-use money management app for students. She says that whether it is splitting the cost of household items or eating out, it is vital to have open and honest conversations right at the outset to make sure that “everyone is clear that somebody is fully paying, or that everything is being split across the group equally”.… especially at universityView image in fullscreenVivi Friedgut, the founder and chief executive of Blackbullion, says it is vital to have open and honest conversations right at the outset.Photograph: RooM the Agency/AlamyTom Allingham, communications director at the money websiteSave the Student, says: “People will often say, ‘I’ll get this, and you get the next thing.’ But what you find over time is that that doesn’t even out. So it might be that one of you gets one dinner and that might be £50, then the other one gets the next dinner. But that might only be £20.” Over time, what can happen is “one of you ends up being far more in the red than the other”, he adds.According to the most recent Save the Student data, the typical maintenance loan that most students take onfalls £504 shorteach month of covering the average living costs. That could create issues for some more than others within the same friendship group when it comes to splitting costs.Use an appView image in fullscreenApps can take the hassle out of dividing the bill.Photograph: UrbanImages/AlamyThere are a growing number of bill-splitting apps and services that take the hassle out of dividing expenses between lots of people. You may want to look at a few to figure out which one(s) work best for your particular circumstances.The best-known bill-splitting app is probablySplitwise. Launched in 2011, it enables you to keep track of unpaid bills, rent, holiday, food and travel costs and other shared expenses.Splitwise works as an IOU app whereby you sign up and create a group. Then you and your friends can start adding expenses. To do this, go to your group on the app, then hit the “add bill” button. You will be asked for various details about the expense, such as the total cost, who paid and how much each person owes. When you hit “save”, the app will update everyone’s balances.To settle up, UK users normally have to exit the app and go to their banking app or website to initiate payment, or hand over some physical cash, then return to Splitwise to confirm they have paid.No one likes nitpicking at the end of a meal or on holiday. Apps can take that conversation awayTalia LoderickHowever, a link-upa year ago between the app and the payment services platform Tink enables UK Splitwise users to make direct payments to friends and family from within the Splitwise app.To use this, you need to link your bank account with Splitwise.The app is free to use, but also offers a premium service with extra features called Splitwise Pro, which is £3.99 a month or £39.99 a year.Splid is another free-to-use appavailable for UK users. It doesn’t require you to register for an account. The app lets you choose from more than 150 local currencies and works offline, too, which means it could be especially useful if you are travelling as a group of friends in places where there is limited internet access.Another free app to help keep track of and settle shared expenses istricount, which is owned by the European financial firm Bunq, and boasts it has “millions of users worldwide”.These sorts of apps can really come into their own in terms of taking away some of the awkwardness associated with splitting costs fairly and settling up, says Loderick.She adds: “No one likes the nitpicking at the end of a meal or on holiday. The apps can take that conversation away.”Allingham says apps such as Splitwise can be particularly effective for splitting small expenses between friends, such as grabbing a coffee.See what your bank offersView image in fullscreenSome banks offer bill-splitting services.Photograph: Chris Ratcliffe/REX ShutterstockNatWest used to offer a well-regarded bill-splitting app called Housemate that was designed to “take the stress out of renting” by splitting bills and keeping track of shared expenses. Unfortunately, Housemate is now no more –it was shut down in Februarythis year.However, several other banks have similar tools.The app-based bank Monzo has a feature called Split which it says “lets you split, track and chase payments, all in one safe place”. It enables people to keep track of joint expenses such as household bills, and also allows them to split one-off payments such as a dinner. An individual can be added to a Split even if they do not bank with Monzo (they need to be invited by a customer though).Starling Bank offers an in-app feature called Split the Bill, which it says lets you work out who owes what and send out “IOUs” in just a few taps. Recipients of the IOUs will be taken to a secure webpage to pay you back – or they can do it directly from the app if they also bank with Starling.The UK digital bank Kroo is another that offers bill splitting. You can set up a group in the app and add your collective spending. Anyone can be part of a group, and you can send a non-Kroo customer a payment link, but if they are not an account holder, they won’t be notified they have joined a group, and they won’t be able to see the group details.Revolut also lets customers split bills with other users.Explore more on these topicsFintechMoney hacksFriendshipHousehold billsRestaurantsAppsBanks and building societiesStudentsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some of the things he buys are fake designer items, which he markets as genuine. But some are perfectly legal: collectible action figures and the like which are advertised entirely honestly. At the beginning we see him ruthlessly buying “therapy devices” from a medical business that has gone bust and then exploitatively putting them up for sale. (But wait. Even if we believe in these therapy devices, why doesn’t the embattled business itself just sell them online? It’s not explained.)Flush with cash, Ryôsuke moves to a place in the country to pursue his business with more space for his dodgy goods and his girlfriend moves there with him. But then the people he’s defrauded band together in some kind of unlikely enraged gang to get payback, all of them apparently with casual access to weaponry. Ryôsuke’s own assistant turns out to be pretty much gun crazy.And so all the hi-tech detail and low-key everyday believability of the story is jettisoned in favour of an entirely ridiculous shootout in a deserted factory, with many deafening bullet ricochets off metal fittings. The final half-hour seems to be a neo-western style melee which seems to go on for ever. Odd … and unrewarding.Cloud is in UK cinemas from 25 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersDrama filmsCrime filmsInternetJapanAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

Climate change, pandemics and novel risks are coming for all of us – whether we bury our heads in the sand or not – and government data is critical to our understanding of the risks these challenges bring and how to address them.Much of this data remainsout of sightto those who don’t use it, even though they benefit us all. Over the past few months, theTrump administrationhas brazenly attacked our scientific establishment throughagency firings,censorshipandfunding cuts, and it has explicitly targeteddatathe American taxpayers have paid for. They’re stealing from us and putting our health and wellbeing in danger – so now we must advocate for these federal resources.Fifteen years after Deepwater Horizon, Trump is setting the stage for disaster |  Terry GarciaRead moreThat’s why we at thePublic Environmental Data Partnersare working to preserve critical environmental data. We are a coalition of non-profits, academic institutions, researchers and volunteers who work with federal data to support policy, research, advocacy and litigation work. We are one node in an expansive web of organizations fighting for the data American taxpayers have funded and that benefits us all. The first phase of our work has been to identify environmental justice tools and datasets at risk through conversations with environmental justice groups, current and former employees in local, state, and federal climate and environment offices, and researchers. To date, we have saved over a hundred priority datasets and have reproduced six tools.We’re not fighting for data for data’s sake; we’re fighting for data because it helps us make sense of the world.The utility of many of these datasets and tools comes from the fact that they are routinely updated. While our efforts ensure that we have snapshots of these critical data sources and tools, it will be a huge loss if these cease to be updated entirely. That’s why we are “life rafting” tools outside of government – standing up copies of them on publicly accessible, non-government pages – hoping that we can return them to a future administration that cares about human and environmental health and does not view science as a threat.The second phase is to develop these tools, advocate for better data infrastructure, and increase public engagement. There’s a question of scope – if the government stops sharing National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration data, we don’t have the resources to start monitoring and tracking hurricanes. For many of these critical data sources, the government is the only entity with the resources to collect and publish this data – think about thethousands of weather stationsset up around the world or theglobal air pollution monitorsor thesprayofsatellitesorbiting the earth. On the other hand, we do have the expertise to build environmental justice tools that better serve the communities that have borne the brunt of environmental injustice, by co-creating with those communities and by building from what we have saved from the government – like the Council on Environmental Quality’sCEJST, the Environmental Protection Agency’sEJScreen, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’sSocial Vulnerability and Environmental Justicetools.The Nobel is just the start: 16 imagined victories for Donald Trump | Ariel DorfmanRead moreA common refrain of the saboteurs is that if these functions that they are targeting are important enough, the states or the private sector will step in to fill the gap. While some of these functions of the federal government are replicable outside of government, privatization will render them less accessible, more expensive and subject to the whims of the markets. The states can also step in and fill some gaps – but many of the biggest challenges that we’re facing are best tackled by a strong federal government. Furthermore, many states arehappily joining this anti-science crusade. The climate crisis and pandemics don’t stop politely at state borders. If data collection is left up to the states, the next pandemic will not leave a state untouched because it dismantled its public health department – but such actions will leave a gaping hole in our understanding of the risks to the residents of that state and its neighbors. What’s more, some states do not have the resources to stand up the infrastructure required to shoulder the burden of data collection. Coordination between federal and state governments is essential.Data is being stolen from us; our ability to understand the world is being stolen from us. Americans will die because theTrump administrationis abdicating its responsibility to the people – this censorship regime will have dire consequences. That’s why we must stand up for science, we must be loud about the importance of federal data and we must put the brakes on Trump’s un-American agenda.Jonathan Gilmour is a data scientist at Harvard’s TH Chan School of PublicHealth, a fellow at the Aspen Policy Academy, and coordinator at the Public Environmental Data Partners.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionTrump administrationUS politicsInfectious diseasesHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

But politics is not funny any moreMon 21 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Apr 2025 12.45 EDTShareThe classic television gameshow is one of the simplest pleasures available to the sedentary, socially maladjusted people we used to call “couch potatoes”. An average Joe is required to perform a task – ranging from answering a trivia question or spinning a large, colorful wheel tokeeping a hand on a Toyota Land Cruiserfor as long as possible – in exchange for the possibility of winning a cash prize (ora truck). For the viewer, there is the satisfaction of believing, perhaps falsely, that you could win the prize if you were in the contestant’s place. Maybe you identify with that contestant and actively root for their success. Or perhaps you just want to see some poor bastardshot out of a cannon, like on TBS’s dearly departed series Wipeout. Whatever your pleasure might be, it’s not an uncommon or esoteric one.Why do Trump voters have no regrets? Because the people they hate are getting hurt more | Arwa MahdawiRead moreWe watch gameshows because they are basic human drama distilled into an easily repeatable format. TV development executives have tried to modernize it with the fancy graphics of something like NBC’sThe Wallor the gratuitous flesh-baring of the 2000s disasterpiece Are You Hot, in which a panel of “celebrity” judges such as Lorenzo Lamas critiqued people on the number of visible abs on their bodies. The simpler a gameshow premise –guessing the costof basic household items,answering multiple choice questionsin a spooky room, ordoing menial tasksfor a man who combs his hair forward – the better. Perhaps this is why my initial reaction to thepress releasefor the forthcoming mini-seriesGreg Gutfeld’s What Did I Miss?, on the Fox Nation streaming service, was so immediately negative.In the new series, Gutfeld (who made an entire career out of sporting a perpetually self-satisfied smirk that turns liberals into feral animals running around in circles and urinating on the floor) quizzes contestants on the headlines. The unusual part: these contestants have been sequestered in upstate New York for three months, “with no contact to the outside world – no phones, internet, television, or social media” – not unlike the short-livedBBC series The Bubble. Some of the headlines Gutfeld offers are real. Some are fabricated. It is up to the sad group of media-starved test subjects to ferret out what’s real from what isn’t.Imagine, a blissful 90 days of not knowing what is happening outside your window. A three-month vacation of regular meals, uninterrupted sleep and zero temptation to spend hours scrolling TikTok for videos ofpeople marinating chicken in NyQuil. Doesn’t that sound lovely? Jared Letospent 12 days in blissful meditative isolationat the start of the Covid pandemic and when he came back into civilization, someone had to tell him he couldn’t eat inside at Nobu any more. I feel bad for the guy, but he probably reminisces about those 12 days constantly.The blessed contestants of What Did I Miss? were afforded not just 12 days of peace, but 90 of them. That’s almost eight times what Jared Leto got! And on the other side, there’s the chance to win $50,000. Hopefully the inflation rate doesn’t spike again and that money keeps its value. They’re gonna need it when they hear about those tariffs.I suppose What Did I Miss? is more of a stunt than a traditional gameshow premise. Something closer toJoe Millionaire, a dating show where women vie for the attention of a man they think is rich but is actually not. How many times can you do something like that before the novelty wears off? You can only sequester so many people for three months before it starts to feel even cheaper than it is.Of course, beyond the show being crass, it trivializes everything in our current moment of social upheaval and angst. “Isn’t that Donald Trump a wacky guy? He’s so wild, you’ll never guess the nutso stuff he got up to last week!” Being that this is a Fox Nation production starring Fox News’s favorite bobblehead doll, it stands to reason that the audience for the show is people who still find something funny about news headlines. We are far beyond the days when someone could riff for hours on the image ofGeorge HW Bush puking on the prime minister of Japan. That was, in fact, quite amusing. I mean, man, just look at him hurl! That’s something else, isn’t it, folks?Donald Trumphas yet to vomit on a world leader, but we can certainly say he has soiled the basic functions of democracy. This is not speculating on what your crazy uncle got up to after he raided the liquor cabinet. Are these contestants expected to suss out the fake headline from choices like “sent an innocent man to asupermax prisonthat looks like it was ripped off fromJudge Dredd comics” or “threatened to tank the world economy just to see what would happen”? Call me a stick-in-the-mud if you like, but I’m just not seeing the breezy joy of the standard gameshow in a series in which people must guess whose human rights have been denied and why.Trump is creating a selfish, miserable world. Here’s what we can do | Michael PlantRead moreTheFoxNation president, Lauren Petterson, said in the press release: “Truth can be stranger than fiction and who better to help isolated Americans catch up on the headlines they missed during an unprecedented news cycle than Greg Gutfeld.” The word I’m thinking of for all of this is not “strange”. “Grim”? Yes. “Dispiriting”? Sure. “Morally reprehensible”? Bingo.Instead of calling what we are witnessing a series of preventable calamities, we refer to it as a “news cycle”. Life is reduced to the whims of the media machine. It is, itself, a gameshow played for big money, where the object is to do or say the worst thing possible so people pay attention to you. That seems like the aim of the entire endeavor – to use cheeky TV smarm to make all of this palatable. It flattens that which we should be outraged about into a sickly sweet pancake of gameshow pablum. I hope the winner of this farce refuses the money in exchange for being sent back to the little house in upstate New York, free of the knowledge that human suffering is now government policy.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionTrump administrationFoxTelevisionDonald TrumpGame showscommentShareReuse this content"

Like seasoned illusionists, they use chaos abroad to obscure injustice at home, to legitimise morally indefensible immigration policies.It is as though the UK and the US exchanged a sly nod across the Atlantic, and said: “Let’s see just how far we can go.”If you are the wrong colour and hail from a former colony, you’re not welcome – unless you’re bringing money or mineralsThe US is now overseeing the deportation of thousands. Not illegal migrants. Legal. Some have lived in the country for decades, built families, contributed to society, paid taxes. As detention centre doors slam, dreams are extinguished in real time.Caribbean nations’ citizenship-by-investment (CBI) programmes, including Antigua & Barbuda, Dominica, Saint Kitts & Nevis, and Saint Lucia,are now under investigation by the US due to perceived security concerns, potentiallyfacing travel restrictions. So, too, Africans arefacing bansandvisa cancellations.Not to be outdone, the UK has begun tightening visa restrictions on African andCaribbean nationsunder the thinnest of pretences. To us, the message is clear: if you are the wrong colour and hail from a former colony, you’re not welcome. Of course, you’re more than welcome if you are Ukrainian or bringing money or minerals.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump throws pens used to sign executive orders to the crowd at his inauguration. He dismissed the Bishop of Washington’s appeal for greater compassion.Photograph: Matt Rourke/APA report on theroots of the Windrush scandalposted on the UK government’s website summarises, “major immigration legislation in 1962, 1968 and 1971 was designed to reduce the proportion of people living in the United Kingdom who did not have white skin.” Sixty years later, the UK still engages this socio-political ideology.Take the absurd treatment ofTrinidad and Tobago. British authorities, in a fit of performative panic, last month slapped exorbitant visa fees on Trinidadians, similar to Jamaica and Dominica. The justification? A spike in asylum claims – from an average of 49 a year between 2015 and 2019 to 439 in 2023.In the year ending June 2024, the UK’s net immigration was 728,000, a 20% decrease from 2023’s peak of 906,000. Yet 439 Trinidadians cause a “crisis”? This is political theatre staged for a frothing few with empire nostalgia and immigrant paranoia.The Commonwealth is an expensive, hollow monument to a colonial past Britain refuses to apologise for and the Caribbean refuses to walk away fromBut the Trinbagonian government cannot be let off the hook. For over a decade,gang violencetriggered by smuggled guns from the US, the drug trade from South America, the US and UK, and the influx of gang members from Venezuela has worsened under an impuissant minister of security anda government in paralysis.This new UK immigration policy for Trinidad and Tobago isn’t policy, its punishment. It’s the empire rearing its head again – this time in the guise of “immigration control”. If the UK was truly concerned, it could have picked up the phone and spoken to the high commissioner to the UK or even the Prime Minister to find a proportionate solution – as fellowCommonwealthmembers.But what does the Commonwealth even mean any more? A glorified nostalgia club presided over by a monarch few in the Caribbean have ever seen.The Commonwealth is a relic. An expensive, hollow monument to a colonial pastBritain refuses to apologise forand the Caribbean refuses to walk away from. Common means subservience, and wealth flows only one way. For example, the judicial committee of the privy council remains the highest court for many Caribbean nations – a colonial backdoor that ensures British influence remains after the union jack has been lowered.View image in fullscreenA protest calling for slavery reparations at the British high commission in Kingston during the visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales to Jamaica in 2022.Photograph: Ricardo Makyn/AFP/GettyWhy does theCaribbeanstill genuflect before a throne that sees it as a holiday destination at best and an aid burden at worst? Why do African nations tolerate the condescension of aid when their stolen minerals fuel the west’s riches? As Bob Marley demanded, we must “emancipate ourselves from mental slavery”?The truth is: the west cannot function without us. It feeds off our resources, our oil and minerals, our intellect. Yet it treats us like pests at the door: unworthy of entry, let alone equality.Why are we still playing this rigged game? Why are we still begging for visas, pleading for asylum, when our presence build these nations in the first place?It’s time we stopped asking for permission, withdrew our labour, our brilliance, ourselves – and leave them to stew in their nostalgia. Let them keep their kingdoms, mistaking walls for strength and xenophobia for sovereignty. We’ll build something better.Cuban doctors have long been a symbol of solidarity, from a nation routinely vilified – nothing terrifies Washington more than socialism in brown skinTrump’s sledgehammer approach to diplomacy has torched relationships with Canada, Panama, Greenland, SouthAfricaand the broader African continent. The Caribbean is not spared, least of all that US favourite: Cuba.This time, he unleashed his bulldog secretary of state, Marco Rubio,on Cuba’s quiet but powerful diplomatic engine:its doctors. For decades,Cuban medical professionals have travelled the world, from rural outposts in Africa to hurricane-ravaged villages in Haiti, treating the sick and delivering babies, with the soft diplomacy the US abandoned around the time it thought regime change was a sustainable foreign policy model.Cuban doctors have long symbolised international solidarity, emerging from a nation routinely vilified – because nothing terrifies Washington more than socialism in brown skin. But rather than acknowledge this medical diplomacy for what it is – a humanitarian gift – Rubio has instead accused Caribbean nations of exploiting these doctors, underpaying them and “trafficking” them. The audacity is breathtaking.Rubio threatened to revoke US visas from government officials and their immediate family members in any Caribbean country that accepts Cuban medical workers. Because America now exports moral lectures it no longer even pretends to live by.But this time, the Caribbean didn’t flinch. Leaders across the region responded with collective eye-rolling and a resounding: “Come take your visa.”Handouts are never free. The cruel US aid freeze is an opportunity for the Caribbean | Kenneth MohammedRead moreThese are independent nations, not colonial subsidiaries of the US. Caribbean leaders made it clear: Cuban doctors are paid on a par with local medical professionals, they are not coerced, and are free to leave at any time. They are crucial to the region’s healthcare systems.Rubio’s daring to speak on behalf of doctors who have done more good across the global south than the aid-slashing US state department has in decades, is an insult not just to the Caribbean but to common sense.What we are witnessing here is a petulance from a fading empire that has replaced its moral compass with paranoia, and outsourced its diplomacy to the whisperings of a ketamine-fuelled billionaire, delusional oligarchs and baby-faced thinktanks addicted to colonial cosplayAmerica’s diplomacy has died, been cremated and scattered over Mar-a-Lago.So while Washington plays imperial hardball with nations trying to provide healthcare to their citizens, the rest of us are left wondering, again, why we allow ourselves to be bullied by a country thatcannot keep its own citizens out of medical bankruptcy.At some point, the Caribbean – and the wider global south – must draw a red line. Not just rhetorically, but structurally. We need new alliances, new trading currencies, new friends, new models of cooperation rooted not in colonial debt but mutual respect.Because it is increasingly clear that the US is not interested in partnerships – it wants puppets.

Here is what European leaders must doPaul TaylorThe EU, the world’s biggest single market, can reposition itself and become less reliant on exporting goods to the US and ChinaMon 21 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Apr 2025 09.47 EDTShareThis is whyAmerica firstdoesn’t have to mean Europe last.Europeans have had plenty to mope about since Donald Trump entered the White House not quite three months ago. The US president has said that the EU was created to “screw the United States” and slapped punitive tariffs on European goods. He has cast doubt on the US commitment to defend Nato allies. He has cosied up to Vladimir Putin, insulted Volodymyr Zelenskyy and tried to settle Russia’s war in Ukraine on terms that would undermine European security. His vice-president has denigrated European democratic values, and his national security team has spewed venom in a Signal chat at“pathetic” Europe.Yet the dark Trumpian clouds have a silver lining if we Europeans play our cards right. The advent of an illiberal, authoritarian nationalist regime in our closest ally may yet be a blessing in disguise if it helps European leaders tear down longstanding self-imposed obstacles to integration. Just think of the multiple opportunities to make Europe great again:Finally complete the European capital markets union and banking union to unleash the cross-border investment power of some €3tn in European savingsStrike trade deals with countries and regions around the world, seeking a reliable partner committed to cutting tariffs rather than weaponising themJointly develop common defence capabilities to strengthen the European wing of Nato and be able to defend European interests if the US withdraws or steps asideProvide Ukraine with greater military assistance, including medium-range missiles to fill the US gap and strengthen its position before any negotiationBuild international coalitions to defend liberal democracy, and uphold a rules-based order with like-minded partners from Canada to Japan, India and AustraliaExpand economic partnerships with middle- and low-income countries in Asia, Africa and South America that consider the EU a more reliable partner than a protectionistUS or a predatory Russia, and a valuable hedge against excessive dependence onChinaOffer a special visa programme to attract US scientists and tech workers fleeing Trump’s university crackdownMoreover, we can do all this without forfeiting a transatlantic economic partnership that remains the world’s biggest business relationship, withtwo-way investment north of $5tn in 2023. The EU remains the biggest single market in the world, with about 448 million consumers and an attractive business location for companies seeking political stability, the rule of law and a skilled workforce. That’s whyUS investment continues to pour into Francedespite high tax levels and regulation.On trade, the EU has rightly held back from kneejerk retaliation for each haphazard announcement from the White House while making clear its willingness to use all its powers, including potentially against US tech giants, if Trump does not accept an equitable solution. The jury is still out on prospects of a negotiated settlement, but the EU must work in the medium term to make its economy less reliant on exports to the US and China.Trump’s arbitrarily calculated tariffs and slashing of development and humanitarian assistance, as well as ending US support for democracy and human rights promotion around the world, have increased demand for European engagement – not just to plug the gaps left by the sudden cutoff of US aid but also to build sustained relationships. Sadly, some big European countries are alsoreducing their aid budgetsto pay for extra defence spending.Apart from the jolt from Trump’s hostile actions, there’s another reason to believe the EU may finally achieve some of the critical advances that have proved elusive in the last decade: leadership. Germany is under new management, and its incoming chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has demonstrated he’swilling to throw outdecades of balanced-budget dogma to revive a stagnant economy, build a more robust defence and repair his country’s broken infrastructure.Donald Trump is now badly wounded. Europe can seize an advantage | Will HuttonRead moreThe centre-right Merz, who will lead acentrist coalitionbetween his Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats, hasdeclared his ambitionto revive German leadership in the EU, in partnership with French president Emmanuel Macron and Polish prime minister Donald Tusk. He also wants to draw the UK into a closer security and defence embrace with the EU and work with Keir Starmer, both to build a stronger rampart against Putin’s aggression and in the hope of a longer-term economic rapprochement to overcome the damage of Brexit.Historically, European integration tends to accelerate during crises and slacken when the pressure is off. The EU now faces twin existential challenges from a ruthless, revisionist Putin and a vandalistic, unpredictable Trump. Add to that a third, internal challenge from nationalist populism that could tear the union apart if the current generation of leaders doesn’t give Europe a fundamental new impulse.If pro-Putin populists in Hungary and Slovakia block the use of EU institutions to achieve these objectives, then governments should create coalitions of willing states to take the necessary decisions, supported by the European Commission wherever possible.European leaders must invest their political capital together decisively now to turn the Trump disaster into an opportunity for Europe.Paul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy CentreExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionEuropean UnionTrump tariffscommentShareReuse this content"

He understood the church had become too doctrinaire, divisive and judgmental for too many people. The drift of Catholics from conventional practice in the west said as much. He knew the church had alienated the LGBTQ community, discriminated against women and resisted full participation for divorced and remarried Catholics. He acknowledged that previous popes had not confronted the clerical sex abuse scandal.He wanted to do betterand the Catholic world was with him, the institution was not.The Catholic church by its nature is a conservative institution. It uses inertia as a management tool. Change is a slow and drawn-out affair. Francis regularly railed against clericalism because of its sense of entitlement and misuse of power. He saw it as one of the reasons why the church became obsessed with protecting its image instead of believing and caring for the victims of clerical sex abuse. He also realised the clerical instinct to protect their own and conceal their crimes was underpinned by their exclusive hold on the workings of the church.The Guardian view on Pope Francis: an outsider who was a force for good in the world | EditorialRead moreHe became determined to recalibrate the relationship between clerics and ordinary Catholics for there to be more mutuality and collaboration in church governance and decision-making. This did not win him friends within the church bureaucracy.To his credit Francis embarked on a personal conversion in his attitude and approach to the handling of the sex abuse scandal. As with his predecessors he shared their instinct to protect the image of the church before the welfare of victims. At times he also blamed the media for unjustified attacks on the church.Early in his papacy he took too long to believe the testimony of some victims and appeared to side with their abusers and the bishops who concealed the crimes. Butonce the scales fell from his eyeshe became resolute to impose a new regime of transparency and accountability. He famously summoned all theChilean bishops to Rome, dismissing many of them due to their mishandling of abuse cases in that country. He established a papal commission to advise on procedural reforms in the handling of sex abuse cases. He insisted the church adopt a “zero tolerance” culture in managing instances of the abuse of children by priests. He has tried to impose rigorous standards for the safeguarding of children and vulnerable people.His legacy in confronting the abuse scandal is still incomplete. TheVaticanbureaucracy slowed the pace of reform. It placed many canonical hurdles in its path. The church administration, even in Australia, still uses legal conventions to ward off the prospect of financial reparation payouts instead of taking moral stances to properly compensate its victims. Too many people still struggle against the might of the church to get justice.Francis was a refreshingly open and pastoral pope. He pushed the church to reach out to the marginalised. He said bridges needed to be built, but also walked across. He consistently reminded the church that inclusion was essential and respecting diversity was integral to the nature ofChristianity. He demonstrated through his own life that change is possible and mercy can be real. He has lit the path for us all.Francis Sullivan AO is the chair of Concerned Catholics Canberra Goulburn and the former CEO of the Catholic church’s Truth, Justice and Healing CouncilExplore more on these topicsPope FrancisOpinionCatholicismChristianityThe papacyReligionVaticancommentShareReuse this content"

So it is that, after four decades of remaining steadfastly opposed to competitive sport, I now spend early mornings, late afternoons, occasional evenings and every weekend driving my children to an ever-expanding range of sporting activities.The sharpest twist of the irony blade is that, having spent my own childhood as the player no wise coach would want on his team, I am now the coach of four separate floorball teams. (Yes, I know you haven’t heard of floorball,look it up.) To coach one team may be regarded as an accident; four looks like a weird addiction. But here I am.Coaching competitive kids sport often feels like a pure and highly concentrated form of parenting. If parenthood spells out your failings as a human being across several decades, coaching tends to do so in half hour bursts, with a running scorecard. Many of the parenting decisions you make under pressure will be wrong, but rarely can they be so well quantified.As with parenting, coaching has brought me into close and uncomfortable contact with aspects of my own character that had been hitherto concealed. In my pre-sporting life, I prided myself on being rational and easygoing. Unfussed and unruffled. It turns out that this calm exterior was a front – I am instead ruthlessly competitive, capable of resisting the doe-eyed and pleading stare of a benched player (or parent) for the sake of the team. I just feel terrible about it afterwards.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsIf coaching is sometimes fraught – some of the most poisonous WhatsApp messages I’ve seen have been connected to kids’ sport – that’s because sport brings into sharp focus our conflicted ideas about what childhood is for. Is it a space for fun and creativity, or a time to learn how to chase goals and compete with your peers?Outside coaching, I’m very much in the former camp. Kids should run free and wild. There will be time for work and worry later. But I can also (despite a lifetime of resisting this lesson) see the value in helping kids work as a team towards a common goal, which in turn means helping them identify and hone skills that might not immediately be obvious to them or anyone else.So much of parenting is helping your kids find the path that means something to them. (And then forcing them out of the house every Saturday morning to do something they will love.) As a parent, it can be hard to detach your hopes and expectations for your children from the dreams they actually want to pursue. Coaching has brought this home to me. To lift kids up, you need to be willing to see the strengths they have, not the ones you need, expect or desire. Give kids the chance to prove you wrong.Sometimes this means direction and sometimes it means giving them the space to prove themselves – and discover those skills for themselves. Our eldest, when younger, seemed to have inherited my non-sporting genes, but another (better) coach helped her discover a hidden gift for goalkeeping. Last week she tried out for her first international tournament. There is room for everyone on the court and not every position is for every player.I’ve also come to realise that tough love is overrated.As I’ve come to terms with my unexpected competitiveness, I’ve also come to realise that tough love is overrated. A training session shouldn’t be a bootcamp. I’m not immune to the parental urge to prepare your children for a tough and uncaring world, but I now try to prepare them for trials without freaking them out.One of our teams consistently lost in semi-finals and I came to realise we were losing because, well, they were the semi-finals, with all the stress that brings. Stressed kids don’t play well.Instead of getting them worked up for a tough game, I now spend the 10 minutes before the game reassuring them. They know what to do. They have worked hard. They’ve got this. The astonished look on that team’s faces at the end of this season’s semi as they realised they had beaten a previously unbeatable team was priceless. It turns out sport can be funandcompetitive.My son has found a way to beat me at chess – replace all the pieces with Minecraft Lego | Séamas O’ReillyRead moreI came into coaching – and parenthood – thinking it was all about tactics and strategies. Making tough choices and keeping an eye on the big picture. This is true. But it is also – of course – about basic psychology. Not simply directing kids but helping them discover parts of themselves that might otherwise remain hidden. Helping them build meaningful and productive relationships with each other and with themselves.Unfortunately, while coaching might be good for the kids’ mental health, that doesn’t always translate to the parents. I am so well-trained in worrying about my own kids that it has been all too easy to start worrying about entire teams of them. It embarrasses me to admit that I have had sleepless nights before big matches and plenty more after bad matches, wondering what I could have done better.Which brings me to the biggest lesson. Those are not my matches. Those are not my games. When we invest in our children, whether as coaches or parents, we often expect a dividend. All too often, we can see our children as a means to correct the mistakes we have made or the wrongs we have suffered. But it’s not about us.The most important – and unjust – double standard for parents and coaches alike is that, while our children’s failures are often our fault, their triumphs never are. While we can enable, our children’s victories should always belong to them alone.Myke Bartlett is a writer and criticExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionChildrenFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

In a letter sent to the country’s Roman Catholic bishops, he made clear that he completely disagreed with Trump’s mass deportation plans for illegal migrants. “What is built on the basis of force, and not on the truth about the equal dignity of every human being, begins badly and will end badly.”The sentiment was not only reserved for Trump. Throughout his 12 years as pope, Francis, whodied this morning at the age of 88, focused on the dignity of people, especially those viewed by others as outsiders – whether migrants, prisoners, whom he often visited, or LGBTQ+ people. “Who am I to judge?” he famously said when asked about his attitude towards gay men and women, a remark that contrasted starkly with his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, who once described homosexuality as a tendency “ordered towards an intrinsic moral evil”.This focus on outsiders stemmed in part from Francis’s own experience. He grew up in Argentina, about 7,000 miles from theVatican, and was the child of migrants, whose family arrived in Buenos Aires in 1929, seeking a new start after scraping a living in rural Italy. It was this that caused him to joke to the crowds in Rome’s St Peter’s Square, on the night of his election in March 2013, that the cardinals had gone to the peripheries to find a new pope.While these experiences shaped Francis’s thinking, so did the gospels. He became one of the great communicators of Christian faith, chattily expounding like a parish priest to pilgrims attending his general audiences in St Peter’s Square. He would finish reciting the Angelus prayer there on Sundays with a “buon pranzo” – have a good lunch – and rarely wore traditional red shoes or white trousers, complaining they made him look like an ice-cream seller. He abandoned the apostolic palace for a simple room in the Casa Santa Marta, a residence used by bishops and cardinals visiting Rome.This style forms a major part of his legacy. Francis was a pope who wanted none of the pomp of a papacy. But there was substance underlying this, too. His concern for those most affected by economic hardship, war and politics, and the tide of refugees sweeping through Europe and America, was matched by his empathy for those uprooted by the climate crisis. His concern for the planet – what he called “our common home” – was rooted in a reverence for God’s creation. His most radical encyclical, or teaching document, Laudato si’, was published in 2015, putting forward scientific and theological reasons for protecting the planet from climate breakdown. He would often give his visitors a copy – including Trump, in 2017.View image in fullscreenA newly elected Pope Francis during Sunday Angelus prayer at the Vatican, 17 March 2013.Photograph: Tony Gentile/ReutersDespite his focus on justice, ecology and poverty, there were dissatisfied rumblings about his papacy inside the church. When the cardinals gathered in Rome to vote for the successor to Benedict XVI after his sudden resignation in February 2013, they wanted a reformer who could shake up the management of the church’s finances. Francis swept away the old guard of cardinal overseers, and set up his own team of clerics and lay experts, after revelations of mismanagement of the Vatican’s own finances emerged.He also attempted to change the way the church dealt with priests involved in child sexual abuse. His changes began well, but floundered as details emerged of clerics to whom Francis himself seemed to have been too lenient. Some of those who supported the Argentinian felt frustrated that the church moved too slowly.Conservatives in the church were most outraged by Francis’s approach to morality, particularly his decision to urge parish priests to decide on individual cases as to whether divorced Catholics who remarried should receive communion. After this, his fiercest opponents published an unprecedented document – adubia,or expression of doubt, about his teaching. They showed similar disdain for his more recent proposal, published in 2023, that outlined the possibility of blessings for same-sex couples.But liberals were frustrated, too, particularly by his refusal to countenance women becoming priests. True, he appointed several women, albeit almost entirely nuns, to key Vatican positions that were previously always occupied by men. That marked huge change, as did his recent synods, which gave lay participants at the synod gatherings – the representatives of ordinary Catholics in the pews – equal discussion and voting rights with bishops and cardinals.Now, as the door to the pope’s room is ritually sealed, and his personal papal ring he has worn for the past 12 years is snapped in two, there will be speculation as to who will follow him. Francis will have played his part in shaping the church in his image. Of the 138 cardinals eligible to vote in the next conclave to elect a new pope, 110 are Francis’s personal picks.Whoever is elected next, and whatever version ofCatholicismthey preach, the church needs someone who understands how to use the contemporary media to reach out to the world, whether on social media, in a televised interview, or through a letter critiquing the US president. Whatever else a pope has to be today, he must be a great communicator. And if the pope has that gift, then he can be not only shepherd of the world’s Catholics, but someone who speaks to people of all faiths and none. There were times when Francis did appear to have that talent.As to the Catholic church itself, given the divisions that constantly threaten to overwhelm it, living up to the old papal title of pontifex – bridge – is an almost impossible task.Catherine Pepinster is a former editor of The Tablet, the Catholic journalDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But so has online radicalisation – and we can’t ignore thatMon 21 Apr 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Apr 2025 05.14 EDTShareFor decades, there has been a cultural narrative that the church is a declining institution, which has been backed up by data that shows fewer and fewer British people are attending services. You might expect churches to be busy over festivals like this past Easter weekend, or Christmas, but with otherwise sparse crowds and aging parishioners for the rest of the year.However, a recent survey entitledThe Quiet Revival, commissioned by the Bible Society and conducted by YouGov, shows that church attendance in England and Wales has actually increased by 50% over the past six years, and that young people aged between 18 and 24 are the second largest demographic in attendance (behind those who are 65 and over). The trend is especially strong with young men, with 21% aged 18 to 24 saying they attend church at least once a month, compared with 12% of young women. The data also shows that generation Z are particularly drawn to Roman Catholicism, which accounts for a significant rise in the number of Catholics in England, almost closing the overall gap between those who identify as Catholic and those who identify as Anglican.England and Wales are not alone in seeing more young men attending church, with the New York Times religion correspondent,Ruth Graham, reporting that the same trend can be seen across the US. Graham is blunt in her proposed reason for this, stating that men are less educated than their female peers, while also placing a higher value on traditional family structures, meaning that they find encouragement and reinforcement in conservative church communities.This is a somewhat unsympathetic reading of the circumstances, but when attempting to locate the possible influences on these young men, the landscape does look bleak. Thanks to the recentNetflix show Adolescence, there has been much public reckoning with the radicalisation of young boys and men through online spaces and podcasts that are overtly misogynistic – and plenty of these masquerade as platforms of Christian, specifically Catholic, values. The Instagram page warrior.4.christ acts as a Catholic “meme page”, with openly homophobic, antisemitic and culturally conservative content, posting quotes about anti-abortion movements and generally being against “liberalism”. There is very little interaction with actual biblical scripture or Catholic practice, beyond using a vaguely defined idea of it to justify a celebration of rightwing ideas and talking points.Tristan Tate, brother of the infamous male lifestyle influencer Andrew Tate, has also been vocal about his conversion to Christianity. The Tate brothers reside in Romania (where they arefacing charges of human trafficking, which they deny), and Tristan has spoken about the strong belief in God among Romanians that encouraged him to convert. He also identifies abortion as one of the topics that he now “takes seriously”. Tristan Tate and other influencers place emphasis on the real misogynistic or reactionary elements of some Christian movements, and make them part of their wider ecosystem of influence on young men and boys.View image in fullscreenA Micah food bank in Toxteth, Liverpool, based at St Vincent de Paul church.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe Bible Society’s report states that more research is needed to fully discern where a desire to join Christian faith communities has stemmed from. The murkier corners of the internet are very probably a factor, but I can’t help but remain cautiously optimistic about the findings. The report also highlights how a significant concern for all of the gen Z participants interviewed is social activism, with far more churchgoing interviewees recording that they do frequent community and charity work compared to those who are not church members. This work is recorded as donating to food banks, financial donations to charities, voting in elections, writing to local representatives and communal work such as litter picking. These are hopeful statistics that demonstrate a positive participation in society that is encouraged by churchgoing.What both of these possible influences highlight is an overriding wish for community, whether in the more rigid boundaries of the Catholic church, or in the collective work that English and Welsh churches of all denominations encourage and facilitate. An instinct towards a collective with a solid foundation is understandable in an age bracket that has had its education, whether in secondary school or university (or both), disrupted by a global pandemic. Where school or university should have provided a social outlet for young people alongside their education, necessity meant that they instead had isolated experiences.Truss social: the latest chapter from a woman who really knows what the people want | Zoe WilliamsRead moreOn top of this,years of austerity in England and Waleshas meant that community centres and public halls have drastically declined in numbers, with spending on libraries, theatres and museums falling. Young people looking for community may find that a local church or cathedral is the only place close to them with regular opening hours and people ready to talk and listen. That these same churches and cathedrals very often organise group charity work is a clear plus. In my own constituency area of Liverpool Riverside,Micah is the charitable armof Liverpool Cathedral and other churches, providing food and financial aid to local people in need, and it was a big reason for my own initial interest in joining the church.As a regular churchgoer, it would be lovely to celebrate the findings of The Quiet Revival and to leave it at that. However, the data is so unusual and unexpected that it invites analysis – and when digging for clues, not all of them are positive. What can be discerned is that more people are searching for meaning in an ever-changing and demonstrably politically unstable world, and they are finding this in multiple forms ofChristianity. This is good and should be celebrated – but as people who have a vested interest in our neighbours, we should also look out for signs of possible online radicalisation and tendencies towards hateful speech in the guise of Jesus’s influence.Jessica White is a writer based in LiverpoolDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In one, there are real pictures and footage of the world as it is: politics, sport, news and entertainment. In the other is AI slop, low-quality content with minimal human input. Some of it is banal and pointless – cartoonish images of celebrities, fantasy landscapes, anthropomorphised animals. And some is a sort of pornified display of women just simply … being, like a virtual girlfriend you cannot truly interact with. The range and scale of the content is staggering, and infiltrates everything from social media timelines to messages circulated onWhatsApp. The result is not just a blurring of reality, but a distortion of it.A new genre of AI slop is rightwing political fantasy. There are entireYouTube videosof made-up scenarios in which Trump officials prevail against liberal forces. The White House account on X jumped on a trend of creating images in Studio Ghibli style and posted animage of a Dominican woman in tearsas she is arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). AI political memefare has, in fact, gone global. Chinese AI videos mocking overweight US workers on assembly lines after the tariff announcementraised a questionfor, and response from, the White House spokesperson last week. The videos, she said, were made by those who “do not see the potential of the American worker”. And to prove how pervasive AI slop is, I had to triple-check that even that response was not itself quickly cobbled-together AI content fabricating another dunk on Trump’s enemies.The impulse behind this politicisation of AI is not new; it is simply an extension of traditional propaganda. What is new is how democratised and ubiquitous it has become, and how it involves no real people or the physical constraints of real life, therefore providing an infinite number of fictional scenarios.The fact that AI content is also spread through huge and ubiquitous chat channels such as WhatsApp means that there are no replies or comments to challenge its veracity. Whatever you receive is imbued with the authority and reliability of the person who has sent it. I am in a constant struggle with an otherwise online-savvy elderly relative who receives and believes a deluge of AI content on WhatsApp about Sudan’s war. The images and videos look real to her and are sent by people she trusts. Even absorbing that technology is capable of producing content with such verisimilitude is difficult. Combine this with the fact that the content chimes with her political desires and you have a degree of stickiness, even when some doubt is cast on the content. What is emerging, amid all the landfill ofgiant balls of cats, is the use of AI to create, idealise and sanitise political scenarios by rendering them in triumphant or nostalgic visual language.Prof Roland Meyer, a scholar of media and visual culture,notes one particular“recent wave of AI-generated images of white, blond families presented by neofascist online accounts as models of a desirable future”. He attributes this not just to the political moment, but to the fact that “generative AI is structurally conservative, even nostalgic”. Generative AI is trained on pre-existing data, which research has shown isinherently biasedagainst ethnic diversity, progressive gender roles and sexual orientations, therefore concentrating those norms in the output.0:54Donald Trump shares bizarre AI-generated video of 'Trump Gaza' – videoThe same can be seen in “trad wife” content, which summons not only beautiful supplicant homemakers, but an entire throwback world in which men can immerse themselves. X timelines are awash with a sort of clothed nonsexual pornography, as AI images of women described as comely, fertile and submissive glimmer on the screen. White supremacy, autocracy, and fetishisation of natural hierarchies in race and gender are packaged as nostalgia for an imagined past. AI is already being described asthe new aesthetic of fascism.But it isn’t always as coherent as that. Most of the time, AI slop is just content-farming chaos. Exaggerated or sensationalised online material boosts engagement, giving creators the chance to make money based on shares, comments and so on. Journalist Max Readfound that Facebook AI slop– the sloppiest of them all – is, “as far as Facebook is concerned”, not “junk”, but “precisely what the company wants: highly engaging content”. To social media giants, content is content; the cheaper it is, the less human labour it involves, the better. The outcome is an internet of robots, tickling human users into whatever feelings and passions keep them engaged.But whatever the intent of its creators, this torrent of AI content leads to the desensitisation and overwhelming of visual palates. The overall effect of being exposed to AI images all the time, from the nonsensical to the soothing to the ideological, is that everything begins to land in a different way. In the real world, US politicianspose outside prison cages of deportees. Students at US universities areambushedin the street and spirited away. People in Gazaburnalive. These pictures and videos join an infinite stream of others that violate physical and moral laws. The result is profound disorientation. You can’t believe your eyes, but also what can you believe if not your eyes? Everything starts to feel both too real and entirely unreal.I can’t delete WhatsApp’s new AI tool. But I’ll use it over my dead body | Polly HudsonRead moreCombine that with the necessary trivialisation and provocative brevity of the attention economy and you have a grand circus of excess. Even when content is deeply serious, it is presented as entertainment or, as an intermission, in a sort of visual elevator music. Horrified by Donald Trump and JD Vance’s attack on Zelenskyy? Well, here is anAI renderingof Vance as a giant baby. Feeling stressed and overwhelmed? Here is some eye balm – acabin with a roaring fire and snow falling outside. Facebook has for some reason decided I need to see a constant stream of compact, cutesystudio apartmentswith a variation of “this is all I need” captions.And the rapid mutation of the algorithm then feeds users more and more of what it has harvested and deemed interesting to them. The result is that all media consumption, even for the most discerning users, becomes impossible to curate. You are immersed deeper and deeper into subjective worlds rather than objective reality. The result is a very weird disjuncture. The sense of urgency and action that our crisis-torn world should inspire is instead blunted by how information is presented. Here, there is a new way of sleepwalking into disaster. Not through lack of knowledge, but through the paralysis caused by every event being filtered through this perverse ecosystem – just another part of the maximalist visual and memetic show.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionSocial mediaWhatsAppXFacebookYouTubecommentShareReuse this content"

I was so busy for so long, with so many contracts overlapping each other, that I often didn’t have much time for anything else. By August 2023, I was burnt out.For the first time in years, I didn’t have any work lined up. I thought I’d take a month to catch up on lots of things I’d put aside amid the demands of deadlines: decluttering, writing, taking some time to reset.I thought it might be a good time to refresh my job application skills, zhoosh up my resume and see what was out there.I registered on all the usual jobs sites and upgraded my LinkedIn account, started updating my resume and website and started sending out applications. I was realistic: I didn’t think every application would be considered, and I knew it was a numbers game.After about six weeks, in which I’d submitted about a couple of applications a week with no response at all, I started to worry. For many, the silly season starts after the Melbourne Cup, when we all rush towards summer, but for freelancers, it feels like a long winter, where commissions and contracts dry up until after Australia Day.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsI contacted former managers and colleagues to see if they had any last minute end-of-year work, but many reported that, thanks to interest rate rises, work was drying up for them too, and many were starting to lay staff off. Many government departments weren’t hiring contractors as they were now considered consultants. And withchanges to employment lawsto make casuals permanent after 12 months, many organisations stopped hiring altogether.And that’s not includingnonexistent “ghost jobs”, or those which I’d discover had already been awarded internally, wasting pointless hours and sometimes days of preparation. I was often working full work days on applications to often short deadlines. The attic remained cluttered, my novel unwritten.As I headed into freelance winter, I tried not to worry. I was lucky: we had some savings to draw on. My wife was still working and manages our finances brilliantly. And we’d fixed our mortgage just before interest rates went up.But if there’s one job worse than not having a job, it’s looking for a job: stressfulandboring, with neither satisfaction nor remuneration.While many job ads called formulti-skilled applicants who could perform a number of often discrete roles, I was often told that I was overqualified: something akin to being told you’re too good-looking to be swiped right. It’s nice to hear but no consolation – and something I suspect is code for “too old”.The first question to start a conversation is often ‘what do you do?’Despite friends and former colleagues expressing surprise I hadn’t landed anything yet – and hiring managers telling me I was an excellent candidate – after more than 90 applications that yielded only a handful of interviews, I was stricken with terror.Our savings rapidly dwindling – even as I was finallyconfident enough about my skills and aptitude– the endless rejection was confidence sapping.What work, if any, could I get? Would I ever work again? What was wrong with me?Worst was the stigma around unemployment. It’s wonderful that we’ve moved beyond the silence around mental health and destigmatised it by openly discussing it. But admitting you’re unemployed, as opposed to being “between jobs” or on “a career break”, is still a fraught subject. For most of that year, I didn’t tell anyone. I didn’t want to burden them with my troubles. And, to be honest, I felt ashamed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Why doesn’t the government understand how hard it is? | Laura AzzamRead moreThe first question to start a conversation is often “what do you do?”. We are what we do – I’m a writer, you’re a plumber. Some of us have our job title as a prefix – doctor, professor, captain. And we still think of our jobs as our “living”.What does that make those of us who can’t find work?Many positions I applied for had hundreds of applicants. And I know many people my age who’d reached the top of their professions, only to find that they couldn’t find anything for months, even as many Gen Xers like me will probably – thanks to low super balances caused by relentless automation, casualisation and wage stagnation for most of our working lives – never enjoy the retirement our Boomer parents do, and will probably have to keep working until we cannot physically do so.Although we may measure success in terms of job titles and salary packages, that difficult year I learned a lot about what itreallymeans.Finding the resilience to keep going – with my family and friends’ support – has made me stronger, a little wiser, and most importantly, more compassionate for those in the same situation.Still, although I’m lucky that I did end up landing an interesting job, I’m more conscious than ever of the precarity of even so-called “stable” employment. And with thelooming spectre of a Trumpcession, there might be many more of us out of work.Perhaps now is the time to destigmatise being unemployed, and to distinguish who we are from what we do.Sunil Badamiis a writer, academic and broadcasterExplore more on these topicsUnemploymentOpinionAustralian economyWelfarecommentShareReuse this content"

This was first the United Kingdom and then the United States.Without properly considering other options, successive federal governments have intensified this policy with the Aukus agreement and locked Australia into dependency on the US fordecades to come.A more imaginative and innovative government would have investigated different ways to achieve a strong and independent national defence policy.One that, for instance, didn’t require Australia tosurrender its sovereigntyto a foreign power. Nor require the acquisition of fabulously expensive nuclear-powered submarines and the building of overpriced, under-gunned surface warships, such as theHunter frigates.With friends like Trump, who needs Aukus? ALP members are demanding an answer | Paul DaleyRead moreIn fact, in an age of rapidly improving uncrewed systems, Australia does not need any crewed warships or submarines at all.Instead, Australia should lean into a military philosophy that I describe in myupcoming book, The Big Fix: Rebuilding Australia’s National Security. This is known as the “strategic defensive”.What is the strategic defensive?The strategic defensive is a method of waging war employed throughout history, although the term’s use only dates to the early 19th century.It doesn’t require a state to defeat its attacker. Rather, the state must deny the aggressor the ability to achieve their objectives.The strategic defensive best suits “status quo states” such as Australia. The people of status quo states are happy with what they have. Their needs can be met without recourse to intimidation or violence.These states also tend to be militarily weak relative to potential aggressors, and aren’t aggressors themselves.In short: if war eventuates, Australia’s only goal is to prevent a change to the status quo.In this way, strategic defensive would suit very well as the intellectual foundation of Australia’s security policy.Strong reasons for a strategic defensive approachThere are also sound military and technological reasons why Australia should frame its security around the strategic defensive.First, defence is the naturallystronger position in war, compared to attack.It is harder to capture ground (including sea and airspace) than it is to hold it. All aggressors must attack into the unknown, bringing their support with them. Defenders, by contrast, can fall back on to a known space and the provisions it can supply.Military thinkers generally agree that to succeed in war, an attacker needs athree-to-onestrength advantage over the defender.And the wide water moat surrounding the Australian continent greatly complicates and increases the cost of any aggressor’s effort to harm us.Australia could also use weapons now available to enhance the inherent power of being the defending side. Its task need only be making any attack prohibitively expensive, in terms of equipment and human life.Long-range strike missiles and drones, combined with sensors, provide the defending nation with theopportunity to create a lethal killing zonearound it. This is whatChinahas done in the East and South China Seas.Australia can do the same by integrating missiles, drones and uncrewed maritime vessels with a sensor network linked to a command-control-targeting system.Missiles and drones are a better buy when compared with the nuclear-powered submarines Australia hopes to acquire from the United States, as well as the warships – including more submarines – the government plans to build in the Osborne and Henderson shipyards.And most importantly, they are available now.A smarter strategyA defensive network also makes strategic sense for Australia, unlike the plannedAukusnuclear-powered submarines. Australia has no need to operate in distant waters, such as those off the coast of China.In addition, Australia can afford so few vessels that their deterrence effect is not credible. Missiles and drones are vastly cheaper, meaning Australia can buy them in the thousands.Instead of wasting more time on the flawed Aukus submarine program, we must go to plan B now | Peter BriggsRead moreAustralia is making the mistake of focusing on the platform – expensive ships and planes – rather than the effect needed: the destruction of a potential enemy with swarms of weapons.In fact, the age of large crewed warships, both on and below the sea, is coming to an end. Long-range strike technology means the sea can now be controlled from the land. Rapidly improving sensors make it impossible for attackers to hide on, below or above the surface of the ocean.A better bet would be for Australia toinvestin uncrewed surface and sub-surface maritime vessels to patrol its approaches, as well as large numbers of land-based launchers and missiles.For a small power such as Australia,investingin this makes more sense than a small, bespoke number of extremely expensive and vulnerable warships.It’s not too late to rethinkIt is clear Australian leaders have decided to intensify Australia’s dependence on the US rather than seeking to create a military capable ofsecuring the nation on our own.The cost is nigh-on ruinous in terms of not just money, but also the entanglement in foreign-led wars and potential reputational loss.Perhaps worst of all, the nation is making itself into a target – possibly a nuclear target – if war between the US and China was to eventuate.This need not have been the outcome of the government’s recent defence reviews. But it’s not too late to rethink.By adopting a different military philosophy as the guide for its security decision-making, Australia could manage its security largely on its own.This only requires leaders with a willingness to think differently.Albert Palazzo is adjunct professor in the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of New South Wales Canberra and University of New South Wales Sydney.

What if each of us had the chance to build our very own Grand Design, letting our streets be lined with personal visions, liberated from the identikit brick boxes offered by the usual big housebuilders?A glimpse of this world exists, sort of, on the outskirts of Bicester in Oxfordshire, where the country’s biggest self-build experiment has been under way for 10 years.Graven Hillis a place where rooftops tilt, zigzag and bulge, where windows come in circles, squares and triangles, or poke out from unexpected places. There are balconies fashioned from glass, steel and rustic timber clinging to facades of stone, brick, wood and render, along with every type of fibre-cement board available. Wandering the freshly tarmacked streets feels like walking through a building supplies catalogue. Panels of fake wood are proudly fixed next to rusted cor-ten steel and bits of slate, as if residents were fed fizzy drinks and let loose in a cladding warehouse.Tabatha chose a unicorn-topped weathervane for her turret. Barnaby wanted a penguin reading a book on hisThere are low-slung bungalows and houses that want to be towers. Beachy timber chalets sit alongside neo-Georgian brick townhouses while puffed-up, porticoed piles stand next to angular metallic concoctions. There’s even a stripy blue house with a gigantic giraffe parked outside. Why choose one style when you can have them all?“It took us a long time to find an architect who didn’t laugh when we said we wanted turrets,” says Frevisse Dearsley-Hitchcock. Her and her husband Giles’s home, designed by the accommodating local practiceLAPD, is one of the most striking of the lot. It stands as a bright blue New England-style house with (fibre-cement) clapboard walls flanked by two octagonal turrets, one each for their children. They are crowned with bright teal cupolas topped with weathervanes (“Tabatha chose a unicorn; Barnaby wanted a penguin reading a book”), while the eaves are punctuated by porthole windows and cutout stars. “We’ve heard local kids say that a Disney princess lives here,” says Frevisse. “I think I disappointed them one day when I came out in my hi-vis and boots.”View image in fullscreenFit for a princess … the Dearsley-Hitchcocks’ twin-turret home.Photograph: Oliver WainwrightTheir dream princess castle has been a long time coming. The couple acquired the plot in 2018 for £260,000, drawn to the fact that sites at Graven Hill come with outline planning permission and, for this particular plot, “no limits on what we could do”. There were limits, however, on what their builders were capable of. Having lived in the US for years, the couple wanted features such as a basement, a laundry chute and pocket doors that slide back into the walls, none of which proved easy to realise.“The concrete basement was still wonky when we had to sign it off,” says Frevisse. “When the timber framer arrived, he didn’t know where to begin. We’d already spent £400,000 in the ground before we even began the house.” Seven years later, it’s still not finished, but they hope to move in by the end of the year – at a total cost of double what they planned. “Hindsight is a wonderful thing,” says Giles. You can picture Kevin McCloud’s gleefully furrowed brow.Graven Hill may sound like a Channel 4-funded reality experiment, but this radical neighbourhood is actually the brave venture of Cherwell district council. Inspired by the famous self-built suburb ofAlmere in the Netherlands, the local authority bought the 188 hectare site from the MoD in 2014 and set up a council-owned development company to manage the process.Glenn Howells Architects drew up amaster plan featuring 11 different character areas, ranging from “tree-lined boulevards” to “urban lanes”, with detailed “plot passports” prescribing building heights and material palettes. More or less freedom would be granted depending on the character area, in an attempt to avoid total anarchy – although, in reality, these different zones are indiscernible in the resulting hodgepodge. To get things going, the first plots were released to 10 “pioneer” residents at a knockdown price of £100,000 each, with the agreement that their trials and tribulations would be broadcast in a special series ofGrand Designs: The Streets.View image in fullscreenAnimal magic … Lynn Pratt’s pangolin house, left.Photograph: Oliver Wainwright“The whole thing just sounded amazing,” says Lynn Pratt, one of the pioneer residents, who moved here from a rural cottage in Northamptonshire, attracted to the idea of being part of a neighbourly community with nearby amenities and a bus stop. Her “pangolin” house, designed by local architectAdrian James, features scaly tiles that wrap around a big oast house-inspired roof. “It was billed as ‘a development like no other’,” Pratt recalls, “with all the houses to be high-spec, low-energy and forward-thinking, with no big developers allowed. They said they wanted a wide demographic, with a variety of ages and incomes, so it wasn’t just fancy dream homes. I built my whole house for about £350,000, including the land.”In Pratt and her neighbours’ eyes, the built reality has now strayed from that original vision. The 2,000 homes were intended to be a mix of self-build and “custom build”, where owners could personalise elements, but the latter have often veered towards the usual cookie-cutter housebuilder fare. There are now plenty of bog standard brick houses, with some grey cladding stuck on to give a half-hearted “custom” air.“I don’t know if it was Brexit or Covid,” says Pratt, “but suddenly things changed. I know costs have gone up, but the vision now feels very different. There’s very little self-build now – they’ve priced most people out.” She is also still waiting for the grocery shop and bus stop to arrive, while the pioneer homes remain cut off, stranded from the rest of the development across a field.I know costs have gone up but the vision now feels very different. There’s very little self-build nowAnother major bone of contention has been the affordable housing. Graven Hill is required to provide 30% such homes, but many feel they have been designed in a way that has created an “us and them” division between self-builders and renters. The housing association properties stand as incongruous rows of long brick terraces, as if airlifted here from a 1980s council estate.“It’s the weakest part of the whole development,” says John McCormack, a retired architect and fellow pioneer resident, who used to work in housing. “All of the different tenures were supposed to be integrated, but it’s ended up feeling like a series of ghettoes. Good design doesn’t have to cost more, but the design quality of the affordable housing is almost zero.”View image in fullscreenFour more Graven Hill builds.Composite: Oliver WainwrightResidents of some of the shared ownership homes have complained ofblack mould and freezing rooms, arguing that their properties don’t live up to their eco claims (Graven Hill says tests carried out met environmental performance standards). There have also been grumblings about the lack of promised amenities. Despite 600 homes now being occupied, there is still no mini-supermarket or community centre, and the planned pub looks unlikely to materialise.“We have faced significant challenges,” says Adrian Unitt, managing director of the Graven Hill Village Development Company. “You can build a shop unit, but getting someone to lease it is a different story.” He is standing in the sales suite of what is known as the “village centre”, which turns out to be an apartment block clad in the trademark busy variety of materials, with a coffee shop, wine bar and dentist on the ground floor.Across the road stands aprimary school designed by Architype architects, crowned with clunky rooftop railings that make it look like the scaffolding has been left up. A site nearby, formerly earmarked for a health centre, will now become a care home, after theGP provider pulled out, while residents are still awaiting a community centre where they can hold parties and events.What does Unitt make of the criticisms that Graven Hill has drifted from its original vision? “It’s a very difficult model to make stack up,” he says. “If I’m selling the land, with foundations and services, I’m getting about a third of the income that a usual developer would get. But I’m still delivering all the roads, the amenities, and theSection 106 affordable housing obligations.”View image in fullscreenCurious charms … Graven Hill from the air.Photograph: Eddy Gong/ Beauty and BicesterIt’s also very slow. If it stuck to the self-build route, the company has said, the development wouldn’t be completed until 2050. Compounding the issue, says Unitt, is ongoing damage caused by the fact that the neighbourhood is a permanent building site, with plot owners each building to their own schedules. The council asked for the infrastructure and amenities to be built first, but Unitt estimates the company has spent more than £2m rectifying kerbs, green space and play areas that have been damaged by construction crews, and “trashed by people parking all over the place”.Parking is one of the things, along with where to keep the bins, that it is hoped will be improved in the next phase of the masterplan, currently being reworked by consultants Lambert Smith Hampton, after anoutcry from residents over claims of increased density and lack of green space. Unitt says there will be “more rigidity” in the design code, after feedback from the council, but residents fear a slide towards business-as-usual after sites that were once allocated for self-builders are now being built by the developer, due to apparent lack of demand. Looking at the plans, there is no indication of how many self-build plots there will be in the next phase.Is custom build the future of housing?Read moreBy any standards, Graven Hill is a chaotic jumble. Homes are scattered with abandon, designed with little concern for making a coherent place, or how they meet the street, with stretches of wall, fence, hedge and tarmac pasted at will, and parking all over the place. But it has its curious charms. It is a very English vision of individual ambition. Of people’s determination to build their own little castles, despite the expense and trauma of it all. And of how some people, given freedom, will actually opt to build something quite conventional.“To be honest, I don’t know if I would recommend self-build,” says Frevisse Dearsley-Hitchcock. “Other people have had a smoother ride than us, but you’ve got to be in it for the long haul.” Still, they’ve had plenty of fun along the way. Most recently, Giles has been busy fitting LED striplights to their blue house’s gables. “We were inspired by the Empire State Building in New York,” he says. “It’s lit up with different colours every night!”Explore more on these topicsArchitectureHousingOxfordshirePlanning policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It looks fantastic – but it was pretty hairy’Interviews byChris BroughtonMon 21 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Apr 2025 17.46 EDTShareRay Winstone, played CarlinOn the day I got expelled from drama school, all the boys I’d been there with were going to audition for this prison drama film at theBBC. I went along too, just so I could go for a drink with them afterwards to say goodbye. While I was waiting I got talking to the receptionist. I told her what had happened and she said: “Why don’t you go in and meet the director? It can’t hurt.”So I had a chat and a laugh with Alan Clarke and he told me about the part of Carlin – he said it was written for a Scottish guy, which I’m obviously a million miles from. But I’d been boxing since I was 11 and had this walk which made an impression on him as he saw me out. I found out later the walk was the only reason I got the part.Alan, and Roy Minton, who wrote Scum, were tough old boys but talked about films and literature and wanted to pass on what they’d learned to kids like us. The performances came mostly from Clarkey’s direction – he could whisper in your ear before a scene and upset you in a second if that’s the emotion he was after. We’d have gone to the ends of the earth for him.View image in fullscreenWho’s the daddy now? … Ray Winstone as Carlin.Photograph: Ronald GrantWhat I brought to that role was what I’d experienced by the age of 19. For example, the scene where Carlin takes out the B-wing daddy was supposed to last longer, but having seen someone being hit with an iron bar I knew the shocking thing about real life violence is it’s over quick and it hurts. Every slap we got from one of the screws was real. It was the same with the swearing and the racist language – if that hadn’t been in there, you’d have lost the reality of it.After the BBC version of Scum was banned, I kind of retired from acting, but when I got a call saying it was going to be made again for cinemas, the deal was for two films – the producers also wanted me for That Summer!, which was going to be filmed in Torquay. I was only offered £1,800 for that, but I thought: “Eight weeks by the sea; wine, women and song.” So I did it for a holiday, really.A few characters had to be re-cast when we made the second Scum, which brought a freshness to it. For example, David Threlfall and Micky Ford played Archer in a totally different way, but both were blinding. As for the rest of us, Clarkey said: “Don’t do anything different, don’t try and do it better, because it’s already there.” He wanted to keep the performances off the cuff, because that felt more raw and real.There were a few other changes, though. In the BBC version Carlin takes on another boy as his “missus”, but I said to Alan: “He’s not a lifer, that wouldn’t happen.” He thought I was uncomfortable with it – maybe I was, to be fair – and that part was cut. In hindsight, I think that was wrong.Over the years people have shouted: “Who’s the daddy now?” or “Where’s your tool?” at me. I just give them a wave and a smile. Once a big fella started staring at me on the tube like he was going to start something. I thought: “Here we go …” Eventually he said: “Were you in Scum? Fucking good film.”Phil Daniels, played RichardsI heard that part of the reason the first Scum was banned is that the then head of the BBC was an ex-magistrate who had visited borstals. There are lots of shocking incidents in the film – beatings, rape and suicide – which he said wouldn’t all have happened in so short a time.Obviously misbehaviour was part and parcel of making the film. We had a special bus laid on to take us to the location, an old psychiatric hospital. One day, the driver got off the bus but left the keys in the ignition and Raymondo stole it. We drove round picking up patients and taking them for a ride.View image in fullscreenTough time … Phil Daniels and John Judd.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyWhen Carlin hits my character, Stripey Richards, with a sock full ofsnooker balls, the fact the scene’s done in one continuous take helps sell it. You see Ray pick up the balls from the snooker table and put them in the sock and the camera follows him right up to the point where he clocks me. There’s a moment where his hands are out of shot, and someone surreptitiously swapped that sock for another full of ping pong balls covered in papier-mache. I still ended up with a mark on my face, though. When Ray put the boot in a couple of times afterwards I learned to lift my bum in the air so I got kicked in the arse rather than the balls.The sock was full of ping pong balls. I still ended up with a mark on my face thoughA load of extra boys were brought in from a youth club to make up the numbers for the “murderball” scene in the gym, which ends in a Black v white fight. People were jumping on each other’s backs and even if it wasn’t quite as violent as it looks on screen, things became boisterous in the extreme.Why Alan Clarke is the key British film-maker whose maverick spirit lives onRead moreIt was the same during theriotat the end. Alan and the cameramen stayed up on a rostrum out of the way and just let us get on with it. The tables got spontaneously piled up and because we’d been eating baked beans and mashed potato, that’s what ended up all over the floor, which became like an ice rink. It looks fantastic, but it was pretty hairy – we were all slipping around and just trying to stay on our feet.Scum is on UK and Irish digital platforms nowExplore more on these topicsFilmHow we madeRay WinstoneUK criminal justiceBBCDrama filmsDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

As they prepare to take on their colossal nemesis and his gleaming, emotionally unavailable emissary Silver Surfer (Julia Garner), Pedro Pascal’s Reed Richards, Joseph Quinn’s Johnny Storm and Ebon Moss-Bachrach’s the Thing will be doing so in the knowledge that they’re protecting more than just the future of this Apollo-era-inspired version of Earth. And if you’ve even lightly skimmed the back catalogue of Fantastic Four comics, you’ll know this is no ordinary pregnancy; and certainly no ordinary infant.In its print incarnation, the first child of Storm and Richards grows up to become Franklin Richards, a superhero so powerful he once daydreamed an entire pocket universe into existence during a sugar crash.View image in fullscreenNo ordinary pregnancy … Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm/Invisible Woman in The Fantastic Four: First Steps.Photograph: Marvel StudiosImagine Jack-Jack from The Incredibles if he could rewrite the laws of physics every time someone told him it was bedtime, and you’re starting to get the idea. At one point, Reed had to zap his own son with a psychic dampening device to stop Franklin from unconsciously folding the fabric of reality into an origami swan out of existential despair. We’re talking teething problems if “teething” includes accidentally erasing causality because nap time was five minutes late.How this affects the plotline of First Steps is yet to be seen, and it’s still possible Franklin will remain a foetus throughout the events of Matt Shakman’s film. But there’s every chance that the arrival of this almost impossibly overcooked character is the very thing that’s brought Galactus to Earth.We still don’t know how theFantastic Fourwill end up in the main Marvel reality by the time Avengers: Doomsday hits cinemas next year, or even whether the new Robert Downey Jr-essayed version of Doctor Doom hails from the same timeline as Richards et al. But already the blogosphere is buzzing with theories that Franklin will ultimately be responsible for a soft Marvel reboot, one that prunes the dead weight from the MCU and maybe restores Iron Man, Black Widow and T’Chaka to the main continuity.In the comics, the Fantastic Four were the first modernMarvelsuperheroes, debuting in 1961 when Spider-Man, the X-Men and The Hulk were all still twinkles in the eyes of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. So it makes absolute sense for the studio to introduce them in a world where no other capes exist just yet.What we don’t yet understand is why this particular Earth has caught the attention of a planet-eating space god in a hat the size of a football stadium. But if it’s not Franklin Richards popping into reality, then the movie’s title, Marvel’s relentless teasing of Storm’s pregnancy, and that brooding snapshot of an empty crib are going to go down as the greatest misdirect in comic book movie history.Is that Galactus himself stomping around at the end of the trailer in size 40,000 boots, striding through this Jetsons-inspired take on Manhattan? If so, it seems Marvel may have rather downsized the supervillain – a cosmic behemoth canonically capable of munching on entire solar systems. Then again, the celestial gutbucket has walked the surface of the Earth in the comics before, and at least Hollywood isn’t rendering him here as agiant cosmic fart lurking menacingly in the clouds.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekSuperhero moviesMarvelFantastic FourComics and graphic novelsPedro PascalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Context, motivation and, for the most part, IraqisPeter BeaumontI was there with US soldiers in 2006 and can see why the film-makers zoomed in on them so closely. But it results in glaring flawsMon 21 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Apr 2025 09.52 EDTShareThink back to 2006.Iraqwas at the peak of its conflicts. A horrific sectarian war was raging, and al-Qaida in Iraq and other insurgent groups, both Sunni and Shia, held sway in substantial areas of the country.Suicide bombers and IEDs were a daily occurrence targeting both Iraqis and foreign forces, and in cities and towns from Fallujah and Ramadi, to Baqubah and Mosul, US troops were engaged in urban warfare. It was as much about ambush and hit-and-run attacks as about formal battles.Alex Garland’s new film Warfareis a re-enactment of one of these clashes – the final days of the battle of Ramadi. Garland and his co-director, former US Navy SealRay Mendoza, who fought during the engagement, have made much of their desire for authenticity. Their film is based, they say, as accurately as possible on the memories of those involved.Its aim, they have suggested, is to provide as immersive an experience of combat as possible for audiences with no grasp of the reality of conflict.In some senses, it succeeds. Warfare is a film that captures the essence of the Iraq of almost 20 years ago, down to minute details including the furnishing of the Iraqi house where much of the action takes place.The Navy Seal team who are its focus are inserted into Ramadi after dark, occupying several houses to provide sniper support for Marines operating nearby in the city. A sense of mounting risk is brilliantly conveyed. The violence, when it occurs, is unexpected and shocking, for all that it is anticipated.While the seriesGeneration Kill, depicting the 2003 invasion, dealt with fast and mobile fighting, Warfare is defined by the claustrophobia that permeated the later war. Soldiers were trapped in vehicles threatened by the ever-present roadside bombs, trapped in outposts under mortar fire or holed up in the houses seized in hostile territory by the “small kill teams”.The consequences of the violence are portrayed unsparingly, including what it means to be around those who are badly wounded, inspiring a kind of collective shock.Garland is also clever in using the technological trappings of modern war. He shows us the battlefield sensor systems I first encountered in Iraq, ghostly renderings on which you could see the body heat of approaching insurgent fighters, piped into combat computer systems from drones and other cameras.But where Warfare is unsuccessful is when it falls into traps of its own making. If its overarching message is to emphasise a pointless exchange in a pointless war, Garland’s artistic choices left me wondering at the purpose of the film. For while Garland and Mendoza have made much of its realism, Warfare covers little new ground in its depiction of violence.Every generation of film-makers has thrown up those wanting to show a version of war “as it really is”, from Francis Ford Coppola’s shocking visual metaphor of sacrifice at the conclusion of Apocalypse Now, to Steven Spielberg’sbloody landing scene in Saving Private Ryanand Sam Peckinpah’s stylised mayhem inCross of Iron. All of those, however, were far more conventional films that sought to engage viewers with relatable characters and storylines.The problem with documenting or representing war, as it is experienced at the most visceral level by those who fight in it, is that it is essentially a fool’s errand. Proximity to violence, contrary to the famous dictum ofRobert Capa, that most celebrated of war photographers, does not necessarily add value or clarity of meaning. Instead, like zooming in on a digital picture, it has the tendency to break into individual pixels. Meaning falls apart. Though this film is determined to plunge the viewer immediately into the experience, we learn almost nothing of the soldiers, their motivations, their personal attachment or the conflicts within the unit.And this reflects a second, perhaps more serious, set of problems with Warfare. The solemn reverence for the integrity of the subject matter – the soldiers, and the recollections of the soldiers who fought in the engagement – leads to a kind of censorship by default. Largely missing from the picture are not only the Iraqis of Ramadi, where insurgents are seen as flitting figures and the civilian family in the house as a voiceless inconvenience, but any sense of how the soldiers view them.Warfare review – film-makers’ message gets lost in the deafening blizzard of battleRead moreThe reality is that many of the US soldiers I and other journalists encountered were frequently racist about Iraqis. And unlike the taciturn soldiers in Warfare, their views, for better or for worse, and their rationalisations for being in Iraq were often articulated even in situations of extremis.All of which leads to a final issue. In the decision not to articulate or aim for a wider parsing of a controversial and unpopular war, Garland excludes the possibility of any Iraqis in the film appearing as fully realised. The absence of Iraqis means that the war is merely something thathappensto these American soldiers. It is an experience to be endured and nothing more. The film’s sympathies may be anti-war but in its exclusive interest in the suffering of its young American protagonists, its viewpoint is colonial.And as artists who have successfully conveyed their vision of what they believe conflict means have long understood – from Homer and Tolstoy to Erich Maria Remarque and Joseph Heller, to Spielberg and Coppola – war is an activity that occurs in a human context. Separated from that context (and to steal from the title ofDavid Axe’s graphic novel and website), war is boring. It really is.Peter Beaumont is a senior international correspondent for the Guardian.

He points to a tattoo on his heavily inked torso that sums it up. “It says ‘You need me’,” he explains in a tobacco-stained California burr. “When I did this tattoo, I was such a piece-of-shit drug addict who only cared about himself. I thought it was funny. I don’t need you guys – you need me.” It inspired You N33d Me, one of the best tracks on the sax-blasting post-punk band’s electrifying, sort-of-self-titled fourth album Viagr Aboys. Hooked on amphetamines, pills and Valium at various points in his past, Murphy has been, by his own admission, the last person anybody needed around.But the strongest thing Murphy is consuming when we meet on a recent Thursday afternoon is black coffee. We’re in the lair of Shrimptech Enterprises, the independent label and umbrella company for the Swedish band’s increasingly hectic operations: they’ve gradually climbed out of the toilet circuit over the last decade, and business is booming. This is where Viagra Boys write and record, design merch and poster art, all six members punching in for regular hours most weekdays. Our chat is soundtracked by the insistent chime of a piano being tuned. Here, Murphy is a cog in an increasingly smooth-running machine.Born in the small city of San Rafael, California, to an American father and a Swedish mother, Murphy’s upbringing was strict. “They were very obsessed with healthy foods,” he says. “I never drank soda, didn’t watch TV, all that stuff was kind of banned.” Would it be fair to say the rest of his life has been a reaction against that? “It really has.”A bored, unruly skater kid in his teens, Murphy began drinking and stealing from his parents to buy whatever drugs he could get his hands on. He was arrested for the first time aged 15 and was in rehab for drug addiction by 17. In an initially successful bid to get sober, Murphy then moved to Stockholm to live with his aunt and ended up staying. He dropped out of high school and became a tattooist, but sobriety didn’t last, especially after rock’n’roll, he says, “swept me off my feet”.The other Viagra Boys, Stockholm punk scene veterans, recruited Murphy after seeing him sing a Mariah Carey song drunk at karaoke. He had never been in a proper band and felt out of his depth, but he pressed on with the attitude of: “OK, rock’n’roll, let’s go. Let’s do this until we’re dead. I maybe thought that would come sooner than later.”Viagra Boys’ 2018 debut singleSportswas an addictively funny satire of hypermasculinity (their name drew from similar inspiration); their debut album Street Worms, released that year, railed against Sweden’s growing rightwing populism with wit and muscle. But the band’s steady rise has been built chiefly on relentless, riotous touring. Murphy, shirtless and tracksuit-trousered, stokes the crowd into rising levels of derangement – at their2023 Glastonbury set, someone in the crowd was tossing their toddler into the air – as saxophone player Oskar Carls writhes around the stage in outrageously short shorts.View image in fullscreenOutrageous … Sebastian Murphy performing with Viagra Boys at Coachella festival earlier this month.Photograph: Arturo Holmes/Getty Images for CoachellaIn an uptight world, a group dedicated to getting loose like this – so loose Murphy has the word tattooed on his forehead in Swedish – has major appeal: last year Viagra Boys played US arenas supporting Queens of the Stone Age. Their biggestworld touryet began this month at Coachella and will end 60 dates later at London’s Alexandra Palace. Murphy surmises that a lot of the fans “are just freaks, you know. Freaks recognise freaks. It’s freeing for a lot of people to see some dude that has clearly no muscles and is just letting his gut hang out have a good time.”There was a time when Murphy wouldn’t get on stage without taking amphetamines first. But as his bandmates started having kids and settling down, the pace had to slow to remain sustainable. Murphy credits bassist and de facto bandleader Henrik “Benke” Höckert with gradually tightening things up. “I would always be so pissed off at him if he decided to stay sober for a tour,” Murphy says. “I was busy with doing drugs and thinking about myself; he was busy planning shit. Making it work as a viable source of income. Which would not be possible if we were fucked up every day.”At the same time, the crippling hangovers and attendant anxiety started to become too much. “I still know how to party for sure,” says Murphy. “But I definitely know my limits now.” Drugs will never be entirely off the menu – “I can’t really help it when I’m on tour,” he admits – but these days he mostly sticks to beer (just the 30 or so a week). He goes to the gym and plays squash to try to stay in shape. He’s even stopped getting tattoos because he says he can’t take the pain any more. “These days if I stub my toe I’ll be crying for a week.”In 2021, the band’s founding guitarist Benjamin Vallé died aged 47, shaking them all hard. They supported each other through the loss: where some men struggle to discuss difficult emotions, Viagra Boys have no such problem. “We talk to each other about everything,” says Murphy. I ask him if a newfound respect for death prompting him to change his lifestyle. He prefers to think of it as not wasting a good thing. “I’ve got a great fiancee, I’ve got an apartment,” he says. “I can afford things. Life is really easy and really good. I don’t want to fuck it up.”‘Apparently, he had a fist fight with King Charles’: the jawdropping life of Luca Prodan, Argentina’s punk godRead moreHis visual artist fianceeMoa Romanova, who did the artwork for their third album, 2022’s Cave World, has a studio next door to Shrimptech. At one point she drops in with their dog Uno – both are subjects of songs on Viagr Aboys.Uno IIis a strange tale of conspiratorial anxiety seen through the eyes of an Italian greyhound with chronic dental problems. River King is a piano ballad in which Murphy croons with charming imperfection about Chinese takeaways and calming domesticity. It’s a disarmingly gentle end to the album: have Viagra Boys finally gone soft? Murphy smiles a gold-toothed grin. “We’ve always been soft. That’s been the problem all along.”Viagr Aboys is released via Shrimptech Enterprises on 25 AprilExplore more on these topicsPunkFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A new series aims to do justice to his story – and those who fought to clear his nameMon 21 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Apr 2025 12.51 EDTShareOn 22 July 2005, 27-year-oldJean Charles de Menezeswas shot and killed by firearms officers on the London underground shortly after boarding a train. The information relayed by the Metropolitan police at the time was that he had leapt over the ticket barriers at Stockwell station and was wearing a bulky coat under which officers thought he was hiding a bomb.The incident occurred two weeks after the 7/7 bombings on London’s transport network, where 52 people were killed, and the day after a copycat attack in which four men tried – and mercifully failed – to detonate devices on three underground trains and a bus; the bombers in the latter incidents fled the scene, triggering a police manhunt. It later emerged that De Menezes was innocent and the intelligence on him was flawed. But such was the impact of that early narrative – the one where his actions and appearance made him seem guilty at a time when police were on high alert – that, 20 years on, it is still what most people remember.It’s certainly what screenwriterJeff Pope(Philomena, Stan & Ollie) recalled when he was first approached about writing the drama series Suspect: The Shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes. “My subconscious memory was that it was a terrible accident, where Jean Charles had unwittingly been the architect of his own downfall, because he had vaulted the barrier and run down the escalator. And when the firearms officers got on the train, he challenged them and it all ended in horror.” But then Pope did some digging, reading the twoIndependent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) reports, the inquest transcript plus the 2007 health and safety at work prosecution, where a jury found the Met police had breached health and safety rules and put the public at risk. From these, he gleaned that De Menezes had in fact walked into the station, picked up a newspaper and got on the train without incident. “I was certain by the time I had absorbed the research that this was a poorly planned and poorly executed operation that morning.”View image in fullscreenRussell Tovey as Brian Paddick in Suspect: The Shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes.Photograph: Des Willie/Disney+A tense and frequently shocking ensemble piece written by Pope and directed by Paul Andrew Williams, Suspect details the before, during and after of the shooting, laying out the events that led to the misidentification of De Menezes, the shooting in the train carriage and the ensuing prevarications and inconsistencies from police. We see De Menezes, played by newcomer Edison Alcaide, in the days before his death, working two jobs – an electrician by day, he washed dishes in a restaurant at night – and talking to his mother back in Brazil who frets about her son living in a city where bombers are targeting civilians. We also meet the Met’s top brass including commissioner Ian Blair (Conleth Hill), who rushes out public statements before he has all the facts; Cressida Dick (Emily Mortimer), gold commander of the surveillance operation that led to De Menezes’s shooting; and deputy assistant commissioner, Brian Paddick (played by Russell Tovey), who is appalled at the circulating half-truths and smears on De Menezes’ character.“It’s like we’re saying: ‘Sorry we killed you, but it is your own fault,’” he remarks to another officer.‘Filming the shooting was heavy – none of us wanted to avoid the reality of what happened’Before taking the role, Tovey already knew Paddick, having met him through Stonewall and Terrence Higgins Trust events. “I’ve always found him a bit of a hero figure as an out gay man who had got to that position within the Met while being vocal about LGBTQI+ rights,” he says. “To be able to hang out with him and pick his brains for this was a wonderful situation to be in.” In the aftermath of the shooting, a question mark hung over exactly when senior officers knew the wrong man had been shot, and whether they released deliberately misleading information about De Menezes, knowing he was innocent. Paddick gave evidence that contradicted statements made by Blair – the implication being that Blair had lied. This ultimately led to Paddick being sidelined at the Met and leaving his job.“So you see what sticking your neck on the line and making sure the truth is upheld does to someone’s career,” says Tovey.View image in fullscreenEdison Alcaide as Jean Charles de Menezes in Suspect: The Shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes.Photograph: Stefania Rosini/Disney+In the drama, there is an impossibly tense standoff between Paddick and Blair, with Paddick politely asserting his version of the timeline and Blair calmly and repeatedly telling his deputy he is mistaken. “You must do what you have to do,” says Blair, “but we both know the penalty for not telling the truth.” “That’s where good drama comes in,” says Game of Thrones starConleth Hill, who plays Blair. “Nobody knows what happened in those meetings apart from the two of them. But [as an actor] you can’t torture yourself about that when you’ve got a good script in front of you.” Though Blair emerges from the story as slippery and over concerned about reputation, Hill says he is sympathetic to the pressure he was under “during all this panic” and was never going to play him as an out-and-out villain. “The responsibility is to tellthestory, not his story. My father was a news cameraman during the worst of the Troubles and I always admired his unbiased presentation, no matter what he felt himself.”Fatal error: 20 years on, the Met still has questions to answer about the killing of Jean Charles de Menezes. A new drama investigates the tragedyRead moreWhile making Suspect, Pope was in close contact with the DeMenezes family, who he says wanted Jean Charles’s story to be told accurately, and the misconceptions about him to be corrected. This was a responsibility keenly felt by Brazilian actor Edison Alcaide in playing De Menezes. “As a story, it hits close to home,” he says. He knew little of the shooting until he moved to London from Brazil in 2008 where his first home happened to be in Stockwell. “I remember seeing the memorial [containing a mosaic image of De Menezes] outside the tube – that was my first contact with Jean Charles – and thinking: ‘What is this about?’ And of course, the first thing I heard was: ‘Oh, he reacted to the police. He ran away.’”The most shocking scenes in Suspect arrive in the chaos of the shooting – De Menezes was shot at close range seven times in the head – and the blood-soaked stillness that follows. “They were heavy days,” says Alcaide of the filming, noting that the cast and crew wanted “to make the story as truthful as possible. None of us wanted to avoid the tough reality of what happened.” Pope adds: “We thought long and hard about it; we wanted to show exactly what happened, how violent his death was. Seven shots to the head: that actually takes a long time. [Jean Charles’s mother] Maria said to us afterwards: ‘I watched it, and I’m glad I saw it. I’ll never watch it again.’”View image in fullscreenConleth Hill as Ian Blair in Suspect: The Shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes.Photograph: Matthias Clamer/Disney+There is another quietly heroic figure who is often overlooked in accounts of the Menezes case: Lana Vandenberghe, a Canadian secretary and whistleblower at the IPCC who observed with dismay the disconnect between what the public were being told and the evidence being collected by her organisation. And so she photocopied the evidence, put it in a folder and gave it to a journalist at ITN – a decision that cost her her job. In Suspect, she is played by Laura Aikman, who knew nothing of this part of the story. But Pope and producer Kwadjo Dajan had interviewed Vandenberghe as part of their research “and they pretty much asked everything I would want to ask her”, Aikman says. “So I had snippets of that interview saved on my phone. [What was clear] was that she was really scared … because she knew what the consequences could be for her.”Police later raided Vandenberghe’s flat and took her in for questioning. While she was in custody, interviewing officers threatened to charge her with stealing ink and paper. “Ink and paper!” exclaims Pope. “These are gifts to a writer. You can see how desperate they were to land a glove on Lana. They could have put out a statement and talked about breach of trust, or that she was working in confidence. But to try and charge her with criminal theft, it’s pathetic.”If there is an overarching theme in Suspect, beyond the horrific injustice of the killing of De Menezes, it is the long-term impact of misinformation. “In theworld we live in now,” reflects Pope, “there are so many grabs on the truth, so I think that makes this piece really relevant.”Tovey agrees: “The truth doesn’t matter any more … so we have to make these shows because art can educate and bring about change.” He points to the conversations around young men in the wake of Netflix’s hit drama Adolescence. “If you dramatise something, it brings it into existence in a way that no other medium really can. We need these series to tell us who we are and to hold people accountable.”Suspect: The Shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes is on Disney+ from30 April.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionDramaJean Charles de MenezesRussell ToveyConleth HillEmily MortimerJeff PopefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The great graphic novelist Guy Delisle explains why he turned his life into a rollicking readPhil HoadMon 21 Apr 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 21 Apr 2025 05.14 EDTShareIt was one of the biggest talking points of the 19th century: whether a galloping horse lifted all four hooves off the ground simultaneously. Painters struggled with the notion, often wrongly depicting the animals doing a sort of leap, their limbs outstretched front and back. Then, in the 1870s, the great British adventurerEadweard Muybridgeclosed the debate, devising photography with quick enough exposure times to isolate the horses in motion – and airborne.“Lots of people didn’t accept it,” saysGuy Delisle. “When they saw a photograph of the horse gathering its hooves, they said it looked like a dead spider. But when the photographs were projected in sequence, they said, ‘It’s true!’”The new comic book from the revered Quebecois graphic novelist vividly relates the extraordinary life story of Muybridge. It’s a rollicking ride, told in Delisle’s typically light-footed style: Muybridge gatecrashes the early wet-plate photography boom in San Francisco, suffers a near fatal stagecoach accident, fuels America’s desire for epic visions of itself via his pioneering landscape photos, before murdering his wife’s lover (an incident depicted by Delisle in a motion-study-style sequence that’s arresting in every sense). Then Muybridge finally ushers photography into the new era, projecting his photos in sequence so their subjects appear to move, using his niftily titled “zoopraxiscope”, which prefigured the film projector.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Drawn & QuarterlyThese studies are still standard reference for animators, which is how Delisle – who began his career in the profession – first encountered Muybridge. “But I never realised his photos were so old – from the very start of photography,” says the 59-year-old, sipping a cafe noisette in a bar underneath his studio in the French city of Montpellier. With curly black hair, a whitening beard and an unassuming air, he looks like a stockier John Cusack, casually dressed in black fleece, blue twine bracelet and Reebok trainers.Delisle knew Muybridge’s unfeasible life story was perfect comic-strip material. The Canadian made his name with a run of gently compelling travelogue graphic novels that explored the peculiarities, hardships and madnesses of day-to-day life in the likes ofPyongyangandJerusalem, where he found himself for various reasons. Did he identify with Muybridge as a fellow explorer and observer? He sidles around the comparison. “The fact he left home saying, ‘One day I’ll be famous’ – that’s captivating. I also left home early and travelled a lot. I didn’t think I’d become famous, but it happened.” The attraction, however, was mainly aesthetic: “I like the scientific, mechanical side of what Muybridge did. And the result was really beautiful photos. That makes me happy.”What’s thrilling about Delisle’s account is its rich depiction of the heady stampede of new technologies, with painting giving way to photography then to cinema. Muybridge’s patron was industrialist (and equestrian)Leland Stanford, whom Delisle calls “the Elon Musk of his day”. As the pair worked to refine photography, it seemed obsolescence loomed for painting. But it turned out that this new technology complemented, rather than supplanted, the old.“Painters looked at photography as a new tool, like AI today,” says Delisle. “They no longer needed models and could have perfect light all the time.” His book plays off this sweeping artistic conversation, sprinkling his panels with early daguerreotypes, Muybridge’s photos of landscapes and Native Americans, as well as paintings by suddenly-detail-focused realists such as Ernest Meissonier, whose beard was even more straggly than Muybridge’s.There’s an equally healthy collision in Delisle’s shared studio space. Crammed into the rooms of this third-floor apartment in a 19th-century townhouse are comic-book artists, animators and illustrators. One is former video game pioneer and now fellow comic-book artistJordan Mechner. Delisle’s own space, in a cubby-hole around the corner, is a bombsite of pens, ink trays and other art paraphernalia. On his computer, there are sketches he’s colouring for an adaptation of a book by Provençal novelist Jean Echenoz.View image in fullscreen‘Well, comic books seem to be working out for me’ … Guy Delisle self portrait in his studio.Illustration: Guy DelisleDelisle and his wife have been in Montpellier for a decade or so. After years of continually upping sticks due to her work as an administrator for Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), they wanted a more stable environment for their two children. So after winning an award at the prestigious Angoulême international comics festival in 2012 for Jerusalem, its sales of 300,000 making him one of the “happy few” making a living from the profession, Delisle moved on from the travelogue form. His works have since included autobiography, detailing hisstudent job at a Quebec paper factoryand confessionals about his dubious parenting, as well as an account ofan MSF aid worker being taken hostage in Chechnya.His dispatches from Shenzhen, Pyongyang, Burma and Jerusalem – part of the noughties boom of nonfiction storytelling in graphic novels – arrived at precisely the right time, feeding western curiosity about the wilder climes and blank spots of the wider world. “I was in North Korea in May 2001, just before 9/11, when it became part of the axis of evil,” says Delisle. “Everyone wanted to know all the details about it. And I’d had the opportunity to walk around it all, with my hands in my pockets.”North Korea was still sufficiently evil in 2014 to cause the cancellation, three weeks before shooting, of an adaptation of his Pyongyang book. Steve Carell was lined up to play Delisle, with Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski behind the camera. But then cameThe Interview, Seth Rogen’s comedy about assassinating North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The rogue state was so outraged, it hacked Sony’s servers and threatened to bomb cinemas, making similarly themed projects verboten.The film would have pushed Delisle even further into the limelight – maybe one reason why he wasn’t too bothered by its scrapping. He was initially reluctant to make himself a character in his own work, intending to do it only once in Shenzhen, to recount his experiences working in the city as a young animation director. But he kept travelling, and the role of wide-eyed cultural interlocutor struck a chord with readers. “Pyongyang was translated into 26 languages,” he says. “So I said, ‘Well, comic books seem to be working out for me.’”View image in fullscreenDrawing on his own life … Delisle at Angoulême international comics festival in 2015.Photograph: Andia/AlamyEmphasising this naivety, his graphic self becomes more unflattering and block-headed with each book. Delisle had “a feeling of being not very legitimate” – especially when his “giant postcards” were set alongside the more journalistic and politicised works ofJoe Sacco. For his 1990s Palestine books, Sacco had a press card that allowed him access to the Gaza Strip. Delisle was turned down three times by the Israeli authorities for his. “When they heard I was a comic-book artist, I think they thought I was Joe Sacco – ‘Oh no, not him!’”Yet Delisle is rigorous in his own way. “Before understanding something,” he says, “I have to understand it well. But once I do, I tell myself, ‘Yes, I can explain that.’” This pedagogical impulse underlies his travelogues – something he may have inherited from his teacher mother. It’s still visible in his new book about Muybridge, which follows the pioneer’s penchant for breaking things down into constituent elements by rendering his life in easily digestible panels.Like his long-bearded new subject, Delisle is also juggling the challenges of adaptation and the threats of obsolescence that new technology poses. The question of AI looms over the entire comic-book industry. Delisle still draws by hand, but can see how labour-saving AI could be. “For the book, sometimes I needed a picture of a galloping horse viewed from a particular angle. If AI can do that instantly, it could be useful.”But by placing Muybridge’s story in one of the oldest mediums, hand-drawn art, it feels like Delisle is reminding us of something. You just have to look at the margins of his beautifully drawn pages, which are dotted with sketches of flipbooks portraying horses, riders and sparring boxers, each requiring fingers and thumbs to animate them. Drawing, he seems to be saying, is not ready for the knacker’s yard quite yet.Muybridge is published by Drawn & Quarterly on 29 April.

ACE is charged with distributing public and lottery funds to arts organisations in England.Henley said: “I observe the London-centricity in our media. I go around the country, and the people who lead in those places don’t get the half-page columns in our national newspapers as easily as the people who are London based.“There’s a power dynamic there … there’s a sort of imbalance. Maybe the role I have to play when I’m sitting in the corridors of power in London is to be representative of all those places who don’t have a seat at that table.”His comments come after several high-profile London-based arts leaders heavily criticised ACE after the classical venue Wigmore Hall announced that from 2026 it wouldno longer take public subsidies.Instead the venue has secured £10m in pledged donations, with John Gilhooly, the artistic and executive director ofWigmore Hall, saying he was grateful for ACE’s support, but adding that “it has lost its way”.Henley said: “I absolutely respect people who have a view that says we’re doing something that isn’t for their liking or their taste. That’s perfectly reasonable for a public body to be challenged that way … but there are lots and lots of people who I meet who say something different.“You’ve got a lot of groups who are very passionate about all the things we do and maybe negative voices shout louder than positive voices.”The former Classic FM boss said that ACE was “not waging war on classical” after the Wigmore Hall withdrawal and criticism from several figures in the sector. One high-profile broadside came from the former English National Opera artistic director David Pountney, who said ACE “had it in” for opera.Henley said: “It’s really important that we have world class opera at the Royal Ballet here in London, in our capital city that is as good or better artistically as anywhere else in the world. It’s really important. But I also think it’s equally as important that we have a network of grassroots live music venues in towns across this country.”Henley also dismissed suggestions from former National Theatre artistic director Nicholas Hytner, who argued that ACE funding should follow a UK Sport model and pursue “excellence”.Henley said: “UK Sport is absolutely ruthless about winning gold medals, and if you are one of the sports teams that suddenly does well and wins lots of gold medals, you get more funding next time. If you don’t do well, you get less funding. So under his model, if the RSC had an amazing run and the National Theatre had a not-so-good run, money would be taken away from the National Theatre and given to the RSC.“I think that is not really what he’s actually arguing … I think there’s a little bit of misunderstanding there.”The government has ordereda review of ACE, which distributes more than £500m of public money and more than £250m of national lottery money annually, and employs more than 650 people.Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, said the review would be the first step to restore “people’s connection with the arts and culture in every region of the country”.Explore more on these topicsArts Council EnglandLondonArts fundingEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The larger causes of environmental calamity were evidently beyond its remit. But now we have a bland and anodyne sequel narrated by Meryl Streep, which says that rewilding is vital for preserving and reviving endangered species.But by “rewilding” the film basically means, in the first instance, investing in national parks as semi-managed habitats – so in effect, very big zoos. In its opening section, the film actually questions whether there is anywhere purely “wild” on Earth any more. Like an educational video to be shown to parties of schoolchildren, the film gives us brightly feelgood upbeat examples of conservationists working in tandem with politicians, businesses and communities, to rescue various species in the ocean or on land.Of course there is nothing wrong with this. But every so often, the film insists that the point of these victories is that they are sustained economically through improved eco-tourism. Even the horrible business of “trophy hunting” or “canned hunting” – defenceless lions and tigers shot by wealthy hunters – is given a free pass by this film on the grounds that it brings in money which can be invested in conservation. But what about eco-rescues which aren’t economically viable in this way? What, moreover, about the miners and the loggers and the drill-baby-drill fossil fuel enthusiasts who are causing problems? This film mentions them in passing but doesn’t come anywhere near addressing their activities. It’s a frustrating and naive experience.Escape from Extinction:Rewildingis in UK cinemas from 22 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsConservationRewildingMeryl StreepreviewsShareReuse this content"

In real life, the dangers seem more prosaic: being treated as an expendable asset and dumped. That was the situation for Muslim Kosovan refugee Blerim Skoro who, despite years spent protecting US national security as a prison informant and al-Qaida mole, was threatened with deportation. His paymasters, theCIAand FBI, don’t emerge creditably from director Anthony Wonke’s headlong, if narrowly focused, account.Skoro seems to have a gift for being in the right or wrong place at the wrong or right time; it’s not obvious which. After deserting from the army during the 1990s Yugoslav war, he wound up as an asylum seeker in New York with a young family. But a new hustle, running drugs for the Albanian mafia, backfires when he is picked up at customs. In his Manhattan prison, he has a direct view of the twin towers on 9/11; in the aftermath, the CIA recruits Skoro – already in the orbit of the Islamist contingent, thanks to his military bona fides and Qur’anic learning – as an inside man in the “war on terror”.Simultaneously naive and durable, Skoro comes across like a post-9/11 Zelig adapting to turbulent geopolitical terrain. The same cheerful malleability that saw him thrive as an immigrant and foolishly take the Albanian gig allows him to ingratiate himself in the upper-middle echelons of al-Qaida, where he becomes a key Balkans liaison. But there’s something jejune or hollow about his repeated insistence he was a willing participant because he hates bad people. More understandable is the simple explanation: the hope of getting a green card to rejoin his family in New York.Though Wonke energetically depicts this extraordinary character, the film doesn’t broaden to contextualise him in the wider anti-terrorist infrastructure. Nor is it completely clear what information he contributed to it or operations he supported – though possibly disclosing specifics on camera would have been pushing his luck. One point The Accidental Spy does conspicuously flag up is the cynicism of the security agency towards their field operatives. Perhaps vulnerable foreigners suffer it more than native Americans, but you suspect this exploitation won’t improve under Trump.The Accidental Spy is atBertha DocHouse, London from 25 AprilExplore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsAl-QaidaCIAEspionageRefugeesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Some of the things he buys are fake designer items, which he markets as genuine. But some are perfectly legal: collectible action figures and the like which are advertised entirely honestly. At the beginning we see him ruthlessly buying “therapy devices” from a medical business that has gone bust and then exploitatively putting them up for sale. (But wait. Even if we believe in these therapy devices, why doesn’t the embattled business itself just sell them online? It’s not explained.)Flush with cash, Ryôsuke moves to a place in the country to pursue his business with more space for his dodgy goods and his girlfriend moves there with him. But then the people he’s defrauded band together in some kind of unlikely enraged gang to get payback, all of them apparently with casual access to weaponry. Ryôsuke’s own assistant turns out to be pretty much gun crazy.And so all the hi-tech detail and low-key everyday believability of the story is jettisoned in favour of an entirely ridiculous shootout in a deserted factory, with many deafening bullet ricochets off metal fittings. The final half-hour seems to be a neo-western style melee which seems to go on for ever. Odd … and unrewarding.Cloud is in UK cinemas from 25 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersDrama filmsCrime filmsInternetJapanAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

The film opens with lovingly recorded home videos of various gatherings, including her childhood birthday celebrations, the only time of the year when her paternal grandmother, Nelly, would visit. A formidable woman of Roma ancestry, Nelly came from a long line of skilled circus performers, an illustrious ancestry that ended when Faya’s father did not join the family business.One particular aspect long eluded Faya: Nelly was always seen with woman called Neirud, whom Faya called aunt, but their actual relationship was a mystery; when Neirud died, her house was emptied of all personal photos and keepsakes. Through meticulous research, Faya gradually uncovered Neirud’s story. A Black woman of towering build, she performed as a wrestler in Nelly’s circus troupe as the “gorilla woman”, a moniker that clearly traded in racial stereotypes. And yet, as with many of her peers, life as a travelling entertainer gave her a degree of freedom not afforded to other women of the time.This paradox is not the only puzzle that unravels in the documentary. Faya came to discover other clues that reveal not only the nature of the bond between her grandmother and Neirud but also the complex racial fabric of Brazil itself. The interweaving of digital videotapes and archival footage is rich with an edgy visual texture that echoes the thorniness of Neirud’s identity, one that eschews simplistic societal binaries. Though beginning in a place of uncertainty, Faya’s film impresses as a homage not only to a larger-than-life figure, but also to the beauty of alternative family models.Neirud is on True Story from 25 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsBrazilRaceRoma, Gypsies and TravellersAmericasFamilyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Having his card declined at a McDonald’s drive thru just weeks before this year’sMelbourneinternational comedy festival was a watershed moment for him. He is 41. He’s been performing comedy for more than a decade. This, he says, is his last festival show. He’s done.Geggy is his swan song, a chaotic journey through his career’s highs and lows and the decisions that led him to that drive thru. For those who have followed Larsen’s career, this show is a treat, offering a hilarious insight into the chaos behind the scenes of the various projects he’s been involved in. It includes a cast of others who rose through the circuit with him, many of whom are doing pretty well for themselves, including Larsen’s early collaborator Sam Campbell.Lou Wall: Breaking the Fifth Wall review – a silly and profound standup masterpieceRead moreThe show is a window into the reality of working as a comedian, from open mic gigs in pokie-filled pubs to glitzy award nights and the various day jobs that happen in between. It isn’t a glamorous story – Centrelink payments are a recurring thread as Larsen struggles to make ends meet. The theme of the show, if there is one, is money. And the question of why Larsen doesn’t have any.Larsen has been nominated for and won multiple awards in his career, including multiple prizes at the MICF. In fact, Geggy has been nominated for the festival’s coveted honour for best show. And, while he is clearly pleased to be nominated, there is little sense that it will change anything. Larsen has had various successes – prestigious awards, a starring role in an international TV show, high-paying corporate gigs – but after every high comes the fall, and Larsen ends up broke again.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningGeggy is an insight into how critically underfunded the arts industry is in Australia. Larsen talks about his various TV gigs with bitterness – not because they weren’t rewarding but because of how infrequently the pay cheques matched the hours worked. It’s something anyone who’s worked in the arts or entertainment industries in Australia will be familiar with, cobbling together jobs to try to equal one rent payment.While he takes aim at landlords and corporate executives for their role in this cycle of hardship, he does not let himself off scot free. He admits his brain is “full of piss” and attributes a portion of his financial situation to his own poor decision-making.It’s an important reminder that, for the majority of comics, staging a festival show is a loss-making venture. Larsen is not the first to paint MICF as a slightly masochistic pursuit. But underneath this is a passion for making people laugh and glimpses into the chaotic, joyful moments that come from doing that with a community of others.Despite beginning the show saying he doesn’t have time to build a rapport, there’s something about Larsen’s sweary, staggering demeanour that quickly gets the audience on side. The show is an almost relentless barrage of jokes, with little pause for breath. This pace doesn’t even slow for the darker portions of the story, including multiple periods of suicidal thoughts, but Larsen narrates his life with a baffled derision that is both self-deprecating and nostalgic.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This could easily have resulted in something messy and self-indulgent but instead it feels honest.And even though he insists Geggy is his last show, it feels as though Larsen still has things to say. From biting thoughts on socialism to ruthless take-downs of his early work, he is at his best when he allows the cracks to show and embraces the rough edges. If this is his final show, he’s going out with a bang. And if it isn’t, let’s hope he at least makes some money off the next one.Greg Larsen is performing Geggy atSydney comedy festival on 25 AprilExplore more on these topicsComedyMelbourneSydneyreviewsShareReuse this content"

The younger son of one-time Lord Chancellor Sir Michael Havers, Havers Jr opted against Eton, moving into theatre, radio and briefly training as a wine merchant, before finding fame as the lead of the 1977 BBC adaptation of Nicholas Nickleby, and opposite Bob Hoskins in 1978 Dennis Potter BBC musical drama, Pennies from Heaven.By the time he was cast in 1981’s Chariots of Fire, Havers was a familiar face on British television. Here, he got to play his first lord – Cambridge student Lord Andrew Lindsay – and run, barefooted and in slow motion, across West Sands beach in St Andrews, earning him a Bafta nomination in the process. Roles soon followed as the public school-educated but class-conscious Ronnie Heaslop in 1984 epic period drama A Passage to India, and as father figure Dr Rawlins in Steven Spielberg’s 1987 war film Empire of the Sun. He also plays David Niven in 2004’s The Life and Death of Peter Sellers.Havers has spent the most recent part of his career on television, continuing the well-educated/peerage theme. His roles as lords (we count four) include Lord Hepworth in Downton Abbey and his portrayal of the beaten-down-by-the-bad-guys Lord Whitecroft in Guy Ritchie’s 2024 Netflix series, The Gentleman – one of his most “is it Nigel or is he acting?” parts to date. As doctors (we count five), he most famously played Dr Tom Latimer in all six series of the 80s BBC sitcom Don’t Wait Up, and as Dr Jonathan Paige in ITV medical drama, Dangerfield. This February, he played his own grandfather, Sir Cecil Havers QC, in ITV drama A Cruel Love: The Ruth Ellis Story. He was gentleman escort Lewis Archer in Coronation Street for a decade. And you might also have caught him on stage in Art and Noel Coward comedy Private Lives, and in panto in Dick Whittington, Aladdin,Jack and The Beanstalkor more.With a penchant for everything from the gee-gees to the ladies to, erm,going to the tip on a Sunday, there’s plenty to ask Havers as he sits for the Guardian reader interview. He’s certainly in the mood to chat, as he’s currently halfway through his first ever live tour – Nigel Havers Talking Bollocks – where he promises to … well, the clue seems to be in the title. But is he really Too Posh to be Privileged, likethose advertshe did in the 2000s?Having played so many lords and sirs, is he disappointed he hasn’t been made one himself yet? Does he have Chariots of Fire in his headphones when he goes for a jog? And who was his favourite co-barger in Celebrity Carry On Barging – Simon Callow, Lorraine Chase or Debbie McGee? Find out by getting your questions in by 6pm Tuesday 22 April and reading his answers online and in Film&Music on Friday 25 April.Nigel Havers Talking Bollocksis at Harrogate Royal Hall 25 April, Liverpool Playhouse 26 April, and Shrewsbury theatre Severn 21 MayExplore more on these topicsNigel HaversThe reader interviewTelevisionShareReuse this content"

Positioned directly overlooking the quieter end of Bournemouth’s long, sandy beach, the miniature seaside boltholes combine white clapboard walls and nautical stripes with mod cons such as a kitchen, toilet, shower room and wifi. Guests can also take advantage of free travel on the land train, which runs down to the pier and aquarium.Lodges sleep up to four adults and two children (apart from the accessible lodge, which accommodates up to four adults and one child), from £500 for three nights,bournemouthbeachlodges.co.uk.All accommodation prices are based on a May 2025 stay.No. 124, Brighton, East SussexView image in fullscreenOpened at the end of 2024, No. 124 Brighton is the latest boutique stay from GuestHouseHotels.

Thought to have been built as a dovecot in the late 1800s, the building was recently renovated by the National Trust to offer a peaceful self-catering retreat in this nationally important nature reserve. Although there is hot water, the only source of heating is a wood-burning stove and there is limited electricity.Keep an eye out for red squirrels and sika deer in the forest and, after the boats and day visitors have left, head to the beach for some stargazing.

You can hire kayaks and paddleboards and explore the estuary without having to get into your car, and the friendlyFerry Boat Inn, which serves local seafood, is just next door.

The islands can be expensive, but this family-run B&B, which overlooks sandy Porthcressa beach, is relatively well priced (for Scilly at least), even in summer. From the coast path just outside the B&B you can explore the island on foot. You can also head to the ferry quay and hop on a boat to nearby Tresco and the famous Abbey Gardens.

Protected from the wind, the sandy bay is great for paddleboarding and kayaking. A revamped £3m seaside spa, which includes a sauna, steam room and outdoor hydro pool, will open this summer.

Hake is my new go-to white fish: it’s sustainable, it has a lovely texture, it roasts beautifully and it’s the perfect foil for a spicy topping. My sambal pays homage to the Indonesian versions made with tomatoes and chilli – it starts off as a light, fresh sauce that cooks down beautifully with the fish and tomatoes.Roast hake with tomato and chilli sambalFor ease, I use a high-speed blender to make the sambal.Prep15 minCook25 minServes2300g cherry vine tomatoes, halved4 echalion shallots, peeled and quartered1tbsp neutral oil1tsp sea salt flakes2 thick hake fillets(about 160g each)30g salted peanuts,roughly chopped5g chives, finely slicedHot white rice, to serveFor the sambal2 largelong red chillies, likereallylarge ones, deseeded60g cherry vine tomatoes½ lemongrass stick, roughly chopped2echalionshallots, peeled2garlic cloves1tsp sea salt flakes, plus extra to serve20ml neutral oil1tbsp palm sugar, or dark brown sugar½ lime, juiced, plus extra to serveHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7.

Take the roasting tin out of the oven, make two wells in the tomato mixture with the back of a spoon, then place a hake fillet in each of them. Spread a good two to three tablespoons of the sambal over the fish, then stir the rest into the tomatoes and shallots. Return the tin to the oven until the fish is just cooked through – 18 minutes for very thick fillets, 15 minutes for thinner ones – then taste and add a little more salt or lime juice, if you wish.Scatter the salted peanuts and chives all over the top, then serve with hot white rice.The Guardian aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

They belonged to thelate cook and teacher Carla Tomasi, who wanted them to be useful, so gave them to theLatteria cooking studio. However, until the studio has more shelves, I have 15 of Carla’s 60 books sitting by my desk. They are a well-loved pile, but five in particular stand out as having been used and used. The first isDan Lepard’s Short and Sweet, which, thanks to grey duct tape, is just about holding together, and the second isThane Prince’s Perfect Preserves, also duct-taped. The third is a 1985 edition ofClaudia Roden’s A Book of Middle Eastern Food, the fourthElisabeth Luard’s 1991 The Flavours of Andalusiaand the fifthAnna del Conte’s 1987 Gastronomy of Italy, all of which are missing at least one cover, have loose pages and bite marks (dogs?), are covered in brown paper and have their titles written on them with marker pen.As anyone who worked with or was taught by Carla will know, she was a cooking snowball: always gathering. Also, that she was immensely generous in her acknowledgements, carefully noting the place, book or person from whom she had gathered it. Del Conte, in particular, was someone who came up constantly, and Carla referred to Gastronomy of Italy, which she bought a few years after arriving in London, as a life-changing book that taught her about the country she had left.I have been imagining myself as 35-year-old Carla, sitting at her kitchen table just off Tottenham Court Road, making notes on the map at the beginning of the book. Later, when Carla was giving lessons upstairs atBooks for Cooks, she would meet Anna. Years after that, Carla and I would make Anna’s fennel with pistachio, lemon and anchovy sauce for a class at Latteria Studio. Anna had learned the recipe from the 18th-century writer Vincenzo Corrado, to whom she refers as one of her favourite cookery writers and notes that the dish “leaves you delighted yet puzzled as to how such an unlikely combination of flavours could blend with such complete harmony”. Carla agreed – and I did, too – and here is the recipe.Corrado’s concise recipe includes no mention of resting, or indeed any serving suggestions, for that matter, but he was writing in 1773 and for experienced cooks preparing extravagant, carefully controlled feasts. Del Conte, on the other hand, writing in 1986, suggests covering and resting the dish in the fridge for 24 hours, then bringing it back to room temperature before serving.I took the opportunity to taste at various stages and two stood out: about an hour after mixing, when the dressing has started to sink in but the lemon is still fresh; and after 24 hours, by which time the dressing and fennel are inseparable and the dish sits halfway between a dressed vegetable and a relish. Complete harmony served with a few crushed pistachios, more olive oil and the reserved fennel fronds, plus roast chicken, grilled fish, pork chops or hard-boiled eggs.Anna del Conte and Vincenzo Corrado’s fennel with pistachio, lemon and anchovy sauceServes43-4fennel bulbs(about 700g in total)300ml dry white wine2 bay leaves2½cm cinnamon stick8 whole peppercorns30g pistachios, skin rubbed away as much as possible, plus extra to finish3 anchovy fillets1 tsp sugar4 tbsp olive oil,plus extra to serve2 tsp white-wine vinegar2-4 tbsp lemon juice, plus finely grated lemon zest to tasteTrim the fennel and remove and discard the outer layer if bruised or particularly thick; save any frilly fronds. Cut the bulbs first into quarters and then into slim wedges (don’t worry if they fall apart a bit).Put the wine, bay leaves, cinnamon and peppercorns in a pan, add the fennel and enough water just to cover the fennel, then bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for about eight minutes, until the fennel is just tender. Drain and put the fennel in a shallow dish.For the sauce, and working in either a mortar or food processor, grind or blend the pistachios, anchovy, sugar, olive oil and white-wine vinegar to a thick paste. Add the lemon juice, tasting as you go, and the lemon zest to your liking. Pour the dressing over the fennel, toss well, then rest for 20 minutes to 24 hours (for anything over two hours, cover and keep in fridge).Before serving, let the dish return to room temperature, then finish with a few crushed pistachios, a bit more olive oil and the reserved fennel fronds, if you like.Explore more on these topicsItalian food and drinkA kitchen in RomeFoodVegetablesSide dishesFishSeafoodNuts and seedsrecipesShareReuse this content"
