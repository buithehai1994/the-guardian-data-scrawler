The campus and local schools where students had been in lockdown had been safely evacuated, he said.All six hospitalised people are adults, local authorities said. Five of them had gunshot wounds, one of whom has minor injuries.Jonas Claesson, director of health and medical services in the Örebro region, said one of the patients was in a life-threatening condition.Police said they had opened an investigation into murder, arson and an aggravated weapons offence.Sweden shooting: 10 people dead after attack at education centre in Örebro, say police – latest updatesRead moreThe prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, described the attack in the city, which is about 125 miles (200km) west of Stockholm, as a “terrible act of violence” on a “very painful day for all of Sweden”.He said the government was in close contact with police and the operation was continuing.“My thoughts are [also] with all of those whose normal school day was turned into fear. Being locked up in a classroom fearing for your life is a nightmare no one should have to experience.”Police should be allowed “the peace of mind they need to investigate what happened and how these horrific crimes could have occurred”, Kristersson said.“This is the worst mass shooting in Swedish history,” he told reporters, as he urged people not to speculate about the motive.King Carl XVI Gustaf conveyed his condolences. “It is with deep sadness and dismay that my family and I received the news about the terrible atrocity in Örebro,” he said.Map locating the area of Sweden where the shooting took placeMap locating the area of Sweden where the shooting took placeForest gave no further information about the injured. “The reason we cannot be more specific at this time is that the damage outcome is so great,” he said. Police had earlier said four people had had surgery and one was in a serious condition.Forest told an earlier media conference police had no indication of motive. “When it comes to saying anything more about the perpetrator, it is still very early,” he said. “The operation is ongoing and that will undoubtedly become clearer.”View image in fullscreenPolice at the scene of the incident in Örebro.Photograph: Kicki Nilsson/APCampus Risbergska, where the shooting occurred, serves students mainly over the age of 20. It also offers primary and upper secondary school courses as well as classes in Swedish for immigrants, vocational training and programmes for people with disabilities.One teacher, Lena Warenmark, told the broadcaster SVT she had been confined to her study after hearing “gunshots very close”.She said she heard “probably 10 shots” in total, with a short pause between two bursts. She said there had been an unusually small number of students on campus as many had gone home after sitting an exam.Johannes Sjöberg, whose daughter is a student at the campus, told SVT he had been in touch by text message with her throughout after she had arrived at the school about five minutes before the shooting started.“She saw blood and the teachers were good at helping them, bringing them in and locking the door,” Sjöberg said. He said his daughter was safe and was providing information to the police.View image in fullscreenPolice special forces at the scene.Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty ImagesAndreas Sundling, 28, was among those who barricaded themselves inside the campus. “We heard three bangs and loud screams,” he told the Expressen newspaper.All those who took shelter were evacuated by mid-afternoon, police said.Maria Pegado, 54, a teacher at the school, said someone had thrown open the door to her classroom just after lunchbreak and shouted to everyone to get out.“I took all my 15 students out into the hallway and we started running,” she told Reuters. “Then I heard two shots but we made it out. We were close to the school entrance. I saw people dragging injured out, first one, then another. I realised it was very serious.”School attacks are rare in Sweden but several serious incidents have taken place in recent years.

He was 88.His Aga Khan Foundation and the Ismaili religious community announced on their websites that His Highness Prince Karim al-Hussaini, the Aga Khan IV and 49th hereditary imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims, died on Tuesday in Portugal surrounded by his family.They said an announcement on his successor would come later.Considered by his followers to be a direct descendant of the prophet Muhammad, the Aga Khan was a student when his grandfather passed over his playboy father as his successor to lead the diaspora of Shia Ismaili Muslims, saying his followers should be led by a young man “who has been brought up in the midst of the new age”.Over decades, the Aga Khan evolved into a business magnate and philanthropist, moving between the spiritual and the worldly and mixing them with ease.Treated as a head of state, the Aga Khan was given the title of “His Highness” by Queen Elizabeth in July 1957, two weeks after his grandfather the Aga Khan III unexpectedly made him heir to the family’s 1,300-year dynasty as leader of the Ismaili Muslim sect.He became the Aga Khan IV on 19 October 1957, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on the spot where his grandfather once had his weight equalled in diamonds in gifts from his followers.He had left Harvard to be at his ailing grandfather’s side, and returned to thee US university 18 months later with an entourage and a deep sense of responsibility.“I was an undergraduate who knew what his work for the rest of his life was going to be,” he said in a 2012 interview with Vanity Fair magazine. “I don’t think anyone in my situation would have been prepared.”A defender of Islamic culture and values, he was widely regarded as a builder of bridges between Muslim societies and the west despite – or perhaps because of – his reticence to become involved in politics.The Aga Khan Development Network, his main philanthropic organisation, dealt mainly with issues of healthcare, housing, education and rural economic development.A network of hospitals bearing his name are scattered in countries where health care had been lacking for the poorest, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Tajikistan, where he spent tens of millions of dollars for development of local economies.His eye for building and design led him to establish an architecture prize and programmes for Islamic architecture at MIT and Harvard. He restored ancient Islamic structures throughout the world.Aga Khan Museum: North America finally gets a home for Islamic artRead moreAccounts differ as to the date and place of his birth. According to Who’s Who in France, he was born on 13 December 1936, in Creux-de-Genthod, near Geneva, Switzerland, the son of Joan Yarde-Buller and Aly Khan.The extent of the Aga Khan’s financial empire is hard to measure. Some reports estimated his personal wealth to be in the billions.The Ismailis – a sect originally centred in India but which expanded to large communities in east Africa, central and south Asia and the Middle East – consider it a duty to tithe up to 10% of their income to him as steward.“We have no notion of the accumulation of wealth being evil,” he told Vanity Fair in 2012.“The Islamic ethic is that if God has given you the capacity or good fortune to be a privileged individual in society, you have a moral responsibility to society.”He is survived by three sons and a daughter.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsIslamReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

I don’t know if or how her own mental health was assessed. But the day after, her messages were quite distressed. And two days later, she took her own life.”Kyrke-Smith said she hoped that, after the debate, she could examine whether there were any improvements that could be made to the mental health bill, which is now in the House of Lords. Suicide is the leading cause of maternal death in the period from six weeks to a year after birth.Kyrke-Smith said that her surprise election victory – her majority is 630 – had made her determined to make an impact on the subject.“Since losing Sophie, I have become aware of how prevalent maternal mental health challenges are, but how little attention they get compared with the physical challenges of pregnancy, birth and that first year after birth,” she said.“I knew that I wanted to change this if I was elected to parliament. I want to do right by Sophie and I want to make sure that other women get the support they need and deserve.”Kyrke-Smith will say in her speech that improvements have been made in recent years, including an increase in specialist perinatal mental health services for women with the most severe and complex issues across England. But, she said, care remained “a postcode lottery” with disadvantaged women more likely to miss out.“I wonder if any healthcare professionals asked Sophie not just how the baby was, but how she was,” Kyrke-Smith will say in her speech.“I wonder if the discussions about her baby’s feeding were had in a way that sought to reduce her anxiety.“I wonder if she was given less attention because this was her third child, and her earlier experiences had been smoother – I certainly experienced less attention with my own third child. I will never know.”The MP said she was calling for aprotection of specialist maternal care in severe cases as part of theNHSfive-year plan on mental health, and better integration of mental health care into all routine contact during pregnancy and after birth, with mental health prioritised in the same way as physical health.She will say there should be a renewed focus on community support, saying she believed that the Covid-19 pandemic contributed to her friend’s feeling of isolation, and that there should be a mission to help friends and families build awareness to help mothers who are struggling.“Did I worry about her being depressed? Yes. Did I worry about suicidal thoughts? Honestly, yes. Did I think she might take her own life? No. I have struggled with the guilt that I didn’t somehow do something to stop it. But I also recognise now how ignorant I was.”The care minister, Stephen Kinnock, was expected to respond to the debate, which Kyrke-Smith said was oversubscribed with MPs hoping to speak.Kyrke-Smith is being supported by the Alliance for Maternal MentalHealth. “Too often, mental health support is seen as an added luxury rather than an integral part of maternity care. This must change,” campaigns head, Karen Middleton, said. “Maternal mental health problems are treatable, and the right support can be life-changing, even life-saving.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

The president established a ‘department of government efficiency’ on the same day.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/APTrump administrationHow the world’s richest man laid waste to the US governmentElon Musk has achieved astonishing power in Trump’s administration – and spent the weekend wielding itNick Robins-EarlyTue 4 Feb 2025 14.52 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2025 17.10 ESTShareSince declaring his support forDonald Trumpin July of last year and subsequently spending more than $250m on his re-election effort,Elon Muskhas rapidly accumulated political influence and positioned himself at the heart of the new administration. Now as prominent as the president himself, Musk has begun to make use of that power, making decisions that could affect the health of millions of people, gaining access to highly sensitive personal data, and attacking anyone who opposes him. Musk, the world’s richest man and an unelected official, has achieved an astonishing level of power over the federal government.Over the weekend, workers with Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) clashed with civil servants over demands for unfettered access to thecomputer systemsof major US government agencies in a breakneck series of confrontations. When the dust settled, several top officials who opposed the takeover had been pushed out, and Musk’s allies had gained control.Musk, with the backing of Trump, is now working to shut down theUS Agency for International Development(USAid) – the world’s largest single supplier of humanitarian aid. He bragged on Sunday about “feeding USAid into the wood chipper”. He has also targeted several other agencies in an aggressive attempt to purge and remake the federal government along ideological lines, while avoiding congressional or judicial oversight.Many of Musk’s actions have taken place without forewarning or transparency, sowing chaos and confusion among the thousands of people employed at the agencies like USAid that he has gone after. Humanitarian organizations that rely on US funding havehalted operationsand laid off staff, while government workers have been locked out of their offices. He is operating Doge as an unofficial government department with no congressionally approved mandate while he technicallyholds the positionof “special government employee”, which allows him tosidestep financial disclosuresand a public vetting process.View image in fullscreenAn employee of USAid protests outside the headquarters on Monday in Washington.Photograph: Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesMusk has gleefully posted on X, the social media platform that he owns, throughout the chaos. He has accused USAid of corruption, and of being a “criminal organization” and “radical-left political psy op”, without any evidence. Why? He tweeted an explanation of simply doing Trump’s bidding: “All @DOGE did was check to see which federal organizations were violating the @POTUS executive orders the most. Turned out to be USAID, so that became our focus.” He said it was “time for it to die”.Musk also suggested that opposition to his team will be punished, reposting a letter sent to him from the Trump-appointed federal prosecutor for Washington DC, who vowed to “pursue any and all legal action against anyone who impedes your work or threatens your people”.‘It’s been madness’: US federal workers reeling over Trump-Musk takeoverRead moreThe New York Democratic senator Chuck Schumer wrote on Tuesday morning: “An unelected shadow government is conducting a hostile takeover of the federal government. DOGE is not a real government agency. DOGE has no authority to shut programs down or to ignore federal law.” Musk responded that the reaction was “hysterical”.As other Democrats and government oversight groups began to respond to the breakneck series of actions from Musk’s team, on Tuesday the Tesla and SpaceX CEO continued to plow ahead with his cuts and told his supporters: “We’re never going to get another chance like this.”Musk takes over federal agenciesImmediately following Trump’s inauguration on 20 January, the president issued an executive order establishing Musk’s “department of government efficiency”. Rather than create an entirely new entity, the order renamed the US Digital Service, which was previously tasked with updating government IT systems, and brought the rechristened bureau into the executive office of the president.Government accountability groups instantly saw red flags with its creation, filingfour separate lawsuitsthat alleged Doge violated federal transparency laws while warning that the initiative was “slated to dictate federal policy in ways that will affect millions of Americans”.The concerns from watchdog organizations have borne out. Musk and employees of Doge have gained access to sensitive government systems in the treasury department and USAid in recent days, as well as exerted control over the office of personnel management (OPM) and theGeneral Services Administration, which handles federal real estate, with the goal of ending office leases. Two federal workers additionally sued on Tuesday for a temporary restraining order against Doge for allegedly operating an illegal server in OPM.View image in fullscreenProtesters gather outside of the office of personnel management headquarters in Washington DC on Monday.Photograph: Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesAttempts at blocking Musk’s team have resulted in several top agency officials being ousted. On Friday, the treasury department’s acting secretary, David Lebryk, resigned after refusing to grant Musk’s team access tohighly secure systemsthat control about $6tn in annual payments to millions of Americans. The next day, two senior security officials at USAid attempted tostop Doge workersfrom gaining physical access to restricted areas at the agency – resulting in a standoff in which a deputy for Musk threatened to call the US marshals. Both security officials have subsequently been put on administrative leave, and on Sunday night staff at USAid received emails telling them to not come into work the next day.The events unfolded swiftly and took place mostly outside of working hours, creating uncertainty over the weekend as to who was in charge and what authority the Doge team possessed. Many of the Doge team tasked with carrying out the overhauls of government agencies appear to have little to no experience in government and are extremely young. One of the engineers is as young as 19,Wiredreported, while a 25-year-old who previously worked at two of Musk’s companies gained access to treasury department payment systems.TheTrump administrationhas maintained that all Musk’s actions have been legal and did not violate security protocols, although the details of what Doge employees are doing with access to government systems is still unclear. “No classified material was accessed without proper security clearances,” Katie Miller, a Doge spokesperson and wife of the far-right Trump administration official Stephen Miller, wrote on X.Musk has claimed that his actions are cutting unnecessary costs and will allow for more efficient government, but he has also suggested his taskforce is ideologically opposed to liberal initiatives such as refugee services and the promotion of trans rights. He has routinely engaged with far-right and conspiracy theory-promoting accounts on X while touting his dismantling of USAid, an agency that has become a target in recent years among hardline conservatives. The far-right Heritage Foundation thinktank specifically called for reforming USAid in itscontroversial Project 2025 report, accusing it of spreading “climate extremism” and “gender radicalism”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As backlash swelled and Democrats issued calls for action against Musk on Monday, Trump attempted to assuage some of the concerns and reassert that he was in charge.“Elon can’t do and won’t do anything without our approval,” Trump said in the Oval Office. “We’ll give him approval where appropriate and where not appropriate we won’t.”But there have been no public signs thus far that Trump has reined in Musk’s ambitions or prevented him from engaging in potential conflicts –he has many, as a number of his companies do extensive work with government agencies he now holds sway over. Several of Trump’s recent policy announcements also appeared to align with Musk’s worldview and personal grievances.View image in fullscreenElon Musk and Donald Trump at a rally before the inauguration.Photograph: Alex Brandon/APTrump declared on Monday that he would shut down all aid to South Africa,Musk’s country of birth, over what he alleged was a “massive human rights violation” in the form ofa new land rights law. Musk has repeatedly accused the South African government of racism against white people and falsely claimed that the government is allowing a “genocide” against white farmers.Anotherexecutive orderfrom Trump on 31 January vowed to “unleash prosperity through deregulation” and declared that whenever a government agency issues a new regulation it must first remove 10 existing regulations. The order has echoed Musk’s longstanding calls for widespread deregulation of the federal government, which Musk reiterated in a livestream on Monday night on X,when he stated“regulations, basically, should be default gone”. He described the current administration as “our best shot” at this deregulation and “the best hand of cards we’re ever going to have”.Musk has made sweeping and aggressive declarations about what else must change about the US government, indicating where he might strike next. He stated on Monday: “Activist judges must be removed from the bench or there is no justice,” and praised the representative Marjorie Taylor Greene forissuing calls for NPR and PBSto testify at a hearing about their operations. Greene, who is head of a “delivering on government efficiency” group within the House oversight committee that aims to support Musk’s efforts, accused the public media organizations of ideological bias – citing a PBS report that Musk “gave what appeared to be a fascist salute” during a speech last month.It is uncertain what mechanisms may prevent further cuts by Musk. His immense influence coupled with his erratic behavior have made it difficult to quickly ascertain where the next axe may fall, such as on Monday when Muskclaimed that a government agencythat worked on a free IRS tax filing system was “deleted” while giving no further information. The agency’s program was still online as of Tuesday.What is clear from Musk’s public statements is the intent to barrel ahead with accumulating more power over government agencies, while framing his crusade as an existential fight for the future of the country.“It’s now or never,” the billionaire tweeted on Tuesday. “Your support is crucial to the success of the revolution of the people.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationElon MuskUS politicsDonald TrumpUS domestic policynewsShareReuse this content"

She is serving 15 life sentences for murdering seven babies and attempting to murder seven others.The panel members, who rank among the most senior experts in the world, include Neena Modi, a professor of neonatal medicine at Imperial College London; Mikael Norman, a senior physician at the Karolinska Institute and founder of the International Society of Evidence-based Neonatology; and Ann Stark, professor in residence of paediatrics at Harvard medical school.Case notes for each baby were examined by two experts independently, who then passed their reports to the chair. If their opinions differed, a third member of the panel reviewed the case anda consensus view was reached. The panel worked under the agreement that their findings would be released whether they favoured Letby or not.Baby oneThe baby boy was alleged to have died after air was injected through a catheter into a vein, causing an air embolism – an air bubble that blocks a blood vessel – which in turn led to collapse, discoloration of the skin and death.The expert panel found no evidence of air embolism and attributed the baby’s death to thrombosis.Baby fourThe baby girl was alleged to have died from the same cause as baby one, namely an injection of air into an intravenous line, leading to an air embolism that resulted in collapse, patchy discoloration of the skin and death.The panel concluded that baby four had died from systemic sepsis, pneumonia and disseminated intravascular coagulation, where blood clots form throughout the circulatory system. The mother should have received antibiotics in pregnancy, the panel said. When the child was born there was a delay in recognising that she was in respiratory distress and in starting antibiotics and further treatment. There was no evidence of air embolism.Baby sixThe court heard that baby six had died after being given synthetic insulin through an infusion bag.The experts found that the boy had prolonged hypoglycaemia, or low blood sugar, because of sepsis, premature birth and borderline poor growth in the womb. He received poor medical care for hypoglycaemia.Baby sevenThe baby girl was alleged to have died after being deliberately overfed and having air injected into her stomach through a nasogastric tube, causing vomiting and clinical deterioration.On reviewing her medical notes, the panel concluded that her vomiting was due to an infection, possibly enterovirus. They found no evidence to suggest air was injected into the stomach or that the child was overfed.Baby nineThe court was told that the baby girl had died after having air injected into her stomach via a nasogastric tube, leading to recurrent swelling of the abdomen, diaphragmatic “splinting”, which impairs movement of the diaphragm in breathing, and respiratory arrest. It was alleged that an apnoea alarm, which can detect when babies stop breathing, was deliberately turned off, meaning the response to the baby’s collapse was delayed. It was later alleged that air was injected into intravenous tubing, causing air embolism and death.The panel found that baby nine had died from respiratory complications caused by respiratory distress syndrome and chronic lung disease, complicated by infection withStenotrophomonas maltophilia, a multidrug-resistant bacterium. Doctors caring for her failed to respond to surveillance warnings about the infection, did not recognise the diagnosis, and did not treat her with appropriate antibiotics. The experts found no evidence of air embolism or of air causing diaphragmatic splinting. Further evidence suggested the apnoea alarm may not have been switched off. “This was likely a preventable death,” the report notes.Baby 11The court heard that the baby girl had first deteriorated after an endotracheal tube, a flexible plastic tube inserted into the windpipe, was deliberately dislodged. The consultant alleged that the alarms on the baby’s incubator were deliberately turned off to prevent a prompt rescue because he did not hear the alarms when he entered the room.The panel found no evidence that the endotracheal tube had been dislodged. The reason the girl’s condition deteriorated was that the tube used was too small. The initial placing of the tube was “traumatic and poorly supervised” the report claims. It adds that the consultant did not understand the basics of resuscitation, air leaks, mechanical ventilation, and how equipment commonly used on the unit worked. There was also evidence that the incubator alarms were not turned off.Baby 15The court initially heard that the boy, a triplet, had suffered blunt trauma to the abdomen, causing purpling of the skin and bleeding on the liver. Air was allegedly injected into the nasogastric tube causing the intestines to swell. Later, the accusation was changed to deliberate injection of air into the boy’s bloodstream.The expert panel said the boy had died from a subcapsular liver haematoma, or bleeding beneath the outer layer of the liver, caused by traumatic delivery. This resulted in haemorrhage into the surrounding abdomen and profound shock. This was not recognised before the child died.In summarising their findings, the panel flagged more than a dozen problems that were likely to have contributed to the babies’ deaths. These ranged from failures in diagnosing disease, poor skills in basic medical procedures such as inserting chest tubes, poor management of common neonatal conditions like low blood sugar and a disregard for warnings about infections.“There was no medical evidence to support malfeasance causing death or injury in any of the 17 cases in the trial,” the report concludes. “Death or injury of affected infants were due to natural causes or errors in medical care.”Explore more on these topicsLucy LetbyChesterHospitalsEnglandexplainersShareReuse this content"

Totalitarianism’s propensity for being tedious as well as grotesque is captured rather too well by the director Joe Wright’s lavish, stagey Mussolini: Son of the Century, an eight-part dramatisation of Antonio Scurati’s prize-winning book. It’s quite a spectacle, but it doesn’t half go on.Luca Marinelli is magnificently disgusting asBenito Mussolini, who founds the Italian Fasces of Combat – a gang of thugs bent on beating up socialists and channelling the fury of neglected first world war veterans – in 1919. Six years later, which in this drama is the best part of six episodes, he has established himself as Italy’s fascist dictator, in a way that will give his European neighbours some pointers on the obstacles to power that must be overcome.In episode one, Mussolini lists most of those obstacles when he outlines what fascism stands against: the church, the monarchy, the Italian state as it was then and the concept of elections are all, he says, brakes on the strong government his country needs.But his biggest pain comes from socialists, who refuse to go away no matter how many times Mussolini’s goons cosh them in restaurants or set fire to their offices. Marinelli skilfully portrays a man who is in essence a ridiculous loser, dogged by self‑doubt and only ever one bad piece of oratory away from losing the faith of his followers, but who slowly grows in stature as, through sheer persistence and the fecklessness of his opponents, he endures.It is a long grind and here, unfortunately, it feels like one. If Mussolini is not giving a speech from the stage, he is doling one out one-to-one to an acolyte or adversary; if he can’t do that, he picks on us instead and orates directly to camera. Political schemers are well suited to breaking the fourth wall, and Mussolini here gives us some good sly asides, but Wright takes the idea of moving beyond regular drama an awful lot further.View image in fullscreenBristling with intrigue … Barbara Chichiarelli as Mussolini’s mistress, muse and mentor Margherita Sarfatti.Photograph: Andrea PirrelloThis Mussolini introduces himself via a long monologue, where he moves through the people around him talking only to us. The backstreets of Milan, with their urchins gathered on corners and their high wooden scaffolds, have the look of a stage set, and at the start of episode two we go full musical, with a sort of techno-rap dance interlude. There are a lot of political ideas and opinions to chew through; the obvious answer would be to omit some, but Wright glories in them instead, giving us not just a primer on the rise of Italian fascism, but also a comprehensive compendium of thingsJoe Wrightthinks look cool. Ballot slips spin in a cage as Mussolini spins a grenade on his desk; the mouths of his detractors appear through holes in a black screen; characters are filmed from above, from the side, in disorienting closeup or from bewilderingly far away.This is a shame, because when Son of the Century plays it straight, it does so very well. Marinelli is the sort of actor other performers long to share a two-hander with and, although they tend to be too lengthy, most of the unadorned dialogue scenes bristle with intrigue. Mussolini sparring with his right-hand man, Cesare Rossi (Francesco Russo), is a delight; we are never totally sure who is controlling whom. There is a similar dynamic with Mussolini’s mistress, muse and mentor, Margherita Sarfatti (Barbara Chichiarelli), a canny socialite who gets off on Il Duce’s lack of sophistication – when they kiss, it’s as if two sentient sink plungers are fighting to the death – but who also has the capacity to humiliate him at her fancy futurist salons. That political authoritarians tend to resent and demean the women in their life comes through strongly in Mussolini’s treatment of his neglected wife and a horribly abused secretary.Cut it in half and Son of the Century would be a potent portrait of a pathetic monster, brilliantly performed and striking to look at. Like the direction, some of the sets are wildly over the top, but the echoing marble mansions, dingy town halls and slums conjure up the right air of sepia-tinted decline, the conditions in which the worst kind of politics can flourish. If only this series could have stuck to its point.Mussolini: Son of the Century airs on Sky Atlantic and is available on NowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionJoe WrightBenito MussolinireviewsShareReuse this content"

As I wrotelast year’s wrap, there had already been major big-money sales – $10m for A Real Pain, $17m for It’s What’s Inside, $15m for My Old Ass, $5m for Presence – some smaller ones – Thelma, Ghostlight, Ibelin, Daughters, Skywalkers and Kneecap – and in the 48 hours after there were even more – Dìdi to Focus and Will & Harper to Netflix. Post-strikes it was a reassuringly robust marketplace with gaps that needed to be filled but just a year later, things are looking far less comforting.Together review – codependent relationship body horror is a fun rideRead moreThere were even more questions over quality – I heard many a grumble in the press line over a lack of breakouts – but even so, as of writing, there have been only four deals confirmed, a worryingly dour result for what’s seen as one of America’s most important markets. Films with sellable names like Jennifer Lopez, Olivia Colman,Benedict Cumberbatchand Josh O’Connor and some of the best-reviewed titles remain without distribution.A sense of cautiousness might explain why the most immediately competitive title was a horror film, still one of the only close-to-sure genres in Hollywood. That film wasTogether, a slickly made body horror picked up by Neon for a reported $17m, after fighting off competition from A24. It stars the real-life husband-and-wife duo Alison Brie and Dave Franco as a codependent couple who find themselves drawn to each other even more when they stumble upon a gnarly infection that forces their flesh together. While it would have been an easy yes in any year, we are now living in a post-Substance world, the Demi Moore-fronted sleeper scoring both strong box office and surprise Oscar nominations. While Together is unlikely to be an awards darling, a swiftly announced August release date should make it a solid late summer hit.View image in fullscreenSorry, Baby’s Lucas Hedges, Eva Victor and Naomi Ackie.Photograph: George Pimentel/REX/Shutterstock for Sundance Film FestivalThe film was also one of the most universally liked of the festival (it’s maintained a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes), a distinction also shared by another buzzy sale, albeit on a far smaller scale. The comedian Eva Victor’s debutSorry, Babyhad already seemed like a perfect fit for A24 before it even showed interest – it’s produced by Barry Jenkins, who has a relationship with the company after Moonlight and Aftersun, it’s a writer-director-actor showcase of someone known for their poppy virality and it’s an unusual #MeToo narrative loosely similar to I May Destroy You. It was an $8m pickup for the distributor who will probably give it a low-key awards push later in the year. The Oscar conversation will also likely include another big sale of the festival, the period dramaTrain Dreamswhich was bought by Netflix for a figure that’sreportedlyin the high teen millions. The film stars Joel Edgerton and the recent two-time Oscar nominee Felicity Jones as a couple at the start of the 20th century living in the American west and boasts the same creative team as Sing Sing. Across the board praise for Edgerton should see him become a strong best actor contender.A rather less surefire best actress contender also emerged in the first weekend in the unlikely shape ofIf I Had Legs I’d Kick You, a anxiety-fueled dark comedy about motherhood with a career-best performance from a remarkable Rose Byrne. The film, from the writer-director Mary Bronstein, already has A24 behind it, but it’s a divisive, deliberately difficult watch that could prove too alienating for many voters.View image in fullscreenTwinless stars James Sweeney and Dylan O’Brien.Photograph: Jay L Clendenin/REX/ShutterstockThe festival kicked off with two narrative features that landed at opposite ends of the spectrum. The director Sophie Hyde, who’d scored Sundance success with 52 Tuesdays, Animals and the Emma Thompson-fronted Good Luck to You, Leo Grande, stumbled with her latest, the personal dramaJimpa. Despite strong performances from Olivia Colman and John Lithgow, the film struggled to impress critics on the ground and will be a tough one to sell. But then later that night, the Straight Up writer-director-actor James Sweeney found himself the talk of the town after his second feature, the wonderfully indefinableTwinless, premiered to rave reviews. A twisty, genre-shifting mix of grief drama, Hitchcock thriller and dark comedy, it’s perhaps the film’s unusual nature that’s left it unsold at this stage given how strong the response has been (another 100% rating that also picked up the audience award). The film drew controversy at the tail-end of the festival after leaks led to it being pulled from the digital platform that allows for consumers to rent certain titles. Sex scenes including its star Dylan O’Brien (who gave one of the festival’s most impressive breakout performances) plus major plot reveals were shared on social media, the second film (after a doc about the tragic singer Selena Quintanilla) to be leaked and then pulled.The app had been introduced as an inevitable addition during Covid times so journalists could cover the festival remotely but given how it became a strong money-maker for the festival (a reported half a million people used the portal in 2021) it stayed ever since. But with the leaks, especially as many of the films available are seeking buyers, questions remain over whether it will return next year at least in the current iteration.View image in fullscreenJennifer Lopez.Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/APMany more high-profile films chose to steer clear of the app, which was perhaps wisest forKiss of the Spider Woman, a Jennifer Lopez-led musical restaging of the prison-set queer drama. The Broadway adaptation’s many splashy technicolor setpieces would have surely landed online within minutes but while Lopez, who responded tearfully to a standing ovation, received praise for her singing and dancing, the film was met with mostly mixed reviews. It’s a tough proposition for many buyers even with the musical resurgence (Wicked, it ain’t) although I could see a smart distributor position it for a Lopez Golden Globe nod.An even tougher sell, with even rougher reviews, was led by another of the festival’s bigger stars, the Benedict Cumberbatch-fronted and Film 4-funded grief horror-dramaThe Thing With Feathers. Based on the much-loved novella, the film couldn’t capitalise on a packed-out Saturday night premiere, reminding too many of previous Sundance hit The Babadook. The night before also saw Cumberbatch’s Henry Sugar co-star Dev Patel receive similarly spotty reviews for the Wales-set folk horrorRabbit Trap, yet they were fawning in comparison to those that met Brit Himesh Patel’s comedy Bubble & Squeak, a cabbage-smuggling comedy that was widely viewed as the worst of the fest. Another well-known British actor who had more success was Ben Whishaw, who came with his second film under the Passages director Ira Sachs, the talky two-hander Peter Hujar’s Day. It had a warm reception but given how much smaller it is than their last film together (it’s essentially a 76-minute art film), it sold to a much smaller distributor in Sideshow and Janus Films.View image in fullscreenLurker writer-director Alex Russell and stars Théodore Pellerin, Archie Madekwe and Havana Rose Liu.Photograph: George Pimentel/REX/Shutterstock for Sundance Film FestivalMany of the buzzier titles, like the aforementioned Sorry, Baby and Twinless, managed to attract attention without such stars attached and with less attention-demanding premiere slots. On Tuesday evening, even as many critics had already left, the celebrity culture thrillerLurkerquickly became one of the festival’s most enthusiastically received titles, the first-time writer-director Alex Russell’s dark tale of a retail worker attaching himself to a musician feeling like one of the easier commercial sells of the festival. It was a genre hit unlike the disastrously receivedOpus, another story set in the music industry that was a rare A24 miss, a film that most people were quick to criticise on the ground.For while some films did attract applause, it was mostly of the polite kind. There was no Get Out or Past Lives or Little Miss Sunshine this year, at least not on the narrative side of things. The delayed Oscar nominations landed just as the festival was kicking off and while the best picture 10 was lacking a Sundance premiere (A Real Pain just missed out), the documentary category featured four of them. It was a fitting kick-off for a festival that was widely viewed as more impressive for docs again with standouts including films onhorrendous conditions in an Alabama prison,the troubled history of To Catch a Predator,the loves and life of Jeff Buckley,the rise of anti-trans rhetoric,the Russia-Ukraine war through the eyes of those fighting it,bigoted book bans in Americaanda Russian teacher dealing with life under Putin. But it’s been similarly dismal commercially without any sold to date, a potentially concerning sign of wider fears over content that might be deemed too controversial under a rightwing president.In 2023, two major docs, Union and No Other Land, ended up without any distribution with many speculating that their themes – the first on Amazon’s many labor issues and the second on Israeli violence and occupation in the West Bank – frightened buyers. While the latter still scored an Oscar nomination despite its lack of formal release, this years festival taking place just days after the inauguration added an unmistakable layer of caution to an already caution-heavy marketplace, a feeling that taking any added commercial or political risk is going to be even harder at such a volatile time.Explore more on these topicsSundance 2025Sundance film festivalFilm industryFestivalsDocumentary filmsJennifer LopezBenedict CumberbatchfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The makers of Becoming Led Zeppelin relive the tactics – and cups of tea – that got it green litRobin DenselowTue 4 Feb 2025 10.12 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2025 17.17 ESTShareBernard MacMahon says he knew he was taking a massive risk. The Irish-British film-maker and his Scottish partner Allison McGourty had spent 10 months researching a film about that massively successful but elusive rock bandLed Zeppelin. They put together a storyboard, listened to every interview they could find, and started to dig out archive film to tell the story of the band’s early years in the late 60s.That was when Jimmy Page, a successful session guitarist, joined the Yardbirds, then wanted to create a band of his own. He signed up John Paul Jones, another virtuoso session star, and two little-known West Midlands musicians: the wildly inventive drummer John Bonham, and singerRobert Plant. Overlooked in Britain, Led Zeppelin found fame in America, where they were attacked in the music press but became celebrities through their live shows, without the help of the media.Jimmy Page arrived carrying a Waitrose bag. I thought he’d brought sandwiches with himThe film-makers’ research was funded, says MacMahon, on the understanding that “it was incredibly likely that once I put in a phone call, the group might say they were not interested. There was every chance we would not even get a meeting.” After all, Led Zeppelin had always refused most interviews or TV appearances – let alone an authorised film biography in which the three surviving members would appear.But Page did agree to a meeting, at a hotel in London in November 2017, to which he arrived carrying Waitrose shopping bags. “I wondered if he had brought sandwiches,” says MacMahon, who took out a leather-bound book with the storyboard – “pictures but no words” – and started talking through it. When he got to the part of the story where Page first meets Plant, the guitarist asked which band he was then in. “Hobbstweedle,” was the answer. “Very good,” said Page. “Carry on.”Later he queried a date with MacMahon, “and opened the shopping bags to show he had brought his old diaries, dating back to the 60s”. After seven hours “with a break for afternoon tea”, Page said: “I’m in – but you have to get the others on board.”A few days later he rang MacMahon and asked “would you like to go to Pangbourne with me?”, then accompanied the film-makers to see the boathouse where he once lived, where the band had rehearsed. “Later,” says McGourty, “he revealed it had been a test. ‘If you had said no to Pangbourne we wouldn’t have done the film.’”Next to be approached was bass and keyboard player John Paul Jones, who said he was “not interested in a documentary”. So MacMahon sent him a copy ofAmerican Epic, the duo’s documentary series about the impact of the first-ever recordings of blues, country, cajun and Mexican musicians back in the 1920s, which Robert Redford, who narrated it, called “America’s greatest untold story”. MacMahon asked Jones to “watch 15 minutes, and if you don’t want to talk to us after that, you won’t hear from us again and that will be the end of the film”. Jones rang back, they had a four-hour chat, and he too was in.View image in fullscreenThe band in London in 1968 … from left, John Paul Jones, Jimmy Page, Robert Plant and John Bonham.Photograph: Dick Barnatt/RedfernsSo that left Plant, who seemed the least likely to talk – partly because he was enjoyinga successful, varied careerand because Zeppelin had ended tragically, with the death of Bonham in 1980. But he was a fan of American Epic, as he told MacMahon and McGourty when they met him at a concert in Scotland. After two more meetings, he agreed to talk back in Birmingham.His interview is delightfully candid. He describes how he became a musician in defiance of his parents, who wanted him to be a chartered accountant, and how in his struggling early years he would siphon petrol from other peoples’ cars.Bonham also appears in the film – in voice if not vision. MacMahon had heard a “bad quality bootleg” of an interview he had given in Australia, but had no idea where it came from. But after lengthy research, and the perseverance of an archivist, it was found in a pile of uncatalogued radio tapes. Bonham plays a crucial role in the film “because he acts as a narrator. His interviews were recorded just after things had happened. Jimmy said in some ways he’s the star of the film because he’s in the moment.”To keep the three surviving band members in the moment as well, MacMahon says: “We had memorabilia in the room when we were doing the interviews, constantly showing them clips and photographs, old newspapers, ticket stubs … anything we could think of that would be entertaining. In the film we show Jimmy looking at footage of the Bath festival he hadn’t seen before. That’s why for me it’s like a feature film … they are walking you through the story, as they hit each new obstacle … they are reliving it”.MacMahon says that once the band had agreed to the film, they never interfered or demanded any editorial control. But he wanted to “make sure what they were saying was backed up by their contemporaries”, so after Jones had talked about buying an organ for a church and becoming a choir master at the age of 14, he tracked down the priest involved. And when Page talked about playing on Goldfinger, MacMahon tracked down Vic Flick, the James Bond theme guitarist.View image in fullscreenAt the Chateau Marmont hotel in LA, 1969.Photograph: ZUMA Press, Inc./AlamyThe interviews were conducted in 2018, after which the duo worked on sourcing the music that makes up much of the film – either from early Zeppelin themselves, or musicians who influenced them or that they had worked with. Searching out rare archive recordings they were introduced to Sam Rapallo, who runs the band’s website, and entered “the mysterious world of Led Zeppelin collecting. The band are very publicity shy, and fans often mirror the personality of a group.”McGourty travelled across America and Britain, finding high quality film of Dazed and Confused in an attic in the New Forest, and of I Can’t Quit You Baby in an Oxfordshire village. They searched out original negatives or tapes to get the best sound, and when taking sound from an album they used “the very best lacquers, to make you feel you were there”. Unlike in most music documentaries, many of the songs are played in full, “because they are meant to be heard that way”.The film ends with What Is and What Should Never Be, filmed at Zeppelin’s headlining show at the Royal Albert Hall, London, in 1970. It is a triumphant finale that leaves out what was to follow – the exploration of more acoustic styles, Page’s fascination with Aleister Crowley and the occult, the decade of massive financial success, the stories of sex, drugs and rock’n’roll excess … and even Stairway to Heaven. So why stop there?“Because I always felt this was a self-contained story,” says MacMahon. “In January 1970 they have become the most popular band in north America and now return to Britain. In that closing song the audience now accept them as returning heroes. All the band’s families are there and this is the coming together of their childhood story.”True to form, the three surviving members will not be appearing on TV or giving interviews to promote Becoming Led Zeppelin. But they have issued quotes. Page says “the energy of the story and power of the music is phenomenal”, while for Plant, “American Epic inspired me to contribute to … a remarkable journey into the heart of the whirlwind.”Becoming Led Zeppelin opens in Imax on 5 February, and in other cinemas on 7 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsLed ZeppelinDocumentaryMusic documentaryRobert PlantfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They seek him there! For the last 10 days or so, Ed Miliband has been the Invisible Man. A large number of the cabinet were in Oxfordshire for Rachel Reeves’s growth speech last Wednesday. Ed was not.Those who didn’t make the trip were in the Commons later on for prime minister’s questions as Keir Starmer reinforced the growth message. Ed was not. Some ministers lent their support as Darren Jones gave a statement on growth. Ed did not.Check Ed’s ministerial diary for the past week and you will find it had been largely empty. There had been no clashes to keep him away from his colleagues. Rather, Ed had barricaded himself in his office. Refusing to open the door even when one of his advisers asked to be let in. Bread and water were left outside. He was there for the duration.It is the saddest story ever told. Miliband and Reeves used to be the closest of friends. Rachel was a key member of Team Ed when he stood for the leadership of theLabourparty in 2010 and was rewarded with a shadow cabinet job the following year despite having only been an MP for 12 months. They were inseparable.Fast forward to the present day. They don’t ring each other. They don’t text. They barely even speak. The process of conscious uncoupling is a painful one. Therapists have tried to mediate but to no great effect. Healing is a long way away.The problem is the economy. Rachel is willing todo whatever it takes to promote growth in the UK. Ed thinks there needs to be boundaries. Expanding airports has to be within carbon emission targets. No new drilling licences. Neither is willing to budge. They are on a collision course. Something will have to give.View image in fullscreenEd and Rachel in happier times. At the Oxo Tower in London in 2012.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAOn Tuesday, Miliband finally came out of his bunker for energy security and net zero departmental questions. And, to be fair, he did not look much like a tortured soul. Either he’s coping with the breakup reasonably well or else he’s a good actor. Probably the former.He looked bright and chipper, if slightly disappointed that his opposite number, Claire Coutinho, was away on maternity leave. Every secretary of state needs a Claire. Someone who is not that bright and doesn’t really understand her brief.You soon saw why Ed looked so happy with life. He is a man who believes he has the angels on his side. More importantly, he believes he has the Labour backbenchers and supporters on his side. When it comes to Labour’s net zero and climate change commitments, most Labour MPs are all for them.They think these things matter. Not just because it’s important to keep your manifesto commitments, but also because the planet will be screwed if you don’t. Climate change targets are not mutable. They can’t be traded for short-term growth targets. Well, not entirely. Some are willing to compromise on Heathrow. Butnew oil fields are a no-no.Just how much the Labour backbenchers love Miliband could be seen by the number of difficult questions they asked him. None. We know that many are furious with Reeves and Starmer over Heathrow andRosebank, but they chose to keep quiet.Partly because they didn’t want to turn a private row into a public one, but largely because they didn’t want to make life more difficult than it already is for Ed. They know he is single-handedly fighting a battle with his cabinet colleagues and reckon he is best helped by not causing him any embarrassment in the Commons. If in doubt, avoid the minefield.So Ed could rest easy. Safe in the knowledge there was no danger on the benches behind him. The hardest questions he got from his own side were requests for more solar farms and invitations to criticise the opposition for its lack of progress towards energy security.Miliband didn’t need to be asked twice. There’s nothing he likes more than a bit of Tory-bashing. Even if these days that’s a bit like taking candy from a baby. But what the hell?

Even the questions from the opposition benches could be answered in his sleep. Junior shadow minister Joy Morrissey set the tone. Never the brightest of any group in which she finds herself, Joy has never yet found an occasion to which she can’t live down.“A-ha!” she said. You granted a licence to Dale Vince. And he’s a Labour donor. That means there must have been a conflict of interest. Ed yawned. Try to keep up. This stuff was just a waste of his time. It was a matter of public record that he had recused himself from this particular decision. He was surprised Morrissey hadn’t checked the register before asking the question. No one else was. Joy gives halfwits a bad name.In this government’s hands, big ideas always end up looking small. Just ask Ed Miliband | Rafael BehrRead moreTory Harriet “drill, baby, drill” Cross at least tried to raise the Rosebank oilfield. Would the planning licence be considered as an existing application rather than a new one? Bearing in mind Labour had committed to not granting any new ones?Miliband rather dodged the issue, choosing instead to observe that the problem had only arisen because the Conservatives had given an unlawful consent. He nodded and winked towards his own side. Read my lips. Trust me. Rosebank goes ahead over my dead body.But departmental questions is seldom without its comedy. So thank God for Andrew Bowie, the shadow energy minister who is stepping in for Coutinho. Andy is the gift that keeps on giving. Back when the Tories were in government, he had to be moved from his job as pylons minister because he was found to be campaigning against pylons in his own constituency. Literally, left hand meet right. The same could be said of his synapses. He can only wish. He asked something about Great British Energy, but by the time he had finished his sentence no one was listening. He is not a serious person.The best laugh came right at the end when Richard Tice started moaning about fossil fuel prices in the same breath as shouting “net stupid zero”. If he can’t see the link, he’s beyond help. Though I guess we knew that.Ed tried to break it to him gently. Net zero was about energy security. TAKING BACK CONTROL. Dicky looked amazed. He’d never thought of this. Ed just smiled. Now he could go back to his department. Where the real battles were fought. But for an hour we had been treated to a cabinet minister on top of his brief and unapologetic. It could catch on.Explore more on these topicsEd MilibandThe politics sketchGreen politicsLabourRachel ReevescommentShareReuse this content"

After reading the works of psychologist Carl Jung, I see midlifeintrospection as a necessityAngela GarbesTue 4 Feb 2025 12.33 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2025 13.02 ESTShareLast year, I described being an author to my child’s third grade classroom as “doing homework and writing reports all the time”. I often write personal narrative, and it occurred to me that I am constantly researching and expounding on myself.I might have felt self-conscious about this in my twenties or thirties, afraid of seeming narcissistic. But now, nearing 50, I don’t care – because, following an interest that grew into enthrallment, I’ve been reading the works of the psychologist Carl Jung.“For a young person it is almost a sin, or at least a danger, to be too preoccupied with himself; but for the aging person it is a duty and necessity to devote serious attention to himself,” Jung wrote in his 1931 essay The Stages of Life.This sounds like navel-gazing. But it’s important because in middle age, the life I thought I was living and the life I was actually living were suddenly incongruous. Since I turned 40, my reactions to life events have been surprising, and sometimes disturbing. The birth of my second child and the publication ofmy first book– both happy occasions – left me feeling empty, seeking external validation. Covid-19 isolation led me tosubstance use disorder, which jeopardized my health and family life.My dismay at all of this made me take a hard look at myself.We cannot live the afternoon of life according to the program of life’s morningCarl JungOver the last five years I’ve committed to therapy, a 12-step sobriety program and other emotional work. I now have a much more honest understanding of who I am, what I have been through and the coping mechanisms I’ve used. I accept my flaws and feel more capable of being the person I want to be. While I’ve come a long way, it’s occasionally disheartening to be reminded that healing is a nonlinear, lifelong process that requires vigilance and continued effort.You could call all this a “midlife crisis”, but I find Jung’s description much more accurate: an “inexorable inner process” that “enforces the contraction of life”. Turning inward and narrowing focus on to myself has given me clarity.Jung believed that too many of us proceed through midlife holding fast to ways of being that no longer serve us. His metaphor for the course of our lives – the sun rising and setting – is so basic that it’s revelatory.“We cannot live the afternoon of life according to the program of life’s morning; for what was great in the morning will be little at evening, and what in the morning was true will in evening have become a lie,” he writes.More from Angela Garbes’Halfway there:No sex drive and a ‘tanking libido’: how I redefined intimacy in midlifeFirst my left knee, then my right: my middle-aged body’s betrayalPerimenopause has brought chaos to my life – but also peaceDreams I held in youth – to be an artist, to be celebrated for my writing and ideas – have come true. Honestly, they have wildly exceeded my expectations. A younger version of myself would charge forward, seeking more success and recognition. But confronting difficult truths about myself has led me to a different place. Here, the life I have created is enough.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionOne of the gifts of midlife is realistic self-evaluation, sans bravado and hyperactive self-criticism. It can turn even fundamental values and beliefs upside down. My immigrant parents told me that in order to be successful, I had to assimilate and make myself legible to white people. As a student, I excelled in written communication and was rewarded for it. Making money by formulating and expressing my ideas about culture and identity seemed almost too good to be true. Creativity, imagination and values are essential to my work, but being articulate, accessible and acceptable drove my work for years.Recently I read the sociologist Bianca Mabute-Louie’s bookUnassimilable: An Asian Diasporic Manifesto for the 21st Century,a personal and political examination of identity within the Asian diaspora. I related strongly to Mabute-Louie’s experiences as a woman navigating and succeeding in primarily white institutions. She also argues that assimilation and the identity marker “Asian American” are no longer politically viable or useful ideas – and this challenged me. I agree with Mabute-Louie, but I also realized that her ideas are more forward-thinking and relevant to this moment than mine.Writing my will sent me into an existential spiralRead moreThis was destabilizing. I still love my work; writing is my vocation. But I also long to spend time with my friends, spouse and the children in my life. I want to take creative risks and leisurely pursue hobbies without the pressure of needing to be good: mend and sew poorly, semi-successfully grow vegetables and propagate houseplants, paint decent watercolor portraits.It is nice to be listened to, but now I plan to make room for others, learn from them, and grow quietly into the next phase of my life. I don’t want to do what I see some from older generations doing: refusing to stand down, clinging feebly to power and old ideas.“After having lavished its light upon the world, the sun withdraws its rays in order to illuminate itself,” Jung writes. “Instead of doing likewise, many old people prefer to be … applauders of the past or else eternal adolescents.” I shudder at the thought of holding on to what was. So I let go. The golden hour before sunset bathes us in gorgeous light, and I plan to luxuriate in this new view.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyPsychologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Making people who are already threatened in the world more threatened.”Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, announced last monthit would no longer use independent factcheckerson its social media sites, and would replace them with “community notes”. Similar to the system used on X, these give users the power to challenge the accuracy of posts.Zuckerberg, now chief executive ofMeta, said third-party moderators were “too politically biased” and it was “time to get back to our roots around free expression”.The move came as Zuckerberg and other technology executives sought to improve relations with US presidentDonald Trump, who had criticised Meta’s factchecking policy as censorship of rightwing voices.After the changes were announced, Trump praised Zuckerberg’s decision. Zuckerberg, X chairman Elon Musk, and Amazon founder,Jeff Bezos, were all present at the president’s inauguration last month.Eisenberg said he was “concerned” by the developments. The actor, who is currently promotingthe Oscar-nominated A Real Pain, which he wrote, directed and stars in, added: “These people have billions upon billions of dollars, like more money than any human person has ever amassed and what are they doing with it?“Oh, they’re doing it to curry favour with somebody who’s preaching hate.“That’s what I think ... not as like a person who played in a movie. I think of it as somebody who is married to a woman who teaches disability justice in New York and lives for her students are going to get a little harder this year.”Last week,Trump signed a legal settlementthat will see Meta pay out roughly $25m (£20m) over the suspension of his accounts after the 6 January Capitol riots in 2021.Explore more on these topicsJesse EisenbergThe Social NetworkOscarsMark ZuckerbergMetaFacebookSocial medianewsShareReuse this content"

TheEdwin Smith papyrus, dating from about 3,500BC, mentions cold applications for skin irritations.Were they ... in denial?[Groans.] Yes, probably, given there was no refrigeration in ancient Egypt. Moving swiftly along, in the early 18th century, a Scottish physician named William Cullen began to use cold-water immersion to treat various ailments.Icy water is a lot easier to find in Scotland.In the latter part of the 20th century, athletes started to use cold water to speed up recovery and optimise performance. More recently, ice baths have become a wellness trend, popular with influencers and celebrities.The Dutch dude?“Iceman”Wim Hof, yes, he’s one.I did his method. For about a week.Me too. I found icy baths harder (OK, unbearable) when the weather got a bit colder. There may be good news, though. A new study …Proper or Mickey Mouse study?Legit. Researchers from the University of South Australia, analysing data from 11 studies comprising 3,177 participants, published their findings in the peer-reviewed, open‑accessjournal Plos One.Love that journal!Give me the headlines.Cold-water immersion is a big waste of time?All pain, nogain?It’s not quite that simple, but the benefits are time-dependent.Just do it in summer?That would be season-dependent. Inflammation actually increases after exposure to cold water, while stress reduction occurs only 12 hours later.So, “I’ll just quickly de-stress in this frozen lake”is a myth, then. What about sickness prevention?Regular cold showers were shown to lead to 29% fewer sick days from work …Boo, who wants to go to work anyway?But they don’t affect how long illnesses last when you do get sick.There you go! And the wellbeing stuff?Mood remained unchanged. There were some benefits to sleep quality and overall wellbeing, but most effects faded after 90 days.I knew it, short-termism!But with immune function, while showing no immediate changes, long-term benefitswereobserved.[Hands over ears] La la la, not listening now. And you know what I’m saying?What are you saying?I’m saying this important scientific study pours cold water on the ice-bath nonsense.Of course you are. As usual, the reality is more nuanced – more research is needed, utilising larger, more diverse sample sizes.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Dry January may be behind us, but more and more of us are choosing to ditch the hard stuff year-round. Lighter on the waistline and wallet and hangxiety-free, low ABV (alcohol by volume) drinks have surged in popularity in recent years. A 2024 YouGov survey found almost half of young people regularly choose low- or no-alcohol drinks – and 39% of 18- to 24-year-olds never drink alcohol at all.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Whether you want to cement the good habits you formed during dry January, stay dry full-time or are simply tonight’s designated driver, there are plenty of tempting low- and no-alcohol tipples to try. Andzebra striping(alternating alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks) is no chore when the 0% category is as refreshing as we have today.From beers that taste like the real deal to zero-alcohol fizz worth celebrating, there’s a low-alcohol drink to tickle everyone’s fancy. I’ve worked my way through more than 60 different booze-free beers, wines, spirits, kombuchas, premixed drinks and everything in between to find the best the category has to offer.To qualify for inclusion in this list, drinks had to be under 2% ABV (many between 6% and 10% are also worth seeking out if you’re aiming to reduce, not replace). As well as tasting delicious, they also had to be a convincing alternative to an alcoholic counterpart. I recognise that many people searching for lo-alcohol drinks don’t want something that looks, feels or tastes like booze, but for the purposes of this test, I did. That said, many of the fabulous healthy sparkling waters and fermented drinks I tried were far preferable to some of the alcoholic-free wines out there.Here, then, is my pick of the best low- and no-alcohol drinks to raise a glass to, safe in the knowledge there’s no hangover in the post.The best non-alcoholic and low-alcohol drinks for 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: wilpunt/Getty ImagesBest low-alcohol red wineView image in fullscreenModerato Merlot-Tannat Cuvée Révolutionnaire 0.5%£13.99 at MajesticOf all the low-alcohol alternatives, a decent red wine is probably the hardest to find. Some taste like plasticky grape juice, while others try to replicate the complexity of an alcoholic red by introducing rogue flavours such as beetroot and herbs.No one will mistake this Moderato for a fully fledged merlot, but it does have the characteristic dark fruit notes of that grape, and its structure puts it firmly on the wine spectrum, rather than juice. Overall, it tastes extremely pleasant. Using grapes sourced from vineyards in south-west France, this wine is cold-distilled in the country’s first de-alcoholising centre, where they keep a careful eye on retaining the structure and aroma of the original wine. A decent food wine with rich casseroles and warming tagines, or enjoyed alone.Best low-alcohol ginView image in fullscreenEverleaf Mountain, 0.4%£22 at Everleaf£22 at MajesticEverleaf isn’t billed as a non-alcoholic gin, as some are, but more loosely as an aperitif; this particular variety is a showcase of fruity floral botanicals inspired by mountain flavours. To me, this is an enjoyable alternative to sweeter, strawberry-forward pink gins, when served with quality tonic, ice and a slice. Summer flavours abound, with a welcome bitterness from rosehip keeping it from becoming saccharine. I served this to teetotal relatives at a drinks party, who praised it highly; as a real gin fan, I’m very happy drinking it too.Best sparkling teaView image in fullscreenLA Brewery Sparkling English Blush, 0.0%£11.99 at Virgin Wines£13 at LA BreweryThis was among my absolute favourites. It’s a sparkling kombucha, but feels and tastes really special – starting with the cork for popping. Crafted in a Suffolk microbrewery, this explodes with English fruit; wild strawberries and fresh rhubarb dominate, while the funk of kombucha adds a necessary tang to balance the natural sweetness. It’s actually low in sugar, and has the benefit of being packed with live cultures – but this is so lovely you don’t need to convince anyone with its health benefits. I recommend it for a celebration, even if all you’re celebrating is the fact it’s a Friday.Best dealcoholised sparkling wineView image in fullscreenBolle blanc de blancs, <0.5%£18.99 at Drink Supermarket£19.99 at VinoZeroSparkling wines are probably the safest bet in the low and no category. FromNozecotoVilarnau cava, I liked almost all of the low-alcohol fizzes I sampled and many were truly excellent. This one edged ahead because of how expensive it tastes. It’s made in Spain using chardonnay grapes and is double fermented (as with champagne and cava) before being dealcoholised, and it’s a real treat however you look at it. It had a recognisable blanc de blancs profile – crisp orchard fruit and brioche notes – along with a properly persistent champagne-like mousse and a dryish finish. I’ll be buying this again.For morebooze-free bubbly, read our guide on thebestlow-alcohol prosecco, champagne and sparkling winesBest mocktailView image in fullscreenBelvoir Farm non-alcoholic lime and yuzu mojito£3.25 at Tesco£3.40 at WaitroseBelvoir Farm is better known for its nice cordials and soft drinks, but it now boasts one of the biggest mocktail ranges in the UK. With passion fruit martini, peach bellini and more to choose from, my pick is the Great Taste Award-winning lime and yuzu mojito, which is fresh, zesty and aromatic. Luscious-tasting and super-cooling, this mocktail is good on its own, but when muddled properly with fresh mint and lots of ice, no one would miss the real thing. I loved the unexpected edge that the yuzu brings.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Darkly complex and intriguing, this new US-based alcohol-free spirit uses hemp, angelica root, juniper, saffron and other wild botanicals distilled into a liquid that works alone or in cocktails – as seen at the London cocktail bars Lyaness and Satan’s Whiskers. If you’re a fan of negroni, fernet or other amaro, then this is likely up your street. Try stirred with bitters, ice and a twist of orange for an alcohol-free twist on your favourites.Best low-alcohol lagerView image in fullscreenBrooklyn Brewery Special Effects hoppy lager, 0.4%£2.52 at Dry Drinker£53.99 for 24 bottles at AmazonLow and no beers have been pretty good quality from the off, with the independent breweries generally doing cooler, more interesting and great-tasting things than the big brands. Brooklyn Brewery’s Special Effects hoppy lager is an unfailingly good all-rounder and easily holds its own against any alcoholic lager. It’s light, bright and so full of authentic, fresh hop flavours that it may even pass as the real thing.Best low-alcohol aleView image in fullscreenFirebrand Brewing Co Shorebreak hazy pale ale, 0.5%£2.69 at Wise Bartender£3 at Drink FinderWhen summer finally arrives, you’ll be hard pressed to find a better drink to enjoy on the beach than this Cornish IPA. Ridiculously smooth, light and zingy with hoppy flavours, Firebrand Brewing’s Shorebreak bursts with hazily chilled tropical fruit flavours such as pineapple, guava and banana. You might struggle to tell if it’s alcoholic or not – and when it tastes this great, for just 35 calories a can, who cares?Best low-alcohol ciderView image in fullscreenSandford Orchards Red Zero, 0.5%£27 for 12 at Sandford OrchardsLow-alcohol cider is a little trickier to get right than beer. Some are cloyingly sweet, others taste too straightforwardly of apples, while my previous favourite low-alcohol cider (theMaison Sassy Poir) has an ABV a touch too high for this list. This new Red Zero cider from Devon producer Sandford Orchards is created sustainably in the same way as its award-winning alcoholic cider – local cider apples are pressed, fermented and matured before the alcohol is removed. It’s juicy and tangy, with a fruity funk ripe for a pub garden.Best alcohol-free tequila-style spirit (yes, really)View image in fullscreenAlmave Blancoblue agave spirit, 0%£21.89 at Master of Malt£20.45 at AmazonA zero-proof tequila-style spirit may not be the first thing you’d think to turn to when you’re not drinking, but this was an unexpected hit. Almave was founded by Lewis Hamilton in partnership with Mexican spirits group Casa Lumbre, and it has an immediately distinctive agave aroma, smelling and tasting extremely convincing. It’s genuinely nice even for sipping straight, but when made into a spicy margarita or mixed with grapefruit in a paloma it’s fantastic.Joanne Gould is a freelance food, drink and lifestyle writer with a decade of experience.

Was it art? Was it fashion? Were they even invited?Tue 4 Feb 2025 09.28 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2025 10.52 ESTShareWhat precisely is the deal with Kanye West and his wife, Bianca Censori, whose latest very surprising red-carpet outing very unsurprisingly featured her being next-to-naked? Bianca’s husband, who dresses like a Minecraft security guard, seemed to be giving her the signal to shed her fur coat and reveal herself outsideSunday night’s Grammys, to which they don’t appear to have been invited. Certainly a hot new twist on the old 13th fairy act.Given that Bianca is rarely photographed in anything heavier than a 5-denier sex poncho, half the internet seems to have settled definitively on the conviction that she is being coercively controlled. The other half has decided the pair enjoy the attention their “art project” is receiving. I’m not sure it’s entirely clear which is the case, or indeed whether it’s a bit of both for now, and in any case she may reevaluate her opinions about the situation in retrospect as time goes by.By way of a recap for Guardian readers not obsessed with the byzantine court politics of Yeezy (guys, please: this stuff is important): Kanye and Bianca married in 2023, following the sundering of his union with reality-industrial-complex mogulKim Kardashian. Bianca and Kanye seem to have met via the latter’s previously mentioned fashion brand, where she was hired as the chief architect. Stay with this, because the sneakers Kanye produces are so hideously absurd that they may well have featured mock-Tudor heel gables and Juliet balconies. Even so, being the chief architect of a fashion company does feel a little like being the chief veterinary officer of a teapot factory.Then again maybe all virulent antisemites need a chief architect. I’m not saying Bianca was the Albert Speer of Yeezy, planning ever more triumphalist colonnaded sneakers, only for these dreams to end in rubble when the boss overreached himself. But the fact remained that Kanye’s collaboration with Adidas did end up imploding, shortly after he fired out a barrage of Jew-hate across pretty much every possible platform, appended bythe explainer: “I can literally say antisemitic shit, and they can’t drop me.” Not so, as it turned out. (Maybe he read somesecond world war historybooks and wrongly assumed the old rules of the firm still applied.)These days, the Wests stage regular silent happenings for the paparazzi, which are parsed by everyone from lip-readers to armchair hostage video experts to determine if Bianca is having fun or not. She certainly seemed to be, inan enthusiastic karaoke performanceat a Grammys afterparty – but appearances can be deceptive. There’s rather more to run on this one before the world can know for sure.For now, perhaps we have to take the word of Bianca’s tirelessly curatedpersonal website, which is a strong pusher of the notion that she and Kanye are a mutually supportive pair of performance artists. “While many were initially fascinated by her private life,” it acknowledges of her rise to fame, “her role at Yeezy – West’s fashion brand – quickly became the focus.” Did it though?Perhaps more luck will be had on that front now, thanks to Bianca’s announcement that she is releasing a documentary about herself this year. “The documentary will also highlight her collaborative relationship with Kanye West, focusing on how their creative partnership drives innovation across various fields. While both have kept much of their work under wraps,” it goes on, suggesting a metaphorical fur coat is about to be dropped by both Wests, “this series will offer unprecedented access to their joint creative processes, revealing how Bianca’s architectural sensibility influences Kanye’s futuristic fashion designs.” Righto. The network/streamer on which you’ll be able to view this remains tantalisingly unconfirmed. But I think I’d be more interested in it thanMeghan’s upcoming tablescaping debuton Netflix, if that means anything.In the end, though, the Kanye and Bianca show seems not a lot more than a bi-weekly occasion for drawing attention to staggering creative decline. For someone whose music was once layered and groundbreaking – and look, for someone whose architecture might well have also been layered and groundbreaking – the message of this now fairly long-running exercise in minimal dressing seems embarrassingly pedestrian, based on a somewhat teenage belief that sex is oo-er-rude and transgressive. As an art project, what is its point supposed to be? No offence, but it has about as much depth and nuance as a Banksy or late-stage Damien Hirst – in fact, it makes the actorSydney Sweeney’s funny snapof herself in a grey sweatshirt reading “Sorry for having great tits and correct opinions” look like a Renoir.As for where the show goes next, I have suspected for a while now that one future staging post on this provocative artistic journey will be for Bianca to appear on some red carpet or other wearing a full-body veil, while Kanye remains nice and comfy in his customary T-shirt and trousers. Should this development be realised, it’s hard to know whether people will find it offensively shocking, finally sufficiently modest, or coercive in a different manner. It’ll definitely be a lot harder for them to talk about in the “right” way than nudity is, though. In fact, judging by the full chatterati meltdown over Bianca and Kanye’sGrammysouting, the choice or otherwise of nudity remains much more acceptable to discuss than the choice or otherwise of being fully covered. Perhaps Mr and Mrs West have accidentally made an interesting point after all.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Gene therapy could be a lifeline, if it’s accessible to allTobi Oredein is a journalist, public speaker and the founder and CEO of Black BalladTue 4 Feb 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2025 12.02 ESTShareWhen I was pregnant for the first time in 2020, I remember saying to my husband: “This country does not give a toss about the health of black people.” Why? As a pregnant woman and a sickle cell carrier, I was shocked to learn how little information is shared about this disease. Logging into pregnancy apps or readingNHSleaflets, you find an endless list of illnesses and conditions – genetic and non-genetic – that may affect your baby. Yet sickle cell was barely mentioned, despite it being the fastest-growing genetic disease in the UK.During the pandemic, we were constantly told that those with underlying health conditions were more at risk. But sickle cell was rarely, if ever, acknowledged as one of those conditions.Sickle cell disease– which predominantly affects black people – causes red blood cells to become a sickle shape, making it difficult for them to pass through blood vessels. This leads to excruciating pain episodes, known as sickle cell crises, which can last hours, days or even weeks.But now there are shoots of hope that maybe that tide is turning. The NHS has recently approved agroundbreaking gene therapy for sickle cell disease– a treatment that won’t just help patients manage symptoms but could cure them of this crippling illness altogether. This new treatment is being hailed as a historic moment in medical history. And for good reason.Sickle cell affects people’s everyday lives in ways many of us never have to think about – something as simple as a change in temperature can trigger a crisis. Extreme weather conditions – being too cold or too hot – can send a patient into agonising pain. Cold weather narrows blood vessels, increasing the chances of a crisis, while extreme heat can lead to dehydration, worsening sickle cell symptoms. Many of us take these seasonal shifts for granted, but for sickle cell sufferers, winter and summer can be dangerous. Even something as routine as booking a holiday requires careful planning. What happens if you have a crisis abroad, in a country where language barriers make it hard to explain your condition? Or where doctors aren’t familiar with sickle cell and don’t know how to treat it properly?Then there’s the workplace. Some people hide their condition from employers, fearing it will affect their chances of getting hired. And let’s not forget how sickle cell can even restrict who you can date and build a family with, as carriers and those with the full-blown disease have to consider the risk of passing it on to their children. For me, as a carrier, there was a sense of relief in knowing that my husband doesn’t have the sickle cell gene. This meant there was no chance of our children having the disease – the only possibility was that, like me, they would be carriers, which they both are. This gene therapy could eradicate these problems.This medical breakthrough for sickle cell also represents something bigger for black people. Yes, black people have been living with sickle cell for decades, yet the medical system’s response has been shockingly slow. Unlike other conditions that receive extensive research funding and high-profile campaigns, sickle cell has always felt like an afterthought. And let’s not pretend that race doesn’t play a role in that. Black people have worse health outcomes across the board – frommental healthtomaternity care. Add in the fictitious and sometimes fatal belief among healthcare staff that black people have ahigher pain threshold, and it becomes clearer why sickle cell has been so low on the list of medical priorities.But does investment in this treatment signal a new dawn for the treatment of black patients? Perhaps. There is no doubt that the announcement of this new treatment for sickle cell has the potential to be a monumental step forward. But it also raises important questions and concerns. This treatment will only be truly effective if the healthcare system ensures thatracial biasesno longer prevent black people from accessing the medical care they deserve.While we can’t deny the potential of this gene therapy, it is vital the people who need it will be able to have access to it. We know there is a higher concentration of black people living in London. Most sickle cell treatment centres are in London and other big cities – so what happens to those outside these areas? Will they face longer waiting times? If so, while this treatment is curing some, others will be left falling further behind simply because of where they live.Furthermore, medical innovations need consistent funding. My hope is that the NHS remains committed to funding this life-changing gene therapy – and that financial pressures don’t lead to cuts before it reaches all who need it. For now, the approval of gene therapy brings hope. But the real test will be whether it delivers on its promise.Tobi Oredein is a journalist, public speaker and the founder and CEO of Black BalladDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In 2005, the Russian government paid him $13bn for Sibneft, to buy back, at huge profit to him, the oil company he’d paid them just $250m for 10 years earlier. He used that windfall to expand his luxury property portfolio and art collection and poured money into Chelsea FC. But it was the less high-profile investments that absorbed the majority of the cash, including about 200 hedge funds with complex corporate structures almost always involving theBritish Virgin Islands(BVI).An investigation by the Guardian, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the BBC, published last week, revealed how Abramovich may haveexploited Britain’s offshore havens to funnel wealth through Cyprus to the BVI and dodge up to £1bn in UK tax. That sum exceeds even Bernie Ecclestone’s historic tax settlement.The BVI has for years been the global destination of choice for those seeking maximum secrecy for their money, often tax dodgers and kleptocrats. The territory has featured prominently in global money-laundering investigations, including the 2016 Panama Papers leak, where half of the exposed entities were linked to it.British Virgin Islands accused of ‘shameful’ attempt to avoid financial crime crackdownRead moreI lead a walking tour in my constituency of Kensington and Bayswater as part of a local campaign against dirty money. We have more than 6,000 properties owned by overseas entities, more of which are based in this tiny Caribbean island of just over 30,000 people than anywhere else. The corporate vehicle of choice is an anonymous trust, with the owners shielded entirely from the public eye despite new transparency measures introduced after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 to try to reveal who really owns property in Britain. A recent Transparency International UK investigation found that £5.5bn of suspicious funds had entered the UK property market via BVI shell companies and trusts.Now, new proposals from the BVI government threaten to thwart the British government’s anti-corruption goals. Instead of increasing transparency, the BVI’s latest measures would block access to vital beneficial ownership data for journalists, civil society organisations and businesses – unless they are already party to a legal or regulatory case. This is despite the territory’s assurances at a summit with the British government last year that it would introduce registers of beneficial ownership to provide “maximum possible access and transparency” while protecting privacy. Make no mistake about it: the BVI’s suggested measures don’t protect businesses or privacy— they protect criminals.Roman Abramovich’s tax affairs must be investigated, MPs sayRead moreOne provision would even allow company owners to be notified not only that someone is attempting to uncover their identity, but also who is making the request and why, putting investigative journalists and anti-corruption activists at immediate risk of legal or physical intimidation. Worse still, this warning system could tip off criminals, giving them a head start to move illicit assets before enforcement agencies can act.The BVI’s proposals are not just woefully inadequate – they make a mockery of the foreign secretary’s commitment to make the UK the anti-corruption capital of the world.That is why a cross-party group of MPs has written to the BVI premier this week to express serious concerns about the failure to implement meaningful corporate transparency reforms. Parliament will now consider this issue as a matter of urgency on Wednesday 5 February. If our overseas territories refuse to accept the will of parliament, we must use our powers to ensure they do.There is a simple tool that would shine a light on the suspicious activity in the BVI and act as a deterrent to those seeking to use secrecy to avoid scrutiny. Full public registers of who owns companies are the most effective tool against illicit finance, enabling authorities to track ownership, follow the money and expose wrongdoing. If implemented, they would end decades of secrecy in these havens.People are rightly outraged that, while ordinary taxpayers shoulder their fair share, oligarchs and kleptocrats exploit the British overseas territories to shirk their obligations – especially at a time when public finances are under immense strain. It’s time the BVI opened up their books and let the sunlight in.Joe Powell is the MP for Kensington and Bayswater andchair of the all-party parliamentary group on anti-corruptionand responsible taxExplore more on these topicsBritish Virgin IslandsTax havensCorporate governancecommentShareReuse this content"

Trump increases his power bydemonstratinghe has the power and is willing to use it.The same with deporting, say, Colombians in military planes, handcuffed and shackled. Trump says, without any basis in fact, that they’re criminals.If Colombia complains about their treatment, so much the better. Trump threatens tariffs. Colombia backs down, and Trump has once again demonstrated his power.Why did Trump stop foreign aid? Not because it’s wasteful. In fact, it helps stabilize the world and reduces the spread of communicable diseases. The real reason Trump stopped foreign aid is he wants to show hecan.Why is he disregarding or threatening to tear up treaties and agreements (the Paris agreement, Nato, whatever)? Not because such treaties and agreements are bad for America. To the contrary, they’re in the US’s best interest.The reason Trump is tearing them up is they tie Trump’s hands and thereby limit his discretion to dish out punishments and rewards.Don’t think of these as individual “policies”. Think of them together as demonstrations of Trump’s strength.If he doesn’t reach a deal with Canada or Mexico over the next 30 days and one or both retaliate against US-imposed tariffs with their own tariffs on US exports, he’ll retaliate against them with even bigger tariffs.If some senior Republican members of Congress object that he’s stepping on congressional prerogatives, so what? It’s an opportunity to show them who’s boss.If a federal court temporarily stops him, so what? He’ll go right on doing it and demonstrate that the courts are powerless to stop him.Look behind what’s happening, and you’ll see Trump employing two techniques to gain more power than any US president has ever wielded.The first is to demonstrate that he can mete out huge punishments and rewards.It doesn’t matter if the punishment or reward is justified. A 25% tariff onCanada?Hello?It’s a demonstration of strength.If prices jump in the US for oil and lumber from Canada or for fruits and vegetables from Mexico, no problem for Trump. Most Americans don’t understand how tariffs work, anyway. Trump will blame Canada and Mexico. And then threaten them with, say, 50% tariffs. Kaboom!Which brings us to the second technique Trump is using to expand his power:unpredictability.What makes an abusive parent or spouse, or an abusive dictator, or Trump, especially terrifying? They’re unpredictable. They lash out in ways that are hard to anticipate.So, anyone potentially affected by their actions gives them extra-wide berth – vast amounts of obedience in advance.Trump keeps everyone guessing.He demands Denmark sell Greenland to the United States. He chews out the CEO of the Bank of America at Davos for allegedly discriminating against conservatives. He attacks birthright citizenship.What’s next? Who knows? That’s the wholepoint.How else to explain the bizarre deference – cowardice – we’re seeing among CEOs, the media, almost all Republican and even some Democratic lawmakers? Presumably, they’re all saying to themselves: “He could doanything,so let’s beespeciallycareful.”In 1517, Niccolò Machiavelli argued that sometimes it is “a very wise thing to simulate madness”.The “rule of law” is all about predictability. We need predictability to be free.But much of what Trump is doing is probably either illegal yet would require months or years before the US supreme court decides so, or is in the gray area of “probably illegal but untested by the courts”. Which suits his strategy just fine.The media calls it “chaos”, which is how various people and institutions experience it.The practical consequence is that an increasing number of so-called “leaders” – in the private, public and non-profit sectors, and around the world – are telling their boards, overseers, trustees or legislatures: “We have to give Trump whatever he wants and even try to anticipate his wants, because who knows how he’ll react if we don’t?”Together, these two techniques – big demonstrations of discretionary power to reward or punish, and wild uncertainty about when or how he’ll do so – expand Trump’s power beyond the point any president has ever pushed it.Which brings us to the obvious question: why is Trump so obsessed with enlarging his power?Hint: it’s not about improving the wellbeing of average Americans and certainly not about making America great again (whatever that means).True, he’s a malignant narcissist and sadist with an insatiable lust for power who gets pleasure out of making others squirm.But there’s something else.The bigger his demonstrable power and the more unpredictably he wields it, the greater his ability totradesome of that power with people with huge amounts of wealth, both in the United States and elsewhere.I’m referring to America’s billionaires, such as Elon Musk and the 13 other billionaires Trump has installed in his regime, as well as the 744 other billionaires in the US, and the 9,850 Americans with at least $100m in net worth.Together, these individuals have a huge storehouse of wealth. Many are willing to trade some of it to gain even more, and to tie down what they have more securely.They give Trump (and his family) business deals, information, campaign money and positive PR (propaganda). In return, he gives them tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and suspensions of antitrust.I’m also referring to oligarchs in Russia,Chinaand Saudi Arabia. He gives them special trade deals, energy deals, intelligence deals, access to global deposits of riches;orhe threatens to hold them back. In return, they give him (and his family) business deals, information, support in political campaignsand more covert propaganda.This is Trump’s game: huge demonstrations of power, wielded unpredictably. They’re eliciting extraordinary deals for Trump and his family, domestically and worldwide.Trump says he’s doing this for American workers. Nothing could be farther from the truth. He’s doing this for himself and for the world’s oligarchy, which, in turn, is busily siphoning off the wealth of the world.How to stop this? The first step is to understand it.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few and The Common Good.

Diageo, the Guinness, Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff combo, was able to cite “the current macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty” – exhibit A being the possible US tariffs on Canada and Mexico – asit dropped its guidance for growth.What that reasonable-sounding explanation misses, however, is that nobody believed Diageo’s old forecasts anyway – and they hadn’t for a long time before Trump re-entered the White House.The company’s longstanding “medium-term” range of 5% to 7% for organic sales growth was achieved in 2022-23, but it has looked fanciful ever since the newish chief executive, Debra Crew, issueda thumping profits warning in November 2023.A 1% improvement in sales in Tuesday’s half-year numbers was a return to growth but, tariffs or not, the credibility of 5% to 7% had gone. The target would have been dropped anyway. Better to issue no guidance than to allow “in the medium-term” to mean “at some point in the future, maybe”.None of which is to deny that Trump’s actions genuinely inject fresh uncertainty. The biggie for Diageo would be tequila out of Mexico, where its leading brand is Don Julio. Throw in Canadian whisky and you’re talking a theoretical $200m (£160m) hit to operating profits in four months under 25% tariffs, reckons the firm’s finance director, Nik Jhangiani.In practice, he says, Diageo could take actions to offset 40% of the impact before it had to consider price increases. And, depending on how the tariff rules are written, Monday’s one-month reprieve may offer a chance to get extra bottles of tequila over the border, sharpish.In the end, though, three things can be said about tariffs as they relate to drinks companies. First, they’re obviously bad news, and Diageo is more exposed than most. Second, the costs eventually get absorbed into higher prices, as with sugar taxes. Third, everybody is disadvantaged when it comes to products such as tequila. If it’s not out of Mexico, it’s not the real deal.The stock market, weighing it all up, decided there was nothing in Tuesday’s report to interrupt the decline in Diageo’s share price. The stock, having touched £40 during the post-pandemic party days of early 2022, lost another 1.6% to close at £23.27. It’s been quite a comedown.At the bottom of the Guinness glass there were, perhaps, reasons for investors to think it may not get worse from here. The distribution mistakes that led to over-stocking in Latin America – the cause of the confidence-sapping 2023 warning – seem to have been addressed. The group is still gaining a bit of market share globally.Guinness itself is on a flyer (which is why it was good that management knocked downtales of a disposal). And worries about the balance sheet may lessen now that there’s a plan to get serious about working capital in an industry where stocks of Scotch whisky, for example, can take a decade or two to mature.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is about the timing of recovery. Whether it is forecast or not, shareholders expect the long wait to end soon-ish.

My subject was not a theoretical physician, a note at the end politely explained, but a theoretical physicist. Ten years later, it still makes me shudder.Still, I felt a little better about it when I saw the run that Apple’s artificial intelligence system went on recently. In its automated summaries of news notifications sent out to some iPhones, it asserted that Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing the UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, had shot himself. It said that Benjamin Netanyahu had been arrested. It said that Pete Hegseth, not then confirmed as Donald Trump’s secretary of defense, had resigned. And it said thatRafael Nadal was gay. For the avoidance of doubt: he didn’t, he wasn’t, he hadn’t and he isn’t.This litany of howlers were the product of the Apple Intelligence AI system, which was rolled out across the company’s recent phones in the UK in December. There was no way for publishers to opt out, and an inscrutable little arrow next to the source news organisation’s logo was the only marker that this was Apple Intelligence’s output, rather than their own. After the BBC ran a series of richly indignant news stories about the phenomenon, Apple did something it almost never does: it reversed course, andpaused the service. (Full disclosure: my wife works for Apple.)You could see why Apple pulled the plug: the story was funny and weird enough to get traction. Saying, as another of the summaries did, that Luke Littler had won the darts world championship final before he’d actually played in it, isthe six-fingered handof news events: something that almost looks real, but reveals itself as fatally and hilariously flawed if you pay close enough attention. If it had been up and running last summer, you dread to think what the summarising process might have done to the news of the assassination attempt against Donald Trump.How DeepSeek stunned the AI industry – podcastRead moreStill, the central dynamic here is of two implacably opposed cultures: one that embraces public iteration, and the many missteps that users will endure along the way; and one which knows that if it keeps getting things wrong, the whole point of its existence will be annulled. There’s no realistic way to reconcile these tendencies, but you might think a journalistic carve-out would be a grownup solution.We can’t expectAppleIntelligence to shudder when it reflects on these errors, because it doesn’t actually comprehend what a fact is – it just knows what one sounds like. What’s perhaps more alarming is the view from the other end of the telescope: that we might very easily not have known about these mistakes, and that there were almost certainly many others that went entirely unnoticed.All of this came to light only because journalists – at the BBC, but alsoProPublicaand the Washington Post – happened to receive the alerts in question. The summaries were locally generated on users’ phones, and Apple has no way to track them. That means that it is very likely that other users will have received inaccurate alerts, and blamed them on journalistic incompetence rather than a bot gone wild – or quite reasonably believed them to be true. There are probably still iPhone users roaming the streets under the impression that Father Christmas gave the king’s speech, or whatever.The BBC wasn’t the only news organisation to notice the problem, but it was the only one to really go after it publicly.The vigour of its coveragewas partly a submerged message to readers. “It didn’t hurt that it let people know that if they were seeing this, it wasn’t the BBC doing it,” one journalist there says. “But it was also about drawing a line in the sand with Apple and saying – look, this looks like it comes from us, and our reputation is completely founded on being reliable.”Some might scoff at this, and point out that news organisations make their own mistakes all the time – more consequential than my physicist/physician howler, if less humiliating. But cases of bad journalism are almost always warped representations of the real world, rather than missives from an imaginary one. Crucially, if an outlet gets big things wrong a lot, its reputation will suffer, and its audience are likely to vote with their feet, or other people will publish stories that air the mistake. And all of it will be out in the open.You may also note that journalists are increasingly likely to use AI in the production of stories – and there is no doubt that it is a phenomenally powerful tool, allowing investigative reporters tofind patterns in vast financial datasetsthat reveal corruption, or analyse satellite imagery forevidence of bombing attacksin areas designated safe for civilians. There is a legitimate debate over the extent of disclosure required in such cases: on the one hand, if the inputs and outputs are being properly vetted, it might be a bit like flagging the use of Excel; on the other, AI is still new enough that readers may expect you to err on the side of caution. Still, the fundamental difference is not in what you’re telling your audience, but what degree of supervision you’re exercising over the machine.In the end, the most telling part of all this may be Apple’s reaction. Even if it stonewalled for a month after the BBC’s first story, it is striking that a company with a longstanding reputation for defensiveness ultimately relented. But it will undoubtedly bring the product back, and it has not said where the bar is for accuracy that it will consider sufficient.Apple suspends AI-generated news alert service after BBC complaintRead moreThe really interesting question is why Apple made its use of AI in these summaries so invisible – if only there were two letters representing the technology that might easily be assembled into a legible icon! It’s a small detail, in one sense. But it also points to a much larger problem: when you’re dealing with the introduction of a revolutionary new technology that your users don’t really understand, adhering to your defining mission for simplicity may make things pretty complicated.The truth is, even if Apple is less thoroughly defined as an AI business than some of its big tech rivals, it is nevertheless a participant in a gold rush. The AI products that stick with us over the next few years may be a bit like the Qwerty keyboard against various alternatives, or Internet Explorer’s victory over Netscape: worse, but ultimately victorious because of their unconquerable scale. If so, a frictionless experience might be a very effective strategy.If the complaints of even the most venerable news outlets are part of the price, it won’t even touch the sides. In its latest software update last week, the same one that disabled the news summaries,Apple turned on AI by defaultfor the first time.Archie Bland is the editor of the Guardian’sFirst EditionnewsletterExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionAppleBBCDigital mediacommentShareReuse this content"

There is an answer, but it involves improving human behaviourTue 4 Feb 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2025 06.54 ESTShareCall it a tale of two puppies. You can tell a lot about 2020s Britain by looking at its two defining “designer” dogs: the cavapoo (or spoodle, or any of the other poodle-crosses), and the American XL bully.Both took off in popularity with a surge in dog ownershipduring the pandemic, promptingunscrupulous breedersto cash in on the demand; and both have been widely bred to prioritise appearance over good character or health. And, in their cartoonish contrast, both might be seen as emblematic of where our relationship with dogs has in recent decades gone awry. One is treated to puppuccinos and trips to the pub, while the other has been demonised as a killing machine.Saturday marked 12 months since it becamea criminal offenceto own an XL bully (without a certificate of exemption) in England and Wales. Legislation waspassed in December 2023, after a disturbing spate of serious attacks and fatalities. Now it is illegal to buy, sell, rehome, abandon or breed dogs of that type, while exempted dogs must be muzzled and leashed when outside the home.Hundreds of XL bullieshave been put down since the ban, and more than 55,000were grantedexemption certificates, reflecting the effort made to accommodate responsible owners. The question now is whether the public is more safe as a result. Of the nine fatal dog attacksreported in England and Walessince the ban was introduced, five involved XL bullies – but all occurred in private homes.If the ban protects even one person from harm, it has arguably been worth it. Twelve months in, however, there is not yet enough data to know, while the ban has clearlycaused confusionand createdextra work for police, vets and animal welfare organisations. Meanwhile, dogs attacks (by any type or breed) havecontinued to rise. This is not necessarily a surprise: bites resulting in hospitalisations have been rising steadilysince 1998, despite the Dangerous Dogs Act.Ban on XL bully dogs a ‘huge burden on policing’, force chiefs warnRead moreIt demonstrates the law’s serious limitations in tackling the overall public health threat posed by dogs. Animal welfare organisations, veterinary bodies and experts have long opposed breed-specific legislation on the grounds thatbreed is not a robust predictorof aggression.This focus on type(often boiling down, in practice, to how a dog looks) is not only misleading and unfair; it distracts from other measures that might effectively reduce bites and promote dog-human harmony overall, such asgenetic testingto identify animals with an inherited risk of aggression.In 2023, the government establisheda responsible dog ownership working group to explore how the UK might switch to a preventive approach, focusing on “deed, not breed” – but a source from that group told me that that preventative work lost all momentum with the debate over XL bullies, and has not recommenced with the new government. By seeming to act conclusively against the issue of “dangerous dogs”, the XL bully ban has cut short a much-needed discussion about dog control and ownership. Under the current approach, we don’t even understand the scale of dog bites and which breeds are actually responsible, let alone their triggers or causal factors.Groups on both sides are continuing to call for more detailed, centralised data-keeping on dog attacks to allow for analysis and evidence-based prevention. In the meantime, the XL bully ban may put owners, their family members and visitors to their homes at greater risk.David Martin, the head of animal welfare at the corporate veterinary group IVC Evidensia, says vets are concerned that exempted dogs – required to be leashed in public – are not receiving sufficient exercise, potentially leading to behavioural issues. Muzzles also exacerbate heat stress, another risk factor for aggression. If there’s a heatwave this summer, “we may run into issues”, Martin says. Meanwhile, the demand for large, intimidating “status dogs” has reportedly shifted to the cane corso and anatolian and caucasian shepherd dogs, just as the XL bully superseded the pit bull. In five years, will we be banning those, too?View image in fullscreenA cavapoo outside a polling station on election day in Eton Wick, Berkshire, 4 July 2024.Photograph: Maureen McLean/Rex/ShutterstockWe can continue playing whack-a-mole with different dog breeds, only after serious attacks – or we can take a step back, and reckon with where this relationship is going wrong. In recent decades, andparticularly since the pandemic, dogs have shifted from companions to commodities. The result is a dwindling acknowledgment of what all dogs need to live harmoniously alongside humans – sufficient daily exercise, socialisation, consistency, routine, respect – and haphazard commitment to providing it.A recentRSPCA report makesa host of recommendations to improve dog control and promote “a culture of care and compliance”, including ownership licensing, accreditation for trainers and public education campaigns on how to recognise signs of aggression. Above all, it describes the need for “attitudinal, behavioural and cultural change”, whereby all dog owners – not just those of controversial breeds – “understand how to appropriately and effectively acquire, care for and control” their pets.Certainly, that will be different for a cavapoo and an XL bully – but the consistent baseline should be respect for them as animals, and for their animal instincts. If we are serious about preventing attacks and fatalities, we can’t just keep sorting “good” breeds from “bad” as though we have no part in their actions or behaviour. Though we may treat them as status symbols, substitute children, soft toys or testosterone-boosters, dogs will be dogs. If you want to improve control, start by looking at ownership.Elle Hunt is a freelance journalistExplore more on these topicsDangerous dogsOpinionAnimalsDogsPetscommentShareReuse this content"

The right has dominated theory, bolstered by a supportive press, yet struggled in execution. Meanwhile, Labour has become pragmatic but uninspiring, clinging to a “leftwing” label while prioritising competence over vision. That may not be a flaw in itself, butpollingsuggests it isn’t winning over voters.Yet Labour’s poor standing hasn’t benefited the Tories. Broken by their time in office, the Conservatives appear to be fading into irrelevance. They failed to address capitalism’s central flaw: that without government intervention, wealth accumulates for those at the top while many feel abandoned below. Instead, Tory chancellors pursuedausteritypolicies, deepening social division and fuelling the discontent that led to the disaster of voting toleave the EU.This week,Sir Keir Starmerbecame the first British leader to attend a European Council meeting since Brexit. The paradox for Labour is that closer ties with the EU would benefit Britain and are increasingly popular, yet they also reinforce the perception that Labour represents the status quo, aligning it semaphorically with high immigration levels. This plays into Nigel Farage’s hands.Mr Farage, despite being central to Brexit’s ongoing damage, has escaped blame. Never having been in government, the former City trader continues to pose as ananti-establishment insurgent. He has also hardened his anti-immigration stance, keeping the issue central to his politics. His rise reflects a broader truth: voters don’t always punish failure – they vote based on identity and frustration. Mr Farage exploits this today by arguing Brexit wassabotagedby the political class, not by its obvious contradictions.On Tuesday, a pollshowedMr Farage’s Reform UK overtaking Labour as Britain’s most popular party. This is despite his long history ofinflammatoryrhetoric. Elections often change who holds power, but not necessarily the direction of policy. Across Europe, the populist right is weaponising climate action, portraying green policies as elite-driven burdens on working people. Mr Farage has seized on this,callingfor the scrapping of net zero targets. The Conservatives, under Kemi Badenoch,seempoised to follow.Rather than inspiring confidence, Labour offers false reassurance – implying that little will change. This leads to contradictory messaging, such as suggesting that flying from Heathrow will be easier while continuingNorth Sea oil exploration, without addressing how these would meet Britain’s carbon commitments. Just as troubling is Labour’swelfarereform plan, which focuses on tackling benefit fraud. In attempting to shield itself from rightwing attacks, Labour risks hurting vulnerable individuals anddisproportionatelytargeting benefit claimants while larger-scale fraud goes unaddressed. It also taps into a narrative that ultimately echoes Reform’s own rhetoric about “scroungers”.Political justifications shift depending on who benefits. Brexit was once a people’s revolution, then an unchallengeable mandate. Now that it’sunpopular, politicians avoid reopening the debate. But the shadow of Brexit will not fade on its own. Labour cannot simply manage the status quo. To defeat Mr Farage’s sham politics, it must offer more than technocratic governance. Without a compelling vision, including one for Britain’s place in Europe, it risks being outflanked – both by history and by a movement built on anger, not solutions.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Their grudging experiment with limited democracy reached its end when Aung San Suu Kyi’s party won a landslide second election victory – prompting the ousting and imprisonment of the National League for Democracy (NLD) leader and her colleagues in February 2021.Four years on, resistance has flourished. A study by the BBCestimatesthat the junta controls only 21% of Myanmar’s territory as it battles People’s Defence Force units set up by the national unity government formed from the NLD’s remnants, as well as the ethnic armed groups that have long fought Naypyidaw. More than 4 million people are displaced and half the population has been forced into poverty. Less than half has access to electricity. The UNsaysRakhine state is at imminent risk of acute famine and Rohingya Muslims there are particularly vulnerable,trappedbetween the military – which hasforcibly conscriptedmen – and the Arakan Army, which accuses them of siding with the junta.The military still holds the major cities and the country’s heart. Itwill not be dislodged easily. But internal tensions are evident, with calls for its chief, Min Aung Hlaing, to quit. Among its losses are 95 towns, key trade routes, hundreds of military bases and two regional commands. Itsbrutal tacticsinclude sexual violence, mass killings and torture, as well as the relentless bombing of civilian sites. Any possibility of further restricting jet fuel supplies should be seized on.Astonishing rebel advances from late October 2023 were possible because China gave the nod to an alliance of ethnic armed groups, angered by the regime’s failure to control criminal groups on the border. Now it has cut off arms flows and other key imports, seeingthe junta’s survivalas its best hope of ensuring the resources and stability it seeks and of keeping out the US. Tellingly, it seems to be Beijing pressing hardest for elections this year. They would not only be a sham – with 21,000 political prisoners being held – but also farcical, if they are even achievable; opposition forces have pledged to disrupt them.Many in Myanmar have concluded that military rule is no longer an inevitability and that they cannot compromise with the junta, because it has shown it will not compromise with them. But even optimists acknowledge that it could take years to defeat it. There is concern that, with so many other crises worldwide, the international community could seize on token concessions by the junta and press for a deal.The Trump administration’s attacks on the National Endowment for Democracy are bad news for the civic groups that are aiding people now and that would be key to building a better Myanmar. Its freeze on USAid operations has already seenmedical care withdrawnfrom 100,000 refugees in Thailand. A modest UKincrease in healthcare fundingis welcome, and the EU and others should beef up aid, working withemerging administrationsin areas wrested from the military.Fears that a post-junta Myanmar could collapse completely, at further civilian cost, are not unfounded. Opposition groups too have committedgrave rights violations. They are deeply fragmented, with diverse and sometimes contradictory interests. Yet they have managed to cooperate surprisingly over the last four years. A different,federalvision for the country cannot and should not be written off.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Factors such as personal grievances, vulnerabilities, social media influence, a search for identity and a desire to belong all play a role. However, once they become involved, racism, hatred and intolerance quickly become deeply ingrained.It is important not to downplay the role of online disinformation, anti-immigrant sentiment, Islamophobia and racist views.Social mediawas flooded with images of children chanting racist and Islamophobic slogans, attacking those perceived to be Muslim, inciting community disorder and targeting mosques with violence. Downplaying this avoids the reality that the prevalent culture wars are feeding intolerance, hatred and prejudice towards anyone considered the other – in this case Muslims and immigrants.Far-right movements and sympathisers are exploiting anti-establishment sentiment, anger towards the police, the lack of youth opportunities and disempowered young people. I agree with Rachel de Souza, the children’s commissioner for England, that young people should not be criminalised, but rehabilitated. However, to tackle the root causes of the riots, we need a deeper understanding of the far-right ecosystem.My work has brought me into contact with former far-right sympathisers in the UK, North America and Europe, and it has led me to believe that, as a society, we have a responsibility to provide young people with the necessary interventions rather than vilify them. To tackle the many challenges facing them, we must reverse the systematic dismantling of youth provision. Only by empowering young people as active citizens can we begin to address the growing issues they face.Mohammed Ali AmlaTrustee, The Faith& Belief Forum; youth and partnerships director, Solutions Not SidesI am bewildered by the children’s commissioner’s conclusion, after her team interviewed 14 minors who took part in last August’s riots, that they were not motivated by the “prevailing narrative” of racism, but by anti-police feelings. Is it really a matter of dismantling prevailing narratives when 286 of the 1,804 people arrested in relation to the riots were minors? Is this meant to delude us into thinking that younger generations are growing up free from racial prejudice, unscathed by the Trump era of online misinformation?Any sigh of relief here would make us forget that racism is a systemic issue and that misinformation and fake news cause very real damage. The riots prove it: while people peacefully congregated to support the victims and families of theSouthport attack, another portion of Britain jumped off the unfounded claim that the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker to give vent to anti-immigration, Islamophobic and racist views.I must let my bewilderment loose, because only then can I recognise that these are scenes from a post-humane society, where unfounded, made-up statements shared online can drive crowds all over the country to chant “Out of our country” outside facilities hosting refugees.These riots were the deplorable face behind the equally deplorable yet legal mask that is populist politics, which others migrants, refugees, Muslims, non-white people. It’s being called “anti-immigration” to sell it as “national security”, but it is xenophobia, racism, Islamophobia and patriarchy. And it is appalling.Alice FlintaYorkDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers? If so, pleaseclick hereto upload it.

I didn’t know that such medications are full of insecticides.So I went to my vet and asked him if he could recommend any that didn’t contain pesticides. I may have imagined the slight tone of disbelief that I would even ask this, but the lack of curiosity was definitely there. He said: “We don’t do that sort of thing. You probably should just Google that.” If that is the prevailing attitude in veterinary practices in the UK, then songbirds have more problems to come.Anyway, I took his advice and I have bought some herbal flea repellant and herbal dewormer, and we will see how Bracken turns out.Karoline KupratLlanrhytsud, CeredigionFurther to your article about the fatal effect on songbird chicks of pesticides used in flea and tick treatments for pets, there is also the likely impact these chemicals will have on the many species of invertebrate that live in birds’ nests. Astudy by GE Woodroffein 1953 found 12 species of ectoparasite, 66 species of scavengers and 14 species of predatory invertebrates living in British birds’ nests. Doubtless many more such species have been identified since then.These creatures will probably be as directly sensitive to anti-flea preparations as the fleas they were intended to kill. Nest-dwelling invertebrates are invisible to most of us, but they are an intriguing and important element of the biodiversity of these islands. If the veterinary profession supports the preservation of biodiversity, it must consider the broadest implications of its prescribing practices and must start to educate pet owners about responsible use of pesticides.Roy SmithBurntwood, StaffordshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

A bid for Ollie Watkins, believed to have been worth around £40m,was rejected by Aston Villa last week, with Arsenal also deciding not to follow up their interest in the Bayern Munich forward Mathys Tel,who joined ­Tottenham on loaninstead.Eddie Howe tells Newcastle to ‘leave a legacy’ against Arsenal in Carabao CupRead moreArteta was at pains to point out that their lack of activity this month will putArsenalin a stronger financial position in the summer, when they are expected to renew their pursuit of the RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. But he also recognised that any more injury setbacks could leave them short for the final few months of the season.“We had a clear intention which is always there is a window open to explore the opportunities to improve our squad with players that can impact it,” Arteta said. “We haven’t achieved it so we are disappointed in that sense but as well we are very aware that we only want to bring ­certain kinds of players and we have to be very disciplined with that and I think we will.”Asked if he saw it as a gamble, Arteta said: “It’s not a gamble, it’s reality. I think we have to face the reality as well that we have. So we’re going to have to evolve there as well and have more and have more players from the academy and the ones that are here to be fitter longer.“That’s a job that is permanent and it keeps evolving and we need to be on our toes. We’re going to have to be very flexible in the front line and now the ones that we have and are fit, make sure that they stay fit and they keep contributing.”Kai Havertz is Arsenal’s only recog­nised centre-forward, although Arteta said Leandro Trossard, Raheem Sterling and Ethan Nwaneri – who turns 18 next month and needs only two more goals to match Wayne Rooney’s tally of nine senior goals before his 18th birthday – could also fill in. Arteta is hoping that Havertz’s fitness record means he can last the course this season.“He has played a lot of football but his robustness, his availability is unbelievable. When you ask him, he feels better when he is playing every three days. Against Girona for example, we gave him a rest. And then he felt fresher. He then had a very demanding game physically against Manchester City for the role that he had to do. We will see how they are. Players give you a lot of information but if you are playing well and scoring goals, all this helps.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On the other hand, it does not greatly stiffen England’s defence, as Bundee Aki underlined last Saturday. A rampant France,who won 53-10on their last visit to Twickenham two years ago, will not go easy on either England’s rookie fly-half or their makeshift full-back.Marcus Smith did fill in at full‑back for all but eight minutes of the match against France in Lyon last year, when England were edged out in a thrilling game. The England backs coach, Richard Wigglesworth, speaking at the team hotel in Bagshot, opted to sidestep direct selection questions but he sees no reason why the time to unite the Smiths cannot be now.View image in fullscreenEngland’s Fin Smith during a training session this week.Photograph: Adam Davy/PA“We’ve seen Marcus at 15 with George Ford and we’ve seen him with Fin,” Wigglesworth said. “He’s obviously another set of eyes that are very opportunistic. ‘Where’s the space? Who can I beat?’ Whether it is with George or with Fin, that’s what it would bring.“I think we are blessed with three 10s who can all play international rugby to a high level. Fin has had less chance than the rest at the moment, but he is really clear with his game. He is confident without being arrogant and wants to get better. He has all the things you associate with top 10s. He is really clear with what he wants and how to best position the team. I’ve been super impressed with him.“We’ve got some unbelievably talented younger boys, it’s just about us trying to up-speed them as quick as possible.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I feel like he sees it really well.“Obviously he’s a slightly different 10 to Marcus. Marcus has got that X‑factor in terms of beating a man one on one but I think Fin is very measured. He also speaks very well and, as I say, finds space very well. That’s a big part of a No 10’s role …moving the team around to where they need to be on the pitch. I think he’s been really good at that.“It can be tough being a younger guy coming up through. But I think the ones that do the best are the ones that really embrace it and have the confidence to speak up and show what gets them selected in the first place. And I think now, the way he speaks in meetings or when he is on the pitch, I think he feels really confident.”Wigglesworth, though, accepts that England did not help themselves in the second half against Ireland. “The penalty count did not help our ability to get out of our half and dictate what we wanted to do to Ireland,” the backs coach said. “For part of that second half it felt like we were trapped in our territory and couldn’t really get out.“We know it is going to be a big challenge [against France] but the feeling is excitement. We did some things really well in Dublin, the first half was brilliant, some of attack was really good. You have got to think positively in all situations and make sure we are clear in how we want to impose our game.”Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025England rugby union teamSteve BorthwickSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

It spoke not just of widespread recognition among Europe’s elite clubs of the 19‑year‑old’s quality but of a shift of policy in the Bundesliga leaders’ camp; from shutting their ears to all approaches at the beginning of January to accepting that leveraging a financial advantage out of the situation was the best they could do. A month-long transfer window leaves room for plenty of changes of heart and mind.Some will snort that Tottenham were a mere backup choice after Tel declined their initial approach, that the forward blinked when faced with the prospect of a second half of theBundesligaseason like his first, given a mere 253 minutes of playing time. More probable is that an especially reflective young man took time to think of what would work best for him rather than what would most suit Bayern. There is little contradictory about the process when you consider Tel is an explosive attacking weapon with the maturity to constantly adapt.Transfer window verdict: how every Premier League club faredRead moreFiercely ambitious yet humble. Enormously confident in his ability yet grounded. Surrounded by close family after Bayern games, but not stuck in his bubble; when L’Équipe sent a journalist to Munich to interview Tel at the club’s Säbener Strasse training centre last year, the young forward arrived to greet him with a smile on his face and a box full of pastries fresh from a local French patisserie.And frustrated, without doubt, by being the perpetual understudy to Harry Kane but never less than grateful for everything he has been able to learn in the past 17 months from the England captain, who has a high regard for Tel. Backing up Kane, the hyper-reliable superstar who never rests, must be the most infuriating role in world football for a youngster with talent to burn and a barely containable desire to improve. It has also led to Tel being slightly miscast.You may have already read descriptions ofTottenham’s new manas a winger. His natural gifts – and Kane’s natural indefatigability – may have frequently pushed Tel out wide, but sometimes his natural abilities suggest he is something that perhaps he is not. The pace, the ability to take on defenders and the intelligence to find the right pass for a teammate make him perfect winger material. It’s just, most of the time, that he’s only in these positions to fit around Kane.View image in fullscreenMathys Tel signed for Tottenham on deadline day with an option to buy over the summer.Photograph: Alex Morton/Tottenham Hotspur FC/ShutterstockMaybe, in time, the way in which Tel has broadened his palette could be considered a belated parting gift from the England captain to his old club. The France Under-21 player’s first instinct has always been to shoot, with the power he has in either foot. Within weeks of Tel’s arrival in Bavaria, Thomas Müller heralded him as “an unbelievable finisher”. That ability to take chances is borne out by his tally of 10 goals last season, despite being given only nine starts across the Bundesliga, DFB‑Pokal and Champions League, with Thomas Tuchel building on Julian Nagelsmann’s experiments in sending Tel on in the closing stages to voraciously attack weary defences.Yet the really interesting statistic is the six assists that accompany the goals. Rather than having a desperation to catch the coach’s attention with a spectacular individual contribution, Tel regularly underlined his wit and humility to do what the team needed. Take the Champions League win against Galatasaray in November 2023. One-on-one with his future Bayern teammate Sacha Boey, he might have been tempted to cut in and get a shot off to make his mark. Instead, he set up Kane with a precise first‑time pass for an easy tap-in to ice a devilishly difficult game.That ability and versatility should come as no surprise, given that Tel is from impeccable footballing stock. He was born in the suburbs of Paris but is a graduate of the elite academy production line at Rennes, which has produced players including Yoann Gourcuff, Sylvain Wiltord, Yann M’Vila, Ousmane Dembélé and Eduardo Camavinga. It was Camavinga’s record that Tel broke in August 2021 when he became the youngest player to turn out for Rennes, at 16 years, three months and 19 days. A year later (after a €28.5m transfer) he became Bayern’s youngest scorer, in a Pokal win against Viktoria Köln, eclipsing Jamal Musiala.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Whereas Tuchel planned to leave Kane out of games in the Pokal, Germany’s national cup competition, the new coach started Kane at Mainz in late October. Tel entered in Kane’s stead at half-time with Bayern 4-0 up – garbage time, as it would be framed in basketball. The logjam in wide areas – with Leroy Sané, a revitalised Kingsley Coman, the arrival of Michael Olise and sometimes Musiala competing for roles – has left little room for Tel elsewhere in the team.So off to Tottenham he goes and, whether by accident or design, it feels like the perfect destination. With his preference to play at centre-forward or in the corridor between the centre and the left (a little like his more senior compatriot Kylian Mbappé), the picture appears all set up for Tel to provide Spurs with a succession plan for Son Heung-min. He can contribute in the short term and have the team built around him next. By choosing to leave Bayern, Tel has underlined that he considers now to be his time.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurBayern MunichBundesligaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His remarks came just over a week after the refereeMichael Oliver received death threatsafter an apparent error in a match.Time to blow the whistle on abuse of football referees | LettersRead moreScholes said of refereeing standards: “The feedback that I’m getting from clubs is that the vast majority recognised significant progress in this area. But that is also the case with other leagues around the world, where they all look up to the match officials in this country and indeed the VAR process and VAR officials in this country as a model that they would like to follow. Sometimes it doesn’t feel that way here in England, but that’s the message that I get from people around the world.”Twelve months ago Scholes admitted the implementation of VAR had been“nowhere near good enough”but this year he returned with a more positive message. Scholes said there had been 64 errors made by referees in key match incidents this season, up to and including game week 23, down from 80 over the same period a year ago. There were 70 VAR interventions during that time, with 66 correctly overturning a decision.“That’s less than one intervention in three games, which shows that the interference of the VAR is perhaps not at the level that many of us perceive it is,” Scholes said. “We should also recognise that the number of VAR errors has gone down substantially from 20 to 13 too.“I stress to clubs all the time that nobody here underestimates the significance and the impact of one single error. We know it can cost clubs points, can cost them results, can cost managers [their] positions potentially.“It’s absolutely right that we continue to push these officials to be as good as they can be. But it’s also right that we acknowledge the progress that has been made, because we do not get the best performance out of people if we are constantly criticising, constantly beating [people] up over errors made. It’s right we should acknowledge the progress.”Scholes confirmed that the length of VAR delays had also come down from more than a minute per match in the 2023-24 season to 40 seconds. It is a reduction that has occurred without semi-automated offside technology (SOAT), which had been expected to be implemented before Christmas but has met with problems in testing.“We are making significant progress,” Scholes said of SAOT. “I have to confess given the difficulties that we had over the first few months of the season, I had severe doubts about this but we’ve made a lot of progress in this area now. We believe we’re going to be adopting the best system and the most accurate system. I’m hopeful that at some point this season we will be able to introduce SAOT technology, but I repeat the point made a number of times: we are not going to introduce it if we’ve got any doubts at all with regard to its operation.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said her comments had left him “shocked, upset and humiliated”. She denies the charges.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailDuring cross-examination on Tuesday, Kerr’s defence barrister, Grace Forbes, asked Lovell about this first statement, which was submitted on the day of the incident which occurred in the early hours of 30 January 2023. She put it to Lovell: “Your first statement made no mention of stupid and white having had an impact.”Lovell said it did not.She then accused Lovell of submitting a second statement in December 2023 “because the CPS declined to charge Kerr”, saying “only a year later did you make mention of these words having had an impact on you … The CPS identified there was no evidence of harassment, alarm or distress.

She replied: “I am aware that anything can be perceived as racist, for sure.”Kerr told Skinner that she would “apologise” to the officers for the “whole event”. “I wish I walked away and dealt with it in the morning, like I am now.

Buettner said he negotiated with Dvorkovich until the early hours of Monday, only to hear from the president that the Fide council would not agree to a deal.Wood Green and Manx Liberty take Four Nations Chess League down to the wireRead more“He should just go away. They’re a completely incompetent and amateur organisation,” German entrepreneur Buettner said on Tuesday.In messages exchanged with Henrik Carlsen, father and manager of the five-time classical chess champion, Dvorkovich wrote he would resign if players would be affected in any way by their participation in the Freestyle Chess Grand Slam tour, which starts in Weissenhaus, Germany, on Friday. “They can decide on their own and Fide will not take any negative action,” one of the messages read. “I will step down if my word will be undermined by the Council.”However, the Fide council said in a statement on Monday that players willing to take part in the series sign a “waiver note by 18:00 CET, February 4, 2025, to remain eligible for the official Fide World Championship cycle. We note that this document does not impose new requirements on the players but provides them with a one-off exception from their existing contractual obligations towards Fide.”“We removed any reference to the world championship on our website,” Buettner said. “We’re moving on, we’re leaving them in the dust. They gave us great PR.”Carlsen and Buettner, however, asked that Dvorkovich keep his promise even though the waiver “is not required any more”, the Fide CEO Emil Sutovsky said, after references to a “world championship” were removed from the Freestyle Chess Grand Slam’s website.“He said if I’m not getting the council’s approval I’m going to resign so where is the resignation,” Buettner said. On X, Carlsen wrote: “By forcing players to sign an unacceptable waiver you have reneged on your promise. Will you resign?”Chess960, created by the former world champion Bobby Fischer in 1996, has been gaining in popularity after an invitational tournament played last year at the Weissenhaus luxury resort, which hosted the G7 Foreign Minister summit in 2022.In Chess960/Freestyle chess, the pieces on the back rank are reshuffled, meaning that computer-backed preparations leading to sometimes dull openings, are meaningless. While Fide has organised World Fischer Random Championships in 2019 and 2022, they were played in rapid time control, and last year’s edition was cancelled.Explore more on these topicsChessMagnus CarlsennewsShareReuse this content"

If correct, they mean even worse extreme weather will come sooner and there is a greater risk of passing global tipping points, such as the collapse of the critical Atlantic ocean currents.Hansen, at Columbia University in the US, sounded the alarm to the general public about climate breakdown intestimony he gave to a UN congressional committeein 1988.“The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) defined a scenario which gives a 50% chance to keep warming under 2C – that scenario is now impossible,” he said. “The 2C target is dead, because the global energy use is rising, and it will continue to rise.”The new analysis said global heating is likely to reach 2C by 2045, unless solar geoengineering is deployed.The world’s nations pledged in Paris in 2015 to keep global temperature rise below 2C above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5C. The climate crisis has alreadysupercharged extreme weather across the worldwith just 1.3C of heating on average in recent years destroying lives and livelihoods – 2C would be far worse.Prof Jeffrey Sachs, also at Columbia University, said: “A shocking rise of warming has been exposed by, ironically, a reduction of pollutants, but we now have a new baseline and trajectory for where we are.”Climate scientistDr Zeke Hausfather, who was not part of the study, said it was a useful contribution. “It’s important to emphasise that both of these issues – [pollution cuts] and climate sensitivity – are areas of deep scientific uncertainty,” he said.“While Hansen et al are on the high end of available estimates, we cannot say with any confidence that they are wrong, rather that they just represent something closer to a worst-case outcome.”In the new study,published in the journal Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development, Hansen’s team said: “Failure to be realistic in climate assessment and failure to call out the fecklessness of current policies to stem global warming is not helpful to young people.”They said the IPCC analysis was heavily reliant on computer models and that the complementary approach they took of making more use of observations and climate analogues from the distant past was needed.The world has seenextraordinary temperatures over the last two years. The primary cause is therelentless risein CO2emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. The peak of the El Niño climate cycle in 2024 added an extra temperature boost.However, these two factors do not fully explain the extreme temperatures, or their persistence after the El Niño ended in mid-2024. This leftpuzzled climate scientistsasking if there was a worrying new factor not previously accounted for, or if the extra heat was an unusual but temporary natural variation.A key focus has been on emissions from shipping. For decades, the sulphate particles produced by ships burning fuel have blocked some sunlight from reaching the Earth’s surface, suppressing temperatures.But in 2020, new anti-pollution regulations came into force, sharply cutting the level of the aerosol particles. This led tomore heat from the sun reaching the surface, which scientists measure as watts per square metre (W/m2).Hansen’s team’s estimate of the impact of this – 0.5W/m2 – is significantly higher than five other recent studies, which ranged from 0.07 to 0.15 W/m2, but would explain the anomalous heat. Hansen’s team used a top-down approach, looking at the change in the reflectivity over key parts of the ocean and ascribing that to the reductions in shipping emissions. The other studies used bottom-up approaches to estimate the increase in heat.“Both approaches are useful and often complementary,” said Dr Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. “But I think in this case, Hansen’s approach is too simple and doesn’t factor in changes in Chinese emissions, or internal variability.”The new study also argues that the planet’s climate sensitivity to rising carbon emissions has been underestimated, partly because of the underestimation of the impact of reduced shipping emissions.Climate sensitivity is defined by scientists as the temperature rise that would result from a doubling of CO2levels in the atmosphere. Again, Hansen’s team have used a different method to most scientists and come up with a higher estimate.The IPCC, a collaboration of the world’s climate scientists, found that the computer models that best reproduce past temperatures have a climate sensitivity of 2.5C to 4C.Hansen’s team took a simpler approach, calculating the potential range in temperature rises for a doubling of CO2and then using data on how much heat the Earth has trapped to estimate the most likely climate sensitivity. Their estimate is 4.5C.Cloud formation, which is affected by global heating and aerosol pollution, is a key source of the uncertainties.Anomalouslyhigh temperatures have continued in January 2025, which set a new record for the month and confounded expectations that temperatures would drop with the current La Niña, the cooler part of the El Niño cycle. “This unexpected record may presage higher temperatures this year than many of us thought,” said Hausfather.Hansen’s group also argues that the accelerated global heating they predict will increase ice melting in the Arctic.“As a result, shutdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc) is likely within the next 20-30 years, unless actions are taken to reduce global warming – in contradiction to conclusions of IPCC.“If Amoc is allowed to shut down, it will lock in major problems including sea level rise of several metres – thus, we describe Amoc shutdown as the ‘point of no return’.”The central estimate of another recent study on thetiming of an Amoc collapsewas 2050.However, Hansen said the point of no return could be avoided, based on the growing conviction of young people that they should follow the science. He called for a carbon fee and dividend policy, where all fossil fuels are taxed and the revenue returned to the public.“The basic problem is that the waste products of fossil fuels are still dumped in the air free of charge,” he said. He also backed the rapid development of nuclear power.Hansen also supported research on cooling the Earth using controversial geoengineering techniques to block sunlight, which he prefers to call “purposeful global cooling”.He said: “We do not recommend implementing climate interventions, but we suggest that young people not be prohibited from having knowledge of the potential and limitations of purposeful global cooling in their toolbox.”Political change is needed to achieve all these measures, Hansen said: “Special interests have assumed far too much power in our political systems. In democratic countries the power should be with the voter, not with the people who have the money. That requires fixing some of our democracies, including the US.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisJames HansenGreenhouse gas emissionsClimate scienceFossil fuelsShipping emissionsnewsShareReuse this content"

Climate scientists said they were braced “for the worst”.A major climateportalon the Department of Defense’s website has been scrapped, as has the mainclimate change sectionon the site of the Department of State. A climate changepageon the White House’s website no longer exists, nor does climate contentprovided by the US agriculture department, including information that provides vulnerability assessments for wildfires.An entiresectionon “climate and sustainability” hosted by the Department of Transportation has now vanished, with the department’s new leadership alsoorderingthe elimination of any policy positions, directives or funding “which reference or relate in any way to climate change, ‘greenhouse gas’ [sic] emissions, racial equity, gender identity, ‘diversity, equity and inclusion’ goals, environmental justice or the Justice40 initiative”.Sean Duffy, the US transportation secretary, said the administration is focused on “eliminating excessive regulations that have hindered economic growth, increased costs for American families, and prioritized far-left agendas over practical solutions”.US state departmentTwo before and after screengrabs from a government website, annotated in redSome researchershave foundthat their own studies, from ocean carbon cycles to the connectivity of cleaner electrical grids, have now vanished from federal government websites. Critics say the actions will stifle the public’s understanding of the climate crisis amidrecord-breaking temperaturesand a wave ofstormsandwildfiresthat are being worsened by the burning of fossil fuels.“We should plan for the worst,” said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. “The keys to the car have been given to the polluters and fossil fuel plutocrats and they intend to drive it off the climate cliff.”Environmental Protection AgencyTwo before and after screengrabs from a government website, annotated in redMann said the Trump administration may be following in the footsteps of Florida, which last yearpassed a lawbanning any reference to climate change from state laws.“Nothing would surprise me at this point, including efforts by the administration and the polluters who are running it to ban all references to climate change by administration agencies,” Mann said. “[Florida governor Ron] DeSantis andFloridawere indeed the test bed.”Some climate content remains, for now, on US government websites, although climate change sections on theEnvironmental Protection Agency’sand theDepartment of Energy’swebsites appear to have been made less visible from their homepages.Nasa’skey climate change website, which helps chart and explain the increase in the global temperature and planet-heating emissions, remains active but with a note that it is “going to look a little different in the coming months”.

But its wild salmon population has fallen from more than a million in theearly 1980s to about 500,000 today.While the decimation of the wild population is in large part due to the climate crisis, the country’s salmon industry, which has had escapes of farmed fish and asignificant rise in sea liceparasites, has helped reduce numbers to a historic low, resulting in theclosure of 33 rivers to salmon fishing last summer.Andreas Bjelland Eriksen, the climate and environment minister, said his job was “not to stop or close down human activity itself” but rather to incentivise industrial production while reducing pollution to an “acceptable level”.“This is basically an existential threat against the wild Atlantic salmon and if we overlook that I don’t think we will be able to do the measures that we need to do,” he told a meeting on Norwegian salmon rivers at the Missing Salmon Alliance conference in London last week.Eriksen said: “If you look at wild salmon, 2024 was an exceptionally bad year but it did not stand alone because the two other worst years that we had were in 2023 and 2021.“So it’s really part of a trend and it symbolises something. To me, what it symbolises is that the impact from everything that we do is becoming more than nature, our stocks, can actually handle” he added.But despite this acknowledgment, the minister told the Guardian later that he would not be seeking to stop open-net sea farming.“If you look at the aquaculture industry, they produce food, that is really important to people all over the world, and the goal is to be able to produce that food sustainably in the future,” he said.Thousands of salmon escaped an Icelandic fish farm. The impact could be deadlyRead more“My main issue is therefore not with the production itself, it’s with the pollution and the impact that pollution has on the environment. That is what we need to tackle,” Eriksen said.“And that’s also why we need to work to get a regulatory system that incentivises production but within pollution levels that are not detrimental to wild Atlantic stocks.”The Norwegian Environment Agency has proposed the most restricted salmon fishing season ever this year, with limits suggested on sea salmon fishing in Finnmark as well as on three fjords and 42 rivers.Instead of curtailing open-net sea farming, despite being urged to do so by campaigners, the minister said he planned instead to seek an “acceptable level” of pollution for the wild salmon population.“There are levels of pollution that the environment can tackle and that can be within limits that wild Atlantic salmon stocks can tackle as well. So finding that level is really what we need to go forward. And for some areas that might be zero.”Explore more on these topicsFishSeascape: the state of our oceansNorwayFishingFood (Environment)Endangered speciesMarine lifeWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

So what we’re saying is we need this massive increase in the budget to £2.65bn.”Damaging storms in recent years had also affected the quality of flood defence schemes, the government said, leaving many in need of urgent repair. Others needed an upgrade because they were built when the impact of the climate crisis was not as well known.A total of 31 new projects are being given the green light, while £36m is being spent in 2025 to undertake urgent repairs to defences damaged during extreme flooding events.Announcing the new funding, the government stated: “As well as protecting families from the devastation of flooding, the investment supports economic growth by protecting businesses, supporting jobs, and supporting a stable economy in the face of the increasing risk of flooding as a result of climate change.“It will also protect farmland which has been badly hit by recent storms, in turn helping to safeguard farm businesses and farmers’ profits.”Farmers affected by severe weather between October 2023 and March 2024 have been compensated to the tune of more than £57m, Defra has reported. The farming recovery fund has supported 12,700 businesses to cover the cost of restoring their farmland.With climate breakdown contributing to more extremes in weather and more frequent flooding, more homes and businesses are expected to be flooded in the coming years.View image in fullscreenEmma Hardy at Castlehill Aquagreen in Bransholme, Hull, which is designed to store excess water during a flood.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianWhen asked about whether it was possible to simply not build homes in areas at risk of flooding, Hardy, who previously worked in a school that was badly flooded, said that would mean cities such as Hull would not be able to build anything at all.She suggested: “If we can not build on a flood plain then obviously that’s best. But there are ways of building that mean homes are not at risk of increased flooding and, more importantly, don’t increase the risk of flooding elsewhere.”While the money was largely not earmarked for flood prevention schemes at the source, such as upland restoration, Hardy said the government was also looking at reviewing how the “flood formula” was calculated, which is used to allocate money based on the number of properties that would be protected.This would mean schemes that have a wider good, such as natural flood management, would be more readily funded.“It’s quite difficult with natural flood management to come up with a hard-edged calculation on how many properties are protected,” she said.The shadow environment secretary, Victoria Atkins, said: “In government, the Conservatives invested record amounts of money in flood defences and coastal erosion. To say otherwise is wholly untrue.“Steve Reed has not told us where this latest money has come from, whether it is in fact a repackaging of money invested by a Conservative government, or how he intends to offer tailored support to frequently flooded communities.”Explore more on these topicsFloodingLabourClimate crisisHullnewsShareReuse this content"

Beijing responded with its own tariffs on American fossil fuels and agricultural machinery, but British officials have not confirmed whether they would respond in a similar way if Trump turns his attention to imports from the UK.Australian officials left scrambling over Trump’s ‘unclear’ tariff proposals following election, documents revealRead moreSpeaking tothe Guardian’s Politics Weekly podcast, Hunt said: “The reason that you generally hit back with retaliatory tariffs – which is what China, America, Canada and Mexico are all in the process of doing, or threatening to do – is to give you leverage so that the other side then wants to remove the tariffs that they’ve introduced.“But our … goods exports to the United States account for less than 0.5% of US GDP. So we should be very realistic, we don’t have any leverage when it comes to that.”He added: “We are a country that has always flourished on the back of free trade. [We were the] first country in the world to unilaterally remove our [trade] borders back in 1846. [A trade war] is bad for British manufacturers who use a lot of imported materials and it’s bad for inflation.

Hesaid this weekthat Britain was “out of line” with its trade policies, but added: “I’m sure that one, I think that one, can be worked out.”Trump also spoke warmly about his relationship with the prime minister, sparking hope in Whitehall that the UK could avoid the tariffs being imposed on China and threatened against Canada and Mexico. Starmer is hoping to persuade Trump not to impose tariffs on Britain byusing US trade datawhich shows the US ran a trade surplus with the UK in 2023, rather than British figures that show the reverse.But ministers are aware the president could include the UK in the trade war at any moment, and have been meeting for weeks to discuss their response should this happen. During Trump’s first term, the UK was hit by US tariffs on the EU as a whole, and responded by imposing its own on American exports of whiskey, blue jeans and motorbikes.This time, however, Brexit has given Britain the chance to avoid being caught up in a US-European trade war, and to set its own tariff policy outside the European customs union.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity.Among the allegations are that he seriously sexually assaulted and harassed several women in the mid and late 1990s when they worked for NM Rothschild.De Rothschild had a reputation for being autocratic and feared, with one source describing him as “totalitarian”. He was a financial adviser to the late Queen Elizabeth, whom he accompanied to Royal Ascot races, and was knighted in 1989.Although historical, their claims are likely to raise questions about the working culture experiencedby women within the Rothschild banking empire, which comprises a complex range of wealth advisory and investment banking services.De Rothschild, who died aged 91, was chair of NM Rothschild for more than 20 years and also served on the boards of the Economist and the parent company of the Daily Telegraph. A scion of one of the most famous dynasties in global banking, he spent 44 years working within Rothschild family businesses.According to sources who spoke to the Guardian, he used his office within NM Rothschild, a stone’s throw from the Bank of England in the City of London,to force himself upon women over several years.More than eight sources, some with direct experience of events, described incidents dating from the mid and late 1990s. However, multiple sources claimed that this kind of misconduct by De Rothschild went unchecked for decades.Do you have information about this story?

Their accounts described incidents in the financial group’s old London offices, partly now demolished and rebuilt on St Swithin’s Lane, the site first occupied by the bank in 1809.The claims include serious sexual assaults. One included a violent assault of a member of staff when she was a young woman working for him. Another allegation is that he put his hands down a different woman’s top and under her underwear to grope her. And a third woman claimed she was forced to perform a sex act on him while he sat on his desk.These allegations, dating to the mid and late 1990s, were put to lawyers acting for Rothschild & Co, the group that succeeded NM Rothschild. The allegations were also put to the Rothschild family via the same lawyers. The Guardian also asked whether anyone at the bank or the Rothschild family was aware of the allegations, and if so, whether they tried to tackle the issues.Lawyers acting for Rothschild & Co refused to answer whether there was any information related to misconduct by De Rothschild, stating only that an “initial review of their records” yielded “nothing”, but also saying they did not have enough information to investigate further. No response was received on behalf of the family.The Guardian also asked about the bank’s current and historical approach to complaints about sexual and other non-financial misconduct.View image in fullscreenThe claims against Evelyn de Rothschild are likely to raise questions about the working culture experiencedby women within the Rothschild banking empire.Photograph: Bloomberg/GettyVia lawyers, the banking group said: “We deal with any complaint quickly and decisively. We prize the culture we have developed over the years and there is no place for such behaviour in our culture.”They added: “If any inappropriate behaviour is alleged, including sexual misconduct, we seek to establish exactly what has happened. Whilst a formal complaint may not always be made, we investigate allegations of behaviour that falls below our standards.”Sources claimed De Rothschild would encourage women to think he could help with their careers, presenting himself as a potential sponsor or advocate in financial services. He would then request that they attend in his office on the pretence of a task or work-related conversation before harassing or assaulting them, it is alleged.If they expressed concerns about his actions to other members of staff, they would have their employment terminated, often with payouts, if they agreed to keep his activities confidential, it is alleged.“He would ask questions aimed at finding out if you were well connected. If you weren’t, then I think you were more likely to be regarded as fair game,”one woman claimed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As well as serving on the boards of the Telegraph Media Group and the Economist, he was also a director of the trust that owns the Globe theatre.Rothschild is one of the City of London’s most renowned institutions, and is among the most storied European banking institutions, with origins tracing back to 15th-century Frankfurt, Germany.The Rothschild family remains entwined with the institution, as a significant shareholder. As well as being a financial adviser to Queen Elizabeth II, De Rothschild also founded a charity with Mark Shand, the late brother of the current queen and was frequently pictured in conversation with King Charles when he was the Prince of Wales.He shared a passion for horse racing with the royal family and was chair of United Racehorses, which owned race courses at Sandown and Epsom. He was married three times.A range of high-profile figures attended his funeral, and his eulogy was delivered by Bill Clinton.The Rothschild group, which combines an array of financial services including investment banking and wealth management, was at the heart of the UK’s privatisation wave in the 1980s.Its London arm, NM Rothschild & Sons, was founded in 1809 by Nathan Mayer Rothschild, close to the Bank of England. Such was the sharp rise of its merchant banking activities that by 1826 it effectively saved the UK’s central bank with a loan of gold.NM Rothschild & Sons later merged with another arm of thefamily’s European banking empire, Paris Orléans SA, and in 2011, the company rebranded from NM Rothschild & Sons to Rothschild & Co. In 2015, the parent company of the Rothschild Group, which was previously called Paris Orléans, also changed its name to Rothschild & Co, according to the Rothschild Archive.The claims against De Rothschild come against a backdrop of historical complaints against men who held positions of power, notably the former Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed.Since his death two years ago, a number of women have come forward to make allegations against Fayed, with incidents dating back to the mid-1970s.Explore more on these topicsBankingFinancial sectorRothschild & ConewsShareReuse this content"

They include many cases of ovarian cancer and smaller numbers who have contracted mesothelioma and peritoneal cancer.J&J has been the subject of long-running lawsuits in the US over similar allegations of cancer links to talc, which it disputes. The firmhas proposedpaying billions of dollars tosettle almost 60,000 US claims, while continuing to deny that its products have caused cancer.This will be the first time the company has faced a legal challenge on the issue in a British court.Tom Longstaff, a partner at KP Law who is leading the UK case, said: “All the claimants who have sustained cancer after using J&J’s talcum powder products have experienced a life-changing illness. In some cases they have died from their cancer, leaving their families devastated. All of these innocent individuals deserve justice.”A spokesperson for Kenvue, formerly part of J&J which now has responsibility for talc-related claims outside the US and Canada,said: “We sympathise deeply with people who suffer from cancer and understand that they and their families want answers, but the robust science shows that use of our talc-based powder does not cause cancer.“For over a decade, lawyers in the United States have created unfounded confusion and unnecessary fear about talc, an ingredient that has been used safely in foods, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and consumer products for decades. It is clear that lawyers are now seeking to exploit cancer patients and their families in the United Kingdom by spreading this same fear.“We stand behind the safety of talc-based Johnson’s baby powder. Decades of testing by medical experts at leading institutions in the UK and around the world using the most state-of-the-art testing protocols demonstrates that the product is safe, does not contain asbestos and does not cause cancer.”Explore more on these topicsJohnson & JohnsonPharmaceuticals industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Various groups have been set up and we have been talking to Downing Street about what works. One of our main messages to the leadership is we need to do more on illegal migration especially.”Another said the group wanted ministers to “shout louder” about what they were doing to tackle legal and illegal migration, including deporting tens of thousands of people back to their home countries.A Labour party source said: “Groups of MPs meet all the time about lots of different issues. Labour MPs are rightly concerned about Nigel Farage’s plans to make people pay to access NHS services and will carry on taking the fight to them and other opposition parties in parliament and at the ballot box.”Downing Street has been worried for months about the rise of Reform, but those concerns deepened this week after YouGov became the first major pollster to show the party ahead of Labour and the Conservatives. The poll on Monday showed Reform on 25%, with Labour on 24% and the Tories on 21%.Morgan McSweeney,the prime minister’s chief of staff, has made it one of his top priorities to combat Reform’s appeal, telling MPs that Labour will be able to do so by showing tangible improvements to local public services.Downing Street has in recent weeks sent campaign strategists and polling experts to brief MPs on where and how the party has been able to outperform its national poll rating in recent council byelections.One MP said one of the main pieces of advice had been to identify projects local voters have long been asking for and to make sure they are delivered. McSweeney has told allies he helped defeat the British National party in east London 15 years ago in part by focusing on areas where previous local and national governments had promised infrastructure projects but failed to build them.Matthew Faulding, the secretary of the parliamentary Labour party and a close ally of McSweeney, helped organise the briefings, according to those who attended. Some MPs, however, still want the party leadership to go further, especially when it comes to immigration.One MP said they had been unimpressed recently by the response of ministers at recent briefings when asked about the possibility of processing asylum seeker claims offshore – somethingStarmer has saidhe is open to. “Even though the party policy is that we might do this, ministers have mainly been stressing how expensive it would be,” the person said.Another said they had urged ministers to be more vocal about deportation flights.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The statistics have caused alarm among human rights campaigners, but some MPs believe the party needs to be more vocal in publicising them.One said: “We need to take tougher action on immigration, but we also need to shout louder about what we are doing.”While Labour MPs discuss tactics to counter the threat of Reform, some are seeking lessons on combatting rightwing populists from outside the UK.A small group is planning a trip to Germany in the coming weeks to find out what they can learn from the rise of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), which is expected to perform well in the country’s election later this month.Reform is hoping to pick up seats at this year’s local elections, but is hoping for an even bigger result next year at the next set of local elections, and in the vote for the Welsh parliament. Some in Labour believe, however, that Reform’s poll rating will begin to fade ahead of national elections as scrutiny increases on their policy platform and the views of their candidates.One minister said: “Reform are doing well, but then Ukip also did well in between national elections.

Let’s see what happens and what to learn from it,” he said. “If it is possible to make very big savings whilst delivering the government’s priorities, then of course we should be interested in how that’s being done.”Musk suggested at a Trump rally in New York last month that it would be possible to cut “at least $2tn” from US government spending by eradicating waste.The NAO does not have such an executive role but it scrutinises government spending and highlights areas of waste, with Davies highlighting the £3bn of annual savings that had come from the watchdog’s recommendations.Giving his annual speech in parliament, Davies, who is the comptroller and auditor general, said the public sector as a whole was suffering from poor productivity, and he highlighted the need for fundamental reform in the face of rising demand and costs alongside unsatisfactory outcomes.He made the case that artificial intelligence should be “rightly at the top of the agenda” when it comes to improving productivity, with “clear potential for reducing the time taken for routine tasks”.Davies also said the “situation is urgent” when it came to looking at areas of spending that had grown hugely in recent years.“A succession of NAO reports have concluded that systems have become unsustainable. I think NHS demand is outstripping the capacity of the country to fund it in the current way, the special education needs budget has now been doubled, without a doubling of anything like the quality of outcomes. So, just if you start stacking up those patently unsustainable financial frameworks, then clearly we have to do something,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

NHS, tough times, I’m going to scrap all of those equality, diversity and inclusion people. We’ll save loads of money doing that, and we’ll divert the money into actual patient care’.”He added: “Except, ask black nurses about their experiences of being bullied in the workplace in an organisation that has had black people in it since it was founded pretty much … Empire Windrush, NHS foundation, same year – that generation built the NHS.“You look at outcomes: prostate cancer, black men twice as likely to die of prostate cancer than white men, black women three times more likely to die in childbirth than white women. We’ve got some real racial inequalities here.”Streeting went on to say he believed addressing those challenges was a political fight he was willing to take on, but added that he would “also need the profession to help”.But he added: “Sometimes there are some really daft things being done in the name of equality, diversity and inclusion, which [have] undermined the cause. For example, there was one member of NHS staff who was merrily tweeting a job ad online and saying part of her practice was anti-whiteness.”Streeting added: “I just thought: what the hell does that say to the bloke up in Wigan who’s more likely to die earlier than his more affluent white counterparts down in London? We’ve got real issues of inequality that affect white working-class people.”His comments come after it was announced that NHS England had scrapped a number of pledges, including plans toexpand maternal mental health support to at least 66,000 women.Streeting said there had been some well-meaning but misguided approaches to equality within the NHS. “Where we see health inequalities, whether they affect men and women, black people, white people, rich and poor, we’ve got to take a much more evidence-based approach to those inequalities, and say if you’re on the wrong end of the stats, we want to deal with that to make sure we get equality of outcome.“And I was really frustrated just last week to see the government’s commitment to have a men’s health strategy juxtaposed against women’s health, as if by focusing on the inequalities that affect men or the issues that affect men, that somehow we’d be deprioritising women.”He added: “I don’t think that’s how my sister would feel about my health, and it’s certainly not how I’d feel about her health. So I think we’ve got to take a much better approach to this issue.”Examples of racism and inequalities faced by NHS staff have been highlighted in recent years. A report by the General Medical Council (GMC) found that British doctors of black, Asian and minority ethnic origin and overseas-trained medics working in the UKexperienced “persistent and pernicious” inequality throughout their careers. A previous study by the Royal College of Nursing found that white nurses were twice as likely as black and Asian colleagues to be promoted in the NHS, withminority ethnic staff overlooked due to structural racism.Wes Streeting in conversation with Pippa CrerarJoin Wes Streeting in conversation with Pippa Crerar discussing England’s health and social care system and how Labour plans to turn it around.

A Liberal Democrat source said the party was likely to support the amendment.Government figures conceded that, as things stand, the amendment is likely to pass when Alton pushes it to a vote next week. “If the Tories pull the stops out to get a decent number of peers out and Lib Dems get theirs together, they can muster quite a big number,” a Labour source said.This would trigger a process known as parliamentary ping-pong, with the bill sent back to the Commons to consider the Lords’ changes. It could put Labour MPs in the uncomfortable position where they are whipped to strip out an amendment intended to combat modern slavery.Alton said his amendment was designed “to ensure that our race to net zero doesn’t leave our modern slavery commitments in tatters”.“We cannot have a situation where one department is required to eradicate slavery from supply chains while another depends upon it entirely. This amendment will ensure that no public money can be used to prop up the Chinese Communist party’s industry of slavery, and that our green transition is one that has due respect for human rights.”Labour took a robust stance on this issue in opposition. It backed moves to declare China’s actions in Xinjiang genocide and to block trade deals with countries found by UK courts to have committed genocide. The party hassoftened its positionsince entering government and has sought to build closer economic ties with Beijing.Some Labour backbenchers, however, could rebel if Alton’s amendment is voted on in the Commons.Sarah Champion, the Labour MP and chair of the international development committee, proposed an amendment in the Commons in October to make respect for human rights one of the core objects of GBEnergy.“I’m gravely concerned that without sufficient safeguards in place, we will run the risk of transitioning to net zero on the backs of those in slavery,” Champion said. “We need to see clear intent that modern slavery cannot make up any part of GB Energy supply chains.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I know there is significant cross-party support for this.”Alton, Kennedy and Champion are all members of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance onChina(IPAC), which campaigns for a tougher stance towards Beijing.Luke de Pulford, the executive director of IPAC, said: “No MP wants to have to explain to their constituents why they voted in favour of funding slave-made renewables. Given the very strong stand taken by Labour in opposition regarding Uyghurs, many will be profoundly dismayed at being asked to vote down this reasonable amendment. We can expect to see plenty of rebels.”Meanwhile UK regulators are considering a mooted stock market listing by Shein, the Chinese fast-fashion company, amidconcerns about forced labour in its supply chains. Stop Uyghur Genocide, a campaign group, has launched a judicial process to block any initial public offering (IPO) by Shein. The company has said it strictly prohibits forced labour.Liam Byrne, the Labour chair of the business select committee, has been corresponding with regulators about the safeguards and legal checks for companies hoping to list on the London Stock Exchange. He said the UK needed to strengthen its laws to combat modern slavery.“We must now upgrade our Modern Slavery Act to impose a tougher requirement on major firms to assure us there they’re taking a zero tolerance approach to forced labour. Both the US and the EU are taking these steps,” Byrne said. “So there’s now a real risk that the country that led the abolition of slavery has second-class protection against this appalling abuse.”Explore more on these topicsForced labourXinjiangChinaSolar powerGreen economyGreen politicsModern slaverynewsShareReuse this content"

The dispute comes with the foreign secretary, David Lammy, leading attempts toshed the UK’s reputation as a hub for “dirty money”.The BVI do not currently publish details of who owns companies incorporated there, a practice that campaigners say makes the British overseas territory a magnet for financial crime, including money laundering and tax evasion.Companies based on the islands have appeared in multiple international investigations into alleged wrongdoing, including last month’srevelations by the Guardian and media partners about alleged tax evasionby the Russian oligarch and former Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich.Overseas territories have pledged to introduce publicly accessible registers of beneficial ownership (PARBOs), as have crown dependencies such as Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.However, last month, amid concern about delays and resistance, the BVI published proposals that have met with fury from MPs and civil society groups, who say the system would make it virtually impossible to find out who owns their companies.The row threatens to put the UK and the BVI on a constitutional collision course, amid calls for the government to issue a rarely used “order in council” to force the BVI to comply.The BVI proposals are part of a consultation process about granting access to corporate ownership data to people deemed to have a “legitimate interest” in the information, such as law enforcement agencies, businesses, journalists and civil society groups.However, under the draft policy, applicants could only get hold of company ownership information if they are involved in regulatory or legal proceedings about financial crime, or a criminal case where a court determines the data could help solve the investigation.The owner of the company would be tipped off about any such request and would have five days to object to the information being shared.In a letter to the premier of the BVI, Natalio Wheatley, MPs said this could “expose journalists to legal or physical intimidation when investigating high-risk stories on drug cartels, kleptocrats, or human traffickers”.It would also serve as an early warning system for “bad actors”, allowing them to liquidate assets before an investigation, wrote Joe Powell MP and Mitchell, who jointly chair the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on anti-corruption and responsible tax.They also criticised the “logical impossibility” of a proposal under which applicants would have to know the identity of a company’s owner in order to request information about who owns it.The BVI plans also include a narrow definition of what constitutes ownership, while access to the information would come with restrictions on how it could be used, including potential financial penalties and legal action for publishing it.Mitchell and Powell urged the BVI to reconsider their approach.Mitchell, a former development minister and deputy foreign secretary, said the BVI proposals showed “total contempt for the British parliament’s declared insistence that open registers of beneficial ownership be implemented throughout our overseas territories.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Officials made the UK’s position clear during a summit with the overseas territories in November last year.Mitchell echoedcalls previously issued by the government’s anti-corruption champion, Dame Margaret Hodge, for ministers to issue an “order in council” forcing the BVI to comply.The tool is used very rarely, in order to respect the self-governance of the overseas territories. It has previously been used to abolish the death penalty and decriminalise homosexuality in overseas territories.A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “This government has made tackling illicit finance in the UK, as well as in our overseas territories and crown dependencies a priority since day one. As the foreign secretary has said, he is taking up the issue of public registers of beneficial ownership with full vigour.”The campaign group Transparency International has also expressed grave concerns.MPs are due to discuss the progress of PARBOs during a Westminster Hall debate on Wednesday, amid growing concern about proposals by the BVIs and other overseas territories.The government of the BVI declined to comment. In a previous press release, it expressed a commitment to transparency and tackling financial crime. It added that the formulation of open registers required a “tailored approach” depending on the jurisdiction.Explore more on these topicsBritish Virgin IslandsTax havensAndrew MitchellCorporate governancenewsShareReuse this content"

There wouldn’t be any attacks on civilian infrastructure, civilians, rapes.”Setting up a tribunal, she said, was also about “putting pressure” on Putin and the regime “to really stop this war, and also to give a clear signal to other aggressors or would-be aggressors who are or may be contemplating attacking neighbouring countries”.Talks, which began last June between the EU,Ukraine, pan-European human rights body the Council of Europe (CoE) and 37 other countries, had been held up over whether Putin and other Russian leaders should be granted immunity. As a compromise, it is understood that Putin and senior figures would not be prosecuted while in office.In a separate development, Ukraine’s presidentVolodymyr Zelenskyysaid he would agree to direct talks with Putin to end the war that will reach a grim three-year milestone later this month.British journalist Piers Morgan asked Zelenskyy how he would feel if he sat opposite Putin at a negotiating table.View image in fullscreenEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told reporters: ‘There is no doubt that Putin has committed the crime of aggression, which is deciding to attack another country.’Photograph: Olivier Matthys/EPA“If that is the only setup in which we can bring peace to the citizens of Ukraine and not lose people, definitely we will go for this setup,” Zelenskyy said, adding that he would also require other “participants” to be present.In the interview with Morgan, Zelenskyy put the Ukrainian death toll at 45,100, with 390,000 injured since the full-scale invasion in February 2022. He estimated the Russian dead to be 350,000, with between 600,000 and 700,000 injured, and said Russian forces had “many” missing in action.The international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague has issued an arrest warrant for Putin and other senior Russian officials over the abduction of Ukrainian children. But it does not have the power to try crimes of aggression, as Russia has not ratified the ICC treaty.Another mooted option is the amendment of the ICC Rome Statute in the UN general assembly, but many experts argue that would be unworkable, as many members of the court have not submitted to its jurisdiction over the crime of aggression.To break the logjam, the CoE, which has 46 member states and expelled Russia after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has offered to host the tribunal.The talks sped up as Donald Trump prepared to return to the White House, throwing uncertainty over US support for Ukraine. Nearly 40 countries have been involved in the talks, aftera plea for justice from Zelenskyy,who has cited “burned cities and tortured people” during the atrocities of Bucha and Mariupol, and missile strikes against ordinary civilians.Iryna Mudra, the deputy head of the office of president Zelenskyy, said Ukraine’s people wanted to hold the invaders accountable “and to show the world that such horrible war crimes will have serious consequences. [Zelenskyy’s] message is clear,” she went on. “Evil must not remain unpunished. Peace must be just. Ukraine cannot and will not compromise on justice.”A Ukrainian Nobel peace laureate, Oleksandra Matviichuk, has alsocalled for the swift creation of a tribunal to try Putin, arguing that it could deter Russian forces from inflicting atrocities on Ukraine.The CoE’s secretary general, Alain Berset, said he hoped work on a text to create the tribunal would be finished this year.Berset, who met Trump in Paris for thereopening of Notre Dame in December, said it was “not so clear” how the tribunal would be affected by any peace talks launched by the US administration: “We try to go as fast as possible in a highly uncertain context.”Berset, a former president of Switzerland, signalled that US support was needed if the tribunal was to work. “I think it’s also clear for everybody that without the G7 [the tribunal] will never fly.”In a related effort to make Russia pay for the damage it has inflicted on Ukraine, the CoE also proposed joining possible talks on an “international claims commission” for Ukraine.Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineEuropeVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

After all, the last rites of the 70-year-old liberal world order were also read when Trump came to power in 2017, before that order was briefly disinterred under Joe Biden. The diplomatic pearls were collectively clutched when Trump 1.0 threatened to pull out of Nato, launched a trade war with China, introduced a travel ban on mainly Muslim countries, and withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation trade agreement championed by Barack Obama. In 2019, Trump dropped the threat of a 5% tariff in return forMexicosending 6,000 militarised police to the southern border. Grievances, and bargains, have always animated Trump’s thinking.But Trump 2.0 has new elements. Last time, he used the threat and imposition of tariffs to extract trade concessions from bothChinaand the European Union, but not as a first and ubiquitous weapon of choice to bolster all his diplomatic dealings.So far,Canada, Mexico, Colombia, China and possibly the EU and Denmark, have faced the threat – or reality – of tariffs. Panama has been warned of a US invasion and Canada of annexation. The UK stands nervously mute in the shadows, hoping not to catch the president’s attention.Trump’s friends will claim that last week’s tariff threats delivered quick wins. Colombia caved on migrants. Panama has agreed not to renew its involvement in the Belt and Road pact with China. Both Canada and Mexico made concessions to secure a delay to 25% tariffs until further talks, due to be completed by 4 March. In the meantime, Mexico will reinforce the border with 10,000 extra troops. Two working parties will be set up into drugs and into the border. Canada will appoint a “fentanyl tsar”, and commit C$200m to fresh intelligence gathering on cartels.Meanwhile, Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, is thanking Trump for raising the importance of Greenland’s security, and the threat posed by Russia in the Arctic. China may be in talks before Monday that could cede control of TikTok, its social network that is popular in the US and elsewhere in the west. Ukraine has offered the US rare minerals if the US will continue its aid. Everything in diplomacy, it seems, has a price.But is shakedown diplomacy the optimal way for the US to secure its national interest, or could he achieve his goals by not forcing the world permanently to live at one minute to midnight? The Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, had already adopted a tougher policy against the drug cartels. By Trump claiming she is in a conspiracy with the drug lords, the objective of cooperation between the two countries becomes harder.Trump has also hardly won new friends in Canada. Doug Ford, the centre-right Ontario premier, wasfilmedsaying on Monday: “Election day, was I happy this guy won? One hundred per cent I was. But then the guy pulled out the knife and fucking yanked it into us. We’re supposed to be his closest allies, his closest friend. It’s terrible.”US presidents have of course crudely threatened other powers in the past, using economic leverage to do so. The whole modern-day architecture of sanctions and the deployment of the dollar has become an institutionalised means of applying long-term economic leverage to change the behaviour of others. The first shock and awe sanctions against Russia after the invasion of Crimea in 2013 were intended by the White House to make the rouble reel, and in the end they failed.But sanctions are a war of attrition. Trump’s shakedown diplomacy glories in high-profile, winner-take-all confrontations.Implicit in the Trump approach is of course a rejection of the whole notion of alliances, or that the US has ideological goals that it shares with other nations. American presidents since the founding fathers, Henry Kissinger wrote a decade ago, “have always implied whilst other nations had selfish interests, America had principles and destiny”. From Roosevelt to Wilson to Kennedy, the US adopted the role as conscience to the world, and then its policeman.In Trump’s rhetoric, by contrast, there is no pretence the US is acting for the greater good of the world – in wielding the threat of tariffs there is no defence even of the world trade order, or of free markets. All that ideological superstructure is stripped out. This is purely about leveraging economic strength to secure American interests – whether it be to cut migration, the flow of drugs or boosting American jobs and factories. A few buttressing arguments are made such as the unfairness of Chinese trade practices, or stolen US patents, but these issues are for the US to unilaterally to declare and act upon, not any independent arbitral body.The danger for Trump is threefold. Beating up the smaller guy in the room like Mexico does not impress. Taking on China or the EU is different. As the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has said: “If our commercial interests are attacked, Europe, as a true power, will have to make itself respected and therefore react.” Few economists see winners in trade wars between superpowers.Secondly, as other middle income nations grow in economic strength, they may veer towards the Chinese camp as the safest, most stable course. The more the US cuts its soft power assets such as USAid the more likely alienation is.Thirdly, the madman theory as a means of keeping an adversary guessing has limits, as Roseanne McManusrecently pointed out in Foreign Affairs.In 1968, Richard Nixon told his chief of staff, HR Haldeman, “I want the North Vietnamese to believe that I’ve reached the point that I might do anything to stop the war.” Nixon suggested that his advisers could “slip the word” to the North Vietnamese that “we can’t restrain him when he’s angry – and he has his hand on the nuclear button”. Shortly after entering office, Nixon and Kissinger, his national security adviser, attempted to do just that. Following Kissinger’s instructions while visiting Moscow, the White House adviser Leonard Garment told Soviet officials that Nixon was “a dramatically disjointed personality” who was “capable of barbaric cruelty”, “more than a little paranoid”, and “predictably unpredictable”.In the end Kissinger had to admit that the gambit failed. Vietnam would not surrender, at any price.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpEconomic policyMexicoCanadaChinanewsShareReuse this content"

On current progress in AI, he said: “We’re not talking about matching the level of humans yet. If we get a system that is as smart as a cat or a rat, that would be a victory.”However, LeCun’s fellow QEPrize winner and AI “godfather”, Yoshua Bengio, warned more progress wasneeded on the technology’s safetyand called on next week’s global AI summit in Paris to grasp the issue.“I’d like to see the leaders of this world to better understand the magnitude of what we are doing, both in terms of the power we’re creating, which could be for good or be dangerous, and the risks that come with that power,” he said.In 2018, Bengio and LeCun shared the Turing award – seen as the equivalent of a Nobel prize for computing – with Geoffrey Hinton, who was also announced as a QEPrize winner on Tuesday. The award comes after AI pioneers won two Nobel prizes last year. They included Hinton – whoshared the Nobel for physicswith another recipient of this year’s QEPrize, the US physicist John Hopfield – and the Google DeepMind scientists among thewinners of the chemistry prize.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were tagged negative if they reported a decrease, weakening or worsening of the assessed outcome.Most papers in the review reported a positive impact of female leadership: 119 (87%) were positive and statistically significant.The review identified female leaders’ positive influence on six areas of impact: financial performance, risk and stability; innovation; engagement with ethical and sustainability initiatives; health outcomes; organisational culture and climate, including reputation, employee retention and team cohesion and communication; and influence on other women’s careers and aspirations.UK chief auditor ‘open to learning’ from Musk amid NHS funding concernsRead moreEven the studies reporting mixed findings still largely pointed to positive results, particularly when modified by other factors.“What is less clear is why women leaders have this impact, particularly in the face of overt and covert biases, discrimination, harassment, patriarchal norms, etc,”the researchers wrote.The answer, they suggested, may lie in women’s more effective transformational leadership behaviours and their tendency to use more democratic and participative styles.“In all sectors, across leadership roles and across geographies, women’s leadership can produce positive results,” the researchers wrote.“Women leaders’ success, however, cannot be separated from the contexts in which they work and unsupportive environments can affect the extent to which women leaders can have an impact.”They concluded: “Increased and sustained investment in women’s leadership within the health sector can lead to improved outcomes for organisations and their clients.“Such investments must not only target individual women, but also seek to foster organisational cultures that promote and retain women leaders and support their independent decision making.”In a linked editorial, the BMJ’s international editor, Dr Jocalyn Clark, argued that men’s monopoly on global health leadership was at odds with the scientific evidence.And in the current context of the backlash against rights and diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, it was even more important to advocate for gender equality, she said.“Change is the responsibility of everyone – not just women,” she wrote. “But clearly, more women appointed to leadership positions could drive transformative change in these biased systems.”Explore more on these topicsHealthInequalityGendernewsShareReuse this content"

Officials said their work might depend upon the wind and tidal conditions in the river, where the plane and helicopter crashed last Wednesday night after colliding as the plane was about to land at nearby Ronald Reagan National airport, killing everyone onboard both aircraft.‘Stomach-turning’: Democrats condemn Trump’s DEI claims after Washington plane crashRead moreThroughout the day, crews could be seen lifting large pieces of the plane from the river. The National Transportation Safety Board said it did not plan to provide further updates from the scene.Authorities said early on in the effort that they had expected to recover the remains of everyone who died. They are focusing first on the jet and hope to recover the Black Hawk helicopter later this week.Col Francis B Pera of the army corps of engineers said salvage crews on Monday were able to pull one of the two jet engines from the river, along with large pieces of the plane’s exterior. They were also working to recover a wing of the plane, which had flown out of Wichita, Kansas.Sixty passengers and four crew were on the American Airlines flight, including figure skaters returning from the 2025 US Figure Skating Championships in Wichita.The Black Hawk was on a training mission. Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; Capt Rebecca M Lobach, of Durham, North Carolina, were onboard.Federal investigators are trying to piece together the events that led to the collision. Full investigations typically take a year or more, but investigators hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days.Wednesday’s crash was the deadliest in the US since 12 November 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people onboard and five on the ground.Explore more on these topicsWashington DC plane crashWashington DCPlane crashesnewsShareReuse this content"

The newspaper said an additional flight had departed on Monday.CNN later reported one of the flights had “about nine or 10” people onboard who were detained in the US without valid immigration documents.US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) referred a request for comment from the Guardian to the homeland security department, which did not immediately respond.“President Trump is not messing around, and he’s no longer going to allow America to be a dumping ground for illegal criminals from nations all over this world,” Leavitt told Fox.“Today, the first flights from the United States toGuantánamo Baywith illegal migrants are under way.”Donald Trump last week signed anexecutive orderto prepare a huge detention camp at the navy base at Guantánamo that he said could house up to 30,000 people deported from the US.‘America’s gulag’: Trump’s Guantánamo ploy tars migrants as terroristsRead more“Some of them are so bad, we don’t even trust the countries [of origin] to hold them because we don’t want them coming back,” he said. “So we’re going to send them out to Guantánamo. This will double our capacity immediately.”The news of the first flights, containing deportees of unknown nationality, comes a day after El Salvador offered to acceptundocumented migrantsfrom any country – and even incarcerated US citizens. The announcement by El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, followed a visit by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio.Leavitt told Fox that Trump was determined to complete what he has previously called “thelargest deportation effortin American history”, of 15 million to 20 million people, for which he has said he wouldengage the militaryto help achieve it.“El Salvador has not disagreed to the repatriation of [only] their own citizens but also illegal criminals from other nations who will then be sent to their prisons,” she said.“Venezuela as well has agreed to repatriation flights, and Colombia also agreed to cooperate with the repatriation of illegal Colombian nationals that we have found in the interior of our country.”Rubio praised El Salvador’s willingness to accept deportees. “No country’s ever made an offer of friendship such as this. [It is] the most unprecedented and extraordinary migratory agreement anywhere in the world,” he said.Immigration advocates, meanwhile, have expressed concern over the legality of deporting those in the US illegally to countries they are not from.“Obviously, we’ll have to study it on our end; there are obviously legalities involved. We have a constitution, we have all sorts of things,”Rubio saidon Monday.According to the Wall Street Journal, the US naval base at Guantánamo is equipped to hold about 120 people.Known to critics as“America’s gulag”, the facility has housed several people accused of plotting the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the US, as well as others deemed to be “enemy combatants”. Some have been detained for years without trial.Trump’s plan to use it to detain civilians deported from the US further demonizes immigrants, advocates have said.“This is political theater and part of the Trump administration’s broader effort to paint immigrants as threats in the United States … and fan anti-immigrant sentiment,” Eleanor Acer, senior director for refugee protection at Human Rights First,told the Guardian.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationGuantánamo BayDonald TrumpEl SalvadorCubaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

A time that we have never experienced in our country. This is not the time for internal division,” the prime minister, MúteEgede, said in a social media post that did not mention Trump.Greenland’s parliament later unanimously approved his proposal for the 11 March election.Trump in December renewedhis wish to control the strategically important islandand did not rule out using military or economic power to achieve this.A semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, Greenland has said it is open for business but that it does not wish to be part of the US.It was due to hold parliamentary elections before 6 April.Denmark has ruled the island for centuries. Greenland was a Danish colony until 1953 and has since gained broad autonomy, including the right to declare independence, although Copenhagen remains responsible for Greenland’s security and foreign policy.‘The world order could start to evolve from the Arctic’: Trump, thin ice and the fight for the Northwest PassageRead moreA majority of Greenlanders would vote for independence if such a referendum were held now, a recent survey by pollster Verian, commissioned by the Danish newspaper Berlingske and Greenlandic daily Sermitsiaq, showed.About 28% said they would vote against independence.The island holds vast untapped mineral resources but its economy depends on fishing and annual grants from Denmark.The poll also showed that 45% of people would not want independence if the standard of living was negatively affected, highlighting that the future path towards it remains unclear.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDonald TrumpUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

We have a constitution, we have all sorts of things, but it’s a very generous offer.”On Tuesday afternoon, Trump said he was exploring the legality of sending dangerous US criminals to prisons in other countries.“If we had the legal right to do it, I’d do it in a heartbeat,” Trump told reporters. “I don’t know that we do. We’re looking at it right now.”On social media, Bukeleconfirmed the offer had been made, saying that he had proposed to the US “the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system” and that he was “willing to take in only convicted criminals (including convicted US citizens) into our mega-prison in exchange for a fee”.The fee, he said, would “be relatively low for the US but significant for us, making our entire prison system sustainable”.Bukelebuilt the “mega-prison”– the largest prison in the Americas – in 2023 to house alleged gang members he has imprisoned since declaring a state of exception in 2022 due to anuptick in violenceby gangs.Since 2022, Bukele has locked up more than 80,000 people – approximately 1.25% of the country’sadult population– as part of his sweeping crackdown on El Salvador’s gangs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some conspiratorial narratives circling in Brussels even suggest thatChina is using green NGOsto influence EU policy with the connivance of the European Commission.The sum of money currently being discussed as part of the EU’sLIFE programmeis small – €15.6m (£12.9m) annually, orabout 0.006%of the commission’s annual budget – but it could deprive 30 NGOs of up to 70% of their annual incomes, according tothe most recent figures.Faustine Bas-Defossez, policy director for the large and well-established European Environmental Bureau, told the Guardian that even her group would “face a struggle” without the 10% of its funding it receives from LIFE.“This is a clear attempt to undermine democracy and stifle the voices of civil society,” she said. “Those driving these attacks and accusations are often the same actors pushing to dismantle key elements of the European Green Deal – despite overwhelming scientific evidence about the urgent need to accelerate the green transition.”Groups listed as receiving more than a quarter of their funding from the €5.4bn LIFE programme last year include: ClientEarth, Carbon Market Watch, the European Cyclists Federation, Health and Environment Alliance, Organics International, the Institute for European Environmental Policy, Pesticide Action Network Europe, the Surfrider Foundation, Wetlands International and WWF Central and Eastern Europe.Carlotta Besozzi, the director of Civil Society Europe, said: “Quite a few organisations could be at risk of being shut down if their funding from LIFE is cut off because there is simply not a huge availability of other funding sources.”EU funding for NGOs is intended to counterbalance the huge amounts spent on corporate lobbying – an estimated€1.7bn in 2023. But MEPs from the European People’s Party (EPP), European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and farright blocs in parliament allege that the commission’s environmental department has secretlypaid NGOs to lobby otherswithin the EU for more ambitious policies.Monika Hohlmeier, the vice-chair of parliament’s budgetary committee, said last month that this would “impinge on essential principles such as legislative independence, transparency, avoidance of conflicts of interest, fair and impartial distribution of funds and accountability for the proper use of taxpayers’ money”. She said that the commission should end “such scandalous one-sided methods in the future and ensure that misused money is repaid”.That money might date back as far as a decade ago, according to another EPP lawmaker, Tomáš Zdechovský. He insisted that there was no intent to shut down green groups.“We don’t want to liquidate any NGOs,” he said. “We only want transparency.” The EPP had pursued the issue because “we received information from whistleblowers that these NGOs have secret contracts from the commission to lobby MEPs,” he said.Zdechovský said that he was not able to share any evidence because the EPP’s sources were “under pressure from the commission or NGOs”. However, NGOs deny the existence of any such dubious contracts.Ariel Brunner, the director of Birdlife Europe, described the charge as “a slanderous witch-hunt that has no bearing in reality. It is obviously a very dangerous attack on the basic infrastructure of European democracy.”Chris Baker, the director of Wetlands International, said the money his group received from LIFE was “not guided in any way, shape or form by what DG Environment would like us to do”.A funding cut would “diminish our presence in Brussels but not end it,” he added.Martin Dermine, the director of Pesticide Action Network Europe, also denied any impropriety, adding that while his group had other revenue sources, an end to LIFE funding could “prevent us from being present in the Brussels arena”.Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Nicholas Aiossa, the director of Transparency International EU, accused the EPP of “taking a leaf out of [Hungarian PM] Viktor Orbán’s book” in its accusations against civil society groups.“There’s no question of misuse of EU funds in this conversation. There’s no indication or evidence at all that any rules have been broken, but despite that we’ve seen a committee going around requesting dozens of contracts from NGOs and civil society actors amounting to thousands of pages to carry out one of the biggest fishing expeditions I’ve ever seen.”Ironically, Hohlmeier herself reportedlyreceives €75,000 a yearfrom Baywa, a German agricultural trading company partly funded by LIFE. She declined to be interviewed.The defunding proposal is expected to wind its way through various parliamentary committees ahead of a plenary vote on the commission’s budgetary discharge, which is expected in May.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionEuropeEuropean CommissionGreen politicsGreenhouse gas emissionsClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

The calf appeared to be a 200lb (90kg) female, but zoo staff are giving the pair time to bond before conducting a first checkup to confirm weight and sex.“We couldn’t be happier with how everything is going so far,” Steve Lefave, who oversees the zoo’s elephant program, said in the release. “This was one of the smoothest births I’ve ever seen. Rose knew just what to do. She helped her baby up right away. The kid was standing on her own within 15 minutes and took her first steps soon after that.”Rose-Tu and her baby, who is nursing regularly, are doing well, Kelsey Wallace from the zoo’s communications team said on Tuesday.The calf is Rose-Tu’s third baby. Her firstborn, 16-year-old Samudra, also lives at the zoo. Her second calf, Lily, died from a virus in 2018, just before she turned six years old.It might be a while before the new baby and Rose-Tu are ready for visitors. Staff want to make sure the calf continues to do well, and that Rose-Tu is calm and comfortable with people around, Lefave said.“Rose is a fantastic mom,” he said. “She’s so gentle and protective, and the calf is already nursing well. These are signs that they will have a strong bond, which is exactly what we want to see. We’re ready to help if needed, but so far mom and baby are doing just fine on their own.”The zoo supports a broad range of efforts to help wild elephants, and its elephant care program has spanned more than 60 years, according to its statement.Explore more on these topicsOregonPortlandZoosWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

With an American Spirit perpetually locked between his teeth, he figured fire and smoke as magical textures in his films. To Lynch, cigarettes weren’t merely delicious, but sacred: they gave him the impression of breathing in the world, then blowing it back out again with fabulous grace.Born in 1946 – 20 years before the US surgeon generalpronouncedfor the first time that cigarettes could cause cancer – Lynch came up in a time when American glamor was buttressed by cigarettes and cinema. Actors like Joan Crawford and Bette Davis danced a beautiful and foolish waltz with death, smoke in hand, while cigarettes were considered thesine qua nonof the artist’s life, an ashtray piled up with butts evidence of a good day’s work. “I always associated smoking and drinking coffee with the art life. They go hand in hand,” Lynchtoldthe Independentin 2013.Eleven years later, in hisfinal interview, Lynch revealed to People magazine that a 2020 diagnosis of emphysema, a chronic lung condition, had forced him to quit one of the great romances of his life.You can quit these things that are going to end up killing youDavid LynchTo Lydia Kiesling, a Portland-based writer and smoker, Lynch’s smoking exit interview was “more catalyzing for me than anything ever has been”. After taking up smoking at 15, Kielsing had been seesawing off and on again ever since, unable to quit a habit she’d fallen in love with (nearly70% of smokerssay they want to quit; the cessation rate is much lower, at 8.8% of smokers in 2022). Now 40, and conscious that the damage done to her lungs may be irreversible, Kiesling said that she found Lynch’s interview sobering: “To me he was a genius of living, and that included smoking, and it mattered a lot to me to see him stop.”It’s been nearly 50 days since Kiesling’s last cigarette, a number she intends to push higher followingLynch’s deathat age 78, 20 days ago. When the cravings feel particularly intense, Kiesling thinks of how smoking ruined Lynch’s health, and his stubborn love for cigarettes regardless. While Lynch always held those kinds of contradictions in his films with generosity and curiosity, he offered one unequivocal statement towards the end of his life: “You can quit these things that are going to end up killing you,” he said. Smoking is, after all, the number one preventable cause of death in the US. All of this helps Kiesling stave off cigarettes for at least one more day.View image in fullscreenNicolas Cage and Laura Dern in David Lynch’s Wild at Heart.Photograph: Polygram/Sportsphoto/AllstarTom Bardem, a 27-year-old British expat in Melbourne, Australia – also a Lynch fan and smoker – says he has witnessed a flurry of people online and in his personal life quit since Lynch’s death. “It felt like an urge to his fans to quit alongside him,” he said.While statistically, smoking is at an all-time low – less than12% of Americanssmoke today; it wasabout 41%when Lynch was born – cigarettes re-entered our cultural imagination after the pandemic. According toresearchby Smoke Free Media, depictions of smoking on screen are very much in vogue. Photos of contemporary smoking icons like Chloë Sevigny and Kate Moss regularly make the rounds on popular Instagram pages @ciginfluencers and @indiesleaze.Enfant terriblepopstars likeCharli xcxandAddison Raehave made cigarettes a core part of their brand imagery. Models walk the runwaycigarette in hand, championing the kind of luxury fatalism and art-fueled hedonism that led someone like Lynch to smoke in the first place. Smoking has become a rebuke to an era of puritanism, and of relentless self-improvement and self-surveillance. But Lynch’s death complicates this conveniently rebellious attitude.‘A one-way trip to heaven’: cigarettes were David Lynch’s magic wand – and his undoingRead more“There aren’t as many celebrities dying of smoking-related illnesses as there once were, so Lynch’s death has had a profound impact on me,” said Bardem. While he has “cut back a lot”, he’s still finding it difficult to resist the Saturday night beer and smoke. “But I do think when I eventually pack smoking in fully, I’ll look back at Lynch’s death as one of the big catalysts for me,” he said.The great smokers of Lynch’s youth – Bette Davis, Clark Gable, Betty Grable – all died terrible deaths of conditions related to smoking, and inspired smoking to be reconceived as the most wretched of societal diseases. That Lynch died still in love with his vice and in acknowledgment of how bad it was, is helping a number of smokers to put down the stick for good.“When you start you only notice what smoking gives you (social connection, focus, a reason to dip out from work). Paying attention to what it was taking away, before it got as unignorable as what Lynch is talking about, helped me quit for good,”wrotea fan on X.Others have found the strength to admit how heartbreaking their quitting is. “It’s just not good for us, and it’s OK to be really sad about that,” said Kiesling. “Maybe in the afterlife what we love is good for us.”Explore more on these topicsDavid LynchSmokingHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Eshe (Evlyne Oyedokun) hasn’t left the flat in days. Instead, she sits on her bed and rows. As her surroundings are submerged in oceanic blue light, waves crash behind her, and she swigs brandy from a hip flask. She is by herself and floating through unknown waters, but here she’s also free to express her pain on her own terms. “I want to be alone, with my own breath and that,” she says.The play, which was a finalist for theWomen’s prize for playwriting, theBruntwood prizeand theAlfred Fagon award, is a full-throttled immersion inside Eshe’s head. We hear the voice and feel the almost suffocating presence of her dead mother, Sissy (Danielle Kassaraté). The room is covered in crisp packets, empty takeaway boxes and dirty laundry, but her focus is averted elsewhere. Eshe is bombarded by text messages, and her loved ones, Ella (Olivia Nakintu)and Michael (Ivan Oyik), beg to be let into her space, but no one seems to know the right way to reach out and love her in the way she needs.View image in fullscreenOlivia Nakintu and Ivan Oyik as Ella and Michael in …blackbird hour.Photograph: Seye IsikaluAt its best, this is a formally daring 90-minute play, which pours out like urgent poetry. But, under the direction of malakaï sargeant, it takes a while for the tension to take hold. On a screen on the stage’s back wall, words are projected and then dissolve like inconsequential matter. As Eshe, Oyedokun hauntingly slurs her speech, but some of its meaning is lost in the process. The result is a dizzying painting of isolation, aided by lots of intricate design elements by Khadija Raza. The overall visual effect is powerful, but the clarity isn’t always there.By its close, the play achieves its sting as Michael and Ella transform into manic clown-like figures, almost begging for Eshe’s “mental prison” to come to an end. Both revelatory and disturbing, it leaves the theatre profoundly chilled.AtBush theatre, London, until 1 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreBush theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Within seconds I’m in tears, even though the show is a comedy: a coming-of-age story about a guy called Jack, who leaves his working-class family home and starts university. In scenes that verge on slapstick, Jack tries on various identities, attempts to lose his virginity and eventually tells his family he is gay. Yet Jack is also grieving for his father and Big Boys has moments so wrenching that you may find yourself, as I did, suddenly in pieces.Since 2022, Pointing has been putting the lad into the hit Channel 4 comedy. In a role that has made its way to front and centre, he plays Danny, Jack’s flatmate and best mate, inverting the trope of the gay best friend. At 25, Danny is a mature student: a straight blokey bloke who supports Jack in his coming out and introduces him to life as a fresher, all while struggling with his own mental health problems. When Danny comes off antidepressants in the hope his sexual performance will improve, things don’t go to plan. “Sometimes,” says Pointing, “I’d be like, ‘Does Danny have to be so horny?’” He thought the key to playing the character was to make him “too happy – trying a bit too hard to have a good time”.Explaining why the finale destroyed me would constitute a spoiler, but I can say that Danny is at the heart of it all. When I tell Pointing I had to switch it off early, because I didn’t want to talk to him with tears streaming down my face, he says people often tell him Big Boys has made them cry. “Which is strange for a comedy,” he says. But then it’s that kind of comedy: one minute you’re laughing hysterically about a performance poetry circle gone wrong; the next you’re sobbing over a resurgent wave of grief.Pointing is speaking from a bedroom filled with clothes and cats. None are his, it turns out. “I’m on baby duty today,” he says. “So I’ve had to dive into a mate’s house while they look after her downstairs.” His daughter – his first child – is five-and-a-half months old. “She’s very funny, she’s very social, she’s great.”His wife, Sarah, runs a theatre company calledFigs in Wigs. “It’s notmainstreamtheatre,” he says with a smile. “It’s slightly stranger and more surreal.” Sarah was heavily pregnant when Pointing was filming this third and last Big Boys series. “On the one hand, knowing it was the last series, I was like, ‘Savour this.’ I could feel myself wanting to remember everything. But on the other hand, my brain was being pulled away, because I was thinking, ‘The baby could happen any second.’” In the end, she arrived five days after filming finished. “Production were very grateful to Sarah for not giving birth during the shoot.”A TV producer told me I needed to find my inner Alice from The Vicar of DibleyPointing’s journey towards on-screen lad was a surprising one, especially to him. He was born in London and once said he grew up on “a slightly nicer housing estate, but still an estate” in Epsom. The LGBTQ+ community, he says, has always been a big part of his life. “My oldest childhood friend is gay, came out when we were teenagers, and my mum had gay friends. So I’m a bit more open to it. But when I met my wife, that was her gang, her tribe.”He found himself at cabaret nights, club nights and gay venues, with people fromSink the PinkandDuckie.Jack Rooke, writer and creator of Big Boys, has said Pointing knows more about queer culture than him. It all fed into his character: when Pointing started to spend time in queer spaces, he “suddenly felt the most heterosexual I’d ever felt in my life. So straight!” Before then, he’d never seen himself as particularly laddish. “I studied drama!” he jokes in a faux-theatrical voice. “I’m trying to be an actor!”As well as acting, Pointing has done standup for years. During lockdown, he put out an acclaimed comedy series on YouTube calledKey Worker, in which he played Bradley from Bromley, a joyfully enthusiastic young man (“Someone who’s comfortable not knowing things”) who volunteers at a food bank. Steve Coogan called it “warm, funny and beautifully observed”.View image in fullscreenInverting the trope of the gay best friend … with Dylan Llewellyn in the new series of Big Boys.Photograph: Patch Dolan/Channel 4When Pointing started doing live comedy, he couldn’t help comparing it with the cabaret scene. “I’m speaking generally, because I was a bit on the outskirts of both, but the comedy world isn’t as supportive. In a gay club or a queer place, the fact that someone’s got up on stage is enough – you should support them because it is a huge deal for them.Comedyis a bit more like, ‘Right, if you’re even a little bit shit, you’re getting it.’” He preferred the people he met in queer spaces. “So that became my friendship group as well, because I found it a really lovely place to be.”One of his first TV jobs was 2017’sPls Like, an early satire on influencer culture. “I played a sort of vapid, cheery, cheeky chappy – but I didn’t think that’s what I was.” How did he see himself then? “I did want to do comedy, but I saw myself as a bit morose, a bit serious.” He soon realised “there’s this distance between how you see yourself and how the rest of the world sees you”. He does an impression of “every casting I ever had”, turning Cheeky Chappy up to full volume:“Is there gonna be girls there? I’m not gonna go if there’s gonna be no girls.”He laughs. “That was basically it.”Why does he think he gives that impression? “Maybe it’s partly my looks, a little bit my accent? Most of the people going up for those roles were middle class, maybe a bit more than that. So maybe there weren’t as many people like me doing it. Once you know that, you lean into it.” In his early comedy days, he used to do “a preening acting coach. He was based on my lecturers at uni and a couple of my mum’s ex-boyfriends. Made out he was a sensitive guy but actually he was a creep.”One night, a producer came up to him after a show. “He said, ‘It’s great, but I think you need to find your Alice from The Vicar of Dibley.’” Alice was the sitcom’s ditsy clown. “Basically, that’s how he saw me: you need to find your silly, goofy ... And that kind of is what happened.”View image in fullscreen‘Right, you’re getting it!’ … Ponting performing standup at the Moth Club in London.Photograph: Claire Haigh/UKTVNow Pointing has become a regular face on TV. He’s done plenty of comedy (Plebs, Starstruck), comedy-drama (Smothered), period drama (Agatha Christie adaptation Murder Is Easy) and drama (Queenie, Sweetpea). His next project is a Harlan Coben blockbuster for Netflix. Although he is less often typecast, it does still happen. “I definitely get roles where they just want you to do what you’ve done, but without any of the depth. There’s no point me playing a version of Danny for half an episode of something. It seems to cheapen it, really, if I just turn up in everyone’s show as a lad.”And Danny is far more complicated than that. He’s as sensitive as Jack (who is played by Dylan Llewellyn) but lacks a strong family to support him. His father is a deadbeat and his cousin is in prison. In gay clubs, Pointing says, people often come up to him. “They give me a hug, they say ‘Thank you, I love this’, and quote something.” But in other places, he notices that men send their girlfriends over to talk to him instead. He sees the irony in the fact that some men struggle to talk about how much they love Danny, a man who struggles to talk. “That happens quite a lot. That’s when I’m like, ‘There is obviously still a long way to go.’ It’s so deeply entrenched, isn’t it?”He is including himself in that judgement. “I think I’m quite good at talking, and as you can see, you can’t shut me up sometimes. But I do struggle to articulate myself at times. Or I just don’t. Somewhere along the way, men – or boys – just sort of go off and don’t really talk about things. It’s weird.” He pauses. “I don’t know how we fix that.”‘Phoebe Waller-Bridge just asked me to write her a play’: Big Boys creator Jack Rooke on going stratosphericRead moreAt 38, Pointing is a decade older than his character, and as the show ends, his own life is changing dramatically, too. “Knowing I was about to have a baby,” he says, “and knowing my life was about to move into this next chapter, it felt quite pertinent.” He felt he was waving goodbye to his own youth – a youth that was “heavily extended thanks to Big Boys”.But after three series, he was ready to grow up. “Because, as I say, in real life I feel like I am graduating from these roles.” So we’re going to find out how the cheeky chappy evolves? “Yeah! What sort of bloke will that be? What sort of man? I guess we’ll find out.”Pointing has to go – he’s on baby duty, after all. Afterwards, I watch the rest of the finale. Pointing had promised me that Rooke had pulled off a “masterstroke”. All I can say is he’s not wrong.Big Boys is on Channel 4 on 9 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTV comedyComedyTelevisionSexualityinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The National’s submission is Inter Alia, about a judge whose son is accused of rape. The play will be staged this summer in the Lyttelton theatre, starring Rosamund Pike in the lead role. It is written by Australian playwright Suzie Miller, who had a hit with her previous legal drama, Prima Facie, starring Jodie Comer.The Almeida is represented by Otherland, which opens at the north London theatre this month. Written by Chris Bush, whose previous productions include the Sheffield musical Standing at the Sky’s Edge, it is billed as an exploration of “what it means to be true to yourself in the face of unstoppable change”. The cast includes Jade Anouka and Fizz Sinclair.The RSC has already staged the script it submitted for the prize. Playwright Isobel McArthur, best known for her raucous Jane Austen riff Pride and Prejudice* (*sort of), directed her version of The Fair Maid of the West as a Christmas show in the Swan theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, in 2023. It is a musical updating of Thomas Heywood’s 17th-century play of the same name.The Guardian’s David Jayswrote that McArthur had made “a rollicking new romp from a baggy old play”.Other plays on the shortlist offer fresh takes on classic tales. BÁN by Carys Coburn, submitted by Dublin’sAbbey theatre, is inspired by Federico García Lorca’s The House of Bernarda Alba and set in 1980s Ireland. The Janeiad by Anna Ziegler, submitted by the Alley theatre in Houston, draws on the Odyssey, with Penelope becoming New Yorker Jane, whose husband left home 20 years ago.The remaining finalists, chosen from more than 200 submissions, are 49 Days, a play about grief by Haruna Lee, submitted by Playwrights Horizons in New York; An Oxford Man by Else Went, about “the first ‘modern’ transgender man”, from South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa, California; Furlough’s Paradise by ak payne, charting the relationship between two cousins (Alliance theatre of Atlanta); and Keiko Green’s “genre-defying” You Are Cordially Invited to the End of the World (UC San Diego MFA Playwriting Programme).The winner will be announced on 10 March and awarded $25,000 and a signed print by Willem de Kooning. The judges are: costume designer Linda Cho; actors Indira Varma and Jennifer Ehle; Nancy Medina, artistic director of the Bristol Old Vic; playwright Mark Ravenhill; and George Strus, who founded the new work development and community building hubBreaking the Binary theatrein New York.Past winners of the prize include Annie Baker, Caryl Churchill and Lynn Nottage. Last year, it was won by Ava Pickett’s “very funny and very angry” play1536, which follows three women as they discuss the arrest of Anne Boleyn.1536 opens at the Almeida in May.Explore more on these topicsTheatreAwards and prizesNational TheatreAbbey theatreRoyal Shakespeare CompanyAlmeida theatreShareReuse this content"

When I first saw Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain in 2005 – a movie I’d been anticipating since a “gay cowboy” project was announced – my response was subdued. I remember telling a friend who’d asked what I thought that it was beautiful in the way a landscape painting is beautiful: lush and precisely detailed but emotionally spare. These days I can’t hear the opening strains of Gustavo Santaolalla’s poignant score without weeping.Beautiful landscape is, of course, a central feature of the film, tantalising and talismanic. The quietly stunning Wyoming countryside is not only where our cowboys fall in love – mercurial and passionate Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and taciturn and self-loathing Ennis del Mar (Heath Ledger) – it represents the kind of emotional freedom and acceptance they can’t find in the prosaic interiors of their upbringing. Brokeback Mountain (a fictional location invented by the author Annie Proulx in the award-winning short story on which the film is based) releases something in the men, then mocks them for not living up to its Edenic promise.View image in fullscreenJake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain.Photograph: Reuters/Focus FeaturesIt’s highly significant that the film opens in 1963 and spans a 20-year period of marriages, kids and divorce before ending in secrecy and heartbreak. This was a time of enormous progress for gay men in the US who’d fought for and won legal protections across the country. But for Jack and Ennis – who can’t even conceive of a world that tolerates, let alone actively celebrates, their love – this progress might as well be happening on the moon. It’s a salient reminder that what we think of as an LGBTQI+ community is largely a metropolitan, middle-class construct.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThose long opening scenes on Brokeback – where the men herd sheep, wash clothes in the river and make love in a tent – unfold languorously, as if taking their cue from the natural world; the pacing here is stately, deliberate. But as the men return to their separate lives and deep dive into the deception of heterosexuality, time seems to quicken. No sooner do we see Ennis marrying Alma (Michelle Williams) in a pokey Riverton chapel than the couple are drowning under the domestic weight of kids, bills and dead-end jobs. Jack’s furtive “romance” with Lureen (Anne Hathaway, all angles and eye rolls) also proceeds at a pace, as if keen to paper over cracks. Lee does this often in the film, telescoping time whenever the men are away from the mountain; the effect is of whole lives slipping through the protagonists’ fingers.One of the things that strikes me rewatching the film is how specific and tactile the worlds Lee brings to life are (aided enormously by the production designer Judy Becker); from the shoddy trailers and rusted pick-ups of Ennis’s existence to the depressing austerity of Jack’s family home. Lee has always been a master of mise en scène; he uses it not just to locate and excavate character but to suggest elaborate and highly charged social milieux. This is vital in a film like Brokeback Mountain, where societal conventions are as immutable and constrictive as gravity. What we now understand as toxic masculinity, its stultifying narrowness and self-inflicting misery, pervades every frame; rigid constructs surrounding gender are as scrupulously upheld as anything in Edith Wharton or Henry James.The cast are superb, the whole film littered with performances of astonishing depth and suppleness. I’d forgotten Kate Mara’s emergent, wide-eyed Alma Jr, wondering what exactly it is that keeps her father at arm’s length. David Harbour and Anna Faris as hopelessly entrapped married couple Randall and Lashawn Malone. Williams is heartbreaking, doe-eyed and desperate and Hathaway is terrific, her insouciance hardening to steel in the face of her husband’s vast unknowability.View image in fullscreenMichelle Williams as Alma and Heath Ledger as Ennis Del Mar.Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/AlamyStraight actors playing gay characters might have become more controversial since the film’s release (although it’s hardly in abeyance) but this never bothered me much because I could always feel the abiding respect and compassion coming from the entire creative team. Gyllenhaal and Ledger don’t “play gay” at all; the boys’ sexuality isn’t an identity to them, but something akin to a topographical detail, as inscrutable as a mountain.Gyllenhaal is brilliant as the tortured and tenacious Jack, allowing hints of another, freer self to shine through the increasing bitterness and despair. When Brokeback was released, the US film critic Gene Shalit called Jack“a sexual predator”– which highlights the straight world’s willingness to see criminality in gay desire – but he’s really a lover in the high romantic sense, chivalric and steadfast. Ledger’s Ennis is an inversion of Jack, his chivalry petrified into stoicism and self-denial. He mumbles and shuffles, hemmed and corralled like one of the sheep, his jaw locked and his gaze shifting. It’s a remarkable portrait of a young man disappearing into himself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That decision looks downright silly now, as Lee’s film has taken its rightful place among cinema’s masterpieces, entering the Library of Congress’s National Film Registry in 2018 for being “culturally, historically or aesthetically significant”.

Cautionary, richly imaginative and deeply, unexpectedly humane, it was both utterly unputdownable and a welcome relief from the current resignation to dystopia.I’ve also been taking delight inEdward Carey’s glorious novelEdith Holler. Set in a Norwich that is at once fictional, historical and fantastical, he transports the reader into the world of brilliant 12-year-old Edith who is cursed to never leave her family’s tumbledown theatre … until fate decides otherwise. Filled with the author’s witty, curious observations and alive with his own illustrations, it’s a novel like no other.I’ve been a Simon Russell Beale fan ever since, as a teenager, I first saw him in The Duchess of Malfi back in the 90s. So imagine my excitement when his memoir,A Piece of Work, appeared in the bookshops. It threads around every Shakespearean role he’s performed – from Desdemona at school to his famous Richard III, his unforgettable Hamlet and beyond. It’s a fascinating, hands-on view.The City Changes Its Face by Eimear McBrideis published by Faber (£20). To support the Guardian and Observer, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

I felt as if I was being guided in one direction, only to be sent off on a detour, as O’Hagan unveiled the different layers of his central character’s life. At times, I felt like I was being drawn into an unsettling dystopian world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The latter is a wholly unique, beautifully muscled contemplation on the prism of silence and black interiority which really resonated with me. I also found Femi’s collection very moving, with its acute, truthful and loving observation of the lives of black boys on the North Peckham Estate in London.I Want to Talk to You by Diana Evansis published by Chatto & Windus (£18.99).

The first wasThe OutrunbyAmy Liptrot, a beautiful and emotional memoir that tells the story of the author’s childhood on Orkney, her move to London, and her return to Orkney aged 30 as a recovering alcoholic. Returning to the Scottish island, she reconnects with the power of the land and sea, and Orkney’s history, culture and people. An immersive personal journey that reminds the reader of the healing and magical power of nature.The second book I loved lately wasThe New Lifeby Tom Crewe, a fictional account of the lives of John Addington Symonds and Henry Havelock Ellis, who wrote the first English medical textbook about homosexuality, Sexual Inversion.

Her task is simply to waste the time of the people who are trying to scam her.O2 rolled out “AI granny” Daisy for a short period to show what could be done with artificial intelligence to counter the scourge of scammers who have become so ubiquitous.Using a mixture of ambivalence, confusion about how computers work and an eagerness to reminisce about her younger days, the “78 years young” Daisy draws sighs and snapping from fraudsters on the other end of the line.In one call O2 released, a scammer tries to take control of her computer after telling her it is riddled with viruses. He is kept on the line while she looks for her glasses and bumbles about trying to turn the machine on and find the Internet Explorer icon.3:26'I'm a bit lost now': Daisy the AI bot speaks to scammer – video“You know, back in my day we didn’t have all this technology. Everything was much simpler. What about you, dear?” she says. When he reacts with anger, saying that her “profession is bothering people”, Daisy says: “I wouldn’t want to bother anyone. I’m just trying to have a little chat.”Another call has a scammer again trying to take control of her computer, but Daisy delays by talking about how she usually just uses it for knitting patterns and recipes for scones. “I see a lot of options, dear. It says things like back, forward, reload and, oh, what’s this? Save as. How do I find the homepage?” she asks.When a third scammer tries to get her to download the Google Play Store, she replies: “Dear, did you say pastry? I’m not really on the right page.” She then complains that her screen has gone blank, saying it has “gone black like the night sky”.“If you are wasting our time, ma’am, you are going to lose your money because someone is trying to take your money and we are trying to upgrade your security,” says the exasperated scammer.View image in fullscreen‘Do you have any lovely pastries in your area? I do adore a good scone.’Photograph: Islandstock/AlamyWhen she tries to find the icon the scammer is asking her to press, she says: “I see a triangle icon, but I’m not sure if it’s the right one. It could be a slice of pie. You know, my eyesight isn’t what it used to be. Let me just squint at it.”“Do you have any lovely pastries in your area? I do adore a good scone,” she adds.Behind the affable “hoping to” is an AI system which has been trained on real scam calls, said Virgin Media O2’s marketing director, Simon Valcarcel.“It knows exactly the tactics to look out for, exactly the type of information to give to keep the scammers online and waste time,” he said.The company worked with Jim Browning, a “scam baiter” whoposts videos of himselfwasting the time of criminals, to plant phone numbers on websites where they were likely to be found by fraudsters hoping to scam people. They included sites promoting competitions where the prizes appear “too good to be true”.They then waited for the scam calls to start coming in – and, sure enough, after a few days they did. The results were then recorded on a laptop.Over a few weeks, Daisy wasted each fraudster’s time for up to 40 minutes when they could otherwise have been scamming real people.Rather than be rolled out on a much wider scale, however, Valcarcel said the project was aimed at raising awareness. Some of the scammers eventually guessed they were talking to an AI bot, but future versions could use many different types of accent and persona for Daisy.Many fraudsters work in call centres, and if one has no luck in getting information from their victim, their details will be passed on to another, according to findings from the project. In one case, Daisy was passed between four different callers.Artificial intelligence is being used to combat fraud across many industries now, according to Serpil Hall at Celebrus, a technology firm that deals with fraud and scams.It is used in banking to identify unauthorised transactions and identity fraud, in insurance to verify claims, in travel to monitor unusual booking patterns and in public services to identify things such as anomalies in tax filings, she said.Explore more on these topicsScamsConsumer affairsArtificial intelligence (AI)featuresShareReuse this content"

Unfortunately, I have two dogsTim DowlingTue 4 Feb 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2025 01.03 ESTShareThey are sometimes advertised as “human kennels” but they are all versions of the same dubious innovation: a plush dog bed big enough for humans and their pets to share. “The perfect spot for quality bonding time,” as one online offer puts it.I already have a big bed that I share with my dog. It’s in my bedroom and it’s called my bed. The dog also has a dog bed in the same room, to which she retires obediently every night. But every morning I wake up with her lying next to me, under the covers headfirst, back legs resting on the pillow. Only one of us thinks of this as quality bonding time.Many people think you shouldn’t sleep in the same bed as your dog and I agree with them. They say dogs are unclean. I’m like, tell me about it. We’ve got lots of dedicated dog beds in our house and they are all completely disgusting, unless you’re a dog. This is why I can’t quite see the appeal of a human-sized dog bed. I can’t imagine wanting to sleep with dogson their terms.The Lidl version of the human kennel, the Silentnight Cosy Cuddles Snuggle Pod, is £69.99 and long enough for a 6ft man to stretch out lengthwise. It’s a niche bit of decor – you could live in quite a big house and still have nowhere to put it. But fresh from the box, before my dog has been anywhere near it, it looks pretty inviting.And it is comfortable, although you’ll probably want a pillow or two if you’re not used to sleeping curled up with your nose tucked under your hind leg. With a blanket, you might even accommodate an overnight human guest in it.The dog, however, regards the Snuggle Pod with profound suspicion: forbidden furniture masquerading as a dog bed; a giant mixed message.“It’s fine,” I say, tugging on her collar. “It’s for an article. Get in.”View image in fullscreenSnuggling … eventually, the big dog fell asleep too.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianThe other dog, the small dog, wanders over, sniffs the bed, vaults the edge and commandeers a corner. Finally, the big dog is persuaded to come aboard, but she sits awkwardly, facing away from me and stealing the odd sidelong glance.“Relax,” I say. “You’re ruining this for me.”The Snuggle Pod cover is removable and washable, which is probably disappointing for a dog. It is billed as “the ultimate cosy night in solution”, and is said to be targeted primarily at gen Z, with their celebrated contempt for socialising. Some promotional pictures don’t even have dogs in them – just contented singletons wearing headphones – which sort of elevates the appeal. It’s the ultimate cosy night in solution for when your dog is out.Eventually the big dog lies down and stretches out. As undisgusting as it is, she seems to see the point at last. She looks around the giant plush pod as if thinking: this will do nicely, once it’s filthy.Then she falls fast asleep on my arm. Of the three of us now sharing the Snuggle Pod, I am the only one not snoring. I lie there, staring at the ceiling, wishing I’d had the foresight to point the bed toward the television before I climbed in.Explore more on these topicsPetsDogsSleepfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Stir in 80g ofraisins.Beat together 1 largeeggand 2 tbsp ofmilk.Put 180g ofgoldensyrup, 70g ofblacktreacle, 125g ofbutterand 125g ofsoftbrownsugarinto a small saucepan and leave to melt over a moderate heat. Stir into the flour mixture.Now stir in the beaten egg and milk, making sure there are no lumps of flour, and pour into the lined baking tin. Bake for 40 minutes until springy to the touch.Carefully slice the skin and white pith from a couple of large blood oranges. Slice each orange thinly.Cut the cake into 9 pieces – it is quite a shallow cake – then place 1 piece on each plate, a few slices of oranges to the side and finally serve with a little crème fraîche or whipped cream.When you have added the last of the ingredients, the cake mixture will be more soft and runny than is usual. That is exactly as it should be for this recipe. Don’t be tempted to add any more flour.If you leave the cake to go cold, you can wrap it in foil and keep it in an airtight container for up to a week.Cut into squares or discs using a 7cm cookie cutter.Follow Nigel on Instagram@NigelSlaterExplore more on these topicsDessertNigel Slater's midweek dinnerFoodOrangefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.We could be in south-east Asia, but this fairytale world of time-honoured custom and lives lived close to the land is a lot nearer home – in south-eastern Europe.We are in Romania’s Maramureș region, close to the Ukraine border, driving through rolling hills whose gonk-like haystacks give the countryside a cosy feel, as if it’s peopled with friendly long-haired beings.Romania mapAnd we’ll get to sleep in one of those old wooden houses thanks to an energetic pair of German immigrants. Volker Bulitta and his architect wife Lilli Steier came to the area on a hiking holiday just months after the 1989 revolution and fell in love with it. There were no tourist maps in those post-Communist days, and the few hotels were dire, but local people offered a warm welcome, generously sharing their homes and communal pots of stew. They were soon regular visitors to the village of Botiza, and in 2005 bought the land that is now the heart of their Şesuri estate, and an old wooden house to renovate.A common wedding wish in Romania isCasă de piatră(I wish you a house of stone), because that represents progress and security. For years no one wanted to live in a wooden home like their grandparents, and beautiful examples lay neglected everywhere. Lilli and Volker started buying them and reassembling them on their land – with modern comforts. Lilli became an expert in traditional construction.Now there are four guest cottages on the 100-hectare estate. Ours is 200-year-oldCasa Palaga, which has original ceilings and doors, a huge sitting room with books, art and handmade rugs, and ladder-like steps to two bedrooms and a modern bathroom. A ceramic stove keeps it cosy at night, though the spring sunshine is warm.The first morning we set out to walk the estate, admiring wild woods of oak and silver birch, a clear stream in its rocky bed and hundreds of butterflies, as well as Volker and Lilli’s organically reared horses, goats, buffaloes and friendly, vocal herd of highland cattle.View image in fullscreenInside one of the wooden houses on the Şesuri estate.Photograph: Sorin MorarThe estate meadows are gently mowed with hand scythes, which means in spring they are a riot of rare orchids, marsh marigolds, gladioli and purply-blue salvia that look like giant bluebells. Autumn means wild mushrooms, which guests are encouraged to gather. Lilli, an expert on these as on much else, will advise on those safe to eat. Brown bears, wolves, lynx, wild cats, otters and deer populate the nearby hills. We see no sign of these, but spot what I swear is an eagle high above. We hear a chiffchaff’s distinctive call and listen for hoopoes and orioles arriving from Africa.The otherworldly nature of Maramureș is underlined by its extraordinary churches and monasteries. With steep roofs and impossibly tall turrets, watchtowers and the slenderest spires – all tiled in wood – they look as if CGI whiz kids from Amazon’s Rings of Power were trying to win a bet with Disney.The estate meadows are gently mowed with hand scythes, which means in spring they are a riot of rare orchidsOur walk takes us past Botiza’s monastery, a very elvish complex of pointy towers and swooping wooden arcades, and over the following days we take in several more. A short distance east, Leud church is the oldest of the area’s eight Unesco-listed wooden churches. Built in 1628, it has a double-layer roof, and every inch of its interior is exuberantly painted with saints, devils, animals, trees and flowers.TheMaramureș Village Museumin Sighet, about 25 miles west, has a collection of wooden houses from several districts and centuries, rebuilt on site along a winding lane. Hearing that the three-metre-wide oak planks that make up the walls of the oldest house there, from the early 1500s, were from trees planted just as the Roman empire was collapsing puts our short human lives into context.View image in fullscreenCiorbă – traditional Romanian meatball soup.Photograph: Florin P/AlamyAs does the region’s quirkiest attraction – the Happy Cemetery in Săpânța, farther west again. Death is part of life is its cheerful message. The site is crowded with carved wooden grave markers bearing bright naive paintings of that occupant’s life – weaving, cooking, teaching, bookkeeping, lumberjacking – or death, in a road accident, say, all by local artistStan Ioan Pătraș. One begs visitors to speak quietly so as not to wake his harridan of a mother-in-law, buried nearby, who will make his life a misery even in death.That churches are all well-kept and -used tells of the importance Orthodox Christianity has in the area, but this has knock-on benefits for anyone worried that eastern European country food might be stodgy and meat-heavy. Strict fasting rules in Orthodox lent (3 March-19 April this year) prohibit meat for the whole period, and dairy or eggs on many days, which means local food includes tasty vegan dishes, such aszacuscă, a sort of spreadable ratatouille, and spicy red chilli jam.I have fast fibre-optic internet indoors, but people passing by outside with a horse and cart. It’s so coolThese are found in home cooking, mostly. The Ceaușescu years are long over, but there’s still no dining-out culture in rural areas. There’s a village shop in Botiza for basic supplies, but no cafe, bar or restaurant. However, we’re cheered to learn that its handful ofpensiunea(guesthouses) do dinner for non-residents. At Cretuca, just down the road, we are the only customers in a dining room hung with folk art, and for under £10 a head tuck into a set menu ofciorbă, traditional sour vegetable soup, then tender slices of stewed beef with mash and a big dish of gherkins. And though Romania is a big wine producer, the table is set with a jug of schnapps (“for the man”), and another of blueberry liqueur – for me, apparently.View image in fullscreenA world of time-honoured custom and lives lived close to the land.Photograph: Sorin MorarWe don’t stray far fromCasa Palagain our final days: loungers and a hammock slung between trees offer great valley views, hydrangeas and lavender are starting to flower, and wood smoke curls above the village. There’s anotherpensiuneato try – in nearby Poienile – where we eat festive favouritesarmales(cabbage rolls with pork and rice) and another variety ofciorbă, and we drop in on Maria, who is keeping alive the regional weaving tradition.“This is winter work,” says the former teacher, showing how she spins raw wool, dyes it with, say, mint, walnuts, red onions, cherry juice or nettles, then uses a hand loom and patterns drawn on squared paper to make blankets, rugs and clothing. “It’s more pleasure than labour,” she adds. “I feel much happier like this – my hands busy with wool and plants, rather than phone and laptop.”But despite these timeless elements, Romania is far from stuck in the past. Its tech sector is booming, and the country hassome of the highest internet speeds in Europe. The cute wooden houses could play a part in its future too. Last year saw record heatwaves in Romania, but a neighbour who has a wooden house rebuilt to Lilli’s specifications is very happy. “When it’s 35C outside, it’s a pleasant 23C inside, as wood is a great insulator.

For most of that time we have had to pay annual service charges of more than £4,000 – £2,000 in council tax, and £2,000 in interest on unpaid care home fees which the sale of the flat was meant to fund.It seems retirement apartments are incredibly difficult to sell. In his particular development, owned by Pegasus, a third of the flats were either emptyor being sublet.Two identical flats to my father’s have also just been sold formuch less than the original purchase price. Every time I drive past a new retirement development I feel like shouting, “Don’t do it, you won’t be able to sell!”AJ, OxfordYour father paid £252,000 for his flat in the Fleur-de-Lis complex in Abingdon eight years ago and you have had to sell for £122,000. While waiting to achieve that paltry sum, you have racked up service and other charges of more than £50,000 – money sorely needed to pay for your father’s nursing home fees.It’s unsurprising that only 0.6% of over-65s in the UK live in retirement complexes, according to figures from the government’s Older People’s Housing Taskforce, compared with 10 times that number in the US and Australia.Properties are sold on a lease, usually 125 years, and the value can diminish along with the lease length. Service charges can be significant, payable whether or not the purchaser is in residence; ground rent is often levied;substantial feesmay kick in when a property is sold or sublet; and the age restrictions limit the pool of potential buyers. In your father’s complex, the age range is restricted to over-65s.Fleur-de-Lis tells me your ­experience was “unique” and says the pandemic had initially had an impact on viewings. “Over the last 18 months, our resales team have achieved an average resale value of 91% of the original purchase price, which, given wider housing market conditions, is expected,” it says.According to Sebastian O’Kelly from the campaign group Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, “retirement housing has resulted in massive wealth erosion for thousands of families”. He suggests people consider alternatives, such as some form of shorter tenancy or guaranteed buyback.I say anyone tempted to buy into a complex should study the fees and restrictions in the lease, and check out what price resales are fetching before committing.Email your.problems@observer.co.uk.

Photograph: Czarek Sokołowski/APPoland says it is under attack from its eastern neighbour, and its razor-wire fence reflects EU’s harsher migration stanceByJennifer Rankinin Czeremcha, PolandTue 4 Feb 2025 09.27 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2025 09.29 ESTShareThe fence is five and a half metres high and bristles with jagged rolls of razor wire. Armed soldiers stand guard, surveying the snowy forest, still and silent on a frigid winter’s day. Cameras atop the fence are scanning the ground, sending footage back to the nearby HQ, which is on alert 24 hours a day.The fence was not built to keep out an invading army, but people desperate to get to Europe. Once a checkpoint for cars and lorries, Poland’s border withBelarusis now a militarised zone: a steel and wire demonstration of the EU’s increasingly hardline stance towards undocumented people.At the same site are anti-tank barriers, as the government tests elements of Eastern Shield, a system of fortifications, ditches and defences being built to guard against Russian aggression. Poland’s eastern frontier is now patrolled by 6,000 soldiers, 2,200 border guards and police.“For our government the absolute top priority is the protection of our border and security of our territory,” said Maciej Duszczyk, an undersecretary of state at Poland’s interior ministry, while stressing the “humanitarian face” of the operation towards people trying to enter the country, such as search and rescue teams.The 115-mile (186km) fence was built after Belarus’s dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, beganluring people from the Middle East and Africa to his countryin 2021 and busing them to the Polish border. Poland says it is under attack, facing “hybrid warfare” from its eastern neighbour, Lukashenko’s response toEU sanctions imposed on Belarusfor crushing mass protests against his rule. The Podlaski Border Guard, which is responsible for manning Poland’s frontier with Belarus, reported 29,707 irregular crossings in 2024, higher than the two previous years.View image in fullscreenThe fence at Połowce-Pieszczatka, an area deep in the secure zone.Photograph: Jennifer Rankin/The GuardianThe Guardian joined a group of about 60 journalists invited by the Polish government to visit the fence at Połowce-Pieszczatka, an area deep in a secure zone and off limits to anyone without a special permit.The exclusion zone, which runs along a 38-mile stretch of the border, was reintroduced by Donald Tusk’s centre-right government in June. Officials say the restrictions stop people smugglers from collecting people at the border and driving them to other EU countries. Critics say the zone throws a veil of secrecy over how asylum seekers are treated and criminalises those trying to help them.For visiting reporters, everything looked orderly, from the soft toys in cots in the empty foreigner registration centre, to the PowerPoint slides detailing asylum applications (2,685 in 2024 at that centre, which compares with 16,900 across Poland).Map of buffer zoneIn the depths of the forested, often swampy terrain outside, however, people speak of a different reality. Dahir, a 17-year-old boy originally from Somalia, told Polish aid workers that he was shot with rubber bullets by Polish border guards as he attempted to cross the frontier last October. He and a Somali travelling companion were beaten and kicked, while a dog was set on a third Syrian man, he said.Dahir said the group were strip-searched to their underwear and had phones and shoes confiscated and destroyed, before being forced to cross back to Belarus in a swampy area. Their pleas to file asylum claims were brutally dismissed: “They would hit us or punch us or kick us and this led us not to bring up a conversation with them further.” He said he was pushed back seven times from Poland to Belarus and twice from Latvia.Dahir’s testimony is recounted in a report by the NGO We Are Monitoring, which describes pushbacks as “an everyday practice of the Polish border guard”. The report, which was published in English on Tuesday, is a grim tale of people forced into a harsh no man’s land between the Polish and Belarusian fences and spending days, even weeks, trapped in Europe’s last primeval forests without food or shelter.Its 13 interviewees make allegations of Polish border guards restraining hands with zip ties, beating bodies, smashing phones, chasing people with dogs, pepper spraying faces, confiscating coats and shoes after strip-searches, and throwing people into swamps and rivers back over the border.View image in fullscreenAccording to the Polish government, people trying to cross the border in 2024 came from 51 different countries.Photograph: Czarek Sokołowski/APDuszczyk said people chose to return to Belarus because they did not want to seek asylum in Poland, preferring to try another clandestine entry. Under EU rules, an asylum seeker must claim protection in the first country they arrive in. “They don’t want to stay in Poland. They want to join families or employers in different countries,” the deputy minister added.Pressed further on pushbacks, Duszczyk said: “We have to trust the border guards and soldiers. They do their job as well as possible. But it is a very difficult situation.”The interior ministry did not respond to a request for further comment on specific allegations.Uriel Mazzoli, the head of mission for Médecins Sans Frontières in Poland, described the claim of voluntary returns as“very inaccurate”, adding that most MSF patients were “very afraid” to be returned to Belarus. MSF has treated 442 people in more than two years at the border. The group encounters three kinds of ailment: direct physical assaults, such as injuries from rubber bullets and dog bites; injuries caused by the fence, such as falls or cuts from razor wire; and illnesses caused by the extreme and harsh environment, such as hypothermia, frostbite, gastrointestinal diseases and dehydration.Anna Alboth, a cofounder of Grupa Granica (a coalition that encompasses We Are Monitoring), said she had met more than 100 people – men, women and children – who had experienced at least one pushback, with some reporting many more. Last September the Council of Europe’s commissioner for human rights called on Polish authorities “toput a stop to all summary returns to Belarus”, citing “credible allegations of isolated acts of misconduct” by some border guards.View image in fullscreenThe buffer zone was reintroduced last June after a young soldier was fatally stabbed by a man seeking to cross the border.Photograph: Jennifer Rankin/The GuardianRefugee groups have been bitterly disappointed by Tusk’s government, which ended the eight-year rule of the nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS). In opposition, Tusk accused PiS of wanting “to strip us of our humanity”. In office he sounded a harsher note,describing migration as “a question of the survival of our western civilisation”.Policy has also hardened. The Tusk government passed a law allowingsecurity forces to use lethal weapons with impunitywhen faced with a threat and has proposedtemporary suspensions of the right to asylum.The buffer zone was reintroduced last June after ayoung soldier was fatally stabbed by a man seeking to cross the border, a death mourned across Poland. “He gave his life for us, for our homeland,” said the president, Andrzej Duda, who attended the funeral.Col Andrzej Stasiulewicz, the deputy commander of the Podlaski Border Guard division, said guards were facing “strong and high aggression” from people trying to enter Poland. He played a video clip that he said showed 80 people attempting to cross the border, nearly all armed with a club or piece of wood. Another video was said to show 240 people trying to enter by force. The journeys were “organised at every stage by Belarus”, he said.Alboth said she had never encountered any aggression, but heard stories from asylum seekers that they were instructed to gather in groups by Belarusian officers and ordered to throw stones at the Polish fence, with threats of rape made against their wives for noncompliance. “From the refugee perspective, there is absolutely no reason to be aggressive towards Poland,” she said.According to the Polish government, people trying to cross the border in 2024 came from 51 different countries, with the greatest numbers from Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia and Syria.Mazzoli said there was “a manipulation of the narrative of hybrid warfare to justify the suspension of fundamental human rights”. The Polish government’s portrayal of the situation meant people fleeing war were considered as threats, but he added: “They are not soldiers, they are not weapons, they are people.”Explore more on these topicsPolandBelarusEuropean UnionMigrationEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Inevitably, many end up in landfills.“A lot of the stuff comes actually way smaller than you expect,” Armacost said. “I bought a desk lamp, except it can fit in my hands.”In the months before Trump took office, shoppers urged each other to stock up on Temu and Shein, in case the new administration followed through on its promise to tax US trade partners. “Kinda feeling emo bc this may be the last good Black Friday for a while because of the tariffs,” one TikTok user wrote in aclip. “Better collect your ‘vintage Shein’ because they will probably go for $100 next year.’”Two days after the election, the fashion writer Amy Odellwarned readersof price hikes in a post to her BackRow Substack titled: “Trump Won. So Shop Now.” Susan Scafidi, a lawyer and founder of Fordham’s Fashion Law Institute, told Odell: “Everything’s going to be more expensive, which is a little crazy when you realize that a lot of the Trump appeal was with regard to the economy.”Could the tariff kill fast fashion, an industry defined by wasteful over-consumption, as we know it? No, says Margaret Bishop, a textile and apparel specialist and professor at New York’s Parsons School of Design and the Fashion Institute of Technology. “If anything, I think these tariffs will strengthen fast fashion’s hold on customers,” she said. “If everything costs more, particularly food, transportation and housing, they’re going to have to cut back somewhere.“Americans have a real hunger for new fashion, so they will trade down to be able to continue to buy things. If a $1 pack of T-shirts at Temu becomes $2 a pack, that’s still cheaper than spending $20 for a couple of T-shirts that are better made,” she continued.Sheng Lu, a professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware, agreed that tariffs would not “fundamentally shift” Americans’ love of a good, if sketchy, deal. While small businesses will bear most of the pain from tariffs – due to supply chain snarls or the fact that Americans won’t be able to spend as much – larger corporations such as Shein and Temu tend to absorb costs.“These companies are resourceful,” Lu said. “My more immediate concern is that small and medium-sized enterprises won’t survive, or will face significant challenges.”Big tech to tungsten: what industries are the focus of China’s new US tariffs?Read moreIn 2023, a US congressionalreportalleged that there was an “extremely high risk” that Temu used forced labor in its supply chain, and that both Shein and Temu evaded US human rights reviews. (Shein denied these claims at the time, while Temu did not comment on the report.) A recentreportfrom the Swiss advocacy group Public Eye found that some Shein workers endure 75-hour work weeks. (Shein told the BBC it was “working hard” to address the issues raised in the report.)The fast-fashion industry is alsosynonymouswith high carbon emissions and pollution.Lu fears that tariffs will exacerbate these issues. “If they have to pay more on tariff duties but at the same time make their prices competitive, that’s not good news for workers or the environmental impact, because companies will have more incentive to cut corners,” he said.Armacost knows that these e-commerce giants represent the worst of Americans’ desire for excess. “But also, at the same time, spendingdoesstimulate the economy,” she said. “In response to the idea that it’s a good thing if people stop ordering so much random stuff, I say: ‘What’s the point of living in a country if I can’t order 100 pieces of junk for $15?’”Explore more on these topicsE-commerceDonald TrumpChinaSheinfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Julio Rimac Damian, from the nearby village of Challhuayaco, points to the mud under his feet. “All this used to be covered with water,” he says.A canal running from the lake that is supposed to carry water to lowland villages has also run dry. Damian says the water began to disappear two years ago when a mining company started exploratory drilling inPeru’s highlands.“This is a tragedy for us,” Damian says. “We depend on these waters.”View image in fullscreenJulio Rimac Damian, an environmental activist, says the mine puts Lake Contonga drying up down to the climate crisis.Photograph: Anna HeikkinenBehind Lake Contonga lies one of the biggest zinc mines in the world: Antamina. The open-pit mine, which also producescopper, silver, lead and molybdenum, is operated by a multinational corporation owned by the huge mining companiesBHP Billiton,GlencoreandTeck Resourcesas well as the Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi. Glencore, a key shareholder based in Switzerland, plays a dominant role in global mineral markets, while BHP is the world’s biggest miner.Antamina has been given the go-ahead by the Peruvian governmentto expand zinc extractionin the area, even though the Andean mountain rangesare classified asextremely vulnerable to the climate crisisby the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).More thanhalf of Peru’s glaciers have meltedover the past 50 years due to global heating. Meltwater from the glaciers is the main water source for the people of the Andes, but is already in short supply.Since 2014, Peru’s zinc production has increased and the value of exports hasrisen by nearly 60%, according to the ministry of energy and mines. The country has the world’sfourth-largest zinc reserves, traditionally exploited for the automotive and construction industries.View image in fullscreenThe dump at Antamina, an open-pit mine that produces copper, silver and lead as well as zinc.Photograph: AlamyHowever, the new zinc boom is fuelled by the surge in demand for green energy technology. Zinc is used to produce batteries, solar panels and windmills as it protects them from corrosion. Demand for it has recently soared, especially in the wind energy sector.According to the International Energy Agency, the green transition isdriving “unprecedented growth”in the minerals market. Although zinc is not yet at the top of the market, it is expected to see one of the biggest rises among green minerals. In 2022, the market price of zinc hit historic highs –$4,500 a tonne (£3,650).The future of the zinc industry in the green transition looks bright … we expect a significant increase in demandSabina Grund, IZAThe World Bank considers zinc to be one of themost important minerals for climate actionand predicts demand will increase by 200% by 2050.Sabina Grund, at the International Zinc Association (IZA), says: “The future of the zinc industry in the green transition looks very bright. In Europe, we expect a significant increase in zinc demand.”Peru is the world’s second-largest producer of unrefined zinc after China. In 2023,most of Peru’s zinc was exportedto China, the US, South Korea and Spain.View image in fullscreenProcessed zinc at Finland’s Boliden Kokkola smelter. Europe is a major destination for Peru’s zinc.Photograph: Adunais PérezIn 2023, the Antamina mine, partly owned by Glencore, produced almost 36% of Peru’s zinc, according toPeruvian customs records. Much of Europe’s zinc is refined at three large smelters: the Glencore-owned Asturiana de Zinc smelter in northern Spain, Nyrstar in Belgium and the Swedish-owned Boliden Kokkola in Finland.Peruvian zincimported to Europe to produce low-carbon technology is mined in areas already vulnerable to the climate crisis. In October 2023, the Peruvian congress declareda state of emergency due to droughtlinked to theEl Niñoweather fluctuation. The situation was particularly bad in the Andes, where zinc mining is concentrated.Studies show that mining can exacerbate the climate crisis in glacial areas, as dust pollution canaccelerate the melting of glaciersby absorbing more heat. In Chile, mining-waste ponds and road construction haveexacerbated the shrinking of glaciers.View image in fullscreenThe irrigation canal connected to Lake Contonga, which has dried out. A state of emergency was declared across much of Peru after a devastating drought in 2023.Photograph: Anna HeikkinenThe industry also uses large amounts of water and experts say mining poses thegreatest risk in areas with the least water, including Peru.“In the case of Antamina, the concession has been established in such a risk zone, as it is surrounded by key water reserves,” says Karem Luque, a Peruvian biologist specialising in human and environmental health.We are talking about chronic exposure of local people to different contaminants and toxic substances through air, soil and waterKarem Luque, biologist“Water supplies are heavily affected already in the exploration stage. Drilling holes of 100-150 metres in the ground interrupts the natural courses of water that feed principal rivers.”The zinc-mining industry could reduce its environmental impact by increasing recycling, say experts. Only29% of the world’s zinc is recycled,due to inadequate recovery systems because of a lack of economic incentives.Mining has caused other kinds of environmental damage and pollution elsewhere in Peru. “We are talking about chronic exposure of local people to different kinds of contaminants and toxic substances through air, soil and water,” Luque says.Evidence of contamination can also be found at the Antamina zinc mine. Between 2008 and 2023, the company was sanctioned over67 environmental incidents.These included exceeding permitted limits for pollution and failing to prevent leaks from wastewater ponds.View image in fullscreenLa Rinconada glacier, which is receding due to global heating, with hoses taking water to local people.

Even though it is the district surrounding Antamina, the source of the heavy metals is defined as “unknown”. In January 2024, a health and environmental emergency was declared across the region and several other districts.Residents say that last year the health authorities measured concentrations of heavy metal in water sources near the mine. The results have not yet been published.Arsenic is a highly toxic heavy metal released into the environment as a by-product of zinc extraction;exposure to high levels in water can cause cancerand other diseases.Antamina has also been questioned bythe Áncash regional health authoritiesabout allegations made bythe environmental organisation Natura and residents of Huarmeyabout the high levels of arsenic among people living in the port, where the company stores zinc before export. The company says the presence of heavy metals “is not related to their operative processes”.View image in fullscreenCarlos Flores, 76, sobs by photos of his sons, who died of cancer with high arsenic levels in their bodies, at home in Huarmey, from where zinc is exported.Photograph: E Benavides/AFP/GettyThe Guardian has seen the results ofurine analyses of 100 residentsliving near the port carried out in 2023; only two of them were within permitted levels. Several samples taken from children had arsenic levels at 10 to 15 times above the permitted limits.The exact sources of contamination are “not known”. In September 2024, the Áncash regional governmentput forward a planto find the sources of high levels of heavy metals, especially arsenic.Luque says transporting zinc to the port and storage facilities are probable sources of arsenic, as pollution builds up in the air and soil. Antamina’s representative says these results “alone are not sufficient to identify the nature of exposure or the source” of arsenic, adding that their copper and zinc concentrates arrive at Huarmey port “through a hermetic underground pipeline and its conditions are monitored in real time”.Peru’sEnvironmental Assessment and Oversight Agency (OEFA)did not respond to requests for comment about how it monitors heavy metal levels in the Huarmey port area.View image in fullscreenAntamina and the mine spoil from across the tailings dam.

They also do not pressure companies to make changes downstream in the production chain.”Stewart says the directive needs significant advancements to genuinely improve transparency and environmental practices in supply chains. Currently, responsible zinc production falls under a voluntary scheme run by the London Metal Exchange (LME) and the Zinc Mark, issued by the IZA.We wish the company would at least give us some economic support … the company never shows up hereElva Cotrina EspinozaBeing listed as an LME brand requires companies to follow a responsible sourcing policy, which includes implementing theOECD due diligence guidance.Nicole Hanson, head of sustainability at the exchange, says: “The LME’s ultimate action … is to suspend or de-list the brand from our approved brands list.”She adds: “We did have to take this action this year for many of our brands.”The European smelters Asturiana de Zinc and Boliden Kokkola, which imported Peruvian zinc in 2023, belong to theLME brand list. The list only covers smelters and refiners of zinc metal; companies extracting zinc ore or manufacturing finished zinc products are not subject to similar control.Nyrstar said it had “solid policies and due-diligence practices in place” as part of “actively pursuing” LME’s responsible sourcing practices and had been awarded the Zinc Mark for four of its six zinc smelters.Mitsubishi said Antamina met international and local standards, “considers coexistence with the local environment and communities as one of its top management priorities” and addressed issues in a timely manner.View image in fullscreenWhile one in four people in Áncash live in poverty, one of Antamina’s owners, Glencore, made $4.3bn profit for its shareholders in 2023.Photograph: Anna HeikkinenThe Guardian asked nine key European green technology manufacturers about the origin of the zinc they use in production. Only three companies replied, but they refused to comment on the origin of their zinc.Inthe Andean highlands, the morning sun is reflected in a green sign that stands out in the landscape. “Antamina mining area: no trespassing or animal grazing,” it reads. Julio Rimac Damian says he does not oppose mining but is disappointed by how the company treats local people and the environment.“The company just says to us that the lake is drying because of climate change,” he says.Andean alarm: climate crisis increases fears of glacial lake flood in PeruRead moreElva Cotrina Espinoza, a smallholder from Challhuayaco, shares the same view. “It is becoming increasingly difficult to earn a living from agriculture. Fertiliser prices are sky-high and there is hardly enough water,” she says.“We wish the company would at least give us some economic support. There is a desperate need for an irrigation canal, but the company never shows up here.”In the department of Áncash, where the Antamina mine is located, thepoverty rate reached 25% in 2023, a 16% rise on the year before, and nearly 68,000 people in the region live in extreme poverty. Many local residents are aware that Glencore made$4.3bn profit for its shareholdersthat year.“The mining profit does not end up with the communities,” says Damian. “Instead, the company wants to take out the last drops of our water.”This story was produced with assistance from Journalismfund EuropeExplore more on these topicsGlobal developmentSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanPeruMiningAmericasEl Niño southern oscillationPollutionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Powell, Pasadena unified schools interim food director, rushed to the district’s service center on Woodbury Road in Altadena to meet up with food service coworkers Melissa Washington and Marcela Zamorano.“But pretty soon the police showed up and told us we had to evacuate,” said Powell, whose home lost power and employees could hear transformers and propane tanks blowing before returning home and waiting out the blaze. “It was bad, very scary.”‘We won’t be able to return to our house’: the struggle to recover from LA wildfiresRead moreFood service crews around the Pasadena unified school district, which encompasses the fire-ravaged community of Altadena, evacuated or lost power. Some lost their homes. Still, by the next day, Powell and most of her staff regrouped, and were dispensing free lunches for students using “everything on hand” at school sites. Pasadena, likeLos Angelesunified school district, is a community eligibility provision district, which means all children eat for free.View image in fullscreenBy Wednesday, cars were arriving by drips and drabs, in stead of steady streams. Foodservice workers Sue Cisneros and Ino Cortez dispensed the meals.Photograph: Victoria Clayton-AlexanderPowell, who had seen the district through the Covid-19 pandemic, knows a crisis. She hopped online and submitted the required child nutrition program school emergency plan, which was quickly approved by the state. Then she called a food vendor she thought she could count on. Powell was right. Though schools were closed, her food service crew was up and running with enough ready-made meals to start grab and go drive-throughs at several sites around town. They also began dropping off breakfasts and lunches at the YMCA, Pasadena Parks & Rec and Pacific Community College – all places offering emergency childcare for evacuated and displaced students. At the high point, the effort totaled well over 2,000 students fed.“The pandemic was one thing,” Powell said. “But this time it feels more emotional. You have parents driving up saying: ‘I see you gave my child cereal and milk for breakfast. Do you happen to have a spoon? We have nothing left.’”‘Times are very tough right now’At James Madison elementary in Pasadena, just 10 minutes from Altadena, cars inch up to the tables on Ashtabula Street where food service workers Ino Cortez and Sue Cisneros pass bags through open windows to grateful parents. One bag for breakfast contains fruit, milk, and cereal or a baked good and another for lunch has a turkey, ham and cheese sandwich, fruit, celery sticks and milk. Small bags of kiwifruit were added, too.The non-profit Pasadena Education Foundation sent a brigade of volunteers to help and the team gave out more than 1,500 meals in one day. The principal of Madison Elementary, Dr Elisa Perez, had also arranged for the local food bank to deliver emergency boxes that contained enough food for a family of four for three days. In addition, there was produce give aways – carrots, potatoes, squash and lettuce – as well as water, toiletries and books – all donated from local organizations and individuals.Nearly two weeks after the fire broke out, Ino Cortez, the food service supervisor for Madison Elementary, says his drive-up customers have dwindled to about 500 meal requests, which is a good thing. It means many displaced families have gotten back into their homes and Pasadena unified schools have begun to reopen. Schools reopened on 30 January.View image in fullscreenLiz Powell says, “Whoever shows up, we’re prepared to feed them.”Photograph: Victoria Clayton-Alexander‘It brings out the best in humanity’: the rescuers saving pets from LA’s wildfiresRead moreCortez lost his own Altadena home, and has been hunkering down in an Airbnb in Alhambra with his wife, two adult children, nephew, nephew’s wife and their two children. They moved to another Airbnb in Altadena. “After that, we don’t know,” he says. His eldest son, who lives in a condo that wasn’t destroyed, housed them for several days and gave his dad some clothes to wear. Cortez was able to report to work the Monday after the fire. He says giving out food to children in need makes him feel a bit better. “Being here doing something takes my mind off of what we lost, but I do wake up in the middle of the night and wonder what we’re going to do,” he says. “We need a house.”Parent Sheyla Saenz has been a regular in Cortez’s grab & go line. Her three children attend Pasadena’s Longfellow elementary and Octavia Butler magnet middle school. She says having access to the meals has really helped her family. They didn’t lose their residence, but she had to cut her work hours because her children were home. “Any little thing helps,” she says. “Times are very tough right now.” Besides, she says, her children really like the food provided.Now, the question, says Powell, is if students will show up for class once facilities are reopened. “We hope they do,” says Powell. “But if their families can’t find housing locally, they may not be able to.”But, she adds: “Whoever shows up, we’re prepared to feed them.”Explore more on these topicsCalifornia wildfiresLos AngelesWildfiresUS wildfiresExtreme weatherCaliforniaFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

However, a presidential statement published last month said the “destructive” trade deficit, rather than fentanyl, was the primary driver of the tariffs.The China-Mexico fentanyl pipeline: increasingly sophisticated and deadlyRead moreTrump has described tariffs as a response to China’s failure to curb theflow of deadly synthetic opioids into the US.“I have had many talks with China about the massive amounts of drugs, in particular fentanyl, being sent into the United States – but to no avail,” Trump wrote when he raised the issue in November. “Representatives of China told me that they would institute their maximum penalty, that of death, for any drug dealers caught doing this but, unfortunately, they never followed through, and drugs are pouring into our country, mostly throughMexico, at levels never seen before. Until such time as they stop, we will be charging China an additional 10% tariff.”China has disputed this depiction of the issue. In November a foreign ministry spokesperson said: “China is one of the world’s toughest countries on counternarcotics both in terms of policy and its implementation.Fentanylis an issue for the US. In the spirit of humanity, China has given support to the US’s response to this issue.”What is fentanyl?Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is far more powerful than heroin. Although it has legitimate medical uses for pain management, it is also at the heart of theUS opioids crisis. Last year, nearly 75,000 people in the US died from a fentanyl overdose. The White House describes fentanyl as “a scourge that has no geographic or political boundaries” while Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution,has saidthat the crisis is the “most lethal drug epidemic ever in human history”.How much of it comes from China?Fentanyl started arriving in the US from China about 10 years ago. In 2020, the US Drug Enforcement Administration said that China was the “primary source of fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances trafficked through international mail”. As authorities in the US and China have cracked down on traffickers and criminal gangs, much of that flow has beenrerouted through cartels in Mexico. Rather than sending shipments of finished illicit fentanyl directly to the US, drug traffickers and exporters in China send precursor chemicals to Mexico, where they can be turned into fentanyl andsent on to the US.What has China done to curb the flow of fentanyl into the US?The 2010s were a bright spot for US-China cooperation on fentanyl. In 2019, at the behest of the US,China scheduled all forms of fentanyl,the only major country to permanently include the drugs on a list of controlled substances. In the US, fentanyl analogues are only temporarily controlled, with the classification set to expire in December 2024.But in 2022, when the thenspeaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, Beijing responded angrily by cutting off several channels of communication with the US, including counternarcotics co-operation.It was only last year, whenJoe Biden and Xi Jinping met in San Francisco, that bilateral talks on fentanyl were reopened. In the past few months, China has been scheduling fentanyl precursors that have been banned internationally, catching up with moves to block the flow of the chemicals that are used to make fentanyl as well as blocking the flow of the drug itself. This would, in theory, make it easier to crack down on drugs traffickers.China and the US have also agreed to cooperate on tackling money laundering. Chinese and Mexican organised criminal gangs form the financial backbone of the international fentanyl trade.But China insists that the fentanyl crisis is, at its heart, a problem of the US’s own making. “The root cause of the overdose lies in the US itself, which calls for more effective measures from the US government,” China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, said last month.Explore more on these topicsFentanylChinaMexicoDrugs tradeDonald TrumpUS foreign policyAsia PacificexplainersShareReuse this content"

The island has never had electricity, and there are no tarred roads, only footpaths.For power, its residents, mostly fishers or cassava, rice and corn farmers, rely on generators running on fuel that has become costly since a subsidy was scrappedtwo years ago. Water, which comes from the Lekki Lagoon – a site for open defecation as there are no proper toilet facilities – and wells, is poured on to improvised filters consisting of old cloths spread on basins.The island has never had a hospital, and its only healthcare centre closed several years ago. In the only school, which serves children of nursery and primary school age, some classrooms were shut a few years ago after their roofs started caving in. For further education, pupils have to take a boat ride to a nearby island.Every time Yinka Banjo, a leader of one of the communities on the island, leaves the island, he carries his power bank and device chargers steadfastly, like passports to civilisation.“There is nothing here, we are as you see now,” he said.View image in fullscreenThe closed healthcare centre on Refuge Island, where people lack basic facilities such as electricity and running water.Photograph: Eromo Egbejule/The GuardianFor years, supporters of Nigeria’s ruling All Progressives Congress have held up Lagos as a testament to the vision of the party’s leader, the country’s president, Bola Tinubu. The megacity – comprising a mainland core connected to multiple islands by several lagoons beside the Atlantic – and state of the same name would be among Africa’s 10 largest economies if it were a standalone country. Tinubu, a two-term Lagos governor, influenced the selection of his successors to “guide the state to prosperity”, as his supporters say.Running east to west below Refuge Island is the Lekki peninsula, which has since the 1990s undergone rapid development that has made it one of Nigeria’s most prosperous neighbourhoods, home to upmarket malls, a recently launched deepwater seaport, and the world’s largest single-train oil refinery.A map of Lagos and the Gulf of GuineaBeyond the refinery and port, two forgotten islands lie hidden in plain sight in the lagoon: uninhabited Ita-Oko, which used to host a prison and then a drug rehabilitation centre, and Refuge Island.Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour, an architect and opposition politician, said the island, with its white sands and swaying coconut and palm trees, has the potential to become a tourist haven where “artists live in communes that sell locally-made artefacts”.View image in fullscreenLekki peninsula, close to Refuge Island, has undergone rapid development, and now has a deepwater seaport.Photograph: Xinhua/AlamyFor now, its residents wait endlessly for the government to even acknowledge their existence.One resident who did not want to be named said a former state governor had arranged for a borehole to be dug and a solar power system installed about 20 years ago. The borehole collapsed after three years. “We appreciated it,” the resident said. “But since then, [silence].”There are many riverine communities around Lagos that have been left behind by the boom times and often lack basic amenities. Some house the descendants of people who migrated from the Benin Republic a century or more ago.Rhodes-Vivour said poor communities were being excluded by development in the state. “The vision is to look like Dubai,” he said. “But you have a 70% poverty rate. Most of people cannot afford to live in Dubai-like conditions … development needs to be a lot more even.”Taibat Lawanson, a professor of urban planning at the universities of Liverpool and Lagos, said some communities were being excluded from development projects because of questions about their ancestry. “Often there is a narrative that residents are not Nigerians and that they are there illegally, essentially looking away from the fact that everybody who is born in Nigeria is a Nigerian national no matter the nationality of their parents,” she said.One elder on Refuge Island said no major government project had been initiated since the 1980s.Residents say senior politicians have never visited the island, even for political campaigns. Nevertheless, the ruling party and its previous iteration has come first in voting on the island in every national election since the return to democracy in 1999. Rhodes-Vivour claims this comes down to the practice of politicians sending some food or money to inhabitants on the eve of election day. The APC was approached for comment.In recent years the plight of places such as Refuge Island has become more well-known as middle class Lagosians have sought out tranquil environments where they can escape from the city. In some instances the city dwellers have initiated small-scale interventions alongside resort owners to tidy up communities.Experts like Lawanson say these interventions and government’s “benevolence approach to development, especially when it comes to vulnerable groups” need to end and the focus needs to shift to schemes that tackle systemic inequality.But even short-term relief is acceptable for the locals on Refuge Island, who say they are tired of waiting for a miracle. “We did our bit for the government,” said Banjo, referring to support for the APC in elections. “Only God knows when we’ll get our dues.”Explore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

What do the big hair, vulgar slogans and expensive logos promise for the future?Jess Cartner-MorleyTue 4 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTShareThe age ofDonald Trumpis an assault on the senses. There is a brutish grandeur to a president who, in his heavy, shoulder-padded Brioni suits, looks like a buffalo painted by Holbein. Geopolitics has been warped into a Lord of the Flies fever dream, presided over by a bronze face-painted playground bully. Bedazzled cowboy hats and Maga caps, YMCA and raised fists, speak of a culture with the volume dial turned up. Just as power has been cut free from responsibility, so has prestige been unchained from taste. Trump 2.0 feels like a Space Mountain ride with no safety bar – and it is just getting started.Fashion speaks loudly in this new world. Two weeks into the second Trump term, power dressing already has a new look. Out with the careful patrician decorum of the Bidens, in with a novel era of American bling. The cultured metropolitan allure of the Obamas is a distant memory, overlaid with bright lights, big hair, vulgar slogans and expensive logos. Elon Musk’s preposterous flight jacket. Melania Trump’s strange hat. Lauren Sánchez’s inauguration-day lingerie. It is, as the kids say, a lot.It is very easy to trash-talk the Trump look. Easy, but simplistic – and also dangerous. Simplistic, because his image has an undeniable blockbuster appeal. A lot of people – 77,284,118 voters, to be precise – like what they see. Dangerous, because to sneer and sniff at an aesthetic that rips up the establishment rulebook plays directly into Trump’s hands.View image in fullscreenDefying every feminine dress code … Lauren Sánchez with her fiance Jeff Bezos (right) and Mark Zuckerberg on inauguration day.Photograph: Kenny Holston/ReutersThe Trump look has had a glow-up for its second term. In contrast to the cheerless tone set by a carnage-themed inauguration speech eight years ago, Trump 2.0 arrived in Washington DC setting a newly merry tone. There were more smiles, more celebrities, more beautiful people on board. The messaging was simple, but effective. Big parties with hamburgers and fireworks are fun. Having lots of money is fun. Winning is fun. A century of Hollywood history proves that audiences love men with big muscles and women with bouncy blond hair. At a party packed with wealthy young Trump supporters in Butterworth’s restaurant in Washington on the weekend of the swearing in, a 28-year-old conservative influencer, Xaviaer DuRousseau, toldNew Yorkmagazine: “It’s Republican Coachella and Donald Trump is our Beyoncé.”The first rule of storytelling is to show, not tell, and that is precisely how Trump and his circle get dressed. In Trump’s world, men are men and women are women. Even before he signed an executive order proclaiming that the US government will recognise only two sexes, male and female, the optics of his entourage were making this point.View image in fullscreenThe most fluent fashion speaker of the tribe … Ivanka Trump wearing mismatched earrings.Photograph: ReutersTrump’s suits are square and oversized, no dandyish touches of silk pocket squares or discreetly nipped waists, certainly no modish short trouser hems. The broligarchy of Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg are gym-pumped and wear just-jumped-off-the-helicopter aviator shades. The Fox News contributor Kellyanne Conway and Megyn Kelly, the conservative podcaster who described Trump’s return to the White House as “an instant utopia”, are the frontwomen for a vision of femininity rooted in the California blondes of Sweet Valley High teen fiction.There has also been increased demand for the Republican blowout: scaled up to TV studio proportions, it is bigger and bouncier than the understated sleek bobs of the Democratic era. This is a world in which women never get wrinkles, never go grey and fit into their wedding dresses for ever. One glance at his entourage shows that Trump’s anti-woke policy waits for no legislation: it is already strictly enforced.Zuckerberg calls it “masculine energy”, but we can keep calling it the patriarchy. The women in Trump’s camp have two dominant looks. There is very demure, ultra-ladylike tailoring with an emphasis on the waist for the daytime and bare-shouldered ballgowns for evening. The duality comes with an unspoken pressure to prioritise getting home to get changed and put hot rollers in your hair over anything else on your to-do list. Both looks have a mid-century, retro flavour.For the inauguration, Ivanka Trump, the most fluent fashion speaker of the tribe, wore a forest-green skirt suit inspired by a 1950 Dior collection, followed by an evening gown modelled on one made by Hubert de Givenchy for Audrey Hepburn in the 1954 film Sabrina. She even carbon-dated the look with full-length opera gloves. Usha Vance, who after the inauguration ceremony swapped a very covered coquette-pink coat for a strapless dress, followed suit.The rise of the tradwife aesthetic– a gen Z social media trend for young women to play idealised housewives, cooking elaborate meals for broods of adorable children without ever chipping a nail, getting jam on a white poplin prairie dress or letting a smile drop – suggests this retrograde cosplay may have cross-generational appeal.Dressing in the age of Trump is also about money. Here, the golden rule is simple: whoever has the gold makes the rules. The billionaires are in charge, so if you want your voice to be heard, you need tolookrich. Zuckerberg has taken to wearing a $900,000 (£730,000) Greubel Forsey watch. Melania has never made any attempt to tone down her expensive tastes, which include a preference for Christian Louboutin stilettos and a substantial collection of Hermès Birkin bags, which sell for between $30,000 and $90,000.View image in fullscreenA self-made man? Donald Trump in a hi-vis vest on the campaign trail last year.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesSuch is the power of money that when money goes head to head with ideas about gender, money wins. Sánchez defied every feminine dress code at the inauguration by wearing a lace bra exposed under her Alexander McQueen jacket. The vibe seemed to be: when your fiance is Bezos, you do what you like. No shade on Sánchez, who is entitled to wear what she chooses. But it is interesting to observe the power of money to abruptly shunt the Overton window of what is and isn’t acceptable at a state occasion.Elite dressing has always been about looking rich, but this is a different kind of rich. In Trump’s court, money does not whisper in the cashmere soft tones ofquiet luxury– it shouts. Old money talks in code, in classy under-the-radar brands such as the Italian houses of Loro Piana and Brunello Cucinelli. In an establishment where power is handed down through generations, it is helpful to look as if you have grown up rich. But Trump’s origin story of being a self-made man – fake news, but whatever – is cannily reflected in the clumsiness of his look: too-wide ties, too-dark tan. It is an outsider’s idea of how rich men dress. To reinforce this message, he has been known to swap the suit for a rubbish collector’shi-vis vest, or aMcDonald’s apron, both of which he wore on the campaign trail last year.The one person in Trump’s orbit who does not jump to his beat is the first lady, who has confounded expectations with her reluctance to play the trophy wife. Her new official portrait, which shows her in a trouser suit – a bold move in itself – has strong LinkedIn energy, with an enigmatic Melania in power pose behind a mirror-polished desk. (Jill Biden wore a pink dress and smiled in the Rose Garden in hers.) Melania makes no pretence of playing nice. From the “I Really Don’t Care, Do U?” jacket to the hat that concealed her face at the inauguration, her clothes are dismissive of, if not openly hostile to, other people.View image in fullscreenConfounding expectations … the official portrait of first lady Melania Trump in 2025.Photograph: Régine Mahaux/The White HouseBut what could be more Trumpian than a first lady who tramples all over the accepted wardrobe rules of Washington? Like her husband, Melania sees her position not as one of service, but in terms of what it can do for her. Yet, perhaps accidentally, Melania’s blatant disregard for the rules fulfils one of the unofficial functions of first lady, which is to humanise the president. Who can forget the image of Trump gamely attempting to greet his wife in the Capitol and being thwarted by the brim of a hat that made it impossible for him to land a kiss. A hat can assert boundaries as effectively as any fence. Trump never seems more vulnerable than in the presence of Melania.Ivanka is unique in her ability to shapeshift between Trump’s world and that of the liberal elite. She can do GOP Barbie, but she can also fit in at Frieze art fair. In 2017, she effectively trolled the fashion community by wearing amismatched pair of earrings, as though she was trying to say she was just like them. It has been reported that the symbolism of her Dior inauguration suit, nodding to Paris’s postwar New Look, a moment in which a country on the verge of change reached for a nostalgic vision of femininity, was not lost on Ivanka. Her fashion agenda is not to be underestimated.There is one more style reference to mention here. Trump claims that divine intervention saved him from assassination in Pennsylvania in July. He believes he has been anointed a king by God. His first lady, meanwhile, has made hats a signature look, which is hard to miss as an allusion to royalty, in particular to the long reign of Queen Elizabeth II. The Trumps, who would like this second term to lay the groundwork for a new American dynasty, with their children following them into the Oval Office, are moving toward framing themselves as a royal family. Ivanka’s costuming of her family on inauguration day, with her monocolour outfit echoed in the camel outfit of her daughter, had unmistakable overtones of the Cambridges, with 13-year-oldArabella Kushner’s caped coatreminiscent of thecape and dressworn by Princess Charlotte at King Charles III’s coronation. Fashion speaks loud and clear in the court of Trump. None of us can afford not to be listening.Explore more on these topicsFashionDonald TrumpMelania TrumpRepublicansUS politicsIvanka TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Overwhelmed by his presence in the house, I found my perspective on our relationship starting to shiftMarianne BrownTue 4 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTShareIwanted to reach out and feel the weight of the speckled eggs in my palm. Guillemot eggs: longer than a chicken’s and slightly pear-like in form, so that when they roll, they do so in a tight arc, rather than towards the cliff edge. There are plenty of cliffs to roll off in Shetland, a group of wind-scalped islands where the North Atlantic and the North Sea crash together, as well as other wild delights, like the precious mosses and orchids threading through the craggy peat bogs. Just over the hill, a low orange glow served as a reminder of a very different island treasure: Sullom Voe, one of the largest oil and gas terminals in Europe.I stood by the trestle table staring at the strangely static greenish-blue eggs. A closer look revealed they were not what they seemed; in fact, they were not eggs at all. They were ceramic plates so cleverly designed that the slightly concave base appeared to curve outwards. It took a moment to re-adjust my focus.The plates were among a small exhibition celebrating the life of my father, the acclaimed potter and proud Shetlander Bill Brown. It was February 2020 and he had died a few weeks before. From cake stands designed like Tunnock’s teacake wrappers to a butter dish decorated with the words “I can’t believe it’s not plastic”, each piece brought a bit of his talent and humour into the village hall. While the wind and ice-edged rain slapped the hills around us, safely inside we listened to his favourite fiddle music, shared funny stories and looked at photographs of the man we all knew in different ways. I learned a lot about Dad that day as artists, neighbours, childhood friends and family members mourned his loss.Shetland was ingrained in Dad’s being, from his dialect to his fiddle-playing and taste for salty foodsI had travelled from Devon with my partner, Josh, and four-year-old daughter, Esme, to attend the funeral. It was a journey I hadn’t made often; Dad had only returned to the isles of his birth a few years before, following his retirement as head of ceramic design at the Glasgow School of Art. Our physical distance matched an emotional one. My parents split when I was very young and my dad and I were never close. I was raised by my mother in Edinburgh and saw Dad only on weekends and some school holidays. I didn’t remember him attending birthdays or many special occasions. Later, I moved abroad and saw him just once a year. There was affection and a distant sense of pride, but no strong sense of attachment.Shetland was ingrained in Dad’s being, from his dialect woven with Scots and Norwegian influences to his fiddle-playing and taste for salty foods.View image in fullscreenEsme on the beach in the 2020 lockdown.Photograph: Marianne BrownAfter retiring, he built a house and a pottery on the land once worked by his forebears. He reforested the slopes of the croft with native trees – hazel and blackthorn – and hacked a tattie patch out of the dull green hillside.But to me Shetland had remained a distant place of school holidays and quick trips to catch up with relatives. I didn’t know that, as I stood squinting at the egg plates in the village hall, a novel coronavirus was spreading across the world, which would change the way I viewed the isles for ever.It was the day after the funeral that Josh and I began to realise how serious the situation was. Italy had just imposed a lockdown and people in Britain were starting to die. We had packed enough in our suitcases to last just a few weeks. Could we risk taking our daughter back to Devon: 14 hours on the ferry and 10 more on the train? We decided just in time.“Let me be blunt,” Scotland’s first minister,Nicola Sturgeon, saidon the radio. “The stringent restrictions on our normal day‑to‑day lives that I’m about to set out are difficult and they are unprecedented. They amount effectively to what has been described as a lockdown.”We would face Britain’s first lockdown in Kirkhouse, the home Dad had built overlooking the ruins of his grandparents’ croft, across the road from his childhood house, which his father had built. At mealtimes, we would look out at the inlet and see the graveyard where his body lay. We would cook in his kitchen, sleep in his bedroom, wash in his shower, water his houseplants and never get around to tiling his bathroom.It took a while for the reality of our situation to settle in. All around me were Dad’s things: books, ornaments, bills and receipts stretching back decades. Even the cup in my hands, spun on a wheel maybe 30 years before, had the imprint of his fingertips on the base. As I turned my head to view the four walls around me, I found myself asking: where, among all this Dad, am I?View image in fullscreenEsme by the sea, 2020.Photograph: Marianne BrownJosh and I alternated work and childcare, each taking a stint at the desk in Dad’s study or, on the days the weather did not hold us captive indoors, coaxing Esme outside to play in the fields and along the shoreline. Some days, we played in the ruins of the two-roomed house where my great-grandparents had raised their many children. Now, it was a rectangle of loose stones and a weather-worn lintel, a shelter from the scything wind, within which Dad had grown kale, rhubarb and strawberries.It seemed to me a mirror of his craft, as if he were paying homage to his ancestors, generations of crofters, by remembering their way of life. It was another reminder of his presence: his body and spirit mingled with the soil that nourished the plants at our feet.In the moments I felt overwhelmed by Dad’s presence and absence, it was people’s acts of kindness that kept me groundedSometimes Esme was on a mission to find the “bones of her ancestors” in the soil while I fretted about her proximity to the shoogly wall. Mostly, she was content with the shards of pottery she unearthed. The blue and white patterns fitted together, but there weren’t enough pieces to guess what it had once been: a plate, a saucer, the rim of a large bowl. Too old to be “Granpa Bill’s”, these went further back in time. Esme placed them with other items of interest – plastic beads, dried seaweed, a fragment of blue eggshell – in a set of tiny drawers gifted by a relative.The drawers were among many acts of kindness that sustained us during the months of lockdown. As our days of isolation extended, neighbours and relatives dropped off books, games and toys to keep our daughter entertained, mindful of the fact we had arrived with just two rucksacks between us. In the moments I felt overwhelmed by Dad’s presence and absence in the house, it was these small acts of kindness that kept me grounded. Despite our isolation, we had become part of an invisible network holding everyone together.While I had believed in a story of rejection, I was learning that Dad had kept parts of me close to himWe unearthed treasures inside the house, too. I found an old cushion cover I had made in primary school and a tape recording of me playing the piano. It was a surprise to find them here among Dad’s things, traces of myself that I had forgotten but he had kept tight. A clay dragon, about a foot long, sat among papers and books on a shelf in his study. Every time I took a seat on the swivel chair at the desk, I would cast it a glance and it would look straight back at me, a moment of quiet puzzlement. I was sure we knew each other, but I couldn’t remember where we had met before. It wasn’t until a few months had passed, and we were beginning to feel like Kirkhouse was our home, that I remembered: long ago, in the ceramics department where Dad worked, I had stood at a stained workbench rolling shapes out of clay – a tail and thumb-printed scales. I had made this dragon and here, next to his desk, Dad had kept it.The toys for Esme, the carefully tended plants in the ruined croft house and my childhood offerings to Dad now all appeared twisted together, forming a tapestry of care, past and present. In it, he and I were woven together.Throughout my life, I had only heard one side of the story and seen Dad as a distant figure. But while I had believed in a story of rejection, I was learning that he had kept parts of me close to him.View image in fullscreenBill Brown with Esme in Shetland, summer 2019.Photograph: Marianne BrownThe house had two rhythms: one set by the unpredictable energy of a small child; the other by her resting state. It was during the latter that I would find myself, suddenly caught in the stillness, gazing at the spines of the books on Dad’s shelves: encyclopedias; dictionaries; books on economics, language, natural history, ancient history, Scottish history; and one that I had given him on the history of the AK-47. I would open them, imagining Dad’s hands on the covers, his large, rough fingers teasing apart the thin pages. I felt as if I was inside his mind, pulling out his thoughts and interests, trying to understand.I flicked through one book on Shetland and Orkney folklore, wondering if there would be anything to share with Esme. Inside were pony-shaped monsters, ghosts and trows, Shetland descendants of the Norse troll. The printed words also conjured a scene from my own past: Dad sitting at my bedside during one of my weekend visits, haltingly translating a book of Norwegian folk tales. Every now and then, he would pause for a few moments over a tricky sentence or two while I waited, tense and impatient, to find out what would happen next.Standing in his living room decades later, the folklore book in my hand, more memories came back to me: the family sharing trow stories as we picked our way between the hills on a twilight walk – tales of creatures that shrank in size to fit the moulds and cairns of the low islands of Shetland.The Shetland Way by Marianne Brown review – a daughter’s journey to the heart of the climate crisisRead moreBeing held captive among Dad’s belongings had nurtured in me a new closeness with him and, for the first time, I was able to bring the stories of my childhood to life with Esme. Her favourite, a trow called Rose, became a mentor to her in this new world of peat bogs, tides and cliffs. In our stories, Rose would call on Esme to help her solve the mystery of a poisoned stream, or help defeat an evil oil spill that was spreading towards an eider duck colony. “We must save them!” we cried as we bounced down the steep slope outside the house. Rose became a tool through which to introduce an awareness of the looming catastrophes that could define Esme’s life – climate breakdown, species extinction – without causing her to feel overwhelmed. She was our bridge between imagination and reality, a way to navigate this new territory while rooted in a sense of belonging.We looked out at the view: the ruined crofts, the singular cries of once plentiful birds, the simmering of the grey sea in the bay. Esme reached for my hand and I felt the soft cushion of her palm against my skin, delicate as a guillemot egg. I remembered, long before, the feeling of clutching a large calloused finger in mine.The Shetland Way by Marianne Brown is published by Borough Press (£16.99).

Photograph: Daniel Damaschin/AlamyMeteorite falls are extremely rare and offer a glimpse of the processes that formed our world billions of years ago. When a space rock came to an English market town in 2021, scientists raced to find as much out as they couldByHelen GordonTue 4 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2025 11.41 ESTShareAt 21.54 on 28 February 2021, 16 cameras belonging to amateur sky-watching network UKMON picked up a bright shape headed towards Earth. Pictures show a long white line, which was visible for eight seconds, a glowing globule of light against the dark sky. “For me it’s like fishing,” said Richard Kacerek, one of the founders of UKMON. “You cast your line and then you wait. There are days when you catch nothing but there are days when you catch a really, really big fish and it’s so exciting.” The fireball of February 2021 was such a fish: a lump of flaming extraterrestrial rock travelling at a speed of about 8.4 miles a second – 15 times the speed of a rifle bullet – and headed for the Cotswolds market town of Winchcombe.Meteorites are rocks from space that have entered our atmosphere. Most were once part of asteroids – the rocky, airless remnants left over from the formation of our solar system 4.6bn years ago. Almost all of them are what collectors call “finds”, meaning that the stone has been discovered by searching the ground, having fallen earlier – in most cases several thousand years earlier. A “fall”, a meteorite that is seen in flight and then recovered, is very, very rare. Worldwide, typically only about 10 such rocks are picked up each year. Before 2021, the last reported UK fall was a rock the size of a cricket ball that landed in a hedge in Glatton in Cambridgeshire in May 1991.With its woods, heaths, moors and arable farm land, and with so many other terrestrial rocks and pebbles to confuse things, most of the UK is terrible meteorite-hunting territory. Even so, with enough flight data you can attempt to calculate a meteorite’s trajectory, to try to figure out where it has landed.On 1 March, the morning after the fireball, Ashley King, a planetary scientist at the Natural History Museum (NHM) and lead of the UK Fireball Alliance (UKFall), began scanning the data from the camera networks. UKFall brings together the different hobbyist camera networks and the professional scientists who want to find and study the meteorites. The scientists studied a map of the Cotswolds and drew an oval shape covering a 280km2area where parts of a meteorite might have landed. Now the race was on to try to recover the rocks.As soon as a meteorite enters the Earth’s atmosphere it begins to change, thanks to the effects of oxygen, wind, rain or any other contaminating material. This is why recently fallen meteorites are especially prized. Meteorite collectors term them “fresh”. The weather in the Cotswolds on 28 February and 1 March was clear and dry but it was imperative to reach the meteorite – if it had survived the journey – as soon as possible.Because the UK was in lockdown, the teams from the NHM, the University of Glasgow and other institutions couldn’t immediately travel to Winchcombe. Usually they would try to keep a search area to themselves for three or four days but now, as King and his colleagues anxiously scanned the weather forecasts, they took the decision to ask the public for help. Once the meteor speed slows to below 3km a second it stops shining and enters what is called “dark flight”, when it is no longer observable. To work out where it landed you have to make various assumptions about what the rock is made of, what shape it is and what the wind will have done to it.View image in fullscreenA fragment from the Winchcombe meteorite.Photograph: Trustees of the Natural History Museum/PAThe map of where it could have fallen was released. King spent the day talking to journalists and making announcements on the radio. To minimise contamination, King issued the following instructions to the public: “If you find something that might be a meteorite take a photograph of it in situ; record the location; only handle it wearing gloves; put it into a sealable plastic bag or some aluminium foil. Email us!”The less the meteorite was altered by its stay on Earth, the greater the scientific value would be. Meteorites – because of their great age and because, compared with Earth rocks, they are relatively pristine – provide a window back in time through which we might glimpse the processes that formed and shaped the solar system, the moons, the planets and our own world. Most rocks on Earth have been subjected to plate tectonics – the constant destruction and recycling of our Earth’s crust – and to weathering on the surface. Any information about the very early Earth has been destroyed. If we want to read those earliest pages of Earth’s history, meteorites from asteroids are the oldest objects available for study. Without them we cannot begin to answer the questions: where did we come from? How did we begin?With a population of 5,000, Winchcombe is a pretty town of honeycomb-coloured limestone and timber-framed buildings. The Wilcock family home is a neat 1960s detached house on a quiet cul-de-sac on the outskirts of town. Early in the morning of 1 March, Cathryn Wilcock, a retired primary school teacher, opened the curtains of her living room and noticed a pile of dark lumps and powder at the edge of her driveway. It looked as though someone had upended an old barbecue.The Winchcombe meteorite had probably travelled more than 100m miles to reach our planet. Had it landed just a few metres to the left it would have fallen into a thick privet hedge and probably never been discovered. Had it landed a few metres closer to the road, Cathryn would have assumed it was rubbish churned up by a passing car and swept it away. Instead, her husband, Rob, went out to investigate.Rob immediately recognised that something strange had occurred. He got together some rubber gloves, old yoghurt pots and plastic bags and went outside to pick up the stones.The NHM and other institutions that deal with meteorites are used to fielding inquiries from people who think they’ve found a space rock. Among the scientific meteorite community, such rocks have their own name: meteorwrongs. Randy L Korotev, a scientist at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri, has a webpage devoted to them. “I have examined thousands of photos that people have sent to me over the past 20-plus years. Probably for less than 1 in 1,000 photos have I thought: ‘Yes, that might be a meteorite,’” he has written, with some exasperation. Slag is a particular issue. A glassy byproduct of smelting ores to retrieve metal, it looks nothing like the local rocks around it. It looks a bit like what your idea of a meteorite might be: dark and gnarly, something forged with fire. As a meteorite enters the Earth’s atmosphere, slowing down, it begins to rapidly cool, and its molten surface forms a dark, glassy coating called a fusion crust. Unlike a meteorite, slag has large vesicles – holes caused by gas bubbles when the rock was originally cooling – and no fusion crust.Another challenge is that when people see a fire in the sky, they tend to assume that it’s very close to them. In reality, because the meteorite is high in the sky and therefore visible across vast swathes of land, it may be very far away. With the Winchcombe meteorite, King had photographs of rocks sent in from places as distant as Scotland. The NHM scientists were swamped with replies. So when, around 4pm on the Monday, King viewed an email with a photograph of someone’s driveway, he was initially suspicious. The photograph showed some dark black lumps surrounded by dark black powder. It was the sort of splat shape you might expect if something fell to the ground from a great height.“I have to admit that I wasn’t absolutely convinced at first,” King said. “That splat shape … it was a little bit too perfect. You do get people who will fake things. It’s a weird thing to do but it happens,” he said. What were the chances of the meteorite landing so neatly and conveniently in front of someone’s house? (According to the Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb: “Statistically, you have to wait for a billion years before your home will be hit by a meteorite.”)But fake or not, King wanted to get his hands on the potential meteorites as quickly as possible. In addition to the weather, there was another reason to hurry. With news of the meteorite all over the internet, professional meteorite hunters would be alerted to the scene. Here, the Covid lockdown was in some ways a piece of good fortune. “Otherwise we could have been overrun with big meteorite hunters from abroad,” King told me. These are the sorts of people who can jump on a plane at a moment’s notice to get to the site of a suspected fall.View image in fullscreenHannah, Rob and Cathyrn Wilcock at the Natural History Museum.Photograph: Chris Jackson/Getty ImagesOn 2 March, Richard Greenwood, a scientist at the Open University, sat down at his desk to see what King had sent him. Rob Wilcock’s picture was the first image he opened. “To be honest it was like one of those moments when your legs start going wobbly because I saw this thing … and I just thought – that is a meteorite,” he told the BBC. “It was instantaneous.”By 3 March, King was negotiating with the NHM and the government to get permission to travel to the Cotswolds. Greenwood, who lives near Winchcombe, set off as soon as he could. When he arrived at the Wilcocks’ house, Rob came out holding a plastic bag. “It was the second wobbly moment of the day. I looked inside and I could not believe it,” Greenwood said. Not only was there a meteorite in the bag, it looked to be a very, very unusual one: a carbonaceous chondrite. Comprising only about 4% of all meteorite falls, these are among the most primitive and pristine of space rocks. They are also rich in water and organic material. Some scientists believe that carbonaceous chondrites were responsible for delivering the first water to our planet. Without meteorites, so the theory goes, there would be no rivers or oceans, lakes or streams. Some also believe that the organic material they contain – amino acids and other prebiotic molecules – could have combined with simple molecules, such as ammonia and carbon dioxide, to create the first proteins and RNA molecules: the blueprint to build and operate every living entity on Earth.“There is just literally the country’s most interesting meteorite in 400 years and I’m the first person who knew that’s what it was,” Greenwood told reporters. “It was very hard to contain the emotions.”News began to ripple through the meteorite community. Minutes after Greenwood met Wilcock, Luke Daly from the University of Glasgow posted in a group chat: “Holy [––] just got off the phone with Ashley [King], and Richard [Greenwood] met with one of the black rock finders and reckons it a CM chondrite! Ashley is on his way now. Don’t spread this!”Having travelled for nearly four hours on eerily empty tubes and trains from south London, King arrived in Winchcombe. Because of lockdown rules, the Wilcocks set up a small table on the patio to look at his finds.“Watching their faces light up, I started to realise for the first time that this was something really special,” Rob Wilcock told me. The enormity of what had taken place was beginning to sink in. Two days later he looked on as some of the most important names in meteoritics crawled over his front lawn wielding tweezers. Rob had already collected further fragments and built a little protective structure around the area of the driveway where the main mass of the meteorite (the largest section) had landed. Now he was sent up a ladder to check the flat roof for material. Even tiny specks were worth collecting. Cathryn gave the scientists some old toothbrushes to help sweep up the grains. Later, the scientists cut out the square of driveway where the meteorite had landed and transported it to London. There, they attempted to recover more fragments. The tarmac itself would feature in the museum archives along with the plastic bags and Waitrose yoghurt pots that Rob had used to collect the meteorite.In total, 319.5g of the meteorite was recovered from the Wilcocks’ property. They donated everything to the NHM, the Winchcombe Museum and the Wilson Art Gallery and Museum in Cheltenham. “It just seems to have really found the right people to fall on,” King said of the Wilcocks. “It couldn’t have been any better.”Meanwhile King finally received the data from the dark flight model. They now had a potential strewn field: a much smaller, more searchable area where larger pieces of the meteorite could have landed and remained intact. New hunts were organised. Scientists and student volunteers spread out 2 metres apart in lines like police at a crime scene. They walked slowly over the cold fields, heads down, looking for small, black stones that had travelled to Earth from somewhere betweenMarsand Jupiter. It was hard going. Many possible meteorites turned out to be lumps of sheep droppings.View image in fullscreenMeteorites collected at the Museum of Natural History in Vienna.Photograph: Zhanna Tretiakova/AlamyMeteorite hunter and collector Luther Jackson describes this sort of hunt as a mixture of science and detective work. For instance, strewn fields typically have what hunters call a big and a small end. The big end is where larger pieces fall first. The small end is where the smaller pieces, which are lighter and therefore travel further, will land. Within the strewn field Jackson will look for likely places to hunt: “Anywhere with a very uniform surface, such as a football pitch or tennis court, is good.” He makes a point of talking to everyone he meets. “You never know what information will come up, or offers [from people] to let you search their land.” Often he brings a stick with a magnet attached to test rocks. (Not all meteorites are magnetic – those from the moon, for example, are not – but most are, being rich in iron. Some scientists discourage the use of magnets because they can erase any record of the magnetic field of the meteorite’s parent body.) It’s slow, back-breaking work.In Winchcombe the scientists’ efforts were finally rewarded when Mira Ihasz, a volunteer with the University of Glasgow search team, found a stone weighing 152g – the largest intact piece. The main mass recovered from the Wilcocks’ driveway was not “intact”, having fractured into millimetre- to centimetre-sized pieces and powder.If the British countryside – with its rain, mud, vegetation, sheep’s droppings and so on – is far from ideal meteorite-hunting territory, the Sahara is its opposite. Dark meteorites stand out against the sand, and even very old falls are often well preserved in the dry desert climate, meaning there are an estimated tens of thousands of years’ worth of fallen meteorites waiting to be discovered.Towards the end of the 20th century, these facts – combined with a favourable legal and geopolitical situation and the presence of many skilled local hunters, often members of nomadic groups – turned Morocco into one of the world’s greatest exporters of space rocks. The UK has recorded a mere 23 falls and finds. The number of officially recognised Moroccan meteorites exceeds a thousand – though this is described by scientists as “a gross underestimate”. Many meteorites collected in Morocco are not precisely documented and so not attributed specifically to that country. The majority are only submitted for official recognition when they are perceived to have sufficient commercial value.At an auction in 2022 a bean-sized 1.7g fragment from the Winchcombe meteorite went for £9,256, 120 times the value of its weight in gold. In a general way, meteorites can cost anything from a few pounds to hundreds of thousands, their value largely determined by the collecting community.In recent years, as meteorites have grown in popularity, prices have shot up – about which the dealers had mixed feelings. Higher prices are obviously good for the seller but many people complained to me particularly about the rocketing prices commanded by really fresh falls, taking interesting new meteorites out of the reach of the general collecting community.In Morocco, news of a new meteorite fall is liable to bring hundreds of people to the most inhospitable desert locations. Many will be inexperienced and ill-prepared – sometimes with tragic results. “In 2017, there was a fall in July when it was extremely hot and the military told us that two people died because they didn’t have enough water, and they didn’t know where they were,” Hasnaa Chennaoui Aoudjehane, a professor at the Hassan II University of Casablanca, told me.In 1980s Morocco, when Chennaoui was studying for a geology degree, the subject was considered an exclusively male pursuit. Today she is one of the country’s leading meteorite authorities, though she is often still the only woman on trips into the Sahara to hunt for meteorites. Back in 2011, she received a call from the Meteoritical Society, the group that maintains the official register of all known meteorites, asking her to travel to a remote part of southern Morocco near the border with Algeria. There were rumours that a black rock had fallen from the sky. Some reports claimed that it was an incredibly rare meteorite type. Chennaoui accepted the mission.In addition to the risk of getting fatally lost in an often seemingly featureless landscape, dangers include (but are not limited to) scorpions, snakes, shifting sand dunes and buried landmines. “You have to go to the field with people that have a good knowledge of the area. And you have to trust them. I cannot go into the desert with someone that I’ve never travelled with before,” Chennaoui said.View image in fullscreen‘I have never seen anything so nice in my life’ … a Martian meteorite found near Tissint in Morocco.Photograph: APA-PictureDesk/AlamyTo reach the site of the 2011 fall required a five-hour, 45-mile drive along a rocky desert track. “We were in the middle of nowhere. Absolutely nowhere. And when we arrived at the site we found hundreds and hundreds of people. Men, women, children. People had heard that there were rocks coming from the sky and that they had value.”Though she personally found only tiny fragments of the meteorite that together weighed much less than 1g, Chennaoui conducted interviews, documented locations and saw stones found by other meteorite hunters. The stones looked as though they’d been dipped in black vinyl. “I have never seen anything so nice in my life; the fusion crust is so shiny, and very black,” she said in an interview for Live Science. Altogether 7kg of the meteorite were collected. On 17 January 2012, the Meteoritical Society formally added the meteorite to their register. It was named Tissint after the village nearest to the fall site. Most exciting of all was where this meteorite was found to have originated: the planet Mars.It is stupendously rare to witness a fall from Mars. Fewer than 0.3% of meteorites in collections are from the red planet. And like Winchcombe, Tissint is distinguished by having fallen in a dry area and been picked up soon afterwards with minimal contamination. Chennaoui was the lead author on the first Tissint report, working with 20 researchers from different countries. She was even able to see evidence of weathering that had occurred on Mars’s surface. It was almost as if it had just been blasted off the surface of Mars.Meteorite hunting can be a frustrating pastime. You might have access to camera footage and sophisticated weather data, or live next to an optimum meteorite hunting site, but you can’t influence when a space rock will decide to drop in. At a meteorite show in France I met Thierry Monter, a French meteorite dealer and graphic designer. On his stand was a semicircle of tarmac that on closer inspection turned out to be part of a tennis court. In February 2023 Monter was abroad, on holiday with his girlfriend, when he heard about a new meteorite fall back in France. “It was just horrible,” he told me. “The worst vacation of my life! I was waiting for years for a meteorite fall and then it happened in France and I wasn’t there! I was checking the news every day and watching as pieces were found.”View image in fullscreenMeteorite fragment found at Saint-Pierre-le-Viger in north-west France.Photograph: Lou Benoist/AFP/Getty ImagesAs soon as he arrived home, Monter set out for the fall site in Saint-Pierre-le-Viger in Normandy. He was seven days late and knew that most of the decent spots would already have been picked over but decided to try his luck on a local tennis court. (A good place to hunt because there was a large flat surface with no grass or bushes.) “I saw something that looked like gravel but there was a sparkle on it!’ He’d found his first meteorite. Then he found some more, and then some more. In total he collected about 400g in many pieces, some of which he was selling at the show. Because it had smashed apart on impact you could see the dark black fusion crust on the outside and a creamy interior studded with rust-coloured spots. He was also selling the very, very small impact crater that the meteorite had made on the tennis court. “I am not rich. Quite the contrary in fact. And if I earn some big money I could turn being a meteorite dealer into my job,” he said.For Monter, the fact that the meteorite had landed in France of all countries made it even more significant. When, out of all the places on the planet a meteorite could land, it lands in our place, the vast otherness of space comes into direct contact with our earthbound everyday lives. Recently a bright fireball was sighted over the English Midlands. The chair of a greenhouse factory in Cresswell, a village in the middle of the search area, was interviewed by the press. “We were just amazed that such a thing could happen in our little corner of Staffordshire,” he said.The dark universe: can a scientist battling long Covid unlock the mysteries of the cosmos?Read moreIn Winchcombe, the Wilcocks have installed a small metal plaque on their driveway to commemorate the place their meteorite landed. Wherever they fall, these remarkable, unlikely stones seem to demand from us an act of witness.This incredible thing; it happened here.A wooden post in Essex commemorates the 1923 Ashdon meteorite; a brick pillar in Yorkshire the 1795 Wold Cottage fall; a sculpture in Alsace the 1492 Ensisheim event. Such monuments seek to fix in place and time something transient.

The people in Not Going Home, a new photo book by Mischa Haller, have all taken the second option. Some have gone to soak up the alcohol in their stomachs with a pizza or a kebab. Others have wandered off with friends and new acquaintances in the hope that – maybe, just maybe – the night will never end. They finish up on beaches or grime-flecked streets, reading the morning papers as the city begins to stir.View image in fullscreenEdinburgh, 5am, August 1998Haller was no stranger to this question himself. “I grew up near the Swiss border and we would go clubbing in Austria because it was much more fun,” he says. “We would always stay until the very last note of the last song – which in the club we went to was always Return to Sender by Elvis.”He realised he loved nightclubs so much that he wanted to be behind a camera, capturing all the action. He worked in Paris for a while as a club photographer, but it was a visit to shoot London’s nightlife in the mid-1990s that changed everything. Haller liked the capital so much that he ended up moving there, getting a job shooting clubbers for “ladette” magazine Minx, a sort of female version of Loaded.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenCardiff, 6am, September 1998, and Edinburgh, 6.05am, August 1998At some point the idea came up: ‘What if we shoot not justinthe club but after the club too,’ At festivals like Creamfields, I always loved that moment when the sun came up in the morning. I did a test in London and went around Brixton and Vauxhall and that’s where the first photographs of this project came about. The magazine liked them and commissioned me to go around the whole of the UK in the summer of 1998 doing the same thing. I went to Leeds, Brighton, Birmingham, Edinburgh and Cardiff.The book seems to capture two distinct kinds of nightlife. There are the lairy crowds who have been drinking and are acting up for the camera – probably heading for a takeaway before sloping off home. And then there are the ravers, still caught up in the buzz of the night, hoping to eke out some more time before accepting the party is over. “I think this image captures that feeling of wanting the night to go on for ever,” says Haller, “to keep it going as long as you can. Because you’re all together in this situation, all the friends you went out with that night, so you have a special connection that you don’t want to break. So you squeeze out as much from the moment as you can.”‘It was mayhem!’View image in fullscreenEdinburgh, 5am, August 1998Each city has a different vibe. Brighton was really all about the beach and everybody chilling and just coming down. But then in Edinburgh it was just mayhem and I absolutely loved it. I think this place is called Pizza Paradise. As a photographer you walk on to a scene like this and you’re like: ‘Oh my God! I’ve won the lottery today! People were acting completely mad. One person was licking the windows!View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenBrighton, 5.45am and Birmingham, 6.50am, August 1998I think the fact this series is all pre-phone matters. Nobody has a phone in their hands and nobody is taking pictures of themselves either. It all seems a bit more carefree than today. I think the 90s were this carefree decade, after the fall of the Berlin Wall but pre 9/11. There was this amazing decade where we were just interested in having a good time. Because we thought it was all over and everything would be fine!‘A beautiful hour’View image in fullscreenBrixton, south London, 5.30am, June 1998Sometimes I would follow people around and say: ‘Can I be with you for like an hour and just see what you do?’ And they were like: ‘Yeah, no problem!’ So they had kind of their own personal paparazzi following them around and they loved it. In this image, you can see one guy was a bit like ‘Who is this guy?’ but the rest are all fine with me being there!Despite the hedonism on display, Haller didn’t get involved with the raving. “No!” he laughs. “I was very Swiss, so I didn’t party. I realised I needed to be fit at 5am. I would get to my hotel, go to bed at 10pm and get up at 4.30am.” Starting the day so early was a boon for a photographer looking for a unique angle. “It’s a great time, really quiet. But also I love the light at that time. As a photographer, you always want this kind of light you get one hour before the sun rises. It’s a really beautiful hour.”View image in fullscreenBrixton, south London, 5.30am, June 1998This image ended up being the cover of the book. She’s kind of recovered but he’s still half gone. By going out at this time, you would come across situations that look more real. You will never get somebody to let go as much as when you shoot them at 4am or 5am, when they’re not really in control of what they’re doing. I think you get a more honest, more real photograph.View image in fullscreenBrighton, 7.30am, August 1998Could these photos have been taken anywhere other than the UK? Haller doesn’t think so, believing that the country boasts a unique, gung-ho spirit when it comes to debauchery. “That’s why I like it here. There’s a certain freedom and a certain chaos that Britain seems to enjoy. People want to get off their heads and forget about everything. It’s like there is creativity in chaos.”Haller sent his images toPaul Wright at the British Culture Archive, which not only showcases excellent amateur photography, but also shines a light on previously unsung professionals, such as Tish Murtha. “I love the series,” he says. “It captures that great last era and freedom of youth, one I feel privileged to have been part of. Little did we know where we were heading with the digital age and how it would change society, but these images capture those post-hedonistic nights and hazy early mornings beautifully.”View image in fullscreenBirmingham, 5.15am, August 1998You can see that the woman sitting on the guy’s lap here is wearing a Mr Egg shirt, which is the fast food spot where this was taken. It’s a Birmingham institution.“I knew I had stories in my archive that had been underused,” says Haller. He started trawling through them and, in January 2024, began scanning all his early morning clubber shots. He sent them to Wright, who promptly put up twoInstagram posts– the first got 9,000 likes and the second managed 16,000. “This was just a dead project up until that point, so I was like ‘Oh my God!’” says Haller.View image in fullscreenBrighton, 7am, August 1998People began asking if a book was available and, after a chat with Wright, it was agreed that Not Going Home would be the first photo book to be published by the British Culture Archive.The project resonates with my generation – generation X – because we’ve all lived through it. It reminds them of their youth. Some people in the book have already been in touch to say it’s them in the photo – the blond guy from the Brighton beach pictures thought it was fantastic, and one of the girls from the Birmingham McDonald’s shoot also recognised herself from the Instagram post.View image in fullscreenBirmingham, 6am, August 1998Teenagers love the images too. When I show them to my daughters, they think it’s cool because the fashion is back. They actually wear those white sneakers again! Besides, I think the idea of staying up all night and partying and having a good time is definitely still there!Explore more on these topicsThe Guardian picture essayClubbingPhotographyShareReuse this content"

There has also been a delay to allow for a verdict from Donald Trump’s administration in the US.Speaking in the Mauritian national assembly on Tuesday, Ramgoolam said he had discussed the plans with Starmer in a phone call on Friday.“The British prime minister informed me that he intends to push ahead with the agreement reached between Mauritius and the United Kingdom on the Chagos archipelago,” Ramgoolam said. “We remain confident that it will reach a speedy resolution in the coming weeks.”Asked about his comments, a Downing Street spokesperson said they would not give “a running commentary on the deal”.He added: “Once an agreement is reached, further details of the treaty will be put before both houses [of parliament] for scrutiny and treaty ratification in the usual way. I think we have already set out in recent weeks, clearly there is a new US administration in place and as we have previously said it is absolutely right that it has the chance to consider the agreement in full.”Under the plan, the UK would lease the military base for 99 years at an annual rate initially estimated to cost about £9bn over the course of the arrangement.However, in his comments on Tuesday, Ramgoolam indicated that the amount could double, as under the revised plan the payments would be linked to inflation. He said: “We have to be inflation-proof. What’s the point of getting money and then having half of it by the end?”A UK government source said they did not recognise the idea of the final cost being close to £18bn.The Conservatives have fiercely criticised the plan, despite having begun the negotiations when they were in power. In an official opposition response, the shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, said Starmer was “putting his lefty shame of our country’s history over our national security”.The shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, went further, calling Starmer a quisling, an offensive term meaning a traitor or collaborator.Explore more on these topicsChagos IslandsForeign policyMauritiusAfricaKeir StarmerLabournewsShareReuse this content"

In 2023, the agency managed more than $40bn (£32bn).Countless aid organisations have already been forced to close down or lay off staff.Analysis confirms thatseveral thousand women and girls are likely to diefrom complications during pregnancy and childbirth as a direct result of Trump’s order to freeze aid to the agency for 90 days.View image in fullscreenProtesters at the USAid headquarters on 3 February 2025 in Washington DC after Donald Trump’s decision to close the agency.Photograph: Kayla Bartkowski/Getty ImagesTrump has tasked the billionaire Musk – who has falsely accused USAid of beinga “criminal” organisation– with scaling down the US government’s lead agency for humanitarian assistance.The impact on the global aid sector has been profound and immediate. US foreign aid accounts for four out of every $10 spent globally on humanitarian aid.One former seniorUSAidofficial described Musk’s crackdown as an “extinction-level event” for the international humanitarian sector.The initial repercussions include the abandonment in warehouses of supplies of crucial drugs in Sudan, the site of what is currently the world’sworst humanitarian crisis, as well as in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), whererecent fightingin the east has further destabilised the fragile region.AcrossAfrica, hundreds of thousands of children who rely on school meals have been left without sustenance after food was left to rot in the wake of Musk’s declaration that he wanted the US aid agency to “die”.“Partners on the ground [are saying] that in DRC andSudan, medical supplies are stuck in warehouses,” said a spokesperson for a leading international aid organisation.Like many aid workers the Guardian interviewed, the spokesperson requested anonymity, amid claims that officials from theTrump administrationhave put pressure on those in the humanitarian sector not to speak out. Many were also reluctant to talk on the record over fears of future funding,Among the projects already forced to close is a girls’ education project in Nepal, raising the risk of a rise in child marriage and trafficking.“All payments are frozen for these projects. There’s a lot of misinformation. Organisations are having to make decisions in a vacuum,” said one humanitarian official.View image in fullscreenPatients at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Dhaka, Bangladesh in April 2018 after an outbreak of disease in the city.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesIn Bangladesh,the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, which coordinates pioneering research into one of the most prolific killers of children, has laid off some of the world’s most respected scientists working on malaria programmes.In Africa, malaria-control programmes in Uganda have been forced to adopt equally draconian measures with reports that dozens of vital projects for frontline care have been closed.Farther south inMalawi, where many rely on donor-funded programmes for survival, fears are mounting that the aid freeze could redraw the country’s entire economy.Within farming communities – the backbone of Malawi’s economy – Mike Dansa, chair of theNsanje Civil Society Organisati­on, warned it could upend agricultural aid programmes that support smallholders with improved seeds, irrigation and climate-resilience projects, threatening food security in a country reeling from extreme weather events.View image in fullscreenUSAid’s global food crisis coordinator, Dina Esposito, and the US special envoy for global food security, Cary Fowler, on a visit to farmers in Malawi in 2023.Photograph: USAid MalawiIn Johannesburg, projects that have relied for more than 20 years on funding from the US HIV/Aids response programme, known as Pepfar, have had to lock their doors.Dawie Nel, director of a Johannesburg LGBTQ+ clinic called Out, said his organisation, which looks after 6,000 clients, had suspended its treatment. “The US is a totally unreliable partner,” he said.Across the Atlantic, similar scenes of chaos were playing out. InColombia, which has been plagued by six decades of internal conflict and drug-related violence, large numbers of organisations rely on USAid funding.Programmes providing emergency relief to families fleeing violence between armed groups and encouraging farmers to swap coca – the base ingredient of cocaine – for legal alternatives have ceased operating.Colombia’s former president and Nobel peace prize laureate, Juan Manuel Santos, told the Guardian: “I have seen the massive benefit these programmes funded by USAid have generated for people across the country. To cut it, suddenly, is going to have a terrible humanitarian effect.”Elsewhere, the director of a major international aid organisation in Colombia – who also requested anonymity – feared the impact on those who most needed help. “The people who this is going to affect the most are those already without a safety net. Precisely those who are least able to find another source of food, shelter or income,” they said.However, some have argued that the disruption has exposed the fragility of development programmes that are reliant on external aid.The former Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta urged African countries to view the aid freeze as a “wake-up call” for the continent to prioritise its own development.“Nobody is going to continue holding out a hand to give you. It is time for us to use our resources for the right things,” he said.View image in fullscreenA smallholder farmer in Colombia who has received funding as part of a project encouraging farmers to swap growing coca for legal alternatives.Photograph: USAid ColombiaMost, though, are adamant that the intention of Trump and Musk – who heads an unofficial cost-cutting agency – to close USAid is disastrous.“Without naming countries or areas, we have had to close life-saving services, for children with acute malnutrition, and also testing and treatment sites for health facilities, nutrition facilities and wash facilities,” said one aid worker.Jeremy Konyndyk, president of Refugees International and a former official at USAid, described Musk’s wish to close the agency as posing an existential threat to the humanitarian sector.View image in fullscreenUnplanned pregnancy information poster in Kampala, Uganda, where 11.7 million women and girls will be denied access to contraception under the freeze.Photograph: Godong/Universal/Getty“If this goes forward, it really is an extinction-level event for the global aid sector in the US and for much of the global relief and development sector around the world.”Konyndyk added that it would also “destabilise” budgets of many large aid and United Nations organisations around the world. “It threatens really the collapse not just of what USAid does, but of this huge ecosystem of relief and development organisations that are doing good around the world every day,” he said.Trump’s aid freeze shuts down ‘gold standard’ famine-monitoring systemRead moreResearch from theGuttmacher Instituteunderlined such warnings, revealing that 11.7 million women and girls will be denied access to contraceptive care over the course of the 90-day aid freeze, which they predict means 8,340 women and girls would die from complications during pregnancy and childbirth.Elsewhere, concern over the fate of the humanitarian sector was laid bare in a survey of 342 international development organisations, which concluded that without US funding, more than half were likely to close before May.Attempts by the US government to soften the impact of its freeze by unveiling a waiver for projects offering “life-saving assistance” appears to have done little except prompt further confusion.“Is Plumpy’Nut [a paste used to feed severely malnourished children] life-saving? Is a vaccine life-saving? What is a life-saving part of a project? What qualifies under the waiver?” an aid worker asked.A “global aid freeze”trackerhas been set up to look at the collective impact of the orders, inviting civil society organisations to input data.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentUSAidAidElon MuskHumanitarian responseTrump administrationUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The island has never had electricity, and there are no tarred roads, only footpaths.For power, its residents, mostly fishers or cassava, rice and corn farmers, rely on generators running on fuel that has become costly since a subsidy was scrappedtwo years ago. Water, which comes from the Lekki Lagoon – a site for open defecation as there are no proper toilet facilities – and wells, is poured on to improvised filters consisting of old cloths spread on basins.The island has never had a hospital, and its only healthcare centre closed several years ago. In the only school, which serves children of nursery and primary school age, some classrooms were shut a few years ago after their roofs started caving in. For further education, pupils have to take a boat ride to a nearby island.Every time Yinka Banjo, a leader of one of the communities on the island, leaves the island, he carries his power bank and device chargers steadfastly, like passports to civilisation.“There is nothing here, we are as you see now,” he said.View image in fullscreenThe closed healthcare centre on Refuge Island, where people lack basic facilities such as electricity and running water.Photograph: Eromo Egbejule/The GuardianFor years, supporters of Nigeria’s ruling All Progressives Congress have held up Lagos as a testament to the vision of the party’s leader, the country’s president, Bola Tinubu. The megacity – comprising a mainland core connected to multiple islands by several lagoons beside the Atlantic – and state of the same name would be among Africa’s 10 largest economies if it were a standalone country. Tinubu, a two-term Lagos governor, influenced the selection of his successors to “guide the state to prosperity”, as his supporters say.Running east to west below Refuge Island is the Lekki peninsula, which has since the 1990s undergone rapid development that has made it one of Nigeria’s most prosperous neighbourhoods, home to upmarket malls, a recently launched deepwater seaport, and the world’s largest single-train oil refinery.A map of Lagos and the Gulf of GuineaBeyond the refinery and port, two forgotten islands lie hidden in plain sight in the lagoon: uninhabited Ita-Oko, which used to host a prison and then a drug rehabilitation centre, and Refuge Island.Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour, an architect and opposition politician, said the island, with its white sands and swaying coconut and palm trees, has the potential to become a tourist haven where “artists live in communes that sell locally-made artefacts”.View image in fullscreenLekki peninsula, close to Refuge Island, has undergone rapid development, and now has a deepwater seaport.Photograph: Xinhua/AlamyFor now, its residents wait endlessly for the government to even acknowledge their existence.One resident who did not want to be named said a former state governor had arranged for a borehole to be dug and a solar power system installed about 20 years ago. The borehole collapsed after three years. “We appreciated it,” the resident said. “But since then, [silence].”There are many riverine communities around Lagos that have been left behind by the boom times and often lack basic amenities. Some house the descendants of people who migrated from the Benin Republic a century or more ago.Rhodes-Vivour said poor communities were being excluded by development in the state. “The vision is to look like Dubai,” he said. “But you have a 70% poverty rate. Most of people cannot afford to live in Dubai-like conditions … development needs to be a lot more even.”Taibat Lawanson, a professor of urban planning at the universities of Liverpool and Lagos, said some communities were being excluded from development projects because of questions about their ancestry. “Often there is a narrative that residents are not Nigerians and that they are there illegally, essentially looking away from the fact that everybody who is born in Nigeria is a Nigerian national no matter the nationality of their parents,” she said.One elder on Refuge Island said no major government project had been initiated since the 1980s.Residents say senior politicians have never visited the island, even for political campaigns. Nevertheless, the ruling party and its previous iteration has come first in voting on the island in every national election since the return to democracy in 1999. Rhodes-Vivour claims this comes down to the practice of politicians sending some food or money to inhabitants on the eve of election day. The APC was approached for comment.In recent years the plight of places such as Refuge Island has become more well-known as middle class Lagosians have sought out tranquil environments where they can escape from the city. In some instances the city dwellers have initiated small-scale interventions alongside resort owners to tidy up communities.Experts like Lawanson say these interventions and government’s “benevolence approach to development, especially when it comes to vulnerable groups” need to end and the focus needs to shift to schemes that tackle systemic inequality.But even short-term relief is acceptable for the locals on Refuge Island, who say they are tired of waiting for a miracle. “We did our bit for the government,” said Banjo, referring to support for the APC in elections. “Only God knows when we’ll get our dues.”Explore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Flows of aid, food and other basic goods into the city were all but cut off by the M23 advance, and in recent days humanitarian organisations and the international community have stepped up calls for the creation of safe corridors to get vital items in.On Monday the UN said at least 900 people had died in last week’s fighting between the rebels and Congolese forces. It added that warehouses and offices belonging to aid organisations had been looted, and warned of the spread of mpox, cholera, measles and other diseases due to lack of access to medical care.Foreign ministers from the G7 advanced economies urged parties in the conflict to return to negotiations on Monday and called for a “rapid, safe and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

About 300,000 internally displaced people were forced to flee camps on the city’s outskirts.Last week M23 was reported to be advancing beyond Goma and in the direction of Bukavu, the capital of neighbouring South Kivu province, but on Monday the group claimed it had no intention of seizing more territory. “It must be made clear that we have no intention of capturing Bukavu or other areas,” it said in a statement. “However, we reiterate our commitment to protecting and defending the civilian population and our positions.”‘I went to war.

The Congolese government and several UN reports say in fact Rwanda uses the group as a means to extract and then export valuable minerals for use in products such as mobiles phones.Two regional blocs – the Southern African Development Community and the East African Community (EAC) – will on Friday and Saturday hold a joint summit in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, about the conflict.Kenya’s president, William Ruto, on Monday said Félix Tshisekedi, the DRC president, and the Rwandan president, Paul Kagame, would attend. Last week, Tshisekedi snubbed an emergency virtual summit organised by the EAC.Congolese authorities have in the past said they are open to talks, but that they must factor in previous peace agreements.

We have a constitution, we have all sorts of things, but it’s a very generous offer.”On Tuesday afternoon, Trump said he was exploring the legality of sending dangerous US criminals to prisons in other countries.“If we had the legal right to do it, I’d do it in a heartbeat,” Trump told reporters. “I don’t know that we do. We’re looking at it right now.”On social media, Bukeleconfirmed the offer had been made, saying that he had proposed to the US “the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system” and that he was “willing to take in only convicted criminals (including convicted US citizens) into our mega-prison in exchange for a fee”.The fee, he said, would “be relatively low for the US but significant for us, making our entire prison system sustainable”.Bukelebuilt the “mega-prison”– the largest prison in the Americas – in 2023 to house alleged gang members he has imprisoned since declaring a state of exception in 2022 due to anuptick in violenceby gangs.Since 2022, Bukele has locked up more than 80,000 people – approximately 1.25% of the country’sadult population– as part of his sweeping crackdown on El Salvador’s gangs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The newspaper said an additional flight had departed on Monday.CNN later reported one of the flights had “about nine or 10” people onboard who were detained in the US without valid immigration documents.US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) referred a request for comment from the Guardian to the homeland security department, which did not immediately respond.“President Trump is not messing around, and he’s no longer going to allow America to be a dumping ground for illegal criminals from nations all over this world,” Leavitt told Fox.“Today, the first flights from the United States toGuantánamo Baywith illegal migrants are under way.”Donald Trump last week signed anexecutive orderto prepare a huge detention camp at the navy base at Guantánamo that he said could house up to 30,000 people deported from the US.‘America’s gulag’: Trump’s Guantánamo ploy tars migrants as terroristsRead more“Some of them are so bad, we don’t even trust the countries [of origin] to hold them because we don’t want them coming back,” he said. “So we’re going to send them out to Guantánamo. This will double our capacity immediately.”The news of the first flights, containing deportees of unknown nationality, comes a day after El Salvador offered to acceptundocumented migrantsfrom any country – and even incarcerated US citizens. The announcement by El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, followed a visit by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio.Leavitt told Fox that Trump was determined to complete what he has previously called “thelargest deportation effortin American history”, of 15 million to 20 million people, for which he has said he wouldengage the militaryto help achieve it.“El Salvador has not disagreed to the repatriation of [only] their own citizens but also illegal criminals from other nations who will then be sent to their prisons,” she said.“Venezuela as well has agreed to repatriation flights, and Colombia also agreed to cooperate with the repatriation of illegal Colombian nationals that we have found in the interior of our country.”Rubio praised El Salvador’s willingness to accept deportees. “No country’s ever made an offer of friendship such as this. [It is] the most unprecedented and extraordinary migratory agreement anywhere in the world,” he said.Immigration advocates, meanwhile, have expressed concern over the legality of deporting those in the US illegally to countries they are not from.“Obviously, we’ll have to study it on our end; there are obviously legalities involved. We have a constitution, we have all sorts of things,”Rubio saidon Monday.According to the Wall Street Journal, the US naval base at Guantánamo is equipped to hold about 120 people.Known to critics as“America’s gulag”, the facility has housed several people accused of plotting the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the US, as well as others deemed to be “enemy combatants”. Some have been detained for years without trial.Trump’s plan to use it to detain civilians deported from the US further demonizes immigrants, advocates have said.“This is political theater and part of the Trump administration’s broader effort to paint immigrants as threats in the United States … and fan anti-immigrant sentiment,” Eleanor Acer, senior director for refugee protection at Human Rights First,told the Guardian.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationGuantánamo BayDonald TrumpEl SalvadorCubaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He said the deal was set to expire in two to three years, but did not elaborate.“Yesterday’s announcement by President @JoseRaulMulino that Panama will allow its participation in the CCP’s belt and road initiative to expire is a great step forward for US-Panama relations, a free Panama Canal, and another example of @POTUS leadership to protect our national security and deliver prosperity for the American people,” Rubio posted on X after departing the country.Professor Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow at the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations thinktank, said Panama’s “significant” decision to exit the BRI showed an early win for the new Trump administration’s “brinkmanship diplomacy”, but it wouldn’t necessarily be replicated easily.“The US now seems to be increasing its focus on its backyard, Latin America, these countries that still need to rely on US support and trade,” Huang said.“But I’m not sure that the US could use similar influence to force an Asian country, for example, to make similar concessions. It’s unlikely givenChinais already the most influential actor in that region.”China’s embassy in Washington did not respond immediately to a request for comment on the initiative or canal issues.Panama was the first Latin American country to officially endorse the BRI in November 2017, five months after switching diplomatic ties from Taiwan to China.China rejects western criticism of the initiative, saying more than 100 countries have joined it, and that it has boosted global development with new ports, bridges, railways and other projects.Nonetheless, it has faced controversy, with some partner nations criticising thehigh cost of projectsand struggling to repay loans. Italywithdrew from the initiativein 2023 amid US pressure over concerns about Beijing’s economic reach.Tension and defiance in Panama after Trump threatens to ‘take back’ canalRead moreSuch US concerns have long extended to some Chinese companies’ operations near the Panama Canal, including a Hong Kong-based firm operating two ports, one at each end of the waterway that was built by the US in the early 20th century and then handed over to Panama in 1999.Two Chinese state-owned firms are separately building a fourth bridge over one of the canal’s entrances.The US state department said on Sunday that Rubio delivered a message from Trump that China’s presence there was a threat to the canal and a violation of the US-Panama treaty.After talks with Rubio, Mulino signalled a willingness to review the 25-year concession to Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings, renewed in 2021 for the operation of the two entrance ports, pending the results of an audit.The contract has been targeted by US lawmakers and the government as an example of China’s expansion in Panama, which they say goes against a neutrality treaty signed by both countries in 1977.Rubio, speaking to reporters after landing in San Salvador on the next leg of his Latin American trip, called Mulino a friend to the US, and Panama a strong partner and ally. He said his visit had achieved “potentially really good things”.“We don’t want to have a hostile or negative relationship with Panama,” Rubio said.Ryan Berg, director of theAmericasProgram at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the audit could provide a way to unwind the concessions if it shows the deals were marred by corruption.“That provides more legal framework for Panama to wiggle out of the concessions and for Panama to reopen them such that an American company or a European company might come in and win the bid,” Berg said.Explore more on these topicsPanamaMarco RubioChinaBelt and road initiativeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Several US companies were also added to China’s “unreliable entity” list, potentially restricting their ability to conduct business in the country.China’s response stands in stark contrast to the reaction from the other countries hit by Trump’s trade war 2.0,Mexico and Canada. After last-ditch negotiations on Monday involving the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and the Mexican president,Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump agreed to pause plans to impose tariffs of 25% on both countries. Inexchange for the reprieve, Trudeau promised to appoint a fentanyl czar and strengthen border security, while Sheinbaum offered to send 10,000 troops to the border with the US.A deal with China may still be on the cards. Trump is expected to speak to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in the coming days and China’s tariffs do not come into effect until 10 February. But Beijing has repeatedly said it has already done plenty to address Trump’s official justification for the tariffs: the flow of fentanyl from China to the US.It is also widely acknowledged that Trump’s tariffs have another target in sight: the US’s large trade deficit with China, which reached $25bn (£20bn) in November 2024. In a memo published on his first day in office, Trump promised to “investigate the causes of our country’s large and persistent annual trade deficits”.The speed at which China announced countermeasures to his tariffs suggests the country was well-prepared.“China is not afraid of the US in the tariff war, and in the past seven years we have known that Trump will push further,” said Wang Wen, the dean of the Chongyang institute for financial studies at Renmin University in Beijing. “China believes that this will not be the last tariff increase.”Since Trump last instigated a trade war with Beijing during his first term, Wang said China had learned to “dare to fight … to defend its core interests”.Other analysts noted that Beijing’s response this time seemed more cautious than in 2018.The tariffs it imposed in 2018 appeared to be designed to cause Trump maximum political harm. It put a 25% levy on US agricultural products, causing economic pain to farmers in Republican-supporting states and damaging Trump’s base. This time it has imposed levies on US exports that have limited exposure to China such as liquified natural gas and crude oil.“When the US tariffs took effect, China launched another tariff. I think it is quite normal,” Steven Leung of UOB Kay Hian, a Singaporean brokerage firm, told Reuters. “China is trying to get some bargaining power before getting close to the negotiating table. It doesn’t mean that they will not go for negotiation talks.”“My impression is that this is mostly about face, and also also its domestic audience,” said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, the chief economist for theAsia Pacificat Natixis, a bank. “It is not really a full escalation but a posture.”China’s economy isless well-equippedto withstand an escalating trade war than it was in 2018. Trump has also become more of a known quantity, and is seen in Beijing as being a dealmaker who can be negotiated with.The economy has become more reliant on exports since 2018. The pandemic battered domestic demand and a regulatory crackdown on the real estate sector torpedoed investment in the industry that used to be a key driver of GDP growth.In likely anticipation of Trump tariffs, Chinese exports to the US surged in December, increasing by 16% compared with December 2023. They grew by 5% over 2024 as a whole. China’s annual global trade surplus reached nearly $1trn, a record high.Trump tariffs: which countries are affected and what does this mean?Read moreEconomists at Ing noted earlier this month: “While we are not as pessimistic as many in markets on the impact of tariffs on China’s growth trajectory, it’s likely that for China to be able to see stable growth in 2025, we will need to see the domestic demand side picking up the slack.”The other option available to Beijing to stop the trade war in its tracks is to emulate Mexico and Canada and strike a deal. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that China was considering resurrecting the “phase one” trade deal signed in 2020. Under that deal, it agreed to increase purchases of certain US goods by at least $200bn in 2020 and 2021, but itfell around 60% short of its commitments.The WSJ reported that policymakers in Beijing were considering if there were other areas where China could buy more from the US, especially in sectors vital to its own economic development, such as semiconductors. The US has banned the export of the most advanced chips to China, something that Beijing sees as containment.The fate of TikTok, the video-sharing app owned by the Chinese company Bytedance that is facing a ban in the US, may also be on the negotiating table. Trump signed an executive order delaying the ban by 75 days on his first day in office.The first high-level face-to-face meeting between the US and China seems likely to happen at a UN security council meeting on 18 February. China’s UN envoy, Fu Cong, said on Monday that it would be a very good opportunity for the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, and the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, to meet. “So much is at stake,” he said.Explore more on these topicsChinaTrump administrationInternational tradeAsia PacificEconomicsGlobal economyUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

The documentary, over which Flynn said he had no editorial control, provoked an angry response from the Cambodian government, which accused it ofspreading false information.Human Rights Watch said the decision to ban Flynn was a “blatant attack on journalism” that served as yet another reminder of the Cambodian authorities’ “intolerance of critical and investigative journalism”.The Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Thailand also condemned the development, saying in a statement it was “another nail in the coffin of the free press in Cambodia, which has seen local and foreign journalists severely intimidated in recent years and numerous news organisations driven out of business”.The FCCT cited thekilling of Chhoeung Chhengfrom the Kampuchea Aphiwat news website. The death of Chheng, who was shot while reporting on the transport of alleged illegally cut timber in Siem Reap province, provoked outrage among media groups. A government spokesperson told media at the time that the incident was being taken seriously, and reiterated the government’s commitment to protecting press freedom. A gunman was arrested.The FCCT also pointed to the treatment of Mech Dara, one of Cambodia’s best-known investigative journalists, renowned for his work exposing “pig butchering” scam centres operating in Cambodia, who was arrested in September andreleased only after he apologised for his work.Cambodia, which ranks near the bottom of international press freedom rankings, was ruled by the dictator Hun Sen for almost four decades. Hehanded power to his sonHun Manet in 2023 shortly after elections that were widely criticised as a sham.Flynn told the Guardian that in the five years he had been based in Cambodia, the situation for media had deteriorated year by year. “We’ve seen more arrests, more lawsuits, more harassment, both physical and online. We’ve even had journalists killed,” he said.“The government’s intolerance towards anything that they deem critical has made it very risky for all journalists in Cambodia to continue operating.”Almost all independent media outlets have been shut down or silenced. Voice of Democracy was shut down in February 2023, while Cambodia Daily was closed in 2017, and the Phnom Penh Post sold to a PR company.This meant that very few journalists in Cambodia have full-time jobs now, said Flynn. “The only ones that remain are relatively small and poorly funded,” he added.Flynn, who is also president of the Overseas Press Club of Cambodia, was told he was banned from the country due to an error on a document submitted as part of his visa extension application, according to Mongabay. However, his visa extension had been approved and was valid until 15 February 2025, the outlet said.Immigration officials have refused to provide information to Flynn directly or through the British embassy in Phnom Penh regarding his options for an appeal, Mongabay said.The International Federation for Human Rights and the Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the blacklisting of Flynn.Shawn Crispin, CPJ’s senior south-east Asia representative, said: “If Cambodia really wants to save its forests, the country needs more, not fewer, watchdog journalists like Flynn. The reality is Cambodia’s predators of the press are knocking down environmental reporters as fast as its forests are falling.”The Cambodian government has not yet responded to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsCambodiaCensorshipFreedom of speechJournalist safetyAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

For now, it’s all he has – and it might be all he ever has of the sibling he revered.“We were so close, we were together every day,” Shamikh says from his home inSydney, where he is studying for a PhD. “He was two years older than me, so I looked up to him. He looked after me at school, we would walk there together, and he was so funny.”In early December 2023, Ehab Badra received a call from the Israeli military warning his apartment building in Gaza City would be a target.He fled the building for a friend’s place, but days later – believing the bombardment to have subsided – returned with his family. Ehab, his wife, Salwa, and his four children, Mohanad, Sama, Ayham and Aya, have not been seen since.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailAustralia grants nearly 1,000 humanitarian visas in three months to those fleeing Israel-Hamas conflictRead more“We fear they are lost under the rubble, like so many. That is our great fear, that he is there, with his wife, with his children … they went there and they were buried alive.“It is a tragedy for humanity, and our whole family is waiting to know their fate: what happened?”Caught up in secondary strikes, or lost among the chaos of the war’s height, Shamikh says the agony of knowing his brother and his family are likely dead is compounded by not having a definitive answer on what happened to them. From the quiet distance of suburban Sydney, Shamikh feels a sense of helplessness. He and his other siblings are spread all over the world. They spend their days and nights in shifts, trying to piece together information on what might have happened.View image in fullscreenShamikh Badra’s photographs of his brother and his brother’s children who are missing in Gaza, presumed dead. ‘We fear they are lost under the rubble, like so many.’Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianIn the days after Ehab vanished, Shamikh and friends and family called his brother’s phone repeatedly; in another part ofGazahis father was dying from a lack of medication. Ehab was urged to come home, to return to his father’s house. It appears, Shamikh says, his phone messages were read but there was never a reply.Shamikh’s greatest fear is his brother lay trapped under the rubble, alive but unable to respond, perhaps for days.“I can’t bear to think about their suffering.”Shamikh’s family are far from alone. There are thousands of families bearing similar questions. The losses and the uncertainties radiate outwards, to families across Gaza, across occupied Palestine, around the world.TheUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs(OCHA) says the death toll in Gaza is 47,354, with more than 111,000 people injured since 7 October 2023, when Hamas-led fighters killed more then 1,200 Israelis and took 250 hostages. Ninety-one Israeli hostages remain held in Gaza.The bombs that have been dropped on our families in Gaza are made by AmericaShamikh BadraBut the official Gaza death toll is believed to be a vast underestimate, with the number killed understated by as much as 40%, according to research published in medical journal, the Lancet.The UN’s OCHA says it is believed thousands of the missing remain uncounted in official figures.“There are also an estimated 10,000 people presumed dead and missing under the rubble that Palestinian civil defence have not been able to reach,” an update said.Shamikh says he is contemplating returning to Gaza, to assist his ageing mother and to search for his missing relatives. But even if bodies can be found, there are few technical resources – such as DNA testing – available to definitively confirm their identities.In addition, Shamikh has little faith that the current fragile ceasefire can hold, and the dynamics of a new Trump administration, he says, make a precarious future even more uncertain.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But there is no guarantee the ceasefire will lead to sustainable peace.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gazahave walked into the devastated north of the strip, back to homes and businesses and neighbourhoods that have been laid waste by 15 months of war.But there is trepidation, still, for the future.1:05IDF expands military raids in West Bank using bulldozers in Tulkarm – video reportShamikh says his family “won’t leave Gaza”.“We cannot be forced to leave our land, leave our homes. We can’t leave behind our family there.”But he says the current impasse is a painful oblivion. Mourning a relative whose fate is unknown is an incomplete, insufficient act.His family cannot perform burial or funeral rituals, Shamikh says, and he feels he has not been able to properly say goodbye. It has been more than a year, but some in his family still refuse to countenance his brother has gone.“Still my mother is waiting for him to come back.

Heatwave conditions are triggered when an area is hotter than90% of recorded temperaturesfor that time of year over at least five consecutive days.Dr Andrew Pershing, the chief program officer at Climate Central, which has adapted climate attribution methods for studying major weather events on land to the ocean, said the escalating heat seen off the coast of WA was “not a normal event”.Jo Haylen’s swift exit after a series of own goals shows NSW Labor has learnt from past mistakesRead more“This is an event that is directly tied to burning fossil fuels,” he said.The group’sOcean Climate Shift Indexdrew on satellite data from organisations including the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and applied 13 climate models, to isolate the effect of carbon pollution from human activities, Pershing said.Nearly 90%of marine heatwaves were now attributable to human-caused global heating and are expected to increase in frequency, intensity and duration as fossil fuel emissions continue to rise, previous studies have found.11:29Ove Hoegh-Guldberg received death threats for his work. He kept fighting anyway – videoMarine heatwaves caused “prolonged thermal stress” to marine life, which authorities say probably contributed to the mass fish kill observed at beaches along WA’s Pilbara coast.Australia was “on the frontline” of these effects, Pershing said. These events led to fish kills and coral bleaching and had widespread consequences for industries including fishing and tourism.A marine heatwave off the WA coast in 2010-11 damaged more than athird of seagrass meadowsin Shark Bay.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As well as effects on marine life, this additional energy could translate into severe weather events including tropical cyclones.WA’s unusual marine heat was continuing to escalate. In January, ocean temperatures were consistently at least 1.6C hotter than average, according to Climate Central.Pershing said marine heatwaves weren’t random. They were connected to climate change, he said, and becoming more intense and frequent as humans continued to pollute the atmosphere.“Humans are affecting the planet in a lot of ways.

There wouldn’t be any attacks on civilian infrastructure, civilians, rapes.”Setting up a tribunal, she said, was also about “putting pressure” on Putin and the regime “to really stop this war, and also to give a clear signal to other aggressors or would-be aggressors who are or may be contemplating attacking neighbouring countries”.Talks, which began last June between the EU,Ukraine, pan-European human rights body the Council of Europe (CoE) and 37 other countries, had been held up over whether Putin and other Russian leaders should be granted immunity. As a compromise, it is understood that Putin and senior figures would not be prosecuted while in office.In a separate development, Ukraine’s presidentVolodymyr Zelenskyysaid he would agree to direct talks with Putin to end the war that will reach a grim three-year milestone later this month.British journalist Piers Morgan asked Zelenskyy how he would feel if he sat opposite Putin at a negotiating table.View image in fullscreenEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told reporters: ‘There is no doubt that Putin has committed the crime of aggression, which is deciding to attack another country.’Photograph: Olivier Matthys/EPA“If that is the only setup in which we can bring peace to the citizens of Ukraine and not lose people, definitely we will go for this setup,” Zelenskyy said, adding that he would also require other “participants” to be present.In the interview with Morgan, Zelenskyy put the Ukrainian death toll at 45,100, with 390,000 injured since the full-scale invasion in February 2022. He estimated the Russian dead to be 350,000, with between 600,000 and 700,000 injured, and said Russian forces had “many” missing in action.The international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague has issued an arrest warrant for Putin and other senior Russian officials over the abduction of Ukrainian children. But it does not have the power to try crimes of aggression, as Russia has not ratified the ICC treaty.Another mooted option is the amendment of the ICC Rome Statute in the UN general assembly, but many experts argue that would be unworkable, as many members of the court have not submitted to its jurisdiction over the crime of aggression.To break the logjam, the CoE, which has 46 member states and expelled Russia after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has offered to host the tribunal.The talks sped up as Donald Trump prepared to return to the White House, throwing uncertainty over US support for Ukraine. Nearly 40 countries have been involved in the talks, aftera plea for justice from Zelenskyy,who has cited “burned cities and tortured people” during the atrocities of Bucha and Mariupol, and missile strikes against ordinary civilians.Iryna Mudra, the deputy head of the office of president Zelenskyy, said Ukraine’s people wanted to hold the invaders accountable “and to show the world that such horrible war crimes will have serious consequences. [Zelenskyy’s] message is clear,” she went on. “Evil must not remain unpunished. Peace must be just. Ukraine cannot and will not compromise on justice.”A Ukrainian Nobel peace laureate, Oleksandra Matviichuk, has alsocalled for the swift creation of a tribunal to try Putin, arguing that it could deter Russian forces from inflicting atrocities on Ukraine.The CoE’s secretary general, Alain Berset, said he hoped work on a text to create the tribunal would be finished this year.Berset, who met Trump in Paris for thereopening of Notre Dame in December, said it was “not so clear” how the tribunal would be affected by any peace talks launched by the US administration: “We try to go as fast as possible in a highly uncertain context.”Berset, a former president of Switzerland, signalled that US support was needed if the tribunal was to work. “I think it’s also clear for everybody that without the G7 [the tribunal] will never fly.”In a related effort to make Russia pay for the damage it has inflicted on Ukraine, the CoE also proposed joining possible talks on an “international claims commission” for Ukraine.Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineEuropeVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

Five of them had gunshot wounds, one of whom has minor injuries.Jonas Claesson, director of health and medical services in the Örebro region, said one of the patients was in a life-threatening condition.Police said they had opened an investigation into murder, arson and an aggravated weapons offence.Sweden shooting: 10 people dead after attack at education centre in Örebro, say police – latest updatesRead moreThe prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, described the attack in the city, which is about 125 miles (200km) west of Stockholm, as a “terrible act of violence” on a “very painful day for all of Sweden”.He said the government was in close contact with police and the operation was continuing.“My thoughts are [also] with all of those whose normal school day was turned into fear. Being locked up in a classroom fearing for your life is a nightmare no one should have to experience.”Police should be allowed “the peace of mind they need to investigate what happened and how these horrific crimes could have occurred”, Kristersson said.“This is the worst mass shooting in Swedish history,” he told reporters, as he urged people not to speculate about the motive.King Carl XVI Gustaf conveyed his condolences. “It is with deep sadness and dismay that my family and I received the news about the terrible atrocity in Örebro,” he said.Map locating the area of Sweden where the shooting took placeMap locating the area of Sweden where the shooting took placeForest gave no further information about the injured. “The reason we cannot be more specific at this time is that the damage outcome is so great,” he said.

It also offers primary and upper secondary school courses as well as classes in Swedish for immigrants, vocational training and programmes for people with disabilities.One teacher, Lena Warenmark, told the broadcaster SVT she had been confined to her study after hearing “gunshots very close”.She said she heard “probably 10 shots” in total, with a short pause between two bursts. She said there had been an unusually small number of students on campus as many had gone home after sitting an exam.Johannes Sjöberg, whose daughter is a student at the campus, told SVT he had been in touch by text message with her throughout after she had arrived at the school about five minutes before the shooting started.“She saw blood and the teachers were good at helping them, bringing them in and locking the door,” Sjöberg said. He said his daughter was safe and was providing information to the police.View image in fullscreenPolice special forces at the scene.Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty ImagesAndreas Sundling, 28, was among those who barricaded themselves inside the campus. “We heard three bangs and loud screams,” he told the Expressen newspaper.All those who took shelter were evacuated by mid-afternoon, police said.Maria Pegado, 54, a teacher at the school, said someone had thrown open the door to her classroom just after lunchbreak and shouted to everyone to get out.“I took all my 15 students out into the hallway and we started running,” she told Reuters. “Then I heard two shots but we made it out. We were close to the school entrance. I saw people dragging injured out, first one, then another. I realised it was very serious.”School attacks are rare in Sweden but several serious incidents have taken place in recent years.

However, Ukrainian media reported that the idea may have originated in Kyiv as an incentive to keep weapon shipments flowing into the country.Speaking to reporters at the White House on Monday, Trump said he wanted “equalisation” fromUkrainefor Washington’s “close to $300bn” in support. “We’re telling Ukraine they have very valuable rare earths,” Trump said. “We’re looking to do a deal with Ukraine where they’re going to secure what we’re giving them with their rare earths and other things.”It was not clear if Trump meant a deal in which Ukraine supplied minerals free of charge in exchange for US military aid, or simply agreed to sell them, possibly at a favourable rate.On Tuesday, when asked about the proposal, Zelenskyy told reporters Ukraine was open to “investment” from “partners who help us defend our land and push the enemy back with their weapons, their presence, and sanctions packages. And this is absolutely fair.”Zelenskyy said he had previously discussed the issue with Trump and that his teams were preparing for a visit by a US delegation.“Rare earths” refers to a group of 17 elements prized for their unique magnetic and electrochemical properties. They are used in many modern products, from smartphones to electric vehicle batteries to cancer treatment drugs.US-China trade: what are rare-earth metals and what’s the dispute?Read moreChina is by far the world’s largest producer of rare earths, accounting for about 70% of global production. The elements have beendesignated as criticalby the US Geological Survey for sectors including national defence, and Washington has sought to reduce its reliance on Beijing.Scholz criticised Trump’s transactional foreign policy, saying “it would be very selfish, very self-centred”. Germany is Ukraine’s second-largest military donor after the US.Such resources would be better used for Ukraine’s reconstruction after the war, Scholz said, speaking after a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Monday.The Kyiv Independentcited a sourcein Ukraine’s presidential office as saying that a deal over the country’s resources with allies was in fact first proposed in Zelenskyy’s “victory plan”, which includes a mix ofeconomic and security incentivesand demands of western allies.Zelenskyypresented the proposalto foreign leaders during the US presidential campaign, knowing that a Trump administration would add pressure on Kyiv to come to an agreement with Moscow.The plan offers deals on strategic mineral deposits in Ukraine that Zelenskyy said were worth trillions of dollars. Those included uranium, titanium, lithium and graphite, which are not rare earth metals, but also unnamed “other strategically valuable resources”.Moscow said on Tuesday that Trump’s desire for rare earth metals was a clear offer to Ukraine to buy US assistance. “It would be better of course for the assistance to not be provided at all, as that would contribute to the end of this conflict,” said the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov.Vladimir Putin launched afull-scale invasion of Ukrainein 2022.

Some conspiratorial narratives circling in Brussels even suggest thatChina is using green NGOsto influence EU policy with the connivance of the European Commission.The sum of money currently being discussed as part of the EU’sLIFE programmeis small – €15.6m (£12.9m) annually, orabout 0.006%of the commission’s annual budget – but it could deprive 30 NGOs of up to 70% of their annual incomes, according tothe most recent figures.Faustine Bas-Defossez, policy director for the large and well-established European Environmental Bureau, told the Guardian that even her group would “face a struggle” without the 10% of its funding it receives from LIFE.“This is a clear attempt to undermine democracy and stifle the voices of civil society,” she said. “Those driving these attacks and accusations are often the same actors pushing to dismantle key elements of the European Green Deal – despite overwhelming scientific evidence about the urgent need to accelerate the green transition.”Groups listed as receiving more than a quarter of their funding from the €5.4bn LIFE programme last year include: ClientEarth, Carbon Market Watch, the European Cyclists Federation, Health and Environment Alliance, Organics International, the Institute for European Environmental Policy, Pesticide Action Network Europe, the Surfrider Foundation, Wetlands International and WWF Central and Eastern Europe.Carlotta Besozzi, the director of Civil Society Europe, said: “Quite a few organisations could be at risk of being shut down if their funding from LIFE is cut off because there is simply not a huge availability of other funding sources.”EU funding for NGOs is intended to counterbalance the huge amounts spent on corporate lobbying – an estimated€1.7bn in 2023. But MEPs from the European People’s Party (EPP), European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and farright blocs in parliament allege that the commission’s environmental department has secretlypaid NGOs to lobby otherswithin the EU for more ambitious policies.Monika Hohlmeier, the vice-chair of parliament’s budgetary committee, said last month that this would “impinge on essential principles such as legislative independence, transparency, avoidance of conflicts of interest, fair and impartial distribution of funds and accountability for the proper use of taxpayers’ money”. She said that the commission should end “such scandalous one-sided methods in the future and ensure that misused money is repaid”.That money might date back as far as a decade ago, according to another EPP lawmaker, Tomáš Zdechovský. He insisted that there was no intent to shut down green groups.“We don’t want to liquidate any NGOs,” he said. “We only want transparency.” The EPP had pursued the issue because “we received information from whistleblowers that these NGOs have secret contracts from the commission to lobby MEPs,” he said.Zdechovský said that he was not able to share any evidence because the EPP’s sources were “under pressure from the commission or NGOs”. However, NGOs deny the existence of any such dubious contracts.Ariel Brunner, the director of Birdlife Europe, described the charge as “a slanderous witch-hunt that has no bearing in reality. It is obviously a very dangerous attack on the basic infrastructure of European democracy.”Chris Baker, the director of Wetlands International, said the money his group received from LIFE was “not guided in any way, shape or form by what DG Environment would like us to do”.A funding cut would “diminish our presence in Brussels but not end it,” he added.Martin Dermine, the director of Pesticide Action Network Europe, also denied any impropriety, adding that while his group had other revenue sources, an end to LIFE funding could “prevent us from being present in the Brussels arena”.Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Nicholas Aiossa, the director of Transparency International EU, accused the EPP of “taking a leaf out of [Hungarian PM] Viktor Orbán’s book” in its accusations against civil society groups.“There’s no question of misuse of EU funds in this conversation. There’s no indication or evidence at all that any rules have been broken, but despite that we’ve seen a committee going around requesting dozens of contracts from NGOs and civil society actors amounting to thousands of pages to carry out one of the biggest fishing expeditions I’ve ever seen.”Ironically, Hohlmeier herself reportedlyreceives €75,000 a yearfrom Baywa, a German agricultural trading company partly funded by LIFE. She declined to be interviewed.The defunding proposal is expected to wind its way through various parliamentary committees ahead of a plenary vote on the commission’s budgetary discharge, which is expected in May.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionEuropeEuropean CommissionGreen politicsGreenhouse gas emissionsClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

In one clip, he points at a distinctive rusty orange duck among the bodies of half a dozen waterfowl.“This is actually a rather uncommon duck for the area,” he says. “Not even sure what it is in English, but incredible shoot.”The ruddy shelduck, known in India as the Brahminy duck, is a migratory bird that winters in south Asia and breeds in south-east Europe. Its global conservation status is not under threat but environmentalists have raised concerns about its future as climate breakdownshifts its breeding range.Zanoni said killing the protected bird was a crime and questioned Trump Jr’s right to hunt inItalyas a non-resident.Massimo Buconi, the president of the Italian Hunting Federation, pushed back on the claim that foreigners were not able to hunt in Italy but said the law would have indeed been broken if the bird in the video was confirmed as a ruddy shelduck.“At a glance it looks like a ruddy shelduck,” he said. “I don’t know if it’s protected in America, but in Europe, and in Italy, it is protected. You cannot hunt it.”Zanoni said the video appeared to have been filmed in the Pierimpie’ valley near Venice, in a special conservation area. He said he had asked the regional authority “what sanctions it intends to impose” on the parties involved, such as suspending or revoking the licence of the company that authorised the hunt.A Green member of the national parliament, Luana Zanella, has escalated the matter to the environment ministry.Neither Zanoni nor Trump Jr immediately responded to a request for comment from AFP.Field Ethos did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian. The voiceover of the video said the trip took place on private land and that it took measures to respect the local environment.Trump Jr visited Venice in December with his girlfriend, according to Italian media reports. The 48-year-old is an avid trophy hunter. In 2020 he was granted apermitto hunt an Alaskan grizzly bear. Earlier that year a week-long “dream hunt” with Trump Jr had beenauctionedat a trophy hunting convention in Nevada.The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, was among Europe’s far-right leaders who attended theinaugurationof Trump Jr’s father. The Italian leader had visited Trump Sr’s Mar-a-Lago golf club in Florida earlier that month, during which Trump described her as “a fantastic woman” who is “really taking Europe by storm”.Zanoni said: “The current Meloni government now seems to be kept on a leash by the new US political direction.”Explore more on these topicsItalyDonald Trump JrEuropeBirdsWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

Gaza is not a place for people to be living, and the only reason they want to go back, and I believe this strongly, is because they have no alternative… If they had an alternative, they’d much rather not go back to Gaza and live in a beautiful alternative that’s safe,” he told reporters in the Oval Office.“If we could find the right piece of land, or numerous pieces of land, and build them some really nice places with plenty of money in the area, that’s for sure. I think that would be a lot better than going back to Gaza,” he said.When asked where such places might be, he suggested they could be in Jordan, Egypt or “other places. You could have more than two.“You’d have people living in a place that could be very beautiful, and safe and nice. Gaza’s been a disaster for decades.”Asked about the reaction of Palestinian and other Arab leaders to his proposal, Trump said: “I don’t know how they could want to stay.”Sitting alongside Netanyahu, Trump was questioned by reporters whether Palestinians would have the right to return to Gaza if they left while the rebuilding was happening. The president replied: “It would be my hope that we could do something really nice, really good, where they wouldn’t want to return. Why would they want to return?”A seniorHamasofficial dismissed the suggestion as a “a recipe for creating chaos and tension in the region.”Sami Abu Zuhri said in a statement: “Our people in the Gaza Strip will not allow these plans to pass. What is required is an end to the occupation and aggression against our people, not their expulsion from their land.”There was also criticism from Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian envoy to the UN. He said: “Our homeland is our homeland, if part of it is destroyed, the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian people selected the choice to return to it. And I think that leaders and people should respect he wishes of the Palestinian people.”Trump confirmed he was withdrawing the US from the United Nations human rights council and prohibiting future funding for the main UN agency serving Palestinians in the occupied territories.The US president also signed a memorandum reimposing his “maximum pressure” policy of sanctions on Iran including efforts to “drive its oil exports down to zero” in order to stop Tehran from obtaining nuclear weapons.As he signed the memo, Trump said he was open to a deal with Iran and expressed a willingness to talk to the Iranian leader.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Asked how close Tehran is to a weapon, Trump said: “They’re too close.”The comments came ahead of a meeting with Netanyahu, who is making is first visit to Washington since the international criminal court issued a warrant for his arrest.Netanyahu andTrumpare expected to discuss the fragile hostages-for-ceasefire deal as Israel and Hamas are supposed to begin a second phase of the negotiations that could lead to a permanent truce and the return of dozens more Israelis held hostage byHamasin exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.Trump’s meeting with Netanyahu will be his first with a foreign leader since his inauguration, a sign of respect (despite the two leaders having atroubled relationship in the past) that also reflects the urgency of a ceasefire that Trump told reporters on Monday he had “no guarantees” would hold.Shortly before the summit began, Hamas said that the second round of ceasefire talks had begun as stipulated in the deal signed last month.Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Netanyahu ahead of the summit. Witkoff is said to have been instrumental in pushing the Israeli leader to agree to the ceasefire last month, even as Netanyahu’s ultra-rightwing allies threatened to leave the ruling coalition for taking too soft a line on Hamas.‘My memories are crushed and buried’: a long walk home in GazaRead moreIn the US administration, Trump’s advisers are split among openly pro-settler hardliners such as Mike Huckabee, defense hawks such as the national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and more pragmatic dealmakers such as Witkoff who are seeking to keep the shaky ceasefire on track, said Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, a liberal pro-Israel group.“It’s a really mixed set of influences and interests that are impacting Trump, and it all has to sort of sort itself out relatively quickly, because if this ceasefire falls apart, you know, this is really, really bad, and there’s no hope of getting back from that,” he said. “This really is an inflection point, and a lot hinges on how this set of meetings go and what direction Trump pushes it in.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahuWashington DCInternational criminal courtInternational criminal justiceIsraelHamasnewsShareReuse this content"

Russia, China and the Iranian private sector are all urging Tehran to take the steps that would end the blacklisting. But conservatives and the security establishment are resisting, saying such moves would expose Iran’s financial workings, including the funding of groups such as Hezbollah. The transparency would also allow the west to target sanctions against Iran more effectively.The controversy about FATF has been simmering for years. Few in Iran pretend this is merely a technical discussion, but instead part of a broader geostrategic discussion about the price of reducing Iran’s isolation. More than 90% of Iran’s total exports (oil and other products) are sent to just 10 countries.The issue has suddenly been placed in front of the Expediency Discernment Council, a 48-strong body selected by the supreme leader and broadly representative of the establishment. Its task is to mediate in disputes between parliament and the Guardian Council, a constitutional watchdog.Ending the blacklisting would allow Iranian banking and private firms to join the international banking system, and open foreign bank accounts, removing one of the main obstacles to foreign trade. The central bank and the chambers of commerce are calling for an end to the isolation, even though many western sanctions linked to the nuclear deal would remain.The two preconditions for being removed from the blacklist are joining the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) and the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (Palermo Convention). The Guardian Council has rejected two bills passed by the Iranian parliament in 2018 that would allow the country to join the two conventions.On Sunday, the Iranian parliament speaker, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, staged a closed session of the parliament to discuss the move, saying this would allow parliament’s latest views to be taken into account by the Expediency Council. Iranian media said the lengthy discussion revealed deep division but many MPs, under constituency pressure over the dire state of the economy, called for Iran to take the plunge.The Expediency Council, after some reluctance last month, started examining the two bills passed by the parliament line by line.The intelligence ministry says the move has downsides, including restricting Iran’s ability to get around economic sanctions and help finance resistance groups such as Hezbollah. Making state finances more transparent could increase the efficiency of economic sanctions, subjecting Iran to a body that some in the country see as inherently western oriented.The rearguard opposition being shown by Iran’s conservatives means the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, and the president, Masoud Pezeshkian, would have to intervene decisively with the Expediency Council to join the conventions. Pezeshkian made ending the country’s economic isolation a central theme of his election campaign, but the supreme leader has often suggested the country can thrive without cooperation with the west.Ali Ghanbari, an economist, has said vested interests that oppose moves to get off the blacklist are from people benefiting from corruption and secret funding, and claims that oil sales would be hindered are unfounded.“The claim that some individuals makethat it will be impossible for us to sell oil, is an incorrect justification, because the whole world knows who our oil buyers are,” he said.The deputy minister of intelligence, Hossein Safdari, said: “Negotiation is not mandatory to reach an understanding. Those who think they can reach a conclusion at the negotiating table with the Americans either do not understand politics or are not familiar with the literature of negotiation.”Javad Zarif, the vice-president for strategy, said: “Screaming does not require courage, but agreeing does. Consensus and thinking about national interests requires courage.”Explore more on these topicsIranGlobal economyAyatollah Ali KhameneiEconomicsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

So what we’re saying is we need this massive increase in the budget to £2.65bn.”Damaging storms in recent years had also affected the quality of flood defence schemes, the government said, leaving many in need of urgent repair. Others needed an upgrade because they were built when the impact of the climate crisis was not as well known.A total of 31 new projects are being given the green light, while £36m is being spent in 2025 to undertake urgent repairs to defences damaged during extreme flooding events.Announcing the new funding, the government stated: “As well as protecting families from the devastation of flooding, the investment supports economic growth by protecting businesses, supporting jobs, and supporting a stable economy in the face of the increasing risk of flooding as a result of climate change.“It will also protect farmland which has been badly hit by recent storms, in turn helping to safeguard farm businesses and farmers’ profits.”Farmers affected by severe weather between October 2023 and March 2024 have been compensated to the tune of more than £57m, Defra has reported. The farming recovery fund has supported 12,700 businesses to cover the cost of restoring their farmland.With climate breakdown contributing to more extremes in weather and more frequent flooding, more homes and businesses are expected to be flooded in the coming years.View image in fullscreenEmma Hardy at Castlehill Aquagreen in Bransholme, Hull, which is designed to store excess water during a flood.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianWhen asked about whether it was possible to simply not build homes in areas at risk of flooding, Hardy, who previously worked in a school that was badly flooded, said that would mean cities such as Hull would not be able to build anything at all.She suggested: “If we can not build on a flood plain then obviously that’s best. But there are ways of building that mean homes are not at risk of increased flooding and, more importantly, don’t increase the risk of flooding elsewhere.”While the money was largely not earmarked for flood prevention schemes at the source, such as upland restoration, Hardy said the government was also looking at reviewing how the “flood formula” was calculated, which is used to allocate money based on the number of properties that would be protected.This would mean schemes that have a wider good, such as natural flood management, would be more readily funded.“It’s quite difficult with natural flood management to come up with a hard-edged calculation on how many properties are protected,” she said.The shadow environment secretary, Victoria Atkins, said: “In government, the Conservatives invested record amounts of money in flood defences and coastal erosion. To say otherwise is wholly untrue.“Steve Reed has not told us where this latest money has come from, whether it is in fact a repackaging of money invested by a Conservative government, or how he intends to offer tailored support to frequently flooded communities.”Explore more on these topicsFloodingLabourClimate crisisHullnewsShareReuse this content"

I don’t know if or how her own mental health was assessed. But the day after, her messages were quite distressed. And two days later, she took her own life.”Kyrke-Smith said she hoped that, after the debate, she could examine whether there were any improvements that could be made to the mental health bill, which is now in the House of Lords. Suicide is the leading cause of maternal death in the period from six weeks to a year after birth.Kyrke-Smith said that her surprise election victory – her majority is 630 – had made her determined to make an impact on the subject.“Since losing Sophie, I have become aware of how prevalent maternal mental health challenges are, but how little attention they get compared with the physical challenges of pregnancy, birth and that first year after birth,” she said.“I knew that I wanted to change this if I was elected to parliament. I want to do right by Sophie and I want to make sure that other women get the support they need and deserve.”Kyrke-Smith will say in her speech that improvements have been made in recent years, including an increase in specialist perinatal mental health services for women with the most severe and complex issues across England. But, she said, care remained “a postcode lottery” with disadvantaged women more likely to miss out.“I wonder if any healthcare professionals asked Sophie not just how the baby was, but how she was,” Kyrke-Smith will say in her speech.“I wonder if the discussions about her baby’s feeding were had in a way that sought to reduce her anxiety.“I wonder if she was given less attention because this was her third child, and her earlier experiences had been smoother – I certainly experienced less attention with my own third child. I will never know.”The MP said she was calling for aprotection of specialist maternal care in severe cases as part of theNHSfive-year plan on mental health, and better integration of mental health care into all routine contact during pregnancy and after birth, with mental health prioritised in the same way as physical health.She will say there should be a renewed focus on community support, saying she believed that the Covid-19 pandemic contributed to her friend’s feeling of isolation, and that there should be a mission to help friends and families build awareness to help mothers who are struggling.“Did I worry about her being depressed? Yes. Did I worry about suicidal thoughts? Honestly, yes. Did I think she might take her own life? No. I have struggled with the guilt that I didn’t somehow do something to stop it. But I also recognise now how ignorant I was.”The care minister, Stephen Kinnock, was expected to respond to the debate, which Kyrke-Smith said was oversubscribed with MPs hoping to speak.Kyrke-Smith is being supported by the Alliance for Maternal MentalHealth. “Too often, mental health support is seen as an added luxury rather than an integral part of maternity care. This must change,” campaigns head, Karen Middleton, said. “Maternal mental health problems are treatable, and the right support can be life-changing, even life-saving.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

The company reported $96.5bn, compared with analyst expectations of $96.67 bn.The company surpassed investors’ expectations of $2.13 in earnings per share, however, with $2.15 in EPS.“Q4 was a strong quarter driven by our leadership in AI and momentum across the business,” Alphabet chief executive Sundar Pichai wrote in a statement. “We are building, testing, and launching products and models faster than ever, and making significant progress in compute and driving efficiencies.”The company reported $84bn in its services revenue, which includesGooglesearch and YouTube ads and $12bn in Cloud revenues, a 30% increase year over year.As competition heats up in various sectors of Alphabet’s business, analysts will be looking for more details about a wide range of topics including the company’s AI spending, its Cloud revenue, and its ability to continue to bolster its search advantage against new and existing generative AI players such as China’sDeepSeekand OpenAI.The company’s revenue slowdown reflects the “challenging year” Google has had and 2025 might be the year that it loses its competitive edge, according toEmarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf.“Although it’s still well insulated, Google’s advantages in search hinge on its ubiquity and entrenched consumer behavior,” Mitchell-Wolf said in a statement. This year “could be the year those advantages meaningfully erode as antitrust enforcement and open source AI models change the game. And Cloud’s disappointing results suggest that AI-powered momentum might be beginning to wane just as Google’s closed model strategy is called into question by DeepSeek.”Alphabet also said it plans to spend $75bn on capital expenditures in the next year, largely to build out its artificial intelligence capabilities and infrastructure.“Our results show the power of our differentiated full-stack approach to AI innovation and the continued strength of our core businesses,” Pichai wrote. “We are confident about the opportunities ahead, and to accelerate our progress, we expect to invest approximately $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2025.”Spending on building out AI infrastructure and development has continued to rise across the industry, and Alphabet is expected to be no exception. Meta said it planned to spend $65bn on AI infrastructure just in 2025. That’s partly why news of Deepseek’s AI model, which the company said they trained with just $5.6m, sparked investor panic in the US and erased $1tn from the stock market. But research firm SemiAnalysisnow estimates that DeepSeekactually spent a total of almost $1.3bn. Analysts will be looking to hear how this has impacted the way Alphabet look at its own spending and monetizing its AI search features.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

(Tech giants say yes)Read more“It will be interesting how the rising costs of AI impact Alphabet’s roadmap for AI-integrated advertising, especially in light of DeepSeek’s revelation that they may have wasted tremendous money and energy,” saidNikhil Lai, senior analystat Forrester.The company appears to also be opening the door to develop AI for more use cases, including for national security. Moments before the company reported its earnings, the company also removed its pledge not to use its AI technology for weapons, surveillance and technology that can “cause or are likely to cause overall harm”. In a blog post, Google’s head of AI, Demis Hassabis, and the company’s senior vice-president for technology and society, James Manyika,wrotethat as global competition for AI leadership increases, the company believes “democracies should lead in AI development” which are guided by “freedom, equality, and respect for human rights”.“And we believe that companies, governments, and organizations sharing these values should work together to create AI that protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security.”Analysts will also likely have questions about the Department of Justice case against the search giant, in which the tech giant suffered landmark loss. A judge found the company maintained a monopoly in general search and text advertising services. The justice department has suggested breaking up the company as a means to remedy this.China has also set its sights on Google. After the Trump administration announced it was imposing tariffs on China, Chinarespondedby announcing a range of measures including a new inquiry into whether Google violated the country’s anti-monopoly law.Explore more on these topicsAlphabetGoogleArtificial intelligence (AI)ChinaDeepSeekOpenAITrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Officials said their work might depend upon the wind and tidal conditions in the river, where the plane and helicopter crashed last Wednesday night after colliding as the plane was about to land at nearby Ronald Reagan National airport, killing everyone onboard both aircraft.‘Stomach-turning’: Democrats condemn Trump’s DEI claims after Washington plane crashRead moreThroughout the day, crews could be seen lifting large pieces of the plane from the river. The National Transportation Safety Board said it did not plan to provide further updates from the scene.Authorities said early on in the effort that they had expected to recover the remains of everyone who died. They are focusing first on the jet and hope to recover the Black Hawk helicopter later this week.Col Francis B Pera of the army corps of engineers said salvage crews on Monday were able to pull one of the two jet engines from the river, along with large pieces of the plane’s exterior. They were also working to recover a wing of the plane, which had flown out of Wichita, Kansas.Sixty passengers and four crew were on the American Airlines flight, including figure skaters returning from the 2025 US Figure Skating Championships in Wichita.The Black Hawk was on a training mission. Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; Capt Rebecca M Lobach, of Durham, North Carolina, were onboard.Federal investigators are trying to piece together the events that led to the collision. Full investigations typically take a year or more, but investigators hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days.Wednesday’s crash was the deadliest in the US since 12 November 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people onboard and five on the ground.Explore more on these topicsWashington DC plane crashWashington DCPlane crashesnewsShareReuse this content"

China’s finance ministry also announced 15% tariffs on coal and liquefied natural gas, and 10% on crude oil, farm equipment, large-displacement vehicles and pickup trucks from the US.China’s commerce ministry and its customs administration said on Tuesday that to “safeguard national security interests” the country was imposing export controls on a raft of critical minerals: tungsten, tellurium, ruthenium, molybdenum and ruthenium-related items.The commerce ministry also said it was adding the US companies PVH Group and Illumina Inc to its unreliable entity list, opening them to restrictions or penalties, without detailing what the companies were accused of. PVH is a clothing company that owns brands including Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein. Illumina is a biotech company specialising in genomic sequencing that recently partnered with Nvidia on health-related AI tech.In December, China launched an antitrust investigation into Nvidia, after a tightening of US export controls on hi-tech products popular in China. On Tuesday, the Financial Times reported that Beijing was considering adding US chipmaker Intel to the list of companies being investigated by China’s antitrust regulator. China is Intel’s largest market, and Nvidia’s second-largest after the US.Trump tariffs: which countries are affected and what does this mean?Read moreMost of Google’s services such as search and email are blocked in China. But the company still makes money in China from Chinese companies advertising overseas and from Chinese phone-makers using its Android operating system.“The unilateral imposition of tariffs by the US seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization,” China’s finance ministry said in its statement announcing the retaliatory tariffs. “It is not only unhelpful in solving its own problems, but also damages the normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the US.”Earlier, the US presidentpulled backfrom the brink of an economic conflict with Canada and Mexico, however, delaying threatened duties for another month after 11th-hour talks.For exports from China, the US has scrapped an exemption through which shipments valued at less than $800 (£644) have not faced tariffs. Popular Chinese retailers such as Shein and Temu have relied on the exemption to sell cheap goods in the US.China trade surplus chartAfter a call with Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, on Monday, Trump agreed to postpone tariffs of 25% onMexico– the latest of several delays – after she offered to send 10,000 of the country’s troops to its border with the US.Talks with Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, also prompted Trump to postpone 25% tariffs on the country.Canadais implementing a $1.3bn border plan, Trudeau said, and will appoint a fentanyl tsar, list cartels as a terrorists and “ensure 24/7 eyes on the border”.As the US readied higher tariffs on China on Monday, the White House announced that Trump would speak later this week with China’s president, Xi Jinping. Beijing earlier pledged to hit back with “countermeasures” and file a legal case against the US at the World Trade Organization.Economists have warned Trump’s tariff plans risk raising prices for millions of Americans, only weeks after he pledged, upon taking office, to “rapidly” bring them down.Addressing reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump maintained that tariffs were a “very powerful” means of strengthening the US economically and “getting everything else you want”.Every country wanted to agree a way to avoid US tariffs, the president claimed. “In all cases, they all wanna make deals.”Trump had conceded over the weekend that they could cause “a little pain” in the US. “WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!),” he wrote on social media. “BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.”The reaction in global financial markets, which had recovered some of their losses on Monday after Trump’s one-month delay, was mixed on Tuesday.In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng share index jumped by almost 2.8%, while South Korea’s Kospi rose by 1.3%. The FTSE 100 fell 31 points to 8,551 shortly after opening in London.Sterling dropped by half a cent against the US dollar to $1.24, while the euro was down a similar amount at $1.03.The Canadian dollar, which slumped to a 20-year low on Monday before rebounding, weakened – to 1.445 to the dollar.Chinese markets remain closed because of the lunar new year holiday and will reopen on Wednesday.Additional reporting by Graeme WeardenExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpChinaUS economyUS politicsMexicoCanadaEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Quite frankly, who’s the president right now? Who’s actually running the show?”Since taking over the office of personnel management, Musk’s team has alsogained accessto the US treasury payments system and has claimed Trump has agreed with him in efforts to shut down the United States Agency for International Development (USAid), the independent federal agency responsible for administering foreign aid and development assistance.“It’s been madness,” said an employee at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) headquarters in Washington who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation.“Musk sends these from this sketchy email they set up days ago, almost always after 8pm. They seem clearly designed to disturb and scare people, among all of the things they actually say, which are clear threats,” they added.They provided copies of emails from the office of personnel management and the newly appointed EEOC chair, including an email offering resignation buyouts; an email affirming the ending of any programs or contracts associated with diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA); and a request for workers to report any allegations of programs or contracts with “DEIA or similar ideologies” within 10 days or face “adverse consequences”.“Our agency is being forced to comply with the DEI EO [executive order] in direct violation of federal law, namely title VII/Bostock, and there have been no inter- complaints nor processing of said complaints because everyone is terrified of retaliation/immediate firing/mass reduction in force,” the worker said.In 2020, the supreme courtruledin the Bostock case that title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.The worker also criticized Trump’s appointee for acting chair of the EEOC, Andrea Lucas, and her commentscriticizinggender identity policies. They also said individuals responsible for anything related to DEI have had their duties completely reassigned or are in the process of being rewritten.As EEOC investigations are still proceeding, the employee expressed concern that findings or litigation recommendations will be halted by the acting chair and commissioners appointed by Trump.“There are now no employee work groups, such as a Black employees’ organization, a Hispanic organization, or a pride organization – all special emphasis programs and training have ceased, down to even book clubs [being] banned,” they said. “The EEOC has always pursued reverse racism and sexism claims, but I assume those will be the primary sources of agency litigation.”The EEOC would not comment.The office of personnel management hascontinuedpushing a voluntary resignation program, urging civil service workers to quit, while unions havefiledlawsuits against Trump’s executive order toreclassifycivil service workers as political appointees under schedule policy/career positions.“Civil service protections keep the government honest, fair, transparent, accountable, and allow civil service employees to report fraud, waste, abuse, illegal activities and unethical activities. Once that is gone and they can no longer defend themselves or report illegal activity, you have full corruption of the executive branch,” said Steve Lenkart, executive director of the National Federation of Federal Employees, whichrepresentsaround 110,000 federal workers in various agencies.“The mood right now is one of fear and anxiety,” he added. “The fear that the executive branch is going to be taken over by very corrupt people and ask them to do very corrupt things. The general thought of these people are: they’re morons, they’re here for political reasons. They’re completely underqualified, don’t understand the government, and they certainly don’t care about the law and regulations – they are looking to evade all those.”In addition to the pushes for voluntary resignations from the office of personnel management to reduce the federal workforce, and different agenciesplacingemployees whose job duties involved DEI work on leave,more than 220,000 employeeswho work as probationary or trial-period employees with fewer civil service protections are fearful of being laid off en masse, though they are only supposed to be laid off for poor performance.These workers are employed at various agencies in the federal government, withabout 25%at the Veterans Health Administration.“I am concerned we will all be mass fired,” said an employee at the US Department of Transportation who is on a probationary term appointment. “Teams would be hobbled and gutted. It would be like closing your eyes and randomly throwing acid on a flower garden. You would just have dead spots, and no planning for which ones.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsDonald TrumpElon MuskUS politicsUS unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was mostly a joke, but she has friends who made one final Temu run. “My friend Piper got a ton of apartment stuff during a last-minute tariff haul,” she said.View image in fullscreenVivi Armacost has friends who made a final Temu run.Photograph: Tiktok user @viviarmacostTemu – which surpassed Amazon as the most-downloaded shopping app in 2023 – andSheinare beloved by both the overly trendy and the obsessively thrifty. While Shein is known primarily for clothing, Temu also sells makeup, home goods and decor. These products are cheap – just over $4 for a pair of women’s sneakers on Temu, or $1.45 for bracelet on Temu – but of dubious quality. Inevitably, many end up in landfills.“A lot of the stuff comes actually way smaller than you expect,” Armacost said. “I bought a desk lamp, except it can fit in my hands.”In the months before Trump took office, shoppers urged each other to stock up on Temu and Shein, in case the new administration followed through on its promise to tax US trade partners. “Kinda feeling emo bc this may be the last good Black Friday for a while because of the tariffs,” one TikTok user wrote in aclip. “Better collect your ‘vintage Shein’ because they will probably go for $100 next year.’”Two days after the election, the fashion writer Amy Odellwarned readersof price hikes in a post to her BackRow Substack titled: “Trump Won. So Shop Now.” Susan Scafidi, a lawyer and founder of Fordham’s Fashion Law Institute, told Odell: “Everything’s going to be more expensive, which is a little crazy when you realize that a lot of the Trump appeal was with regard to the economy.”Could the tariff kill fast fashion, an industry defined by wasteful over-consumption, as we know it? No, says Margaret Bishop, a textile and apparel specialist and professor at New York’s Parsons School of Design and the Fashion Institute of Technology. “If anything, I think these tariffs will strengthen fast fashion’s hold on customers,” she said. “If everything costs more, particularly food, transportation and housing, they’re going to have to cut back somewhere.“Americans have a real hunger for new fashion, so they will trade down to be able to continue to buy things. If a $1 pack of T-shirts at Temu becomes $2 a pack, that’s still cheaper than spending $20 for a couple of T-shirts that are better made,” she continued.Sheng Lu, a professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware, agreed that tariffs would not “fundamentally shift” Americans’ love of a good, if sketchy, deal. While small businesses will bear most of the pain from tariffs – due to supply chain snarls or the fact that Americans won’t be able to spend as much – larger corporations such as Shein and Temu tend to absorb costs.“These companies are resourceful,” Lu said. “My more immediate concern is that small and medium-sized enterprises won’t survive, or will face significant challenges.”Big tech to tungsten: what industries are the focus of China’s new US tariffs?Read moreIn 2023, a US congressionalreportalleged that there was an “extremely high risk” that Temu used forced labor in its supply chain, and that both Shein and Temu evaded US human rights reviews. (Shein denied these claims at the time, while Temu did not comment on the report.) A recentreportfrom the Swiss advocacy group Public Eye found that some Shein workers endure 75-hour work weeks. (Shein told the BBC it was “working hard” to address the issues raised in the report.)The fast-fashion industry is alsosynonymouswith high carbon emissions and pollution.Lu fears that tariffs will exacerbate these issues. “If they have to pay more on tariff duties but at the same time make their prices competitive, that’s not good news for workers or the environmental impact, because companies will have more incentive to cut corners,” he said.Armacost knows that these e-commerce giants represent the worst of Americans’ desire for excess. “But also, at the same time, spendingdoesstimulate the economy,” she said. “In response to the idea that it’s a good thing if people stop ordering so much random stuff, I say: ‘What’s the point of living in a country if I can’t order 100 pieces of junk for $15?’”Explore more on these topicsE-commerceDonald TrumpChinaSheinfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As I wrotelast year’s wrap, there had already been major big-money sales – $10m for A Real Pain, $17m for It’s What’s Inside, $15m for My Old Ass, $5m for Presence – some smaller ones – Thelma, Ghostlight, Ibelin, Daughters, Skywalkers and Kneecap – and in the 48 hours after there were even more – Dìdi to Focus and Will & Harper to Netflix. Post-strikes it was a reassuringly robust marketplace with gaps that needed to be filled but just a year later, things are looking far less comforting.Together review – codependent relationship body horror is a fun rideRead moreThere were even more questions over quality – I heard many a grumble in the press line over a lack of breakouts – but even so, as of writing, there have been only four deals confirmed, a worryingly dour result for what’s seen as one of America’s most important markets. Films with sellable names like Jennifer Lopez, Olivia Colman,Benedict Cumberbatchand Josh O’Connor and some of the best-reviewed titles remain without distribution.A sense of cautiousness might explain why the most immediately competitive title was a horror film, still one of the only close-to-sure genres in Hollywood. That film wasTogether, a slickly made body horror picked up by Neon for a reported $17m, after fighting off competition from A24. It stars the real-life husband-and-wife duo Alison Brie and Dave Franco as a codependent couple who find themselves drawn to each other even more when they stumble upon a gnarly infection that forces their flesh together. While it would have been an easy yes in any year, we are now living in a post-Substance world, the Demi Moore-fronted sleeper scoring both strong box office and surprise Oscar nominations. While Together is unlikely to be an awards darling, a swiftly announced August release date should make it a solid late summer hit.View image in fullscreenSorry, Baby’s Lucas Hedges, Eva Victor and Naomi Ackie.Photograph: George Pimentel/REX/Shutterstock for Sundance Film FestivalThe film was also one of the most universally liked of the festival (it’s maintained a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes), a distinction also shared by another buzzy sale, albeit on a far smaller scale. The comedian Eva Victor’s debutSorry, Babyhad already seemed like a perfect fit for A24 before it even showed interest – it’s produced by Barry Jenkins, who has a relationship with the company after Moonlight and Aftersun, it’s a writer-director-actor showcase of someone known for their poppy virality and it’s an unusual #MeToo narrative loosely similar to I May Destroy You. It was an $8m pickup for the distributor who will probably give it a low-key awards push later in the year. The Oscar conversation will also likely include another big sale of the festival, the period dramaTrain Dreamswhich was bought by Netflix for a figure that’sreportedlyin the high teen millions. The film stars Joel Edgerton and the recent two-time Oscar nominee Felicity Jones as a couple at the start of the 20th century living in the American west and boasts the same creative team as Sing Sing. Across the board praise for Edgerton should see him become a strong best actor contender.A rather less surefire best actress contender also emerged in the first weekend in the unlikely shape ofIf I Had Legs I’d Kick You, a anxiety-fueled dark comedy about motherhood with a career-best performance from a remarkable Rose Byrne. The film, from the writer-director Mary Bronstein, already has A24 behind it, but it’s a divisive, deliberately difficult watch that could prove too alienating for many voters.View image in fullscreenTwinless stars James Sweeney and Dylan O’Brien.Photograph: Jay L Clendenin/REX/ShutterstockThe festival kicked off with two narrative features that landed at opposite ends of the spectrum. The director Sophie Hyde, who’d scored Sundance success with 52 Tuesdays, Animals and the Emma Thompson-fronted Good Luck to You, Leo Grande, stumbled with her latest, the personal dramaJimpa. Despite strong performances from Olivia Colman and John Lithgow, the film struggled to impress critics on the ground and will be a tough one to sell. But then later that night, the Straight Up writer-director-actor James Sweeney found himself the talk of the town after his second feature, the wonderfully indefinableTwinless, premiered to rave reviews. A twisty, genre-shifting mix of grief drama, Hitchcock thriller and dark comedy, it’s perhaps the film’s unusual nature that’s left it unsold at this stage given how strong the response has been (another 100% rating that also picked up the audience award). The film drew controversy at the tail-end of the festival after leaks led to it being pulled from the digital platform that allows for consumers to rent certain titles. Sex scenes including its star Dylan O’Brien (who gave one of the festival’s most impressive breakout performances) plus major plot reveals were shared on social media, the second film (after a doc about the tragic singer Selena Quintanilla) to be leaked and then pulled.The app had been introduced as an inevitable addition during Covid times so journalists could cover the festival remotely but given how it became a strong money-maker for the festival (a reported half a million people used the portal in 2021) it stayed ever since. But with the leaks, especially as many of the films available are seeking buyers, questions remain over whether it will return next year at least in the current iteration.View image in fullscreenJennifer Lopez.Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/APMany more high-profile films chose to steer clear of the app, which was perhaps wisest forKiss of the Spider Woman, a Jennifer Lopez-led musical restaging of the prison-set queer drama. The Broadway adaptation’s many splashy technicolor setpieces would have surely landed online within minutes but while Lopez, who responded tearfully to a standing ovation, received praise for her singing and dancing, the film was met with mostly mixed reviews. It’s a tough proposition for many buyers even with the musical resurgence (Wicked, it ain’t) although I could see a smart distributor position it for a Lopez Golden Globe nod.An even tougher sell, with even rougher reviews, was led by another of the festival’s bigger stars, the Benedict Cumberbatch-fronted and Film 4-funded grief horror-dramaThe Thing With Feathers. Based on the much-loved novella, the film couldn’t capitalise on a packed-out Saturday night premiere, reminding too many of previous Sundance hit The Babadook. The night before also saw Cumberbatch’s Henry Sugar co-star Dev Patel receive similarly spotty reviews for the Wales-set folk horrorRabbit Trap, yet they were fawning in comparison to those that met Brit Himesh Patel’s comedy Bubble & Squeak, a cabbage-smuggling comedy that was widely viewed as the worst of the fest. Another well-known British actor who had more success was Ben Whishaw, who came with his second film under the Passages director Ira Sachs, the talky two-hander Peter Hujar’s Day. It had a warm reception but given how much smaller it is than their last film together (it’s essentially a 76-minute art film), it sold to a much smaller distributor in Sideshow and Janus Films.View image in fullscreenLurker writer-director Alex Russell and stars Théodore Pellerin, Archie Madekwe and Havana Rose Liu.Photograph: George Pimentel/REX/Shutterstock for Sundance Film FestivalMany of the buzzier titles, like the aforementioned Sorry, Baby and Twinless, managed to attract attention without such stars attached and with less attention-demanding premiere slots. On Tuesday evening, even as many critics had already left, the celebrity culture thrillerLurkerquickly became one of the festival’s most enthusiastically received titles, the first-time writer-director Alex Russell’s dark tale of a retail worker attaching himself to a musician feeling like one of the easier commercial sells of the festival. It was a genre hit unlike the disastrously receivedOpus, another story set in the music industry that was a rare A24 miss, a film that most people were quick to criticise on the ground.For while some films did attract applause, it was mostly of the polite kind. There was no Get Out or Past Lives or Little Miss Sunshine this year, at least not on the narrative side of things. The delayed Oscar nominations landed just as the festival was kicking off and while the best picture 10 was lacking a Sundance premiere (A Real Pain just missed out), the documentary category featured four of them. It was a fitting kick-off for a festival that was widely viewed as more impressive for docs again with standouts including films onhorrendous conditions in an Alabama prison,the troubled history of To Catch a Predator,the loves and life of Jeff Buckley,the rise of anti-trans rhetoric,the Russia-Ukraine war through the eyes of those fighting it,bigoted book bans in Americaanda Russian teacher dealing with life under Putin. But it’s been similarly dismal commercially without any sold to date, a potentially concerning sign of wider fears over content that might be deemed too controversial under a rightwing president.In 2023, two major docs, Union and No Other Land, ended up without any distribution with many speculating that their themes – the first on Amazon’s many labor issues and the second on Israeli violence and occupation in the West Bank – frightened buyers. While the latter still scored an Oscar nomination despite its lack of formal release, this years festival taking place just days after the inauguration added an unmistakable layer of caution to an already caution-heavy marketplace, a feeling that taking any added commercial or political risk is going to be even harder at such a volatile time.Explore more on these topicsSundance 2025Sundance film festivalFilm industryFestivalsDocumentary filmsJennifer LopezBenedict CumberbatchfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity.Among the allegations are that he seriously sexually assaulted and harassed several women in the mid and late 1990s when they worked for NM Rothschild.De Rothschild had a reputation for being autocratic and feared, with one source describing him as “totalitarian”. He was a financial adviser to the late Queen Elizabeth, whom he accompanied to Royal Ascot races, and was knighted in 1989.Although historical, their claims are likely to raise questions about the working culture experiencedby women within the Rothschild banking empire, which comprises a complex range of wealth advisory and investment banking services.De Rothschild, who died aged 91, was chair of NM Rothschild for more than 20 years and also served on the boards of the Economist and the parent company of the Daily Telegraph. A scion of one of the most famous dynasties in global banking, he spent 44 years working within Rothschild family businesses.According to sources who spoke to the Guardian, he used his office within NM Rothschild, a stone’s throw from the Bank of England in the City of London,to force himself upon women over several years.More than eight sources, some with direct experience of events, described incidents dating from the mid and late 1990s. However, multiple sources claimed that this kind of misconduct by De Rothschild went unchecked for decades.Do you have information about this story?

For the most secure communications use SecureDrop or see our guide.Sources alleged that he would “take his pick” of junior staff at the bank and shower them with attention before behaving inappropriately towards them. Their accounts described incidents in the financial group’s old London offices, partly now demolished and rebuilt on St Swithin’s Lane, the site first occupied by the bank in 1809.The claims include serious sexual assaults. One included a violent assault of a member of staff when she was a young woman working for him. Another allegation is that he put his hands down a different woman’s top and under her underwear to grope her. And a third woman claimed she was forced to perform a sex act on him while he sat on his desk.These allegations, dating to the mid and late 1990s, were put to lawyers acting for Rothschild & Co, the group that succeeded NM Rothschild. The allegations were also put to the Rothschild family via the same lawyers. The Guardian also asked whether anyone at the bank or the Rothschild family was aware of the allegations, and if so, whether they tried to tackle the issues.Lawyers acting for Rothschild & Co refused to answer whether there was any information related to misconduct by De Rothschild, stating only that an “initial review of their records” yielded “nothing”, but also saying they did not have enough information to investigate further. No response was received on behalf of the family.The Guardian also asked about the bank’s current and historical approach to complaints about sexual and other non-financial misconduct.View image in fullscreenThe claims against Evelyn de Rothschild are likely to raise questions about the working culture experiencedby women within the Rothschild banking empire.Photograph: Bloomberg/GettyVia lawyers, the banking group said: “We deal with any complaint quickly and decisively. We prize the culture we have developed over the years and there is no place for such behaviour in our culture.”They added: “If any inappropriate behaviour is alleged, including sexual misconduct, we seek to establish exactly what has happened. Whilst a formal complaint may not always be made, we investigate allegations of behaviour that falls below our standards.”Sources claimed De Rothschild would encourage women to think he could help with their careers, presenting himself as a potential sponsor or advocate in financial services. He would then request that they attend in his office on the pretence of a task or work-related conversation before harassing or assaulting them, it is alleged.If they expressed concerns about his actions to other members of staff, they would have their employment terminated, often with payouts, if they agreed to keep his activities confidential, it is alleged.“He would ask questions aimed at finding out if you were well connected. If you weren’t, then I think you were more likely to be regarded as fair game,”one woman claimed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As well as serving on the boards of the Telegraph Media Group and the Economist, he was also a director of the trust that owns the Globe theatre.Rothschild is one of the City of London’s most renowned institutions, and is among the most storied European banking institutions, with origins tracing back to 15th-century Frankfurt, Germany.The Rothschild family remains entwined with the institution, as a significant shareholder. As well as being a financial adviser to Queen Elizabeth II, De Rothschild also founded a charity with Mark Shand, the late brother of the current queen and was frequently pictured in conversation with King Charles when he was the Prince of Wales.He shared a passion for horse racing with the royal family and was chair of United Racehorses, which owned race courses at Sandown and Epsom. He was married three times.A range of high-profile figures attended his funeral, and his eulogy was delivered by Bill Clinton.The Rothschild group, which combines an array of financial services including investment banking and wealth management, was at the heart of the UK’s privatisation wave in the 1980s.Its London arm, NM Rothschild & Sons, was founded in 1809 by Nathan Mayer Rothschild, close to the Bank of England. Such was the sharp rise of its merchant banking activities that by 1826 it effectively saved the UK’s central bank with a loan of gold.NM Rothschild & Sons later merged with another arm of thefamily’s European banking empire, Paris Orléans SA, and in 2011, the company rebranded from NM Rothschild & Sons to Rothschild & Co. In 2015, the parent company of the Rothschild Group, which was previously called Paris Orléans, also changed its name to Rothschild & Co, according to the Rothschild Archive.The claims against De Rothschild come against a backdrop of historical complaints against men who held positions of power, notably the former Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed.Since his death two years ago, a number of women have come forward to make allegations against Fayed, with incidents dating back to the mid-1970s.Explore more on these topicsBankingFinancial sectorRothschild & ConewsShareReuse this content"

The dispute comes with the foreign secretary, David Lammy, leading attempts toshed the UK’s reputation as a hub for “dirty money”.The BVI do not currently publish details of who owns companies incorporated there, a practice that campaigners say makes the British overseas territory a magnet for financial crime, including money laundering and tax evasion.Companies based on the islands have appeared in multiple international investigations into alleged wrongdoing, including last month’srevelations by the Guardian and media partners about alleged tax evasionby the Russian oligarch and former Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich.Overseas territories have pledged to introduce publicly accessible registers of beneficial ownership (PARBOs), as have crown dependencies such as Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.However, last month, amid concern about delays and resistance, the BVI published proposals that have met with fury from MPs and civil society groups, who say the system would make it virtually impossible to find out who owns their companies.The row threatens to put the UK and the BVI on a constitutional collision course, amid calls for the government to issue a rarely used “order in council” to force the BVI to comply.The BVI proposals are part of a consultation process about granting access to corporate ownership data to people deemed to have a “legitimate interest” in the information, such as law enforcement agencies, businesses, journalists and civil society groups.However, under the draft policy, applicants could only get hold of company ownership information if they are involved in regulatory or legal proceedings about financial crime, or a criminal case where a court determines the data could help solve the investigation.The owner of the company would be tipped off about any such request and would have five days to object to the information being shared.In a letter to the premier of the BVI, Natalio Wheatley, MPs said this could “expose journalists to legal or physical intimidation when investigating high-risk stories on drug cartels, kleptocrats, or human traffickers”.It would also serve as an early warning system for “bad actors”, allowing them to liquidate assets before an investigation, wrote Joe Powell MP and Mitchell, who jointly chair the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on anti-corruption and responsible tax.They also criticised the “logical impossibility” of a proposal under which applicants would have to know the identity of a company’s owner in order to request information about who owns it.The BVI plans also include a narrow definition of what constitutes ownership, while access to the information would come with restrictions on how it could be used, including potential financial penalties and legal action for publishing it.Mitchell and Powell urged the BVI to reconsider their approach.Mitchell, a former development minister and deputy foreign secretary, said the BVI proposals showed “total contempt for the British parliament’s declared insistence that open registers of beneficial ownership be implemented throughout our overseas territories.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotion“Furthermore having led officials at the Foreign Office to believe they needed more time to implement open registers, we now see their intentions were very different.“This is nothing other than a shameful bid to continue to manage stolen funds and assist in money laundering from sources close to the sex trade and the drugs trade.“If the BVI wish to travel under the British rule of law, under our flag and under our monarch, they must also accept our values.”The Foreign Office is understood to be unhappy with the BVI proposals and hopes to persuade the territory’s government to improve them significantly. Officials made the UK’s position clear during a summit with the overseas territories in November last year.Mitchell echoedcalls previously issued by the government’s anti-corruption champion, Dame Margaret Hodge, for ministers to issue an “order in council” forcing the BVI to comply.The tool is used very rarely, in order to respect the self-governance of the overseas territories. It has previously been used to abolish the death penalty and decriminalise homosexuality in overseas territories.A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “This government has made tackling illicit finance in the UK, as well as in our overseas territories and crown dependencies a priority since day one. As the foreign secretary has said, he is taking up the issue of public registers of beneficial ownership with full vigour.”The campaign group Transparency International has also expressed grave concerns.MPs are due to discuss the progress of PARBOs during a Westminster Hall debate on Wednesday, amid growing concern about proposals by the BVIs and other overseas territories.The government of the BVI declined to comment. In a previous press release, it expressed a commitment to transparency and tackling financial crime. It added that the formulation of open registers required a “tailored approach” depending on the jurisdiction.Explore more on these topicsBritish Virgin IslandsTax havensAndrew MitchellCorporate governancenewsShareReuse this content"

Dončić, still only 25, is a five-time All-NBA selection.Stars of Dončić’s age and accomplishments are almost never traded, but Dallas decided to move on from their franchise star – and the Lakers eagerly accepted. Dončić acknowledged he was stunned.“Honestly, it was hard at first,” Dončić said. “That first day was really hard. I felt like these last 48 hours was one month. Emotionally, it was really hard, but today was much better. I’m just very happy to be here for this opportunity. This is the Lakers. It’s one of the best clubs in history, so I’m excited to be here.”Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka didn’t hide his excitement at landing Dončić when they met with the media at the team’s training complex.“We have one of the game’s biggest superstars and an international player coming to join the Lakers,” Pelinka said. “I think it’s going to be something incredibly special that the NBA and basketball has never seen before.”The trade stunned the sports world, leaving many Mavs fans furious. Reports around the trade – which indicated the Mavericks were unhappy with Dončić’s commitment to his fitness –infuriated the player’s father, Sasa, who said his son “absolutely did not deserve this.”Dončić hasn’t played since Christmas because of a calf strain, but he is thought to be close to a return to the court. The Lakers have four games in the Los Angeles area in the next seven days, including a road game against the Clippers on Tuesday night.The Lakers also acquired Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris in the trade with Dallas.Explore more on these topicsLuka DončićNBABasketballLos Angeles LakersDallas MavericksUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, declined to sit down for a Super Bowl interview in 2023 and 2024, as did Trump in 2018, during his first term as president.Trump is a keen sports fan and is often seen at golf tournaments and college football games. While he has been cheered at games, during his first term as president he was jeered and greeted with “lock him up” chants by Washington Nationals fansduring an appearance at the 2019 World Series. Last weekendCanadian NBA and NHL fans booedthe US national anthem as Trump threatened tariffs on US goods.Trump has not said which team he will be supporting on Sunday, although it would not be a surprise if he goes for the Chiefs. The Eagleswere disinvited from Trump’s White Housein 2018 after their last Super Bowl victory, while several figures around the Chiefs, including kicker Harrison Butker andBrittany Mahomes, the wife of Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes,have aligned themselveswith the Maga movement. Trump also congratulated the Chiefs when they reached the Super Bowl by beating the Buffalo Bills, a compliment he did not extend to the Eagles.“Congratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs,” Trump said on social media. “What a GREAT Team, Coach, Quarterback, and virtually everything else, including those fantastic FANS, that voted for me (MAGA!) in record numbers. Likewise, congratulations to the Buffalo Bills on a tremendous season. They will do a lot of winning long into the future!!!”The decision comes as a turnaround in Trump’s relationship with the NFL.

I feel like I still have a lot of good football left in me. We’ll see what happens. I know I’ve been setting myself up for other opportunities in my life. That’s always been the goal knowing football only lasts for so long. You have to find a way to get into another career and another profession. I’ve been doing that in my offseason. But for the most part, I plan on being a Kansas City Chief and playing football.”Are the Super Bowl-bound Kansas City Chiefs lucky, good or lucky and good?Read moreKelce is still playing at a high level even if he has fallen off from his peak. He had 97 catches this season but only gained 823 yards and scored three TDs,his lowest totalssince his rookie campaign in 2013. Kelce had a throwback game in the divisional round win over Houston with seven catches for 117 yards and enters the Super Bowl with the most catches ever in the playoffs (174) and second to Hall of Famer Jerry Rice in yards receiving (2,039) and TD catches (20).Kelce was one of the most popular players with the media during opening night with a large group of reporters surrounding his podium, peppering him with questions on topics from football to whether he planned to give Swift a ring if the Chiefs win on Sunday. He quickly responded, “A Super Bowl ring? Next question.”Kelce did say his relationship with Swift helps him on the football field by providing motivation that he needs to work as hard as she does to remain at the top of his game.“I better hold up my end of the bargain,” he said. “If she’s out here being the superstar she is, never taking no for an answer, and always working her tail off, I better match that energy for sure.”Another Chiefs player receiving plenty of attention on Monday night was kicker Harrison Butker, who last year generated headlines and drew criticism for his stance against Pride month and abortion. But he said he doesn’t feel the need to apologize for anything, although he did swerve some questions.At one point he was asked: “What do you think about gays?” He replied: “I understand that this is a great evening and we’re here to focus on the game. Maybe if I saw [the person who asked the question] without a camera, we’d have a great conversation.”View image in fullscreenHarrison Butker is questioned during the opening night festivities.Photograph: Matt York/APLast May, Butker was asked to deliver a commencement address at Benedictine College, a private Catholic liberal arts school.Among his polarizing remarks, Butker said that most of the women receiving degrees that daywere probably more excited about getting marriedand having children than entering the workforce, and that some Catholic leaders were “pushing dangerous gender ideologies onto the youth of America.”Butker also assailed Pride month and attacked Joe Biden’s stance on abortion, forcing the NFL to distance itself from the comments. As the summer gave way to election season, Butker was again in the spotlight as helaunched a political action committeedesigned to encourage Christians to vote for “traditional values”. Butker also spent time in July campaigning for Republican senator Josh Hawley, a staunch supporter of Donald Trump.“It was a surprise because I’d been saying similar things to that for many years now and it’s funny what stuff gets picked up,” Butker said on Monday of the attention he has received for his views. “I said what I said. I believe in it. I don’t feel the need to apologize for anything. I feel like God’s prepared me for that moment to feel confident in who I am and what’s most important in my life and I’m able to handle whatever comes my way.”Explore more on these topicsKansas City ChiefsSuper BowlTravis KelceNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The feelgood factor generated by the famous thrashing of Manchester City will not last long if a lack of attacking options means they cannot sustain their challenge in thePremier League.

Donyell Malen, Marco Asensio and Andrés García were smart moves to add depth to a squad that has struggled with the hectic schedule brought by playing in the expanded Champions League.

Bournemouth failed to do so, with Iraola ending up with two promising defenders instead. Julio Soler and Matai Akinmboni may be untested in the Premier League but the club’s recent record in the transfer market suggests they are ones to watch. The club did make a late addition in attack in the form of Eli Junior Kroupi, but the 18-year-old forward will remain with Lorient on loan until the end of the season and, as such, the loss of two influential forwards could hamper their push up the table.Will MageeKey ins:Julio Soler (Lanús, £6.6m), Matai Akinmboni (DC United, £2.1m), Eli Junior Kroupi (Lorient, £10m)Key outs:Mark Travers (Middlesbrough, loan), Max Aarons (Valencia, loan), Philip Billing (Napoli, loan)View image in fullscreenJulio Soler was one of two defenders brought in by Bournemouth.Photograph: Robin Jones/AFC Bournemouth/Getty ImagesBrentfordA relatively low-key window after Nottingham Forest’s bid for Yoane Wissa briefly unsettled things. Forest and a host of other clubs are likely to be back in the summer for the DR Congo forward and for Bryan Mbeumo but the Brentford manager, Thomas Frank, will be relieved to not have to answer questions about either for a few months.

There has been a sizeable turnover of players in this window as Fabian Hürzeler attempts to refine his squad, with Evan Ferguson allowed to join West Ham on loan and a number of younger players moving on. Tzimas – a highly rated 19-year-old coveted by several other clubs – will be loaned back to Nürnberg until the end of the season.EAKey ins:Stefanos Tzimas (Nürnberg, £20.8m), Diego Gómez (Inter Miami, £12m), Eiran Cashin (Derby, £9m)Key outs:Jakub Moder (Feyenoord, £1.6m), Julio Enciso (Ipswich, loan), Evan Ferguson (West Ham, loan)ChelseaA strange window. Trevoh Chalobah solved a defensive crisis by returning from his loan at Crystal Palace, even though he was pushed out last summer. There were calls for more depth in midfield and attack. The upshot was a deal for a 19-year-old midfielder, Mathis Amougou. Meanwhile there were constant stories about fringe players going, even though some had only just arrived. Renato Veiga, Ben Chilwell and Carney Chukwuemeka left on loan and the squad looks light after João Félix – signed for £45m from Atlético Madrid and handed a seven-year deal last summer – headed to Milan for the rest of the season.Jacob SteinbergKey ins:Trevoh Chalobah (Crystal Palace, loan ended)Key outs:Cesare Casadei (Torino, £12.5m), Renato Veiga (Juventus, loan), Carney Chukwuemeka (Borussia Dortmund, loan), Ben Chilwell (Crystal Palace, loan), João Félix (Milan, loan)View image in fullscreenTrevor Chalobah was recalled by Chelsea from Crystal Palace.Photograph: Warren Little/Getty ImagesCrystal PalaceOliver Glasner will be pleased to have finally brought in another exciting prospect from the Championship in the form of Romain Esse and Chilwell adds much-needed cover at left wing-back after being exiled by Chelsea. After the west London club recalled Chalobah and Chadi Riad sustained a season-ending injury, Palace had no choice but to reject a late bid from Tottenham for captain Marc Guéhi given that Glasner only has three frontline central defenders left. Guéhi looks set to depart in the summer when he enters the final year of his contract, with Liverpool and Chelsea among several other interested clubs.EAKey ins:Romain Esse (Millwall, £12m), Ben Chilwell (Chelsea, loan)Key outs:Trevoh Chalobah (Chelsea, loan ended), Jeffrey Schlupp (Celtic, loan)EvertonDavid Moyes said at his unveiling as Everton’s new/old manager that the club should be “getting some elite players” for the elite stadium they will be playing in next season, but inherited issues put that ambition on hold until the summer. Everton offset the loss of Orel Mangala to a season-ending knee injury by signing the attacking midfielder Carlos Alcaraz on loan from Flamengo with an option to buy butPSR constraints and a lack of proven and available options willing to join a relegation fight thwarted numerous attempts to strengthen in attack. Moyes must do with one fit striker, Beto, until at least March.Andy HunterKey ins:Carlos Alcaraz (Flamengo, loan)Key outs:Harrison Armstrong (Derby, loan)FulhamThere may be some frustration at the lack of incomings given that Marco Silva’s side have an outside chance of challenging for Europe. Fulham had designs on bringing in a right-back and a winger but nothing transpired. Will it cost them? At least Silva has not lost any key players since selling João Palhinha to Bayern Munich last summer. At what point, though, will he start to get itchy feet? A sprinkling of quality could have helped Fulham push from ninth place.JSKey ins:NoneKey outs:NoneIpswichA mixed window for Ipswich finished with a late move for the West Brom keeper Alex Palmer, necessitated by injury and uncertain form afflicting their existing options. Loan moves for Ben Godfrey and Julio Enciso, along with the £20m addition of Jaden Philogene, had been longer in the making and add quality to a squad that faces its work cut out to stay up. But Ipswich did not land the seasoned centre-forward relief for Liam Delap that they sorely lack, and they could also have done with a robust midfield addition. A late nibble at their former player Flynn Downes, unsettled at Southampton, came to nothing. At least the sought-after Delap will stay put for now.Nick AmesKey ins:Jaden Philogene (Aston Villa, £20m), Alex Palmer (West Brom, £2m), Julio Enciso (Brighton, loan), Ben Godfrey (Atalanta, loan)Key outs:George Edmundson (Middlesbrough, £500,000), Harry Clarke (Sheffield United, loan), Ali al-Hamadi (Stoke, loan)LeicesterLeicester have looked especially short up front under Ruud van Nistelrooy but their only signing was a defender. Woyo Coulibaly can play on either side of the back four and should add counterattacking threat but, with one senior career goal, he is unlikely to solve the scoring problems. Leicester have netted nine goals in 11 league games under their latest manager and, although their defence has also been erratic, they will not stay up with so little output. Van Nistelrooy will have to use the tools at his disposal to remedy that shortfall after a dishearteningly quiet window.WMKey ins:Woyo Coulibaly (Parma, £3m)Key outs:Tom Cannon (Sheffield United, £10m), Hamza Choudhury (Sheffield United, loan)skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The level of player who could make a difference for the Premier League leaders was not on the market. With strength in depth, particularly up front, Liverpool’s priority was to get more game-time for emerging young talent. Kaide Gordon joined Portsmouth on loan until the end of the season and Jayden Danns’ loan to Sunderland was confirmed on Tuesday. As for those three contracts …AHKey ins:NoneKey outs:Kaide Gordon (Portsmouth, loan), Stefan Bajcetic (Las Palmas, loan), Jayden Danns (Sunderland, loan)Manchester CityPep Guardiola consistently mentions how he and the club are reluctant to do business in the winter window so signing four frontline players – the forward Omar Marmoush, Nico González (midfielder), Vitor Reis and Abdukodir Khusanov (defenders) – is indicative of City’s disappointing campaign. The manager has been supported with a total spend of £172m so Guardiola’s task is to secure a Champions League berth and mount a challenge for the third FA Cup of his tenure.Jamie JacksonKey ins:Omar Marmoush (Eintracht Frankfurt, £59.1m), Nico González (Porto, £49.8m), Abdukodir Khusanov (Lens, £33.8m), Vitor Reis (Palmeiras, £29.6m)Key outs:Kyle Walker (Milan, loan)View image in fullscreenOmar Marmoush was one of four Manchester City signings.Photograph: Shaun Brooks/CameraSport/Getty ImagesManchester UnitedRuben Amorim, parachuted in during autumn when he preferred summer, has to be disappointed (and worried) regarding a contender for the club’s poorest-ever window. Rashford is United’s finest forward but he and the head coach fell out so he was loaned to Villa. Antony, who lacks Rashford’s talent, has also gone on a temporary deal, to Real Betis. So Amorim is down two forwards and has been handed zero replacements by the Sir Jim Ratcliffe-led football department. United made three recruits: Patrick Dorgu, a left-sided defender/wing-back; Ayden Heaven, an 18-year-old centre-back prospect; and, on a pre-contract, Diego León, 17, a defender. But however good they prove the squad will remain a disjointed mess.JJKey ins:Patrick Dorgu (Lecce, £25.1m)Key outs:Marcus Rashford (Aston Villa, loan), Antony (Real Betis, loan)NewcastleIf Newcastle fail to win the Carabao Cup and do not qualify for Europe it will be easy to pin the blame on an absence of spending in this window. Although the Saudi Arabian owners are not exactly short of cash, they are concerned about potentially breaching Premier League spending rules and told Eddie Howe he would be selling rather than buying. It means Newcastle’s manager has lost Miguel Almirón to Atlanta for £8m and Lloyd Kelly to Juventus on an initial loan which will become a £20m July transfer. The idea is that balancing the books now will enable Howe to restock his squad in the summer but there remains an inherent risk. If Newcastle miss out on Champions League qualification Alexander Isak, Bruno Guimarães, Sandro Tonali and Anthony Gordon may demand to leave.Louise TaylorKey ins:NoneKey outs:Miguel Almirón (Atlanta United, £8m), Lloyd Kelly (Juventus, loan)View image in fullscreenMiguel Almirón left Newcastle for Atlanta.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersNottingham ForestArguably this has been Nottingham Forest’s most successful transfer window since returning to the Premier League because they were happy to sign no one for the starting XI, a true sign of a maturing operation. The only arrivals were the return of the third-choice goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey, who has been training at the club for a while as he recovered from injury, and the long-term prospect Joel Ndala on loan from Manchester City. They made a serious attempt to sign Wissa but their bid was knocked back by Brentford. They have held their nerve in the market, neither panicking nor buying players for the sake of it as they chase the European dream.WUKey ins:Wayne Hennessey (free agent)Key outs:James Ward-Prowse (West Ham, loan ended)SouthamptonThe main aim from here is making sure not to break Derby’s record for the lowest number of points in a Premier League season. Survival still seems a long way off, even after victory over Ipswich. Southampton have been quiet, restricting themselves to a handful of unremarkable signings. The positive, though, is that they have managed to hold on to Tyler Dibling. The young winger has impressed and has interest from a host of clubs in England and Europe. He looks certain to go in the summer.JSKey ins:Joachim Kayi Sanda (Valenciennes, £4.2m), Albert Grønbæk (Rennes, loan), Wellington (São Paulo, free)Key outs:Ben Brereton Díaz (Sheffield United, loan), Gavin Bazunu (Standard Liège, loan)TottenhamAnge Postecoglou made no secret of his need for reinforcements and the idea was to be able to play them in January as injuries ravaged his squad. Apart from the goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky, who was signed on 5 January, that did not happen. Spurs left it late to add the centre-half and forward they so badly needed in Kevin Danso and Mathys Tel. And there is irony in that the bulk of the walking wounded are expected to return to training in the next seven days or so. That does not apply to Radu Dragusin, who is a long-term knee ligament casualty. Was Postecoglou disappointed not to add another centre-half? With Cristian Romero still out, it was a worry when the manager put Micky van de Ven back on ice for Sunday’s trip to Brentford after the centre-half made a 45-minute comeback against Elfsborg last Thursday.David HytnerKey ins:Antonin Kinsky (Slavia Prague, £12.5m), Kevin Danso (Lens, loan), Mathys Tel (Bayern Munich, loan)Key outs:NoneWest HamThe priority had to be signing a striker in response to Michail Antonio and Niclas Füllkrug being sidelined with long-term injuries. A number of options were considered and Graham Potter’s patience was rewarded when Brighton’s Evan Ferguson arrived on loan. Potter gave Ferguson his debut at Brighton and will hope to kickstart the youngster’s career after a difficult 18 months. It will not be easy but West Ham have a player with high potential. A shortage of bodies in midfield was solved by bringing back James Ward-Prowse from his loan at Nottingham Forest.JSKey ins:Evan Ferguson (Brighton, loan), James Ward-Prowse (Nottingham Forest, loan ended)Key outs:NoneView image in fullscreenEvan Ferguson has joined West Ham on loan from Brighton.Photograph: West Ham United FC/Getty ImagesWolvesThe appointment of Vítor Pereira in December was likely to instigate work in the market because he saw the failings within the squad. Unfortunately, it was not the smoothest month at Wolves; rumours swirled around the future of Matheus Cunha and signings proved hard to come by, demonstrated by missing out to Tottenham on Danso. The impressive Emmanuel Agbadou joined from Reims to bolster the defence and was soon reunited with his former clubmate Marshall Munetsi and joined by Nasser Djiga. Wolves hope those two will settle as quickly. Most importantly, Cunha stayed.WUKey ins:Emmanuel Agbadou (Reims,£16.6m), Marshall Munetsi (Reims, £16m), Nasser Djiga (Red Star Belgrade,£10m)Key outs:NoneExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueanalysisShareReuse this content"

A bid for Ollie Watkins, believed to have been worth around £40m,was rejected by Aston Villa last week, with Arsenal also deciding not to follow up their interest in the Bayern Munich forward Mathys Tel,who joined ­Tottenham on loaninstead.Eddie Howe tells Newcastle to ‘leave a legacy’ against Arsenal in Carabao CupRead moreArteta was at pains to point out that their lack of activity this month will putArsenalin a stronger financial position in the summer, when they are expected to renew their pursuit of the RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. But he also recognised that any more injury setbacks could leave them short for the final few months of the season.“We had a clear intention which is always there is a window open to explore the opportunities to improve our squad with players that can impact it,” Arteta said. “We haven’t achieved it so we are disappointed in that sense but as well we are very aware that we only want to bring ­certain kinds of players and we have to be very disciplined with that and I think we will.”Asked if he saw it as a gamble, Arteta said: “It’s not a gamble, it’s reality. I think we have to face the reality as well that we have. So we’re going to have to evolve there as well and have more and have more players from the academy and the ones that are here to be fitter longer.“That’s a job that is permanent and it keeps evolving and we need to be on our toes. We’re going to have to be very flexible in the front line and now the ones that we have and are fit, make sure that they stay fit and they keep contributing.”Kai Havertz is Arsenal’s only recog­nised centre-forward, although Arteta said Leandro Trossard, Raheem Sterling and Ethan Nwaneri – who turns 18 next month and needs only two more goals to match Wayne Rooney’s tally of nine senior goals before his 18th birthday – could also fill in. Arteta is hoping that Havertz’s fitness record means he can last the course this season.“He has played a lot of football but his robustness, his availability is unbelievable. When you ask him, he feels better when he is playing every three days. Against Girona for example, we gave him a rest. And then he felt fresher. He then had a very demanding game physically against Manchester City for the role that he had to do. We will see how they are. Players give you a lot of information but if you are playing well and scoring goals, all this helps.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Almirón previously played for Atlanta from their inaugural season in 2017 through 2019, during which time the club won the 2018 MLS Cup.Between the two deals, Atlanta United now own the MLS record fee paid for a player as well as the league record initial fee received – Almirón’s transfer to Newcastle United for a reported fee of around $27m in 2019. That was the largest overall outgoing transfer in MLS history until very recently. Aston Villa’s fee paid to the Chicago Fire for Colombian striker Jhon Duran just recently surpassed that mark thanks to Duran hitting performance benchmarks during his time at Villa and a sell-on percentage after his recent$79m move to Saudi Arabia.Latte Lath scored 29 goals in 67 matches for Middlesbrough from 2023-25, including a team-high 11 goals during the current campaign. He launched his pro career with Italy’s Atalanta as a 17-year-old in 2016.“At 26 years old, he’s entering the prime years of his career and has already shown his goal-scoring ability in multiple leagues in Europe,” Henderson said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His remarks came just over a week after the refereeMichael Oliver received death threatsafter an apparent error in a match.Time to blow the whistle on abuse of football referees | LettersRead moreScholes said of refereeing standards: “The feedback that I’m getting from clubs is that the vast majority recognised significant progress in this area. But that is also the case with other leagues around the world, where they all look up to the match officials in this country and indeed the VAR process and VAR officials in this country as a model that they would like to follow. Sometimes it doesn’t feel that way here in England, but that’s the message that I get from people around the world.”Twelve months ago Scholes admitted the implementation of VAR had been“nowhere near good enough”but this year he returned with a more positive message. Scholes said there had been 64 errors made by referees in key match incidents this season, up to and including game week 23, down from 80 over the same period a year ago. There were 70 VAR interventions during that time, with 66 correctly overturning a decision.“That’s less than one intervention in three games, which shows that the interference of the VAR is perhaps not at the level that many of us perceive it is,” Scholes said. “We should also recognise that the number of VAR errors has gone down substantially from 20 to 13 too.“I stress to clubs all the time that nobody here underestimates the significance and the impact of one single error. We know it can cost clubs points, can cost them results, can cost managers [their] positions potentially.“It’s absolutely right that we continue to push these officials to be as good as they can be. But it’s also right that we acknowledge the progress that has been made, because we do not get the best performance out of people if we are constantly criticising, constantly beating [people] up over errors made. It’s right we should acknowledge the progress.”Scholes confirmed that the length of VAR delays had also come down from more than a minute per match in the 2023-24 season to 40 seconds. It is a reduction that has occurred without semi-automated offside technology (SOAT), which had been expected to be implemented before Christmas but has met with problems in testing.“We are making significant progress,” Scholes said of SAOT. “I have to confess given the difficulties that we had over the first few months of the season, I had severe doubts about this but we’ve made a lot of progress in this area now. We believe we’re going to be adopting the best system and the most accurate system. I’m hopeful that at some point this season we will be able to introduce SAOT technology, but I repeat the point made a number of times: we are not going to introduce it if we’ve got any doubts at all with regard to its operation.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said her comments had left him “shocked, upset and humiliated”. She denies the charges.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailDuring cross-examination on Tuesday, Kerr’s defence barrister, Grace Forbes, asked Lovell about this first statement, which was submitted on the day of the incident which occurred in the early hours of 30 January 2023. She put it to Lovell: “Your first statement made no mention of stupid and white having had an impact.”Lovell said it did not.She then accused Lovell of submitting a second statement in December 2023 “because the CPS declined to charge Kerr”, saying “only a year later did you make mention of these words having had an impact on you … The CPS identified there was no evidence of harassment, alarm or distress. You knew that was the obstacle?”.“No,” Lovell said.“You are claiming this impact purely to get a criminal charge over the line?” she asked him.“No,” he said.Swedish police say about 10 people dead in Örebro campus attackRead moreLovell was also asked about Kerr’s status as a well-known sports star. Forbes suggested to him: “You made an assumption about her that she was a troublemaker, that she was difficult and, because of what she does for a living, she was an arrogant person?”In response, Lovell said he did not know what Kerr did for a living.Forbes disputed his denial, saying “you told her very early on, that you knew exactly who she was”. Lovell said he did not recall saying that but he knew she was a “famous football player” after a colleague told him.Kerr and Mewis had ended up at the station after a dispute with a cab driver about paying to clean up after one of them was sick in the cab.Forbes said one of Lovell’s colleagues asked him if only Kerr and Mewis would be arrested or whether the driver would be too. Forbes said Lovell’s response, according to body-worn camera footage, “was to screw up your face and say, ‘He’s not going to get nicked.’”Lovell replied that he had not spoken directly to the driver but that he had made an “informed decision” based on an account given to him by a colleague.Forbes also mentioned footage of Lovell saying to Kerr, “Calm yourself down, young missy.”In response, he told the court: “I was trying to get my point across.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In it, he described Kerr’s comments as leaving him “shocked, upset” and “feeling humiliated”. On the comments about his race specifically, he said: “They were too far and I took great offence to them.”Two witness statements from other officers present said Kerr had made numerous remarks about “white privilege”, the court heard, adding she had called one officer “literally a white privilege man”.“I wasn’t sure why Kerr mentioned skin colour, as no one had done so previously,” one of the statements said.Kerr visited Twickenham police station at 10.30pm on 30 January 2023. She was not accompanied by a lawyer.PC Ryan Skinner interviewed Kerr. In an audio recording of the interview played to the court on Tuesday, Kerr said she “was in a taxi, and I did vomit outside the window”, after which “the taxi driver became very aggressive, and drove very very dangerously”.She said she had clicked the “emergency thing” on her phone and spoken to someone.Australian officials left scrambling over Trump’s ‘unclear’ tariff proposals following election, documents revealRead moreInitially, Kerr said she did not recall calling any of the officers “fucking stupid and white” but, after being shown footage of her making these remarks, she said: “I was obviously intoxicated and I shouldn’t have been so front-footed but I was very, very threatened with how I felt and I’m a very honest person.“I didn’t feel protected in that moment as a female and I’m here voluntarily because I want this sorted out.”She later added that she did not feel protected in the police station because “we only spoke to three males even though we were with a dangerous male”.Skinner asked Kerr if her comments could be perceived as racist. She replied: “I am aware that anything can be perceived as racist, for sure.”Kerr told Skinner that she would “apologise” to the officers for the “whole event”. “I wish I walked away and dealt with it in the morning, like I am now.

It spoke not just of widespread recognition among Europe’s elite clubs of the 19‑year‑old’s quality but of a shift of policy in the Bundesliga leaders’ camp; from shutting their ears to all approaches at the beginning of January to accepting that leveraging a financial advantage out of the situation was the best they could do. A month-long transfer window leaves room for plenty of changes of heart and mind.Some will snort that Tottenham were a mere backup choice after Tel declined their initial approach, that the forward blinked when faced with the prospect of a second half of theBundesligaseason like his first, given a mere 253 minutes of playing time. More probable is that an especially reflective young man took time to think of what would work best for him rather than what would most suit Bayern. There is little contradictory about the process when you consider Tel is an explosive attacking weapon with the maturity to constantly adapt.Transfer window verdict: how every Premier League club faredRead moreFiercely ambitious yet humble. Enormously confident in his ability yet grounded. Surrounded by close family after Bayern games, but not stuck in his bubble; when L’Équipe sent a journalist to Munich to interview Tel at the club’s Säbener Strasse training centre last year, the young forward arrived to greet him with a smile on his face and a box full of pastries fresh from a local French patisserie.And frustrated, without doubt, by being the perpetual understudy to Harry Kane but never less than grateful for everything he has been able to learn in the past 17 months from the England captain, who has a high regard for Tel. Backing up Kane, the hyper-reliable superstar who never rests, must be the most infuriating role in world football for a youngster with talent to burn and a barely containable desire to improve. It has also led to Tel being slightly miscast.You may have already read descriptions ofTottenham’s new manas a winger. His natural gifts – and Kane’s natural indefatigability – may have frequently pushed Tel out wide, but sometimes his natural abilities suggest he is something that perhaps he is not. The pace, the ability to take on defenders and the intelligence to find the right pass for a teammate make him perfect winger material. It’s just, most of the time, that he’s only in these positions to fit around Kane.View image in fullscreenMathys Tel signed for Tottenham on deadline day with an option to buy over the summer.Photograph: Alex Morton/Tottenham Hotspur FC/ShutterstockMaybe, in time, the way in which Tel has broadened his palette could be considered a belated parting gift from the England captain to his old club. The France Under-21 player’s first instinct has always been to shoot, with the power he has in either foot. Within weeks of Tel’s arrival in Bavaria, Thomas Müller heralded him as “an unbelievable finisher”. That ability to take chances is borne out by his tally of 10 goals last season, despite being given only nine starts across the Bundesliga, DFB‑Pokal and Champions League, with Thomas Tuchel building on Julian Nagelsmann’s experiments in sending Tel on in the closing stages to voraciously attack weary defences.Yet the really interesting statistic is the six assists that accompany the goals. Rather than having a desperation to catch the coach’s attention with a spectacular individual contribution, Tel regularly underlined his wit and humility to do what the team needed. Take the Champions League win against Galatasaray in November 2023. One-on-one with his future Bayern teammate Sacha Boey, he might have been tempted to cut in and get a shot off to make his mark. Instead, he set up Kane with a precise first‑time pass for an easy tap-in to ice a devilishly difficult game.That ability and versatility should come as no surprise, given that Tel is from impeccable footballing stock. He was born in the suburbs of Paris but is a graduate of the elite academy production line at Rennes, which has produced players including Yoann Gourcuff, Sylvain Wiltord, Yann M’Vila, Ousmane Dembélé and Eduardo Camavinga. It was Camavinga’s record that Tel broke in August 2021 when he became the youngest player to turn out for Rennes, at 16 years, three months and 19 days. A year later (after a €28.5m transfer) he became Bayern’s youngest scorer, in a Pokal win against Viktoria Köln, eclipsing Jamal Musiala.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Whereas Tuchel planned to leave Kane out of games in the Pokal, Germany’s national cup competition, the new coach started Kane at Mainz in late October. Tel entered in Kane’s stead at half-time with Bayern 4-0 up – garbage time, as it would be framed in basketball. The logjam in wide areas – with Leroy Sané, a revitalised Kingsley Coman, the arrival of Michael Olise and sometimes Musiala competing for roles – has left little room for Tel elsewhere in the team.So off to Tottenham he goes and, whether by accident or design, it feels like the perfect destination. With his preference to play at centre-forward or in the corridor between the centre and the left (a little like his more senior compatriot Kylian Mbappé), the picture appears all set up for Tel to provide Spurs with a succession plan for Son Heung-min. He can contribute in the short term and have the team built around him next. By choosing to leave Bayern, Tel has underlined that he considers now to be his time.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurBayern MunichBundesligaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I want to thank the team because we’ve made a huge effort,” the Argentina winger told Teledeporte. “I’m happy for the goals, I think about the things I have to improve day by day, I still have many flaws and details that I want to improve to keep growing.”Ángel Correa then scored with a superb low shot from distance in the 78th minute, before setting up Alexander Sørloth, who also came on in the second half, to seal the rout four minutes from time.Having secured a spot in the semi-finals for the second consecutive season, Atlético will turn their attention to La Liga where they face they leadersReal Madridin the derby on Saturday.Real Madridwill be without Kylian Mbappé and Jude Bellingham for their Copa del Rey quarter-final atLeganésonWednesday.

Despite City’s poor start to the season, there were doubts among supporters (andeven the odd journalist) atthe appointment of Lampardand the sacking of Robins, who had previously been approaching legendary status (and later given an honorary doctorate by Coventry University for his impact on the club and the city).Championship roundup: leaders Leeds drop points in six-goal thriller at HullRead moreThe club statement announcing Robins’s sacking even acknowledged he was “one of the Coventry’s greatest ever managers” after a seven-year reign in which he had “overseen the resurrection from the depths of League Two, to champions of League One and to a hair’s breadth away from both the Premier League and a second FA Cup final, while competing in theChampionshipfor a fifth consecutive season”.Perhaps replacing Robins at Coventry is not the seismic task that David Moyes faced in replacing Sir Alex Ferguson, or Unai Emery did in replacing Arsène Wenger, but Lampard accepting a job at a relegation-threatened club against the backdrop of supporter fury and bemusement is not the ideal set of circumstances. Especially for a manager who – perhaps unfairly – was seen to be approaching the last-chance saloon after 18 months out of the game.Yet after a surge up the table under Lampard, Coventry are now three points from the playoff places. It is fair to say those who doubted the decision to appoint the former England midfielder are eating humble pie.How has Lampard had such a dramatic impact? “The biggest difference is we are not conceding as many goals as we did,” says Steve Ogrizovic, the former Coventry goalkeeper who now is a regular at the CBS Arena for BBC Sport Coventry & Warwickshire. “It’s not rocket science. I was very surprised when the decision was made but Frank is a role model, someone that the players can aspire to. He certainly has the respect of everybody and has got them playing really well at the moment.”Central to the resurgence under Lampard has been the form of the summer signing Jack Rudoni, who has featured in all 30 of Coventry’s league games this season. After two excellent seasons for Huddersfield, the London-born midfielder with an American grandfather was contacted by the USA last year before the Olympics only for passport issues to scupper any involvement at Paris 2024. If that proved to be a disappointment for Rudoni then the 23-year-old’s £4m summer move to Coventry has since seen him become one of the best creators in the Championship – only Tom Fellows at West Brom and Finn Azaz at Middlesbrough have more assists.Quick GuideParker calls on Burnley to be more clinicalShowScott Parker admitted confidence could be an issue for Burnley's attacking players after they needed an own goal from Michal Helik to edge out Oxford 1-0 and move into the top two of the Championship.After failing to register a shot on target in last week's goalless draw at home to Leeds, the last of three consecutive 0-0 draws at Turf Moor and one that was followed by another stalemate at Portsmouth at the weekend, Burnley looked much more threatening with 15 efforts on goal, seven on target.\"Maybe it's a psychological element a little bit because of the general noise around it, human nature is sometimes maybe that noise gravitates a bit and snowballs, that maybe could be the case,\" Parker said.\"We missed some good chances, that's clear. I'm more pleased we had those big chances, in the right positions, that conviction about us, not hiding, putting yourself on offer to miss that chance is key for me as a coach. We did that, and we didn't execute.\"Meanwhile, Marti Cifuentes has urged Queen's Park Rangers to keep pushing for the play-offs after they arrested their recent slide with a 2-1 win over Blackburn.\"I'm very pleased, not only about the win but because it was important to come back after two defeats in a row,\" said the head coach. \"It was important for us emotionally to come back and get a good win at home against a good team. The players need to keep pushing because nothing is decided.\"Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“Rudoni has been good all season, but strikers Ellis Simms and Brandon Thomas-Asante have also started to score goals,” says Ogrizovic.“Oliver Dovin in goal has been playing a lot better. But it’s been a team performance. You have to bear in mind that all this has happened without [the sidelined] Ben Sheaf and Haji Wright, two of their best players. And you can add Ephron Mason-Clark to that, he was bang in form when he got injured.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With Lampard at the helm, it is not a surprise that Coventry’s midfield is now one of the most productive and confident in the division.“We’ve made an inspired signing in Matt Grimes but there’s still a long way to go,” says Ogrizovic. “Everyone knows what the Championship is like.

He has, therefore, called on his team to “attack the game” in order to seal a place at Wembley and seek to end Newcastle’s long wait for silverware.Arsenal heading for Newcastle ‘to score three, four, five’, warns MartinelliRead more“All our players have to show they can rise to the occasion, that they can leave a legacy on the pitch and do something that everybody talks about for years and years,” said Howe. “What an opportunity we have to attack the game and embrace everything in front of us, to be at our best.”Given that Newcastle,losing Carabao Cup finalists two years ago, have not won a major domestic trophy since 1955, the occasion will, inevitably, come freighted with emotion. “Nerves and excitement are closely linked and I understand the brain can go in different directions,” said Howe, whose side have won 10 of their past 12 games but lost the last two at home. “But what a great opportunity we’ve got.”The month-long gap between the two legs has seen Arsenal’s form improve appreciably while Newcastle have faltered and there is real apprehension on Tyneside that this shift in the power balance will be reflected on the pitch.“Whether a 2-0 lead is the most dangerous in football is probably a conversation for another time; you could go into depth on that,” said Howe. “But it’s only dangerous if you don’t perform. So the message is we have to perform. That’s the challenge. But I don’t think too much focus on the dynamics of the scoreline is healthy for the brain.”Although Callum Wilson could finally be sufficiently fit to occupy a seat on Newcastle’s substitutes’ bench, a knee injury dictates that Joelinton’s involvement in midfield is touch and go. If the latter’s absence would delight Arsenal’s manager, Mikel Arteta, the tie is less likely to be affected by the hitherto fringe defender Lloyd Kelly’s deadline-day move to Juventus.Newcastle’s concerns about meeting Premier League spending rules meant Howe was unable to strengthen his squad and he admitted he had not encouraged Kelly’s move to Italy on an initial loan deal obliged to become a £20m summertime transfer. “I don’t think it was necessarily my decision to let him leave,” said the manager. “We were very reluctant from our side.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Arne Slot admitted after the game that it was “not a good sign” when the 26-year-old asked to be substituted, but scans have revealed a minor problem that is expected to rule him out for days rather than weeks.Transfer window verdict: how every Premier League club faredRead moreSlot is unlikely to take any risks given Liverpool’s pursuit of four trophies. The head coach has Conor Bradley available to take Alexander-Arnold’s place and Joe Gomez is nearing a return having been sidelined sinceDecember’s rout of West Hamwith a hamstring injury.Alexander-Arnold is, therefore, expected to miss the visit of Spurs,who take a 1-0 lead into the game, as well as Sunday’s visit to Plymouth in the fourth round of the FA Cup. The England international could return for the rearranged Merseyside derby at Everton a week on Wednesday.Sunderland, meanwhile, have confirmed Jayden Danns has joined on loan for the rest of the season. A deal for the 19-year-oldLiverpoolforward was completed before the transfer deadline on Monday but the announcement was delayed due to Sunderland having a key Championship fixture that night at Middlesbrough, which Régis Le Bris’s side won 3-2.Danns, who signed a long-term contract with Liverpool before agreeing the loan, will not be available for Sunderland immediately due to a back problem. The teenager will continue his rehabilitation at Liverpool’s training ground before joining up with the promotion contenders at a later date.“This is my first loan move and a chance to prove myself, so I’m very appreciative of the opportunity and grateful to the club for placing their faith in me,” said Danns. “I’m disappointed that I will be unable to do that straight away, but I’m proud to have joined the club and I will work hard throughout this period to ensure I can return to action and play my part.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolCarabao CupTottenham HotspurTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

Afterloaning Marcus Rashford to Aston Villaand Antony to Real Betis, there were no funds to replace the forwards in Amorim’s squad. This was despite Villa paying a minimum 75% of ­Rashford’s £365,000-a-week wage and Betis sourcing 84% of Antony’s salary of £150,000 a week.The constricted budget meant no move was made to sign cover for ­Lisandro ­Martínez after the defender ­sustained a suspected season-ending anterior cruciate ligament injury inthe 2-0 defeat by Crystal Palaceon Sunday.The number of players whose sale would draw a sizeable profit for the summer window is also limited. Rashford’s loan terms with Villa are thought to include a buy option for £40m. As a homegrown player, his fee would count as 100% profit under profit and sustainability rules, and funds would be saved by his lucrative contract being taken off the books three years before it ends in 2028.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There were the people who felt genuinely betrayed by Henderson’s controversial decision to move to the Saudi Pro League, the people who pretended to feel genuinely betrayed on behalf of the people who felt genuinely betrayed by Henderson’s controversial decision to move to the Saudi Pro League and then, well … the people who just don’t like, or were jealous of, Jordan Henderson.Having endured so much public opprobrium, Henderson must have felt a bit of a plum when he decided to leave Al-Ettifaq for Ajax within six months. He could have pointed out that he was swapping one of the most conservative countries in the world for one of the most liberal, but mercifully elected not to kick that particular hornet’s nest. Since then he has been plugging away in the Dutch top flight, largely forgotten by English fans who never have to wait too long before being confronted by some new example of rank player hypocrisy or doublespeak to be outraged by. Until, that is, footage went viral of a post-match presser in which Henderson became embroiled in a heated debate with Mike Verweij, a Dutch football writer, over whether or not he had spent the final few days of the January transfer window agitating for a move to Monaco.A quick – although not as quick as we’d like – primer: Ajax find themselves in financial peril, Henderson is their biggest earner and the club’s manager Francesco Farioli is reported to have told the press his skipper was trying to force a move to Monaco. Last Thursday, Henderson played for Ajax in their Bigger Vase win over Galatasaray, but refused to captain the side or join his teammates in their goal celebrations. Following that win, Farioli repeatedly refused to comment on speculation linking Henderson with a move to Monaco and, when Ajax beat Feyenoord on Sunday, Hendo rocked up for the post-match press conference, puffed out his chest, and took his seat. He then weirdly repeated the first three questions that were asked back to his interrogator, denied he had been trying to secure a move to the principality, claimed he was happy to remain at Ajax and then got stuck into Verweij for raising doubts about his professional probity.“Of course I am happy to stay,” he roared. “My plan was to stay here at least until the end of the season and then re-evaluate. A lot of things were taken out of context in the press. That was disrespectful, they were lies. Untruths were told about me as a person. I tried to focus, but it feels painful. I think 99% of people, if they knew the inside information, wouldn’t have played the game [on Thursday] but yet, people in this room have questioned my professionalism and me as a person – I think it’s bang out of order. People may criticise me because of my game, but when it gets personal … I am a human being with family: parents, a wife and children. If they read things in the press that are not true, that is going too far.” Invited by his detractors to specify which bits of their reportage were disrespectful or untrue, Henderson refused to elaborate.QUOTE OF THE DAYIt got to half-time and I thought: ‘Oh my gosh, I don’t know if I can carry this on.’ But I decided I was sticking to my word.

On the other hand, it does not greatly stiffen England’s defence, as Bundee Aki underlined last Saturday. A rampant France,who won 53-10on their last visit to Twickenham two years ago, will not go easy on either England’s rookie fly-half or their makeshift full-back.Marcus Smith did fill in at full‑back for all but eight minutes of the match against France in Lyon last year, when England were edged out in a thrilling game. The England backs coach, Richard Wigglesworth, speaking at the team hotel in Bagshot, opted to sidestep direct selection questions but he sees no reason why the time to unite the Smiths cannot be now.View image in fullscreenEngland’s Fin Smith during a training session this week.Photograph: Adam Davy/PA“We’ve seen Marcus at 15 with George Ford and we’ve seen him with Fin,” Wigglesworth said. “He’s obviously another set of eyes that are very opportunistic. ‘Where’s the space? Who can I beat?’ Whether it is with George or with Fin, that’s what it would bring.“I think we are blessed with three 10s who can all play international rugby to a high level. Fin has had less chance than the rest at the moment, but he is really clear with his game. He is confident without being arrogant and wants to get better. He has all the things you associate with top 10s. He is really clear with what he wants and how to best position the team. I’ve been super impressed with him.“We’ve got some unbelievably talented younger boys, it’s just about us trying to up-speed them as quick as possible.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionEngland would love the calm, composed Saint to be the missing piece in their midfield jigsaw and the centre Henry Slade believes the former has the ability to be an influential Test player. “He sees space really well,” Slade said. “There’s always going to be space on the field somewhere; you can’t defend everything. I feel like he sees it really well.“Obviously he’s a slightly different 10 to Marcus. Marcus has got that X‑factor in terms of beating a man one on one but I think Fin is very measured. He also speaks very well and, as I say, finds space very well. That’s a big part of a No 10’s role …moving the team around to where they need to be on the pitch. I think he’s been really good at that.“It can be tough being a younger guy coming up through. But I think the ones that do the best are the ones that really embrace it and have the confidence to speak up and show what gets them selected in the first place. And I think now, the way he speaks in meetings or when he is on the pitch, I think he feels really confident.”Wigglesworth, though, accepts that England did not help themselves in the second half against Ireland. “The penalty count did not help our ability to get out of our half and dictate what we wanted to do to Ireland,” the backs coach said. “For part of that second half it felt like we were trapped in our territory and couldn’t really get out.“We know it is going to be a big challenge [against France] but the feeling is excitement. We did some things really well in Dublin, the first half was brilliant, some of attack was really good. You have got to think positively in all situations and make sure we are clear in how we want to impose our game.”Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025England rugby union teamSteve BorthwickSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The 22-year-old was beaten 6-3, 6-4 by the former Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova to add to her losses to Iga Swiatek in the third round of the Australian Open and toCristina Bucsa in Singapore last week.Originally given a wild card into qualifying, the British No 2 was bumped up to the main draw and handed a tricky opener against Czech Vondrousova, who has struggled with injury since last summer.Raducanu on search for coach again after Cavaday quits over health issuesRead moreRaducanu made a strong start but fell away badly during the latter stages of the opening set, while Vondrousova also edged a close second.Raducanu is travelling with fitness trainer Yutaka Nakamura afterformer coach Nick Cavaday’s decision to step downfor health reasons, but she did have another old childhood mentor, Roman Kelecic, in her corner.Kelecic is now based in Dubai but has been helping out Raducanu this week, and initially the signs were positive as she took advantage of a shaky start on serve from her opponent to move into a 3-1 lead. But a long Raducanu service game that followed proved the turning point, with Vondrousova eventually breaking and then reeling off five games in succession.Raducanu seemed to be struggling with discomfort in her neck and made a number of errors, but she regrouped at the start of the second set and applied strong pressure to the Vondrousova serve. She could not force a break, though, and was staring at defeat after dropping serve herself in the eighth game.Raducanu broke back immediately but was unable to hold her own delivery as Vondrousova clinched victory.Cameron Norrie recorded his first win of 2025 on the ATP Tour, beating seventh seed Alex Michelsen 2-6, 7-6 (1), 6-1 at the Dallas Open.Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

The suit initially sought $500m in damages.How MLS obscures the truth behind its withdrawal from the US Open CupRead moreMLS said the allegations were meritless.“The jury’s verdict confirms that this case was nothing more than an attempt by NASL to deflect blame for its own failures,” MLS said in a statement. “Since our inception in 1996, MLS has been dedicated to making the necessary investments to elevate the sport of soccer and provide an exceptional experience for players and fans.”The federation, which is the governing body for soccer in the U.S., called the jury’s decision “an important victory for the broader sports landscape.”Jeffrey Kessler, a lawyer for the NASL, said in an email that an appeal was highly likely. He said without elaborating there were fundamental errors that “prevented the jury from considering important evidence and claims.”The federation sanctions leagues in three divisions, with MLS being the top Division 1 league. The awarding of division status is based on a number of criteria including stadium seating capacity, the number of teams and the locations of those teams.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But after media coverage about a local, abusive deacon and a Pennsylvania grand jury report which established Catholic clergy abuse in that state was more widespread than previously realized, Windmann opted tospeak publiclyabout his ordeal.‘Crisis communications’: emails show how NFL’s Saints and NBA’s Pelicans helped New Orleans church spin abuse scandalRead moreAfter Jesuit’s president at the time condemned Windmann’s abuse as a “disgusting” chapter in the school’s past, he received an email from the Saints and Pelicans’ vice-president of communications, Greg Bensel.“Speaking from personal experience after 23 years with the Saints, when the media and the public attack you at your core, it takes the resolve of people like yourself to lead us to clarity,” Bensel wrote. “The church needs leaders like you, and I just wanted to reach out and say you have the support of myself, [Saints and Pelicans president] Dennis [Lauscha], and [owner Gayle] Benson.“If I can offer any counsel on any issue, I am here for you,” Bensel wrote, according to copies of the emails, which media outlets including the Guardian, WWLLouisiana, the New York Times, the Associated Press and the Washington Post obtained after they were produced in unrelated clergy abuse litigation.The Jesuit president in those days, Christopher Fronk, replied that he appreciated Bensel’s offer. Though most of the subsequent emails do not involve Fronk and Jesuit, Windmann said it was “just devastating” to learn of Bensel’s overture.“That … Greg Bensel proactively offered, for free, assistance to help Fronk with his own scandal is just devastating,” said Windmann, the founder of Survivors of Childhood Sex Abuse. “It’s very, very hard to read.”In a 2020 article in Sports Illustrated, Fronk denied ever being contacted by anyone with the Saints on the topic of clergy abuse. He has not responded to requests for comment from the Guardian and WWL Louisiana.Meanwhile, Saints and Pelicans officials have long characterized their emails withNew Orleansarchdiocese officials – including archbishop Gregory Aymond – as free public relations advice rather than a bad faith effort to shape a narrative.The Saints clergy-abuse emails: five takeaways from our investigationRead moreKevin Bourgeois, a therapist who was abused in the 1980s as a student at a New Orleans high school which primarily educated boys interested in the priesthood and later mediated an out-of-court settlement, on Monday said: “Today, I’m angry, hurt and retraumatized again.“Liars have been exposed. … I hope punishment follows.”Linda Lee Stonebreaker – who has publicly recounted being age four when a suburban New Orleans priest molested her and whose late father Steve was a member of the first-ever Saints team in 1967 – wrote the names of Aymond, Benson and Bensel on social media, along with others in the emails between the ball club and the church.“My late father – may he haunt you in your sleep,” Stonebreaker wrote.Monday’s revelations came amid an ongoing Louisiana state police investigation into the New Orleans archdiocese, in which troopers have alleged in sworn court documents that they had probable cause to believe the church ran achild-sex trafficking ringthat allowed clergymen to inflict sexual abuse on minors for decades and then covered up those crimes.About two months earlier, the 93-year-old retired priest Lawrence Heckerpleaded guiltyto child rape before receiving a mandatory life sentence and dying shortly thereafter.The archdiocese has also been struggling to resolve a federal bankruptcy protection case filed in 2020, which could cost the church hundreds of millions of dollars in payments to clergy-abuse victims.“TheNew Orleans Saintsand … Pelicans chose to stand shoulder to shoulder with Gregory Aymond to ease the harm to the church, not the harm to children,” said Kathryn Robb, the national director of the Children’s Justice Campaign at the Enough Abuse organization. “Shame on them.”Scott “Alex” Peyton, whose brother was sexually molested by a priest of the Roman Catholic diocese of Lafayette, Louisiana,saidon social media that Monday’s revelations only strengthened his belief that “there needs to be better support for survivors”.What Saints and church officials said, and what their emails sayRead morePeyton hosts the Resilience in the Shadows podcast and helps his parents lead TentMakers of Louisiana, a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting clergy molestation survivors. His father made national headlines in March 2024 after being excommunicated from the Catholic church by Lafayette bishop J Douglas Deshotel after resigning as a deacon over Alex’s brother’s abuse.“Imagine trying to fight for justice against your abuser,” Peyton said. “And on the other side is the Catholic church … and anNFLfootball team?”A statement from the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests (Snap) – which was co-signed by Peyton’s mother and the TentMakers executive director Letitia Peyton – said the revelations about the emails “signal that the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic church is more widespread and insidious than anyone could possibly imagine”.“When powerful institutions get together to hide something, the weak and vulnerable are inevitably the ones who are harmed,” Snap’s statement said.The Louisiana state house member Mandie Landry, a New Orleans Democrat, said she believed the clergy abuse scandal-related correspondence between Benson’s sports teams and the church “calls into question other decisions they make as an organization”.“The public trusts the Saints – loves the Saints,” Landry said.Explore more on these topicsNew Orleans clergy abuseNew Orleans SaintsNew Orleans PelicansNew OrleansNFLNBAUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

China’s finance ministry also announced 15% tariffs on coal and liquefied natural gas, and 10% on crude oil, farm equipment, large-displacement vehicles and pickup trucks from the US.China’s commerce ministry and its customs administration said on Tuesday that to “safeguard national security interests” the country was imposing export controls on a raft of critical minerals: tungsten, tellurium, ruthenium, molybdenum and ruthenium-related items.The commerce ministry also said it was adding the US companies PVH Group and Illumina Inc to its unreliable entity list, opening them to restrictions or penalties, without detailing what the companies were accused of. PVH is a clothing company that owns brands including Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein. Illumina is a biotech company specialising in genomic sequencing that recently partnered with Nvidia on health-related AI tech.In December, China launched an antitrust investigation into Nvidia, after a tightening of US export controls on hi-tech products popular in China. On Tuesday, the Financial Times reported that Beijing was considering adding US chipmaker Intel to the list of companies being investigated by China’s antitrust regulator. China is Intel’s largest market, and Nvidia’s second-largest after the US.Trump tariffs: which countries are affected and what does this mean?Read moreMost of Google’s services such as search and email are blocked in China. But the company still makes money in China from Chinese companies advertising overseas and from Chinese phone-makers using its Android operating system.“The unilateral imposition of tariffs by the US seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization,” China’s finance ministry said in its statement announcing the retaliatory tariffs. “It is not only unhelpful in solving its own problems, but also damages the normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the US.”Earlier, the US presidentpulled backfrom the brink of an economic conflict with Canada and Mexico, however, delaying threatened duties for another month after 11th-hour talks.For exports from China, the US has scrapped an exemption through which shipments valued at less than $800 (£644) have not faced tariffs. Popular Chinese retailers such as Shein and Temu have relied on the exemption to sell cheap goods in the US.China trade surplus chartAfter a call with Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, on Monday, Trump agreed to postpone tariffs of 25% onMexico– the latest of several delays – after she offered to send 10,000 of the country’s troops to its border with the US.Talks with Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, also prompted Trump to postpone 25% tariffs on the country.Canadais implementing a $1.3bn border plan, Trudeau said, and will appoint a fentanyl tsar, list cartels as a terrorists and “ensure 24/7 eyes on the border”.As the US readied higher tariffs on China on Monday, the White House announced that Trump would speak later this week with China’s president, Xi Jinping. Beijing earlier pledged to hit back with “countermeasures” and file a legal case against the US at the World Trade Organization.Economists have warned Trump’s tariff plans risk raising prices for millions of Americans, only weeks after he pledged, upon taking office, to “rapidly” bring them down.Addressing reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump maintained that tariffs were a “very powerful” means of strengthening the US economically and “getting everything else you want”.Every country wanted to agree a way to avoid US tariffs, the president claimed. “In all cases, they all wanna make deals.”Trump had conceded over the weekend that they could cause “a little pain” in the US. “WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!),” he wrote on social media. “BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.”The reaction in global financial markets, which had recovered some of their losses on Monday after Trump’s one-month delay, was mixed on Tuesday.In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng share index jumped by almost 2.8%, while South Korea’s Kospi rose by 1.3%. The FTSE 100 fell 31 points to 8,551 shortly after opening in London.Sterling dropped by half a cent against the US dollar to $1.24, while the euro was down a similar amount at $1.03.The Canadian dollar, which slumped to a 20-year low on Monday before rebounding, weakened – to 1.445 to the dollar.Chinese markets remain closed because of the lunar new year holiday and will reopen on Wednesday.Additional reporting by Graeme WeardenExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpChinaUS economyUS politicsMexicoCanadaEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s been anotherwildfewdaysin Elon Musk news. Stay tuned for our coverage. In personal news, I deleted Instagram from my phone to try out a month without it there. Instead of scrolling, I’ve been listening toShygirlandLady Gaga’s new music.American AI superiority?DeepSeek roiled the US stock market last week by proposing that AI shouldn’t really be all that expensive. The suggestion was so stunning it wiped about $600bn off of Nvidia’s market cap in one day. DeepSeek says it trained its flagship AI model, which topped US app stores and nearly equals the performance of the US’s top models, with just $5.6m. (How accurate that figure is has been disputed.) For a moment, it seemed like the joint announcement of Stargate, the US’s $500bn AI infrastructure project that joins Oracle, Softbank and OpenAI, would be an enormous over-commitment by people who didn’t know what they were talking about. Same with Meta and Microsoft’s enormous earmarks. Hey, big spender: investors want to see this cashflow turn the other way.Amid the mania,Metaand Microsoft, two tech giants that have staked their futures on their artificial intelligence products, reported their quarterly earnings. Each has committed to spending tens of billions of dollars next year to build out their artificial intelligence infrastructure, which each has lavished tens of billions on already. Meta has promised $60bn, Microsoft $80bn.Asked aboutDeepSeekon a call with analysts, Mark Zuckerberg rebuffed such suspicions: “I continue to think that investing very heavily in CapEx and infra is going to be a strategic advantage over time.”Satya Nadella said: “As AI becomes more efficient and accessible, we will see exponentially more demand.” Microsoft has embraced DeepSeek and made it available to Azure customers.One person’s entire fortune will live or die on the superiority of American AI:Sam Altman. He reacted to the DeepSeek mania by announcing that OpenAI would release a new version of ChatGPT with greater capabilities for free. Previously, the chatbot’s paid users, some of whom pay $200 a month, received access to its cutting-edge capabilities first. What Altman didn’t say was just as notable. He did not announce that OpenAI would reduce its enormous spending, nor did he say Stargate would need less cash. He’s just as committed as Zuckerberg and Nadella to the big bucks game.I’ll be watching Google’s earnings tonight for Sundar Pichai’s opinion on what DeepSeek means for his company and its enormous spending.AI philosophy and corporate governance take the stageView image in fullscreenPhotograph: The GuardianOn Thursday of last week, I attended the premiere ofDoomers, a new play set in the offices of OpenAI the weekend that Sam Altman was fired as CEO. I found it thought-provoking and funny, if imperfect and frustrating, and I would recommend seeing it if you can.The play occurs in two acts. In the first, Seth, the Altman analogue, sits at a long table with other company executives while they discuss what’s happened: the board has given the CEO the axe. As they talk, Altman and the company’s head of safety and alignment, Alina, grow testier with one another. Alina fears his megalomania has derailed any possibility of creating a safe AI; Seth finds her anxiety juvenile and obstructive. Myra, the stand-in for Mira Murati, who briefly took over as CEO in Altman’s stead, wants everyone to get along so the company can function. In the second act, equal in length but less interesting than the first, board members think aloud about what they’ve done with increasing regret.The play is a dramatized thought experiment that sets an unstoppable force – the barreling, multibillion-dollar progress of the AI industry – against an immovable object: the belief that AI could grow so powerful and smart it concludes that humans are no longer necessary and wipes us out. Such fears may seem like the province of a fanciful novelist, but Altman himself has saidAI could end human civilizationin an open letter co-signed by dozens of AI scientists and businesspeople.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: The GuardianThe play succeeds in personifying the opposing schools of thought, with each character representing a viewpoint in the debate. Seth wants to accelerate AI’s development as much as possible, and he wants to be the one to do it. Alina wants to slow things down enough for careful consideration of the dangers. Other characters throw punches from different angles and ally themselves with one pole of the argument or the other in configurations that may leave you wondering which side of the debate you really stand on. The ethical lines may be blurry, but playwright Matthew Gasda brings plenty of sharp zingers to this C-suite knife fight.Gasda said he interviewed AI industry players for the work, and the effort is evident in how the ideological contours of the play’s conversations mirrorAI’s real rival factions. The characters’ exchanges mirror real ones reported to have taken place in the OpenAI offices with most of the same players. Doomers may be the nearest we get to transcripts of their squabbles. One tech reporter who covered the saga and attended the premiere told me it hewed closely to the real drama.Where the play fails, however, is in plot. It does not move beyond staged philosophical colloquy. The characters do very little but pace to and fro, especially in the second act, leaving the conflict in nearly the same position as when it began. In the first half, Seth and Alina’s conflict does come to a head within their office, but that confrontation does not produce a discernible change within either character, nor do we observe what Seth does after he and the others leave. I sat through intermission with a feeling of unresolved tension that did not dissipate in the second act, when “MindMesh” board members debate taking steps to circumvent Seth’s next possible moves. They fail to act. The audience sees no result from either act’s lengthy arguments, which left me doubly frustrated because the lack of change repeated. We are left to revisit the news stories that came after that weekend, which presents an unsatisfying denouement. Altman was reinstated as CEO. He won. Helen Toner, theOpenAIboard member most associated with AI safety and Alina’s analogue, was ousted.The play’s program lists its dramaturges as ChatGPT and Claude, so it may be no surprise that it feels abstracted and mechanical. Though the characters show emotion when they make their moral points, the show as a whole lacks the human element of action based on belief. The characters argue about faith, but the holy war has already happened before the play begins. Gasdawrotethat he “saw new versions of Frankenstein” in the AI startup’s boardroom coup. The themes of hubris, fear and technical achievement at all costs are apparent and well-crafted in Doomers. The ideas are all there. What the play lacks, however, is the dire drama and movement of the global chase between Victor Frankenstein and his creation.RFK Jr, Sweetgreen, seed oils and the health conspiracy pipelineView image in fullscreenPhotograph: FOODSTUFF/AlamyMy colleague Johana Bhuiyan writes:Robert F Kennedy Jr has waged a war on quite a few things. But among his chief enemies are seed oils. According to RFK Jr, who was nominated to lead the US Department of Health and Human Services and faced bruising confirmation hearings last week, seed oils such as canola, soybean and sunflower oils are poisoning Americans. He recommends using beef tallow instead.Nutritionists say these oils are not only safe but could also have cardiovascular benefits; nonetheless, the demonization of seed oils has caught on. Health and wellness influencers on social media have touted the benefits of beef tallow, claimed seed oils were to blame for inflammation, and touted the anti-ageing and mental health benefits of quitting them. The battle against seed oils wasn’t started by RFK Jr – Eater traced it back to astudypublished seven or eight years ago – but he has given it renewed steam.Posts about seed oils are hitting the mainstream without any hint of conspiracy. If you follow anything related to health or fitness, or just spend some time on Instagram, YouTube or TikTok, you will come across a seed oil post that makes it seem like the science behind the claims is all but definitive. It’s even affected business decisions: the salad chain Sweetgreen startedmarketingits seed-oil free dressings two weeks ago.Given the conspiracy-peddling of currentTrump administrationnominees and social platforms’ move away from factchecking, it’s likely conspiracy theories will seep into the mainstream much more often. By the time those ideas hit your feeds, they’ll be stripped of all the markings of conspiracy and fed to you alongside comforting but easily debunkable science.The wider TechScapeAI tools used for child sexual abuse images targeted in Home Office crackdownA man stalked a professor for six years.

The company reported $96.5bn, compared with analyst expectations of $96.67 bn.The company surpassed investors’ expectations of $2.13 in earnings per share, however, with $2.15 in EPS.“Q4 was a strong quarter driven by our leadership in AI and momentum across the business,” Alphabet chief executive Sundar Pichai wrote in a statement. “We are building, testing, and launching products and models faster than ever, and making significant progress in compute and driving efficiencies.”The company reported $84bn in its services revenue, which includesGooglesearch and YouTube ads and $12bn in Cloud revenues, a 30% increase year over year.As competition heats up in various sectors of Alphabet’s business, analysts will be looking for more details about a wide range of topics including the company’s AI spending, its Cloud revenue, and its ability to continue to bolster its search advantage against new and existing generative AI players such as China’sDeepSeekand OpenAI.The company’s revenue slowdown reflects the “challenging year” Google has had and 2025 might be the year that it loses its competitive edge, according toEmarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf.“Although it’s still well insulated, Google’s advantages in search hinge on its ubiquity and entrenched consumer behavior,” Mitchell-Wolf said in a statement. This year “could be the year those advantages meaningfully erode as antitrust enforcement and open source AI models change the game. And Cloud’s disappointing results suggest that AI-powered momentum might be beginning to wane just as Google’s closed model strategy is called into question by DeepSeek.”Alphabet also said it plans to spend $75bn on capital expenditures in the next year, largely to build out its artificial intelligence capabilities and infrastructure.“Our results show the power of our differentiated full-stack approach to AI innovation and the continued strength of our core businesses,” Pichai wrote. “We are confident about the opportunities ahead, and to accelerate our progress, we expect to invest approximately $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2025.”Spending on building out AI infrastructure and development has continued to rise across the industry, and Alphabet is expected to be no exception. Meta said it planned to spend $65bn on AI infrastructure just in 2025. That’s partly why news of Deepseek’s AI model, which the company said they trained with just $5.6m, sparked investor panic in the US and erased $1tn from the stock market. But research firm SemiAnalysisnow estimates that DeepSeekactually spent a total of almost $1.3bn. Analysts will be looking to hear how this has impacted the way Alphabet look at its own spending and monetizing its AI search features.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

(Tech giants say yes)Read more“It will be interesting how the rising costs of AI impact Alphabet’s roadmap for AI-integrated advertising, especially in light of DeepSeek’s revelation that they may have wasted tremendous money and energy,” saidNikhil Lai, senior analystat Forrester.The company appears to also be opening the door to develop AI for more use cases, including for national security. Moments before the company reported its earnings, the company also removed its pledge not to use its AI technology for weapons, surveillance and technology that can “cause or are likely to cause overall harm”. In a blog post, Google’s head of AI, Demis Hassabis, and the company’s senior vice-president for technology and society, James Manyika,wrotethat as global competition for AI leadership increases, the company believes “democracies should lead in AI development” which are guided by “freedom, equality, and respect for human rights”.“And we believe that companies, governments, and organizations sharing these values should work together to create AI that protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security.”Analysts will also likely have questions about the Department of Justice case against the search giant, in which the tech giant suffered landmark loss. A judge found the company maintained a monopoly in general search and text advertising services. The justice department has suggested breaking up the company as a means to remedy this.China has also set its sights on Google.

On current progress in AI, he said: “We’re not talking about matching the level of humans yet. If we get a system that is as smart as a cat or a rat, that would be a victory.”However, LeCun’s fellow QEPrize winner and AI “godfather”, Yoshua Bengio, warned more progress wasneeded on the technology’s safetyand called on next week’s global AI summit in Paris to grasp the issue.“I’d like to see the leaders of this world to better understand the magnitude of what we are doing, both in terms of the power we’re creating, which could be for good or be dangerous, and the risks that come with that power,” he said.In 2018, Bengio and LeCun shared the Turing award – seen as the equivalent of a Nobel prize for computing – with Geoffrey Hinton, who was also announced as a QEPrize winner on Tuesday. The award comes after AI pioneers won two Nobel prizes last year. They included Hinton – whoshared the Nobel for physicswith another recipient of this year’s QEPrize, the US physicist John Hopfield – and the Google DeepMind scientists among thewinners of the chemistry prize.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now as prominent as the president himself, Musk has begun to make use of that power, making decisions that could affect the health of millions of people, gaining access to highly sensitive personal data, and attacking anyone who opposes him. Musk, the world’s richest man and an unelected official, has achieved an astonishing level of power over the federal government.Over the weekend, workers with Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) clashed with civil servants over demands for unfettered access to thecomputer systemsof major US government agencies in a breakneck series of confrontations. When the dust settled, several top officials who opposed the takeover had been pushed out, and Musk’s allies had gained control.Musk, with the backing of Trump, is now working to shut down theUS Agency for International Development(USAid) – the world’s largest single supplier of humanitarian aid. He bragged on Sunday about “feeding USAid into the wood chipper”. He has also targeted several other agencies in an aggressive attempt to purge and remake the federal government along ideological lines, while avoiding congressional or judicial oversight.Many of Musk’s actions have taken place without forewarning or transparency, sowing chaos and confusion among the thousands of people employed at the agencies like USAid that he has gone after. Humanitarian organizations that rely on US funding havehalted operationsand laid off staff, while government workers have been locked out of their offices. He is operating Doge as an unofficial government department with no congressionally approved mandate while he technicallyholds the positionof “special government employee”, which allows him tosidestep financial disclosuresand a public vetting process.View image in fullscreenAn employee of USAid protests outside the headquarters on Monday in Washington.Photograph: Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesMusk has gleefully posted on X, the social media platform that he owns, throughout the chaos. He has accused USAid of corruption, and of being a “criminal organization” and “radical-left political psy op”, without any evidence. Why? He tweeted an explanation of simply doing Trump’s bidding: “All @DOGE did was check to see which federal organizations were violating the @POTUS executive orders the most. Turned out to be USAID, so that became our focus.” He said it was “time for it to die”.Musk also suggested that opposition to his team will be punished, reposting a letter sent to him from the Trump-appointed federal prosecutor for Washington DC, who vowed to “pursue any and all legal action against anyone who impedes your work or threatens your people”.‘It’s been madness’: US federal workers reeling over Trump-Musk takeoverRead moreThe New York Democratic senator Chuck Schumer wrote on Tuesday morning: “An unelected shadow government is conducting a hostile takeover of the federal government. DOGE is not a real government agency. DOGE has no authority to shut programs down or to ignore federal law.” Musk responded that the reaction was “hysterical”.As other Democrats and government oversight groups began to respond to the breakneck series of actions from Musk’s team, on Tuesday the Tesla and SpaceX CEO continued to plow ahead with his cuts and told his supporters: “We’re never going to get another chance like this.”Musk takes over federal agenciesImmediately following Trump’s inauguration on 20 January, the president issued an executive order establishing Musk’s “department of government efficiency”. Rather than create an entirely new entity, the order renamed the US Digital Service, which was previously tasked with updating government IT systems, and brought the rechristened bureau into the executive office of the president.Government accountability groups instantly saw red flags with its creation, filingfour separate lawsuitsthat alleged Doge violated federal transparency laws while warning that the initiative was “slated to dictate federal policy in ways that will affect millions of Americans”.The concerns from watchdog organizations have borne out. Musk and employees of Doge have gained access to sensitive government systems in the treasury department and USAid in recent days, as well as exerted control over the office of personnel management (OPM) and theGeneral Services Administration, which handles federal real estate, with the goal of ending office leases. Two federal workers additionally sued on Tuesday for a temporary restraining order against Doge for allegedly operating an illegal server in OPM.View image in fullscreenProtesters gather outside of the office of personnel management headquarters in Washington DC on Monday.Photograph: Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesAttempts at blocking Musk’s team have resulted in several top agency officials being ousted. On Friday, the treasury department’s acting secretary, David Lebryk, resigned after refusing to grant Musk’s team access tohighly secure systemsthat control about $6tn in annual payments to millions of Americans. The next day, two senior security officials at USAid attempted tostop Doge workersfrom gaining physical access to restricted areas at the agency – resulting in a standoff in which a deputy for Musk threatened to call the US marshals. Both security officials have subsequently been put on administrative leave, and on Sunday night staff at USAid received emails telling them to not come into work the next day.The events unfolded swiftly and took place mostly outside of working hours, creating uncertainty over the weekend as to who was in charge and what authority the Doge team possessed. Many of the Doge team tasked with carrying out the overhauls of government agencies appear to have little to no experience in government and are extremely young. One of the engineers is as young as 19,Wiredreported, while a 25-year-old who previously worked at two of Musk’s companies gained access to treasury department payment systems.TheTrump administrationhas maintained that all Musk’s actions have been legal and did not violate security protocols, although the details of what Doge employees are doing with access to government systems is still unclear. “No classified material was accessed without proper security clearances,” Katie Miller, a Doge spokesperson and wife of the far-right Trump administration official Stephen Miller, wrote on X.Musk has claimed that his actions are cutting unnecessary costs and will allow for more efficient government, but he has also suggested his taskforce is ideologically opposed to liberal initiatives such as refugee services and the promotion of trans rights. He has routinely engaged with far-right and conspiracy theory-promoting accounts on X while touting his dismantling of USAid, an agency that has become a target in recent years among hardline conservatives. The far-right Heritage Foundation thinktank specifically called for reforming USAid in itscontroversial Project 2025 report, accusing it of spreading “climate extremism” and “gender radicalism”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As backlash swelled and Democrats issued calls for action against Musk on Monday, Trump attempted to assuage some of the concerns and reassert that he was in charge.“Elon can’t do and won’t do anything without our approval,” Trump said in the Oval Office. “We’ll give him approval where appropriate and where not appropriate we won’t.”But there have been no public signs thus far that Trump has reined in Musk’s ambitions or prevented him from engaging in potential conflicts –he has many, as a number of his companies do extensive work with government agencies he now holds sway over. Several of Trump’s recent policy announcements also appeared to align with Musk’s worldview and personal grievances.View image in fullscreenElon Musk and Donald Trump at a rally before the inauguration.Photograph: Alex Brandon/APTrump declared on Monday that he would shut down all aid to South Africa,Musk’s country of birth, over what he alleged was a “massive human rights violation” in the form ofa new land rights law. Musk has repeatedly accused the South African government of racism against white people and falsely claimed that the government is allowing a “genocide” against white farmers.Anotherexecutive orderfrom Trump on 31 January vowed to “unleash prosperity through deregulation” and declared that whenever a government agency issues a new regulation it must first remove 10 existing regulations. The order has echoed Musk’s longstanding calls for widespread deregulation of the federal government, which Musk reiterated in a livestream on Monday night on X,when he stated“regulations, basically, should be default gone”. He described the current administration as “our best shot” at this deregulation and “the best hand of cards we’re ever going to have”.Musk has made sweeping and aggressive declarations about what else must change about the US government, indicating where he might strike next. He stated on Monday: “Activist judges must be removed from the bench or there is no justice,” and praised the representative Marjorie Taylor Greene forissuing calls for NPR and PBSto testify at a hearing about their operations. Greene, who is head of a “delivering on government efficiency” group within the House oversight committee that aims to support Musk’s efforts, accused the public media organizations of ideological bias – citing a PBS report that Musk “gave what appeared to be a fascist salute” during a speech last month.It is uncertain what mechanisms may prevent further cuts by Musk. His immense influence coupled with his erratic behavior have made it difficult to quickly ascertain where the next axe may fall, such as on Monday when Muskclaimed that a government agencythat worked on a free IRS tax filing system was “deleted” while giving no further information. The agency’s program was still online as of Tuesday.What is clear from Musk’s public statements is the intent to barrel ahead with accumulating more power over government agencies, while framing his crusade as an existential fight for the future of the country.“It’s now or never,” the billionaire tweeted on Tuesday. “Your support is crucial to the success of the revolution of the people.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationElon MuskUS politicsDonald TrumpUS domestic policynewsShareReuse this content"

Her task is simply to waste the time of the people who are trying to scam her.O2 rolled out “AI granny” Daisy for a short period to show what could be done with artificial intelligence to counter the scourge of scammers who have become so ubiquitous.Using a mixture of ambivalence, confusion about how computers work and an eagerness to reminisce about her younger days, the “78 years young” Daisy draws sighs and snapping from fraudsters on the other end of the line.In one call O2 released, a scammer tries to take control of her computer after telling her it is riddled with viruses. He is kept on the line while she looks for her glasses and bumbles about trying to turn the machine on and find the Internet Explorer icon.3:26'I'm a bit lost now': Daisy the AI bot speaks to scammer – video“You know, back in my day we didn’t have all this technology. Everything was much simpler. What about you, dear?” she says. When he reacts with anger, saying that her “profession is bothering people”, Daisy says: “I wouldn’t want to bother anyone. I’m just trying to have a little chat.”Another call has a scammer again trying to take control of her computer, but Daisy delays by talking about how she usually just uses it for knitting patterns and recipes for scones. “I see a lot of options, dear. It says things like back, forward, reload and, oh, what’s this? Save as. How do I find the homepage?” she asks.When a third scammer tries to get her to download the Google Play Store, she replies: “Dear, did you say pastry? I’m not really on the right page.” She then complains that her screen has gone blank, saying it has “gone black like the night sky”.“If you are wasting our time, ma’am, you are going to lose your money because someone is trying to take your money and we are trying to upgrade your security,” says the exasperated scammer.View image in fullscreen‘Do you have any lovely pastries in your area? I do adore a good scone.’Photograph: Islandstock/AlamyWhen she tries to find the icon the scammer is asking her to press, she says: “I see a triangle icon, but I’m not sure if it’s the right one. It could be a slice of pie. You know, my eyesight isn’t what it used to be. Let me just squint at it.”“Do you have any lovely pastries in your area? I do adore a good scone,” she adds.Behind the affable “hoping to” is an AI system which has been trained on real scam calls, said Virgin Media O2’s marketing director, Simon Valcarcel.“It knows exactly the tactics to look out for, exactly the type of information to give to keep the scammers online and waste time,” he said.The company worked with Jim Browning, a “scam baiter” whoposts videos of himselfwasting the time of criminals, to plant phone numbers on websites where they were likely to be found by fraudsters hoping to scam people. They included sites promoting competitions where the prizes appear “too good to be true”.They then waited for the scam calls to start coming in – and, sure enough, after a few days they did. The results were then recorded on a laptop.Over a few weeks, Daisy wasted each fraudster’s time for up to 40 minutes when they could otherwise have been scamming real people.Rather than be rolled out on a much wider scale, however, Valcarcel said the project was aimed at raising awareness. Some of the scammers eventually guessed they were talking to an AI bot, but future versions could use many different types of accent and persona for Daisy.Many fraudsters work in call centres, and if one has no luck in getting information from their victim, their details will be passed on to another, according to findings from the project. In one case, Daisy was passed between four different callers.Artificial intelligence is being used to combat fraud across many industries now, according to Serpil Hall at Celebrus, a technology firm that deals with fraud and scams.It is used in banking to identify unauthorised transactions and identity fraud, in insurance to verify claims, in travel to monitor unusual booking patterns and in public services to identify things such as anomalies in tax filings, she said.Explore more on these topicsScamsConsumer affairsArtificial intelligence (AI)featuresShareReuse this content"

She uses the Chinese online marketplace to buy crafting supplies for her purse-making hobby. “You can get purse detailing and hardware for cents and pennies,” said Armacost, who is 24 and lives in New York. She says it seems like “basically everything” in her apartment comes from Temu.Donald Trump’s 10% tariff on China-made goodssold to the US, which went into effect early on Tuesday morning, might change her shopping habits.Thetariffcloses off a trade loophole that allowed fast-fashion companies like Temu andSheinto ship packages under $800 into the US duty free; this loophole, called “de minimus” has beencriticizedby both political parties in recent years. On Tuesday, Reutersreportedthat Shein and Temu are now likely to raise prices, as is Amazon’s Haul, a new e-commerce app that imports products from China-based sellers.Shoppers are concerned the tariff will get in the way of their retail therapy.“Trying to get that last Temu order in before Trump puts another tariff onChina,” Armacost, who works in consulting and also makes comedy videos on TikTok, captioned a post on Monday that shows her frantically typing on a computer, hacker movie-style. It was mostly a joke, but she has friends who made one final Temu run. “My friend Piper got a ton of apartment stuff during a last-minute tariff haul,” she said.View image in fullscreenVivi Armacost has friends who made a final Temu run.Photograph: Tiktok user @viviarmacostTemu – which surpassed Amazon as the most-downloaded shopping app in 2023 – andSheinare beloved by both the overly trendy and the obsessively thrifty. While Shein is known primarily for clothing, Temu also sells makeup, home goods and decor. These products are cheap – just over $4 for a pair of women’s sneakers on Temu, or $1.45 for bracelet on Temu – but of dubious quality. Inevitably, many end up in landfills.“A lot of the stuff comes actually way smaller than you expect,” Armacost said. “I bought a desk lamp, except it can fit in my hands.”In the months before Trump took office, shoppers urged each other to stock up on Temu and Shein, in case the new administration followed through on its promise to tax US trade partners. “Kinda feeling emo bc this may be the last good Black Friday for a while because of the tariffs,” one TikTok user wrote in aclip. “Better collect your ‘vintage Shein’ because they will probably go for $100 next year.’”Two days after the election, the fashion writer Amy Odellwarned readersof price hikes in a post to her BackRow Substack titled: “Trump Won. So Shop Now.” Susan Scafidi, a lawyer and founder of Fordham’s Fashion Law Institute, told Odell: “Everything’s going to be more expensive, which is a little crazy when you realize that a lot of the Trump appeal was with regard to the economy.”Could the tariff kill fast fashion, an industry defined by wasteful over-consumption, as we know it? No, says Margaret Bishop, a textile and apparel specialist and professor at New York’s Parsons School of Design and the Fashion Institute of Technology. “If anything, I think these tariffs will strengthen fast fashion’s hold on customers,” she said. “If everything costs more, particularly food, transportation and housing, they’re going to have to cut back somewhere.“Americans have a real hunger for new fashion, so they will trade down to be able to continue to buy things. If a $1 pack of T-shirts at Temu becomes $2 a pack, that’s still cheaper than spending $20 for a couple of T-shirts that are better made,” she continued.Sheng Lu, a professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware, agreed that tariffs would not “fundamentally shift” Americans’ love of a good, if sketchy, deal. While small businesses will bear most of the pain from tariffs – due to supply chain snarls or the fact that Americans won’t be able to spend as much – larger corporations such as Shein and Temu tend to absorb costs.“These companies are resourceful,” Lu said. “My more immediate concern is that small and medium-sized enterprises won’t survive, or will face significant challenges.”Big tech to tungsten: what industries are the focus of China’s new US tariffs?Read moreIn 2023, a US congressionalreportalleged that there was an “extremely high risk” that Temu used forced labor in its supply chain, and that both Shein and Temu evaded US human rights reviews. (Shein denied these claims at the time, while Temu did not comment on the report.) A recentreportfrom the Swiss advocacy group Public Eye found that some Shein workers endure 75-hour work weeks. (Shein told the BBC it was “working hard” to address the issues raised in the report.)The fast-fashion industry is alsosynonymouswith high carbon emissions and pollution.Lu fears that tariffs will exacerbate these issues. “If they have to pay more on tariff duties but at the same time make their prices competitive, that’s not good news for workers or the environmental impact, because companies will have more incentive to cut corners,” he said.Armacost knows that these e-commerce giants represent the worst of Americans’ desire for excess. “But also, at the same time, spendingdoesstimulate the economy,” she said. “In response to the idea that it’s a good thing if people stop ordering so much random stuff, I say: ‘What’s the point of living in a country if I can’t order 100 pieces of junk for $15?’”Explore more on these topicsE-commerceDonald TrumpChinaSheinfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Sunday night, the rapper Kanye West and his wife, the Australian former model and “Yeezy” brand architectural designer Bianca Censori, appeared at the Grammy awards. West wore black sunglasses; Censori wore basically nothing. In a stunt for the cameras, West posed behind Censori as she turned her back to the paparazzi and lowered a long fur coat down her shoulders. When she turned to face the photographers, she was wearing a fully transparent mini dress, and no underwear. The effect was that she appeared completely nude. According toPage Six, the pair were “escorted out” following the incident, though others claim that the couple left of their own accord. West, after all, was only nominally a contender for a Grammy this year: he was nominated in just one category, best rap song, for Carnival, his collaboration with Ty Dolla $ign. He ultimately lost, but he didn’t come to the Grammy awards expecting to win. What he wanted out of his attendance was what he got when Censori dropped her coat.The clothing, or rather lack thereof, is typical of Censori in her appearances with West. Since the pair married in early 2023 – shortly after West finalized his divorce from reality star Kim Kardashian – Censori has rarely been seen without West, and rarely wearing clothes. On a2024 tripto a restaurant in Los Angeles, she wore a sheer flesh-colored bodysuit with long sleeves but no coverage over her breasts; that same summer, at the Chateau Marmont, she wore thong underwearwithout any pants; on a trip to the movies, she wore a sheer crop top with no bra, and a pair of shorts so short, they tipped into thegenre of briefs. The effect of her nudity and near-nudity is heightened by the proximity of Kanye West, her husband, who is usually wearing too much clothing beside Censori’s too little: long pants, long sleeves, high necks, and layers of jackers, sweatshirts, and ponchos, often combined with a beard and dark sunglasses that conceal his face.It’s Emperor Kanye and his ‘chief architect’ – guess which one wasn’t wearing any clothes? | Marina HydeRead moreRisque fashion is a tradition of its own, and the bodies of celebrity women are offered up for exposure and visual consumption in a kind of conventional ritual that often carried its own critique. In terms of sheer exposure, Censori’s “outfit”, as it were, at the 2025 Grammys is not so different from Rihanna’s famous sparkly-sheerflapper-inspired numberfrom the 2014 Council of Fashion Designers of America awards. And yet Censori’s habit of nudity is darker, less playful, and not just because it declines to partake of the coquettish ritual of faux-concealment that is typical of so much other revealing fashion – and, indeed, of celebrity itself.There is a clear desire to shock in her appearances with West, but there is no playfulness. In vain one scans the photos of Censori in search of a smile, a twinkle in her eye, a sign of conspiratorial pleasure, or of being in on the joke, or even of mere willingness. One sees only the blankness of her expression, vacant and somewhat sad. Writing in the New Yorker,Naomi Frycalled her a “pure, mute spectacle of flesh”.The exposure of Censori’s body is contrasted with the enigma of her mind. Officially speaking, no one knows what she thinks of her own public nudity, or of her relationship with West – or of anything at all, for that matter, since she never talks. West, however, is somewhat less of a mystery. Around the time of his messy divorce from Kardashian, with whom he shares four children, West’s behavior became erratic. He launched a half-hearted run for president before endorsing Donald Trump; he praised Hitler and tweeted that he would “go death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE”.This public behavior was allegedly paired with increasingly disturbing private actions, especially concerning sex and women. Back before he lost his partnership with Adidas, he showed executives there pornographic videos on his phoneduring a meeting. He is being sued by at least two women for sexual assault. One, amodel for a music videothat West worked on, says that he strangled her and shoved his fingers in her mouth during a music video shoot at New York City’s Chelsea hotel in 2010, allegedly yelling “This is art, this is fucking art,” during the attack. Another, his former assistant, accuses West of sexually assaulting her on multiple occasions, including one incident in which she claims that West drugged her in the presence of the rapper and accused sex traffickerSean “Diddy” Combs. West has called the allegations “baseless”.As for Censori, her mother came to California from Australia not long after the marriage,reportedlybecause she was concerned about her daughter. On one of the visits,accordingto West’s former assistant, West told Censori that he wanted to have sex with Censori’s mother and to make Censori watch.It would be generous – and easier on our consciences – to imagine Censori and West partaking, together, in a critique of gender and celebrity. In this version of events, what West is doing when he stands behind Censori and watches her undress for paparazzi photographers is not using her degradation and vulnerability as proof of his status, but indicting us, the viewer.His vampiric consumption of her body becomes ours: the brutal depiction of heterosexuality as a practice of domination and value extraction is shown to be the same as the practice of celebrity and its consumption. But if that critique is contained in West and Censori’s spectacle, it may be we, not them, who puts it there. Censori’s consent and knowingness is not, actually, in evidence here; and even if it was, consent exists, often, even in situations of asymmetry and violence, even in situations where great harm is being done. Critiquing Censori as an artist allows us to see her differently, as something more hopeful and complicated than a victim of brutality. But sometimes things are what they look like.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsKanye WestOpinionGrammy awards 2025GrammyscommentShareReuse this content"

Their grudging experiment with limited democracy reached its end when Aung San Suu Kyi’s party won a landslide second election victory – prompting the ousting and imprisonment of the National League for Democracy (NLD) leader and her colleagues in February 2021.Four years on, resistance has flourished. A study by the BBCestimatesthat the junta controls only 21% of Myanmar’s territory as it battles People’s Defence Force units set up by the national unity government formed from the NLD’s remnants, as well as the ethnic armed groups that have long fought Naypyidaw. More than 4 million people are displaced and half the population has been forced into poverty. Less than half has access to electricity. The UNsaysRakhine state is at imminent risk of acute famine and Rohingya Muslims there are particularly vulnerable,trappedbetween the military – which hasforcibly conscriptedmen – and the Arakan Army, which accuses them of siding with the junta.The military still holds the major cities and the country’s heart. Itwill not be dislodged easily. But internal tensions are evident, with calls for its chief, Min Aung Hlaing, to quit. Among its losses are 95 towns, key trade routes, hundreds of military bases and two regional commands. Itsbrutal tacticsinclude sexual violence, mass killings and torture, as well as the relentless bombing of civilian sites. Any possibility of further restricting jet fuel supplies should be seized on.Astonishing rebel advances from late October 2023 were possible because China gave the nod to an alliance of ethnic armed groups, angered by the regime’s failure to control criminal groups on the border. Now it has cut off arms flows and other key imports, seeingthe junta’s survivalas its best hope of ensuring the resources and stability it seeks and of keeping out the US. Tellingly, it seems to be Beijing pressing hardest for elections this year. They would not only be a sham – with 21,000 political prisoners being held – but also farcical, if they are even achievable; opposition forces have pledged to disrupt them.Many in Myanmar have concluded that military rule is no longer an inevitability and that they cannot compromise with the junta, because it has shown it will not compromise with them. But even optimists acknowledge that it could take years to defeat it. There is concern that, with so many other crises worldwide, the international community could seize on token concessions by the junta and press for a deal.The Trump administration’s attacks on the National Endowment for Democracy are bad news for the civic groups that are aiding people now and that would be key to building a better Myanmar. Its freeze on USAid operations has already seenmedical care withdrawnfrom 100,000 refugees in Thailand. A modest UKincrease in healthcare fundingis welcome, and the EU and others should beef up aid, working withemerging administrationsin areas wrested from the military.Fears that a post-junta Myanmar could collapse completely, at further civilian cost, are not unfounded. Opposition groups too have committedgrave rights violations. They are deeply fragmented, with diverse and sometimes contradictory interests. Yet they have managed to cooperate surprisingly over the last four years. A different,federalvision for the country cannot and should not be written off.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Trump increases his power bydemonstratinghe has the power and is willing to use it.The same with deporting, say, Colombians in military planes, handcuffed and shackled. Trump says, without any basis in fact, that they’re criminals.If Colombia complains about their treatment, so much the better. Trump threatens tariffs. Colombia backs down, and Trump has once again demonstrated his power.Why did Trump stop foreign aid? Not because it’s wasteful. In fact, it helps stabilize the world and reduces the spread of communicable diseases. The real reason Trump stopped foreign aid is he wants to show hecan.Why is he disregarding or threatening to tear up treaties and agreements (the Paris agreement, Nato, whatever)? Not because such treaties and agreements are bad for America. To the contrary, they’re in the US’s best interest.The reason Trump is tearing them up is they tie Trump’s hands and thereby limit his discretion to dish out punishments and rewards.Don’t think of these as individual “policies”. Think of them together as demonstrations of Trump’s strength.If he doesn’t reach a deal with Canada or Mexico over the next 30 days and one or both retaliate against US-imposed tariffs with their own tariffs on US exports, he’ll retaliate against them with even bigger tariffs.If some senior Republican members of Congress object that he’s stepping on congressional prerogatives, so what? It’s an opportunity to show them who’s boss.If a federal court temporarily stops him, so what? He’ll go right on doing it and demonstrate that the courts are powerless to stop him.Look behind what’s happening, and you’ll see Trump employing two techniques to gain more power than any US president has ever wielded.The first is to demonstrate that he can mete out huge punishments and rewards.It doesn’t matter if the punishment or reward is justified. A 25% tariff onCanada?Hello?It’s a demonstration of strength.If prices jump in the US for oil and lumber from Canada or for fruits and vegetables from Mexico, no problem for Trump. Most Americans don’t understand how tariffs work, anyway. Trump will blame Canada and Mexico. And then threaten them with, say, 50% tariffs. Kaboom!Which brings us to the second technique Trump is using to expand his power:unpredictability.What makes an abusive parent or spouse, or an abusive dictator, or Trump, especially terrifying? They’re unpredictable. They lash out in ways that are hard to anticipate.So, anyone potentially affected by their actions gives them extra-wide berth – vast amounts of obedience in advance.Trump keeps everyone guessing.He demands Denmark sell Greenland to the United States. He chews out the CEO of the Bank of America at Davos for allegedly discriminating against conservatives. He attacks birthright citizenship.What’s next? Who knows? That’s the wholepoint.How else to explain the bizarre deference – cowardice – we’re seeing among CEOs, the media, almost all Republican and even some Democratic lawmakers? Presumably, they’re all saying to themselves: “He could doanything,so let’s beespeciallycareful.”In 1517, Niccolò Machiavelli argued that sometimes it is “a very wise thing to simulate madness”.The “rule of law” is all about predictability. We need predictability to be free.But much of what Trump is doing is probably either illegal yet would require months or years before the US supreme court decides so, or is in the gray area of “probably illegal but untested by the courts”. Which suits his strategy just fine.The media calls it “chaos”, which is how various people and institutions experience it.The practical consequence is that an increasing number of so-called “leaders” – in the private, public and non-profit sectors, and around the world – are telling their boards, overseers, trustees or legislatures: “We have to give Trump whatever he wants and even try to anticipate his wants, because who knows how he’ll react if we don’t?”Together, these two techniques – big demonstrations of discretionary power to reward or punish, and wild uncertainty about when or how he’ll do so – expand Trump’s power beyond the point any president has ever pushed it.Which brings us to the obvious question: why is Trump so obsessed with enlarging his power?Hint: it’s not about improving the wellbeing of average Americans and certainly not about making America great again (whatever that means).True, he’s a malignant narcissist and sadist with an insatiable lust for power who gets pleasure out of making others squirm.But there’s something else.The bigger his demonstrable power and the more unpredictably he wields it, the greater his ability totradesome of that power with people with huge amounts of wealth, both in the United States and elsewhere.I’m referring to America’s billionaires, such as Elon Musk and the 13 other billionaires Trump has installed in his regime, as well as the 744 other billionaires in the US, and the 9,850 Americans with at least $100m in net worth.Together, these individuals have a huge storehouse of wealth. Many are willing to trade some of it to gain even more, and to tie down what they have more securely.They give Trump (and his family) business deals, information, campaign money and positive PR (propaganda). In return, he gives them tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and suspensions of antitrust.I’m also referring to oligarchs in Russia,Chinaand Saudi Arabia. He gives them special trade deals, energy deals, intelligence deals, access to global deposits of riches;orhe threatens to hold them back. In return, they give him (and his family) business deals, information, support in political campaignsand more covert propaganda.This is Trump’s game: huge demonstrations of power, wielded unpredictably. They’re eliciting extraordinary deals for Trump and his family, domestically and worldwide.Trump says he’s doing this for American workers. Nothing could be farther from the truth. He’s doing this for himself and for the world’s oligarchy, which, in turn, is busily siphoning off the wealth of the world.How to stop this? The first step is to understand it.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few and The Common Good.

Then he got down to business, naming his always-prime suspect, after “illegal aliens”: diversity, equity and inclusion.“We must have only the highest standards for those who work in our aviation system,” Trump proclaimed. Obama’s standards were “very mediocre”; Biden’s, “lower than ever before”. Whereas Trump “put safety first, Obama, Biden and the Democrats put policy first”. Which policies exactly? “They put a big push to put diversity into the [Federal Aviation Administration’s] program.”“They like to do things, and they like to take them too far,” he went on, “and this is sometimes what ends up happening.”DEI is a capacious euphemism. In the right’s parlance, it stands not for the policy or program but for the Americans the policy serves: people of color, queer people, women and people with disabilities. It stands for the people it did not serve, those unqualified “DEI hires” whisked to high places through government-endowed privilege:VP Kamala Harris, thesupreme court justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, and – we can infer from Trump’s current philippic – the gay former transportation secretary,Pete Buttigieg. In Trumpian terms, DEI stands for those who deserve retribution for perpetrating the crises he invents in order to justify retribution against those he claims to have perpetrated them: border invasion, energy shortages,military unreadiness, and, now, aviation disasters.So when Trump indicts a thing called DEI for the deaths of 67 people, a deaf dog could hear the whistle. But the mainstream press, having decided to go easier on DJT this time around, played along.“Trump Blames DEI and Biden for Crash Under His Watch,” said theNew York Times.“Trump sparks outcry with implication that DEI policies are at fault in DC midair collision,”NBC Newsput it.The Washington Post went a courageous step further: “Trumpbaselesslyblames diversity program for fatal air collision.”AndReuters: “Trump takes aim, without evidence, at diversity policies over midair collision.”At the press conference, reporters crafted their own euphemisms, dignifying the whole nasty diatribe as if it contained a plausible theory of culpability. “Mr President,” asked one, “you have today blamed thediversity elements, but then told us that you weren’t sure that the controllers made any mistake. You then said perhaps the helicopter pilots were the ones who made the mistake.”Trump: “Yeah. It’s all under investigation.”This, and other obfuscations, diversions and self-contradictions, triggered the next round of revelation: “Trump Acknowledges He Doesn’t Have Evidence DEI Caused DC Plane Crash,” pronouncedNewsweek.Factcheckers set about seeking substantiation or refutation of Trump’s “facts”. No, the FAAdoes not hire blind and deaf air traffic controllers, the factcheckers found. No, DEI does not cause aircraft to collide midair. “Experts could not cite a known instance of a plane crash in which diversity efforts had been cited as the sole cause,” theTimesreassured.It’s worth noting that Trump is not targeting all DEI hires this time. He’s going after crips. It’s not the first time, or the first time the press has given him the benefit of the doubt. “Trump appears to mock disabled reporter,”NBCreported on his mimicry of the reporter Serge Kovaleski’s chronic joint condition at a campaign rally in 2015 – a performance, recorded on video, that the candidate subsequently denied.At the post-crash briefing on Thursday, the president took pains to recite the list of disabilities named on the FAA’s website, which federal anti-discrimination law calls “targeted disabilities”, a subcategory of protected classes. “‘Targeted disabilities are those disabilities at the federal government as a matter of policy, as identified for special emphasis in recruitment and hiring,” Trump read in his characteristic mafia extortionist’sdrone,emphasizing each disability with a note of astonished distaste. “They include hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, epilepsy, severe intellectual disability, psychiatric disability and dwarfism.”He continued: “The initiative is part of the FAA’s diversity and inclusion hiring plan. Think of that.” He gazed sideways, thoughtfully. “The initiative is part of the FAA’s diversity and inclusion hiring plan, which says diversity is integral to achieving FAA’s mission of ensuring safe and efficient travel. I don’t think so. I don’t think so. I think it’s just the opposite.”That evening, the Fox News host Jesse Wattersclarifiedwhat Trump was getting at. “A lot of people hear ‘DEI’, you think Black,” he said. “No.” The FAA was “trying to set quotas for people who are deaf to get jobs, people who are dwarves to get jobs, people with transgender issues to get jobs”.Ever decorous, theTimescommented: “Mr Trump’s instant focus on diversity reflected his instinct to frame major events through his political or ideological lens.”Trump has no ideology. Ideology contains ideas, and Trump does not traffic in ideas. He mobilizes feelings. The feelings he is mobilizing after 67 bodies fell into the Potomac River go beyond resentment and anxiety among those putatively more qualified white, able-bodied men who believe they have lost jobs to the blind and deviant. Normalizing vilification,making bigotry chic and fun, Trump has disinhibited even his critics to dip their toes in the slime. Publications from theIrish Starto theDaily Beastpicked up on the “dwarves” thing. Because, you know, little people – the term people with dwarfism prefer – are funny.Both exaggerating the power and diminishing the humanity of his chosen scapegoats and pariahs, Donald Trump renders the vulnerable more vulnerable not just to exclusion, but more and more, to violence. The press can’t let that slide.Judith Levine is a Brooklyn journalist and essayist, a contributing writer to the Intercept and the author of five booksExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Yet sickle cell was barely mentioned, despite it being the fastest-growing genetic disease in the UK.During the pandemic, we were constantly told that those with underlying health conditions were more at risk. But sickle cell was rarely, if ever, acknowledged as one of those conditions.Sickle cell disease– which predominantly affects black people – causes red blood cells to become a sickle shape, making it difficult for them to pass through blood vessels. This leads to excruciating pain episodes, known as sickle cell crises, which can last hours, days or even weeks.But now there are shoots of hope that maybe that tide is turning. The NHS has recently approved agroundbreaking gene therapy for sickle cell disease– a treatment that won’t just help patients manage symptoms but could cure them of this crippling illness altogether. This new treatment is being hailed as a historic moment in medical history. And for good reason.Sickle cell affects people’s everyday lives in ways many of us never have to think about – something as simple as a change in temperature can trigger a crisis. Extreme weather conditions – being too cold or too hot – can send a patient into agonising pain. Cold weather narrows blood vessels, increasing the chances of a crisis, while extreme heat can lead to dehydration, worsening sickle cell symptoms. Many of us take these seasonal shifts for granted, but for sickle cell sufferers, winter and summer can be dangerous. Even something as routine as booking a holiday requires careful planning. What happens if you have a crisis abroad, in a country where language barriers make it hard to explain your condition? Or where doctors aren’t familiar with sickle cell and don’t know how to treat it properly?Then there’s the workplace. Some people hide their condition from employers, fearing it will affect their chances of getting hired. And let’s not forget how sickle cell can even restrict who you can date and build a family with, as carriers and those with the full-blown disease have to consider the risk of passing it on to their children. For me, as a carrier, there was a sense of relief in knowing that my husband doesn’t have the sickle cell gene. This meant there was no chance of our children having the disease – the only possibility was that, like me, they would be carriers, which they both are. This gene therapy could eradicate these problems.This medical breakthrough for sickle cell also represents something bigger for black people. Yes, black people have been living with sickle cell for decades, yet the medical system’s response has been shockingly slow. Unlike other conditions that receive extensive research funding and high-profile campaigns, sickle cell has always felt like an afterthought. And let’s not pretend that race doesn’t play a role in that. Black people have worse health outcomes across the board – frommental healthtomaternity care. Add in the fictitious and sometimes fatal belief among healthcare staff that black people have ahigher pain threshold, and it becomes clearer why sickle cell has been so low on the list of medical priorities.But does investment in this treatment signal a new dawn for the treatment of black patients? Perhaps. There is no doubt that the announcement of this new treatment for sickle cell has the potential to be a monumental step forward. But it also raises important questions and concerns. This treatment will only be truly effective if the healthcare system ensures thatracial biasesno longer prevent black people from accessing the medical care they deserve.While we can’t deny the potential of this gene therapy, it is vital the people who need it will be able to have access to it. We know there is a higher concentration of black people living in London. Most sickle cell treatment centres are in London and other big cities – so what happens to those outside these areas? Will they face longer waiting times? If so, while this treatment is curing some, others will be left falling further behind simply because of where they live.Furthermore, medical innovations need consistent funding. My hope is that the NHS remains committed to funding this life-changing gene therapy – and that financial pressures don’t lead to cuts before it reaches all who need it. For now, the approval of gene therapy brings hope. But the real test will be whether it delivers on its promise.Tobi Oredein is a journalist, public speaker and the founder and CEO of Black BalladDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Toughen up – and embrace povertyVan BadhamDon’t give in to moral panic, fellas! Here are some tips from my own bumpy literary journeyTue 4 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2025 16.46 ESTShareIf you really want to make a name for yourself, publish comment insisting you’ve been silenced.It happened again last week in a nationwide publication. Under a byline accompanied by a headshot and the covers of two of his books, an Australian author counted himself among those writers deemed “pale, stale and male” by the publishing industry, who “seem to have become cancelled because of our age”.It’s a trope repeated so many times, it would be generous to describe it as cliche. Typical of the genre, evidence of discrimination is unburdened by statistics beyond the author’s disappointment that only one of six shortlistees in this year’s Booker prize is a dude.It’s a missed trick. Stats surrounding gender representation in publishing perhaps gives authors – pale, male, stale or indifferent – channels for meaningful activism beyond seeking validation from notoriously fickle newspaper readers. In a world where fostering a false sense of cultural displacement is a trickcynically employedby sly political manipulators, practical solutions are perhaps of some value.‘It will be dire for readers’: the disappearing voices of Australia’s independent publishersRead moreI shan’t name the author; the oeuvre of such pieces is to be indistinguishable. It’s some literary achievement, given the ubiquity seems to transcend theboundaries of nation, if not demographics.Besides, I’m not here to bury the man but to help him, sharing the below strategies acquired on the bumpy journey of my own literary career. I’m committed to building a culture of excellence that looks like Australia. I can only presume that’s the shared goal?1. Change your nameIf you’re concerned your work is pre-invalidated by a gender prejudice, I personally recommend neutralising your name ahead of any literary submission. Back when I was Vanessa Badham, my theatrical interest in class politics, terrorism and macroeconomics didn’t open many doors. Within a year of adopting my dad’s nickname for me as professional moniker, the same plays were on stages all over the world – once, fabulously, with a letter saying how great it was to see a young man take on these subjects. Very affirming! Many times I’ve wondered that if I had’ve eschewed a headshot on this column, I may have sourced responses more constructive to my writing practice than the somewhat gendered “shut up, you fat witch” I got yesterday. Which brings me to …2. Toughen up!I understand how awful it is to be considered “a dinosaur”, even if no one’s said it to you personally and it’s just something you’ve come to believe is being said in general. As someone who’s had every inch of her body critiqued on the internet and rape threats delivered to her home, I understand negative comments are dispiriting. When the misogynistic online movement known as “Gamergate” took off in August 2013 and many female writers, like myself, got their first online death threats, the commentator Brendan O’Neillgave us advicethat 12 years later I think everyone can appreciate was the right call: “The most remarkable thing about the frenzied national handwringing over Twitter trolls,” he wrote “is that anybody is taking it seriously. That people are buying into the harebrained idea that a handful of bedroom-bound blokes who tweet insults at women with one hand while doing God knows what with the other really do pose a threat to womankind, the entire internet, and the social fabric itself. It’s time we referred to this fretting over trolls by its real name: a moral panic.”Don’t give in to moral panic, fellas! Public abuse has zero broader ramifications!3. Embrace povertyIt’s true that as of 202265% of published authors in Australia are women. It’s also true that the median income from writing in this country is$18,200a year. Research indicates thatmen leave occupations that become predominantly female, perceiving a reduction in occupational prestige and the onset of declining wages: it’s known as “occupational feminisation”, and it’s also happened in clerical professions, teaching/academia and pharmacy.So don’t sweat about being invited to the right parties – given that most Australian writers work multiple jobs to subsidise their own writing,no one’s got the time to go to any!If you’re not interested in taking action to increase wages in the sector and thus bolster its prospects for gendered equalisation, don’t worry: the men who write 35% of the books still get45% of the reviews.It’s also true that women do dominate the jobs (84% of them) in the local publishing industry, receivingwagesbelow the national averageand conspicuously below comparable jobs inprofessional, scientific and technical occupations– if only there was some pattern we could draw. The good news for men is that representation of women – just like in theUSandBritain–mysteriously declinesas industry positions become more senior.4. Find an audienceComplex systemic factors shape opportunities in writing but, from fringe shack to content megacorp, one assessment determines them all: “Is there an audience for this?”. Once marginalised from the mainstream discourse, the dark, the female and the fresh built an audience for themselves – despite obstacles, despite prejudices – by speaking not merely of their communities but beyond them.That’s the job. And it’s the same jobRichard Flanagan,Tim Winton,Alan Wearne,John Kinsella,David Williamson,Rodney Halland every other Australian writer was doing when they launched new work last year.A lack of interest in this audience can’t be blamed on “silencing”. It’s an admission of the silence within.Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsPublishingOpinionGendercommentShareReuse this content"

But what if AI wrote it – and it’s not true?Archie BlandThe BBC said Apple Intelligence’s weirdly wrong output sullied its reputation. Apple eventually paused the tool – but its reaction was deeply worryingTue 4 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2025 11.44 ESTShareMy first mistake at the Guardian came, agonisingly enough, in my first article as a member of staff, and remainsmemorialised on the internetto this day. My subject was not a theoretical physician, a note at the end politely explained, but a theoretical physicist. Ten years later, it still makes me shudder.Still, I felt a little better about it when I saw the run that Apple’s artificial intelligence system went on recently. In its automated summaries of news notifications sent out to some iPhones, it asserted that Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing the UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, had shot himself. It said that Benjamin Netanyahu had been arrested. It said that Pete Hegseth, not then confirmed as Donald Trump’s secretary of defense, had resigned. And it said thatRafael Nadal was gay. For the avoidance of doubt: he didn’t, he wasn’t, he hadn’t and he isn’t.This litany of howlers were the product of the Apple Intelligence AI system, which was rolled out across the company’s recent phones in the UK in December. There was no way for publishers to opt out, and an inscrutable little arrow next to the source news organisation’s logo was the only marker that this was Apple Intelligence’s output, rather than their own. After the BBC ran a series of richly indignant news stories about the phenomenon, Apple did something it almost never does: it reversed course, andpaused the service. (Full disclosure: my wife works for Apple.)You could see why Apple pulled the plug: the story was funny and weird enough to get traction. Saying, as another of the summaries did, that Luke Littler had won the darts world championship final before he’d actually played in it, isthe six-fingered handof news events: something that almost looks real, but reveals itself as fatally and hilariously flawed if you pay close enough attention. If it had been up and running last summer, you dread to think what the summarising process might have done to the news of the assassination attempt against Donald Trump.How DeepSeek stunned the AI industry – podcastRead moreStill, the central dynamic here is of two implacably opposed cultures: one that embraces public iteration, and the many missteps that users will endure along the way; and one which knows that if it keeps getting things wrong, the whole point of its existence will be annulled. There’s no realistic way to reconcile these tendencies, but you might think a journalistic carve-out would be a grownup solution.We can’t expectAppleIntelligence to shudder when it reflects on these errors, because it doesn’t actually comprehend what a fact is – it just knows what one sounds like. What’s perhaps more alarming is the view from the other end of the telescope: that we might very easily not have known about these mistakes, and that there were almost certainly many others that went entirely unnoticed.All of this came to light only because journalists – at the BBC, but alsoProPublicaand the Washington Post – happened to receive the alerts in question. The summaries were locally generated on users’ phones, and Apple has no way to track them. That means that it is very likely that other users will have received inaccurate alerts, and blamed them on journalistic incompetence rather than a bot gone wild – or quite reasonably believed them to be true. There are probably still iPhone users roaming the streets under the impression that Father Christmas gave the king’s speech, or whatever.The BBC wasn’t the only news organisation to notice the problem, but it was the only one to really go after it publicly.The vigour of its coveragewas partly a submerged message to readers. “It didn’t hurt that it let people know that if they were seeing this, it wasn’t the BBC doing it,” one journalist there says. “But it was also about drawing a line in the sand with Apple and saying – look, this looks like it comes from us, and our reputation is completely founded on being reliable.”Some might scoff at this, and point out that news organisations make their own mistakes all the time – more consequential than my physicist/physician howler, if less humiliating. But cases of bad journalism are almost always warped representations of the real world, rather than missives from an imaginary one. Crucially, if an outlet gets big things wrong a lot, its reputation will suffer, and its audience are likely to vote with their feet, or other people will publish stories that air the mistake. And all of it will be out in the open.You may also note that journalists are increasingly likely to use AI in the production of stories – and there is no doubt that it is a phenomenally powerful tool, allowing investigative reporters tofind patterns in vast financial datasetsthat reveal corruption, or analyse satellite imagery forevidence of bombing attacksin areas designated safe for civilians. There is a legitimate debate over the extent of disclosure required in such cases: on the one hand, if the inputs and outputs are being properly vetted, it might be a bit like flagging the use of Excel; on the other, AI is still new enough that readers may expect you to err on the side of caution. Still, the fundamental difference is not in what you’re telling your audience, but what degree of supervision you’re exercising over the machine.In the end, the most telling part of all this may be Apple’s reaction. Even if it stonewalled for a month after the BBC’s first story, it is striking that a company with a longstanding reputation for defensiveness ultimately relented. But it will undoubtedly bring the product back, and it has not said where the bar is for accuracy that it will consider sufficient.Apple suspends AI-generated news alert service after BBC complaintRead moreThe really interesting question is why Apple made its use of AI in these summaries so invisible – if only there were two letters representing the technology that might easily be assembled into a legible icon! It’s a small detail, in one sense. But it also points to a much larger problem: when you’re dealing with the introduction of a revolutionary new technology that your users don’t really understand, adhering to your defining mission for simplicity may make things pretty complicated.The truth is, even if Apple is less thoroughly defined as an AI business than some of its big tech rivals, it is nevertheless a participant in a gold rush. The AI products that stick with us over the next few years may be a bit like the Qwerty keyboard against various alternatives, or Internet Explorer’s victory over Netscape: worse, but ultimately victorious because of their unconquerable scale. If so, a frictionless experience might be a very effective strategy.If the complaints of even the most venerable news outlets are part of the price, it won’t even touch the sides. In its latest software update last week, the same one that disabled the news summaries,Apple turned on AI by defaultfor the first time.Archie Bland is the editor of the Guardian’sFirst EditionnewsletterExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionAppleBBCDigital mediacommentShareReuse this content"

There is an answer, but it involves improving human behaviourTue 4 Feb 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2025 06.54 ESTShareCall it a tale of two puppies. You can tell a lot about 2020s Britain by looking at its two defining “designer” dogs: the cavapoo (or spoodle, or any of the other poodle-crosses), and the American XL bully.Both took off in popularity with a surge in dog ownershipduring the pandemic, promptingunscrupulous breedersto cash in on the demand; and both have been widely bred to prioritise appearance over good character or health. And, in their cartoonish contrast, both might be seen as emblematic of where our relationship with dogs has in recent decades gone awry. One is treated to puppuccinos and trips to the pub, while the other has been demonised as a killing machine.Saturday marked 12 months since it becamea criminal offenceto own an XL bully (without a certificate of exemption) in England and Wales. Legislation waspassed in December 2023, after a disturbing spate of serious attacks and fatalities. Now it is illegal to buy, sell, rehome, abandon or breed dogs of that type, while exempted dogs must be muzzled and leashed when outside the home.Hundreds of XL bullieshave been put down since the ban, and more than 55,000were grantedexemption certificates, reflecting the effort made to accommodate responsible owners. The question now is whether the public is more safe as a result. Of the nine fatal dog attacksreported in England and Walessince the ban was introduced, five involved XL bullies – but all occurred in private homes.If the ban protects even one person from harm, it has arguably been worth it. Twelve months in, however, there is not yet enough data to know, while the ban has clearlycaused confusionand createdextra work for police, vets and animal welfare organisations. Meanwhile, dogs attacks (by any type or breed) havecontinued to rise. This is not necessarily a surprise: bites resulting in hospitalisations have been rising steadilysince 1998, despite the Dangerous Dogs Act.Ban on XL bully dogs a ‘huge burden on policing’, force chiefs warnRead moreIt demonstrates the law’s serious limitations in tackling the overall public health threat posed by dogs. Animal welfare organisations, veterinary bodies and experts have long opposed breed-specific legislation on the grounds thatbreed is not a robust predictorof aggression.This focus on type(often boiling down, in practice, to how a dog looks) is not only misleading and unfair; it distracts from other measures that might effectively reduce bites and promote dog-human harmony overall, such asgenetic testingto identify animals with an inherited risk of aggression.In 2023, the government establisheda responsible dog ownership working group to explore how the UK might switch to a preventive approach, focusing on “deed, not breed” – but a source from that group told me that that preventative work lost all momentum with the debate over XL bullies, and has not recommenced with the new government. By seeming to act conclusively against the issue of “dangerous dogs”, the XL bully ban has cut short a much-needed discussion about dog control and ownership. Under the current approach, we don’t even understand the scale of dog bites and which breeds are actually responsible, let alone their triggers or causal factors.Groups on both sides are continuing to call for more detailed, centralised data-keeping on dog attacks to allow for analysis and evidence-based prevention. In the meantime, the XL bully ban may put owners, their family members and visitors to their homes at greater risk.David Martin, the head of animal welfare at the corporate veterinary group IVC Evidensia, says vets are concerned that exempted dogs – required to be leashed in public – are not receiving sufficient exercise, potentially leading to behavioural issues. Muzzles also exacerbate heat stress, another risk factor for aggression. If there’s a heatwave this summer, “we may run into issues”, Martin says. Meanwhile, the demand for large, intimidating “status dogs” has reportedly shifted to the cane corso and anatolian and caucasian shepherd dogs, just as the XL bully superseded the pit bull. In five years, will we be banning those, too?View image in fullscreenA cavapoo outside a polling station on election day in Eton Wick, Berkshire, 4 July 2024.Photograph: Maureen McLean/Rex/ShutterstockWe can continue playing whack-a-mole with different dog breeds, only after serious attacks – or we can take a step back, and reckon with where this relationship is going wrong. In recent decades, andparticularly since the pandemic, dogs have shifted from companions to commodities. The result is a dwindling acknowledgment of what all dogs need to live harmoniously alongside humans – sufficient daily exercise, socialisation, consistency, routine, respect – and haphazard commitment to providing it.A recentRSPCA report makesa host of recommendations to improve dog control and promote “a culture of care and compliance”, including ownership licensing, accreditation for trainers and public education campaigns on how to recognise signs of aggression. Above all, it describes the need for “attitudinal, behavioural and cultural change”, whereby all dog owners – not just those of controversial breeds – “understand how to appropriately and effectively acquire, care for and control” their pets.Certainly, that will be different for a cavapoo and an XL bully – but the consistent baseline should be respect for them as animals, and for their animal instincts. If we are serious about preventing attacks and fatalities, we can’t just keep sorting “good” breeds from “bad” as though we have no part in their actions or behaviour. Though we may treat them as status symbols, substitute children, soft toys or testosterone-boosters, dogs will be dogs. If you want to improve control, start by looking at ownership.Elle Hunt is a freelance journalistExplore more on these topicsDangerous dogsOpinionAnimalsDogsPetscommentShareReuse this content"

It is time to reassert European powerTue 4 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2025 08.11 ESTShareSqueezed betweenUS oligarchyand Russian and Chinese autocracy, Europe’s democracies stand out like a relic from a bygone age. The euphoria and sheepish groupthink on display at Donald Trump’s inauguration last month may well herald either a newUS “golden age”or a hubristic bubble bound to burst. It is possible that China will succeed in reshaping the world in its image, or it may succumb todemographic declineandeconomic stagnation. Europe is not alone in being at a historic crossroads, but it is exclusively mired inpessimism, despondency and self-doubt.In 1492, as Christopher Columbus landed in the Americas and Spain embarked on its ownsiglo de oro, or golden age, Spanish troops were readying to take over large parts of Italy. Europe’s highest concentration of wealth was to be found in cities such as Florence, Milan and Venice. Cities of beauty and civility, industry and trade; cities, above all, so mesmerised by their particular identities that they refused to form a unitary state. The eventual result was the partition of the Italian peninsula. There was no space for rival city states in a world of nations.Clear parallels exist with Europe’s fragmentation today. It is faced with a world in which so-called “civilisation states”, organised around cultural tradition rather than politics, have taken over from nation states.And simply hoping that Russian military expansionism, Chineseindustrial dumping, or US tariff threats will galvanise a resurgence of ambition within middle-size European countries won’t cut it. Fear, on its own, is a paralysing factor.EU leaders talk the talk about “robust responses” to being targeted by Trump’s latest tariff-war threat. But in reality, they have scarcely moved beyond self-flagellation, self-victimisation and awe of US and Chinese power. We need instead to recuperate audacity and hunger for the future, and relinquish some of our polite manners in a world that truly isn’t polite.Sure, we need to stay true to the moral preachings of the German philosopher Immanuel Kant and keep on believing that a rules-based world of equals will come one day. But in the meantime, and to keep that prospect alive, we need to recognise, celebrate and fight to defend our joint achievements.As the US governmentreadies to colonise Mars, itgives upall responsibility for ensuring the continued habitability of our warming planet. As Trump inflateshis own meme coin, he boycotts global agreements onminimum corporate taxation. And as AI investment rockets, the US’s streets of desperation are scarred byendemic drug addictionand poverty.In all three accounts, Europe is ahead. The EU is aworld leaderin renewable energy, industrial efficiency and climate policy. It has crafted a unique social market economy thatlimits the excessesof unbridled capitalism. High levels of internal solidarity may not provide everyone with a home to live in, but they at least provide everyone with a safety net beneath which they won’t fall.True, difficulties also abound. Economic productivity isin decline, as Europe falls well behind China and the US in the technological race. Europe is unable to defend itself militarily. It is energy dependent. And yet, as for the Italian city states of old, all these apparently insurmountable problems would be solved with one step: greater unity.Were the EU to leverage its gigantic butfragmented capital markets, it would have the resources to invest in its economic and technological relaunch – and to limit the impact of foreign-owned social media such as TikTokon democracy. If European governments coordinated their defence spending, they would have little to fear: EU member states spent€326bn (£270bn)in 2024 compared with Russia’s€145bn (£121bn)for 2025. If they spoke with one voice, the EU would have the capacity, as recent agreements with South America’sMercosurbloc andMexicoshow, to weave together deals that would make not only Europe but the world a better place.Acting together, Europe’s democracies would, for instance, be able to discusscoordinated climate action with China, and not merely run scared at the sight of a Chinese EV. We know that lack of access to capital is an extraordinary bottleneck preventing developing countries from engaging in the green transition. Couldn’t a joint Sino-European financing plan help dot Vietnam and Indonesia, Kenya and Peru, with European wind turbines and Chinese battery systems – simultaneously greening the planet and utilising European and Chinese excess industrial capacity?Europe would also be able to safeguard, in the US’s absence, a longer-term investment in democracy, the rule of law and multilateralism. That would counter the dismissal of an insistence on democratic values as mere hypocritical western self-interest. Paradoxical as it may sound, making Europe a power in the world is the surest way of building a world that moves beyond great power competition.Such aspirations are not a matter of left or right, liberalism or populism. Nor are they a question of relinquishing national identity to a centralised Brussels bureaucracy. They are, rather, a matter of wanting to be a subject, not merely an object, of history.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nationalism, Meloni’s own tradition, should be exactly the opposite of servitude.Ultimately, a type of European civic or democratic nationalism is what needs to be fostered if Europeans are to avoid turning into waiters for the world’s powerful as they descend on our cities to admire our beautiful past. We need to see something that visionary leaders on the European continent have often aspired to but never achieved: pluralist societies cohering in a common European “nation”.A European nation need not be a superstate. Rather, it would be based on the idea that always eluded the Italian city states: uniting on what truly mattered for the preservation of their way of life. But whether we decide this should be in energy security, technology or foreign policy, and regardless of whether we see it happening through a deepening of the EU or through something new, nothing will change until we foster a common sense of European patriotism. If the recent experience of the EU has taught us one thing, it is that a common people does not emerge out of a common currency. We created a European currency. Now we need to create a European people.This may all sound unrealistic. But is it any more so than the aspiration to colonise Mars? Building a new nation called Europe could be our Martian adventure and our best bet at fighting despondency and self-doubt, fear and pessimism, oligarchy and autocracy.Lorenzo Marsili is a philosopher, activist, author and director of the Berggruen Institute EuropeExplore more on these topicsEuropeOpinionDonald TrumpGiorgia MeloniChinacommentShareReuse this content"

I’m glad it was madeGareth BenestThe backlash to the reality series misses a key point: if this was an educational documentary, would anyone watch it?Gareth Benest is advocacy director for the charity International Broadcasting TrustTue 4 Feb 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2025 09.39 ESTShareChannel 4’s new reality seriesGo Back to Where You Came Frommay not please either side of the debate around refugees and irregular migration, but I’m very glad it was made. From its title onwards, the series doesn’t treat its subject matter with the sensitivity that many would hope for. The first episode opens with a participant saying, as he looks out over the white cliffs of Dover: “What I’d do is, I’d set landmines up, and then any boat that comes within 50m of this beach, they’d get blown up.”Add to that the spectacle of Brits trundling through a war-torn city in armoured cars repeatedly describing it as a “shithole”, and you have enough toxic bigotry to send my blood pressure soaring. But the point of the programme isn’t to platform extreme views: it’s to force those spouting them to face the reality of irregular migration and to challenge their preconceptions.When the trailer was released earlier this month, it ignited a predictablyfurious responseonline, andstinging criticismfrom leading human rights and refugee charities. But what this fails to take into account is the relative lack of in-depth coverage of migration and the urgent need to foster greater understanding, even if that means resorting to unorthodox methods.In four parts, the series follows six participants with very strong opinions on the plights and rights of refugees. Small groups, each including two people with virulently anti-refugee opinions and one much more sympathetic, are taken to Mogadishu in Somalia and Raqqa in Syria to witness the devastation of war and what faces those who remain. The participants gradually make their way back to the UK, learning about the dangers refugees face along the way, including a simulation of a “small boat” crossing.Several highly respected charities condemned the programme’s “sensational” approach, which one described as “A Place in the Sun meets Benefits Street”. The seriousness of the subject, they said, requires a more educational treatment and they urged broadcasters to invest in documentaries instead. Another raised fears that it would perpetuate racist tropes and could fuel the kind of disinformation and dehumanisation that sparked riots in 2024.For years I’ve asked ministers what they expect refugees to do. They never have an answer | Diane TaylorRead moreThe charities up in arms would prefer to hear the voices of people with direct experience. So would I. I have spent more than 20 years delivering community video projects around the world, working with underrepresented communities to amplify their voices on key issues. I work as an advocacy director for acharity dedicatedto ensuring the media tells more and better stories about our world, its people, cultures, communities and concerns.I want broadcasters to produce more serious programmes about many issues; and honestly I would prefer it if reality TV was not the answer toanyquestion. But we need to be honest about the challenges facing public service broadcasters such asChannel 4as they continue trying (with dwindling incomes) to inform, educate and entertain audiences that have countless alternatives to watch.Documentaries don’t regularly find large audiences, particularly not among people unsympathetic to the subject matter. The smaller the audience, the less likely it is to achieve a positive impact. I wonder how many people watched the outstanding BBCdocumentary Dark Waters: Africa’s Deadliest Migration Route about those risking their lives to escape extreme poverty and conflict in west Africa. It was presented by Mame Cheikh Mbaye, a Senegalese reporter who had spent a decade supporting migrants landing in the Canary Islands. Not many people will have heard about it, given that BBC One only broadcast a truncated version at 2.30am.The reality is that contentious issues need alternative formats to find a mass audience. In 2023, the country obsessed over whether Rwanda was a safe country to send asylum seekers to. Yet I couldn’t find a single programme (outside news bulletins) about Rwanda – its people, society, government – and I carefully monitor the public service broadcasters’ international coverage. It was not until a month before the “stop the boats” general election, on 5 June 2024, that the BBC smuggled the subject into a celebrity-fronted travelogue, The Misadventures of Romesh Ranganathan on BBC Two. The programme did manage to touch on Rwanda’s recent human rights record and internal suppression, but it speaks volumes that it falls to a comedian to tell us about the place where our asylum seekers were to be sent.Likewise, ITV could have commissioned a documentary about the Post Office Horizon IT scandal, but it’s unlikely to have been aseffective as the dramaMr Bates vs the Post Office. It’s worth noting that despite its success, ITVmade a lossof about £1m on the production.View image in fullscreenScarlett Moffatt and her family with the Himba tribe in northern Namibia for the Channel 4 programme The British Tribe Next Door.Photograph: David Bloomer/Channel 4/PAYes, Channel 4 has a long history of controversial reality shows that purport to shed light on topical issues but fail badly.Benefits Street became a byword for crass and exploitative television, whileThe British Tribe Next Door(in which a Gogglebox participant lived alongside an Indigenous community in Namibia, in a replica of her suburban home) remains hard to forget, and harder still to fathom how anyone thought it could contribute anything. But these (and other) failures from the past should not dissuade Channel 4 from being brave and trying new approaches. That is what it is meant to do, after all.Go Back to Where You Came From is based on an Australian series that became the broadcaster SBS’s highest rated programme in 2011. It drew large audiences, blew up on social media, and prompted a live televised discussion on the issues.No, the participants cannot possibly experience the real dangers and privations of irregular migration and, yes, it’s uncomfortably voyeuristic at times. But then the participants listen, open mouthed, as refugees tell them their stories, or a participant says “This is the shit you don’t see on telly”, and I remember why it is important. I believe Channel 4 is making a genuine attempt to shed light on the experiences of refugees and it has given it a primetime slot: 9pm on Monday evenings. I’m grateful to them for trying.Gareth Benest is advocacy director for the charity International Broadcasting TrustDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As this week’s Guardian Essential Report shows, Dutton has a bit to work with.Table showing responses to the question: How much power do you think each of the following groups have compared to other groups?When we ask people to say which groups have more power and less power compared to other groups, they are more likely to see groups they identify with as being in deficit, while others are perceived to do better.While some of these findings are marginal, others are quite stark – especially around sexual and gender identity and disability. Older Australians are also much more likely to see themselves lacking power compared to other groups.This was the logic behind the campaign against the voice to parliament; a majority of Australians were convinced that having a right to be heard written into the constitutionrepresented special treatment for First Nations people.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe evil genius underpinning the attacks on DEI is that they allow leaders like Trump and Dutton to punch down without leaving any obvious bruising.Rather than attacking any minority group directly, they focus their ire on programs designed by so-called “elites” within government and corporations to address the systemic power imbalances that underpin social and economic inequality.Dutton’s confrontational approach also plays into the broader leadership narrative the Coalition is pursuing; that Dutton is a strong leader with firm beliefs while Albanese is a weak leader who swings in the breeze. Again, a separatequestion on leadership attributesshows again why Dutton is working this angle so assiduously.Table showing responses to the question: Which of the following describe your opinion of the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and opposition leader, Peter Dutton?While both leaders share the negatives of most politicians, Albanese is labouring under the weight of incumbency, where compromise – part of the PM’s job description – is parsed as a lack of conviction.The indicators most concerning to the PM in this table would be that he is seen as more out of touch with ordinary people and less decisive than Dutton. For his part, Dutton’s perception of aggression illustrates the sunk cost in running such confrontational politics.These cleavages are exemplified by the ongoing antisemitism issue and the crisis in Gaza. While Albanese attempts to turn the temperature down in the name of social cohesion, Dutton pours fuel on the fire in pursuit of political definition.But riding the DEI beast is not without its dangers. As Trump’s wild return to office dominates news feeds, Dutton will be invited by his boosters to embrace the US president’s excesses at a time when most Australians would rather have grown-up leadership.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While the systems that give “special treatment” to minorities are seen as unfair, so too is the status quo. While we agree we should address historical injustice, we are not convinced the current programs are effective.This shows how the weaponisation of difference on both sides of the debate clouds our shared aspiration of the fair go, as power becomes a zero-sum game where for every winner someone must lose.Rather than being a motif for individual identity maybe we need to think about the value of organisations that reflect the real world, about the way we define merit and the way we learn from others with different life experience. This is when the diversity challenge becomes an opportunity.Dutton would know from his time as a cop that confessions elicited under duress are inherently suspect. So too is any pretence to social consensus that is generated by fear and loathing in this era of algorithmic anger amplification.Albanese’s Australia Day response, wherehe quipped Peter Dutton was having “a fight with an imaginary friend”is a good start in diffusing his DEI menace.Even better was Sam Kekovich’sannual intervention in the national zeitgeist.

Dutton is a master divider when it comes to First Nations peoples and migrants, and hisremarks at the Menzies Foundationdid not depart from his typical fare. In addition to his comments about DEI, Dutton took aim at new migrants, suggesting that Labor has created a housing crisis since it “opened the migration floodgates”, and said the voice referendum was “a standout example of Labor’s indulgent spending”.As we head into an election season we are likely to hear more of these sorts of attacks from the opposition leader and his colleagues.Peter Dutton’s push to axe DEI public service positions ‘straight from the Donald Trump playbook’Read moreIf it wasn’t an election year, I would be inclined to ignore the comments. However, Dutton is a shrewd politician and havingwatched how Trump has parlayed venom into votes, I am sure he is betting that this type of rhetoric will resonate with voters. On the back of the voice outcome and the vitriolit helped to unleash, I’m concerned that he might be right.The opposition leader may be gambling that “commonsense” voters don’t need to see themselves as rightwingers to intuitively agree that there is too much talk about affirmative action, DEI and talk of racism and colonialism.To be honest, I’m not a huge fan of the DEI industrial complex, which too often focuses on“one-time, ‘inspirational’ events to ‘raise awareness’ of inequity”and neglects the more important work of rooting out institutional racism and sexism.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailOf course this is not Dutton’s critique of DEI. Conservative opposition to diversity programs is typically based on the idea that taking into account the gender, sexual identity and race of job applicants reinforces inequalities and divisions by punishing white men for problems they did not create.As the data on Australian workplaces shows, many applicants from migrant backgrounds struggle to even get a job interview. In a two-year study conducted by Kings College and Monash University,researchers found thatapplicants from ethnic minorities were almost half as likely to receive a call back than applicants with English names when they applied for a non-leadership position. The figures got worse as applicants sought more senior roles. Ethnic minorities applying for leadership positionsreceived 57.4% fewer call backsthan applicants with English names.In addition to this, while we often talk about the under-representation of minorities in senior roles, in Australia, white people are overrepresented in senior leadership roles. Roughly a quarter of Australia’s population is not white, but 95% of senior leaders are white.It’s pretty obvious that this is an unfair situation. DEI programs seek to level the playing field so that First Nations people and people from migrant communities who have worked incredibly hard but didn’t go to “the right schools” have a fair shot at getting hired because of what they know, rather than who they know, or what they look like. Many DEI programs do this important work – especially when they are led by people with lived experience of minoritisation.The best DEI programs consider a whole range of systemic barriers to access – race and gender of course, but notably class and physical access as well.It’s a pity I have to go over this well-trod ground. Because ultimately the fight Dutton and others like him want to have about diversity is a distraction.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe cost of arguing over DEI with every Peter, Sussan and Jacinta is very high. We must remember that it is far easier for Dutton to distract the public with a whipped-up debate on DEI, than it is for him to speak to how his party will address the racism that allows non-Indigenous people to live almost a decade longer than First Nations people.Dutton and his colleagues in the Coalition say they are worried about Australians who are doing it tough. If this is truly the case, they will have campaign ideas about how to tackle the racism at the root of poor First Nations poverty indicators. Research carried out last year showed that people living in remote Indigenous communities are paying more thandouble the capital city prices for everyday groceries.The same is true for the housing crisis which has also made headlines in the last few years. Decades of research tells us that racism plays a role in housing insecurity for Aboriginal and migrant communities. The lack of affordable housing affects everyone, it is especially acute for those who are struggling not just to afford housing, but to access it due to systemic discrimination.In fact I’m far more interested in how politicians of all stripes will address these fundamental issues than I am in being distracted by spurious debates about DEI. The job of voters is to have conversations on our own terms, rather than allow issues to be framed on our behalf.With Trump in the White house, Australians will have to focus on what matters most, which is electing a government that will lead with integrity and fairness, rather than division.Sisonke Msimang is the author of Always Another Country: A Memoir of Exile and Home (2017) and The Resurrection of Winnie Mandela (2018)Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsOpinionPeter DuttonCoalitioncommentShareReuse this content"

More than 300 million customers worldwide were affected.Event ticketing companyTicketmasterwas also hacked last year. The details of several hundred million customers, including names, addresses, credit card numbers, phone numbers and payment details were illegally accessed.So-called“card-not-present fraud”, where an offender processes an unauthorised transaction without having the card in their physical possession, accounts for92% of all card fraudin Australia. Thisrose 29%in the last financial year.Thecard verification value(CVV, or three-digit number on the back of a credit card) aimed to ensure the person making the transaction had the physical card in their hands. But it is clearly ineffective.Benefits of removing credit card numbersRemoving the credit card number is the latest attempt to curb fraud. Removing numbers stops fraudsters processing unauthorised card-not-present transactions.Nuclear curious? Here’s what you need to know about the Coalition’s energy claimsRead moreIt also reduces the potential for financial damage of victims exposed in data breaches, if organisations are no longer able to store these payment details.The storage of personal information is a contested issue. For example, the2022 Optusdata breach exposed information from customers who had previously held accounts with the telco back in 2018.Removing the ability of organisations to store payment details in the first place removes the risk of this information being exposed in any future attack.While any efforts to reduce fraud are welcome, this new approach raises some new issues to consider.Potential problems with the new systemMastercardhas saidcustomers will use tokens generated by the customer’s banking app or biometric authentication instead of card numbers.This is likely to be an easy transition for customers who use mobile banking.However, the use of digital banking is not universal. Manysenior consumersand those with adisabilitydon’t use digital banking services. They would be excluded from the new protections.While strengthening the security attached to credit cards, removing numbers shifts the vulnerability to mobile phones and telecommunication providers.Offenders already access victims’ phones throughmobile portingandimpersonation scams. These attacks are likely to escalate as new ways to exploit potential vulnerabilities are found.There are also concerns about biometrics. Unlike credit card details, which can be replaced when exposed in a data breach, biometrics are fixed. Shifting a focus to biometrics will increase the attractiveness of this data, and potentially opens victims up to ongoing, irreversible damage.While not as common, breaches of biometric data do occur.For example, web-based security platformBioStar 2in the UK exposed the fingerprints and facial recognition details of more than 1 million people. Closer to home, IT provider to entertainment companiesOutaboxis alleged to have exposed facial recognition data of more than one million Australians.Will we really need cards in the future?While removing the numbers may reduce credit card fraud, emerging smart retail technologies may remove the need for cards all together.Guardian Essential poll: more voters say Albanese ‘out of touch’ with ordinary Australians than Peter DuttonRead moreSmartphone payments are already becoming the norm, removing the need for physical cards.GlobalDatarevealed a 58% growth in mobile wallet payments in Australia in 2023 to $146.9bn. In October 2024, 44% of payments were“device-present”transactions.Amazon’s innovative“Just-Walk-Out”technology has also removed the need for consumers to bring a physical credit or debit card altogether.This technology is available at more than 70 Amazon-owned stores and at more than 85 third-party locations across the US, UK and Australia. These includesports stadiums, airports, grocery stores,convenience storesand college campuses.Thetechnologyuses cameras, weight sensors and a combination of advanced AI technologies to enable shoppers in physical stores make purchases without having to swipe or tap their cards at the checkout line.Such technology is now being offered by a variety of other vendors includingTrigo,CognizantandGrabango. It is also being trialled across other international retailers, including supermarket chains Tesco and ALDI.While Just-Walk-Out removes the need to carry a physical card, at some point consumers still need to enter their cards details into an app. So, to avoid cards and numbers completely, smart retail tech providers are moving to biometric alternatives, likefacial recognition payments.Considering the speed at which smart retail and payment technology is entering the marketplace, it is likely physical credit cards, numberless or not, will soon become redundant, replaced by biometric payment options.This articleoriginally appeared in the Conversation.

In scenes that verge on slapstick, Jack tries on various identities, attempts to lose his virginity and eventually tells his family he is gay. Yet Jack is also grieving for his father and Big Boys has moments so wrenching that you may find yourself, as I did, suddenly in pieces.Since 2022, Pointing has been putting the lad into the hit Channel 4 comedy. In a role that has made its way to front and centre, he plays Danny, Jack’s flatmate and best mate, inverting the trope of the gay best friend. At 25, Danny is a mature student: a straight blokey bloke who supports Jack in his coming out and introduces him to life as a fresher, all while struggling with his own mental health problems. When Danny comes off antidepressants in the hope his sexual performance will improve, things don’t go to plan. “Sometimes,” says Pointing, “I’d be like, ‘Does Danny have to be so horny?’” He thought the key to playing the character was to make him “too happy – trying a bit too hard to have a good time”.Explaining why the finale destroyed me would constitute a spoiler, but I can say that Danny is at the heart of it all. When I tell Pointing I had to switch it off early, because I didn’t want to talk to him with tears streaming down my face, he says people often tell him Big Boys has made them cry. “Which is strange for a comedy,” he says. But then it’s that kind of comedy: one minute you’re laughing hysterically about a performance poetry circle gone wrong; the next you’re sobbing over a resurgent wave of grief.Pointing is speaking from a bedroom filled with clothes and cats. None are his, it turns out. “I’m on baby duty today,” he says. “So I’ve had to dive into a mate’s house while they look after her downstairs.” His daughter – his first child – is five-and-a-half months old. “She’s very funny, she’s very social, she’s great.”His wife, Sarah, runs a theatre company calledFigs in Wigs. “It’s notmainstreamtheatre,” he says with a smile. “It’s slightly stranger and more surreal.” Sarah was heavily pregnant when Pointing was filming this third and last Big Boys series. “On the one hand, knowing it was the last series, I was like, ‘Savour this.’ I could feel myself wanting to remember everything. But on the other hand, my brain was being pulled away, because I was thinking, ‘The baby could happen any second.’” In the end, she arrived five days after filming finished. “Production were very grateful to Sarah for not giving birth during the shoot.”A TV producer told me I needed to find my inner Alice from The Vicar of DibleyPointing’s journey towards on-screen lad was a surprising one, especially to him. He was born in London and once said he grew up on “a slightly nicer housing estate, but still an estate” in Epsom. The LGBTQ+ community, he says, has always been a big part of his life. “My oldest childhood friend is gay, came out when we were teenagers, and my mum had gay friends. So I’m a bit more open to it. But when I met my wife, that was her gang, her tribe.”He found himself at cabaret nights, club nights and gay venues, with people fromSink the PinkandDuckie.Jack Rooke, writer and creator of Big Boys, has said Pointing knows more about queer culture than him. It all fed into his character: when Pointing started to spend time in queer spaces, he “suddenly felt the most heterosexual I’d ever felt in my life. So straight!” Before then, he’d never seen himself as particularly laddish. “I studied drama!” he jokes in a faux-theatrical voice. “I’m trying to be an actor!”As well as acting, Pointing has done standup for years. During lockdown, he put out an acclaimed comedy series on YouTube calledKey Worker, in which he played Bradley from Bromley, a joyfully enthusiastic young man (“Someone who’s comfortable not knowing things”) who volunteers at a food bank. Steve Coogan called it “warm, funny and beautifully observed”.View image in fullscreenInverting the trope of the gay best friend … with Dylan Llewellyn in the new series of Big Boys.Photograph: Patch Dolan/Channel 4When Pointing started doing live comedy, he couldn’t help comparing it with the cabaret scene. “I’m speaking generally, because I was a bit on the outskirts of both, but the comedy world isn’t as supportive. In a gay club or a queer place, the fact that someone’s got up on stage is enough – you should support them because it is a huge deal for them.Comedyis a bit more like, ‘Right, if you’re even a little bit shit, you’re getting it.’” He preferred the people he met in queer spaces. “So that became my friendship group as well, because I found it a really lovely place to be.”One of his first TV jobs was 2017’sPls Like, an early satire on influencer culture. “I played a sort of vapid, cheery, cheeky chappy – but I didn’t think that’s what I was.” How did he see himself then? “I did want to do comedy, but I saw myself as a bit morose, a bit serious.” He soon realised “there’s this distance between how you see yourself and how the rest of the world sees you”. He does an impression of “every casting I ever had”, turning Cheeky Chappy up to full volume:“Is there gonna be girls there? I’m not gonna go if there’s gonna be no girls.”He laughs. “That was basically it.”Why does he think he gives that impression? “Maybe it’s partly my looks, a little bit my accent? Most of the people going up for those roles were middle class, maybe a bit more than that. So maybe there weren’t as many people like me doing it. Once you know that, you lean into it.” In his early comedy days, he used to do “a preening acting coach. He was based on my lecturers at uni and a couple of my mum’s ex-boyfriends. Made out he was a sensitive guy but actually he was a creep.”One night, a producer came up to him after a show. “He said, ‘It’s great, but I think you need to find your Alice from The Vicar of Dibley.’” Alice was the sitcom’s ditsy clown. “Basically, that’s how he saw me: you need to find your silly, goofy ... And that kind of is what happened.”View image in fullscreen‘Right, you’re getting it!’ … Ponting performing standup at the Moth Club in London.Photograph: Claire Haigh/UKTVNow Pointing has become a regular face on TV. He’s done plenty of comedy (Plebs, Starstruck), comedy-drama (Smothered), period drama (Agatha Christie adaptation Murder Is Easy) and drama (Queenie, Sweetpea). His next project is a Harlan Coben blockbuster for Netflix. Although he is less often typecast, it does still happen. “I definitely get roles where they just want you to do what you’ve done, but without any of the depth. There’s no point me playing a version of Danny for half an episode of something. It seems to cheapen it, really, if I just turn up in everyone’s show as a lad.”And Danny is far more complicated than that. He’s as sensitive as Jack (who is played by Dylan Llewellyn) but lacks a strong family to support him. His father is a deadbeat and his cousin is in prison. In gay clubs, Pointing says, people often come up to him. “They give me a hug, they say ‘Thank you, I love this’, and quote something.” But in other places, he notices that men send their girlfriends over to talk to him instead. He sees the irony in the fact that some men struggle to talk about how much they love Danny, a man who struggles to talk. “That happens quite a lot. That’s when I’m like, ‘There is obviously still a long way to go.’ It’s so deeply entrenched, isn’t it?”He is including himself in that judgement. “I think I’m quite good at talking, and as you can see, you can’t shut me up sometimes. But I do struggle to articulate myself at times. Or I just don’t. Somewhere along the way, men – or boys – just sort of go off and don’t really talk about things. It’s weird.” He pauses. “I don’t know how we fix that.”‘Phoebe Waller-Bridge just asked me to write her a play’: Big Boys creator Jack Rooke on going stratosphericRead moreAt 38, Pointing is a decade older than his character, and as the show ends, his own life is changing dramatically, too. “Knowing I was about to have a baby,” he says, “and knowing my life was about to move into this next chapter, it felt quite pertinent.” He felt he was waving goodbye to his own youth – a youth that was “heavily extended thanks to Big Boys”.But after three series, he was ready to grow up. “Because, as I say, in real life I feel like I am graduating from these roles.” So we’re going to find out how the cheeky chappy evolves? “Yeah! What sort of bloke will that be? What sort of man? I guess we’ll find out.”Pointing has to go – he’s on baby duty, after all. Afterwards, I watch the rest of the finale. Pointing had promised me that Rooke had pulled off a “masterstroke”. All I can say is he’s not wrong.Big Boys is on Channel 4 on 9 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTV comedyComedyTelevisionSexualityinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The makers of Becoming Led Zeppelin relive the tactics – and cups of tea – that got it green litRobin DenselowTue 4 Feb 2025 10.12 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2025 17.17 ESTShareBernard MacMahon says he knew he was taking a massive risk. The Irish-British film-maker and his Scottish partner Allison McGourty had spent 10 months researching a film about that massively successful but elusive rock bandLed Zeppelin. They put together a storyboard, listened to every interview they could find, and started to dig out archive film to tell the story of the band’s early years in the late 60s.That was when Jimmy Page, a successful session guitarist, joined the Yardbirds, then wanted to create a band of his own. He signed up John Paul Jones, another virtuoso session star, and two little-known West Midlands musicians: the wildly inventive drummer John Bonham, and singerRobert Plant. Overlooked in Britain, Led Zeppelin found fame in America, where they were attacked in the music press but became celebrities through their live shows, without the help of the media.Jimmy Page arrived carrying a Waitrose bag. I thought he’d brought sandwiches with himThe film-makers’ research was funded, says MacMahon, on the understanding that “it was incredibly likely that once I put in a phone call, the group might say they were not interested. There was every chance we would not even get a meeting.” After all, Led Zeppelin had always refused most interviews or TV appearances – let alone an authorised film biography in which the three surviving members would appear.But Page did agree to a meeting, at a hotel in London in November 2017, to which he arrived carrying Waitrose shopping bags. “I wondered if he had brought sandwiches,” says MacMahon, who took out a leather-bound book with the storyboard – “pictures but no words” – and started talking through it. When he got to the part of the story where Page first meets Plant, the guitarist asked which band he was then in. “Hobbstweedle,” was the answer. “Very good,” said Page. “Carry on.”Later he queried a date with MacMahon, “and opened the shopping bags to show he had brought his old diaries, dating back to the 60s”. After seven hours “with a break for afternoon tea”, Page said: “I’m in – but you have to get the others on board.”A few days later he rang MacMahon and asked “would you like to go to Pangbourne with me?”, then accompanied the film-makers to see the boathouse where he once lived, where the band had rehearsed. “Later,” says McGourty, “he revealed it had been a test. ‘If you had said no to Pangbourne we wouldn’t have done the film.’”Next to be approached was bass and keyboard player John Paul Jones, who said he was “not interested in a documentary”. So MacMahon sent him a copy ofAmerican Epic, the duo’s documentary series about the impact of the first-ever recordings of blues, country, cajun and Mexican musicians back in the 1920s, which Robert Redford, who narrated it, called “America’s greatest untold story”. MacMahon asked Jones to “watch 15 minutes, and if you don’t want to talk to us after that, you won’t hear from us again and that will be the end of the film”. Jones rang back, they had a four-hour chat, and he too was in.View image in fullscreenThe band in London in 1968 … from left, John Paul Jones, Jimmy Page, Robert Plant and John Bonham.Photograph: Dick Barnatt/RedfernsSo that left Plant, who seemed the least likely to talk – partly because he was enjoyinga successful, varied careerand because Zeppelin had ended tragically, with the death of Bonham in 1980. But he was a fan of American Epic, as he told MacMahon and McGourty when they met him at a concert in Scotland. After two more meetings, he agreed to talk back in Birmingham.His interview is delightfully candid. He describes how he became a musician in defiance of his parents, who wanted him to be a chartered accountant, and how in his struggling early years he would siphon petrol from other peoples’ cars.Bonham also appears in the film – in voice if not vision. MacMahon had heard a “bad quality bootleg” of an interview he had given in Australia, but had no idea where it came from. But after lengthy research, and the perseverance of an archivist, it was found in a pile of uncatalogued radio tapes. Bonham plays a crucial role in the film “because he acts as a narrator. His interviews were recorded just after things had happened. Jimmy said in some ways he’s the star of the film because he’s in the moment.”To keep the three surviving band members in the moment as well, MacMahon says: “We had memorabilia in the room when we were doing the interviews, constantly showing them clips and photographs, old newspapers, ticket stubs … anything we could think of that would be entertaining. In the film we show Jimmy looking at footage of the Bath festival he hadn’t seen before. That’s why for me it’s like a feature film … they are walking you through the story, as they hit each new obstacle … they are reliving it”.MacMahon says that once the band had agreed to the film, they never interfered or demanded any editorial control. But he wanted to “make sure what they were saying was backed up by their contemporaries”, so after Jones had talked about buying an organ for a church and becoming a choir master at the age of 14, he tracked down the priest involved. And when Page talked about playing on Goldfinger, MacMahon tracked down Vic Flick, the James Bond theme guitarist.View image in fullscreenAt the Chateau Marmont hotel in LA, 1969.Photograph: ZUMA Press, Inc./AlamyThe interviews were conducted in 2018, after which the duo worked on sourcing the music that makes up much of the film – either from early Zeppelin themselves, or musicians who influenced them or that they had worked with. Searching out rare archive recordings they were introduced to Sam Rapallo, who runs the band’s website, and entered “the mysterious world of Led Zeppelin collecting. The band are very publicity shy, and fans often mirror the personality of a group.”McGourty travelled across America and Britain, finding high quality film of Dazed and Confused in an attic in the New Forest, and of I Can’t Quit You Baby in an Oxfordshire village. They searched out original negatives or tapes to get the best sound, and when taking sound from an album they used “the very best lacquers, to make you feel you were there”. Unlike in most music documentaries, many of the songs are played in full, “because they are meant to be heard that way”.The film ends with What Is and What Should Never Be, filmed at Zeppelin’s headlining show at the Royal Albert Hall, London, in 1970. It is a triumphant finale that leaves out what was to follow – the exploration of more acoustic styles, Page’s fascination with Aleister Crowley and the occult, the decade of massive financial success, the stories of sex, drugs and rock’n’roll excess … and even Stairway to Heaven. So why stop there?“Because I always felt this was a self-contained story,” says MacMahon. “In January 1970 they have become the most popular band in north America and now return to Britain. In that closing song the audience now accept them as returning heroes. All the band’s families are there and this is the coming together of their childhood story.”True to form, the three surviving members will not be appearing on TV or giving interviews to promote Becoming Led Zeppelin. But they have issued quotes. Page says “the energy of the story and power of the music is phenomenal”, while for Plant, “American Epic inspired me to contribute to … a remarkable journey into the heart of the whirlwind.”Becoming Led Zeppelin opens in Imax on 5 February, and in other cinemas on 7 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsLed ZeppelinDocumentaryMusic documentaryRobert PlantfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Totalitarianism’s propensity for being tedious as well as grotesque is captured rather too well by the director Joe Wright’s lavish, stagey Mussolini: Son of the Century, an eight-part dramatisation of Antonio Scurati’s prize-winning book. It’s quite a spectacle, but it doesn’t half go on.Luca Marinelli is magnificently disgusting asBenito Mussolini, who founds the Italian Fasces of Combat – a gang of thugs bent on beating up socialists and channelling the fury of neglected first world war veterans – in 1919. Six years later, which in this drama is the best part of six episodes, he has established himself as Italy’s fascist dictator, in a way that will give his European neighbours some pointers on the obstacles to power that must be overcome.In episode one, Mussolini lists most of those obstacles when he outlines what fascism stands against: the church, the monarchy, the Italian state as it was then and the concept of elections are all, he says, brakes on the strong government his country needs.But his biggest pain comes from socialists, who refuse to go away no matter how many times Mussolini’s goons cosh them in restaurants or set fire to their offices. Marinelli skilfully portrays a man who is in essence a ridiculous loser, dogged by self‑doubt and only ever one bad piece of oratory away from losing the faith of his followers, but who slowly grows in stature as, through sheer persistence and the fecklessness of his opponents, he endures.It is a long grind and here, unfortunately, it feels like one. If Mussolini is not giving a speech from the stage, he is doling one out one-to-one to an acolyte or adversary; if he can’t do that, he picks on us instead and orates directly to camera. Political schemers are well suited to breaking the fourth wall, and Mussolini here gives us some good sly asides, but Wright takes the idea of moving beyond regular drama an awful lot further.View image in fullscreenBristling with intrigue … Barbara Chichiarelli as Mussolini’s mistress, muse and mentor Margherita Sarfatti.Photograph: Andrea PirrelloThis Mussolini introduces himself via a long monologue, where he moves through the people around him talking only to us. The backstreets of Milan, with their urchins gathered on corners and their high wooden scaffolds, have the look of a stage set, and at the start of episode two we go full musical, with a sort of techno-rap dance interlude. There are a lot of political ideas and opinions to chew through; the obvious answer would be to omit some, but Wright glories in them instead, giving us not just a primer on the rise of Italian fascism, but also a comprehensive compendium of thingsJoe Wrightthinks look cool. Ballot slips spin in a cage as Mussolini spins a grenade on his desk; the mouths of his detractors appear through holes in a black screen; characters are filmed from above, from the side, in disorienting closeup or from bewilderingly far away.This is a shame, because when Son of the Century plays it straight, it does so very well. Marinelli is the sort of actor other performers long to share a two-hander with and, although they tend to be too lengthy, most of the unadorned dialogue scenes bristle with intrigue. Mussolini sparring with his right-hand man, Cesare Rossi (Francesco Russo), is a delight; we are never totally sure who is controlling whom. There is a similar dynamic with Mussolini’s mistress, muse and mentor, Margherita Sarfatti (Barbara Chichiarelli), a canny socialite who gets off on Il Duce’s lack of sophistication – when they kiss, it’s as if two sentient sink plungers are fighting to the death – but who also has the capacity to humiliate him at her fancy futurist salons. That political authoritarians tend to resent and demean the women in their life comes through strongly in Mussolini’s treatment of his neglected wife and a horribly abused secretary.Cut it in half and Son of the Century would be a potent portrait of a pathetic monster, brilliantly performed and striking to look at. Like the direction, some of the sets are wildly over the top, but the echoing marble mansions, dingy town halls and slums conjure up the right air of sepia-tinted decline, the conditions in which the worst kind of politics can flourish. If only this series could have stuck to its point.Mussolini: Son of the Century airs on Sky Atlantic and is available on NowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionJoe WrightBenito MussolinireviewsShareReuse this content"

In 2010, fashion designer Ron Finley turned neglected areas in his South Central neighbourhood of Los Angeles into vegetable patches. He was ordered to remove them for gardening without a permit but, with a group of activists, fought back and changed the city’s laws. Derek Jarman’s home in Kent, where he lived in his final years and grew plants in an inhospitable garden, has become a pilgrimage site. Many LGBTQ+ people consider it symbolic of successfully existing in an unwelcoming space, much as Jarman had as a queer man under a Conservative government in the 1980s.The transformative power of nature for marginalised communities has a central theme in Lavender, Hyacinth, Violet, Yew, the debut play by nonbinary writer and performer Coral Wylie, staged this month at theBush theatrein London. In this exploration of queerness, generational trauma, family dynamics and, less explicitly, race, gardening serves as a powerful tool for personal and collective healing. “It’s a radical act to garden – to take an outdoor space and make a home out of it,” says the 29-year-old over a video call.The actor-writer from west London joined the Bush theatre in 2021 as part of itsYoung Company initiative, bringing together local storytellers aged 18 to 25. A quick scroll through Wylie’sgreen-filled Instagram pageshows a strong affinity with the natural world, much like Pip, the character they portray in the play. Pip is a queer 19-year-old who has picked up gardening as a hobby from their father, Craig. While rummaging through the attic, Pip comes across a violet jacket previously owned by Craig’s late friend Duncan, a gay man who, like Jarman, died of Aids in the 90s.View image in fullscreen‘It was written for Wayne and for everything that I am because of him’ … Coral Wylie in rehearsal for Lavender, Hyacinth, Violet, Yew.Photograph: Harry ElletsonAccording to Wylie: “The play came to be because my parents had a best friend, Wayne Sterling, who passed away in 1994 from complications with Aids.” Wylie was given his jacket, much like their character in the play. “I grew up being told all about him, how important he was and how much I acted like him.” In the play, Pip finds Duncan’s diary in his jacket pocket with musings about his life and gardening ventures, often with Craig. Duncan compares himself to gorse, a shrub with bright yellow flowers – “twisted branches wrung out like washing”. He admires its “persistence” even in “the bitterest cold”.Wylie reflects on the fact that had they got to know Wayne, they might have discovered themself much sooner. However, they also acknowledge that it was through Wayne’s presence in their parents’ lives that they became who they are today. “In theatre, many people are writing about grief, and it felt important to write about it in this way – it was written for Wayne and for everything that I am because of him.”The discoveries in the attic spark questions about Pip’s parents’ connection to queerness, how their family’s varied interest in gardening came about and the undeniable effects of grief. It’s a Sin actor Omari Douglas is playing Duncan in the production. “There is a simplicity in this kind of human drama about family, loss, grief and identity and people trying to find their place in the world,” he says.The play teeters between 2013 and 1993, between Pip’s world and Duncan in his 30s, two people who never met and were queer at very different times but nevertheless have many similarities. For Douglas, the play shows how, when exploring one’s own identity, “you can bump up against things in the world around you,” he says. He points out that not only do you have to adjust your understanding of yourself and others during this process, but others closest to you are often also “trying to meet you where you are”, which comes with its challenges.These difficulties are particularly apparent to Craig, who struggles to grasp the intricacies of his child’s queerness and finds discomfort in them grappling with their identity through his dead best friend’s belongings and life. This is in stark contrast to when audiences meet Craig with Duncan in the 90s, often gardening together. Their friendship is warm, light and full of mutual understanding, a dynamic Douglas finds heartwarming.“It felt so comforting, seeing two black men from the Caribbean diaspora, one gay and one straight, interacting with each other like this, and the nuances and idiosyncrasies [of their relationship],” he says, highlighting the play’s backdrop of the natural world, upending stereotypes of black men. “To see these black men immersed in that world – eating, sleeping and breathing it – was a fascinating journey.”Lavender, Hyacinth, Violet, Yew is atBush theatre, London, 8 February-22 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreBush theatreGardensfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When I first saw Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain in 2005 – a movie I’d been anticipating since a “gay cowboy” project was announced – my response was subdued. I remember telling a friend who’d asked what I thought that it was beautiful in the way a landscape painting is beautiful: lush and precisely detailed but emotionally spare. These days I can’t hear the opening strains of Gustavo Santaolalla’s poignant score without weeping.Beautiful landscape is, of course, a central feature of the film, tantalising and talismanic. The quietly stunning Wyoming countryside is not only where our cowboys fall in love – mercurial and passionate Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and taciturn and self-loathing Ennis del Mar (Heath Ledger) – it represents the kind of emotional freedom and acceptance they can’t find in the prosaic interiors of their upbringing. Brokeback Mountain (a fictional location invented by the author Annie Proulx in the award-winning short story on which the film is based) releases something in the men, then mocks them for not living up to its Edenic promise.View image in fullscreenJake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain.Photograph: Reuters/Focus FeaturesIt’s highly significant that the film opens in 1963 and spans a 20-year period of marriages, kids and divorce before ending in secrecy and heartbreak. This was a time of enormous progress for gay men in the US who’d fought for and won legal protections across the country. But for Jack and Ennis – who can’t even conceive of a world that tolerates, let alone actively celebrates, their love – this progress might as well be happening on the moon. It’s a salient reminder that what we think of as an LGBTQI+ community is largely a metropolitan, middle-class construct.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThose long opening scenes on Brokeback – where the men herd sheep, wash clothes in the river and make love in a tent – unfold languorously, as if taking their cue from the natural world; the pacing here is stately, deliberate. But as the men return to their separate lives and deep dive into the deception of heterosexuality, time seems to quicken. No sooner do we see Ennis marrying Alma (Michelle Williams) in a pokey Riverton chapel than the couple are drowning under the domestic weight of kids, bills and dead-end jobs. Jack’s furtive “romance” with Lureen (Anne Hathaway, all angles and eye rolls) also proceeds at a pace, as if keen to paper over cracks. Lee does this often in the film, telescoping time whenever the men are away from the mountain; the effect is of whole lives slipping through the protagonists’ fingers.One of the things that strikes me rewatching the film is how specific and tactile the worlds Lee brings to life are (aided enormously by the production designer Judy Becker); from the shoddy trailers and rusted pick-ups of Ennis’s existence to the depressing austerity of Jack’s family home. Lee has always been a master of mise en scène; he uses it not just to locate and excavate character but to suggest elaborate and highly charged social milieux. This is vital in a film like Brokeback Mountain, where societal conventions are as immutable and constrictive as gravity. What we now understand as toxic masculinity, its stultifying narrowness and self-inflicting misery, pervades every frame; rigid constructs surrounding gender are as scrupulously upheld as anything in Edith Wharton or Henry James.The cast are superb, the whole film littered with performances of astonishing depth and suppleness. I’d forgotten Kate Mara’s emergent, wide-eyed Alma Jr, wondering what exactly it is that keeps her father at arm’s length. David Harbour and Anna Faris as hopelessly entrapped married couple Randall and Lashawn Malone. Williams is heartbreaking, doe-eyed and desperate and Hathaway is terrific, her insouciance hardening to steel in the face of her husband’s vast unknowability.View image in fullscreenMichelle Williams as Alma and Heath Ledger as Ennis Del Mar.Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/AlamyStraight actors playing gay characters might have become more controversial since the film’s release (although it’s hardly in abeyance) but this never bothered me much because I could always feel the abiding respect and compassion coming from the entire creative team. Gyllenhaal and Ledger don’t “play gay” at all; the boys’ sexuality isn’t an identity to them, but something akin to a topographical detail, as inscrutable as a mountain.Gyllenhaal is brilliant as the tortured and tenacious Jack, allowing hints of another, freer self to shine through the increasing bitterness and despair. When Brokeback was released, the US film critic Gene Shalit called Jack“a sexual predator”– which highlights the straight world’s willingness to see criminality in gay desire – but he’s really a lover in the high romantic sense, chivalric and steadfast. Ledger’s Ennis is an inversion of Jack, his chivalry petrified into stoicism and self-denial. He mumbles and shuffles, hemmed and corralled like one of the sheep, his jaw locked and his gaze shifting. It’s a remarkable portrait of a young man disappearing into himself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That decision looks downright silly now, as Lee’s film has taken its rightful place among cinema’s masterpieces, entering the Library of Congress’s National Film Registry in 2018 for being “culturally, historically or aesthetically significant”.

Was it art? Was it fashion? Were they even invited?Tue 4 Feb 2025 09.28 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2025 10.52 ESTShareWhat precisely is the deal with Kanye West and his wife, Bianca Censori, whose latest very surprising red-carpet outing very unsurprisingly featured her being next-to-naked? Bianca’s husband, who dresses like a Minecraft security guard, seemed to be giving her the signal to shed her fur coat and reveal herself outsideSunday night’s Grammys, to which they don’t appear to have been invited. Certainly a hot new twist on the old 13th fairy act.Given that Bianca is rarely photographed in anything heavier than a 5-denier sex poncho, half the internet seems to have settled definitively on the conviction that she is being coercively controlled. The other half has decided the pair enjoy the attention their “art project” is receiving. I’m not sure it’s entirely clear which is the case, or indeed whether it’s a bit of both for now, and in any case she may reevaluate her opinions about the situation in retrospect as time goes by.By way of a recap for Guardian readers not obsessed with the byzantine court politics of Yeezy (guys, please: this stuff is important): Kanye and Bianca married in 2023, following the sundering of his union with reality-industrial-complex mogulKim Kardashian. Bianca and Kanye seem to have met via the latter’s previously mentioned fashion brand, where she was hired as the chief architect. Stay with this, because the sneakers Kanye produces are so hideously absurd that they may well have featured mock-Tudor heel gables and Juliet balconies. Even so, being the chief architect of a fashion company does feel a little like being the chief veterinary officer of a teapot factory.Then again maybe all virulent antisemites need a chief architect. I’m not saying Bianca was the Albert Speer of Yeezy, planning ever more triumphalist colonnaded sneakers, only for these dreams to end in rubble when the boss overreached himself. But the fact remained that Kanye’s collaboration with Adidas did end up imploding, shortly after he fired out a barrage of Jew-hate across pretty much every possible platform, appended bythe explainer: “I can literally say antisemitic shit, and they can’t drop me.” Not so, as it turned out. (Maybe he read somesecond world war historybooks and wrongly assumed the old rules of the firm still applied.)These days, the Wests stage regular silent happenings for the paparazzi, which are parsed by everyone from lip-readers to armchair hostage video experts to determine if Bianca is having fun or not. She certainly seemed to be, inan enthusiastic karaoke performanceat a Grammys afterparty – but appearances can be deceptive. There’s rather more to run on this one before the world can know for sure.For now, perhaps we have to take the word of Bianca’s tirelessly curatedpersonal website, which is a strong pusher of the notion that she and Kanye are a mutually supportive pair of performance artists. “While many were initially fascinated by her private life,” it acknowledges of her rise to fame, “her role at Yeezy – West’s fashion brand – quickly became the focus.” Did it though?Perhaps more luck will be had on that front now, thanks to Bianca’s announcement that she is releasing a documentary about herself this year. “The documentary will also highlight her collaborative relationship with Kanye West, focusing on how their creative partnership drives innovation across various fields. While both have kept much of their work under wraps,” it goes on, suggesting a metaphorical fur coat is about to be dropped by both Wests, “this series will offer unprecedented access to their joint creative processes, revealing how Bianca’s architectural sensibility influences Kanye’s futuristic fashion designs.” Righto. The network/streamer on which you’ll be able to view this remains tantalisingly unconfirmed. But I think I’d be more interested in it thanMeghan’s upcoming tablescaping debuton Netflix, if that means anything.In the end, though, the Kanye and Bianca show seems not a lot more than a bi-weekly occasion for drawing attention to staggering creative decline. For someone whose music was once layered and groundbreaking – and look, for someone whose architecture might well have also been layered and groundbreaking – the message of this now fairly long-running exercise in minimal dressing seems embarrassingly pedestrian, based on a somewhat teenage belief that sex is oo-er-rude and transgressive. As an art project, what is its point supposed to be? No offence, but it has about as much depth and nuance as a Banksy or late-stage Damien Hirst – in fact, it makes the actorSydney Sweeney’s funny snapof herself in a grey sweatshirt reading “Sorry for having great tits and correct opinions” look like a Renoir.As for where the show goes next, I have suspected for a while now that one future staging post on this provocative artistic journey will be for Bianca to appear on some red carpet or other wearing a full-body veil, while Kanye remains nice and comfy in his customary T-shirt and trousers. Should this development be realised, it’s hard to know whether people will find it offensively shocking, finally sufficiently modest, or coercive in a different manner. It’ll definitely be a lot harder for them to talk about in the “right” way than nudity is, though. In fact, judging by the full chatterati meltdown over Bianca and Kanye’sGrammysouting, the choice or otherwise of nudity remains much more acceptable to discuss than the choice or otherwise of being fully covered. Perhaps Mr and Mrs West have accidentally made an interesting point after all.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

So go on, Cardinal Bellini, fix us a cocktailStuart HeritageTue 4 Feb 2025 07.21 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2025 11.42 ESTShareConclave, quite rightly, is nominated for a number of Oscars this year. This, I suspect, is down to how successfully it managed to construct a perfectly Oscar-friendly cladding – religion! costumes! meticulous reconstructions of the Vatican! – and wrap it around the silliest story imaginable. We’ll save discussions of the twist for another time, but even without that it’s a story about a bunch of ostensibly serious men acting like gossipy schoolgirls. It’s honestly hilarious.Part of its appeal is in how well it has been cast. Ralph Fiennes gets to play his two best modes – furrowed doubt andLeonard Rossiter– at the same time. John Lithgow gets to be at once avuncular and menacing. Isabella Rossellini gets to tell lots of people that they’ve been very naughty boys. But arguably the best casting, and one weirdly shut out of nominations, is that of Stanley Tucci. And this is because, inConclave, Stanley Tucci plays Stanley Tucci.Conclave review – Ralph Fiennes shines as papal election results in high-camp gripperRead moreThat’s basically it. He’sStanley Tuccifrom books and TV and social media – urbane, sophisticated, conspiratorial – in a funny hat and a dressing gown. When you see Stanley Tucci on screen, you don’t think “Oh, there’s Cardinal Bellini, the clear favourite to become the next pope,” you instead think “Hey, it’s Stanley Tucci! Go on Stanley, make us a negroni.”On the surface, this might seem like something of a problem. After all, the point of being an actor is to disappear into a role. The thrill of watching a great actor is getting to witness a transformation so comprehensive that you quickly forget that you’re watching an actor at all. This is not the case with Stanley Tucci. To watch Stanley Tucci in anything is to watch Stanley Tucci transform into a version of Stanley Tucci who wears slightly different clothes sometimes.Indeed, look at Stanley Tucci’s filmography and you’ll notice that for the last half decade, Stanley Tucci hasn’t really made much of an effort to disappear inside a character. Citadel, What If …?, Inside Man, The Witches; all these performances saw Tucci knowingly adapt to a genre rather than disappearing inside a character. The last time he really did that was in 2020’s excellent Supernova. And even then he was still Stanley Tucci, just a version of Stanley Tucci who didn’t wink at the audience quite as much.View image in fullscreenBread and wine … Tucci in his TV show Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy.Photograph: Production/BBC/Raw TV/Warner MediaThe reason for this, of course, is that Stanley Tucci has outgrown acting. He’s a personality now. Thanks to his books and travel shows and TikToks, Tucci has landed on the best-defined role of his life; a classy sophisticate who appreciates the finer things in life. He’s impeccably dressed and charming enough to make your grandmother giggle into her handkerchief. Forget any of the things he did before, this is now who Stanley Tucci is. And it’s probably impossible to escape.This is fine. It happens sometimes. To watch culture in 2025 is to realise that acting is such a horrible job that all actors ever want to do is find a lucrative side-hustle that will get them out of it. George Clooney has his alcohol. Scarlett Johansson has her cosmetics line. And Stanley Tucci has his travelogues. These are the things that made him into a household name, and there’s nothing wrong with that. If you had the chance to be handsomely paid to do the thing you love most in the world, you’d take it too. Of course you would.‘We create gods because the world is chaos’: Ralph Fiennes, John Lithgow and Stanley Tucci on celebrity, sin and papal thriller ConclaveRead morePlus this isn’t exactly new. Even before he ate his way around Italy for a living, Stanley Tucci was always best when he played Stanley Tucci. His best film remains Big Night, which he co-wrote and co-directed as well as playing the lead. The film drew on Tucci’s love of food. His character demonstrated a lot of traits of the classic Tucci persona. The final scene, one of the all-time great movie endings, is just Stanley Tucci grumpily making an omelette. It’s basically a prototype of his Instagram posts. It’s a great film. If you can be Stanley Tucci as well as Stanley Tucci is Stanley Tucci, why would you ever want to be anything else?However, when you’re primarily famous for sternly telling your wife how to make a cocktail on the internet, that does kind of cut into your ability to play a range of roles. He’s always excelled at camp, as he played in The Devil Wears Prada and Julie & Julia and The Hunger Games. But it’s hard to see him now playing, say, Philippe I, Duke of Orléans as he did in A Little Chaos in 2014. Or Stanley Kubrick, as he did in The Life and Death of Peter Sellers in 2004, or a serial killer paedophile as he did in The Lovely Bones. But hope springs eternal. Stanley Tucci is, as we have established, the world’s best Stanley Tucci. But perhaps Conclave’s return to drama shook something loose in him. Maybe in his next role, he’ll be a little less himself. And then a little less. And then it might be time to start getting excited again.Explore more on these topicsFilmStanley TucciConclaveTelevisionAwards and prizesRalph FiennesJohn LithgowfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The subsidiary has since reduced its stake.More than 1,800 writers, including 2023 winner Sarah Bernstein,signed an open letterin support of the protesters. In July 2024, more than 30 authors who would have been eligible for the prizewithdrew their workfrom consideration. In September, the prize – which had been called the Scotiabank Giller prize –dropped the bankfrom its name.In November, 2024 winnerAnne Michaels was criticisedfor accepting the prize, and for her winner’s speech, which did not mention Palestine or the protests.In Monday’s statement, the Giller Foundation said it was grateful for Scotiabank’s “unwavering support and dedication to Canadian literature”. The foundation’s executive director, Elana Rabinovitch,told the Globe and Mailthat “following discussions, Scotiabank and the Giller Foundation agreed that the best path forward was an early end to the partnership”, but did not give reasons for the termination.

One down, two to go.”Protests against Canadian bookstore chain Indigo have been motivated by its CEO Heather Reisman’s ties to the Heseg Foundation for Lone Soldiers. The charity, which Reisman co-founded in 2005 with her husband, awards scholarships to former IDF members who don’t have family in Israel.The Azrieli Foundation is the charitable arm of the Azrieli Group, Israel’s largest publicly traded real estate company which has holdings in Bank Leumi.

He has featured at the BBC Proms, Aldeburgh festival and Tanglewood.“Margaret Thatcher has been portrayed many times on screen, but never as prime minister on the operatic stage,” said Phibbs.“More than the politics, this is an exploration of Thatcher the woman: her isolation in a world dominated by men; her often fractious relationships with members of her cabinet (notably with Geoffrey Howe); and the dramatic events that led to her resignation.”Mrs T will be directed by Lucy Bradley, with the mezzo-soprano Lucy Schaufer in the title role. The author, journalist and radio presenter Libby Purves will feature as a newsreader, and the casting of other roles including Thatcher’s chancellor Geoffrey Howe and Ronald Reagan will be announced later.More information is expected to be released in the spring and parts of the opera will be showcased this autumn in London.Mrs T is being billed as the “the first ever opera of Thatcher during her time as prime minister” but there have been others. In 2013, an opera subsidised by the French government portrayed her relationship with Gen Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator.Titled Aliados (Allies), that opera opened just outside Paris and focused on her meeting with Pinochet in 1999, when he was under house arrest in London. It was also performed in Strasbourg and Rome.Thatcher was not a huge opera fan but did once tell a Guardian journalist that Handel was one of her favourites because of “all those marvellous tunes”.Explore more on these topicsOperaMargaret ThatcherPolitics pastnewsShareReuse this content"

The National’s submission is Inter Alia, about a judge whose son is accused of rape. The play will be staged this summer in the Lyttelton theatre, starring Rosamund Pike in the lead role. It is written by Australian playwright Suzie Miller, who had a hit with her previous legal drama, Prima Facie, starring Jodie Comer.The Almeida is represented by Otherland, which opens at the north London theatre this month. Written by Chris Bush, whose previous productions include the Sheffield musical Standing at the Sky’s Edge, it is billed as an exploration of “what it means to be true to yourself in the face of unstoppable change”. The cast includes Jade Anouka and Fizz Sinclair.The RSC has already staged the script it submitted for the prize. Playwright Isobel McArthur, best known for her raucous Jane Austen riff Pride and Prejudice* (*sort of), directed her version of The Fair Maid of the West as a Christmas show in the Swan theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, in 2023. It is a musical updating of Thomas Heywood’s 17th-century play of the same name.The Guardian’s David Jayswrote that McArthur had made “a rollicking new romp from a baggy old play”.Other plays on the shortlist offer fresh takes on classic tales. BÁN by Carys Coburn, submitted by Dublin’sAbbey theatre, is inspired by Federico García Lorca’s The House of Bernarda Alba and set in 1980s Ireland. The Janeiad by Anna Ziegler, submitted by the Alley theatre in Houston, draws on the Odyssey, with Penelope becoming New Yorker Jane, whose husband left home 20 years ago.The remaining finalists, chosen from more than 200 submissions, are 49 Days, a play about grief by Haruna Lee, submitted by Playwrights Horizons in New York; An Oxford Man by Else Went, about “the first ‘modern’ transgender man”, from South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa, California; Furlough’s Paradise by ak payne, charting the relationship between two cousins (Alliance theatre of Atlanta); and Keiko Green’s “genre-defying” You Are Cordially Invited to the End of the World (UC San Diego MFA Playwriting Programme).The winner will be announced on 10 March and awarded $25,000 and a signed print by Willem de Kooning. The judges are: costume designer Linda Cho; actors Indira Varma and Jennifer Ehle; Nancy Medina, artistic director of the Bristol Old Vic; playwright Mark Ravenhill; and George Strus, who founded the new work development and community building hubBreaking the Binary theatrein New York.Past winners of the prize include Annie Baker, Caryl Churchill and Lynn Nottage. Last year, it was won by Ava Pickett’s “very funny and very angry” play1536, which follows three women as they discuss the arrest of Anne Boleyn.1536 opens at the Almeida in May.Explore more on these topicsTheatreAwards and prizesNational TheatreAbbey theatreRoyal Shakespeare CompanyAlmeida theatreShareReuse this content"

He also starred as Alvin Smedley in Last of the Summer Wine.Born on 25 September 1932 on the Isle of Wight, he trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art after completing national service with the RAF.He started his career in the 1950s as a member of the Theatre Workshop, founded by Joan Littlewood, and appeared in the stage and 1962 film version of Littlewood’s comedy Sparrows Can’t Sing, the latter starring Barbara Windsor and James Booth. He also performed in first world war musical satire Oh! What a Lovely War.Murphy was a jobbing actor before appearing in TV shows including The Avengers and Z-Cars, with Man About the House being his breakthrough role.He also appeared in ITV sitcom The Incredible Mr Tanner in 1981 and BBC’s L For Lester in 1982. In 1993, he starred in the first major stage version of The Invisible Man, based on the science fiction classic by HG Wells.In the 00s, he portrayed Maurice in The Booze Cruise alongside Martin Clunes and Neil Pearson, and from 2011 he appeared in The Café.He appeared on a host of other TV shows including comedy series The Catherine Tate Show, Benidorm and This Is Jinsy. In later years, he voiced the character Mr Lovelybuns for the animated series Claude, based on Alex T Smith’s bestselling books.Murphy had shot scenes for a comedy series in November last year and was due to start filming for a feature film, with a working title of The Last Goodbye, directed by Jason Figgis about “life late in life”, his agent said. Mr Bowington said Regan still planned to star in the film but they would “need to take a breath first” before casting her co-star as he said “Brian is not easily replaced”.Murphy is survived by his wife and two sons.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV comedynewsShareReuse this content"

But shortly after his wins, as he moved backstage towards the red carpet area, he was arrested and detained after an altercation with what Render later described as “an overzealous security guard”.In July, the Los Angeles City Attorney’s office said it would not file charges against Render over the incident.Render is now suing S&S Labor Force, alleging false arrest and imprisonment, assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligence. The lawsuit,quoted by Rolling Stone, alleges that Render made “multiple attempts to clarify his identity and purpose for being in that secured area” but was ignored and restrained.“Defendants then surrounded plaintiff with multiple security guards and wrongfully detained plaintiff and confined his movements through physical force. Defendants used their position of authority to degrade, embarrass and physically hurt plaintiff in public view, subjecting him to emotional distress and public humiliation,” it states.Render is seeking a trial, and eventual damages.‘I will never be against the second amendment’: Run the Jewels’ Killer Mike on rap, racism and gun controlRead moreA spokesperson for S&S Labor Force, who operate as JRM Security, has responded, saying that while the company employed security guards at theGrammysthat year, they “unequivocally state that we had zero involvement in the incident described”.They added: “S&S Labor Force Inc takes pride in our commitment to ethical practices and the safety of our employees, clients, and guests. We have thorough protocols in place to ensure all actions taken by our security personnel adhere to the law and our company standards. The claim in question appears to be based on misinformation and lacks credible evidence.” The company said they were investigating the allegations.In July, Killer Mike released a song titled Humble Me which reflected on his arrest, including the lyrics: “I was sitting there in a room full of cops, like Daniel was sitting with the lions / I had to quiet my mind, I prayed and I prayed and I prayed / The liars were lying their lies, I kept on just keeping my faith”. It was included on his most recent album,Michael & the Mighty Midnight Revival: Songs for Sinners and Saints.Explore more on these topicsKiller MikeRun the JewelsRapHip-hopGrammysAtlantanewsShareReuse this content"

Eshe (Evlyne Oyedokun) hasn’t left the flat in days. Instead, she sits on her bed and rows. As her surroundings are submerged in oceanic blue light, waves crash behind her, and she swigs brandy from a hip flask. She is by herself and floating through unknown waters, but here she’s also free to express her pain on her own terms. “I want to be alone, with my own breath and that,” she says.The play, which was a finalist for theWomen’s prize for playwriting, theBruntwood prizeand theAlfred Fagon award, is a full-throttled immersion inside Eshe’s head. We hear the voice and feel the almost suffocating presence of her dead mother, Sissy (Danielle Kassaraté). The room is covered in crisp packets, empty takeaway boxes and dirty laundry, but her focus is averted elsewhere. Eshe is bombarded by text messages, and her loved ones, Ella (Olivia Nakintu)and Michael (Ivan Oyik), beg to be let into her space, but no one seems to know the right way to reach out and love her in the way she needs.View image in fullscreenOlivia Nakintu and Ivan Oyik as Ella and Michael in …blackbird hour.Photograph: Seye IsikaluAt its best, this is a formally daring 90-minute play, which pours out like urgent poetry. But, under the direction of malakaï sargeant, it takes a while for the tension to take hold. On a screen on the stage’s back wall, words are projected and then dissolve like inconsequential matter. As Eshe, Oyedokun hauntingly slurs her speech, but some of its meaning is lost in the process. The result is a dizzying painting of isolation, aided by lots of intricate design elements by Khadija Raza. The overall visual effect is powerful, but the clarity isn’t always there.By its close, the play achieves its sting as Michael and Ella transform into manic clown-like figures, almost begging for Eshe’s “mental prison” to come to an end. Both revelatory and disturbing, it leaves the theatre profoundly chilled.AtBush theatre, London, until 1 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreBush theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a tale of love and mistaken identity, with plenty of farcical hiding in cupboards to avoid the scandal of being caught in a compromising position, and we even get the time-honoured business of having sex with the wrong person in pitch darkness – a plot point stretching back to Jacobean drama.It’s a wacky love triangle. In 1937 Shanghai, with the Japanese about to invade, a young would-be songwriter nicknamed Do-Re-Mi (Kenny Bee) is humiliatingly employed as a clown in a nightclub and figures he might as well join the army. In the chaos caused by the appearance of Japanese fighter planes, he meets-cute under Suzhou Bridge with delicate, vulnerable Shu-Shu (played by Sylvia Chang, who recently appeared in Jia Zhang-ke’s Mountains May Depart and Bi Gan’s Long Day’s Journey Into Night).In the moment, they fall in love and swear to meet under the same bridge after the war. Fast-forward 10 years and peacetime Shanghai is hit with hyperinflation (a currency situation mimicking the action’s accelerated craziness), and Do-Re-Mi now plays the tuba in a military band – with much broad comedy caused by his tuba hitting people when he bows to them. He is yearningly looking for Shu-Shu, but she is now an unrecognisably glamorous and elegant nightclub singer, a transformation coolly managed by Chang. Do-Re-Mi doesn’t realise who she is, even though they live in the same building, and now Shu-Shu’s ditsy, scatterbrained roommate Stool falls in love with him. She is played by Sally Yeh with some lovably over-the-top wide-eyed comic acting.If Tsui really is the Chinese Steven Spielberg, as pundits say, then maybe Shanghai Blues ought to be shown in a double-bill with Empire of the Sun; it’s strange to think that Shanghai Blues is effectively set before and after the action of that film, and yet the sense of liberating chaos and craziness in this westernised place is not a million miles from the seriousEmpire of the Sun. There are some great scenes in Shu-Shu’s nightclub as she contemptuously spurns the attentions of lecherous businessman Mr To, who is, however, reluctant to be too upset with her. As he explains to the nightclub owner: “Never insult a woman, she may become your boss’s wife.”Shanghai Blues is on Mubi from 5 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsWar filmsHong KongPeriod and historical filmsRomance filmsWorld cinemareviewsShareReuse this content"

Gazing at Fly Davis’s vast white cube of a set, audiences may be reminded of the dazzling limbo where the last scrap of Voldemort’s soul is found in the final Harry Potter film. Don’t mention that to Martin, the affable but intense fellow pacing around the stage. As a child, he got down to the last two in the auditions to play Harry. He believed he had put the disappointment behind him. But when he faints during his pregnant girlfriend’s ultrasound, the shock unlocks a whole chamber of secrets.View image in fullscreenWhooshing things along … Asa Butterfield in Second Best.Photograph: Hugo GlendinningIn Michael Longhurst’s spare production, augmented by Paule Constable’s forensic lighting and Richard Hammarton’s unsettling score and sound design, Martin is going up the wall. Literally so at one point, when he clambers on top of a wardrobe to reach the hospital bed high above him, which protrudes from the set like a poking tongue. In what appears to be a surrealist sculpture, packets of crisps tumble from their rack in a frozen cascade. Like the baked potato taped to the wall, and the camcorder that Martin turns on the audience in a kind of lo-tech riposte to Ivo van Hove, these turn out to be the building blocks of his neurosis.Norris dismantles those blocks with care, though there remain a few areas where insight is lacking. Observations about the downside of fame, the bullet that Martin dodged, tend toward the banal, and the characterisation of his girlfriend as a holy saviour is simplistic. She’s even a doctor: healing is her profession. What if she were in HR?Making his stage debut, Sex Education’sAsa Butterfieldwhooshes the action along, moving economically between characters (his switch to playing Martin’s stepfather is all in the shoulders) and exuding a charm that is never ingratiating. Indeed, there is real finesse in his ability to inhabit a man who is in need without seeming needy. Parts of this one-person play could be fortified and fleshed-out, but no one could apply its title to his performance.AtRiverside Studios, London, until 22 February.Explore more on these topicsTheatreAsa ButterfieldreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now Pilkey’s bestselling Dog Man books (a spin-off of the Captain Underpants series) have been turned into a noisy, fun movie. First thing to overcome is the ick factor in the origin tale of how Dog Man came to have a man’s body and a dog’s head. The story goes that after a bomb explosion critically injures a police officer and his trusty canine sidekick, a nurse decides the only thing for it is to sew the dog’s head on to the officer’s body.The resulting supercop is Dog Man, brought to screen in Pilkey’s hand-drawn Sharpie pen style. The Franken-pooch operation is a bit much for the policeman’s girlfriend, who leaves him for another man. Then Dog Man’s nemesis, Petey “the world’s most evilest cat”, busts out of jail. The fact that Petey speaks (and is voiced so entertainingly by Pete Davidson) makes him immediately twice as interesting as Dog Man, who only talks in woofs (barked by director Peter Hastings). With his daddy issues and parenting failures, Petey is also the emotional centre of the movie.The anarchic plot finds Petey buying a cloning machine to better his chances of world domination. The result is a cute little kitten clone called Li’l Petey (Lucas Hopkins Calderon), that he is too emotionally damaged to parent. Petey abandons the little guy in a cardboard box.Dog Man is packed with goofy gags that whizz past, with no let up from the hectic pace. It’s a movie with the energy levels of a classroom of six-year-olds on the last day of summer term – though it didn’t really have the kids packed into my screening laughing out loud. Though credit to the dad sitting at the end of the row who managed to rest his eyes for 80 minutes of the noisy, frenetic 89-minute running time.Dog Man is out in the US now, in the UK from 7 February, and in Australia from 3 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmFamily filmsFilm adaptationsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, Tyler’s novels are records of the numerous ways people get things wrong and learn to live with it, and how the wrong things have a sneaky habit, eventually, of turning out to be right.Take Gail and Max, who are familiar types from Tyler’s work. She is an orderly worrier, a little abrupt, “right-angled”, who cuts her own hair for fear of the chitchat she gets in the salon. Max, on the other hand, is a big, messy, boundaryless but kind-hearted man who generates “hillocks of clutter” wherever he sits. They could represent the twin impulses – of connection and withdrawal – that have lapped at Tyler’s novels like the tides eroding and shaping a coastline. Though they divorced many years before, Max and Gail have been brought together by the wedding of their 33-year-old daughter, Debbie. The day before the wedding, Max turns up at Gail’s house in the outskirts of Baltimore with a duffel bag slung over his shoulder and an old cat in need of a home, and at first, Gail is of a mind to put neither of them up. “I didn’t even want a house plant. I had reached the stage in life where I was done with caretaking.”But Max is covered in dander and the groom is allergic to cats, so stay with Gail he must. Tyler gets much gentle comedy from the way Gail is both irritated by and drawn to her ex-husband, who nibbles at everything in the fridge, parks his car too close to hers and leaves the front door open, but also helps her negotiate what turns out to be a rocky few days as a bombshell strikes: news of a recent infidelity rocks the bride-to-be on the eve of her wedding. Max is ready to take his cue from whatever their daughter has decided but Gail is up in arms about it, for reasons that have to do with the end of her own marriage, we find out. Form follows emotional function, as always in Tyler’s books. A hiccup in the wedding plans of their daughter proves the perfect place for all the unresolved feelings around Gail and Max’s own abruptly truncated marriage to pool.Her characters are so alive they could be sitting next to you telling you what happened to them last TuesdayAt just 176 pages,Three Days in Juneis, if not her shortest, then a return to the more attenuated form of Tyler’s early novels, before she unfurled those big, capacious 400-pagers about Baltimore families –Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant,The Accidental Tourist,Saint Maybe– that proved Tyler’s mastery. The sprawl and spread of family life appears to have undergone the abbreviation of form that comes with the empty nest, but Tyler’s powers of observation, empathy, wit and depth of insight have suffered no attendant diminution.Three Days in Junetakes two days to read, but it envelops you just the same, her characters so alive they could be sitting next to you telling you what happened to them last Tuesday – and the ending is a beauty.Given how much she has written about marriage, it is perhaps surprising that Tyler has not written more frequently about infidelity – certainly, she lacks the heavy-breathing obsession that male counterparts such as John Updike and Philip Roth brought to the subject – but it is typical that the guilty party in Max and Gail’s marriage was unable to live with themselves, rather than the other way around. Otherwise, Max and Gail seem to fit together so well that, by the end of the book, you are willing them back together with your every fibre – though Gail might still end up with just the cat. It says everything about Tyler’s talents as a novelist that both outcomes are equally plausible and equally possible, until the very last word of the very last sentence of this wise, wonderful book.Three Days in Juneby Anne Tyler is published by Chatto & Windus (£14.99).

It’s almost certainly getting a release now here in the UK because its lead, Zoe Saldaña, is up for an Academy Award forEmilia Pérezin which, like this one, she plays a Mexican woman.Here Saldaña is a strip club employee named Esmee on the run to El Norte after she kills a client, so this at least shows off her range a bit. As it happens, this was also directed and co-written by Saldaña’s real-life husband, Italian film-maker Marco Perego, who certainly ensures the missus is beautifully lit in every shot and gets a big climactic emotional speech near the end. Not that it’s possible to take a bad shot of Saldaña, even when she’s wearing drab normie clothes and barely a lick of makeup.As Esmee’s journey progresses from Mexico to the US where she must survive sexual harassment and worse, and ends up looking after a little girl whose mother gets lost along the way, the other half of the film focuses on the travails of ICE agent Shipp (Garrett Hedlund), a clenched up cop who falls in love with schoolteacher Yadira (Adria Arjona, the breakout star of Richard Linklater’sHit Man). By inches, the two storylines eventually converge, and all the lead actors are pretty good and well-enough directed by Perego. But there’s a grim, hopeless flatness about the script’s tragedy-flecked momentum, timely enough these days but not exactly moving the conversation along. Kudos is due, however, to whoever trained the beautiful black coyote in a key scene near the end.Beyond the Borders is on digital platforms from 3 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersZoe SaldañaMexicoAmericasreviewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.We could be in south-east Asia, but this fairytale world of time-honoured custom and lives lived close to the land is a lot nearer home – in south-eastern Europe.We are in Romania’s Maramureș region, close to the Ukraine border, driving through rolling hills whose gonk-like haystacks give the countryside a cosy feel, as if it’s peopled with friendly long-haired beings.Romania mapAnd we’ll get to sleep in one of those old wooden houses thanks to an energetic pair of German immigrants. Volker Bulitta and his architect wife Lilli Steier came to the area on a hiking holiday just months after the 1989 revolution and fell in love with it. There were no tourist maps in those post-Communist days, and the few hotels were dire, but local people offered a warm welcome, generously sharing their homes and communal pots of stew. They were soon regular visitors to the village of Botiza, and in 2005 bought the land that is now the heart of their Şesuri estate, and an old wooden house to renovate.A common wedding wish in Romania isCasă de piatră(I wish you a house of stone), because that represents progress and security. For years no one wanted to live in a wooden home like their grandparents, and beautiful examples lay neglected everywhere. Lilli and Volker started buying them and reassembling them on their land – with modern comforts. Lilli became an expert in traditional construction.Now there are four guest cottages on the 100-hectare estate. Ours is 200-year-oldCasa Palaga, which has original ceilings and doors, a huge sitting room with books, art and handmade rugs, and ladder-like steps to two bedrooms and a modern bathroom. A ceramic stove keeps it cosy at night, though the spring sunshine is warm.The first morning we set out to walk the estate, admiring wild woods of oak and silver birch, a clear stream in its rocky bed and hundreds of butterflies, as well as Volker and Lilli’s organically reared horses, goats, buffaloes and friendly, vocal herd of highland cattle.View image in fullscreenInside one of the wooden houses on the Şesuri estate.Photograph: Sorin MorarThe estate meadows are gently mowed with hand scythes, which means in spring they are a riot of rare orchids, marsh marigolds, gladioli and purply-blue salvia that look like giant bluebells. Autumn means wild mushrooms, which guests are encouraged to gather. Lilli, an expert on these as on much else, will advise on those safe to eat. Brown bears, wolves, lynx, wild cats, otters and deer populate the nearby hills. We see no sign of these, but spot what I swear is an eagle high above. We hear a chiffchaff’s distinctive call and listen for hoopoes and orioles arriving from Africa.The otherworldly nature of Maramureș is underlined by its extraordinary churches and monasteries. With steep roofs and impossibly tall turrets, watchtowers and the slenderest spires – all tiled in wood – they look as if CGI whiz kids from Amazon’s Rings of Power were trying to win a bet with Disney.The estate meadows are gently mowed with hand scythes, which means in spring they are a riot of rare orchidsOur walk takes us past Botiza’s monastery, a very elvish complex of pointy towers and swooping wooden arcades, and over the following days we take in several more. A short distance east, Leud church is the oldest of the area’s eight Unesco-listed wooden churches. Built in 1628, it has a double-layer roof, and every inch of its interior is exuberantly painted with saints, devils, animals, trees and flowers.TheMaramureș Village Museumin Sighet, about 25 miles west, has a collection of wooden houses from several districts and centuries, rebuilt on site along a winding lane. Hearing that the three-metre-wide oak planks that make up the walls of the oldest house there, from the early 1500s, were from trees planted just as the Roman empire was collapsing puts our short human lives into context.View image in fullscreenCiorbă – traditional Romanian meatball soup.Photograph: Florin P/AlamyAs does the region’s quirkiest attraction – the Happy Cemetery in Săpânța, farther west again. Death is part of life is its cheerful message. The site is crowded with carved wooden grave markers bearing bright naive paintings of that occupant’s life – weaving, cooking, teaching, bookkeeping, lumberjacking – or death, in a road accident, say, all by local artistStan Ioan Pătraș. One begs visitors to speak quietly so as not to wake his harridan of a mother-in-law, buried nearby, who will make his life a misery even in death.That churches are all well-kept and -used tells of the importance Orthodox Christianity has in the area, but this has knock-on benefits for anyone worried that eastern European country food might be stodgy and meat-heavy. Strict fasting rules in Orthodox lent (3 March-19 April this year) prohibit meat for the whole period, and dairy or eggs on many days, which means local food includes tasty vegan dishes, such aszacuscă, a sort of spreadable ratatouille, and spicy red chilli jam.I have fast fibre-optic internet indoors, but people passing by outside with a horse and cart. It’s so coolThese are found in home cooking, mostly. The Ceaușescu years are long over, but there’s still no dining-out culture in rural areas. There’s a village shop in Botiza for basic supplies, but no cafe, bar or restaurant. However, we’re cheered to learn that its handful ofpensiunea(guesthouses) do dinner for non-residents. At Cretuca, just down the road, we are the only customers in a dining room hung with folk art, and for under £10 a head tuck into a set menu ofciorbă, traditional sour vegetable soup, then tender slices of stewed beef with mash and a big dish of gherkins. And though Romania is a big wine producer, the table is set with a jug of schnapps (“for the man”), and another of blueberry liqueur – for me, apparently.View image in fullscreenA world of time-honoured custom and lives lived close to the land.Photograph: Sorin MorarWe don’t stray far fromCasa Palagain our final days: loungers and a hammock slung between trees offer great valley views, hydrangeas and lavender are starting to flower, and wood smoke curls above the village. There’s anotherpensiuneato try – in nearby Poienile – where we eat festive favouritesarmales(cabbage rolls with pork and rice) and another variety ofciorbă, and we drop in on Maria, who is keeping alive the regional weaving tradition.“This is winter work,” says the former teacher, showing how she spins raw wool, dyes it with, say, mint, walnuts, red onions, cherry juice or nettles, then uses a hand loom and patterns drawn on squared paper to make blankets, rugs and clothing. “It’s more pleasure than labour,” she adds. “I feel much happier like this – my hands busy with wool and plants, rather than phone and laptop.”But despite these timeless elements, Romania is far from stuck in the past. Its tech sector is booming, and the country hassome of the highest internet speeds in Europe. The cute wooden houses could play a part in its future too. Last year saw record heatwaves in Romania, but a neighbour who has a wooden house rebuilt to Lilli’s specifications is very happy. “When it’s 35C outside, it’s a pleasant 23C inside, as wood is a great insulator.
