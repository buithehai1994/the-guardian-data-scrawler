Though, as the Epstein files reveal daily, the top 0.01% were hardly primly biting their tongues before Trump’s win, at least not in private. Those with telephone-number fortunes and great power felt able to speak, and write, to each other about womenin language so vicious, so filled with hate – women discussed as body parts, as “less than human”, inGordon Brown’s apt phrase– that they didn’t need the encouragement of a “grab ’em by the pussy” president to cast off their inhibitions.Still, as that unnamed banker made clear to the FT, women are not the only group the powerful and privileged have been itching to disparage. This week it was migrants who were the target, accused by the billionaire Monaco resident Sir Jim Ratcliffe of having“colonised”Britain.He may have got his stats wrong – he was in quite a muddle about the size of the UK population – but he did usefully debunk one stubbornly persistent assumption. For a while, it was taken as read that anti-immigrant sentiment was a function of economic anxiety: indeed, that was the instant explanation offered for Trump’s victory in 2016. But Ratcliffe, whose fortune is estimated at £17bn, won’t be feeling too much angst in the economic department. That is truer still of Elon Musk, who is simultaneously the backer of anti-immigration parties across Europe and the world’s richest man.Indeed, the data shows no correlation at all between hostility to immigration and income. In January,Ipsos found that it was the most affluent fifthof voters in Britain who, more than any other group, named immigration as their most pressing concern.The increasingly uninhibited musings of the super-rich are, alas, just one factor in a shift that is becoming ever more apparent. While of course we must say that Sir Jim’s comments did not specify the racial origins of immigrants, that’s inevitably how they were heard.We are, in the words of Sunder Katwala, who as the director of the British Future thinktank observes these trends more keenly than most,“going backwards on racism”.The evidence is all around you. It’s there in the116,000 hate crimes recorded by police in England and Wales, but excluding London, for the year to March 2025 – up on the previous year, and a fifth of it involving violence.It’s there in the “ugly”, 1970s-style racism directed at NHS staff, incidents of verbal and physical abuse based on skin colour so frequent that thehealth secretary, Wes Streeting, warned last Novemberthat it was becoming “socially acceptable to be racist”.It’s there in a changed public discourse, where the bounds of acceptability have shifted to include notions that most thought had been left behind two generations ago. Suddenly there’s a debate, drawing in mainstream commentators, overwhether Rishi Sunak is English. A former cabinet minister, Robert Jenrick, can lament not seeing“another white face”in a Birmingham neighbourhood. A former prime minister, Liz Truss, appears as a guest on an online show where she chats withConnor Tomlinson, who believes, among other things, that British citizens from ethnic minorities should not be allowed to become members of parliament. The Sun’s Harry Cole hosts that same far-right figure onhis online show.It’s there on social media, where it has become routine to hurl the P-word at politicians from the Tories’ Priti Patel to Labour’s Shabana Mahmood, from onetime Corbynite Zarah Sultana to Reform’s Zia Yusuf. And it’s there in the daily, lived experience of Britain’s minorities, measurable in both data and anecdote. Figuresreleased this week, for example, showed yet another rise in antisemitic incidents, including a spike straight after October’s deadly attack on a synagogue in Heaton Park, Manchester, which left two dead on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar – more than half of that spike made up of incidents directly referring to, orcelebrating, the killings at Heaton Park. Last autumn, Katwala wrote: “I personally get so much more racist abuse most weeks in 2025 than I ever did in 2005.”Of course, there will be multiple and varied explanations for all this, but there are a few common threads. When it comes to the discourse, the shaping effect of online influencers is unmistakable. The likes of Tomlinson would once have been handing out badly stencilled leaflets in pub backrooms. Now he can reach millions, with TV production values previously the exclusive preserve of the major broadcasters. But the medium affects the message.Put simply, the loudmouths of the far right are competing in an attention economy. Saying something shocking wins attention, but to keep it they have to say something more shocking still. There is a ratchet effect, which ensures the conversation becomes ever more extreme. Note the latest effusion from the white supremacist US influencer Nick Fuentes. Holocaust denial worked for him for a while, but his audience demands more. This week, he provided it by directing his fire at women, whom he castigated for encouraging sympathy for the poor and minorities.“The number one political enemy in America is women,”he told his audience on the Rumble platform. And so, “Every woman and girl is sent to the gulags. We will determine who the good ones are after the fact.” But first, to the gulags. “They go to the breeding gulags.”These figures should be far beyond the fringe, but they keep getting amplified. Tucker Carlson hosted Fuentes on his show; Musk regularly promotes some of Britain’s most extreme voices, including Advance UK, a political party that now includes Tommy Robinson and that vows to ban indefinite leave to remain, ban the foreign-born from becoming British citizens and encourage all settled migrants to leave. Musk seems to thinkAdvance is the real deal, preferable to the “weak sauce” of Nigel Farage. All the while, hisX platform barely stirsas users racially abuse others, in the foulest language.Throw in the brain-boiling effect of the pandemic period, when a small, extremely online minority became radicalised by conspiracy theories of every flavour, with anti-vax talk as the gateway drug, and you have some of the causes of this retrograde shift.It’s important to hold on to the fact that most people do not think this way, that attitudes of tolerance are now deeply embedded in Britain: the data shows that too. Still, that led too many to become complacent, to assume that this was a problem of our past, one that we’d solved. But racism and prejudice are not like that. The battles against them have to be fought, and re-fought, in every generation. They are light sleepers – and some loud, powerful voices are determined to shake them awake.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Germany’s Philipp Raimund sat it out – he suffers from vertigo. “From time to time, I have the issue that my body is reacting without me controlling it,” he said. “It’s like I am just observing myself while something has a tight grip on me.”Still without a World Cup win on his CV heading to these Games, the 25-year-old Raimund stunned the field, including sixth-placed Prevc, and himself to win gold in Monday’s normal hill individual event with jumps of 135.6m and 138.5m. “I don’t know how I did it but I’m so, so proud that I managed to do it,” he said.

The 38-year-old is working with 16 skaters from 13 countries at Milano Cortina, seven of whom competed in one night during the men’s short programme – sometimes in immediate succession, requiring rapid changes of allegiance and attire. His costume swaps are coordinated behind the scenes, with jackets stored in dressing rooms or held by team staff to ensure he reaches each skater in time and is ready in the proper team colours at the “kiss-and-cry”, which is well equipped with conveniently placed Puffs tissues, a sponsor for US figure skating, for happy or sad tears.Richaud has choreographed routines inspired by Vincent van Gogh and Henri Matisse, and sees his role as a form of storytelling. “I will not be satisfied if my work as a choreographer will be only to do choreography,” he said. “I always try to bring stories. I always try to make people feel an emotion.” Coaching multiple Olympic hopefuls is, perhaps, as demanding as competing – only multiplied 16-fold.View image in fullscreenBenoît Richaud with Georgia’s Nika Egadze (left) and Maxim Naumov of the United States.Composite: Reuters; Aflo/Shutterstock3The moonwalker of MilanOne of curling’s latest viral stars is not an athlete, but the man behind the making of the ice. Mark Callan, the head ice technician at Milano Cortina, has captured global attention with the moonwalk-like step he performs while “pebbling” the surface, earning the Glaswegian the nickname “the Michael Jackson of curling”. “The viral thing has been a bit of a surprise,” Callan said.“Everybody has a different style of pebbling, bit like driving a car. I find that doing the moonwalk – or the shuffle, if you like – it keeps me stable.” Beyond the internet fame lies meticulous craftsmanship. Using purified Dolomite water, Callan and his team layer and texture each sheet to create the tiny frozen bumps that allow stones to curl, monitoring temperature, humidity and frost with scientific precision. The work is relentless, stretching to 17-hour days throughout the Games.View image in fullscreenThe curling technician Mark Callan performs his style of pebbling ahead of the men’s round robin matches.Photograph: Al Bello/Getty Images4Banned wax stops Korean skiersThe Korea Ski Association was left “perplexed” after two of its cross-country skiers were disqualified from the women’s sprint classic. Han Dasom and Lee Eui-jin had their qualifying times voided when their skis tested positive for fluorinated wax, a substance banned by the International Ski and Snowboard Federation since 2019. The Japanese snowboarder Shiba Masaki was also removed from the men’s parallel giant slalom for the same reason.The non-biodegradable wax, commonly known as fluor, had been used in skiing since the 1980s to help with glide but was banned by the FIS because of the damage it does to the environment and the potential risk to technicians applying the substance in unventilated areas.“The athletes’ products are not fluorine wax,” said a representative from the Korean association. “They tested negative in all previous international competitions with no prior issues. We are also perplexed.” In any case, neither Han nor Lee posted a time quick enough to qualify for the final.View image in fullscreenLee Eui-jin had a qualifying time voided.Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty Images5The well-trodden rollerblading pathErin Jackson of the USA wowed followers of the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang after she qualified for the 500m in the speed skating after only four months of gaining experience on ice. Her transition into the sport was made easy by her experience of inline skating and roller derby. She finished sixth in the 1,000m final on Monday and sets out to defend her 2022 Olympic title in the 500m on Sunday.Others to follow in her footsteps in these Games include Singapore’s giant slalom skier Faiz Basha, who grew up in Switzerland but had to mimic skiing on rollerblades when he could not train on snow during his mandatory military service in the country of his parents, and Daniel Milagros, who has become Spain’s first Olympic speed skater and finished second in the one-lap sprint at the world inline skating championships in 2023. Milagros came last in the men’s 1,000m in Milan but his compatriot and fellow rollerblader Nil Llop, a Winter Olympic medallist at youth level, goes in the 500m on Saturday.View image in fullscreenErin Jackson of the United States competes in the women’s 1,000m speedskating.Photograph: Luca Bruno/AP6Fans scramble for pins and toy stoatsThere is one sport in Italy that is not handing out medals but that does not mean competitors go home empty handed. Throughout the Games, residents and visitors in Milan have been setting off each morning on a race to grab limited edition Olympic pins. An Instagram post at 8am every day tells people – “walk, don’t run” – which of the city’s seven neighbourhoods or five landmarks to head to, where the tourism promoter YesMilano gives out 250 pins. Once they’re gone, they’re gone.Official Olympic merchandise, a lot of which has sold out already, is hot property despite its often extortionate pricing. Perhaps the best chance of nabbing a soft toy of the stoat mascot Tina (selling for €18 to €58; £15-£50) is to actually win a medal – the athletes are given one on the podium. Tommaso, the two-year-old son of Italy’s speed-skating star Francesca Lollobrigida,was more interested in Tinathan his mother’s gold medal.View image in fullscreenPin trading at the Olympics is a longstanding tradition where athletes, officials and fans exchange collectible pinsPhotograph: Maja Hitij/Getty Images7Like mother, like sonFew Olympic stories capture the generational spirit of sport quite like that of the Mexican alpine skier Sarah Schleper and her son, Lasse Gaxiola. Days before her 47th birthday, Schleper became the oldest woman to compete in Olympic alpine skiing when she raced in the super-G in her seventh Winter Games appearance. Across the Alps in Bormio, the 18-year-old Gaxiola is preparing for his Olympic debut in the men’s slalom, making them the first mother-son duo to compete at the sameWinter Olympics.“For him, everything’s new,” Schleper said. “And for me, I know it.” Their shared presence is the culmination of a lifetime in the sport: Schleper debuted in 1998 and competed for the United States, briefly retired, then switched allegiances to Mexico, while Gaxiola grew up on skis and earned his place through junior competition success. “For me, success is simply the fact that we are both here,” Schleper said.View image in fullscreenSarah Schleper holds her son Lasse in a December 2011 World Cup slalom event in Austria.Photograph: Armando Trovati/AP8Brazil bobsleigher’s big book bidBrazil’s Edson Bindilatti embodies perseverance in a sport far removed from his nation’s tropical roots. A veteran of six Winter Olympics, spanning Salt Lake 2002 to Milano Cortina 2026, the 46-year-old has competed as a push athlete, brakeman and pilot, achieving Brazil’s best Olympic bobsleigh finish with 20th place in the four-man event in Beijing and a historic 13th at the world championships in 2025.Inspired by Cool Runnings, the film loosely based on the debut of the Jamaican national bobsleigh team, Bindilatti endured financial hardship, long journeys, personal loss and pandemic-era training improvisations to sustain a career now stretching beyond two decades. “It would make a big book, 500 pages or more, if I were to tell all the stories,” he said in 2014.

Last November, the International Olympic Committee edged closer to implementing a ban on transgender women competing in the female category in time for the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.The 23-year-old Lundholm was born female and now identifies as a man but has not undergone any gender-affirming treatment or surgery. While this proposed ban will affect other transgender athletes, Lundholm would still be able to compete in the women’s category because it is the same gender he was assigned at birth. “I want everyone to be able to compete fairly against each other,” he said after finishing his run down the Livigno course.View image in fullscreenElis Lundholm at a women’s freestyle skiing moguls training session.Photograph: Vegard Grøtt/Bildbyrån/Shutterstock10The end of snow?While the action on snow continues to enthral, a pressing question lingers in the background: will there come a point when there is no snow left to compete on? Climate change is increasingly reshaping the Winter Olympics, as declining snowfall and rising temperatures cast doubt over how and where the Games can be staged in decades to come. Before the Games several athletes signed a petition urging the IOC to end sponsorships with fossil fuel companies. The Italian oil company Eni is one of this year’s sponsors.“I’m not that old but I’m old enough to see changes in where I’ve skied in my life,” said the American Alex Hall after winning silver in freeski slopestyle. “We’ve had events cancelled because of a lack of snow. I’ve seen first-hand the effects. I know it’s not easy for an athlete to say, because we travel a lot and do things that don’t help the situation, so it’s a mixed emotion. If we can trend towards a better future, that’s the plan, that’s the hope.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For every career highlight Shaft or Superfly, there’s a plethora of soundtrack albums that carry the tang of the side-hustle. It was doubtless flattering to be asked in the first place – who doesn’t want to feel like a polymath? – but the results are doomed to languish in the footnotes, alongside the compilations of B-sides and outtakes, where only diehard fans spend extended amounts of time.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Wuthering Heights.Photograph: Jaap Buitendijk/APBut the release of House, the first single taken from Charli xcx’s soundtrack to Wuthering Heights, strongly suggested that its author saw Emerald Fennell’s take on Emily Brontë as a chance for a reset. In2024’s Brat,she made an album you could genuinely call era-defining without fear of embarrassment: if an album makes an impact on the US presidential campaign and its title ends up refashioned as an adjective in the Collins English Dictionary, then it’s definitely era-defining.But Charli has spent the last year declaring said era over, which seems a very smart move indeed – better to release an era-defining album than a career-defining one – and clearly viewed the opportunity to work on a film set out on the wild and windy moors of 19th-century Yorkshire as an opportunity to really move on. As she wryly noted, Catherine and Heathcliff’s doomed romance plays out “without a cigarette or a pair of sunglasses in sight”.Certainly, dark, small-g gothic and bearing the influence of Nine Inch Nails, House sounds almost nothing like the music on Brat.John Cale’s impact on the track seems to go far further than his spoken-word guest vocal: there are obvious echoes of the Velvet Underground in its droning strings and shards of feedback. The rest of the Wuthering Heights soundtrack isn’t as dramatic a departure – its Auto-Tuned vocals and plethora of smart pop melodies immediately mark it out as the work of Charli – but nor does House feel like a radical outlier on the album.Charli xcx: House ft John Cale – videoIts musical aesthetic – and indeed Cale’s influence – weaves around the other songs here. Ominous drones regularly undercut the songs, as on Wall of Sound or Eyes of the World, the latter a standout collaboration withAmerican singer Sky Ferreira. Strings dominate the sound, creating a sense of friction with the synths and drum machines. They frequently sound jagged and disruptive – Dying for You marries the dynamics of a rave breakdown to occasionally atonal strings; even the Europoppy melody of My Reminder is suddenly dislocated by a discordant flurry. When they aren’t, as on the staccato Seeing Things, it doesn’t feel too much of a stretch to suggest they carry a hint of Cale’s icy baroque pop masterpiece Paris 1919 about them. Elsewhere, on closer Funny Mouth, the kind of industrial metal drums found on House make a reappearance.Atonal, disruptive, industrial: despite all this,Wuthering Heightsisn’t an album likely to alienate Charli’s existing fanbase, who in fairness have already reacted to House’s aural challenges by streaming it 10m times and meme-ing the living daylights out of its horror movie-worthy chorus. The songwriting is uniformly fantastic – she clearly doesn’t view pushing at the boundaries of what she does as any reason to abandon her pop smarts – and furthermore, it works as an album completely independent from the film it’s intended to accompany.Wuthering Heights review – too hot, too greedy adaptation guarantees bad dreams in the nightRead moreThere’s a narrative arc to the songs that doesn’t require a working knowledge of the Wuthering Heights plot: you could simply read them as documenting the rise, fall and emotional fallout from a faintly toxic-sounding, BDSM-y relationship – “push my face into the stone … put the rope between my teeth … please rub the salt in my wounds,” she sings on Out of Myself – that might just as easily be taking place in present-day Basingstoke as on the windswept hills of 19th-century West Riding.One thing Wuthering Heights really has in common with Brat is a sense of bold self-assurance. You could, if you wished, describe its contents as experimental (they certainly are by today’s pop standards, which don’t tend to go so big on disruptive atonality or monologues by octogenarian art-rock legends) but there’s nothing tentative about them. Moreoever, its confidence never feels misplaced. “My name’s on the cover, but is it aCharli xcxalbum?” wrote its author in a lengthy Substack post. “I don’t know, nor do I care to find out.” It definitely is: Wuthering Heights feels substantially more than a side-hustle, or a footnote.Explore more on these topicsCharli xcxWuthering HeightsJohn CalePop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

So many tourists he picks up want to talk about the hit comedy and, as a fan himself, he’s happy to oblige.We’re stuck in traffic, which is odd for this small city on a wet Tuesday morning. “It’s because all the media are here,” he jokes. But there is some truth to it. I’m visiting for the world premiere of How to Get to Heaven fromBelfast, the new series from Derry Girls mastermind Lisa McGee, and to see how the capital became home to the best TV.It’s a big week: as well as McGee’s event, Michael Flatley isin courtsecuring an injunction to ensure the Lord of the Dance 30th anniversary show goes ahead. There’s also a huge buzz around another award-winning locally made show. “Blue Lights has just started filming down the road!” says Melanie Harrison, owner of the Harrison hotel where I’m staying and, like most people I meet on this trip, a true raconteur. Michael Smiley, who stars in the beloved cop drama, regularly stays at the hotel, but he’s now shooting a film with Brad Pitt in Ireland. “If Brad needs accommodation for the night, I’d be happy to have him,” she laughs. He’d be in great company – Zadie Smith recently stayed, as did Siobhán McSweeneyand Bronagh Gallagher. Adrian Dunbar was also heard crooning in the bar during the wee hours.View image in fullscreenJamie Dornan and Brian Milligan in The Fall.Photograph: Everett Collection/AlamyHarrison knows everything about the area’s arts scene; she puts on live operas, poetry readings and art exhibitions in the hotel’s rooms, which are themed on icons linked to the city, from CS Lewis to Angela Lansbury (“Her mum lived around the corner!”). She has seen the rise of homegrown telly first-hand, with local lad Jamie Dornan having filmed The Fall near her doorstep over a decade ago – and she has even become a part of it. Oscar-winner Christoph Waltz shot the opening scene for his film Old Guy in one of her hotel’s rooms, and a dead body was found in one of the suite’s roll-top baths in Channel 5’s drama Murder Most Puzzling.Blue Lightseven asked to film a club scene in the back bar, but guests were booked in. “People would have laughed at the idea of TV jobs in Belfast a few years ago,” says Harrison.That’s not the case now. McGee’s Bafta-winning sitcom put Derry on the global culture map, but parts were filmed in Belfast and its surrounding areas, helping the capital to become the heart of Northern Ireland’s TV renaissance. In the past few years it has boasted: Channel 4’s love-across-the-Troubles dramaTrespasses; Sky’s spiky romcomThe Lovers; the BBC’s adaptation of Sally Rooney’sConversations with Friends; ITV’s medical thrillerMalpractice; and HBO’s epic Game of Thrones prequelA Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. Line of Duty will also be produced here again when it returns after a hiatus.

A stop at the Seamus Heaney Centre proves the calibre of the city’s domestic TV storytellers: McGee, the Blue Lights creators Declan Lawn and Adam Patterson, and Trespasses writer Louise Kennedy have all been fellows. Catherine Grimes, a music supervisor who has worked with all three names, joins the tour. She left rural Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles in the 1980s and worked on shows such as Absolutely Fabulous and The Royle Family in London. After lockdown, Grimes was offered Blue Lights and she moved to Belfast. She is now responsible for the needle-drops in How to Get to Heaven from Belfast, calling McGee an “all-round gorgeous person” who is also a “very enthusiastic and knowledgable music fan”. The work just keeps coming.“I’d always been connected to the storytelling in the songs and literature of Northern Ireland,” she later tells me. “But to now be immersed on a daily basis in a reinvigorated, vibrant, exciting community which has universal stories to tell, influenced by its unique history, is a really full circle moment. I have a laugh literally every day. Northern Irish people have a quick wit and humour that can’t be beaten, despite our devastating past.”‘Wouldn’t it be lovely if I could shut up?’ Meet Lola Petticrew, TV’s most fearless actorRead moreThis boom in TV has been a long time coming.During the Troubles, many of the screen stories that focused on the conflict were regulated and censored. Take Play for Today: Carson Country in 1972, which was made in London and explored the roots of the Troubles. “Its transmission was delayed for several months on the grounds that it would be perceived as politically biased and might enflame the situation in Northern Ireland,” reportedmedia expert Prof John Hillin 2020. For another play in the same series two years later, titled The Dandelion Clock, reluctant staff and security risks meant production was pushed back to London. Yet as the landscape slowly developed, TV plays made in Belfast would help to show working-class life there: in the 80s, Graham Reid’s “Billy trilogy”, which launched the career of a young Kenneth Branagh, was watched by millions across the UK.Around the time of the 1998 Good Friday agreement, government-backed agencyNorthern Ireland Screenwas set up to attract international film and TV producers. More nuanced tellings of Northern Ireland started to emerge, along with that cracking humour – but sitcoms such as the satirical Give My Head Peace, which has been running for more than 30 years, never took off outside the country. “People weren’t interested,” recalls Grimes. “And people didn’t really understand the language.” Derry Girls, she says, was massive for changing that – even if some fans still need to watch it with subtitles on.It wasGame of Thronesthat took Belfast to new TV heights. From 2010, the Emmy-winning fantasy was largely filmed at the newly renovated shipyard Titanic Studios and nearby Linen Mill Studios in Banbridge, with proximity to the coast and countryside making it cheap and easy to film Westeros’s varied landscapes on location. As I stop at the city’s pubs on a food tour, my guide, Barry, says the Harp and the Duke of York were once packed with stars like Kit Harington and Emilia Clarke. But, he says, they were treated no differently to the next person enjoying a Guinness or a Harp: “Belfast people don’t let people get above their station, no matter who they are.”View image in fullscreenLisa McGee at the premiere of How to Get to Heaven from Belfast.Photograph: StillMoving.Net/ShutterstockNight falls and the city’s independent cinema, Queen’s Film theatre, opens its doors for the screening of How to Get to Heaven from Belfast. McGee arrives dressed in a tartan power suit and, with James Nesbitt in the audience, introduces the first episode. It is decidedly different to Derry Girls: a “mystery and comedy with horror elements” about three women in their late 30s – Dara, Saoirse, Robyn – who go on a road trip to find their dead friend. True to its title, the show is filmed and set in and around Belfast, with the area’s history naturally baked in.McGee, now a Belfast resident via Derry and London, has loved showing her city to Netflix’s international audience, and local residents will recognise sights such as the yellow Harland and Wolff cranes, Lyric theatre, Grand Central hotel and Limelight nightclub. “I went to uni at Queen’s so I’ve done a few 70s nights at the Limelight,” she says with a smile. “But everywhere has their own [version of] Limelight, you know what I mean? Those specifics are what makes the story universal.”For Belfast-born Roisin Gallagher, who stars as Saoirse, it was the dialogue and fast-talking that made How to Get to Heaven from Belfast feel true to life: “I knew it. I understood it. To read something that you identify with because it’s in your DNA, it’s in your bones. There’s such an integrity in being allowed to speak as fast as Saoirse would speak. Not to streamline it for a wider audience, but just be really true to the nature of the place that you’re from.”View image in fullscreenCaoilfhionn Dunne (Dara), Roisin Gallagher (Saoirse) and Sinéad Keenan (Robyn) in How to Get to Heaven from Belfast.Photograph: NetflixA 40-minute drive out of Belfast the next morning, I check into the Harbourview hotel in Carnlough, on the wet and wild Antrim coast. This whiskey hotel, renamed the Knockdara in the script, is the starting point of the show’s road trip, where the friends stay before the funeral (weirdly, there is a wake happening when I arrive). The hotel has since had a revamp, but I immediately recognise the reception desk that Ardal O’Hanlon’s hotel manager pops up at, with a flashing dicky-bow. The hotel’s co-owner, Adrian McLaughlin, is embracing the Netflix effect: “We’re going to have a screening party and watch it on the big screen!” There’s already a themed cocktail menu with one called the Wake, laced with Irish whiskey.It isn’t the first time a TV show has brought visitors to this quaint harbour. Two minutes from the hotel are the steps emerging from the sea which Arya climbed up after being stabbed by the Waif in Game of Thrones. A jeweller who provided items for the show is based just down the road, a couple tells us over dinner later, the woman flashing her ring. Screen tourism has boosted Northern Ireland’s economy significantly: Blue Lights and Hope Street created more than 280 jobs, with theBBC investing£112m in the country in 2023/34; Game of Thronesinjected£251m into the area. Endless studio and bus tours followed, and fans love embarking on their own location adventures.View image in fullscreenA Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.Photograph: HBOGlenarm Castle estate, a short drive away from the Harbourview, should probably ready itself for some screen tourism, too. As George the butler hosts a tour of the residence, I ask whether A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms – which has a second series planned for 2027 – was filmed here. He points out of the window at the open grounds and says a set was erected there for a few months, constantly covered with a mysterious mist: “It looked like a medieval village.” Staff didn’t have a clue what was taking place but they tried to guess the storyline with the sigils they spotted.There’s plenty more top telly cooking in Belfast, from the third season of Jimmy McGovern’s Bafta-winningTimeto psychological thrillerClose to Meand that long-awaited Line of Duty comeback. Bill Murray has also been spotted filming a golf drama, and Blue Lights, now in its fourth season, is surely here to stay – although Grimes is tight-lipped about the return of popular (and last seen dead in season one) copper Gerry.“I do think we are special,” she says of her industry. “We are supportive of each other – we now have the opportunity to shine on screen. People like working here. It’s friendly and the locals are sincere about wanting everyone who visits to have a good experience and a laugh.“We were bereft of visitors for many years, so now we like to show the world all the good bits.”How to Get to Heaven from Belfast is on Netflix nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionDerry GirlsBelfastLine of DutyBlue LightsGame of ThronesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He did not have to spell out who from. His comments came 24 hours after the departure of Starmer’s chief of staff,Morgan McSweeney, a man who has shaped Labour’s modern incarnation.McSweeney’s presence loomed the largest over any other in Starmer’s government, and his departure means there are many cabinet ministers, groups and factions of the party who spy an opportunity to define what comes next.“There is a vacuum in Morgan’s absence,” one seniorLabourfigure said. Referring to the cruel anecdote often used about Starmer – that he is a man who believe he is in control of a driverless train – he said: “Everyone is now vying for the central controls of the DLR, with Keir still in the fake driving seat. We really need the prime minister at some point to work out the controls for himself.”View image in fullscreenAfter McSweeney’s influence, the PM’s most natural loyalists are now on the party’s right.Photograph: Chris J Ratcliffe/ReutersStarmer’s closest friends in politics, including his biographer Tom Baldwin, have often expressed frustration that he has not shown his true beliefs in power.On Tuesday, Miliband said he believed this was a moment when Starmer could decide to be more radical. “I’m one of his closest friends in politics. I have had a frustration, that the private Keir we know hasn’t been sufficiently on display to the public,” he said. He believed Starmer would “seize this moment and make it a moment of change”.Starmer ousts cabinet secretary in clear-out of top team after Mandelson scandalRead moreBut what does that mean? Another senior Labour source said: “When people say: ‘Let Keir be Keir,’ they can often just mean he should do whatever they personally believe in.”There are those who want to see a progressive pivot, for Starmer to more aggressively challenge Reform UK. Many want to see a symbolic gesture to end the McSweeney era of factionalism – a cabinet reshuffle, a change to the whips’ office, the end of parliamentary suspensions. Many believe the party needs to chart a new economic course, especially on the cost of living.“He’s on reprieve until May. I think people looked on Monday and went: ‘I definitely don’t want a leadership contest now,’” one MP said. “But people can’t afford a decent life; it’s the most important issue. If you want to win again, we have to sort that out. The current policy prospectus isn’t going to do it.”The faction that will flex its muscles the most in the coming weeks is the soft left, represented by the Tribune group of Labour MPs, of which Starmer was himself once a member.Tribune’s executive, which includes the former cabinet minister Louise Haigh, will soon begin to put forward its own policy proposals, on the economy, long-term welfare reform and social cohesion.View image in fullscreenLouise Haigh leaving 10 Downing Street after a cabinet meeting in October 2024.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesOne soft-left MP said: “We need a much more coherent economic and political strategy. Yes, the culture needs addressing, but No 10 also needs beefing up. It is horribly underpowered. And we need to turbocharge cleaning up politics – put some white knight in charge of it and let them crack on, not just a review.“I don’t know what Keir’s appetite actually is to change anything radically. It’s not been evident so far. I fear he will just think he’s got through this and now back to business as usual.”A left turn would be fiercely resisted by some in the parliamentary party. Starmer may have started off in Tribune, but under McSweeney’s direction, his most natural loyalists are now on the party’s right – including many ambitious new MPs who want to modernise Labour’s economic offering.Furious female Labour MPs urge Starmer to make a woman his de facto deputyRead moreThey want a focus on housing, growth and opportunities for the young, rather than a return to Labour’s traditional comfort zones of nationalisation and welfare.In the coming weeks, the Labour Growth Group (LGG) will produce a document with the draft title the Beveridge report for the economy, which is already in the hands of Treasury ministers.The group, often painted as loyalists to the Starmer project, will accuse the government of having come into power without a political and economic philosophy. But it will say a relentless focus on wages, opportunity and costs is the way to attract voters back both from Reform and the Greens.The group will argue that Labour’s economic vision has been insufficiently radical and say Britain has become an “extraction economy” that rewards loopholes, skimming and grifting, rather than building and investing.It will name a new list of “five giants” – as William Beveridge did in his 1942 foundation for the welfare state. The new barriers are the immiseration of low wages; the insecurity that comes from crushingly high bills; powerlessness that comes from a loss of faith in democracy; indignity, and the fracture of communities pitted against each other.But the new MP Yuan Yang, who sits both on Tribune’s executive and the LGG, said there was common ground between the two groups.View image in fullscreenYuan Yang, who was elected as the MP for Earley and Woodley in 2024.Photograph: Ben Montgomery/Getty Images“I’m personally very concerned about where productivity growth is really happening in the economy,” she said, adding that there were far too many companies that thrived on rent extraction, rather than innovation or producing valued services.“In my part of Reading, property management agencies are a prime example of this. Residents are trapped and paying hundreds of pounds in monthly fees to them. They get away with it because they effectively have a monopoly over each residential estate,” she said.“There are too many examples of this kind of anticompetitive behaviour. I want economic regulation, including a tax system, that disincentivises corporate grift and rewards hard graft. We need to make clear whose side we’re on.”One minister called the report the most serious answer they had seen to the question of what Labour should be for. “Reform, the Greens and the nationalists are all eating into our vote because they can name something people feel in their daily lives – the system is broken – and point to who broke it. Their answers are garbage but at least they have a diagnosis. Right now we don’t even have that,” the minister said.“The question the whole party is struggling with is how to respond when you’re losing voters to Reform and the Greens on both flanks. You can’t rebuild the coalition by just tacking one way and giving up the other, you need to be able to speak to both.”For many new MPs there is intense frustration at the pace of change and the infighting and scandal that have dominated the last 18 months. More groups across the parliamentary Labour party are multiplying to generate new ideas to offer up.Five MPs – Jeevun Sandher, Liam Byrne, Anna Gelderd, Andrew Lewin and Luke Murphy – have set up a space called Labour Thinks to bring in guest speakers on how to govern well and win back disillusioned voters.View image in fullscreenJeevun Sandher speaking in the Commons.Photograph: House of CommonsAmong almost all of Starmer’s critics, there is a desire to see a big change in the way No 10 operates and communicates. At present, Starmer has no chief of staff, communications chief or cabinet secretary, with the roles split across a number of acting placeholders.“The most important thing Keir can do now is build the right team,” one minister said. “He must have the right chief of staff, the right lines of accountability, a person who can command trust and make fast decisions. I don’t know who that person is.‘Jellyfish’ and ‘doormat’: why is Keir Starmer so deeply unpopular?Read more“I do not think it works as a shared position. Someone has to make the final call, quickly, and that cannot always be the prime minister himself, but someone who absolutely knows his mind and instincts.”Cabinet ministers also wanted to see a marked change in approach. “You make bad decisions and bad judgments when you have an ever increasingly smaller worldview. That’s what leads to missteps and mistakes, because you’re not hearing alternatives,” one said. “We just need to give a much clearer articulation of ourselves and whose side we’re on and what we’re doing, who we’re doing it for.”Another cabinet minister said: “I think Keir often gives the impression he thinks it is unfair that we are not being sufficiently credited for what we are doing. Instead of believing it is unfair, we need to ruthlessly interrogate why that is.”MPs and ministers are divided about whether a post-factional reshuffle would help Starmer, though the Tribune group made an explicit call when it gave its qualified backing to Starmer on Monday.Many say the whips’ office is in need of total reform, with too many of the whips distrusted by MPs because they have personal relationships with ministers or advisers in No 10.Who could fill key No 10 vacancies – and win the battle for Starmer’s ear?Read more“In an ideal world we would do a reshuffle. We clearly need a broader coalition of voices at the top; we clearly need to bring in new talent,” one senior party figure said. “But at the same time, I don’t know if you can do an effective reshuffle at this point, when you are weak like this. It has to come from a position of strength. We are only a few months since the last disastrous one. I think Keir would have to tread very carefully with that.”Almost every MP and cabinet minister said Starmer’s reprieve was temporary. Another scandal, the loss of the Gorton and Denton byelection, or catastrophe in the May elections could seal the prime minister’s fate.View image in fullscreenPosters for the Green party candidate Hannah Spencer among flyers on a noticeboard in Gorton.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesBut almost all said they thought the fundamental work of what needed to change to revive Labour’s fortunes had not been done by its potential new leaders. “I could not tell you a single thing about what the difference is between Wes [Streeting] and Angela [Rayner] and what they would change about the country – apart from vibes,” one Labour MP said.For some new MPs, there is a sense of despair about how shallow the thinking is among those eager to change leader, reflected in the obvious leadership candidates’ lack of depth.“One thing that has fucked our politics since 2016 is the delusion of people who think they can do the job for reasons that are ultimately facile and nothing to do with the massive challenges our country faces,” one said.“Until people get serious about that being the test of who should be PM, our politics will keep convulsing and cycling through PMs at pace.”Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerEconomic policyMorgan McSweeneynewsShareReuse this content"

With so many brands and models to choose from, it can be bewildering. Sticking with established brands isn’t necessarily a safe bet, with past performance being no guarantee that the latest models will be as good.

The ideal thing to do would be to take a few models home to try them out – but good luck persuading anyone to let you do that. Thankfully, you won’t have to try because I’ve tested an array of models for you. I’ve measured each one’s ability to perform a range of real-world cleaning jobs, so you can discover the best vacuum cleaner for you.At a glanceBest corded vacuum cleaner overall:Shark Detect XL Car + Pet LA791UKT£299 at AmazonBest cordless vacuum cleaner overall:Shark PowerDetect Clean & Empty IP3251UKT£347.64 at John LewisBest budget corded vacuum cleaner:Numatic Henry Home£189.99 at HenryBest cordless vacuum cleaner for pet hair:Vax HomePro Pet-Design£319 at VeryBest vacuum for deep cleaning:Dyson Gen5detect£749 at AmazonWhy you should trust meThis isn’t the first time I’ve tested vacuum cleaners – over the past few years, I’ve reviewed them for various publications, which has given me a solid understanding of what makes a model good or bad. I’ve kept hold of a few of my favourite models for long-term testing, so I can easily make direct comparisons against those that are new on the block.My house is also perfectly set up for vacuuming challenges. It has a mix of carpet and hard floor, a ready supply of hair (pet from my own dog and a box of clippings I procured from a local groomer; human from the hairbrush and carpet surrounding the dressing tables of long-haired family members), and plenty of dusty flour and chunky cat litter for testing purposes.How I testedView image in fullscreenEach vacuum cleaner was tasked with clearing up flour, cat litter and pet hair.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianBefore I started any cleaning, I used a suction meter to test the suction power of every vacuum, usually by sealing it with tape over the closest suitable opening to the collection bin. I also tested the batteries of cordless vacuums, where I timed how long it took for the battery to run down on the most and least powerful settings.Then it was on to the nitty-gritty. I carefully weighed out quantities of flour, cat litter and pet hair, depositing it on carpet and hard floor to test each vacuum. I weighed each model’s collection bin before I started, then passed the vacuum over each type of mess using the standard floor head or most appropriate alternative. Each vacuum was passed over the spillage once, using a single forward and pull-back motion. Then, by weighing the collection bin again, I was able to establish how much of the dirt had been picked up.After the test, models were either returned to the appropriate manufacturers, or – in the instance they didn’t want them back – donated to theBritish Heart Foundation.The best vacuum cleaners in 2026View image in fullscreenBunch of suckers: the vacuum cleaners we put to the test.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianBest corded vacuum cleaner overall:Shark Detect XL Car + Pet LA791UKTSharkDetect XL Car + Pet LA791UKTfrom£299£349.99 at Shark£299 at AmazonWhat we lovePowerful, great performance, versatileWhat we don’t lovePricey if you won’t use all its featuresPhotograph: Andy Shaw/The Guardian£349.99 at Shark£299 at AmazonIf you want a vacuum that won’t run out of juice mid-clean, then the Shark LA791UKT is the best corded upright I’ve tested. It’s a modern-looking device with a sophisticated dual-roller floor head, a decent bin capacity of 2.5l, and no unnecessary features.Why we love itWhen it came to cleaning tests, this Shark literally cleaned up. Flour and pet hair disappeared into its collection bin, with no trace left behind. Admittedly, it didn’t pick up all the cat litter we put down on a single backward and forward pass, but unleashing the handle from the main unit lets you easily target larger chunks – and it finished the clean-up perfectly.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt comes with a useful selection of accessories for tackling upholstery and getting into nooks and crannies. Conveniently, you can lift the collection bin away from the floor head to help gain access to harder-to-reach areas, too.It’s a shame that …it’s expensive for a corded vacuum – the Henry Home is significantly cheaper.Type:corded uprightIncluded attachments:anti hair wrap pet tool, combination duster, crevice toolWeight (measured):5.2kgSuction power (measured):17kPaNoise:80dBSize:31 x 43 x 116cm (WDH)Dust capacity:2.5lCord length:8mSharkDetect XL Car + Pet LA791UKTfrom£299£349.99 at Shark£299 at AmazonWhat we lovePowerful, great performance, versatileWhat we don’t lovePricey if you won’t use all its featuresBest cordless vacuum cleaner overall:Shark PowerDetect Clean & Empty IP3251UKTSharkPowerDetect Clean & Empty IP3251UKTfrom£347.64£347.64 at John Lewis£348 at SharkWhat we loveExcellent performance and less manual emptyingWhat we don’t loveTakes up more storage space than a regular cordless stickPhotograph: Andy Shaw/The Guardian£347.64 at John Lewis£348 at SharkCordless vacuum cleaners are great for quick and efficient cleanups. However, they can be a pain to empty because of the dust cloud that billows out of bagless models and the relatively small size of their collection bins, which means more frequent emptying. The IP3251UKT takes some of this pain away by emptying itself into a larger, secondary collection bin on the stand.Why we love itThe IP3251UKT wins points for being exceptionally good at its job. During tests, its dual-roller floor head performed as well as that on the corded LA791UKT, reviewed above, but it fared better when picking up the larger cat litter particles, leaving nothing behind.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianThe self-emptying uses a bagless system that you just remove and tip into the bin, so there are no consumables to worry about. In addition, the base station also charges the device, so you can just slot the vacuum into its dock and forget about it. It isn’t as neat a solution as a wall mount, and it takes up more space, but the cleaner is always empty of dust and fully charged when you next need it.It’s a shame that …the capacity of the secondary collection bin in the base is only 2l, so it only takes three complete fills of the vacuum’s 0.7l bin before that needs emptying, too.Type:self-emptying cordless stickIncluded attachments:combination duster crevice tool, multi-surface tool, motorised hand toolWeight (measured):3.71kgSuction power (measured):28kPaNoise:86dBSize:26 x 47 x 118cm (WDH, including dock)Dust capacity:0.7l (vacuum), 2l (dock)Battery life (measured):43minsSharkPowerDetect Clean & Empty IP3251UKTfrom£347.64£347.64 at John Lewis£348 at SharkWhat we loveExcellent performance and less manual emptyingWhat we don’t loveTakes up more storage space than a regular cordless stickBest budget corded vacuum cleaner:Numatic Henry HomeHenryHome£189.99£189.99 at HenryWhat we loveMore cleaning attachments than the basic Henry modelWhat we don’t loveFloor heads don’t have all the features of sophisticated rivals£189.99 at HenryThe Henry’s design has stood the test of time, finding favour with home users and professional cleaners since its introduction in the early 1980s. Not much has changed on the basic model, but I tested the Henry Home, exclusive to the Henry website, which comes with more floor accessories than are usually offered by other retailers.Why we love itAt the time of writing, the £189.99 Henry Home was only about £20 more than the standard Henry, available from the likes ofCurrysandArgos. That’s a good deal considering the extra equipment. For my carpet tests, I tried the AiroBrush, which is a brush roller that uses an internal air turbine to convert its own suction into the mechanical power needed to rotate the roller. It didn’t actually cope with pet hair or cat litter that well, becoming clogged by the former. Switching over to a simple funnel gathered the remainder. However, for vacuuming lighter everyday dirt on carpeted areas, the AiroBrush coped just fine.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianThe hard floor tool (basically a wide funnel with a stiff brush) did a cracking job on my hard floors, although I did find that it’s best held at an angle to ease the passage of larger particles and hair clumps.It’s a shame that …the AiroBrush doesn’t have an anti-tangle mechanism; hair quickly became wrapped around its roller.Type:corded barrelIncluded attachments:crevice tool, dusting tool, upholstery/mattress tool, AiroBrush, hard floor tool, multi-angle tool, flexi crevice toolWeight (measured):7.1kgSuction power (measured):18.5kPaNoise:72dBSize:32 x 34 x 35cm (WDH, cylinder unit only)Dust capacity:6lCord length:10mHenryHome£189.99£189.99 at HenryWhat we loveMore cleaning attachments than the basic Henry modelWhat we don’t loveFloor heads don’t have all the features of sophisticated rivalsBest cordless vacuum cleaner for pet hair:Vax HomePro Pet-DesignVaxHomePro Pet-Designfrom£319£319 at Very£319.99 at VaxWhat we loveGreat value for a feature-packed cordless stickWhat we don’t loveBetter on carpet than hard floor£319 at Very£319.99 at VaxCordless stick vacuums can be expensive, but they don’t have to be.

Although launched at an eye-watering £850, the current price of this brilliant vacuum is down to a slightly lower £749.Why we love itUnlike the V16, the Gen5 comes with two floor heads: the Digital Motorbar for carpet, and the Fluffy Optic for hard floor. Although you have to swap them over when you transition between surfaces, the benefit is that each one is an expert at its job. There’s also a handy dusting brush and crevice tool – built into the extension wand, so it’s always available – and what’s arguably the best motorised upholstery tool in the business.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIn tests, this vacuum performs so well that I tend to use it to tidy up after testing, if other vacuums have fallen short.It’s a shame that …swapping floor heads is an annoyance that Shark users don’t have to experience.Type:cordless stickIncluded attachments:built-in dusting and crevice tool, combination tool, hair screw toolWeight (measured):3.5kgSuction power (measured):31kPaNoise:70dBSize:25 x 28 x 128cm (WDH)Dust capacity:0.77lBattery life (measured):56minsDysonGen5detect£749£749 at AmazonWhat we loveTwo floor heads make it expert on carpet and hard floorWhat we don’t loveSwitching between floor heads mid-clean is a faffThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘Dirt leapt up the handheld funnel attachments’: the Numatic Henry Quick Pro.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianMiele Guard L1 Comfort XLMieleGuard L1 Comfort XLfrom£499£499 at Miele£499 at John LewisWhat we loveA luxurious cylinder vacuum cleaner designed for ease of useWhat we don’t loveMore expensive than similar rivalsPhotograph: Andy Shaw/The Guardian£499 at Miele£499 at John LewisBest for:corded convenienceWhile the Henry Home offers an affordable corded cylinder experience, the Miele Guard L1 is a more luxurious rival.

As with the Shark, the base station also serves as a charging dock, although this model uses bags to gather the dirt.

Cordless sticks are the fashionable choice, with improvements in battery power and cleaning ability over the past decade bringing them in line with the performance of corded models.However, there are a few things to consider. While the batteries should last for about 40 minutes or more on their most economical setting, you won’t get anything like that if you need to run them at full power. If you have a larger home or persistent dirt problems (such as a pet that sheds a lot of hair), then a cordless might run out of power before you’ve finished cleaning. In these situations, a corded model makes more sense. As a side benefit, corded cleaners tend to have a larger capacity, so don’t need emptying as often.The downsides of a corded vacuum mostly concern the inconvenience of the cord. For example, you’ll need to keep switching plug sockets as you move around the house, as even the longest cables only reach around 10m. The cord will inevitably also get in the way as you clean. I tend to work with the cord slung over my shoulder as I vacuum, working away from the plug socket the machine is connected to, but this is all additional fuss that you don’t get from a cordless model.What should you look for in a vacuum cleaner?Whichever type of cleaner you choose, make sure that it has the right attachments. All vacuum cleaners should come with a floor head unless they’re specifically configured as handhelds, although the type you’ll need depends on whether you have mostly carpet or hard floor. Floor heads with brush rollers tend to work well at teasing dirt out of carpet, while fluffy rollers are excellent on hard floor. Suction-only floor heads can work well, but might not tease as much dirt out of thicker-pile carpets.If your floor seems to attract hair, then look for anti-tangle devices. When these work well they can dramatically reduce the amount of hair that becomes tangled around a floor head’s roller, which in my opinion is one of the least pleasant vacuum maintenance jobs that you’ll need to perform.Other attachments worth looking out for are the handheld options. I like to have a crevice tool, a soft dusting brush and an upholstery tool, with the latter preferably being motorised. Any further additions are a bonus.When it comes to emptying, bagless vacuums can get messy. If you’re looking for features such as Hepa filters to rid allergy-inducing particles, it’s also worth checking how they empty, as dust can just escape again unless you empty them outside. Vacuums with bags make emptying cleaner, but there’s an ongoing cost to replace them and it’s more rubbish headed for landfill.For more:The best cordless vacuum cleaners for a spotless homeThe best robot vacuums to keep your home clean and dust freeThe best steam cleaners and mops, testedHow to make your vacuum cleaner last longerAndy Shaw is aconsumer journalist and technology addict.

She said: “We were banned because Palestine Action’s disruption of Israel’s largest weapons manufacturer, Elbit Systems, cost the corporation millions of pounds in profits and to lose out on multibillion-pound contracts.“We’ve used the same tactics as direct action organisations throughout history, including anti-war groups Keir Starmer defended in court, and the government acknowledged in these legal proceedings that this ban was based on property damage, not violence against people.“Banning Palestine Action was always about appeasing pro-Israel lobby groups and weapons manufacturers, and nothing to do with terrorism … Today’s landmark ruling is a victory for freedom for all, and I urge the government to respect the court’s decision and bring this injustice to an end without further delay.”The judgment is the first time that an organisation banned under anti-terrorism law has successfully challenged proscription in court.The judges allowed the challenge on two of four grounds. They were that there was “a very significant interference” with the rights to freedom of speech and freedom of assembly and that Cooper’s decision to proscribe Palestine Action was not consistent with her own policy, which required her to take into account factors including the nature and scale of the organisation’s activities, and the specific threat that it posed to the UK.Sharp described Palestine Action as an organisation “that promotes its political cause through criminality and encouragement of criminality”, but added: “The court considered that the proscription of Palestine Action was disproportionate. A very small number of Palestine Action’s activities amounted to acts of terrorism within the definition of section 1 of the 2000 [Terrorism] Act.“For these, and for Palestine Action’s other criminal activities, the general criminal law remains available. The nature and scale of Palestine Action’s activities falling within the definition of terrorism had not yet reached the level, scale and persistence to warrant proscription.”About 100 people ​who had gathered outside the ​high ​court building in central London cheered and chanted “free Palestine” when they heard the decision.View image in fullscreenProtesters outside the Royal Courts of Justice following the verdict.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAThe UN special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, Ben Saul, Amnesty International UK and Liberty, who all intervened in the case, called for Mahmood to respect the court’s decision.Saul said accepting the judgment “will enable the relevant authorities to take no further action against those who legitimately expressed their beliefs about Israel and Palestine since 5 July 2025 and were caught up in the policing of the unlawful ban; and also, to apologise to those affected for stigmatising them as terrorists”.The Green party leader, Zack Polanski, said: “It is time for the government to stop criminalising the people protesting a genocide.”The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson, Max Wilkinson, said: “Placing Palestine Action in the same legal category as Isis was disproportionate.”However, the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, supported the government’s decision to appeal because “there can be no hesitation when public safety and national security are at stake”.The Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council also threw their support behind an appeal, saying they were “deeply concerned” by the ruling. “Palestine Action has repeatedly targeted buildings hosting Jewish communal institutions, Jewish-owned businesses, or sites associated with Israel, in ways that cause fear and disruption far beyond the immediate protest sites,” the groups said.Palestine Action has always maintained that it targeted companies complicit with Elbit Systems, or otherwise with the oppression of Palestinians, regardless of the owners’ identity.Those arrested since proscription – most of them for holding placards saying “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action” – are accused of offences under section 13 of the Terrorism Act, which carries a maximum sentence of six months in prison. More than 500 of those arrested, who include vicars, pensioners and military veterans, have been charged.Showing support for or being a member of a proscribed group is a crime, with offences under section 12 of the act carrying a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.Mahmood said on Friday: “I amdisappointed by the court’s decision and disagree with the notion that banning this terrorist organisation is disproportionate. The proscription of Palestine Action followed a rigorous and evidence-based decision-making process, endorsed by parliament. The proscription does not prevent peaceful protest in support of the Palestinian cause, another point on which the court agrees.“As a former lord chancellor, I have the deepest respect for our judiciary. Home secretaries must, however, retain the ability to take action to protect our national security and keep the public safe. I intend to fight this judgment in the court of appeal.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Many women in Britain are having children much too late in life and they would prefer to have children much earlier on.”The comments, first reportedby the Independent, have sparked a furious backlash, with one MP describing it as an “alt right fantasy” and an equality campaigner calling it “truly troubling”. The revelations come days after the paper revealed Goodwin previously suggested people whodon’t have children should be taxed extraas punishment.Sarah Owen, the chair of the Commons women and equalities committee, said the comments were “deeply offensive” and appeared to blame women for thedeclining birthrate.“For anyone with fertility issues, like me who struggled with miscarriage after miscarriage, to say [to them] we should be paying more tax for not having children or that it is our fault is deeply offensive, as it is for LGBT+ people or women who can’t afford to have kids,” she said. “It’s clear he didn’t run this grotesque idea past any women in real life.”Natalie Fleet, the Labour MP for Bolsover, who wasgroomed and became pregnant as a 15-year-old, said her pregnancy had happened at a “biologically great age” and she had experienced a “physically perfect pregnancy and easy birth”. But, she added, she had been through “hell on earth”.View image in fullscreenNatalie Fleet MP, seen here at her office last year, was critical of Matt Goodwin’s comments.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianAddressing the former academic on social media, she wrote: “Is this the kind of thing you’ll be wanting to see in our Handmaid’s Tale future?” A reference to theMargaret Atwood novel set in a dystopian future.In a separate podcast with the rightwing author and commentatorJordan Peterson, Goodwin also appeared to agree with the host’s claim that universities have become hotbeds of “politically correct authoritarianism” because they are full of “childless women”.In a February 2025 clip, Peterson said there were three predictors of “politically correct authoritarianism”, of which the first was “being female”, at which point Goodwin interjected and added: “I was going to say that.”Peterson added that an “ethos of harm avoidance” had proliferated because universities “became dominated by not only women – this is even worse, I might as well go in all the way – childless women”.Goodwin responded: “Yeah, actually there are a couple of papers on that Jordan, I’m sure you’ve seen, I think Cory Clark. I’ve read a couple I think showing basically the feminisation of higher education over the last 50 years.”View image in fullscreenMatt Goodwin and Nigel Farage attend an election campaign event in Manchester earlier this month.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAA Reform spokesperson said the two men “were discussing peer-reviewed academic studies showing clear psychological differences between men and women, which influence their views of cancel culture”.Responding to queries about Goodwin suggesting in 2023 that the government “remove personal income tax for women who have two or more children”, the party said Goodwin had not called for childless women to be taxed more but it was time for a “grown-up, mature debate about how we can encourage people to have more children and support British families”.Labour and Reform candidates clash over women feeling threatened by far-right rhetoricRead moreHannah Spencer, the Green party candidate in Gorton and Denton, said women were struggling with the cost of living, caring responsibilities and health inequalities in NHS services. “I wish the Reform candidate put more time into addressing problems and less into looking for divisive, easy answers,” she said.Penny East, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said the “idea that we should be telling young girls they have a moral obligation to have children earlier is both dystopian and deeply sexist […] Suggesting early motherhood is a civic duty is truly troubling.”Writing on social media, the Walthamstow MP,Stella Creasy, said: “I long for the days when a midlife crisis for men like this meant getting a motorbike and a leather jacket, not trying to [get] elected so they could indulge their alt right fantasies about ensuring women were pregnant as soon as they were fertile and then didn’t go to university.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKManchesterStella CreasyGreater ManchesterByelectionsFar rightLocal politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

At nine o’clock on Friday night Matt Weston, the man his teammates call “Captain 110%”, became the first British man ever to win the gold in the men’s skeleton, after four faultless races across the two days of competition.The 28-year-old broke the track record at the Cortina Sliding Centre four times in succession, and won in a combined time of 3min 43.33sec, which was almost a full second ahead of the runner-up, Germany’s Axel Jungk. “I’ve been fortunate enough to win world championships, and European championships and other things, and this blows them all out the water,” Weston said. “I almost feel numb. I keep touching this medal to make sure it is real.”Winter Olympics 2026: Weston chases skeleton gold for GB, Heraskevych’s appeal rejected by Cas – liveRead moreHe is getting married in July, “but for the next few months at least I can say yes, this is the happiest day of my life, then I will have to change my answer”.Weston’s medal means Great Britain is now the most successful Olympic nation in this curious sport, which was invented by Englishmen looking for something new to do on their holidays in St Moritz in the 1920s. The country has now won four gold, one silver and five bronze medals altogether. Eight of those have come this century, after the UK started pumping in money in the early 2000s, when they built the beginnings of a practice track at the University of Bath.Weston, and his teammate Marcus Wyatt, who finished ninth, have had the benefit of the best coaching and technical support in the sport. It shows, even if it’s hard to see on TV. “If it looks like I am lying there doing nothing it means I am doing everything right,” Weston said before coming out to these Olympics. During them, the clock told you everything you needed to know.View image in fullscreenMatt Weston’s mum, Alison, his fiancee, Alex, and his dad, Tom, watch at the skeleton track in Cortina d’Ampezzo.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianHis body may be moving at 80mph, but his mind’s working in slow motion as he shifts his weight to make the minuscule adjustments he needs to stay on the right line around every bend. He is moving so fast that a lot of this is done subconsciously. He has a map of the track in his mind, but he relies on his proprioception, the body’s innate ability to sense its own position and movement, to feel his way down around it.Weston, Britain’s first male individual gold medallist in the Winter Games since Robin Cousins in 1980, says it is a skill he first learned competing in martial arts. When he was a kid, Weston was ranked second in the world in taekwondo. He won a silver at the Under-17 World Cup in 2012. If you’d asked him then, he would have told you he saw himself competing in taekwondo at the Grand Palais during the Summer Olympics in Paris two years ago. But he had to give up the sport when he fractured his back in a training accident. He played county level rugby for a few years on the wing, too. He is, you guess, one of those people who was always going to be an athlete of one sort or another.But it was only when he discovered skeleton racing through a talent ID programme that he found his calling. “I distinctly remember the first time I tried it,” Weston said, “and for the first 10 metres I was thinking, ‘I’ve got no brakes so I’m going to the bottom whether I like it or not’. It was terrifying but as soon as I finished I wanted to go back and do it over again. I had the bug.”View image in fullscreenMarcus Wyatt of Britain finished in ninth after his four runs.Photograph: Annegret Hilse/ReutersWeston has spent a decade chasing after the perfect race. “It’s so hard to describe,” he said, “we work on such fine margins that it is so hard to be perfect, it’s like floating, it’s so smooth it’s almost calming, everything fits, everything clicks, like doing a jigsaw puzzle and picking up the right piece every single time.” It’s hard to believe he will ever come closer to it than he did here in Cortina. “I’m still hunting,” he says, “but at the moment this feels as close as it can get.”Weston will race again in the mixed team event on Sunday, in which he will be paired with the fastest of the three British athletes competing in the final races of the women’s event on Saturday. That looks likely to be Tabby Stoecker, who was in fifth place after the first two heats of the competition.She had been third after the first run, but made a bad mistake coming into the second half of the course. It left her half a second behind the leader. “I think I just need a good meal, a good sleep, some analysing with my coaches, and then to come back tomorrow,” said Stoecker, “because it’s definitely not over.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsTeam GBnewsShareReuse this content"

Visitors for short stays must apply for an Electronic Travel Authorisation that costs £16.Butdual nationalswill, for the first time, be obliged to show their British passport to travel to the UK or pay what many believe is a punitive price of £589 for a “certificate of entitlement” to attach to their second nationality passport in order to board a flight, ferry or train.One British woman living in Germany for years who has dual nationality said she feared her children were going to be affected by the changes, particularly her son who is due to travel to the UK in four weeks’ time.“I’m really annoyed about being treated asBrexitcollateral once again with this short-notice, shortsighted, arbitrary change of the rules,” she said.While the government introduced the rules last year, she and many others feel they had not been communicated well to those living abroad and that keeping up two passports for a family is an expensive “luxury” that not everyone can afford.One British woman living in Spain for more than 30 years chose to take out Spanish citizenship because of Brexit and up to now was free to go to and from the UK with her Spanish passport.But Spain requires non-nationals naturalising to renounce their previous nationality and presenting her British passport at the airport will legally risk her Spanish nationality.She said she is aware that many will argue she should not have renounced her British passport but that this change of rules will apply to many children of British citizens born in Spain who have never held a British passport but whose records will show as dual nationality at border control.“It seems a strange anomaly that while the UK is willing to recognise dual nationality, it refuses to recognise that a valid EU passport held by a UK citizen can give right of entry to the UK,” said Julie, who asked that her real name not be used.Another dual national born and educated in London told how he had booked a flight for a work trip in the last week and has only just discovered he may be stranded. He is British Italian but has never held his own British passport and has freely travelled around for his job on his Italian passport.He is due to fly to New York on Friday with his Italian passport but returns after 25 February and won’t be able to present immigration with an ETA or a British passport. Asked if he had considered paying £589 for a certificate of entitlement to attach to his Italian passport, he said the weeks-long backlog made it impossible to get hold of before Friday.“I found myself having to travel at short notice and am now facing the idea that I may not be allowed back into the country,” said James, who is travelling to a museum in New York to complete logistics on works of art being lent to a gallery inEurope.300,000 children face 10-year wait for settled status under UK plans, says IPPRRead moreA Home Office spokesperson said: “From 25 February 2026, all dual British citizens will need to present either a valid British passport or certificate of entitlement to avoid delays at the border.”They said this was part of a digitisation programme to enable a “seamless travel experience”, while also giving the government “greater power to stop those who pose a threat from setting foot in the country and gives us a fuller picture of immigration”.The EU citizens’ campaign group The 3 million called for a low-cost, one-off travel authorisation similar to one in Canada in place of the £589 certificate currently available.“The UK already has the technology to do the same, so we urge them to act now to ensure British citizens are not locked out of their own country,” said Monique Hawkins, the head of policy and advocacy at The 3 million.If you areaffected by the change and want to share your story, email lisa.ocarroll@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsHome OfficeImmigration and asylumBrexitEuropean UnionEuropePassport OfficeForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

He used his speech to lambast European leaders for supposedly blocking free speech and being soft on migration, questioning whether such values were compatible with a US guarantee of mutual security.Trump has regularly questioned the value of Nato, including theclaim in Januarythat European nations “stayed a little back, a little off the frontlines” while supporting US troops in Afghanistan, comments that prompted arare direct rebukefrom Starmer.In extracts of the speech released in advance by No 10, Starmer said he was setting out “a vision of European security and greater European autonomy that does not herald US withdrawal, but answers the call for more burden-sharing in full, and remakes the ties that have served us so well”.In another pushback against the politics of Brexit, he condemned UK politicians who would rather avoid ties with Europe, after the Conservatives expressed scepticism about some defence-based links.“We are not the Britain of the Brexit years any more,” the speech says. “Because we know that, in dangerous times, we would not take control by turning inward – we would surrender it. And I won’t let that happen.“There is no British security without Europe, and no European security without Britain. That is the lesson of history – and it is today’s reality too.”Calling for better cooperation on defence procurement, the speech says the UK should help create a new era for the continent.“As I see it – Europe is a sleeping giant. Our economies dwarf Russia’s, 10 times over,” Starmer will say.“We have huge defence capabilities. Yet, too often, all of this has added up to less than the sum of its parts. Across Europe, fragmented industrial planning and long, drawn out procurement mechanisms have led to gaps in some areas – and massive duplication in others.”Ministers must, he said, “level with the public and build consent for the decisions we will have to take to keep us all safe”.The PM will go on: “Because, if we don’t, the peddlers of easy answers on the extreme left and the extreme right are ready. They will offer their solutions instead. It’s striking that the different ends of the spectrum share so much. Soft on Russia and weak on Nato – if not outright opposed.“The future they offer is one of division and then capitulation. The lamps would go out across Europe once again. But we will not let that happen.”Explore more on these topicsNatoKeir StarmerDefence policyEuropeShareReuse this content"

This order, however imperfect it was even at its best, no longer exists in that form.”Switching to English to ram home his message, Merz said: “In the era of great power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone. Dear friends, being a part of Nato is not only Europe’s competitive advantage. It is also the United States’ competitive advantage.”“So let’s repair and revive transatlantic trust together,” he added.The German chancellor’s speech opened the annual gathering of top global security figures including many European leaders and the US secretary of state,Marco Rubio.At last year’s conference, held a few weeks into Trump’s second term, the US vice-president,JD Vance, stunned European leadersby lecturing them about the state of democracy and freedom of speech on the continent – a moment that set the tone for the last year.View image in fullscreenThe US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, met Friedrich Merz at a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the conference.Photograph: Liesa Johannssen/AFP/GettyA series of statements and moves from the Trump administration targeting allies has followed, including Trump’s threat last month to impose new tariffs on several European countries in a move tosecure US control of Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, a Nato ally.Merz drew most applause from an audience brimming with hostility toward US unilateralism when he directly criticised the current American administration, saying: “The culture war of the Maga movement is not ours. Freedom of speech ends here with us when that speech is directed against human dignity and the basic law. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade. We stand by climate agreements and the World Health Organization.”“In the age of great powers, our freedom is no longer a given. It is threatened,” he said, adding that “firmness and willpower will be needed to assert this freedom”. Challenging Trump’s unilateral style, Merz added: “Autocracies may have followers, democracies have partners and allies.”2:06Munich Security Conference 2026: where does the US-EU relationship stand? – videoAt the same time, he said Europe must cast off its excessive dependence on the US, emphasising: “We won’t do that by writing offNato.”He also urged the US president to recognise it was still possible toexhaust Russia economicallyand militarily, to the point where it was willing to come to the negotiating table over Ukraine.With Germany one of the European countries doing the most to boost its own defence spending, Merz clearly felt in a strong enough position to insist the US needed to do more to listen to European concerns about its security and the legitimacy of a sustained European pillar of Nato.Describing the Munich conference as a seismograph for the state of US-European relations, he said the Ukraine war “had forced Europe to return from a vacation from world history. Together we have entered an era that is once again marked by power and big-power politics.”CIA publishes recruitment video aimed at disaffected Chinese soldiersRead moreThese big powers, Merz said, “make their own rules. It is fast, harsh and often unpredictable. These powers exploit natural resources, technologies and supply chains using them as bargaining tools.”Merz was speaking as the fourth anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine approaches and one year after Vance used his speech in the same hall to criticise Europeans for not taking enough control of their own defence arrangements and ignoring the demands of their electorates.Merz responded by saying it was crucial for the continent to change its mindset and fully exploit the “enormous” military, political, economic and technological potential of a “sovereign Europe”. Germany was striving for “partnership-based leadership” in Europe but retained no “hegemonic fantasies”.View image in fullscreenThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, arrives at the conference in Munich.Photograph: Thomas Kienzle/APMerz said he had begun talks with Macron about a European nuclear deterrent. This, he said, must be firmly integrated into Nato’s nuclear arsenal and would not result in some parts of Europe being more defended than others. The chancellor stated that Germany was not abandoning Nato but wanted to establish a “strong, self-sustaining pillar” within the alliance.In his speech Macron insisted Europe must be at the table to negotiate a new arms control settlement with Russia covering ballistic missiles, deep strike capacity, defence technology and nuclear weapons.The French president said previous arms control treaties such as the now defunct INF Treaty were negotiated only by the US and this could not be repeated if Europe was to be taken seriously as a geopolitical power.He said initial talks about new European security architecture had already been held with the UK and Germany, but it was now time to broaden the consultations across Europe.0:53Emmanuel Macron: Time for Europe to become geopolitical power – videoMacron warned a Ukrainian peace settlement required applying extra pressure, but even if an agreement was reached Europe faced the challenge of how to “coexist with an unreconstructed aggressive Russia on our borders” that has “a bloated army and a defence industry on a sugar high”.Calling for a transparent independent European channel of communication with Russia, he said the post second world war security architecture had been “totally designed and framed during the cold war times” and needed a new articulation.Addressing the criticisms directed at Europe last year by Vance, Macron said “Europe has been vilified … as a repressive continent where speech is not free and where alternative facts cannot claim the same right of citizenship as truth itself – that outdated and cumbersome concept.”Explore more on these topicsFriedrich MerzNatoDonald TrumpMarco RubioJD VanceEmmanuel MacronNuclear weaponsnewsShareReuse this content"

Another eight large-scale detention centers would hold 7,000 to 10,000 people at a time and serve as “the primary locations” for deportations. Detainees would spend an average of three to seven days at the processing sites before being transported to the larger facilities, where they would be held about 60 days before being deported.US homeland security department on track for shutdown after funding bill fails in SenateRead moreThe new model for increasing detention space is needed, according to the document, due to asurge in ICE hiresand an anticipated rise in arrests. The number ofpeople in ICE detentionhas hit records in the secondTrump administration.These facilities will “ensure the safe and humane civil detention of aliens in ICE custody, while helping ICE effectuate mass deportations”, the documents said. The effort will rely on the billions of dollars appropriated by Congress in theOne Big Beautiful Bill Actto “fully implement a new detention model by the end of Fiscal Year 2026”, according to the documents.Together, the records provide the clearest view so far of the Trump administration’s strategy to reshape immigrant detention by converting buildings initially built for industrial use – a broad undertaking intended to strengthen ICE’s capacity to apprehend more immigrants and remove them more quickly.Instead of transferring detainees around the country based on open bed space, the redesigned system would channel individuals into a network of large centralized facilities where they would remain until deportation, according to ICE’s planning documents.There appear to beconflictingstatements about when the economic impact analysis for the proposed Merrimack facility was delivered to New Hampshire’s governor, Kelly Ayotte.Calls mount for release of Palestinian protester held by ICE for nearly a yearRead moreAyotte, a Republican, said in a press release that DHS provided the documents to her office for the first time on Thursday. Her remarks seemed to conflict with testimony from Todd Lyons, ICE’s acting director, who told a Senate hearing earlier that same day that DHS representatives had already discussed the project with the governor and supplied “an economic impact summary” to her.TheMassachusettsgovernor, Maura Healey, issued astatementopposing the creation of an ICE agency detention center in Merrimack, calling it “outrageous and absolutely the wrong move”.“ICE isshooting peopledead on the street. Mothers have been ripped from cars and separated from children,” the statement said. “US Citizens have been stopped, detained and even killed. Peaceful protesters have been assaulted. Parents are afraid to send kids to school, to go to church, to seek healthcare and report crimes. None of this makes people safer – it makes us all less safe.”It continued: “We should be opposing ICE’s tactics, not allowing them to expand.

It was the verge of the 1970s and his father, Felin, was losing the family farm to Cuba’s 10-year-old communist regime. A push called the Revolutionary Offensive was under way, mobilising the people to sow, clean and harvest 10m tonnes of sugar cane in an effort to makeCubafinancially independent. The land needed to be cleared.For decades the family had nurtured their 800 hectares of rich loam alongside the meandering Sagua River. Eight couples, all related, worked the fields, while Felix and his sister had fruitful adventures among the royal palms, avocado, mango and magnificent ceiba.“The sappers arrived,” Felix writes in his family memoir. “A gang of agile men who opened holes in the roots and placed charges of dynamite. There was a terrible roar and the trees flew into the sky, defying gravity, then fell shuddering with broken branches.”Felix is my father-in-law, and I recall this moment when I think about Cuba’s revolution, which is often as the country spirals into tragedy around me.Avast human experiment is coming to an end. Fidel and Raúl Castro’s communist revolution is crumbling, to be replaced by … we know not what. The US government, after six decades of aggression, is seeking the endgame. The Trump administration, newly energised from decapitating Venezuela’s Bolivarian revolution, is looking for “assets” within the Cuban government, and briefing of warships enforcing a total oil blockade. “Make a deal before it’s too late,” PresidentDonald Trumptold Cuba’s leaders.The Americans are facing a country where the lazy tourist’s recommendation – “See it before it changes” – no longer applies. In the pit of an economic slump, the island has gone from being run-down and picturesque to a horror show. The economy contracted by 11% between 2019 and 2024, with a further 5% fall through September 2025. Rubbish fills the streets, picked over by burgeoning bands of beggars. Rolling power cuts rack the island, spoiling the little food people have in their fridges, and making it hard to sleep. Anyone who protests is met with authoritarian force.It’s not the first time Cubans have gone hungry. The “special period in a time of peace” following the collapse of the Soviet Union saw people begin to starve. But those who lived through those times say these are different. The government, out of money and ideas, has allowed a small super-class of Cubans to emerge, licensed to import products including food. But inflation means very few can afford their goods. “In the special period things were very bad, because there was no food, but we had hope,” said Carlos Bustamante, a film producer. “Now there is food, if you can afford it, but no hope.”View image in fullscreenRolling power cuts now rack the city …View image in fullscreen… and rubbish is piled up on the streets. Photographs: Jason P Howe/The GuardianThe wealthy drive Mercedes and Dodge Rams past the famous 1950s Ford Fairlanes and 1970s Russian Ladas. In the special period neighbour helped neighbour, but such communitarianism is collapsing. Every generation is affected by the crisis, but none more so than the one that built the revolution, who rallied to the call to put aside personal gain for the common good. It was they who volunteered to cut cane during that 10m-­tonne harvest, on the understanding that they would be provided with food and healthcare until they died.The revolution raised many out of poverty, its great achievement. But it is now beggaring them again.For some it was enough. I stop an old man sweeping the path outside his house in Havana’s Vedado neighbourhood. Darío Díaz Machado says he was a lieutenant colonel in FAR, the revolutionary army. His 4,500 pesos a month pension may only be worth $10, but his son, a surgeon in Spain, sends money.“I was a peasant, working the land,” he says. “After the triumph of the revolution I began to attend schools and improve myself. I’ve come this far. I feel happy.”This is not a widely held view. An estimated 20% of the population – among them the best and brightest – have emigrated since the pandemic, often with children. The shock on the faces of their elderly and increasingly lonely relatives matches the state of their clothes.Martha Ortega was a secretary in a Communist party office in central Havana. She now lives with her daughter, who is deaf and mute, on a pension inflation has reduced to $5 a month. “We lived with a dream, with a devotion. And then everything was gone,” she tells me.What Cubans now live with is an electricity grid that regularly collapses. The first time it happened, in October 2024, I was making breakfast for my then two-year-old boy, Santiago. Five days of blackout also meant the water supply had failed. He was potty training, and turning to check on him, I discovered he’d pooed on the floor, putting his dirty hands to his face.I looked at the useless taps, aware that our cupboard of imported medicines didn’t include anything for conjunctivitis. Picking him up, I thought: what are we doing here? Many have no choice, but we do.Part of it is that my wife, a literary professor at the University of Havana, has never wanted to go. We’ve lived together for eight years in her small apartment overlooking the Florida Straits and she remains in awe of her home city. “All this,” she’ll say, looking at some magnificent building. “In the Caribbean.”View image in fullscreenNicoll’s in-laws, Felix and Yohanka, with his wife and son in Havana.Photograph: Jason P Howe/The GuardianBut all her friends have gone. A graduate of the once meritocratic powerhouse of a high school, La Lenin, she shared a dorm with friends who are now spread across North America. They wonder why she won’t go, too. Instead she heads off to classes during the extended power cuts in the hope that her students will turn up in the gloom (they usually do).But part of it is me. Cubans now refer to themselves as a “third world country”. Marco Rubio, the US’s Cuban-American secretary of state, who is at the forefront of the administration’s effort to change the Havana regime, called it “fourth world”. This makes me furious because neither is true. Or at least it wasn’t. Cuba is something else, something unique and terrifying, which is what this article is about.Icame of age in Scotland when the Berlin Wall fell, and was told the good guys won and the bad guys lost. Felix heard it differently. In the 1980s he had left the house in Santa Clara in which the family had been resettled from the farm, to study philosophy. He boarded a ship in Havana Bay and set off across the Atlantic to study in the Soviet Union. The cruise liner refuelled in Algeciras, Cuba’s communist students shouting down to Spain’s until recently fascist stevedores. Then it was through the Bosphorus, and a landing in Odesa.There Felix met Yohanka, also Cuban, also a philosopher. (You get used to this sort of thing if you live in Cuba: I like to fish and Felipe, my Cuban guide, is a trained psychologist.) Felix and Yohanka were beneficiaries of a revolution determined to educate. “Without education there is no revolution,” Fidel Castro said. Yet all attempts to pay for this education were failing. The sugar harvest that saw Felix’s beloved trees blown up fell short by between 1.5m and 2.5m tonnes, and was soon excised from national conversation.View image in fullscreenFelix and Yohanka after meeting in the USSR in the 1980s.Photograph: courtesy of Felix Valdés GarcíaOther attempts to centrally plan prosperity sputtered into life. There was an ambition to build a network of nuclear power stations, which collapsed after Chornobyl, a bioengineering sector to manufacture drugs, which was met with an international shrug, and a tourism industry that necklaced the best beaches on the island with ugly all-inclusive hotels. Without capitalism’s glinting edge, the government’s money-making attempts either limped on or collapsed. Each time I pass through Havana’s José Martí airport, I laugh at a billboard attempting to encourage medical tourism. It shows a smiling couple saying, “I choose Cuba to procreate.” I mean, I chose Cuba to procreate, but I wouldn’t have put it quite like that.Doctors have been trained by the thousand, and sent to more than 160 countries on medical missions. These have been a subject of pride and scandal: the doctors earn up to $1,000 a month while the state charges the host country five times that.Nothing has given the island – 777 miles long, with a historic population of 11 million – the velocity to escape the financial kindness of other nations. Instead, the economy has lurched from one crisis to another, as insidious sweetheart deals have been done with Russia, Venezuela, Iran and China. Meanwhile, the fundamental infrastructure rots. “This country has never been economically independent,” says Katrin Hansing, a professor of anthropology at the City University of New York. “Full stop, since colonial times.”The government blames its woes – with justification – on the US and its decades-long economic embargo. Others – with equal justification – point to ageing political leaders ineptly running a moribund, centrally planned state. What is certain is that the vast majority of Cubans on the island no longer care who is to blame.As 2024 turned into 2025, we took a family trip to Viñales. If you have visited Cuba, you will probably know it: a village in the island’s west in a valley full of mogotes, steep-sided rocky hills. There was a pig roast, presided over by a local lad sporting a solid-gold chain and a vast medallion. I liked his shtick. He’d made money trading cars. His children were like little Mowglis, charging around bareback on horses, before falling asleep together in a hammock.But my parents-in-law eyed him in confusion. “He’s just not emancipated,” Felix said. I’d laughed, teasing him, but I kept thinking about it afterwards. It reminded me of a line in Secondhand Time, Svetlana Alexievich’s Nobel prize-winning book of interviews with people after the fall of the Soviet Union. “There were new rules,” one said. “If you have money, you count – no money, you’re nothing. Who cares if you’ve read all of Hegel?”I tell the story to Hansing, the City University of New York professor, who is a classic example of the curious people you meet on the island. She arrived in Cuba in the 1980s as a teenager, daughter of South African anti-apartheid activists. She was educated on Cuba’s Isle of Youth alongside students from a slew of African countries, part of Fidel Castro’s then global outreach.“I know so many people who grew up in the early years of the revolution who became professionals, doctors, engineers, university professors, journalists,” she says. “But their children or grandchildren, if they haven’t been able to leave, are now doing manual labour because it pays better.” She is grim about the future: “There’s a growing sense of not only anti-intellectualism, but anti-education among many young people.”For many Cubans, these are the questions: what have I lived through? What was all that for? What was my life?Cuba’s revolutionaries made the island an icon of the international left. In some ways it still is. In January, there was a gathering to mark the anniversary of the 1966 Tricontinental Conference which drew anti-colonialists from all over the world. And yet lately, the government’s apparent acceptance of the suffering of its people has been causing a degree of circumspection even among true believers. Heinz Bierbaum is a former president of the European Left who, as chair of the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation, is a regular visitor to the island. “Solidarity with Cuba is very important because it’s a socialist country in an unfavourable environment,” he says. “But we have to talk about the situation, to enter a dialogue with the government about the problems.” (To be fair, he told me this before the US assault on Venezuela, which is bound to harden opinions again.)It didn’t have to be like this. In 2016, then US president Barack Obama flew into Havana to “bury the last remnants of the cold war”. He was greeted by a population who believed fundamentally in free healthcare and education. It wouldn’t have been a reach for Cuba to give its people a little opportunity, allowing them to earn money while asking them to pay decent taxes towards such benefits. But the government didn’t think so, at least not on any effective scale. Instead it cleaved to policies that maintained its control of the economy, often in baffling ways. A programme of hotel building has been under way, with 7,000 more rooms added since 2019, despite tourist numbers halving in the same period. And no one answers the question why.Meanwhile, in 2021 came a unification of two currencies, one pegged to the US dollar, one local, which resulted in hyperinflation that collapsed the value of state sector pay and pensions. The minister responsible, Alejandro Gil, was charged, convicted and given a life sentence for corruption and, more startlingly, espionage. Again, no further explanations were given.Michael Bustamante, chair of Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami, and one of the most fair-minded observers of the island, says the government has “missed every opportunity” to make the economy better, and the effects are heartbreaking. Children who would once have had to answer to the police if seen on the streets in school hours now use the time to beg. Parents struggle. A friend received a call from her sons’ school after a rainstorm asking that she pick them up. A lack of gas meant they had been cooking lunch for the children over fire, but their wood got wet.Doctors battle on, working in dirty hospitals, sharing any functioning machines, doing what they can. But once-vaunted infant mortality rates have doubled and even the government admits medicines are scarce.View image in fullscreenAmerican cars from the 1950s can still be seen on the streets of Havana …View image in fullscreen… and young Cubans still play football in Antonio Maceo Park. Photographs: Jason P Howe/The GuardianAnd people keep leaving. There are no firm figures but estimates are as high as 2 million. My wife’s speciality is the literature of emigration, her PhD on writers making sense of their broken families and exile. Her subject has been Haiti, a deflection not lost on her.Across the Florida Straits, Cuba’s exile community watches events on the island carefully, sensing the end even as they struggle with this latest, unprecedentedly large, influx of refugees. In an office on the 11th floor of a glittering building in Miami’s Brickell mall, Pedro Freyre is one of the city’s leading attorneys. The 76-year-old is exile aristocracy, his family having fled a beautiful house on Havana’s Fifth Avenue ahead of the revolution. His brother fought against the Castros in the Bay of Pigs and his brother-in-law died there.Cuban Americans are proud of their relationship with their adopted country, he says. “We were well received, well treated. And, as the song says, we built this city.”Despite his family history, Freyre was closely involved in the effort to bring investment to Cuba during the thaw in relations started by Obama. “Trump’s people were there,” he says. “You see the property that they were looking at as you fly in. It had a landing strip, and he was going to build a golf course.”He has lost patience now, saying many Cuban Americans would support intervention – something I never hear in Cuba itself. He calls nonsense on my suggestion that the revolution gave Cubans a unique intellectualism. “That’s a very Cuban tradition that has been around since the inception – think of José de la Luz y Caballero and José Martí.”My cultural awakening: A Queen song helped me break free from communist CubaRead moreThis remark brings me up short and I mull it as I drive away. I think also of pre-revolutionary artist Wifredo Lam, writer Alejo Carpentier and singer Benny Moré. Then I look around, at Miami’s flatlands full of strip malls and faux-this-and-that houses. Cubans may have built this city, but they didn’t do it with any poetry.Still, I am on my way to meet a man who will shed no tears if the revolution collapses, who has experienced the darkest side of its legacy. In a small apartment under the flight path into Miami airport, I find José Daniel Ferrer, who for much of this century has been de facto head of the Cuban opposition. On and off, he has spent 12 years in Cuba’s jails as a political prisoner (one of nearly 1,200, according to human rights group Prisoners Defenders). “I saw things I never thought a human being in the western hemisphere could see,” he says, including being held in darkness for months, force-fed, attacked by both guards and prisoners. He says he watched two men get beaten to death.Despite this, he always refused to leave Cuba, determined to be a thorn in the side of the government from within, but in October last year he’d had enough and accepted exile. “There is nothing to lose with the fall of the regime,” he says bitterly. “Rather we will gain freedom, opportunity and prosperity.”The worst years of his incarceration, he says, came after 2016. It’s a reminder that, even if everything had gone smoothly following Obama’s visit, it’s unlikely Cuba would have easily pivoted into a cosy social democracy. “Cuba hasn’t had a democracy, let alone a social democracy, since 1952, so there is a lot of work to be done,” says Bustamante, the University of Miami academic. “And the tenor of political discourse among Cubans doesn’t give me high hope for the defence of democratic values.”Indeed, inside Cuba, misery has led to a cyclone of cynicism, projected in bitter humour. During the last May Day celebrations, a joke circulated that the vast annual march, when workers are bussed in from all corners, would no longer lead to the city’s Plaza de la Revolucion … but instead to the psychiatric hospital.For those the revolution educated, the sad last act of the great experiment appears to be extraordinary individual tragedies. Says Hansing, “For many of the Cubans I know, these are the questions: what have I lived through? What was all that for? What was my life?”Reading this article, my father-in-law Felix said sadly, “You [he meant western Europeans, Americans] use communism as a hammer, but to me it remains a beautiful idea – perhaps the most beautiful idea.”Idrive my family down the island for a cousin’s wedding. We take the northern road, past the tourist beaches of Varadero and along a crumbling highway next to Cuba’s palm-fringed coast. Despite the power cuts and lack of gasoline, it remains a journey I love above almost all others.The people we pass appear exhausted, as if waiting for something they can no longer even articulate. My wife and I have made a habit of exploring Cuba’s sideroads and we do so again, arriving by chance at a hotel once known for its natural springs. The whole family get out. The lobby is clean and the shop is open, selling beach towels and hats. The staff are welcoming, their uniforms pressed. The swimming pool is empty and there are no guests. I ask when the last came through and the receptionist tells me four years ago.Later, at the wedding in Sagua La Grande, where the power cuts are now more than 16 hours a day, the priest tells the congregation not to throw rice, but to instead give it to the happy couple.View image in fullscreenFelix’s father, Felin, on the family farm …View image in fullscreen… and Felix with his mother (on white horse) in 1970. Photographs: courtesy of Felix Valdés GarcíaStill caught by the story of the sappers blowing up the family’s trees, I suggest we visit the farm on the way back to Havana, and plant a few fresh saplings. From the highway, I see the gesture is unnecessary. The whole place has turned to thick forest. But Felix has brought a tree anyway, a lemon that had grown from a discarded fruit in the Santa Clara house in the years after his father, Felin, died in 2021.We pick our way through the woods, through rattlebush and punarnava, Felix plunging ahead with such intent, I worry the rest of us will lose him. Finally we emerge into a clearing where the Caribbean sun is diffused by the canopy.Nothing remains of the farm, not even the foundations of the house. We stand astonished. All traces of Felin’s work, of the eight couples who lived here, have disappeared. All the pain and sadness Felin suffered on losing his land was unnecessary, and is now forgotten by everyone except this family.I start digging. My boy Santiago runs over to help, pulling up rich, fecund soil with his little hands. When it is deep enough, Felix plants the lemon tree.We press down the roots and christen it with water. A burst of sunlight draws out the deep green of its leaves and a yellow butterfly, magnificent and huge, floats by. We all watch it go, its journey as random as madness.Explore more on these topicsCubaAmericasTariffsDonald TrumpCommunismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However this is simply not true. Some films – both documentary and narrative – have not only changed public opinion about social issues but led directly to legislation. Despite evidence to the contrary, politicians are people too. They can be moved. And sometimes they are even moved to action.A Fantastic WomanSebastián Lelio’s 2017 drama about a transgender woman fighting to be accepted by her dead partner’s family was a huge success internationally, winning the best foreign language film Oscar. But it was in Chile, where it was filmed and set, that it had the biggest impact. Lelio was invited to the presidential palace by Chile’s then-president Michelle Bachelet,who tweeted: “It was an honor to have the team of A Fantastic Woman here in La Moneda, the people’s house.” The film helped change the political climate in Chile and led to the passing of itsgender identity law, which had been stuck in congress for five years.View image in fullscreenDaniela Vega in A Fantastic Woman.Photograph: Sony Pictures Classics/AllstarA Girl in the RiverIn 2016, Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy won her second Oscar for A Girl in the River: The Price of Forgiveness, a short documentary about “honour” killings in Pakistan. In heracceptance speech, she said: “This week, the Pakistani prime minister has said that he will change the law on ‘honour’ killing after watching this film. That is the power of film.” ThePakistani government passed a lawlegislating stricter punishments for such murders and closing legal loopholes that enabled killers to escape punishment by obtaining forgiveness from family members.A Handful of AshFilm-makers Shara Amin and Nabaz Ahmed spent 10 years on the roads in Kurdistanspeaking to women and menabout the impact of female genital mutilation. The resulting documentary had a profound effect on lawmakers, and in 2011, the Kurdistan parliament passed a billoutlawing the practice. “Showing the film in parliament was a great breakthrough for us,” Ahmedtold the Guardian.FGM: ‘It’s like neutering animals’ – the film that is changing KurdistanRead moreCathy Come Home“You don’t care. You only pretend to care.” Perhaps the BBC’s most famous television play, Ken Loach’s 1966 TV film about a woman’s descent into poverty challenged the nation’s views on homelessness. The film had an undeniable impact, though its influence was slower than many realise. There were some immediate results:the film led to the creation of the homelessness charity Crisisjust a few months after its broadcast. But it wasn’t until 1977 that the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act was passed, stipulating that homeless families like Cathy’s had a right to be rehoused by the council.Mr Bates vsthe Post OfficeView image in fullscreenShaun Dooley in Mr Bates vs the Post Office.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockDespite people campaigning for years for justice following the Post Office Horizon scandal, it took the broadcast of a four-part ITV dramato get politicians to finally act. But act they did, by passing the Post Office (Horizon System) Compensation Act 2024 and Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024. Though not a cinematic release, Mr Bates is a clear example of powerful onscreen storytelling exposing injustice and applying pressure to enact change.SilencedBefore creating Squid Game,Hwang Dong-hyukdirected the 2011 drama Silenced, about the sexual abuse of deaf children at Gwangju Inhwa school in South Korea. The film depicts not only the crimes but also the inadequate justice that followed, sparking public outrage. The Korean National Assembly passed the “Dogani law” (named after the Korean title of the film), which scrapped the statute of limitations for sexual crimes against children under 13 and disabled people.The Day AfterArundhati Roy quits Berlin film festival over ‘stay out of politics’ commentRead moreNicholas Meyer’s television filmabout a nuclear attack on the US was watched by more than 100 million people when it aired in 1983. One of the people watching was the president. Ronald Reagan wrote in his diary that night that the film was, “very effective and left me greatly depressed … My own reaction was one of our having to do all we can to have a deterrent and to see there is never a nuclear war.” The drama helped shift Reagan’s mind on US nuclear policy and he adopted a more diplomatic approach that led to the signing ofthe Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1987.The Snake PitAnatole Litvak co-directed the Why We Fight series of propaganda films with Frank Capra, but his 1948 psychological drama The Snake Pit did as much as his documentaries to shift opinion. It tells the story of a woman called Virginia in a psychiatric hospital who can’t remember how she got there. The “snake pit” refers to a large padded room where patients who are deemed beyond help are left and abandoned. Several US states changed laws to improve conditions in psychiatric hospitals as a result.Explore more on these topicsFilmWim WendersBerlin film festivalFestivalsA Fantastic WomanFemale genital mutilation (FGM)HomelessnessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The interviewer Quodri (Anwar Hashimi) is icily misogynist about this new woman he has to work with and when the Taliban chief inevitably walks out of the interview on the grounds that Naru is not sufficiently covering her head, he orders her to get out of the van on the way back to the station, ordering her to do fatuous vox-pops about Valentine’s Day.It is intended as a meaningless humiliation, but Naru does a great job; women open up to her about the awfulness of their men in a way they never would to a man. The chiefs are impressed and she is also is a very important part in securing a big story about a rape case. Quodri himself appears to turn his attitudes around 180 degrees, and this married man embarks on a new, extra-marital admiration for Naru, with a real regard for her professional abilities. It’s a romance which reaches its crisis as Naru’s precarious rights are threatened both by the Taliban and her vengeful husband and Kabul falls to the theocrat bullies: a political catastrophe which affects women far more than men.It’s a shrewd, pointed film – almost a kind of bookend to Samira Makhmalbaf’s very much more serious and un-westernised At Five in the Afternoon (2003) about women’s rights under Taliban rule being upended by the arrival of US troops during the Bush/Cheney “war on terror” – an invasion which caused forward-thinking ideas to be abandoned as the nation reverted to anti-women attitudes in the fever of war. This is a contemporary romance and the kind of film that tells you things about Afghanistan that aren’t covered in our own nightly news.No Good Men is screening at theBerlin film festivaland will be released at a later dateExplore more on these topicsBerlin film festival 2026First look reviewBerlin film festivalFestivalsRomance filmsDrama filmsAfghanistanreviewsShareReuse this content"

William Nicholson’s take on CS Lewis’s marriage to an American divorcee is that of late-found passion, terminal illness and a crisis of the celebrated writer’s Christian faith. In all its iterations, it is an old-fashioned weepie. In this production, originally staged atChichester Festival theatre, it just feels old-fashioned.It has charm and pulls you into its sadness but seems as creaky as the half-filled, wood-panelled library in its backdrop. There is too much a sense of a drama unfolding, from the moment Lewis (Hugh Bonneville) receives a letter from American fan, Joy Davidman (Maggie Siff), to his slow falling in love and her descent into illness.Directed by Rachel Kavanaugh, it plods from one scene to the next, sleepy in pace and action but breezy in its emotions. The loves story seems to sit apart from the thoughts on faith and suffering that Lewis voices at university podium lectures.Bonneville is a lovely presence, as always, and he certainly knows how to play emotionally reserved Englishmen, (there has been the Earl of Grantham in Downton Abbey and the cautious dad from Paddington). But although he channels awkwardness with aplomb, he lacks the hard, anguished depths that show Lewis’s stunting shyness and repression. He also emanates warmth, carrying an almost physical sense that he is, for all Lewis’s inhibitions, a big (bear) hug of a presence on stage. Siff is excellent as Joy, bringing sharp edges and ardour but the chemistry between them is just too fond and gentle.Lewis’s fellow dons at Oxford University are cardboard characters, mouthing viewpoints on God, women – and Joy, whom they regard as an aggressive American – while Peter McKintosh’s set design does little to build this world and bring it to life. It leaves a vacuum in atmosphere, the stage woefully empty.There aresomescenes that penetrate, especially the exhilarating moment that Lewis and Joy declare their love for each other, circling around the other. The rapport between Lewis and his older brother (Jeff Rawle) with whom he lives, is amusing as well. But as a story of love and grief, it should have you in bits. Love found, so late, an emotionally remote man thawed by it, and then lost again, his love an open wound. It does not feel as eviscerating as it should.Nicholson’s script is adapted from his own Bafta award-winning TV film and that is just what it feels like here: a made for TV tear-jerker.AtAldwych theatre, London, until 9 MayExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreHugh BonnevilleCS LewisreviewsShareReuse this content"

Thirty-one years on from the release of their debut album, they find themselves, as frontman Chino Moreno has put it, “literally bigger than we’ve ever been”. Between the release of 2020’s Ohms and last year’s Private Music their monthly listener figures on Spotify surged from two million to 17 million. The 15,000-capacity venue where they open their UK tour is accordingly heaving.The reason, with a certain inevitability, is TikTok virality. Tonight, Deftones’ setlist is liberally peppered with tracks ubiquitous on the social media app, from opener Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away) to encore Cherry Waves – although why its users have alighted on them is a matter of conjecture. On fan forums, opinions range from the practical (younger listeners discovered the band after emo rappers sampled their music) to the more earthy: there is discussion of a phenomenon called – dear God - “hornycore” into which the Deftones apparently fit because Moreno has “sexual tones” and is “a fox/daddy”.Whatever the reason, you can see its effects in the Birmingham crowd: grizzled battle jacket-clad metalheads and people visibly old enough to remember the release of Deftones’ 1997 breakthrough Around the Fur rub shoulders with tweenage goths, any putative parent-scaring qualities about their look – boys in makeup, girls in tights festooned with pentagrams – undermined by the fact that they’re actually here with their parents.View image in fullscreenMoreno takes the spotlight.Photograph: Clemente RuizAnd as Deftones play in front of a giant screen filled with trippy clips from Jodorowsky’s avant-garde arthouse classic Holy Mountain, it’s hard not to think of their renaissance as a good-will-out just reward. If you can see why they got tagged nu-metal 25 years ago – brawny pit-inciting riffs over rhythms that bear a pronounced hip-hop influence – they were, from the start, possessed of both a far wider musical bandwidth and a noticeably different emotional temperature than the genre suggests.The preponderance of flanged basslines and effects-laden guitar on Change (In the House of Flies) underline more than a passing familiarity with the 80s oeuvre of Siouxsie and the Banshees and the Cure. Elsewhere, on 2006’s Cherry Waves and last year’s Infinite Source alike, the guitars arrive in blurry waves of distortion. Deftones spent considerably more time in the company of My Bloody Valentine’s Loveless than their peers, which both demonstrates excellent taste and seems weirdly prescient. In 2026, you can’t move for hazy-sounding music from a variety of genres that you can ultimately trace back to My Bloody Valentine’s innovations: in a sense, Deftones were shoegaze revivalists before there actually was a shoegazing revival.Deftones singer Chino Moreno: ‘I’ve got hundreds of drawings of myself in my house’Read moreThe effect is incredibly powerful. Rather than temper-tantrum angst, the band’s overall mood is oddly reflective and melancholy: the sound of Moreno’s voice in more recumbent mode – floating above the melee on Hole in the Earth or Locked Club – doesn’t feel sexual so much as wistful. Moreover, it’s an effect they’ve managed to maintain for a long time: if there isn’t any noticeable cooling in the audience’s ardour when the band shift from a beloved old song to something off Private Music, that’s probably because there’s no noticeable dip in musical quality.Moreover, what they do never feels vintage, like a dispatch from history that brings about a warm glow of nostalgia. There’s nothing beyond their confidence to suggest Deftones are the best part of 40 years away from their formation – “est 1988”, as the T-shirts on the merch stand put it. If a new band came up with something like this – and wrote songs this good – you suspect they’d be doing exceptionally fine business too. Perhaps that’s ultimately what’s at the root of Deftones’ renaissance: their younger fans aren’t buying into a myth of the past, but something that sounds like the present.Deftones play OVO Hydro, Glasgow, 13 February; thentouringExplore more on these topicsDeftonesMetalreviewsShareReuse this content"

Ever since the first set of photos were released, the anachronisms of the costumes have been central to the conversation.As fashion industry watchdogDiet Pradaput it: “The costume design for Emerald Fennell’s Wuthering Heights scandalised audiences with its freaky mix of Oktoberfest corseting meets 1950’s ballgowns meets futuristic liquid organza meets … Barbie?”Viewers will soon be able to see Oscar-winning costume designer Jacqueline Durran’s artistic vision.View image in fullscreenCathy’s wedding dress is made from a material resembling cellophane, as if she’s been giftwrapped for her husband.Photograph: 2026 Warner Bros. Ent/PAThe film plays fast and loose with period costume.Durran told Vogue: “We’re not representing a moment in time at all.” The mood board for Cathy’s costumes included Thierry Mugler, Alexander McQueen, a German milkmaid-style, and Elizabethan, Georgian, Victorian and contemporary fashion. “The challenge was to distill that into looks that told the story that Emerald wanted to tell,” Durran says.Storytelling – and spectacle – rather than a quest for historical accuracy lead Cathy to wear a dress in a material resembling cellophane on her wedding night, as if she’s a gift wrapped for her husband.Wuthering Heights is part of a movement of costume design disobedient to historical accuracy in favour of creative freedom – and, arguably, fun. Costume designer Kate Hawley acknowledges her Oscar-nominated work on Guillermo del Toro’s Frankenstein is also far from historically accurate. In Yorgos Lanthimos’ 2023 filmPoor Things, set in the late Victorian era, Bafta-winning costume designer Holly Waddington used modern fabrics such as plastic and latex. She was, she told the Guardian, “playing with the period, not being slavish to it and playing with material qualities and pushing the boundaries of colours and textures”.View image in fullscreenBridgerton was a catalyst for the trend of mixing modern elements into period dramas.Photograph: Liam Daniel/NetflixWhile there are forebears – in 2006, Sofia Coppola’s Marie Antoinette, costume designer Milena Canonero placed a pair of Converse in the young queen’s wardrobe – Keith Lodwick, a theatre and film historian, cites the “Bridgerton effect” as a catalyst. From its first series in 2020, it’s been what he calls “a fantasy version of what we might think Regency is about”.“Timing is everything,” says Lodwick. “Bridgerton came when we were having this global pandemic, and it was such escapism.” A moment for more expressive costume design often tallies with a wider world in need of fantasy. Referencing the 1940s film Pride and Prejudice, he says, “it’s very hard to pinpoint exactly what they’re recreating. It’s kind of Regency, but there’s a bit of 1840s-50s coming into it.” Regardless, for a 1940 audience, he says, “it was a huge success because it was an escape from the beginnings of the second world war.”For some, this current mood for anachronisms is being overstated. Helen Walter, costume and visual historian at the Arts University Bournemouth, isn’t “sure it’s as big or as unprecedented a shift as people are making it out to be”. Costume design, she says, “often says much more about the people who are making it than the original setting … it always says something about the time that it’s being made.”View image in fullscreenSofia Coppola’s Marie Antoinette was not concerned with historical accuracy.Photograph: I Want Candy LLC. and Zoetrope CorpTrue historical accuracy is also not actually possible. According to Waddington: “Every period thinks that they’re doing the period, but they never really are [there are] always telltale signs.”When Oscar-winning costume designer Sandy Powell did Shakespeare in Love, she says “all of the silhouettes were the correct period cuts for all the clothing, but you can’t necessarily find period-accurate fabrics because they’re just not made in the same way now”. Powell remembers upsetting somebody by using an art deco lace to make an Elizabethan collar. “I thought, ‘Well, I don’t care,” she says. “It looks good. And actually, this isn’t a documentary’.”Costume, says Walter, “like any other art form is not immune to fashion and general cultural trends”. But designers will ultimately be led by the film in question. “I do whatever feels right for the piece,” says Powell. her upcoming work on The Bride! starring Jessie Buckley, is true to period but takes an anachronistic mood to “how clothes are worn more than the actual items of clothing”.“It’s almost as if the punk that we know from, let’s say, the 70s or 80s, existed in the 1930s. What would it look like?” Often working with a lot of artistic licence, with the Bride! she “had free rein to have fun and go mad with it but all within the period.”View image in fullscreenPoor Things brought modern fabrics and patterns to the late Victorian era.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamySome argue less accuracy-driven design creates a more distinct identity. It can, as in the case of Poor Things, lead to what Waddington calls a more “poetic response to the text” where “a striving for period correctness … would have given us a different tone.” For Powell, “when it’s done well, it’s fun. When it’s done badly I find it grating.”Waddington disagrees with the idea that modern costumes help modern audiences connect to films set out of their period. “The brilliant thing about tackling a period story or text,” she says, “is often the opportunity to try to bring to life a period in time”. She describes it as giving an audience an experience akin to “time travel”.Although, in the midst of this general mood for anachronisms, she “would kill to do an Elizabethan drama where everyone has wooden teeth”.Explore more on these topicsFashionCostume & cultureWuthering HeightsPoor ThingsBridgertonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Books have long functioned as cultural shorthand for personality – signals of taste and worldview – but dating apps have accelerated and intensified that process. In an attention economy that rewards speed, these signifiers have to be legible at a glance.“I prefer contemporary literary fiction or interesting classics in the broadest sense,” Ayo says. “Authors such as Ben Lerner, Sheila Heti,Annie Ernaux– if someone mentions one of those, I’ll be impressed and intrigued. And if it’s a Fitzcarraldo, I’m more likely to match regardless of whether I’ve read it or not.”The modern dating profile is something of a compressed CV. Saying you love romance might hint at emotional openness; fantasy or sci-fi might suggest nerdiness; poetry gestures at sensitivity; modernism at seriousness (or at least the desire to appear serious). Plus, the thrill of spotting someone who loves the same novel as you can feel like fate.Platform data shared with the Guardian suggests daters are increasingly leaning on book-based signals. In the last year, mentions of reading in Tinder bios in the UK are up 29% overall and 41% among women. On dating app Feeld, about 7% of UK profiles explicitly mention reading; users who connect with other readers are almost 10% more likely to report a “meaningful connection”. On Hinge, “book” is one of the most frequent words that daters around the world share in their responses to the prompt “My simple pleasures”.View image in fullscreenMore than a third of Americans find profiles that mention books more attractive … Ben Lerner.Photograph: Ulf Andersen/Getty ImagesData from freelancer platform 99designs released this month showed that 42% of Americans want a partner who reads regularly, and 38% find profiles that mention books more attractive. The message is clear: books are doing some very heavy lifting in the dating economy.“It’s not hard to see the appeal,” says Luke Brunning, a philosophy lecturer at the University of Leeds and co-director of itsCentre for Love, Sex and Relationships. “The excitement of seeing someone who enjoys the niche book you love can be real, abiding and tell us something about their taste and character.”Erinne Paisley, a researcher studying digital intimacy at the University of Copenhagen, agrees. “We live in an age of anxiety and some of this can be a connection to safety – we want to get a full picture of someone because the version of ourselves on dating apps is fragmented,” she says.I was in a ‘situationship’ with a guy who ran a Ulysses book group ... I’ve still never read it because of thatThese signals are increasingly sorted into the language of “green flags” and “red flags” – a discourse turbocharged by social media, where certain titles or genres are treated as instant proxies for someone’s values, politics or emotional availability.The paradox is that books are now both a badge of authenticity and a performance. That tension – between actual taste and strategic signalling – maps on to the“performative men” discourse: the suspicion that some men curate feminist politics or literary taste as a dating strategy rather than them being their authentically held beliefs and preferences.Caitlin, 25, has seen both sides of this. “At university I was in a life-shattering ‘situationship’ with a guy who ran a Ulysses book group,” she says. “Even at the time, when I really liked him, I thought it was a bit of an ick. I’ve still never read it because of that dating experience.” Dating someone a few years later, she was initially thrilled to see Virginia Woolf’s A Room of One’s Own on a man’s bookshelf alongside a host of books by women – a green flag, she thought, proof of feminist sensibilities. “And then he just turned out to be terrible, too.”View image in fullscreenOne dater was initially thrilled to see Virginia Woolf’s A Room of One’s Own on a man’s bookshelf – but ‘then he just turned out to be terrible, too’.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyOthers also describe the letdown when the performance collapses in real life. “I had aBen LernerHinge prompt up for six months in the hopes that one day someone would reply, and they’d be the one,” says Ella*. The prompt did eventually get her a date: “Unfortunately, he wasn’t it – just a lawyer who lectured me on Tarkovsky.” Harry’s* worst date was with someone whose profile said she was writing a book, only for her to admit over drinks that she had completed an English literature degree without reading a single book and couldn’t name one she enjoyed.But dating shortcuts can also risk flattening people into types, and can sometimes invite bias. A love of airport novels doesn’t preclude emotional or intellectual depth, just as a shelf of modernist doorstoppers doesn’t guarantee it.“Classism is the major risk,” Brunning says. “There can be many reasons why some people cannot read, read less than us, read different material to us, or are hesitant to disclose their reading habits. We should be careful not to let our prejudices exclude these people as potential partners.”Paisley also worries that there is a risk of turning dating into a consumer exercise, where people are discarded for minor mismatches in taste rather than engaged with as complex, evolving individuals.“Red flag discourse can be helpful when referring to dangerous or harmful behaviour, but it also can be harmful in that it encourages us to find a partner who ticks every box, who we have an initial spark with, and with whom that spark never wavers,” she says. “This isn’t how relationships always work. Think about friendships – there will be times of growth and negotiation.” If books have become dating shorthand, then perhaps they should be taken as a rough translation at best.*Some names have been changedExplore more on these topicsBooksBen LernerSheila HetiAnnie ErnauxJordan PetersonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Friday night on the southern outskirts of Milan, the Olympic Games reminded the sport, and perhaps Malinin himself, that predictability is never guaranteed on its biggest stage.The overwhelming favorite entering the free skate, the 21-year-old American instead saw the Olympic title slip away to Kazakhstan’s Mikhail Shaidorov after an error-strewn performance that will go down among the biggest shocks in figure skating history.Winter Olympics: Ilia Malinin misses podium in figure skating shock; Shaidorov takes gold – as it happenedRead moreShaidorov’s season-best total of 291.58 vaulted him from fifth after the short program as one favored contender after another faltered. Japan’s Yuma Kagiyama (280.06) and Shun Sato (274.90) took silver and bronze respectively on a night where even the sport’s most reliable jump technicians struggled to hold their programs together.Malinin entered the final segment with a lead of just over five points, a margin that under normal circumstances would have allowed him to skate conservatively and still win. It wasn’t to be.Malinin was the last of the 24 skaters to take to the ice, with the Olympic title seemingly within reach after his closest rivals faltered. He opened with a quad flip and quad lutz, but the mistakes quickly piled up. The planned quad axel was reduced to a single and later he fell on another quad lutz. He also doubled jumps he would normally complete with more rotations, though he salvaged points with a quad toe loop combination.View image in fullscreenGold medalist Mikhail Shaidorov shakes hands with Ilia Malinin after the finish.Photograph: Yara Nardi/ReutersHe finished with 156.33 in the free skate and 264.49 overall, left shockingly off the podium in a distant eighth place, nearly 30 points adrift of Shaidorov.The invincibility that has defined Malinin’s competitive aura over the past two seasons had been shattered.“I blew it,” Malinin said afterward. “That’s honestly the first thing that came to my mind. There’s no way that just happened. I was preparing the whole season and was so confident in my program, so confident with everything. I have no words really.”The result ended an unbeaten streak of more than two years spanning 14 competitions, including two world titles and three consecutive Grand Prix final victories. Entering the Milano Cortina Games, Malinin had redefined the technical boundaries of the sport, becoming the only skater in history toland the quadruple axel in competitionand building programs around record-level quad difficulty.Yet even before Friday, his Olympic experience had shown flashes of vulnerability. He was beaten by Kagiyama in the team event short program and later admitted the pressure of competing on Olympic ice had initially overwhelmed him. While he rebounded to help the United Statessecure team gold, his performances lacked the usual sense of technical inevitability.By Tuesday’s individual short program, that swagger appeared restored. Malinin took a five-point lead that felt insurmountable given his planned seven-quad free skate layout – the most difficult program ever attempted at the Olympics. At a practice at the US team’s alternate base in Bergamo hours before the final, he reportedly did not fall once. Then came a performance that will leave scars for years to come.“Definitely not a pleasant feeling,” Malinin said. “Training up all these years, going up to it, it honestly went by so fast. I didn’t have time to process what to do or anything. It all happens so fast.”By the end Malinin was skating largely for pride rather than placement. After he struck his final pose, he was visibly distraught.“The pressure of the Olympics really gets you,” Malinin said. “People say that there’s an Olympic curse, that the Olympic gold medal favorite is always going to skate bad at the Olympics. So that’s what happens.“The pressure is unreal. It’s really not easy, but I’m still proud of being able to get to the finish.”For the 21-year-old Shaidorov, the moment marked a career breakthrough and a milestone for Kazakhstan. His clean, composed free skate – built on five quads – including a quad lutz, toeloop and quad flip – proved exactly the type of performance that wins Olympic titles when favorites unravel. He looked as surprised as anyone when the final scores flashed and his placement was official.View image in fullscreenMikhail Shaidorov is Kazakhstan’s first Olympic champion in figure skating.Photograph: Wang Zhao/AFP/Getty ImagesHe became the first Kazakh Olympic figure skating champion, delivering his country’s first gold medal at these Games and its first gold in any Winter Olympic sport since Lillehammer 1994.Kagiyama’s silver marked his second consecutive Olympic runner-up finish, reinforcing his reputation as one of the sport’s most reliable championship performers. Sato’s bronze on his Olympic debut completed a strong night for Japan, whose technical depth again showed on the sport’s biggest stage.From vertigo to Van Gogh: 10 things you may have missed at the Winter OlympicsRead moreInside the arena, the atmosphere shifted from anticipation to disbelief as the standings solidified. What had seemed to be a coronation for Malinin instead became a reminder of the Olympic reality: that even generational dominance can dissolve in seven minutes of skating.For Malinin, the defeat is unlikely to change the broader trajectory of his career. At 21, he remains the sport’s most technically gifted skater and the architect of its current technical revolution. But on this night, Olympic history belonged to someone else. And for the first time in years, men’s figure skating suddenly feels open again.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Ilia MalininFigure skatingWinter OlympicsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

At the very least he will be allowed to remain at the Games to support his teammates after theInternational Olympic Committeereinstated his Olympic accreditation on Thursday afternoon, which is a step in the right direction from its blanket ban. But the damage has already been done. Amid the controversy and the wider issues, it is easy to forget that sport has also suffered. Heraskevych was a genuine medal hope for Ukraine and has worked his entire life to be here. Nobody has won from this situation: the IOC is now under intense scrutiny while Heraskevych has had his Olympic dream taken away.The IOC is obviously worried about the potential chaos if it did not protect the field of play but the messaging has been confusing. Kirsty Coventry, the IOC president, came out in tears after failed negotiations to persuade Heraskevych and his father to change their stance and then a spokesman, Mark Adams, took a more hardline approach, arguing that there were 130 conflicts going on in the world and that “once you start, as a sporting organisation, taking stands against wars and conflicts there is no end”.That the IOC allowed Heraskevych to wear his helmet in his six practice runs shows it concedes this is not a straightforward case, even offering a compromise to swap his “helmet of memory” for a black armband in competition on Thursday. The IOC also gave Heraskevych ample opportunities to show the helmet in the mixed media zone.There have been further inconsistencies. Earlier this week, the Ukrainian luge athlete Olena Smaha displayed the words “remembrance is not a violation” on her glove and she was allowed to compete. Heraskevych also pointed out that the Italian snowboarder Roland Fischnaller displayed a Russian flag on his helmet, for which there were no consequences. Russia is banned from competing here and the use of its flags was thought to be forbidden.View image in fullscreenYulianna Tunytska, Ihor Hoi, Nazarii Kachmar, Andriy Mandziy, Olena Stetskiv and Oleksandra Mokh of Ukraine raise their helmets in a tribute to Vladyslav Heraskevych.Photograph: Athit Perawongmetha/ReutersThe IOC’s ban centres on Rule 50.2 of the Olympic charter: “No kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas.” A key point here is that Heraskevych believes he is not breaking any rules: his central argument was that the images on his helmet were born of remembrance, not politics.We are athletes but we’re also human beings. We have passions and things that are really close to our hearts. As athletes we try to focus on our event and the task at hand, entering the Olympics without distraction and outside noise, but our lives do not take place in a vacuum.I don’t think anyone in the sliding community thinks Heraskevych was trying to distract or take advantage of the attention. Talking of peace doesn’t feel political. Watching his interviews after his disqualification, you can see the sadness in his eyes – he doesn’t normally look like that. Vlad is a very capable and skilled athlete and he was also carrying with him the memory of fellow athletes and Olympians who have lost their lives. I really appreciate his bravery. After being banned, he posted a picture on social media of the helmet with the caption: ‘This is the price of our dignity.’ I think that’s a very powerful, well-written, direct message.It was the incorrect decision for the IOC to take away Heraskevych’s accreditation. It owes him an apology.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

ISU officials told the Guardian that meant a number of the French judge’s highest marks were effectively discounted in the final calculation.The reassurance comes as scrutiny focuses on the scoring submitted by the French judge on the nine-member panel. In the free dance, the judge awarded the French pair nearly eight points more than the American team – a margin large enough that, had that score been excluded, Chock and Bates would have moved into the gold medal position.Under current rules, teams have limited avenues to challenge results unless the ISU itself elects to review judging conduct. There has been no indication that such a review is forthcoming.The controversy has renewed debate about subjectivity in figure skating scoring. An online petition calling for the ISU and International Olympic Committee (IOC) to investigate the judgingapproached 15,000 signaturesby Friday afternoon, reflecting widespread unease among viewers and some within the sport.Chock and Bates have largely avoided direct criticism of the judging panel, instead emphasising their pride in their performance and gratitude for fan support. The Americans, who delivered what they described as the strongest skate of their careers, produced a season-best performance and finished with 224.39 points – fewer than two points behind the French champions’ season-high total of 225.82.“We felt like we delivered our absolute best performance that we could have,” Bates said. “It was our Olympic moment. It felt like a winning skate to us and that’s what we’re going to hold on to.”View image in fullscreenAmerican duo Evan Bates and Madison Chock produced a season-best performance in the Olympic ice dance final.Photograph: Yara Nardi/ReutersThe couple – who were unbeaten over the past three seasons in all but one competition, when they finished second to 2026 Olympic bronze medallists Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier of Canada – said they had not analysed the scoring in detail but acknowledged hearing about the petition circulating online.“It means a lot that people are voicing their opinions on our behalf,” Bates said.Chock said the wave of public support helped soften the disappointment of finishing second after years of chasing an individual Olympic medal. The silver medal completed a milestone achievement for the pair, who finally secured the Olympic ice dance medal that had eluded them in three previous Games, in addition to theirteam event gold medalsearlier in the week.Still, she warned that opaque judging outcomes risk damaging the sport’s connection with fans.“Any time the public is confused by results, it does a disservice to our sport,” Chock said. “People need to understand what they’re cheering for and feel confident in the sport they’re supporting.”The French victory also drew attention because the partnership is relatively new at the highest level of international competition. Fournier Beaudry switched national representation to France and made her international debut with Cizeron only last autumn, in the wake ofassault and abuse allegationsinvolving each of their former partners. The pair quickly established themselves as contenders by winning the European Championships earlier this season.The judging debate also revived memories of one of the sport’s most infamous Olympic controversies, when allegations of vote-trading at the 2002 Salt Lake City Games triggered investigations and eventually led to the awarding of duplicate gold medals in pairs skating. That scandal prompted the ISU to abandon the longstanding 6.0 system in favour of the current judging structure, which combines element-based technical scores with programme component marks evaluating performance quality, skating skills and choreography.Winter Olympics 2026: Heraskevych’s appeal rejected by Cas, Klæbo seals treble, GB drought goes on – liveRead moreWhile the newer system was designed to reduce the impact of individual judges, critics have long argued that it remains difficult for casual audiences to understand, reduces the sport to a jumping contest and still allows room for subjectivity.The latest dispute has amplified those concerns. Analysts noted that while five of the nine judges placed Chock and Bates ahead of the French team, the larger margin from the French judge ultimately shaped the final standings.The scoring debate has also centred on the performance details. Fournier Beaudry and Cizeron produced a technically strong programme but were perceived by some observers to have benefited despite visible errors, including a noticeable mistake during a twizzle sequence. Meanwhile, the Americans delivered a nearly flawless skate, intensifying questions about how component scores were evaluated.For Chock and Bates, however, the emotional toll of the Olympic schedule – which included four performances across team and individual events in less than a week – left little time to dwell on controversy.“We haven’t fully processed everything that’s happened,” Bates said. “It took all of our mental and physical energy just to stay locked in.” Chock echoed that sentiment, framing the Olympic experience as larger than a single result.“A medal is a medal,” she said. “The Olympic dream is something that lives inside you. That’s what drives you.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026US sportsWinter OlympicsFigure skatingUSA Olympic teamFrance Olympic teamnewsShareReuse this content"

It began in Seoul 1988 to raise awareness among athletes and young people about sexually transmitted disease prevention— a topic that shouldn’t cause embarrassment.”Fontana also shared a Instagram post by the Spanish figure skater Olivia Smart, in which she showed her followers condoms stamped with the yellow Lombardy Region logo. “I found them,” she says in the clip, which has gone viral. “They have everything you need.”There are plenty of other activities to keep athletes busy in the Olympic village, including a large gym, table football and air hockey games and even a piano.

The forecast 3C temperatures for the Calcutta Cup encounter may be cooler than in Kolkata – appropriately the venue for the T20 World Cup group fixture – but a white-hot contest inside a chilly Murrayfield can be absolutely guaranteed.Because this particular collision, the 144th since the sides first met at Raeburn Place in 1871, looks set to shape the Six Nations prospects of all involved. To say Scotland are under additional pressure following theirdefeat by Italy in round oneis to state the obvious. And England, too, will take the field knowing the time has come to demonstrate whether or not they are the real deal.Itoje calls for ‘bulletproof’ England approach to slay their Murrayfield ghostsRead moreWith 12 successive Test wins already banked, that might feel like a superfluous aspiration. But there is a difference between playing and winning at home and going away to places like Murrayfield on weekends like this. Particularly when there is a real crackle of expectancy in the malty Edinburgh air. English presumption has been exposed in the north before and history hangs heavier over this fixture than any other.So no matter that England, underSteve Borthwick, have already won in Wales, Italy, Argentina, the US and Japan. To date they have still to conquer any of the other hostile arenas that tend to sift the great sides from the merely good ones. Scotland may have a tendency to blow hot and cold but put a white shirt and a red rose in front of them in the Six Nations and rare is the day they fail to turn up.The mind spools back to 1990 and 2000 and 2024 and all the other examples of bagpipe-accompanied chaos when, for whatever reason, the visitors froze tactically when it mattered. England have won only two of the last eight meetings between the two nations and eventhe last edition at Allianz Stadiumwas a game Scotland would have won had Finn Russell brought his goal-kicking boots to south-west London.Quick GuideNo love lost: auld rivals meet twice on Valentine’s DayShowIt’s a Valentine’s Day special: Scotland and England meet in different sports 5,000 miles apart today:9.30am GMTScotland v England in Kolkata (cricket)4.40pmGMTScotland v England in Calcutta Cup (rugby union)The historyThe cricketers are meeting in the T20 World Cup at Eden Gardens in Kolkata, formerly known as Calcutta – the very Indian city where, in 1878, British expats in the process of disbanding their local rugby club melted down their last 270 silver rupees to form a trophy that they gifted to the RFU. The Calcutta Cup has since been awarded to the winners of the England v Scotland men's rugby international, played annually as part of the Six Nations.The contestsScotland arrive at both matches on the back of an instructive game against Italy. the rugby men fell to a dispiriting 18-15 defeat in Rome last Saturday, while the cricketers beat the Italians by 73 runs on Monday in a match that went to form. England are favourites in both contests today but nothing is certain – their cricketers were taken to the last ball by Nepal and lost to the West Indies, while their rugby union team have lost on their last two trips to Edinburgh.The Valentine’s factorThere’s no love lost when these nations meet, though they have never faced each other in cricket or rugby on 14 February. There is football history on this date though – the Scottish FA’s centenary match in 1973. Bobby Moore captained England in a 5-0 Hampden win over a side featuring Kenny Dalglish and George Graham, skippered by Billy Bremner. Warning: love may be tested in households where watching cricket all morning and rugby for most of the afternoon is not seen as the optimal Valentine’s Day by both partners.The outcomeIn both instances a Scotland win would serve the tournament better – the Six Nations desperately needs a revitalised Scottish team, while a theme of cricket’s expansive T20 World Cup is the growth of the associate nations. But with Phil Salt opening England’s batting in Kolkata and Guy Pepper in the English pack at Murrayfield, there is an outcome that would give extra flavour to a day of sporting coincidences: double England glory ... led by Salt and Pepper.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The tartan tide has to turn at some point, though, and this might be that moment, for a couple of reasons. The first is that England are in a more stable, confident mood than for a good while. AdmittedlyWales last weekwas not a match upon which to base many sweeping conclusions, so poor were the visitors in the first 40 minutes, but this is no longer an English side that shrinks in adversity.George Ford at fly-half has brought a level of control and order that is increasingly enabling England to navigate their way out of tricky corners and they have ceased to be a team routinely edged out in the final quarter. A 6-2 forward-dominated bench split means Borthwick’s team now keep on coming and the pace of Ben Earl and Henry Pollock asks further questions of defenders once the game breaks up.Which leads us to the second underlying reason why England are becoming a different proposition to the teams previously eaten alive in Edinburgh: a sizeable chunk of the squad are totally unscarred by past Murrayfield maulings. Just eight of the starting lineup and 10 of the matchday 23 were involved two years ago whena Duhan van der Merwe hat-trickpropelled the hosts to a 30-21 victory.For good, sharp younger players such as Pollock, Guy Pepper, Henry Arundell and Alex Coles there is, instead, a greater sense of possibility and opportunity. It is four years now since Arundell, playing for England Under-20s in Edinburgh, scored a scorching length-of-the-field try that announced him as something special. His hat-trick against Wales last Saturday is unlikely to be the only time he crosses the try-line in this season’s championship.So when Borthwick talks about England embracing the occasion for what it is, rather than anticipating ghosts around every corner, it is not by chance. It is less about portraying Murrayfield as just another stretch of grass with goalposts at either end as embedding the mindset that this upwardly mobile England squad can become the Martini men – anytime, any place, anywhere – of world rugby.View image in fullscreenDuhan van der Merwe scored a hat-trick against England in 2024 but has been left out this time around.Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty ImagesIt makes the first 20 minutes particularly fascinating. That was effectively Scotland’s undoing in Rome, with Gregor Townsend suggesting his team were also then ambushed by the atrocious weather that made the second half a game of water polo. Any repeat against a bright-eyed England side will deliver a similar result as Townsend has already spelt out. “I think the start of the game sets the tone of who we are,” he emphasised, while simultaneously cautioning against going full Braveheart without the necessary accuracy and deft execution to match.Those “smarts” were frequently lacking in Rome where it was Italy who craftily engineered space in the Scottish backfield, which Louis Lynagh exploited for theAzzurri’s first try. With a dry ball, though, Scotland still have the backs to cause problems with Russell no stranger to the challenge of wrongfooting England.Keeping Russell quiet and shutting down Scotland completely tends to be easier said than done but against Italy the Scots made precisely zero line breaks, a stat they cannot afford to replicate this time.The hosts will also have to eradicate the lineout problems which helped to destabilise them in round one and, in one or two cases, repay Townsend’s selectorial faith on the occasion of the head coach’s 100th Test in charge. Leaving out Van der Merwe, such a thorn in English sides in the past, is one thing but the absence of the tall, versatile Blair Kinghorn from the matchday 23 will quietly delight the visitors, whose aerial chasing game is now a conspicuous strength.What are the odds, furthermore, on the decisive dagger being applied by an Englishman with a Scottish bloodline? Tom Roebuck, Fin Smith, Fraser Dingwall, Pollock and Bevan Rodd were potentially all eligible for Scotland either through birth or parentage, with Arundell and Sam Underhill – who has a Scottish granny – also possessing some dark blue heritage.Either way, the former England captain Courtney Lawes has been wondering aloud in his Times column if Scotland’s unhealthy obsession with beating England is actually holding them back and advising them to think bigger. It simply adds more fuel to a passionate affair which will define both teams’ tournaments. Valentine’s Day massacre or not, a sweet Kolkata cup double for England is definitely doable.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026England rugby union teamScotland rugby union teamSteve BorthwickSix NationsRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But his happy association with Hull continued with a magnificent display from hisChelseaside, who ultimately sauntered into the next round of the FA Cup.Hull City 0-4 Chelsea: FA Cup fourth round – liveRead moreThere was much to admire about this performance. Three days removed from surrenderinga two-goal lead against Leeds, it felt as though there was a sniff of vulnerability about Chelsea going into this intriguing tie. The capacity home crowd clearly felt it too given the atmosphere pre-match – but Chelsea navigated the task perfectly.Rosenior rang the changes, making seven of them to his starting lineup: with one in particular taking centre stage. The tie could and perhaps should have been decided long before it actually was, with both Estêvão Willian and Liam Delap guilty of spurning glorious opportunities to put Chelsea ahead in the first half.Quick GuideParkinson savours another Wrexham milestoneShowPhil Parkinson wanted to savour the moment after guiding Wrexham into the FA Cup fifth round for the first time in 29 years.John Windass scored the winner as they edged a tight contest against their Championship promotion rivals Ipswich 1-0 at the Racecourse Ground.It was another notable victory for the ambitious Welsh side as their rise under the ownership of the Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney continues.Parkinson said: \"We spoke before the game about our chance to create a bit of history. We've done it and I'm so pleased because it was always going to be a tough game against a very good side.\"Every season in football is special and you've got to savour it. This season, with the challenge of being in the Championship and now an FA Cup run, we want to enjoy it, and tonight we certainly did.\"PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.But fortunately for the visitors, Pedro Neto was in a much more clinical mood. The Portuguese broke the deadlock with a marvellous long-range strike which proved to be the catalyst for Chelsea to assume control of proceedings and by full time, Rosenior’s men had four, with Neto scoring three of them for a superb hat-trick.That made for an ultimately straightforward evening’s work, and the FA Cup-shaped omens are good from here for Chelsea. They have faced Hull on three other occasions in this competition in the last decade and every single time, they have gone on to make the final. There is still work to do in that regard, but this was another huge tick for Rosenior.View image in fullscreenLiam Rosenior gestures towards his much-changed Chelsea team.Photograph: Andrew Kearns/CameraSport/Getty Images“We could have scored more but Hull are a good team and it was a difficult tie; I’m delighted with the performance,” he said. “This club [Hull] means a lot to me so it was nice to get a good reception from both sets of fans. The attitude of the lads was superb.”Hull showed plenty of spirit throughout, but the better chances always came Chelsea’s way. Estêvão should have broken the deadlock when he rounded Dillon Phillips before inexplicably shooting over, before Delap then had a similar horror moment in front of goal against his former club.He blocked a Phillips clearance which bounced off the crossbar, and Delap began to run away to celebrate thinking the ball had crossed the line. It hadn’t, and by the time he realised Hull’s defenders had responded to clear the danger.Delap had his head in his hands after that horror moment but he was hugely influential from there on out, with three assists. The first was for the opening goal as his pass teed up Neto to score from outside the box and give the visitors a deserved lead. Six minutes after the restart, it was two as Neto’s corner went directly in and through Phillips’s legs.View image in fullscreenEstêvão slots in Chelsea’s third goal.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersBy that stage, the work Hull had done in the opening half-hour had long since been forgotten. They were firmly in the contest in the early exchanges but it was difficult to argue with the final outcome, and their focus must now return to securing a return to the Premier League under Sergej Jakirovic, who left out several key players here with that goal in mind.“I think we deserved at least one goal but if we play like this we will be in a very good position in the Championship,” he said post-match. “Never surrender, maybe in the next games this can be a good example of how we should play.”Seven minutes after Neto’s second, the tie was put beyond doubt as a magnificent run from Delap teed up Estêvão to tap into an empty net, before Neto completed his hat-trick as Delap once again played the crucial pass for the striker to calmly convert past a helpless Phillips and put the seal on a fine night’s work for him and his teammates.There was plenty of endeavour to the end from Hull, and they almost claimed a consolation when Lewis Koumas struck a post in injury time. But this was Chelsea’s night, and another encouraging step forward for their new manager at a place he knows very well.Explore more on these topicsFA CupHull CityChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The former Juventus defender has had spells at Hajduk Split, Paok, Karabukspor, Galatasaray, Udinese, Verona and Marseille, as well as an 11-game stint with Lazio.The desire to bring in an interim will be interpreted as Spurs looking to keep the position open for Pochettino should their former manager indicate he is ready for an emotional reunion.

But the Argentinian could be available after the tournament and has flirted with the idea of resuming his relationship with Spurs on multiple occasions. He remains a fan favourite and had his name chanted during Frank’s final game – the2-1 home defeat by Newcastleon Tuesday. It seems that Pochettino managing Chelsea during the 2023-24 season will not be held against him by Spurs supporters.View image in fullscreenMauricio Pochettino will take charge of the USA at this summer’s World Cup.Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty ImagesThere are no guarantees and Spurs will need a shortlist. The desire to bring in an interim ruled out Roberto De Zerbi – the Italian wants a break after leaving Marseille this week – but the former Brighton manager will be a candidate this summer. Spurs have also been linked with Bournemouth’s Andoni Iraola, Crystal Palace’s Oliver Glasner and Fulham’s Marco Silva.Tudor will have a shot at earning the job on a permanent basis if he proves a success. The 47-year-old’s task is to lift Spurs away from danger. They are five points above the bottom three before they host Arsenal in Tudor’s first game next Sunday. The first-team squad have been given until Monday off, with Spurs not in action this weekend after theirFA Cup exitlast month, but their new manager will be in place when they return.Spurs will hope that Tudor can lift the mood in the dressing room and calm the unrest in the stands. Frank struggled to win over supporters and players before leaving after eight months. The atmosphere at home games has been mutinous.ProfileIgor TudorShowPlaying daysAn imposing centre-back, Tudor broke through at hometown club Hajduk Split before joining Juventus in 1998. He spent nine years in Turin, winning two Serie A titles before returning to Hajduk. Tudor also won 55 Croatia caps, playing at the 1998 and 2006 World Cups and scoring against England at Euro 2004.Early managerial careerTudor's first managerial job came at Hajduk, winning the Croatian Cup in 2013. He lasted just nine months at Greek side Paok before being sacked due to \"unsuccessful results and criticism of the team\". After a year at Karabukspor, Tudor moved to Galatasaray but was sacked after 10 months, having struggled in Europe and fallen out with star player Wesley Sneijder.Return to ItalyTudor was named head coach of Udinese in April 2018 and saved the club from relegation. He left in the summer, but returned to Friuli in March 2019.  Tudor rejoined Hadjuk in January 2020 but after just eight months he was back in Italy, joining Juventus as Andrea Pirlo's assistant. The pair won the 2021 Coppa Italia but failed to regain the title and were dismissed. \"I think it was unfair,\" Tudor said. \"I've decided I will no longer work as an assistant for anybody else.\"Season in Verona and Marseille moveTudor was hired by Verona in September 2021 after they started the season with three league defeats. He improved things quickly, guiding them to a ninth-placed finish – but again leaving at the end of the season. Tudor's next job came at Marseille, where he replaced Jorge Sampaoli. The team finished third in Ligue 1 but flopped in the Champions League, losing twice to Tottenham. He announced his exit in June after \"a great year\", saying he was \"tired\" of managing Marseille.Lazio stint and return to JuventusTudor waited nine months for his next job, which came at Lazio after Maurizio Sarri resigned. After winning six of his 11 games in charge and sealing a Europa League spot, Tudor walked away after reported disputes with the club hierarchy over transfer targets. Having previously been linked with a return to Juventus, Tudor replaced Thiago Motta in March 2025, guiding the club to fourth place. He signed a contract extension until 2028, but was sacked in October after an eight-game winless run.Guardian sportWin percentages by clubHadjuk Split(first stint) 44.9%Paok37.78%Karabukspor38.1%Galatasaray55.9%Udinese(combined) 42.3%Hadjuk Split(second stint) 50.0%Verona38.9%Marseille56.3%Lazio54.6%Juventus41.7%Photograph: Jamie, Mcdonald/02 ALLSPORT UKWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Tudor will have to deal with a huge injury list. Frank, who left after a run of two wins from 17 league games, could not call upon the injured James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski this season. Mohammed Kudus and Richarlison are other notable absentees in attack and Wilson Odobert sustained a serious knee injury this week. Cristian Romero, the captain, hasspoken out against the Spurs hierarchyand is serving a four-game ban after his red card during last weekend’s 2-0 defeat at Manchester United.Discussions with Tudor moved swiftly. It is understood that Terzic, who has interest from La Liga for the summer, is keen to find a permanent role. Robbie Keane, the former Spurs striker, was not prepared to leave his role as the Ferencvaros manager to take a caretaker job.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurMauricio PochettinoUS sportsUSAnewsShareReuse this content"

Liverpool’s central-defensive rebuild is under way with the signings of Giovanni Leoniand Jérémy Jacquet, for an initial £26m and £55m respectively, but Slot insists Konaté remains an essential part of his plans.FA Cup fourth round: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead more“It’s just as good from him as from Virgil [van Dijk],” said Liverpool’s head coach of Konaté’s current form. “Ibou has had a very good spell recently. He had a lot of good games earlier in the season but then he was also part of the reason why we conceded a goal.“His general performances were good but then a small mistake he made immediately led to a goal and so he was judged differently. But he is having a very good partnership with Virgil since I’ve been here and, just like Virgil, he has always been fit. Touch wood. These two are vital for us, not only because of the quality they have but because of the lack of options we have behind.”Afterscoring the winner at Sunderlandon Wednesday, Van Dijk said he wanted Liverpool to secure his defensive colleague on a new contract. Konaté’s current deal expires at the end of the season and the 26-year-old has been linked with a free transfer to Real Madrid.Liverpool have been trying to secure the France international’sfuture for more than 12 months but, despite failing to agree fresh terms, Slot claimed the club are not resigned to Konate’s exit.“We are in talks with him so that tells you what we want,” said the Dutchman. “It’s clear we would like him to stay but negotiations are ongoing so let’s see where that ends. We wouldn’t be in negotiations if we didn’t want him to stay.”Meanwhile, Slot believes Mohamed Salah should be judged at the end of the season having struggled by his phenomenal standards in front of goal. Salah has scored only once since his return from the Africa Cup of Nations – though his assists and pressing stats have improved after the tournament – and across the entire campaign he is having fewer shots per game than previous years.“There could be multiple reasons for that,” said Slot. “It could be the opponent is even more aware of his threat after such a great season last season, or having so many different right-backs behind him for the whole season has influenced that dynamic. I could come up with five or six more reasons.“What I do see is that, in general, the team generates just as many chances as we did last season. The team has the most ball possession in the league. I also see us being able to bring our forwards, and not only Mo, into very promising positions in many games. So it will be a combination of factors. Even last season Mo had a period where he scored seven in four games, I think, and then five or six games where he didn’t score, so let’s see where he is at the end of the season when it comes to goals and assists.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotnewsShareReuse this content"

It will take more than a couple of teetering performances to set this team’s morale atremble. So despite beingnervy against Nepalandwobbly against West Indies, England could hardly have been more cocksure on the eve of a crucial T20 World Cup group fixture against Scotland. As Phil Salt put it: “When we’re at our best nobody can live with us.”England arrived in India having lost once in 11Twenty20games over the previous 12 months, and that run continues to be a source of belief. “It’s just about getting to that space more often than we have in the last two games,” Salt said. “We’re not talking about 10 [bad] games or 12 games, we’re talking about two games where it’s fair to say we haven’t been at our best. But the good news is the competition is in front of us and we’ve got these opportunities to come. And if we can be that authentic side of ourselves – chests out, taking the game on and being smart – there’s nothing to stop us.England left with no margin for error after defeat by West Indies at T20 World CupRead more“It’s about playing with personality going forwards. Being authentic to yourself and how you play the game. I think if we do that from one to 11 we’ll be in a great position. We had a really good lead-in to the tournament. We’ve played well as a unit for a good while, so it’s just about staying true to yourself as an individual and taking the game on as best you can, in smart ways.”In 2023, after England fell 2-0 behind in the Ashes with three to play, Ben Stokes described the situation as “actually very exciting” and insisted “the way we play our cricket couldn’t be more perfect for the situation we find ourselves in”. Two and a half years later, on a different continent and in a different format, the message in adversity is strikingly similar.“The exciting thing for everyone in our camp is that the opportunity is in front of us now, to prove that we can do it, to prove that when our backs are against the wall we can come out and we can play,” said Salt. “The opportunities are there to go out and play with some personality, express yourself. Because when we do that, sides can’t live with us. We know that much. It’s about bringing it to that night, and in that moment when you’ve got a decision to make taking the positive option with your chest out and put your stamp on the game. If we want to go deep into this World Cup, we’re going to have to do exactly that.”Scotland have been in Kolkata since they arrived in the country and have the advantage of playing a third straight game at Eden Gardens, having lost to West Indies and beaten Italy. But Salt is no stranger to this ground either. Hewon the Indian Premier League with Kolkata Knight Ridersin 2024 and has a superb record here: nine innings, five half-centuries, and an average of 50.75 at a strike rate of 182.06. (His career average in T20s is 28.12.)“We’ve got a lot of guys through the dressing room who have played a lot of cricket here, but if guys want to talk to me about Eden Gardens I’ll happily do that,” he said. “We’ve a few guys on our coaching staff and a lot of our players have also had success here.”Quick GuideEngland v Scotland teamsShowEngland (confirmed): Phil Salt, Jos Buttler (wk), Jacob Bethell, Tom Banton, Harry Brook (c), Sam Curran, Will Jacks, Liam Dawson, Jamie Overton, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid.Scotland (possible): George Munsey, Michaael Jones, Brandon McMullen, Richie Berrington (c), Tom Bruce, Michael Leask, Matthew Cross (wk), Mark Watt, Oliver Davidson, Brad Wheal, Brad Currie.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.In their infinite wisdom on the night before England play Scotland in what should become these historic sporting rivals’ first completed game of cricket since 2018 and only their fifth of all time, the two sides chose to give media duties to Salt (born in Wales, raised in Barbados) and Brad Wheal (born and raised in South Africa). Asked for his memories of meetings between the nations across the sporting sphere, Salt said: “You’ve asked the wrong person the question, it doesn’t mean loads to me.”He was, however, convinced that it means something to some other people. “I know a few of their lads quite well and I know they savour it a little bit more, playing against England. There’s a little bit more on it for them than other games,” Salt said. “An opportunity to upset England is most Scotsmen’s dream.”Quick GuideNo love lost: auld rivals meet twice on Valentine’s DayShowIt’s a Valentine’s Day special: Scotland and England meet in different sports 5,000 miles apart today:9.30am GMTScotland v England in Kolkata (cricket)4.40pmGMTScotland v England in Calcutta Cup (rugby union)The historyThe cricketers are meeting in the T20 World Cup at Eden Gardens in Kolkata, formerly known as Calcutta – the very Indian city where, in 1878, British expats in the process of disbanding their local rugby club melted down their last 270 silver rupees to form a trophy that they gifted to the RFU. The Calcutta Cup has since been awarded to the winners of the England v Scotland men's rugby international, played annually as part of the Six Nations.The contestsScotland arrive at both matches on the back of an instructive game against Italy. the rugby men fell to a dispiriting 18-15 defeat in Rome last Saturday, while the cricketers beat the Italians by 73 runs on Monday in a match that went to form. England are favourites in both contests today but nothing is certain – their cricketers were taken to the last ball by Nepal and lost to the West Indies, while their rugby union team have lost on their last two trips to Edinburgh.The Valentine’s factorThere’s no love lost when these nations meet, though they have never faced each other in cricket or rugby on 14 February. There is football history on this date though – the Scottish FA’s centenary match in 1973. Bobby Moore captained England in a 5-0 Hampden win over a side featuring Kenny Dalglish and George Graham, skippered by Billy Bremner. Warning: love may be tested in households where watching cricket all morning and rugby for most of the afternoon is not seen as the optimal Valentine’s Day by both partners.The outcomeIn both instances a Scotland win would serve the tournament better – the Six Nations desperately needs a revitalised Scottish team, while a theme of cricket’s expansive T20 World Cup is the growth of the associate nations. But with Phil Salt opening England’s batting in Kolkata and Guy Pepper in the English pack at Murrayfield, there is an outcome that would give extra flavour to a day of sporting coincidences: double England glory ... led by Salt and Pepper.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.There are, however, exceptions. “I think we approach this game as we do any other game,” said Scotland’s Wheal. “Obviously we realise that it’s a very important game. We’ve just got to take this head-on and be really brave. We play cricket as we always do, and we’re going to be brave and fight the best we can. Obviously the opponents are who they are but we take each game exactly the same. Obviously we understand it’s a massive rivalry in all sports, but at the end of the day it’s a game of cricket and we’re going to go out there and give it everything we’ve got.”Explore more on these topicsT20 World Cup 2026England cricket teamScotland Cricket TeamT20 World CupTwenty20CricketnewsShareReuse this content"

But all around the world the problem that we have [is that] we treat immigrants or people who come from other countries as the problem that our countries have, and it is a big problem as it not their fault.“The fact that I am a Catalan and you are British – what influence did we have on where we were born? It was mum and dad. Everybody wants to have a better life and a perspective to have a better future for themselves, their families and their friends, and sometimes opportunities come in the place where you are born and the place that maybe you go to.“Before it was so difficult to travel but today in one hour you can be everywhere. Today the colour of the skin or where you were born doesn’t make a difference. We have a lot of work to do about that. It doesn’t make me feel that because I am Catalan I am better than you.”Guardiola went on to reference a career that, as a player, took him from Barcelona to Brescia, Roma, Al Ahli, and Dorados in Mexico, before managerial roles in Spain, Germany and England. “My education when I was born and travelled in Mexico and Qatar or lived in Italy or England or Germany, that is just the benefit [for] my personality,” said the 55-year-old. “I met incredibly nice people travelling and that is what it is about. But it doesn’t make me feel better just for the fact I was born in one place or the other one.“Most people are running away from countries because of problems in their countries, not because they want to leave. When we embrace other cultures – truly embrace them – we will have a better society.”Guardiola pointed to how City’s dressing room has and continues to benefit from a blend of different cultures. “Absolutely. How nice it is to have Christian people, other people who are Muslim and they love each other, respect each other, work with each other,” he said. “What is the problem? The problem is created by the bosses and the presidents. If you have to rely on them, we are in trouble. Civilisation we have to do ourselves. We have to rely on guys to say what we have to do, to fight?”View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola says having a diverse dressing room helps Manchester City.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPACity host Salford City in Saturday’s FA Cup fourth round. Erling Haaland is an injury doubt for the game having been replaced at half-time of Wednesday’s3-0 win over Fulham.“He’s not 100% but we will see later how he feels,” said Guardiola. “It’s not a big issue, the doctors said to me, but he had some disturbances during the game and that’s why he didn’t play in the second half.”Guardiola has twice led City to FA Cup glory and said he loves the competition. “Playing against League One or League Two teams – that experience, when you arrive at the stadium with the coach and all the opposition fans there, chanting: ‘Who are you? Who are you?’ And you say: ‘Oh gosh.’ These kind of things, the vibes and long balls, other things. Honestly, I promise you, it will be one of the memories I will take for the rest of my life.”Meanwhile, Rodri has been charged with misconduct by the Football Association over his questioning of the neutrality of the referee Robert Jones after he allowed Dominic Solanke’s first goal inCity’s 2-2 draw at Tottenhamthis month.Solanke appeared to kick Marc Guéhi in the action for his finish on 53 minutes. “I know we won too much and the people don’t want us to win, but the referee has to be neutral,”said Rodri after the game. “It’s not fair because we work so hard. When everything is finished, you are frustrated.”In a statement, the FA said: “It’s alleged that the midfielder acted in an improper manner during a post-match media interview by making comments that imply bias and/or question the integrity of a match official and/or match officials, contrary to FA Rule 3.1. Rodri has until Wednesday 18 February to provide a response.”Explore more on these topicsManchester CityPep GuardiolaJim RatcliffenewsShareReuse this content"

It culminated inplayer strikesand the Canadian Soccer Players Associationfiling a $40m lawsuitagainst Canada Soccer board members two years ago.The CSB deal was heavily criticised during a 2023 parliamentary inquiry into Canada Soccer, as the federation was only receiving around $3m each year from its commercial and broadcast deals, which severely affected funding for Canada’s national teams.Moving the Goalposts | ‘Everything is at stake’: the fight for equal pay in Canadian footballRead moreCanada’s men’s teamboycotted a friendly against Panama in 2022as they demanded a greater share of World Cup prize money, more travel benefits and equitable match fees with the women’s national team, who in recent years have been far more successful.Canada’s women’s team also struggled for funding under the previous deal, and there was a national outcry when only 20 players were invited to a training camp in preparation for the 2023 SheBelieves Cup, less than two years after they won gold at the Tokyo Olympics. The women’s team also threatened to strike, but the action was ultimately called off.Under the terms of the previous deal Canada Soccer was due to receive around $3.4m from the CBS partnership in the World Cup year, but that figure is understood to have increased significantly and a new revenue-sharing model has been introduced.In a new broadcasting deal there is a commitment to ensure that all international matches in Canada and “Canada-friendly time zones” are televised live, as well as ensuring an equity of exposure between the men’s and women’s national teams. Both parties have also agreed to review the terms every three years to ensure they continue to receive fair market value.CSB has also been rebranded as Canadian Soccer Media and Entertainment (CSME) under the leadership of James Johnson, former chief executive of Football Australia, who has negotiated the new deal with Canada Soccer’s chief executive, Kevin Blue.“We are pleased to have amended this partnership into a new structure that is significantly more favourable to Canada Soccer, creating a clear pathway for commercial and financial success – especially in future years as opportunity in our sport continues to increase,” Blue said. “We are eager to move forward in a new era of alignment with CSME and continue to be sharply focused on growing all parts of our sport at this critical time.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaCanada women's football teamnewsShareReuse this content"

The boys were open and honest around the fact that we didn’t put ourselves on the game. We felt we played into England’s hands a little bit and obviously the discipline was hugely disappointing. It’s a massive lesson for us. It’s something we need to correct and put more of our game out on the field on Sunday.”Wales’s wretched run of form has brought only two wins in their past 24 Tests, both against Japan. But speaking on Thursday, the France coach, Fabien Galthié, was keen to ensure his team don’t take the hosts lightly in Cardiff.“For me [it is] the most beautiful stadium in the world, with those Welsh chants that never stop,” he said. “It’s special and, in my opinion, it levels the playing field. It gives the Welsh an extra spark.”Before that, Ireland host Italy on Saturday and their captain, Caelan Doris, has said they cannot afford to have any “passengers” and urged teammates to take greater individual responsibility. Andy Farrell’s side are under pressure to produce a performance in Dublin against theAzzurriin the wake ofa dispiriting round-one defeataway to the reigning champions, France.Farrell, the head coach, has made six changes to his starting XV, including handing championship debuts to the flanker Cormac Izuchukwu and the wing Robert Baloucoune and naming the uncapped lock Edwin Edogbo on the bench.View image in fullscreenCaelen Doris during the Ireland team run in Dublin on Friday.Photograph: Brian Lawless/PADoris, who switches from No 8 to openside flanker, said: “It’s an exciting team we’ve got. There’s obviously a few changes, so getting cohesion through the week has been important. The message to those guys [coming into the team] is to trust themselves.“Same with all of us really off the back of a defeat like that; doubling down on what we’re good at, doing things properly with intent, enjoying it and enjoying it from doing things properly with intent as well. Creating a feeling through how we show up with actions, and it can be infectious that. But also to the new guys it’s making sure they own it and make it feel like it’s properly theirs. You can’t have any passengers tomorrow, so, yeah, full ownership from everyone.”Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026Six NationsWales rugby union teamFrance rugby union teamIreland rugby union teamItaly rugby union teamRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The scheduled seven-race card at the Lancashire course includes two Grade Two events in addition to the £100,000 Grand National Trial over three-and-a-half miles.No inspection is currently planned at Musselburgh for the track’s card on Sunday, but a six-race meeting at Lingfield on Monday was called off early on Friday afternoon with the track already waterlogged and further rain expected.Conditions will be very different in Riyadh on Saturday evening when Forever Young, the Breeders’ Cup Classic winner, could take his career earnings past $30m (£22m) with a second successive victory in the $20m Saudi Cup, the world’s richest race.Forever Young, trained in Japan by Yoshito Yahagi, will set off as a warm favourite to beat a field that includes Bob Baffert’s Nysos, the Breeders’ Cup Dirt Mile winner in 2025, and his stable-companion Nevada Beach, who was a head behind him in a Grade Two event at Santa Anita in December.Oisin Murphy, Britain’s champion jockey, also has a ride in the race aboard Sunrise Zipangu, whose trainer, Kyoko Maekawa, was the first woman to be granted a training licence in Japan.View image in fullscreenRyusei Sakai (No 5) rode Forever Young to victory in the 2025 Breeders’ Cup Classic.Photograph: Gregory Bull/APPic D’Orhy can be Jonbon’s bogeyThe popular and supremely consistent Jonbon would become only the third horse this century to win 11 Grade One races over jumps with victory in the Ascot Chase on Saturdaythis afternoon, butPic D’Orhy(3.35), his main market rival, is also on the brink of a significant achievement and could be the better bet at a track and trip that suits him ideally.The 11-year-old will join eight former residents of the Paul Nicholls stable as the winner of more than £1m in prize money if he finishes either first or second in the five-runner field, which is all the more impressive given a preference for right-handed tracks which has seen him make only one appearance at Cheltenham, in March 2019.Pic D’Orhy needs to be forgiven a lacklustre run in the 1965 Chase over Saturday’s course and distance in November, but he has always appreciated a decent break between runs and that outing came just three weeks after a promising seasonal reappearance in the Charlie Hall at Wetherby.Saturday’s race will be his first for 84 days, and in an event that he has won for the past two seasons having set off on both occasions as the second-pick in the betting. The Nicholls stable is also in much better form in recent weeks, with 11 wins from 27 runners before racing on Friday including Tutti Quanti’s emphatic win in last weekend’s feature event.Jonbon, admittedly, promises to be a tougher opponent than either of the last two favourites, but he is racing beyond two-and-a-half miles for the first time and also had to dig deep to win the Clarence House at Ascot four weeks ago after looking beaten two out.Ascot 1.15:Mondoui’boywas a six-figure recruit to the Ben Pauling stable last summer, made a smooth transition to hurdling at Ludlow last month and will be strongly fancied to follow up here.Wincanton 1.35:The Kingwell Hurdle was won by the subsequent Champion Hurdle winner for the first time since 2008 last season, and fast-improvingAlexei, a close third under 12 stone in a hot handicap at Ascot last time, can book a place in this year’s Champion field with a third success of the campaign.Ascot 1.50:The late scratch of likely favourite Thomas Mor should leaveThe Jukebox Kidwith a straightforward task.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Saturday tipsShowWincanton:12.35 Eton Mes 1.05 Bluey 1.35 Alexei 2.11 Caballero Cliff 2.50 Mutley Crew 3.23 Jack Black 4.00 Cooleenymore 4.37 Call Me Legend.Lingfield:12.50 Voix De Bocelli 1.25 Into The Light 2.00 McLoven 2.35 Union Island 3.10 Legal Reform 3.45 Prancy Peer 4.20 Combustion.Haydock:12.55 Pourquoi Pas Papa 1.28 Throatlash 2.05 Kabral Du Mathan 2.40 Ubatuba (nb) 3.15 Deafening Silence 3.50 Found A Diamon 4.30 Unexpected Party.Ascot:1.15 Mondoui’Boy 1.50 The Jukebox Kid 2.25 Range (nap) 3.00 Montregard 3.35 Pic D’Orhy 4.10 Top Guy 4.45 The Flaggy Shore.Newcastle:4.25 Golspie 4.55 Pit Boss 5.25 Ruby Red Gove 5.55 Francesi 6.25 Mystical Land 6.55 Party Bear 7.25 Silver State.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Haydock 2.05:Dan Skelton’sKabral Du Mathanimproves with every step up in trip and will be a short price to complete a hat-trick.Ascot 2.25:The form ofRange’s narrow success at Sandown in January was franked when the runner-up took a strong race next time, and first-time cheekpieces could also eke out some more improvement.Haydock 2.40:Ubatubahas won both his starts over hurdles with ease and can add to this on the way to a possible tilt at the Albert Bartlett at Cheltenham.Ascot 3.00:A positive track-and-trip record suggestsMontregardcould be the answer here despite racing from 3lb out of the handicap.Haydock 3.15:With just seven races over fences in the book,Deafening Silencehas obvious scope to build on a fine third place in the Welsh Grand National in December.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingHorse racing tipsnewsShareReuse this content"

At first he appeared to suggest that he wanted to intervene – telling people protesting against the country’s regime that “help is coming”. But at the time the US had few military assets available.That changed with the arrival of the Lincoln carrier strike group, but by then the Iranian regime had largely regained control of the streets by killing thousands of people – possibly tens of thousands – in the most brutal crackdown in the country’s recent history.Meanwhile, the US president’s focus appeared to have moved to curbing Iran’s nuclear programme – already set back in a summer bombing campaign by Israeli and US air forces during last summer’s 12-day war.The Ford carrier strike group had been sent from the eastern Mediterranean at the end of October, and arrived in the Caribbean Sea in mid-November as Trump increased pressure on Venezeula’s former president Nicolás Maduro.It played a central role in the extraordinary seizure of Maduro by US forces in early January, and had remained in the Caribbean. However, sending the carrier and its allied warships back to the Middle East makes for an unusually long deployment: it left the US in June 2025 and has no obvious date of return.On Thursday Trump warned Iran that failure to reach a deal with his administration would be “very traumatic” and said he hoped that talks would conclude shortly.“I guess over the next month, something like that,” Trump said in response to a question about his timeline for striking a deal with Iran on its nuclear programme. “It should happen quickly. They should agree very quickly.”Then, on Friday, on a visit to the Fort Bragg military base in North Carolina, Trump said a change of government in Iran would be the “best thing that could happen”.“For 47 years, they’ve been talking and talking and talking. In the meantime, we’ve lost a lot of lives while they talk,” he told reporters.Explore more on these topicsIranDonald TrumpUS militaryUS foreign policyIran nuclear programmeMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

The new legislation will extend that prohibition to the use of vapes and heated tobacco.“No child in a playground or hospital patient should suffer because someone else chooses to smoke,” said Wes Streeting, the health secretary.“Secondhand smoke increases the risk of heart disease and lung cancer and we want to protect children and the sick from harm.”The Department ofHealthand Social Care said that the measures it is proposing are needed to protect health given the growing evidence about the dangers of heated tobacco and vaping.It said: “Evidence is emerging that emissions from heated tobacco and secondhand vapour from vapes pose health risks. At the same time, youth vaping has risen sharply in recent years, raising concerns about nicotine addiction and long-term health effects.”The bill does not include a ban on smoking outside pubs. It also exempts smoking or vaping in care homes, hospices, mental health hospitals and residential schools.The measures are subject to the outcome of a public consultation, which launched on Friday and will run for 12 weeks until 8 May.The health campaign charity Action on Smoking and Health said ministers were right to explore the possibility of outlawing vaping in cars carrying under-18s.Caroline Cerny, ASH’s deputy chief executive, said: “This consultation, and the wider legislation it is part of, is focused on protecting children. Although exposure to secondhand vapour is significantly less harmful than secondhand smoke, it is reasonable to consider whether steps should be taken to minimise any potential risk – particularly in small, enclosed spaces such as cars where children are present.“A balance needs to be struck in these regulations between protecting children and ensuring adults who smoke are still supported to switch to vapes. The consultation process should help the government strike that balance.”Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, said: “People who do not smoke but who are exposed to secondhand smoke can suffer significant harmful effects on their health, including an increased risk of asthma, poor birth outcomes, several cancers, stroke and heart disease.”Explore more on these topicsSmokingVapingTobacco industryHealthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

But he was wrong, and he will face justice. Our message to all nefarious foreign actors should be clear: steer clear of the United States and our people.”US accuses Indian agent of directing plot to assassinate American citizenRead moreJames Barnacle, the FBI assistant director in charge, added that Gupta had worked “at the direction and coordination of an Indian government employee”.Pannun, who serves as a lawyer at a New York-based group called Sikhs for Justice, said in a statement that the guilty plea was “judicial confirmation” that the Indian government of Narendra Modi orchestrated an assassination plot on American soil.“The Indian government targeted an American citizen for exercising first amendment rights – organizing the Khalistan referendum, a peaceful political campaign advocating self-determination for Punjab … The Modi government’s transnational assassination plots to silence dissenting political opinion is an act of terrorism and attack on America’s sovereignty,” he said.The news marks a stunning development in a case that began in June 2023, when another high-profile Sikh activist named Hardeep Singh Nijjar wasshot deadoutside a Sikh temple in British Columbia, Canada. Justin Trudeau, who served as Canada’s prime minister at the time, said months after the murder that there were“credible allegations”that agents of the Indian government had carried out the killing.India called the accusation “absurd” and politically motivated. But Trudeau’s allegation gained credibility in November that year, when the US attorney’s office in New York unsealed an indictment against Gupta, and announced he was being extradited back to the US from the Czech Republic.Gupta was described at the time as an Indian national who resided in India and was an associate of an Indian government official – later identified as Vikash Yadav – who had recruited Gupta to orchestrate the assassination of Pannun, an American citizen, on US soil.Yadav was alsoindicted but remains at largeand is a subject of a federal arrest warrant.US lawyer allegedly targeted in Indian murder plot still receiving death threatsRead moreWhen Gupta contacted an individual to carry out the murder, he believed he was contacting a criminal associate. In fact, the individual was a described as a confidential source working with the US Drug Enforcement Administration, US prosecutors said.India’s government has dissociated itself from any plot againstPannun, saying it was against government policy, according to Reuters.In his statement, Pannum said: “The Modi government’s claim that [the] murder-for-hire conspiracy was the act of a ‘rogue agent’ collapses under the weight of the evidence presented in federal court.”The news follows a significant development in US-India relations earlier this month, after Donald Trump claimed that India had agreed to stop buying Russian oil and that he agreed to cut US tariffs on India exports. In a post, Trump called the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, “one of my greatest friends”. US officials have said that there is no evidence that Modi was aware of the plot, the New York Times reported.Explore more on these topicsUS newsIndiaActivismNew YorkUS justice systemUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Staff numbers in that demographic fell from 3,632 to 2,936.The overall figures showed that almost 60% of staff that left agencies last year chose to resign.The IPA said 24% of agencies expected to cut jobs directly as a result of AI this year – a threefold increase on the number that did owing to the technology in 2025.There was a 41% decrease in advertised jobs across all levels of seniority in the industry last year, led by a reduction of almost half at creative agencies.Creative agencies are also giving up on graduate recruitment – as trainees, apprentices or school-leaver apprentices – with just 43% saying they took on any as employees last year. This is a considerable slump from the 56% reported in 2024.“These numbers confirm that the agency model is gasping for air,” said James Kirkham, the founder of the agency Iconic. “The mistake everyone is making is still treating AI like an efficiency play – shave a few numbers, strip some cost, reduce headcount to get the same output but with fewer people.”He added: “Death by a thousand cuts with a spreadsheet is not the transformation needed. The real, and only, move is proper creative coexistence. Agencies need to learn to co-create with AI, not outsource the process to these tools, and then they will find they can punch above their weight.”WPP, whichdropped out of the FTSE 100 last yearfor the first time in almost three decades as itstruggles to retain clients and catch up with the AI and data capabilities of rivals, is expected to announce sweeping changes to its creative agency operations later this month.The group, which has already scrapped prestigious agencies such as J Walter Thompson and Young & Rubicam, is to bring its three remaining ones – Ogilvy, VML and AKQA – together under the banner ofWPPCreative.After the publication of the IPA figures, Trent Patterson, the chief executive of Publicis London,turned to LinkedInto remind the ad sector that the French-headquartered groupcontinued to perform strongly compared with rivals.He said the IPA figures were a reminder of how challenging the market was for “many talented people at the moment”.“We’re fortunate to be in a moment of real momentum and we don’t take that for granted,” he added, in a post that contained information about a range of roles for which the London agency was hiring.Paul Bainsfair, the director general of the IPA, said the fall in staff numbers, the rate of staff turnover and the steep fall in entry-level roles “raises real questions about future capability, particularly as AI reshapes skills and ways of working”.Explore more on these topicsAdvertisingJob lossesAI (artificial intelligence)WPPnewsShareReuse this content"

It is worth underlining what the high court in London has todayruled to be unlawful: our government’s decision to place the direct-action group Palestine Action on the same legal footing as al-Qaida and Islamic State. Legally speaking, simply showing support for it risked a jail sentence of up to 14 years. The consequences? More than2,700 people arrestedfor holding placards opposing genocide and supporting Palestine Action, many of them elderly, including a retired octogenarian priest.No one who engages in criminal damage for a political cause imagines they will avoid arrest. As the court ruling makes clear, normal criminal law remains available for such acts. But when a government applies the badge of “terrorism” to movements that, however disorderly, are clearly not terrorist movements, an alarming precedent is set. As the court recognised, the proscription interferes with rights to freedom of expression, to peaceful assembly and free associations with others. You do not need a fevered imagination to see how a future Reform UK government could build on such a precedent. (As things stand, the ban on the group remains in effect so the government has time to appeal.)10:35Owen Jones on Palestine Action high court win | The LatestThe judges’ ruling did argue that Palestine Action’s adoption of direct action goes beyond civil disobedience. That’s because it seeks to damage property – primarily, to destroy equipment belonging to the Israeli arms manufacturerElbit Systems. Well, fine, but then the suffragettes weren’t a civil disobedience movement either. Today, they are secular saints, lauded by some of the same MPs who voted to proscribe Palestine Action, even though their tactics were far more extreme. Let’s not forget, the suffragettes planted bombs, burned down private homes and even killed people.History’s judgment on that movement is clear: the greater crime was the disenfranchisement of women. Their actions are seen through that prism.In this case, aUN independent commission, genocide scholars and NGOs ranging fromAmnesty Internationalto Médecins Sans Frontières have concluded that Israel has committed genocide against the Palestinian people. The international criminal court (ICC) – of which the UK is a founding member – long agoissued arrest warrantsfor Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former defence minister for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. Britain supplies crucial components for Israel’s fighter jets,shares intelligenceand permits itscitizens to fightin Israel’s army.In the abstract, how would a reasonable person respond if asked: “If you have strong grounds to conclude that your own government is facilitating genocide – the crime of crimes – should you do whatever it takes to stop it, even if that means breaking the law?” That is undoubtedly a question English juries have wrestled with, because they have repeatedly acquittedPalestine Actionactivists hauled before the court. No wonder the government wants to curb trial by jury.Our home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has declared that she will “fight” the judgment in the court of appeal. It is worth noting that according to his published correspondence with Peter Mandelson, Mahmood’s cabinet colleague Wes Streeting declared last year: “Israel is committing war crimes before our eyes.” Moreover, more than a decade ago, Mahmood was marching against an Israeli onslaught against Gaza which – however horrific – was not anywhere near the scale of the current genocide.It stretches incredulity to believe that Mahmood does not share Streeting’s conclusion that Israel has committed war crimes, because denying that is like subscribing to flat-Earthism. The British government refuses to state the obvious because that would impose legal obligations on it. For a start, it would not be lawful to supply the crucial components of fighter jets to a state committing war crimes. That’s why the thenforeign secretary backtrackedlast year when he described Israel’s blockade of Gaza as what it is: a violation of international law.In sum, smashing up the equipment of an Israeli arms manufacturer isn’t lawful – but neither is arming a state committing war crimes, and indeed genocide. Which should we treat as the most serious?Let’s be clear: if the Palestine Action hunger strikers die, the government will bear moral responsibility | George MonbiotRead moreThere is one major question to be answered. After Palestine Action vandalised Donald Trump’s Turnberry golf resort in Scotland in March 2025 – before the group was proscribed–the president described them as “terrorists” and expressed hope they would be “treated harshly”. We also know thatTrump discussedPalestine Action twice with our prime minister. The contents of that conversation must be revealed to establish whether proscription was discussed.That only 26 MPsvoted againstthis unlawful legislation tells you everything you need to know about our soulless, cowardly political establishment. But those who have facilitated genocide should begin to panic. The suffragettes, alas, did not have court rulings in their favour at the time, and their cause was – however absurdly – controversial. Women did not receive the vote in full until 1928, and the suffragettes’ canonisation came decades later.But polling shows that the British public believes Israel’s attack on Gaza wasnot justified, supports anarms embargoand sanctions against Israel, andsupports the arrestof Netanyahu. Polling in the US shows thathalf of Americansbelieve Israel has committed genocide, with just over a third disagreeing. That the ICC issued arrest warrants despite colossal western pressure is another sign of where this all leads.It is obvious that Israel’s genocide will be remembered as one of the great crimes of our age. Those complicit will be damned by history, and may one day find themselves hauled before the courts. Those who were arrested for holding placards will be vindicated as courageous fighters against the worst crime that can possibly exist. Whether Mahmood wins or loses her appeal, that reckoning is coming.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Working with the police might be a startFri 13 Feb 2026 07.45 ESTLast modified on Fri 13 Feb 2026 14.16 ESTShare“I could have worse tags than ‘Air Miles Andy’,” the then Prince Andrew once reflected. “Although I don’t know what they are!” I think it’s safe to say he does now.Almost all senior members of the royal family are biologically capable of sweating, and what really brought them out in a cold one four years ago was the thought of this honking liability testifying in a New York courtroom. So they paid millions upon millions to make sure it didn’t happen. The late Virginia Giuffre’s civil case alleging that the former prince abused her on three occasions in London, New York and the US Virgin Islands was never heard, because the late queen seems to have decided that it shouldn’t be at almost any cost. (Andrew denied all claims of wrongdoing.) And yet, as many of us predicted at the time, this would never be the end of it, and the royal family are now playing a failing game of catch-up with the institution’s own actions. Andrew’s de-princing – an attempt to keep it all in-house – already hasn’t worked.The Windsors are incredibly tight with their own money and have spent generations in arguments and internecine sulks about how it is spread around. Before the Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepped away from their roles, money rows were a big part of Harry’s but also William’s friction with their father, now king. The idea that this bunch would fork over areported $12m,plus seven figures of Andrew’s legal costs, without some fairly frank family discussions is just bollocks. Yet they clung to their public silence. They shielded him from what lesser mortals would know as the consequences of their alleged actions. This is proving to be extremely consequential for them.Whose were the millions? As of yesterday, the king is letting it be known via courtiers that hedidn’t chip in, with the money coming mostly from the late queen and the estate of the Duke of Edinburgh. It is often assumedthe late queenpaid from her secretive private funds, but others suggest it came from the Duchy of Lancaster, the earnings of which are public money. It would be good to know. In fact, it’s one of many Andrew-related questions that senior royals would surely have got the answer to behind closed doors many, many years ago. It would be good to know, for instance, how come in 2007 aKazakh oligarchpaid our former trade envoy £3m more than the asking price for a mansion the late queen had given Andrew as a wedding present – and an estimated £7m more than the market value – and then was happy to let it go to ruin. Please don’t tell me they never asked the question.This week, the Windsors’ approach to the gathering peril has shifted. Now, say Charles and William and Kate in statements issued on their behalf,the king and queen“stand ready to support [Thames Valley police] as you would expect”, whilethe Waleses“remain focused on the victims”.And yet, some victims are very specifically asking the royal family to focus on how they could help inmore active waysthan thoughts and prayers. It would, for instance, be a lot more helpful if they focused on security logs at Buckingham Palace and Balmoral, as well as internal household emails, and all the other documentation that could be dredged up. Aleaked emaillast year suggested that in 2011 Andrew had asked one of his taxpayer-funded royal protection officers to dig up dirt on Giuffre. The officer in question reportedly couldn’t remember the events in question, and the Met closed its investigation into the matter. Have police ever even so much as spoken to Andrew about any aspect of this case? We don’t know. We should.The general approach of the monarchy and the establishment or whatever you want to call it has always been to imply that no one knows whether Andrew, who had 24-hour top-level protection, was where he said he was at any given time. But every now and then, someone refuses to play ball. Take the late Thomas Harris, former British consul general in New York, with whom Andrew claimed to have been staying, meaning he couldn’t have had “activity” with Giuffre at Epstein’s Manhattan house.“It doesn’t sound like he stayed with me,”Harris stated in 2019, saying he had no recollection of the visit and it hadn’t featured in the Court Circular, which would have been standard. What a puzzle. One for Buckingham Palace’s remorselessly dogged internal affairs department, perhaps.Andrew himself spent years playing a two-faced game, suggesting to Emily Maitlis that he’d certainly help US investigators with their Epstein inquiries if asked. Yet soon after, the then US attorney for the southern district of New York stated for the record that Andrew had offered“zero” cooperationup till that point. A few months later, the situation remained unchanged. “If Prince Andrew is, in fact, serious about cooperating with the ongoing federal investigation,” the attorney declared, “our doors remain open, and we await word of when we should expect him.”The trouble comes when that two-faced game is perceived by the public to have spread to those at the top of the institution, who certainly have no part in alleged crimes, but have not dispelled the increasingly noxious impression of the institution having been adjacent to a cover-up.Statements this week indicate senior royals are still playing this dangerous game of publicly really, really wanting to help, while not revealing anything useful of substance. No doubt they think this is the only game they can play. They are not brilliant strategists – the royal family is, somewhat famously, not a meritocracy. They eventually worked out that doing nothing was not an option; I wonder how soon they’ll clock that doing a bit less than nothing isn’t either?Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

On Monday, the parliamentaryLabourparty reacted as it should when its leader hit a spot of bother. It knew it could not sack him, so it backed him. The constitution did its job and parliament supported the elected government of the day.The idea that what Britain most needs is a Downing Street conflict is madness. After a week of a truly almighty storm in a teacup, it was a relief that the Commons could recover and steady the ship of state. It should keep it that way into the immediate future.The cliche of the week was that the country stared into the abyss and drew back. If that was true, then Keir Starmer deserves a gold medal for hisperformance on Monday night. While he quietened the party mob, cooler heads were also calming the cabinet. A better cliche is that a week is a long time in politics. The storm has subsided, leaving disappointed commentators muttering: “It’s still not if, but when.”The reason for the prime minister’s troubles is by now well rehearsed. He appointed aman who he knew to have dodgy friendsto the Washington embassy and had to get rid of him. This is only one among Labour’s many U-turns, which also include on benefits for disabled people, the winter fuel allowance for pensioners, inheritance tax, pubs and the rest. Mandelson has gone and further investigations are a matter for the police.The reality was that this was exactly the sort of story Britain’s hot-house politics loves: a US president, a British royal, sexual abuse, misogyny and stupefying wealth. The papers could keep it bubbling with juicy facts day after day. The 24/7 media went crazy. It could forget boring government and its issues. Yes, of course the story at root involved a disgrace, but Westminster flicks a switch and turns disgrace into national scandal. All sense of proportion vanishes.Britain’s prime minister has been in power for less than two years. He has struggled with his central mission, which is to get the nation’s public finances into shape. He has not yet succeeded – but nor has he failed. There have been numerous mistakes. Starmer appointed a politically inept chancellor and failed to censor her£40bn tax rise. He had to move his foreign secretary, his home secretary and histop Downing Street teaminside a year. In the Commons he has suffered the well-known danger of a large majority, which is for it to become uncontrollable.These errors were proportionally far worse for his party and the country than was the Mandelson affair. Clearly a large number of Labour MPs feel Starmer’s qualities are not suited to the post. But then they chose him – as he chose Mandelson. They must have known his limitations.The primary public interest in the government just now is stability. The only conceivable virtue in a coup against Starmer is that it would bring in a regime stronger, more purposeful and more appealing to the electorate. None of the normally listed options passes that test. Wes Streeting has yet to prove himself a reformer of the NHS. Angela Rayner is hardly a unifier. Andy Burnham is not even in parliament.Plenty of prime ministers have survived attempts to topple them. They are surrounded by rivals who went into politics hoping they might end up in Downing Street. Gordon Brownfaced a leadership challenge from James Purnell.John Major had to resign as party leader mid-term and fight for re-election. Thatcher endured a long-running revolt from “wets” within her cabinet.Britain has been through a decade of chaos at the apex of its politics. Its economy has needed a steady hand, not one under constant insecurity and challenge. Abroad, the past year has been dominated by turbulent events in Washington and elsewhere. Starmer has performed throughout with dignity. He has held Britain’s customary position as intermediary between Europe and the US. There is no public interest in undermining him.Starmer’s next challenge will be the forthcomingGorton and Denton byelection, followed by the May local elections and the ongoing march of the Greens and Reform UK. His job is to rise above these crises, not succumb to them. Many Labour MPs are new and understandably fear for their seats. But they must know that unseating Starmer is unlikely to make them safer.The 2024 election was supposedly a relief after voters had lived through five prime ministers in a decade. Now to gamble on a sixth cannot make sense. The only winners would be the populist parties of the right and left, and the nationalist fringe.

Cue an authoritarian responseFri 13 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 13 Feb 2026 11.03 ESTShareIt must have seemed the easiest offer in the world to refuse. Would students at Bangor University enjoy a question-and-answer session with Sarah Pochin–the Reform UK MPfamous for sayingit “drives me mad” to see TV adverts full of black people – andJack Anderton, the 25-year-old influencer who helped send Nigel Farage’s TikTok account viral among teenagers? No, the university’s debating society decided, it would not.And had it filed the request in the bin, you wouldn’t be reading this. Until now, Anderton’s A New Dawn campus tour– a homage to the “debate me bro” style of the American rightwing activist Charlie Kirk,killed last year, who was famed for invitingliberal students to take on his arguments and live-streaming the results – hadn’t exactly set the heather alight. Reform is actively pushing to recruit inside universities, but in Cambridge, according to its student newspaper Varsity, only about 30 people turned up to hear Anderton argue that migrants are taking the part-time jobs students once used to do.The same was true in Exeter and York, according to their respective student papers Exposé and York Vision. And despite noisy counter-protests, the tour wasn’t juicing the kind of controversy that commands attention on YouTube, where the really big crowds are. (The Cambridge event livestream had a paltry 177 views when I checked.)So imagine how he must have felt when Bangor debating and politics society responded that “in line with our values” it was declining his offer, expressing “zero tolerance for any form of racism, transphobia or homophobia”.Finally, a proper no-platforming! (Though strictly speaking, he and Pochin were never actually given a platform of which to be stripped.) That’s worth more in terms of reach than trekking to Bangor on a wet February night to face a half-empty room. GB News and the Daily Telegraph weighed in. Reform’s Zia Yusufthundered on Xthat Bangor got £30m from taxpayers and he was “sure they won’t mind losing every penny of (their) state funding under a Reform government”. And that’s where it suddenly got serious.Threatening to put universities out of business – with all that would mean for students halfway through their degrees, or towns reliant on a major employer – if they don’t fawningly accommodate any regime-backed political nonentity who asks is the stuff of autocracy, not democracy. And the lesson from Donald Trump’s America, where pro-free speech Republicans have proved remarkably intolerant of people speaking against them, is that the pressure rarely stops there.What would stop the financial intimidation of a BBC reliant on the licence fee? What about charities and cultural or civic institutions receiving public grants, or newspapers with owners anxious to protect their other business interests, or schools? Though a Reform spokesperson later insisted Yusuf’s comments were “not party policy”, his literal job title is head of policy, and Reform has previously advocated removing at least some funding from universities that don’t protect free speech.Vice-chancellors have been criticised for quietlyseeking meetingswith Reform. But I’m not surprised they’re anxious to lobby a prospective prime minister who publicly accuses them of poisoning young people’s minds, and who they are told sees Trump’s crusade against “woke”Ivy League universitiesas a model.Academia is an obvious target for the populist right because it’s a classic wellspring of resistance: students are often first to the barricades and graduates are more likely to hold socially liberal views than people who left school at 18. But thefinancial crisisin England’s higher education system makes it unusually vulnerable to attack.Some smaller institutions have already been brought to the financial brink by government curbs on foreign students, who pay higher fees than British students and have for years helped universities balance the books. If a Reform government pursuing close to zero immigration cuts student visas, it wouldn’t take much to tip some over the edge. (Ironically, among those most at risk might be smaller post-1992 institutions, some perhaps in Reform’s new heartlands.) Others would be in no position financially to resist political pressure. When Trumpfroze millions of dollarsof research funding to universities that had rebuffed his demands over admissions and hiring policy, the teaching of conservative ideas and policing of campus protests, only the richest institutions could afford to fight back through the courts. And while UK law offers some protection for universities’ autonomy in research and teaching, laws can always be repealed.That priceless academic freedom to think and explore what you like is, of course, a two-way street. Students must be willing to hear views they don’t like and learn how to argue back, a skill that matters more than ever now and is more safely acquired arguing face-to-face on campus than on social media.Pubs are for everyone. Don’t let Reform make them the political property of the boorish hard right | Jonathan LiewRead moreBut the current crop of students is perhaps sturdier than popular myth would have you think. Recent research at the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) found69% of studentsfelt universities should never limit free speech, up from 60% in 2016. (Though admittedly Hepi also found a third favoured banning Reform speakers from campus and another 16% wanted Labour speakers banned, students showed a confusing tendency to advocate banning parties they had actually voted for. Have some just had enough of hearing from politicians?) After years of Conservative measures to promote free speech on campus, almost half of universities surveyed by the umbrella body Universities UK thought students did now understand better what that meant. What the Bangor affair underlines, however, is that the right to free speech isn’t the same as the right to a free audience whenever you happen to be campaigning in the neighbourhood; and that whatever you have to say, you can’t actively make people want to listen.Anderton’s tour has now successfully visited five universities and is due in Edinburgh – where a previous event was cancelled by the venue – this evening. But crucially in each of these universities he was invited in, often by interested rightwing student societies. In Bangor, by contrast, he asked for a slot but got no takers.Whatever you think of his Maga ideology, Kirk undeniably turned nerdy political debate into a kind of compelling gladiatorial spectator sport that spawned viral imitators on both sides of the political aisle, perhaps even helping confound the myth that young people can’t manage intellectual confrontation. What Anderton – whose value to Reform is his ability to jump on to gen-Z trends faster than cautious mainstream parties do – may be learning is that that isn’t as easy as Kirk made it look.In this country, it turns out politicians still have to actually earn a hearing, not compel one. Well, that’s freedom for you.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistGuardian Newsroom: Can Labour come back from the brink?On Monday 30 April, ahead of May elections, join Gaby Hinsliff, Zoe Williams, Polly Toynbee and Rafael Behr as they discuss how much of a threat Labour faces from the Green party and Reform – and whether Keir Starmer can survive as leader of the Labour partyBook ticketshereExplore more on these topicsReform UKOpinionUniversitiesWalescommentShareReuse this content"

Votes at 16 is the start of a welcome changeFri 13 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 13 Feb 2026 11.08 ESTShareHere it is as promised, a billintroduced to parliament on Thursdayproposing to give the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds by the next general election. Good. The accusation from the Conservatives and Reform last year was thatthis was gerrymandering. “Rank hypocrisy” says the Sun. If polls had shown that the young traditionally swing to the right, would Labour have espoused this? I don’t know.Nigel Farage’s claim that the young are turning to him is largely overblown,according to YouGov polling, with only 9% of 18 to 24-year-olds saying they would vote Reform – no better than what Ukip achieved in 2015. However there is agender gap, says More in Common, with boysnearly twice as likelyto support parties on the right. The Tories, who will lose out, search for reasons to oppose the bill and come up with some rum arguments. I particularly enjoyedClaire Coutinho’s concernthat young people do not need the “added pressure” of deciding whether to focus on their exams or “stay up to watch” political debates, as elections are often in the summer exam season.In power, the Tories went to great lengths to stop young people voting: David Cameron’s government barred colleges and universities fromregistering students automatically. Meanwhile, parents were barred from registering young people at home, so students’ vote depended on their personal determination to register, at a time of turmoil in their lives – and frequent address changing. It worked, with young people thelargest disenfranchised group.The age when people become more likely to switch to the right reached 66 at the last election. The 16- and 17-year-olds who will actually vote in the next general election are now aged 12-13, so candidates had better get to work on them. Yet the reality is that in our corrupted and perverse electoral system, the votes of these teenagers are highly unlikely to affect any seats: there are too few of them in any one seat to shift the dial even if they all voted for the same candidate, according toresearch by Christine Huebnerat the University of Sheffield, which is a shame. But expect to see candidates hastening to canvass in schools, not just old people’s homes – with promises to the young, not just the old.That’s why this matters. It should be a symbol and a signal of intent to focus policy on the young, who have lost out so badly in the austerity years – with education funding andSure Startcut, and the education maintenance allowance for poorer sixth formers abolished. Meanwhile, during Covid, the young were sacrificed in school closures to save the old from dying. As the old revel in triple-locked pensions and freedom passes regardless of income, families with children are the poorest.Much more should be done to ensure that the old whoarepoor claim their pension credit, but it is uphill work persuading the old as a cohort how privileged we have been all our lives: born into an NHS created for us, staying on longer in comprehensive schools, vast expansion of (free) universities and colleges, a time of massive housebuilding and public investment in libraries, leisure centres and sports. I once gave a talk on a cruise ship explaining to my generation how lucky we were compared with the young – and I feared I’d get thrown overboard in their fury. Look at the young with their lattes and avocado toast, they said; those lazy moaners and snowflakes – “we never had mobile phones in our day”. Politically, shifting significant resources and power from the old (who vote) to young (who don’t much) is risky.Why 16? David Runciman, a professor of politics at the University of Cambridge,suggests voting at age six, which I like. But it might be more politically saleable to give parents caring for children a double vote on their behalf to tilt the electoral arithmetic in a rapidly ageing population: thefertility ratein England and Wales fell to a record low in 2024, to 1.44 children per woman, when it takes 2.1 just to maintain the population. Innovation, rebellion, new ideas, trends and fashions rarely come from the old: stagnation and decay beckon if nostalgia for a world 50 years ago dominates education policy. Even if there were every encouragement for parenthood – housing, free good nurseries, parenting subsidies and, above all, a sense of welcoming children – we would need to rethink attitudes towards welcoming young migrants to keep our population renewed. Jim Ratcliffe’s decrepit complaint about a Britain“colonised by immigrants”let Labour thump back with resounding repudiations.The young, of course, overwhelmingly back votes at 16, butthey are remarkably humble: in August 2025, 46% said they felt informed enough about politics to vote in a general election, while the same proportion said they did not feel informed enough (8% were unsure).They ought to know about the depths ofadult ignorance: the majority are disastrously wrong in their estimates on crime (78% ofpeople polledthink it’s rising when it fell 90% in the last three decades), benefits (many think most goes to the jobless when most goes to pensioners) or how incomes are distributed (extreme inequality is often grossly underestimated).A new school curriculum,out in 2027, will bring in the kind of citizenship education with critical thinking at its core taught brilliantly in some schools, but barely at all in most, killed off by Michael Gove when hedropped itfrom his Ebacc. Accompanying sixth formers to the polling station could give them a habit for life: this is a chance for them to become the most democratically minded generation. Expect a reverse ferret from the right, who can hardly go into the next election still opposing votes at 16.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsYoung peopleOpinionLabourReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

Superhero capes and flatulent animated squirrels? Me too. Fortunately, you and I are in luck. This weekend brings the wide release of Saltburn director Emerald Fennell’s adaptation of Emily Bronte’sWuthering Heights. As is befitting Fennell’s established style, the movie offers over-the-top sexual titillation (though, crucially, zero nudity) and elaborate production design. Plus, a contemporary pop soundtrack from Charli xcx. A horny film version of a 19th-century novel is as adult-skewing as it gets at the box office these days.Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi suck face and stand around in the rain in expensive costumes for over two hours in a movie that Fennell proudly declares a loose translation from the page. It excises a large portion of the book’s story and focuses its eye primarily on the illicit romance between Cathy Earnshaw and swarthy Heathcliff. Crucially, it should be pointed out that Heathcliff is technically Cathy’s foster brother, which allows Wuthering Heights to fit comfortably into one of themost popular genres of online videoin the world.Another crucial change from the book is that bad boy Heathcliff, while described as ethnically ambiguous and “dark” in the novel, is very much a pretty straightforward white Australian Elordi. Fennell says that Elordi most represents the version of Heathcliff she saw in her head when she was 14 and reading the novel for the first time. I can’t quibble too much with that, since Wuthering Heights is squarely in the public domain and film-makers can do whatever they want with it.There are, by my count,18 different filmed adaptations of the book. More often than not, Heathcliff is played by a white actor – Richard Burton, Tom Hardy, Ralph Fiennes and countless others. It’s nearly impossible to accuse Fennell (who also cast the decidedly white roles of Linton and Nelly with actors of color) of whitewashing a story that’s been presented in that fashion for decades. There are exceptions, of course.In the 2011 film directed by Andrea Arnold, Heathcliff is portrayed by James Howson, a Black British actor. Howson was the first Black actor to play Heathcliff in a film, wasplucked out of obscurity for the role, was paid about £8,000 for his work, and quickly went right back to obscurity. The movie was abox office failureand one can’t help but think that one of the main reasons to cast an actor like Jacob Elordi is to ensure enough star power to make back the production budget. Who am I to argue against the holy Saint Commerce?While I’m happy to accept Fennell’s rationale for casting based on her teenage imagination, I would likely go in the other direction if I were in her position. What did I imagine while reading Wuthering Heights at 14? Mostly battle scenes from Star Trek, while hoping my CliffsNotes version would arrive in the mail soon. Can I be criticized for wishing Heathcliff – a sour-faced weirdo whose sole goal in life is pitiless revenge against his foster family – wasn’t white or Black, but Optimus Prime from Transformers? I was 14. What the hell did I know about great literature? With a startling lack of spaceships or cars that turn into robots (and back again), what is an American boy supposed to relate to?But now I’m an adult with a fully developed brain, and I can see Wuthering Heights as a powerful story of class resentment, prejudice and the way those terrible forces curdle the human soul. It seeks to nod to the way in which we other those we don’t understand.Cathy and Heathcliff are kept apart because of his low social status – a status reinforced by Cathy’s brother Hindley forcing Heathcliff into life as a servant. That’s easy to accomplish because Heathcliff is explicitly different from the Earnshaws. Not just because he’s been adopted, but because helooks different. Even his backstory – his race and where he’s from originally – is a mystery that sets him apart from the other characters.One of the most defining characteristics of my own personal backstory is that I’m the product of a interracial marriage and was raised in America, a country where such things were illegal up until the middle of the 20th century. I can still remember the feeling when a grocery-store checkout clerk asked my dad if I was adopted. Interracial relationships and the biracial progeny of them are still a rarity in popular media. One of the most prominent examples is 2015’s Focus, which ironically stars Margot Robbie and Will Smith. It’s a solidly entertaining film, but one that doesn’t really engage with the social subtext of that pairing. Not that it has to.I’m not begging every movie with an interracial coupling to have something heady to say about it. If the charming conman plot of Focus stopped to preach to me about racial tolerance, it would be about as helpful as Transformers or the Starship Enterprise showing up in Wuthering Heights. But Focus wasn’t about those things. Wuthering Heights, in so many ways, is.If I had the ability to make Wuthering Heights as a movie, first of all, I’d probably respectfully decline. I still can’t shake the need to include robots. But if I did do it, I’d probably emphasize the aspects of the story that spoke to me the most – the alienation, the othering and the feeling that basic respect is just outside of my reach.The aspects of Wuthering Heights that spoke to Emerald Fennell the most are clearly kissing a hot guy that is sort of your brother. As is her right. But the one question I’d ask her is this: as a clearly intelligent and talented artist, why was she incapable of imagining a story with an interracial relationship? Maybe for the same reason I imagined Transformers stomping around on the moor. Because we see only what we want to see.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsWuthering HeightsOpinionRacecommentShareReuse this content"

Officially released in the UK this Friday, Emerald Fennell’s movie adaptation of Emily Brontë’s novel features the biggest female star in the world (Margot Robbie), the second-biggest male star (I’m putting Timothée Chalamet ahead of Jacob Elordi, don’t fight me), and Fennell’s unique writing and directing style that gave us so many memorable moments inSaltburn. On Monday the flag goes up and we’re off!Let’s start with the nice stuff; it’ll take less time. Still cleaving to the counterintuitive, New York magazine gave the film athumbs upfor being “smooth-brained”, “incredibly moist” and Fennell’s “dumbest movie”, which, the writer assured us, also happens to be – wah-wah – “her best to date”. The Hollywood Reporterjudged it“pulpy, provocative, drenched in blazing color … and resonantly tragic”, while the Atlanticwent for“a heaving, rip-snortingly carnal good time at the cinema”. Fennell cannot, after all, be held responsible for bad writing from her reviewers so we’ll put down to coincidence the fact that every critic who liked the film was having an off day.Tell us: has the new Wuthering Heights film adaptation inspired you to read Emily Brontë’s novel?Read moreUnsurprisingly, the Brits were less generous than the Americans. The Independent’s one-star review called the film “an astonishingly hollow work” and “whimperingly tame”, while the Times went for “vapid” and “awful” and this newspaperdeemed it“ersatz” and “quasi-erotic”. I can’t judge; I’ve only seen the trailer, in which Elordi looks like the comic Joe Wilkinson and the movie like bad Baz Luhrmann – which is saying something, given how bad the actual Baz Luhrmann is these days. But maybe it gets better as it goes on.Back to the US for the final word, where “underneath her brazen streak” Fennell isaccused bythe New Yorker of showing “a certain wobbliness of conviction – a failure of nerve”, and the film of exhibiting a “curious redundancy” – a very New Yorkerish way of saying it sucked.View image in fullscreen‘I had this idea before Trump did it.’Photograph: Alishia Abodunde/GettyTuesdayThe Fargo-esquekidnap of Savannah Guthrie’s motherenters its second week in the news cycle and the number of fatuous experts continues to multiply. Guthrie, a prominent US newscaster who should have been anchoring NBC News during the Winter Olympics this week, is instead appealing nightly on US TV for whoever kidnapped her 84-year-old mother from her Arizona home on 1 February to please get in touch and return her.The New York Post rustled up a retired FBI man who suggested the aggressor seen on Nancy Guthrie’s doorcam was likely “an amateur” based on how he’d holstered his gun. ABC News’s retired FBI guy said the ransom note may not have been authentic, while on CNN, a retired FBI agent encouraged viewers to study the doorcam footage in case they recognised the masked figure from his walk – “so-called ‘gait analysis’,” said the agent. Only the best and the brightest at the FBI.On social media, meanwhile, a popular casting director used her experience with actors to offer insights into the family, in particular Guthrie’s two siblings, who appeared on camera in an appeal to the kidnapper (she thought their upset looked fake). As of Friday morning, Nancy Guthrie remained missing and all the armchair analysts took their place in the pantheon of ghouls going back to news around Joanne Lees, the McCanns and Lindy Chamberlain.WednesdayPrincess Eugenie hasbeen seenin the Middle East at Art Basel Qatar – an event she attended, according to Hello magazine, in her capacity as director of an art gallery. It must be hard, and I do sympathise; the sins of the father, etc. Still, the fact is that even the most innocent business undertakings emanating from that branch of the royal family trigger unfortunate echoes.In the past year or so, Eugenie’s sister, Princess Beatrice, hasattendedan investment conference in Saudi Arabia, appeared in a promotional photo for a UAE bank, and addressed an energy conference in Abu Dhabi in whichshe referredto AI as “literally my favourite subject”. The princess was there in a private capacity, you understand, although possibly not one recommended by her extensive knowledge of AI.All of which makes one look admiringly in the direction of the Phillips children. Zara on her horse, Peter doing whatever it is Peter does, neither of whom, at Princess Anne’s request, took on royal titles when they were born and who have rarely if ever felt moved to “promote British trade” abroad, officially or otherwise.ThursdayIt’s very Fleabag season 2, only instead of a whimsical hamster cafe promoting social health via Chatty Wednesdays, it’s aninitiativeby English Heritage to encourage social interaction via Bonding Benches. The benches will be introduced at some of the UK’s most famous landmarks, including Stonehenge and Tintagel Castle in Cornwall, where users will be able to slide a sign between “up for a chat” and “craving quiet”.I love this idea, even if it mainly works only at the notional level. The initiative has been designed with parents of young children in mind, who are prone to isolation and might like a more structured opportunity to bond. The only improvement I can think of is to expand the range of the signs. As well as “quiet” and “chat”, how about: “Don’t even look at me”, “Stay at least three inches away from my body” and “Don’t come anywhere near me with anything that looks like a need”.View image in fullscreen‘I can’t believe Feathers McGraw’s in the Epstein files.’Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAFridayFriends visiting from out of town want to go on the tourist bus through London, so here we are in light rain on the open-top deck. My observation, never having done this before, is: so many bridges! Also: did you know that All Hallows by the Tower is the oldest church in London and was founded in AD675? Take that, New York – and sorry, in this instance, even Paris can do one. Turns out the bus tour brings on feelings of jingoism, for which I apologise but it’s all very stirring.A couple of things: I’m not sure the Royal Palaces of Justice deserve to be summarised in the audio tour with: “Here are the steps where Johnny Depp stood recently”, and maybe there’s something about Southwark Bridge more notable than the fact it served as the backdrop for a scene from Harry Potter?

Nearly a century later, the BBC World Service, as it is now known,broadcasts in 43 languages, reaches 313 million people a weekand is one of the UK’s most influential cultural assets. It is also a lifeline for millions.“Perhaps Britain’s greatest gift to the world”in the 20th century, as Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general, once put it.But this week Tim Davie, the corporation’s director general,announcedthat the World Service will run out of funding in just seven weeks. Most of its£400mbudget comes from the licence fee, although the Foreign Office – which funded it entirely until 2014 –contributed £137m in the last year. The funding arrangement with the Foreign Office finishes at the end of March. There is no plan for what happens next.Meanwhile, Russia and China are pouring billions into state-run media. And American news organisations are crumbling under the Trump administration. Last weekthe Washington Postaxed 300 jobs including its Ukraine reporter, and hundreds were lost atVoice of America, the closest US equivalent to the BBC, last year.Although some question why licence-fee payers should subsidise services largely consumed abroad, it is also loved by many at home. In the small hours, it is a window on a dark world, an alternative to doomscrolling and a pushback against parochialism. Jeremy Paxmansummed it upwhen he compared the World Service to a cords- and cardigan-wearing “ageing uncle who’s seen it all. It has a style that makes understatement seem like flamboyance”. But we should not allow this cosy, slightly fusty image to obscure its purpose.For many it is not just life-enhancing, but life‑saving. Last month, during the internet blackout in Iran, the BBC’s Persian service providedadditional radio programmes over shortwave and medium wave. Emergency services were also launched in response to conflicts inUkraine, Syria, Gaza andSudan, and after the earthquake inMyanmar. It remains the only international news organisation still broadcasting inside Afghanistan, setting up an education programme forAfghan childrenin 2024.But it has been beleaguered by cuts, closures andjob losses. In 2022, radio broadcasts in 10 languages including Arabic, Persian, Chinese and Bengali werereplacedby digital services, a decisioncriticisedfor disproportionately affecting women, who rely most on radios. Wherever the BBC has been forced to withdraw – for financial or political pressures – propaganda has been quick to fill the gap.No one doubts the World Service’s value as an instrument of soft power. But, as BBC bossesargue, it is also part of our national security. Accurate journalism is the strongest weapon in the war of information. The World Service must not be allowed to stumble into decline. Mr Davie is right – if optimistic – to urge the government to back it decisively and urgently.During the second world war, radio was “scattering human voices into the darkness of Europe”,Penelope Fitzgeraldwrote in her 1980 novel Human Voices, based on her time working for the BBC. Amid the AI noise and disinformation, the World Service must be enabled to keep scattering human voices in our own dark times.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It usually takes an economic rebound, a dramatic political reset or an opposition implosion to reverse the slide.Sir Keir Starmer’spersonal ratings are in a danger zone from which few escape.Yet the prime minister, like the Bourbons, has learnt nothing and forgotten nothing. He made a speech this week after coming close to being ousted suggesting he would “fight” on. Hedoubled downin parliament despite glaring errors in judgment. Heforced outhis cabinet secretary while his ownfailuresremain unaddressed. He seemed to blame everyone but himself. When support slips and a leader answers with defiance, voters don’t see strength – they see denial.The bigger picture, as the Resolution Foundationsaidthis week, is that living standards are forecast to rise up by just 0.3% a year until 2029-30 – even weaker than the previous decade’s 0.4% annual growth, which included Covid and the energy crisis. Britain, under Sir Keir’s stewardship, is set to grow more slowly in “normal times” than it did during national emergencies.The prime minister’s claim to responsible management is undone by his own incompetence. Public trust ebbs away – a worry when voters start shopping around andReform UKissellingracism. Stagnation exposes governments that lack an economic model. That is why interventions this week by Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, andDaisy Cooper, the Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson, matter. Both accept that cost of living pressure is becoming politically dangerous and that the status quo isn’t working.TheLib Demswant to shake up Whitehall. They are calling for a break up of the Treasury and its replacement with a new department of growth based in Birmingham. The most radical idea is that the growth department would set fiscal policies. That might be a very good idea if it opened up the space for productive cash injections with an acknowledgment that fiscal deficits are required to rebuild the social democratic space.By contrast, Mr Burnham’splanis a revolution: roll back Thatcherism and restore politics to the heart of economics. Hence his call for electoral reform, abandoning the parliamentary whip system and replacing the House of Lords with an elected senate of nations and regions. A new political settlement, he says, is a precondition to achieve public control of essentials – such as housing and utilities – to reduce costs and support productivity.Mr Burnham’s distance from Westminster – after hispath backwas closed by Sir Keir – gives him freedom to speak out. His proposal logically implies a constitutional role for metro mayors. In this vision, the national government sets the macro framework; regions control infrastructure and housing, and the senate safeguards territorial interests. That would be a welcome and different version of the UK from today’s Treasury dominated unitary state.Zack Polanski’s Greensurgehas made radical talk respectable and cost of living politics inescapable, especially ahead of an upcoming Manchester byelection in what was asafe Labour seat. The Greens are part of a wider revolt against Britain’s economic model. From Labour’s soft left, Mr Burnham offers structural overhaul, while the Lib Dems promise a growth engine, and the Greens push redistribution. Meanwhile, Sir Keir’s Labour is governing inside a failed model rather than replacing it. That looks politically fatal.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I do not like sarcastic or passive aggressive “thank yous”, but what is wrong with thanking people in the service industry for the service they give? I do not believe that it is overworked or meaningless. I love to thank baristas, shop assistants, bus drivers or other people because they more often than not provide a very good service. They work hard and are not paid a lot of money. They are often people doing jobs that are difficult for one reason or another.Why not be kind and appreciative? Isn’t there enough hardship and negativity in these febrile times?Deirdre BreenDublin, IrelandYour article makes me incredibly sad. It most cases “thank you” does not mean “I’m infinitely grateful for your selfless act of service”. In most cases it just means “I see you”. It is a recognition that the other person matters and is not invisible.It means, for example, that I see that the bus is driven by a person, not by a machine, and it means that I see that this person had to get up even earlier than me for driving this bus, facing a wind of ice cold air anytime they open the front door for new passengers. I hope we will never give up on too many “I see yous” during a day, as they do matter.Lotte Lina KaiserGeneva, SwitzerlandWhile I might agree with some of Sangeeta Pillai’s comments, I maintain that it’s necessary in a civilised society to show appreciation and gratitude. It’s nice to be thanked; and even nicer if one’s name is used. However, it can be excessive. I recently heard a shop assistant in New York say: “Thank you so very much, now you enjoy your underwear.” I assert that we as a nation apologise far too much. I lived on and off in France for nearly 20 years. I think I heard “je suis désolé”maybe three times. But they are generous with “merci”.Roger MortimoreDorking, SurreyI enjoyed Sangeeta Pillai’s piece. Have you noticed that, these days, a simple “thank you” will no longer suffice? It’s now “thank you so much”?Stephen BlakemoreFolkestone, KentI am sorry, Sangeeta, people in this country say “sorry” a lot more than they say “thank you”!Stephanie BaileyNorton-sub-Hamdon, SomersetHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

We rely on access to cash. Our lives still include paying small sums – £2.50 for entry and a coffee at our many village societies (open to all), or £5 for lunch provided fortnightly by volunteers – and varying sums to sponsor fundraising or village facilities, or small amounts to travel on our community bus.Sammy mentioned how using cash brought more face-to-face contact: such interactions are increasingly rare in our current busy lives, but they are a great benefit to communities of all types. He also drew attention to the gain from using cash and realising how much items cost – and then considering how necessary or otherwise each item was. We all need any help we can find in these times of high living costs.Val MajorBristolThe article shines a welcome light on the dangers of digital apartheid, denying people the option to use cash even for basic public services.A striking example is that it costs £10 simply to buy an Oyster card. This is not a deposit, but a charge for a piece of plastic that presumably is made for pennies. Denying people the right to use cash on London transport, then profiteering through the sale of Oyster cards at an obscene profit margin, is cynical and exploitative. In Athens, for example, as in other European capital cities, the equivalent loadable public transport card is free of charge.Christopher RuaneLanarkSammy Gecsoyler chose to use only cash for day-to-day spending for a week, and his resulting article was quite lighthearted. But for those who, for whatever reason, use only cash as the norm, it’s not amusing at all to be so often turned away from shops, cafes, cultural venues and so on.Albert BealeLondonI seem to recall that, in retail establishments, it was compulsory to accept legal tender. Is this no longer the case?

Consent decrees are the legal mechanism by which the agency and US Department of Justice enforce environmental laws against major polluters.The agency appears to have similarly slowed enforcement of Superfund laws, which cover the cleanup at the nation’s most polluted sites. It filed just seven consent decrees, down from 31 under the firstTrump administration.Trump’s EPA repeals landmark climate finding in gift to ‘billionaire polluters’Read moreThe number of Clean Water Act enforcement actions has also dramatically declined from a peak of 18 during Biden’s first year, to four during the second Trump administration, the analysis by the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (Peer) non-profit found.The EPA’s enforcement program “is dying on the vine, and that’s intentional”, said Tim Whitehouse, Peer’s executive director and a former EPA attorney.“Without an adequate enforcement program that provides deterrence to polluters, the laws become voluntary, and when laws become voluntary many companies choose to ignore them because they know there are no consequences,” Whitehouse said. “That means more pollution for communities near the facilities and more profits or the polluters.”The analysis looked only at major cases. When the EPA investigates a major case, it forwards the allegations to the justice department, which brings cases against the polluter in federal court and seeks a settlement.Major cases are typically brought against large corporations, including Volkswagen, which in 2017agreed to pay$1.4bn for a Clean Air Act violation for installing “defeat devices” that evaded emissions tests. In Indiana in 2023, the EPA found BP to be emitting dangerous levels of highly toxic VOCs into the air andrequiredit to pay $250m in penalties and corrective measures. Norfolk Southern, which was responsible for the 2023 East Palestine, Ohio, train wreck, settled for $335m for Clean Water Act violations, including penalties and cleanup.Similar blockbuster settlements are now rare, industry observers say.An EPA spokesperson defended the administration’s enforcement record in a statement to the Guardian.“Unlike the last administration, we are focused on achieving swift compliance and not just overzealous enforcement intended to cripple industry based on climate zealotry,” the spokesperson said. “One erroneous report from a leftwing group funded by dark money does not change the facts.”A current EPA enforcement employee who declined to use their name for fear of retribution said there was a significant difference between “compliance” the Trump administration is touting and “enforcement” with punitive measures. The latter is a deterrent, the former largely is not, the employee said.“They want us to do more of what they call compliance rather than enforcement – inspect a company, and say ‘Hey maybe do these things better,’ and maybe give them a slap on the wrist, but do not impose significant changes or fines,” the employee said.The employee reviewed Peer’s data and said it aligned with what they see anecdotally. They said several actions by the administration over the last year were driving the enforcement decline.Trump’s political appointees at the top of the EPA are more closely scrutinizing investigators’ work. Enforcement agents must send a case far up the chain of command if a company disagrees with an investigation’s findings. Similar approval is required if an EPA investigator wants to require action beyond what the law requires. That is important, the employee said, because the law often does not require the steps that are needed to fully correct a violation.The requirements have also caused a review backlog that is delaying cases, the employee said.Meanwhile, the Trump administration has at times effectively paused enforcement action against the energy industry. A12 March EPA memostated that enforcement actions will no longer “shut down any stage of energy production”.At the same time, staffing levels in the enforcement division are down by as much as 30% in some regions, the employee estimated, while the number of justice department environmental division attorneys is down by about 50%.The sum of these issues creates a “broad chilling effect” on enforcement, the employee said. Investigators are afraid to take bold action and try to not attract political appointees’ attention, they said.“That means that the American people are at risk of health impacts from pollution of air, water, and companies are going to feel emboldened to get away with more,” the employee said. “They know that the people at the EPA and DoJ are friendly to industry and aren’t going to enforce the laws against them.”The EPA spokesperson said the agency had concluded more cases in the first year than the Biden administration did in its first year, and the agency would be publishing those figures soon.However, the Peer report looked at major cases, not all cases. The EPA handles minor enforcement as a civil administrative case. This has included issues such as a mechanic shop that illegally dumps small amounts of a pollutant into a stream. The cases are investigated by EPA inspectors, who may issue a notice of violation. They attempt to reach a settlement in which the polluter must agree to a remedy and potentially a fine.In its report, the Peer addressed that claim, writing “administrative enforcement is a good way to handle violations that can be resolved quickly and are less likely to be repeated”.“But they are not well suited for large, complex cases that warrant higher penalties or the substantial, long-term remedies needed both to correct any violations and to prevent their recurrence,” the report states.The attack on enforcement is part of a broader effort to weaken the EPA, Whitehouse said. The administration has also attacked scientific research and protective regulations.“The Zeldin EPA is conducting itself as a subsidiary of oil and chemical industries and other big, powerful industries in the US,” Whitehouse said. “It is really doing the work of those types of industries, and, bigger picture enforcement is a large part of that.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationPollutionUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The waters fuel an estimated $1.4tn in economic activity, and raised bustling cities, including Los Angeles, Phoenix and Las Vegas. The sprawling basin is also home to diverse ecosystems, with scores of birds, fish, plants and animals, and provides critical habitat for more than 150 threatened or endangered species.But the river has been overdrawn for more than a century. As demand continues to grow, rising temperatures and lower precipitation caused by the climate crisis are taking an increasingly larger share of declining supplies, a trend only expected to worsen as the world warms.Western US gripped by extreme snow drought: ‘I’ve never seen a winter like this’Read moreUp to 4m acre-feet of cuts are needed to bring the basin back into balance – an amount equal to more than a quarter of its annual average flow. One acre-foot, a unit denoting the amount of water that can cover a football field one foot deep, is equal to roughly 326,000 gallons – enough to supply roughly three families for a year.A recordsnow droughtplaguing the region this year is expected toreduce water suppliesfurther, which added another layer of urgency to the talks.“There needs to be unbelievably harsh, unprecedented cuts” that will affect water users in major ways, said Dr Brad Udall, senior water and climate research scientist at Colorado State University’s ColoradoWaterCenter. “Mother Nature is not going to bail us out.”Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico, which form the upper-basin states – have resisted any cuts to their share, insisting lower-basin states –California, Arizona and Nevada – are responsible for creating the deficit. Because they are situated closer to the headwaters, their supply doesn’t come from the reservoirs that the lower basins draw from.The lower basin has balked at the idea. They have already agreed to take substantial cuts and are demanding their neighbors to the north share the burden. Whiledisagreements range across a series of issues, this is a major sticking point.The states have been at an impasse for months, afterblowing through a deadline last Novemberand this week’s breakdown in the talks signals how entrenched the opposing parties are.In a joint statement on Friday, the governors of the California,Arizonaand Nevada insisted that “all seven basin states must share in the responsibility of conservation”.“The federal deadline for a consensus agreement on managing the Colorado River after 2026 is passing for a second time without resolution,” said Gavin Newsom, Katie Hobbs and Joe Lombardo. “The stakes couldn’t be higher for our lower basin states of Arizona, California andNevada.”It’s unclear how quickly the federal government will move to issue its plan, or if there can be more room made for discussions to continue.“This is the second time the Bureau of Reclamation has given us a deadline without a consequence,” Rhett Larson, a professor of water law at Arizona State University said. “A deadline without a consequence is just a date.”View image in fullscreenBoaters seen in Lake Powell, one of two critical reservoirs along the Colorado river. US states are facing a deadline to decide how to divide the river’s water between them.Photograph: Rebecca Noble/ReutersIf the states can’t produce a path forward, the federal government hasthreatened to issue its own,one likely to deeply slash the lower-basin states’ shares.Four draft proposalsreleased for public comment in Januaryinclude severe reductions of lower states’ supply.Any of the federal options on the table would almost certainly result in lawsuits and complex court battles, an outcome everyone would like to avoid.Still, the basin urgentlyneeds a plan – one that goes far beyond the complex matrix of laws and agreements expiring this year that have been unable to keep pace with the rapidly widening gap between supply and demand.“Everyone agrees we have to use less water, the problem is states look at each other and say you should use less,” said Dr Jack Schmidt, the director of the Center for Colorado River Studies atUtahState University.The negotiations have been like the final scene in Thelma and Louise, he added. “Seven people have their hands on the steering wheel driving toward the edge of a cliff – and no one is working the brakes.”‘A system that fails us when we need it most’Along with supplying vast water needs across the west, arguments have centered on how much should be released to protect the critical reservoirs of Lake Powell and Lake Mead. Storage in these reservoirs has fallen to historic lows and experts have warned that just a couple of dry years could put them at critical levels.If they fell far enough, the system would cease to function altogether. So-called “deadpool” – when water isn’t high enough to pass through the dams and be distributed downriver – would be catastrophic.Seven people have their hands on the steering wheel driving toward the edge of a cliff – no one is working the brakesJack Schmidt, director of the Center for Colorado River StudiesSchmidt said the federal government would intervene long before deadpool. But if desperately dry conditions like those expected this year fail to improve, then even the Bureau of Reclamation’sproposals might not be able to stabilize the system, according to the environmental analysis released with the alternatives in January.“That’s pretty damn scary,” Schmidt said. Water managers may have to make urgent decisions in the coming months, even if agreements aren’t in place and the problems could get more complicated still.“We know temperatures are going up – and going up quite rapidly,” Udall said. Hotter environments mean faster evaporation. It shifts the timing of snowmelt and runoff, produces drier soils, and thirsty plants soak up more water. Flows in the Colorado are down 20% over the last century and precipitation has shrunk by about 7%.“The chickens are coming home to roost,” he said. “Climate models have underestimated how much warming we are going to get, and humans are not stepping up.”View image in fullscreenA formerly sunken boat sits high and dry along the shoreline of Lake Mead.Photograph: John Locher/APShortages could lead to dramatic changes in how water is distributed in the future. More than 70% of water is used by agriculture – which includes thirsty crops like alfalfa and hay that are used to feed cattle and the bulk of the winter lettuce and leafy greens grown in the US. The irrigation systems were set up long before suburbs began to sprawl across the deserts, and frameworks that govern the river dictate that that’s why they get their shares first.“But you can’t fallow cities,” Udall said. While municipalities need to do more to conserve, “it’s the farmers that will hurt – that’s just super clear,” he added. “We have created a system that was supposed to provide certainty that fails us when we need it most.”‘We are facing a system crash’There had been hope that negotiators could strike a smaller, short-term deal that would provide incremental steps that buy more time for the big issues.With the conditions as dire as they are this year, Udall said it was unlikelythe stateswould be able to fall back on short-term solutions this time.“Maybe in a normal winter you could impose less drastic solutions, but given the snow drought we have right now and the state of the reservoirs, the federal government is going to have to impose a solution,” Udall said. “I would bet you dollars to donuts that the lawsuits are going to fly.”Larson, who also serves as council for the Arizona Municipal Water Users Association, representing 10 of the large central Arizona cities, said the federal proposals all have “fatal flaws” for Arizona, and other states that will be asked to carry enormous cuts.It’s likely Arizona will sue, and be joined by California and Nevada. But the lawsuits might not end there.If dry conditions push river flows low enough that lower-basin states don’t receive their share secured in the original compact over a century ago, another lawsuit could be filed against the upper-basin states themselves. Legal disputes would center on whether the upper basin can be held responsible for losses in supply due to climate change. An interstate water law conflict like this would go straight to the US supreme court.While the legal battles unfold, “somebody has still got to manage an ever-dwindling river”, Larson said.View image in fullscreenA field of spinach is irrigated with Colorado River water in California. More than 70% of water from the river is used by agriculture.Photograph: Caitlin Ochs/ReutersIt’s an outcome thatDr John Berggren, regional policy manager at Western Resource Advocates, said, would ultimately be a failure for the river, leaving little room to manage the challenges of a highly complicated system.“[Litigation] kind of freezes everything – and environmental values are one of the first things to go,” he said. “They’ll protect the reservoirs as best they can, but they’re probably not going to be able to consider environmental flows and things that actually benefit the river itself.”Berggren added that the waterway needed flexibility, especially during dry years. Emergency actions – especially those governed by courts and not experts – can’t take account of things like timing and temperature, that are so vital to protecting the river’s ecosystems.“It’s not just a pipeline,” he said, “it’s a living river.”We are facing a system crash. The river is not going to wait for process or politicsMatt Rice, regional director of American RiversThe ecosystems on the banks of the river have already paid a heavy price. Fourteen native fish species are endangered or threatened. The once-lush wetlands in Mexico’s river delta have been dry for decades and the once mighty river slows to just a trickle as it crosses over the US-Mexico border. “That’s an ecosystem that is lost,” Schmidt said, “and no one is talking about returning it to its former glory.”Before the negotiators ended their talks on Friday, Matt Rice, the south-west regional director for the conservation organization American Rivers, said he was clinging to hope that something would come out of the negotiations.Rice has seen year after year of crisis management play out on the river, and lessons continue to go unlearned.“The positive thing is we know what to do,” he added. Conservation efforts across the Colorado River basin have been successful. Cities in the region have reduced water-use by 18% over the last two decades, even as some saw their populations grow. Farmers have adopted more efficient irrigation systems, infrastructure can be updated for better efficiency and conservationists are working to restore watersheds.But these fixes have not gone far enough – not by a long shot. Rice said there needed to be a new approach, framed not as an emergency cut that goes from crisis to crisis, but as adaptation to an arid future.For that, the deadline isn’t coming from the federal government, it’s being imposed by the waterway itself.“We are facing a system crash,” he said. “The river is not going to wait for process or politics.”Explore more on these topicsColorado river crisisColoradoWaterUtahWyomingNew MexicoCalifornianewsShareReuse this content"

Rivers are suffering from a toxic cocktail of sewage discharge from water companies, forever chemicals and road and agricultural runoff.Bathing water status requires more rigorous testing by the regulator, the Environment Agency, which is required to monitor the water for faecal indicator organisms.Watercompanies have come under pressure to cut sewage pollution in areas that have been designated as bathing water sites.At Ilkley in West Yorkshire, where the Wharfe became the first river to be given bathing water status, Yorkshire Water is implementing more than £85m in infrastructure improvements to boost water quality.View image in fullscreenDischarge seen flowing into the River Thames at Crossness sewage treatment works.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesSave our Swale, the local campaign group that submitted the application for the River Swale in Yorkshire, said bathers had used the river at Richmond Falls for decades but it had been polluted by several water company sewage spills from storm overflows.Deborah Meara, the chair of Save our Swale, said, “Getting this far has involved a lot of hard work by our volunteer team, and we are grateful for all the hours, often spent in pouring rain, sampling at our test sites up and down the Swale.“If SOS does finally achieve designated bathing water status, it will be an important benefit to the community, as the location is used by hundreds of people in the summer months and they deserve to bathe in their local river without risk from raw sewage pollution.”Local communities are being invited to have their say on the proposals for the 13 sites in a six-week public consultation.Emma Hardy, the water and flooding minister, said: “Rivers and beaches are at the heart of so many communities – where people come together, families make memories, and swimmers of all ages feel the benefits of being outdoors safely. Our plans to designate new bathing water sites show how we are backing local ambition and recognising the pride in places that matter most to people.”The new designations would increase the number of designated bathing water areas to 464.Head of campaigns at River Action, Amy Fairman, said, “We welcome efforts to classify more of the UK’s waterways as bathing sites, as this means they will be monitored seasonally for pollution.”But she said water quality in all but two of England’s 14 designated inland bathing sites were rated poor. “This is a national embarrassment, especially when France has over 1,200 inland bathing sites with most rated excellent.“Until water companies are restructured to put people, nature and society ahead of profit, agricultural pollution is properly tackled, and the chemical cocktail choking our waterways is curbed, our rivers will remain among the dirtiest in Europe.”The sites under consultation are:Little Shore, Amble, NorthumberlandNewton and Noss Creeks, DevonCanvey Island Foreshore, EssexSandgate Granville Parade Beach, KentQueen Elizabeth Gardens, Salisbury, WiltshireEast Beach at West Bay, Bridport, DorsetPangbourne Meadow, BerkshireRiver Fowey in Lostwithiel, CornwallRiver Swale in Richmond, YorkshireFalcon Meadow, Bungay, SuffolkRiver Thames at Ham and Kingston, Greater LondonNew Brighton Beach (east), MerseysideRiver Dee at Sandy Lane, Chester, CheshireExplore more on these topicsRiversWaterSwimmingLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

There were more than 20,000 birds in the 1970s.Country diary: Capercaillies need peace to survive, let’s give it to them | Amanda ThomsonRead moreThe males were counted at spring lekking sites – “lek” is Old Norse for play – when the showy black and red birds perform spectacular “flutter jumps” and make popping and clicking sounds to woo the smaller, camouflaged females.Thecapercaillie is decliningbecause of wetter springs and summers, loss of high-quality forest habitat, increased predation of its eggs and chicks, collisions with deer fences and human disturbance, with even fears thatsocial media attention is disrupting the birds. Low genetic diversity in the surviving population may also be a factor.AtRSPB Abernethy, conservationists have trialled a remote-controlled mower to remove dominant heather in inaccessible terrain to allow the thriving of blaeberry, which is an important food source for capercaillie – also hosting moth caterpillars that are vital protein for young chicks. The mower also creates open bare areas where chicks can stay warm after rain.Virtual fence collars on cattle have also enabled targeted forest grazing in areas where fencing would be difficult to install or could pose a collision threat to the flying capercaillie.Abernethy holds more than 20% of the 143 lekking males recorded in the 2025 national lek count.Richard Mason, conservation manager at RSPB Abernethy, said: “The increase in the number of lekking male capercaillie is thanks to the huge amount of work we are undertaking to improve habitat quality. The combination of cutting and extensive cattle grazing has dramatically improved conditions in the forest. We are seeing many chicks reaching full size and whilst the future of capercaillie remains in the balance, we are hopeful that these techniques can support their recovery inScotland.“There is still a lot of work to be done for capercaillie, not just at RSPB Abernethy, but across all capercaillie sites in Scotland. By enhancing these native pinewood forests, we can collectively work towards the recovery of this incredible bird.”There have been recent hopeful counts in other forests, including Strathspey, which recorded anincrease in male capercaillies in 2023.This article was amended on 13 February 2026 because an earlier version suggested that the capercaillie is only found in the Caledonian pine forests of the Scottish Highlands. That is true for UK locations, however the bird is also found in other countries.Explore more on these topicsEndangered speciesWildlifeBirdsScotlandTrees and forestsConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

Two other tracks from Debí Tirar Más Fotos are in this week’s Top 20, with Nuevayol at No 15 and Baile Inolvidable at No 20. In the UK, where non-English language hits are rare, an artist having three Spanish-language songs in the Top 20 at once is likely to be unprecedented.Bad Bunny’s half-time show was a global sensation:accordingto NFL and Ripple Analytics, its 128.2 million viewers made it the fourth most watched Super Bowl half-time show in US television history (behind Kendrick Lamar’s show last year, Michael Jackson in 1993 and Usher in 2024), while more than half of views on social media came from outside the US.Rightwingers had criticised the booking, and after the show Donald Trump called it “absolutely terrible, one of the worst … a slap in the face to our country”. But there was anoutpouringof admiration elsewhere, from political figures such as Gavin Newsom and Meghan McCain toa five-star Guardian reviewby Stefanie Fernández, who wrote that Bad Bunny “reminded so many of us of the love, the community and the absolute joy that we create together every day in spite of everything else”.Elsewhere in the charts, Taylor Swift jumps 14 places to No 1 with her single Opalite, boosted by the launch ofits music videostarring Graham Norton and the guests from his talkshow on the week Swift appeared, who included Domhnall Gleeson and Lewis Capaldi.Olivia Dean’s The Art of Loving is at No 1 in the album chart for the seventh non-consecutive week, having not left the Top 5 since its release in September. J Cole is the highest new entry at No 3 with what is billed as his final album,The Fall Off.The Official Charts Company has launched a new classical album chart this week, featuring the albums “released in the past 12 months that are making an impact across the UK, ranked by UK sales and streams”. Topping it in its first week is 21-year-old South Korean pianist Yunchan Lim, with an album of recordings of Bach’s Goldberg Variations recorded live in Carnegie Hall.Explore more on these topicsBad BunnyUK chartsPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a very well-loved tree and it means a lot,” Celia Steven, 85, said. “Sadly people are a bit prone to cut down trees and think about it later so I find it very disturbing.”The more than 220-year-old tree was grown from a pip planted by Mary Anne Brailsford between 1809 and 1815. Its apples were discovered nearly 50 years later by local gardener Henry Merryweather in a garden owned by Matthew Bramley. Merryweather was given permission to take cuttings from the Bramley seedling as long as the apples he sold bore Bramley’s name.Steven said her great-grandfather, Merryweather, “believed in that apple, he commercialised it, he marketed it, he promoted it … he called it the ‘King of Covent Garden’”. Since then, it has become one of Britain’s best loved cooking apples.Despite the historic nature of the tree, it has never been granted a tree preservation order, which would protect it under law and prevent it from being chopped down.It has, however, been recognised by the royal family. In 2002, the queen’s golden jubilee cited the Bramley as one of the 50 “great British trees” and two decades later it was recognised as part of a selection of 70 ancient trees dedicated to the queen for the platinum jubilee.Steven said: “Our ancient trees are not protected in the way they should be. They’re not revered in the way they should be. They’re very special to this country and when we have got such things we do need to look after them and protect them for the future.”Dan Llywelyn Hall, the founder of the Mother Bramley legacy fund, said such heritage trees should never be at risk like this. The 45-year-old artist, who is hoping to fundraise £400,000 with the Merryweather family to buy the site, said the tree had been “in a state of neglect” since the university bought the cottages.Despite this, and the fact the Bramley was diagnosed with an incurable honey fungus, it is still alive and producing apples, he said.View image in fullscreenThe Bramley is ‘a million-in-one apple highly regarded in the culinary world’, said Dan Llywelyn- Hall, the founder of the Mother Bramley legacy fund.Photograph: Paul Maguire/Alamy“It can’t be understated, it’s the most important, most famous apple tree in the world. It’s produced a million-in-one apple which is highly regarded in the culinary world. The fact we have the original still alive is quite an extraordinary thing,” he said.“It brings a bigger national discussion up here as to why we are terrible in this country at looking after our heritage trees,” he said.‘It’s appalling’: original bramley apple tree being neglected, say campaignersRead moreA Nottingham Trent University spokesperson said: “NTU is proud to have been the latest custodian of the Bramley apple tree and to have played a part in helping to safeguard and celebrate its legacy.“When the university became custodian it was well known that the tree had outlived its natural lifespan by quite some time. We have worked hard using our academic expertise to maintain it in the most careful and appropriate way for a tree of this age and condition and been delighted to provide access to members of the public and for annual events such as the Bramley apple festival and Heritage Open Days. Without the dedication and hard work of our colleagues, we believe it would have deteriorated significantly further.“We were visited by an independent tree specialist last year who paid tribute to the work we have done to both maintain and celebrate it. We also reached out individually to people in Southwell with a special connection to the tree before the cottages were listed for sale and, again, people expressed support for the work we have undertaken.“The university aims to ensure that the tree will remain in the care of a responsible custodian. We will also continue to provide expert guidance and support to them on how to care for the tree.”Explore more on these topicsNottinghamFruitFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

This is the second time the way we have done our duty in the wake of the supreme court’s ruling has been tested in the courts. Both times our actions have been found to be lawful.“It’s our job to champion everyone’s rights under the Equality Act, including those with the protected characteristics of sex, sexual orientation and gender reassignment. A shared and correct understanding of the law is essential to that endeavour.”The ruling did find there was “scope for a strong argument” that allowing a trans woman to use a female toilet did not amount to discrimination against biological men, as some have argued since the supreme court ruling.But in applying the ruling to workplaces, Swift came to the conclusion that transgender employees being forced to out themselves to co-workers by using unisex toilets did not amount to less favourable treatment in the eyes of the law, stating “up to a point, being the subject of comment by others is burden that anyone can expect to bear from time to time, and ought not to be a foundation for legal redress”.The GLP director and founder, Jolyon Maugham, said this “wave away as ‘workplace gossip’ evidence of what it means to be outed in an increasingly transphobic and violent society” was “deeply troubling”. The GLP said it planned to appeal against the decision.Maugham added: “I urge the judiciary to listen harder to what trans people say about what their lives have become.”Melanie Field, a former civil servant who played a key role in drafting the Equality Act, said: “Sadly this judgment has not provided the clarity many were hoping for in this atmosphere where there are hardline positions on both sides and employers and service providers remain uncertain of their duties. Its reliance on the provision of universal and ‘third spaces’ to meet the needs of trans people raises practical challenges and could impact on the overall availability of single-sex facilities and the ability of trans and disabled people to live in equal dignity with others.“It is positive in that it seems to reduce the risk that a women’s service that chooses to include trans women will face a successful discrimination case from a man. But overall the judgment highlights the difficulties caused by having a new interpretation of the legislation which conflicts with the original policy and drafting intention. Hopefully the government will now take steps to set out clearly its policy on the treatment of trans people in our society and ensure the law reflects that.”The high court judgment is a significant boost for campaigners who have been growing increasingly frustrated at the slow pace of application of the ruling across the UK.Earlier this month ForWomenScotland, the gender-critical group that brought the original supreme court challenge, took the Scottish government to court again over guidance that trans prisoners should be housed according to individual risk assessment, which the group argues is contrary to last April’s ruling.Maya Forstater, the chief executive of the gender-critical campaign group Sex Matters, which intervened in the GLP case, said the UK government’s equalities minister, Bridget Phillipson, “should now lay the full EHRC code of practice for service providers before parliament without further delay”.UK ministers are still considering final guidance from the EHRC on new rules on how public bodies, businesses and other service providers should apply the supreme court ruling in practice.Last month,the Guardian was toldthat in a change in approach under Stephenson, the new rules were being adapted to lessen the impact on businesses and to ensure the guidance tries to balance single-sex spaces with the lives of transgender people.Explore more on these topicsUK supreme courtGenderTransgenderScotlandWomennewsShareReuse this content"

After the shooting on Wednesday, Canadian police identified the suspect as Jesse Van Rootselaar.Tumbler Ridge mapIn a statement to the Guardian, Roblox said: “We have removed the user account connected to this horrifying incident as well as any content associated with the suspect. We are committed to fully supporting law enforcement in their investigation.”The California-based company added that the “Mall experience” was accessible only through Roblox Studio, a separate app used by developers to create games. As a result, the simulator recorded just seven visits.Roblox also said it uses a combination of AI and a team of safety specialists to review content that is uploaded to its platform before it is shown to another user.Wednesday’s attack – one of Canada’s deadliest school shootings since the 1989 École Polytechnique massacre when a gunman killed 14 women – leftnine people deadin Tumbler Ridge, a small coalmining community.The victims included a teacher, five students, the suspect’s mother and her stepbrother. The suspect, who reportedly had a history of mental health issues, was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.This isn’t the first time Roblox has been criticised for its content. The platform allows its millions of users to create and share their own video games – many of them benign, featuring cartoon fish and campingtrips.However, it has also allegedly made Jeffrey Epstein-themed content available to children, and is facing alawsuitin California for facilitating the sexual exploitation and assault of minors.The links between violent video games and mass shootings have beenlong-debatedand remaininconclusive, with large studies finding at most a small correlation between gaming and real-world aggression.However, though games may not cause violence, recent incidents underscore the growing trend of “gamified violence”: extremists adopting elements of video game design in the context of real-world attacks.This is becomingincreasingly common. The attacker in the 2019 mosque shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, broadcast his massacre on Facebook. Aracially motivated shooting in Buffalo, New York, in 2022, was broadcast on Twitch, a platform that allows users to livestream themselves playing video games.This article was amended on 14 February 2026. An earlier version said there was more than one attacker in the Christchurch attack and incorrectly named the platform the attacker streamed on as Twitch.Explore more on these topicsTumbler Ridge school shootingCanadaAmericasGamesSoftwareRobloxAI (artificial intelligence)newsShareReuse this content"

The nine-day celebrations, the biggest holiday in China’s calendar, officially start on Sunday.While at the festive market, Xi picked up a 45 yuan (£4.79) bundle of delicacies from Daoxiangcun, a historic bakery known for its traditional snacks.According to the shopkeeper interviewed by Chinese media, Xi plumped for three items: honey-glazed dough twists, cream-filled dough twists and jujube flower pastries, a flakey, flower-shaped cookie with a filling made from red dates. Dough twists are made from fried pastry and are a popular local snack in Beijing.The shop has since been overrun by shoppers keen to get a slice of the Xi-approved pies.One customer, Zhao, bought 16 bags of the snacks, which are now being pre-packaged into Xi-themed triples. She told a reporter: “These are the same new year’s goods recommended by the general secretary, and people really like them. I want to buy some to give to my friends.”View image in fullscreenThe shop has since been overrun by shoppers keen to get a slice of the Xi-approved pies.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockXi is the general secretary of the Chinese Communist party (CCP), as well as being China’s president and thecommander of the armed forces.Daoxiangcun said its stores had to restock pastries to accommodate hungry and patriotic customers.Xi also visited a store called Yili Bakery and bought a 14 yuan loaf of fruit bread. He reportedly said that he had enjoyed Yili’s butter rolls as a child in Beijing’s hutongs, the traditional alleyways that crisscross the capital’s historic centre.Xi’s personal tastes have often inspired imitations. In 2022, there was aviral trendamong young people on social media of wearing “office and bureau style clothes”, ie the plain attire of a CCP bureaucrat, a tongue-in-cheek homage to the CCP’s highest-ranking cadre, the general secretary.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsXi JinpingChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

But it is not due to come into force until 2028, and sector experts have said the £500m set aside to pay for it will not be sufficient. The wider issue of how to fund social care is being reviewed by the cross-bench peer Louise Casey, who is not expected to report until the run-up to the next general election.Speaking on a panel at the Bristol festival of economics last year, Bell argued that rapid increases in the number of people coming into the countryoften reflect wider policy challenges.“It’s almost always that where there’s big immigration numbers, the problem is somewhere else in government not addressing an underlying problem,” he said.Bell’s appointment comes amid a wider refresh of the chancellor’s advisers. Neil Amin-Smith, once the violinist for the pop band Clean Bandit and now an economist, was recently made chair of her council of economic advisers, which is made up of political appointees rather than civil servants.Reeves said: “Through stability, investment and reform, this government has the right plan for our economy and the appointment of Prof Brian Bell will strengthen our economic leadership as we deliver for working people.”Explore more on these topicsEconomicsEconomic policyRachel ReevesPaySocial careImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

The CMA said it “did not consider this a reasonable excuse” and imposed the penalty in December 2025.In a statement, the regulator added that Euro Car Parks had taken the step of seeking a high court injunction to stop the company being named, but the application was refused earlier this week.Hayley Fletcher, the CMA’s senior director of consumer enforcement, said the information requests the company ignored were “essential tools that help us understand the facts and get to the bottom of potential infringements of the law. It is a legal obligation to comply … they are not optional.”By ignoring its multiple approaches the regulator said it had to expend extra time and resources to obtain the information.“This is the first time we’ve used our new powers to fine a company for failing to respond to such a notice,” said Fletcher. “It sends a clear message: firms that don’t reply to our requests or refuse to comply risk facing penalties like this one.”Due to the seriousness of the matter, the CMA fined Euro Car Parks 75% of the maximum possible fixed charge – a total of £473,000. Under its enforcement powers, the regulator can issue a fixed penalty of up to 1% of the company’s annual turnover for this type of breach.A number of drivers haveaccused Euro Car Parks of unfairly demanding money for supposed infringements of car park rules. But the CMA confirmed it did not have a consumer enforcement case open against the company and “no assumption should be made that it has infringed consumer law”.Explore more on these topicsCompetition and Markets AuthorityMotoringRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

And here he is, doing just that: played by the baritone Daisuke Ohyama, with the forces of Scottish Opera ranged around him.Over five acts,The Great Wavegives us episodes from Hokusai’s life and death, beginning with his funeral then continuing in flashback, including a dream sequence in which he encounters the wave that inspired his most famous print. As you might expect, it looks beautiful. The production is the work of an all-Japanese team headed by the director Satoshi Miyagi, and it’s full of Hokusai’s pictures, projected upon the bamboo walls of Junpei Kiz’s set, which reflect the artist’s barrel-shaped coffin. It often sounds beautiful, too: Fujikura uses the shakuhachi – a recorder-like flute, played by Shozan Hasegawa – as the basis for a light-infused soundworld conjuring openness and simplicity in almost Copland-esque style, made piquant with fluttering, elusive orchestral textures.View image in fullscreenEdward Hawkins,Daisuke Ohyama and Julieth Lozano Rolong in Scottish Opera’s The Great Wave.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/the GuardianEveryone begins wearing white – blank canvases – but Hokusai and Ōi, his daughter and helpmeet, gradually become soaked in the expensive Prussian blue pigment that, this being closed-off 19th-century Japan, must be obtained through forbidden trade with the dreaded Dutch. There’s no real jeopardy, though: we learn in passing that Hokusai’s house has burned down, and that he risks execution for trading with the Dutch, but none of these things trouble him. Even when a bunch of elegantly dancing heavies are poised to lop off the toes of his grandson, who has run up gambling debts, he goes on painting.So it’s less the retelling of a life story, more a series of extended vignettes, or a Philip Glass-style meditation. But on what? There’s a reason why there are so few successful stage works about successful artists. Hokusai is a happy man whose only wish is for a long life so that he can continue to develop his art. At more than one point – for example, when Hokusai is dashing off glorious animal pictures for a queue of fans – it feels like a discussion of the mechanics of giving the public what they want. As for Ōi, she’s an artist herself, a divorcee who has returned to her father’s house as his assistant – but if her feelings about this are even remotely mixed, we barely hear of it.View image in fullscreenBeautiful … Ohyama in The Great Wave.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/the GuardianVocally, Ōi is the star, andJulieth Lozano Rolongradiates her generous nature, singing in a glowing high soprano. There are strong performances, too, from the supporting cast, including Shengzhi Ren, doubling as Hokusai’s canny agent and a sweetshop owner wistfully remembering his favourite customer, and the sweet-sounding tenor Luvo Maranti as the pesky grandson. Conducted by Stuart Stratford, the orchestra and chorus play and sing with absolute conviction.Cash-strappedScottish Operahas been able to develop a project with funding attached and has run with it admirably. With an exhibition in the foyer and a programme book full of interesting essays, there’s a lot to be learned about Hokusai here.

And yet the standout star of Emerald Fennell’s new film isn’t one of its smouldering young lovers, played by Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, but British television’s most affable grump – Martin Clunes.Clunes plays Mr Earnshaw, the patriarch of the Earnshaw household whose decision to bring home a destitute young Heathcliff from Liverpool to the Yorkshire Moors sets in motion the destructive love story at the centre of Wuthering Heights. In Fennell’s reworking, Cathy’s elder brother, Hindley, is abolished entirely, with his cruelty, boozing and gambling folded into the father instead.“He’s rotten to the core,” Clunes told ITV’s This Morning recently. “He’s sort of drinking from the start. He’s a devout misogynist. He’s got a gambling addiction and is covered in vomit.”View image in fullscreenMargot Robbie as Cathy and Jacob Elordi as Heathcliffe in a scene from Wuthering Heights.Photograph: APIt is a far cry from the roles that have defined Clunes’s career, and one he has described as both “exciting” and “scary” – not least for the prospect of stepping on to a blockbuster film set. Critics, however, suggest the risk has paid off. “As a child, young Cathy Earnshaw is a pert miss, indulged by her roistering old twinkly eyed squire of a dad, in which role Martin Clunes pretty much pinches the whole film,”wrote the Guardian’s film criticPeter Bradshaw.Born in Wimbledon in 1961, Clunes is the nephew of the actor Jeremy Brett, famed for playing Sherlock Holmes in the Granada TV series, and the son of the actor Alec Clunes, who died when Clunes was eight. Clunes has spoken about having to suppress his grief as a child in the face of British stiffness. “The expectation was, ‘Oh, come on, let’s not cry. Let’s be grown up’,”he said last year. “How grown up can you be at eight?”Soon afterwards, Clunes was sent to Barfield boarding school in Surrey because his paternal grandparents feared growing up without a father figure would make him gay. “So then I had to not cry and not wet the bed at boarding school, which was just impossible,” he said.He drifted into acting, studying drama at the ArtsEd theatre school before working in repertory theatre. During a performance at Hampstead theatre, he was spotted by Harry Enfield, who cast him in his sketch shows and later recommended him for the role of Gary Strang in Simon Nye’s sitcom Men Behaving Badly. The beer-guzzling, woman-chasing Gary, played oppositeNeil Morrissey, made Clunes a household name and earned him a Bafta in 1996.View image in fullscreenClockwise from left: Neil Morrissey, Martin Clunes, Caroline Quentin and Leslie Ash in the 90s sitcom Men Behaving Badly.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyThe show was unmistakably of its time – Clunes has since described it as a “silly” and “zeitgeisty” series that got swept up in “that whole Loaded movement”.Throughout the 90s and early 2000s, Clunes worked steadily across film and television, appearing in Staggered, Lorna Doone, A is for Acid, Shakespeare in Love and Saving Grace, as well as leading roles in Goodbye, Mr Chips and the ITV comedy drama William and Mary.But his most defining role arrived in 2004 with Doc Martin, in which he played the curmudgeonly GP Dr Martin Ellingham. Running for 10 series across 18 years, the show established Clunes as a fixture of British television, and still attracts pleas from fans for a revival. Clunes, meanwhile, has insisted he is far sunnier than his onscreen counterpart. “I’ll go around trying to make everyone like me, unless they don’t deserve to like me,” heonce told the Guardian.View image in fullscreenMartin Clunes as the curmudgeonly GP Dr Martin Ellingham in Doc Martin.Photograph: ITV/Rex/ShutterstockIn recent years, he has appeared in Reggie Perrin, Arthur & George, Manhunt, Warren, and last year’s Out There, in which he played a widowed farmer who faces up to county lines drug dealers. Earlier in his career, he supplemented his acting income by modelling for Gilbert and George and voicing Safeway adverts, while also presenting travelogues, documentaries and writing books about his love of animals.Clunes lives in Dorset with his wife, the Doc Martin producer Philippa Braithwaite, five dogs, two cats, and a menagerie of horses and hens. The couple have one daughter, who is studying to be an equine vet. He has been lined up to portray the disgraced BBC presenter Huw Edwards in an upcoming factual drama, Power: The Downfall of Huw Edwards, charting the implosion of one of British television’s most recognisable figures.For now, though, Clunes finds himself improbably at the centre of one of the most talked about films of the year. And in a glossy, sexually charged literary adaptation, no one would have expected his “rotten” patriarch to leave one of the deepest impressions.Explore more on these topicsWuthering HeightsMartin ClunesTelevisionEmerald FennellEmily BrontëMargot RobbieJacob ElordifeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is a sombre tale of the American old west, adapted by Dusen from the novel by Stewart O’Nan, and somehow has the feel of a short film indulgently taken to feature length. Its visual gestures and set pieces, although striking and often shocking, felt for me disconnected from any emotional truth – a truth that sustained, developed storytelling may have provided.The setting is a frontier town in Wisconsin in 1870, and Jacob (Johnny Flynn) is both sheriff and pastor – although he wears neither badge nor religious garment. He has seen traumatising service in the civil war, in which he appears to have achieved high rank, although some in the town are suspicious of his Norwegian background. He is married to Marta (Kristine Kujath Thorp) and they have a young child.When the dead body of an itinerant drifter is discovered on the town’s outskirts, poignantly still in uniform from the war, it is a veritable return of the repressed for a place trying to get over that nightmare. The town’s careworn doctor (John C Reilly) is horrified to realise that this man died of diphtheria (bizarrely, and surely unhygienically, he examines the reeking corpse in his parlour) and a woman from a neighbouring religious community has the same symptoms.A catastrophic epidemic is imminent and the men are divided as to what to do. Should they declare an unenforceable lockdown-quarantine that would merely trigger a panicky exodus, spreading the disease far and wide? Or begin a secretive policy of non-acknowledgment, which might allow them, by stealth, to keep the illness and public order under control?But the disease is to render this dilemma irrelevant. Jacob is unable to be tough enough with people and to force them to obey his strictures. There are scenes of horror which are made worse, or at any rate more complicated, by news of a spreading wildfire – a quite separate pestilence, which creates an eerie red glow in the atmosphere. This glow could ambiguously be a PTSD projection, a dramatisation of Jacob’s already deeply unhappy mind. He seems immune to the disease. Is he a carrier? A Typhoid Mary?Reilly delivers his role with sympathy and weight; Flynn, though always a watchable screen performer, was perhaps not directed as closely as he might have been to create the necessary wrenching anguish. It is a highly controlled artefact of a film, but delivers less than it promises.A Prayer for the Dying screened at theBerlin film festival.Explore more on these topicsBerlin film festival 2026First look reviewWesternsPeriod and historical filmsJohn C ReillyJohnny FlynnFilm adaptationsBerlin film festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a film about music. Particularly, about what remains when a musician cannot play and is left to consider the terrible sacrifices made, without conscious consent, to this all-consuming vocation that creates family pain and jealousy almost as a toxic byproduct. It’s a drama to put you in mind of Glenn Gould and Hilary du Pré, sister of Jacqueline.Screenwriter Mark O’Halloran has adapted the2013 novel Intermission by Owen Martellabout renowned jazz pianist Bill Evans. It focuses on a period of emotional devastation for Evans, when no music was possible – perhaps a restorative intermission, perhaps the start of a calamitous new aridity – when his close friend and bassist Scott LaFaro was killed in a car crash in his 20s.The director is Grant Gee, who madethe wonderful documentary Innocence of Memoriesabout Orhan Pamuk. Cinematographer Piers McGrail has shot the film in a smoky high-contrast monochrome, switching to garish colour for three flashforward segments of 1973, 1979 and 1980; these show three other deaths, including Evans’s own, for each of which LaFaro was a kind of forerunner, and each attributable to his musical life.Anders Danielsen Lie plays Evans as a gaunt and distrait figure, his reticence intensified by grief; someone whose glasses are perched on a face almost too thin to support them, a smoker always apparently about to vanish into the gauze of cigarette smoke. He is a heroin addict, co-dependent with his girlfriend Ellaine Schultz (Valerie Kane); this is a habit that now has even more of a chance of destroying his life. His deeply concerned brother Harry (Barry Ward) comes to Bill’s chaotic New York apartment and asks him to stay with him, his wife and young daughter. But he soon decides that Bill’s mere presence is dangerous for his own precarious mental health and sends him away for a rest cure with their elderly parents, now living in sunny Florida, where the sunshine creates a whiteness that scorches out of the screen.His mother, Mary, is played by Laurie Metcalf, while Bill Pullman puts in a terrific performance as Evans’ genial, cantankerous dad; a garrulous old guy who drives his son around his sleek new neighbourhood (they hail from Plainfield, New Jersey), pleased as punch with his son’s prominence and his own prosperous leisure. At the wheel, he is given to faintly Rabbit Angstrom-esque monologues about the way the country is going: “Look at Kennedy. The Irish are taking over. But never any Welsh. It’s because we’ve never suffered. It is our punishment.”But the awful truth is that Bill’s brother, Harry Jr, and perhaps even his dad are envious of him – especially Harry Jr, who is a music teacher and would-be musician himself, excruciatingly aware of his own inferiority and subject, in any case, to depression and mental illness. Harry Jr is better than Bill at golf (his dad is also a big golfer) but this is no consolation.Harry Sr comes close to telling him how the working life that now pays for this laid-back new existence in Florida was a grim imprisonment. Perhaps he too wanted to be an artist, or just something other than what he was; something that would take an artist’s talent to imagine. But when Bill returns to New York he finds the old problems waiting for him, particularly his inability to build a meaningful relationship, and Kane conveys Ellaine’s terrible hurt. Gee thoroughly inhabits Evans’s world.Everybody Digs Bill Evans screened at theBerlin film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsBiopicsBill EvansJazzPeriod and historical filmsBerlin film festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

The esteemed film-maker was licking his wounds: his most recent picture,Far from the Madding Crowd, which imbued its 19th-century rural characters with an anachronistic King’s Road style and panache, had flopped stateside.Childers approached the date with mixed feelings. He adored Schlesinger’s previous movie, the jazzyDarling, starring Julie Christie as a model on the make, and had seen it three times.But he had heard the director described as “mercurial”. His solution was to take a friend along with him to the bar at the Beverly Wilshire hotel for backup. “I thought: This guy might be a total shit,” recalls Childers, now 81, on the phone from Palm Springs. “I told my friend, ‘Two kicks under the table means we’re out of here. One kick meansyou’reout of here.’”It didn’t take long for that solitary kick to come. “John was charming and witty, with these twinkling eyes. I knew I could handle this.” Once Childers’ friend departed, the two men weren’t alone for long. “The actor Lee Remick came by to speak to John. She had Frank Sinatra with her. ‘Pleased to meet you, Mr Sinatra ….’ I thought: This could be a really great life.” And it was: the pair were together until the director’s death in 2003 at the age of 77. To mark the centenary this month of Schlesinger’s birth, Childers is hosting a programme of the director’s work in Palm Springs, called My Husband Makes Movies. At the same time, the UK is getting its own touring season, The Consummate Professional:John Schlesingerat 100,, which aims to revive interest in the man behind the movies.View image in fullscreenX-rated … Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight in Midnight Cowboy.Photograph: MGMMost renowned among them, though not quite the best, isMidnight Cowboy. It was this adaptation of James Leo Herlihy’s novel that Schlesinger was preparing to direct when he and Childers met. From that first month together in 1967, any division between their personal and professional lives was negligible; if Schlesinger was making a film, Childers was part of its fabric. The director took his new lover with him to New York while he worked on Midnight Cowboy. “I said, ‘Is this some John Wayne western?’ He said, ‘Hardly, my dear. Read it.’” When Childers reached the final page of Waldo Salt’s script about a naive Texas hustler trying to make it in a seamy, salacious New York, he was agog. “It was the wildest thing I’d ever read. So ribald and X-rated.”View image in fullscreenSchlesinger’s partner, Michael Childers, in Palm Springs, 2008.Photograph: ZUMA Press, Inc./AlamyChilders helped to make it wilder still. For the sequence in the script which simply read “A party in Greenwich Village ensues”, he suggested staging the whole thing “like an Andy Warhol loft party”. Childers roped in the Warhol set – Viva, Joe Dallesandro, Paul Morrissey and others – to a shoot a scene that ended up taking three days, becoming ever more debauched. “Andy wanted to be in it, too,” he says casually, “but he’d just been shot.”Schlesinger’s early hat-trick – his 1962 kitchen-sink debut,A Kind of Loving, followed byBilly Liarand Darling – helped to facilitate and crystallise advances in British cinema in the first half of the 1960s. As the decade ended, Midnight Cowboy became one of the agents of Hollywood’s burgeoning radicalism and disinhibition. Dustin Hoffman, who played Joe Buck’s scuzzy sidekick Ratso Rizzo, was at a preview screening where “people walked out in droves” at the sight of a male student (played by an adorably goofy Bob Balaban) going down on Joe in a Times Square grindhouse. “We thought this could end everybody’s career,” Hoffman said.Instead, Midnight Cowboy won Schlesinger an Oscar for best director and became the first X-rated movie to bag the best picture prize. Its success paved the way forSunday Bloody Sunday, Schlesinger’s 1971 masterpiece about a love triangle among middle-class Londoners, with a bisexual artist (Murray Head) dividing his affections between a gay doctor (Peter Finch) and a divorcee (Glenda Jackson). Midnight Cowboy is a conflicted study of repressed homosexuality festering into violence – it could be a homophobic film, a film about homophobia, or both – whereas its follow-up was both more blase and more sophisticated. A kiss between Finch and Head is shown near the start of the film in stark, brightly lit closeup: no mollifying music, no cuts, no shame. “That kiss was going to be in closeup or not at all,” said Schlesinger. “I wanted it as big and as natural as any kiss that’s been on the screen.”View image in fullscreenSchlesinger directing Sunday Bloody Sunday.Photograph: MGMHe went on to enjoy commercial hits almost as big as Midnight Cowboy, such as the 1976 thriller Marathon Man, with its infamous scene of Hoffman being tortured in the dentist’s chair by Nazi fugitive Laurence Olivier. Schlesinger would even make a pair of films, written by Alan Bennett and concerning British traitors, which rivalled the eloquence of Sunday Bloody Sunday:An Englishman Abroad, with Alan Bates as Guy Burgess, andA Question of Attribution, starring James Fox as Anthony Blunt. Yet while his early movies are widely known and highly regarded (Midnight Cowboy was recently turned into a stage musical), the man himself is another matter. “The films are familiar but the name doesn’t ring a bell for people,” says Claire Nicolas, one of the producers of the UK season.John Schlesinger 1926-2003: a tribute to a man who defined British cinemaRead moreThe reasons are varied. Eclecticism may be partly to blame. A director whose résumé includes a scabrous study of Hollywood decadence and immorality (The Day of the Locust), a gentle wartime love story (Yanks) and a vulgar big-budget comedy featuring car crashes and a waterskiing elephant (Honky Tonk Freeway) will always be a challenge to pigeonhole or commodify. “I think he contained a few too many multitudes,” says Nicolas’s co-curator, Marc David Jacobs. “Luca Guadagnino is a great modern parallel. He’s another director who makes very different films, some of which click and some don’t. And without Sunday Bloody Sunday, you wouldn’t have a film like Challengers.”It’s easy enough to identify the hallmarks of individual movies but trickier to say what constitutes a typical Schlesinger film. They don’t have the identifiable visual or rhythmic imprint of Nicolas Roeg, who shot Far from the Madding Crowd before becoming a director himself. Schlesinger did possess a certain ad-agency predilection for clanging symbolism: the contrast between the hardships of the developing world and the casual profligacy of the western one is highlighted none too subtly in throwaway images in Darling and Sunday Bloody Sunday, while the notion of characters as helpless goldfish swimming in a bowl turns up first in Darling and again in the 1984 espionage thriller The Falcon and the Snowman, starring Sean Penn.View image in fullscreenJulie Christie in 1967’s Far from the Madding Crowd.Photograph: MGM/Studiocanal/AllstarEfforts to capture the director’s essence, though, tend toward the diffuse. “He has always been so in tune with life,” said Glenda Jackson. Julia Prewitt Brown, author ofThe Films of John Schlesinger, believes his films concern “the importance of survival, of just getting through the day and of trying to make the best of what one has”. Then again, you could say the same about The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.Some of the claims made in the UK season’s press release are debatable: though Schlesinger engages fully with his own Jewishness via Finch’s character in Sunday Bloody Sunday, it is difficult to agree that he holds the title of Britain’s greatest Jewish film-maker in a world where Mike Leigh exists. More understandable is the way Schlesinger’s pioneering LGBTQ+ representation has become a unifying thread in appreciation of his work, beginning with Malcolm (Roland Curram), the easy-breezy photographer in Darling, who cruises a waiter and is later whisked away on the back of his scooter.Even when the characters are scarcely more than extras, such as the muscle marys who pop up intermittently throughout Honky Tonk Freeway, they are at least conspicuous. Childers adopts an unforgiving approach to anyone who isn’t au fait with his late husband’s place in the queer landscape. “Sunday Bloody Sunday is one of the five most important gay pieces in the world,” he says. “I get furious when young gay people haven’t seen it. It’s part of their culture!”The director was relaxed and open about his sexuality. Bennett recounts in his diaries the story of Schlesinger receiving his CBE from Queen Elizabeth II, who had a brief struggle fitting the ribbon around his neck. “Now, Mr Schlesinger, we must try to get thisstraight,” she said – a remark that he chose to see, said Bennett, “as both a coded acknowledgment and a seal of royal approval”.View image in fullscreenSchlesinger on the set of The Falcon and the Snowman, 1985.Photograph: RONALD GRANTThis sits uneasily with the nine-minute film he made in 1991, known informally asJohn Major: The Movie, to promote the Conservative party, thereby doing his bit to help it to a surprise win at the next year’s general election (at which Schlesinger himself admitted to voting Tory). This assignment came a mere three years after the implementation of section 28, which outlawed the so-called “promotion” of homosexuality in schools and followed Margaret Thatcher’s complaint that children were being taught they had “an inalienable right to be gay”.Jacobs puts this down partly to contrarianism. “Growing up in a very leftwing atmosphere of film-making in Britain, he had some dissatisfaction with that. Also, 1992 was not a great year for Schlesinger’s career. And this was a paycheck, after all.” Indeed: while the Chariots of Fire director Hugh Hudson gave his equivalent services to Labour for nothing, Schlesinger was handsomely remunerated. This may be the reason not only for his hypocrisy in shilling for the Tories, but also for his late-career drift into hack-work. Few directors who enjoy such sustained early acclaim have gone on to make a comparable abundance of bad films.Luca Guadagnino is a great modern parallel: without Sunday Bloody Sunday, you wouldn’t have ChallengersSchlesinger was famous for his temper. “No one had a shorter fuse,” said Bennett, while an unnamed crew member likened him to “Zeus, flinging down the lightning bolts”. So how did he deal with his numerous flops? “Manic depression,” says Childers. “That wasnotfun.”The director got his biggest bruising on Honky Tonk Freeway, a costly 1981 disaster that hobbled him for ever in Hollywood. Later low-points include the 1987 ritual horror The Believers and his 2000 swansong,The Next Best Thing, starring Madonna and Rupert Everett but dismally bereft of either rom or com. “I begged John not to do that film,” Childers sighs. “I thought it was a load of shit. And it is. When Madonna tries to act, oh, it’s terrible.”Sean Penn believed Schlesinger’s talents were waning as far back as The Falcon and the Snowman –a shoot so fraught that actor and director were reduced to communicating through an intermediary even when standing only a few feet apart. “I just don’t think that John was on his game at that moment: I think he was getting safe,” said Penn.View image in fullscreenWith Alan Bates, on location for A Kind of Loving, 1962.Photograph: RONALD GRANTAfter Schlesinger’s death, Bennett observed that he “wasn’t by nature a journeyman film-maker, taking whatever came along, but was forced into this way of working by having three houses to keep up, one of them in Hollywood, and always leading quite an expensive life.” It could almost be the end of Darling, with Christie as the go-getting model seduced by fame, money and sex but finally imprisoned and defeated by the luxurious life she has woven around herself.Nicolas argues, though, that it is precisely these conflicts and disappointments that make the Schlesinger story so compelling and revealing. “He made these incredible award-winning classics but also some questionable pieces of work,” she says. “Understanding any director is about comprehending the whole career, the whole context, and what the failures say about them as much as the successes. With this season, we’re asking cinemas: ‘Don’t just book the award-winners. Look at the other films, too.’ Otherwise, what’s the point?”The Consummate Professional: John Schlesinger at 100 is at various UK venues until JuneExplore more on these topicsFilmJohn SchlesingerLuca GuadagninoLGBTQ+ rightsJohn MajorfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He wasn’t Thundercat then, he explains. He was still Stephen Bruner, bass player for hire, who had fetched up in what he calls a “stupid-as-hell, Rick James-level band” backing the venerable rapper, packed with Los Angeles jazz luminaries who would later contribute to Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly: Kamasi Washington, Josef Leimberg, Terrace Martin. Alas, their jazz chops were sometimes deemed surplus to requirements. At one point, while Bruner was playing an expansive bass solo on stage, Snoop sidled up to him and flatly announced: “Ain’t nobody told you to play allthat.”So perhaps it was in the spirit of horizon-broadening that Bruner took it upon himself to play Snoop the song St Alfonzo’s Pancake Breakfast, a knotty, marimba-heavy slice of jazz-rock from Zappa’s 1974 album Apostrophe, which switches time signatures three times in less than two minutes, and features lyrics about a man stealing margarine and urinating on a bingo card. “Yeah, I hit him with the rollercoaster,” Bruner chuckles. “He was smoking, and he almost ate his blunt, saying: ‘What thehellis going on?’ I said: ‘My sentiments exactly.’ I think I did a cartwheel after that and left the band:I played Snoop Dogg St Alfonzo’s Breakfast, my job is done here, I have no more work to do.” He thinks for a moment. “Or maybe I got fired: ‘Get out of here dude, you’re too weird.’ I forget. It was a great moment.”View image in fullscreenIn London, January 2026.Photograph: Ollie Tikare/The Guardian; Assistant: Eddie DaviesThis, it becomes apparent as we attempt to discuss his forthcoming fifth album, is a very Thundercat kind of anecdote, involving one of the impossibly eclectic cast of musicians he has worked with over his career: he is presumably the only person in history who can claim to have played with Ariana Grande andHerbie Hancock, and to have been in an early 00s boyband (No Curfew, briefly big in Germany) and the gnarly thrash metal institution Suicidal Tendencies. You get the impression he wasn’t terribly happy as a member of the former: “I’m a working-class musician, man, and that was what it meant for me at the age of 14”. He spent nine years in the latter, however, powering his way through songs called Widespread Bloodshed and We’re F’n Evil. (It’s worth noting that he was also working with Erykah Badu at the same time.)View image in fullscreenPlaying with the thrash-metal band Suicidal Tendencies at Hammerfest, Prestatyn, in 2010.Photograph: Metal Hammer/Future/Getty ImagesHe looks puzzled when I ask if he can think of any musical situation in which he would feel uncomfortable playing. “Whatever brain disposition that lets you know you’re in a dangerous situation, I don’t think I have,” he says, shrugging. “I think constantly performing has allowed that to not be such a problematic thing to me. What’s that saying? ‘Luck is just preparation met with opportunity’?”In addition, the Snoop story also involves a dramatic and improbable collision of genres, very much Thundercat’s stock in trade. He says his transition from multipurpose sideman to solo artist in the early 2010s felt strangely natural to him, maybe because the music he started making was as strange and eclectic as the list of artists on his CV. His solo albums to date have piloted a wildly zigzagging path between funk, jazz-fusion, electronic pop, yacht rock, hip-hop, psychedelia, punk and chiptune, among other things, all of it lavishly decorated with the kind of extravagant bass solos that so upset Snoop Dogg.It shouldn’t really work, but it does, perhaps because the bizarre stylistic cocktails never seem forced, but a natural extension of his impossibly catholic tastes. Over the course of our afternoon, he goes from enthusing wildly about Leon Ware’s mid-70s masterpiece of sophisticated soulMusical Massage, to explaining theLydian mode, to demonstrating a clearly encyclopaedic knowledge of the work of Chick Corea, to earnestly discussing the “really innovative” oeuvre of Limp Bizkit. He thinks his musical tastes are down to his parents, both musicians – his dad drummed with the Temptations – and ardent believers that categorising music was just a marketing tool, an idea that clearly seeped in on a very deep level. By the time he was a teenager, he was as enamoured of Slipknot andKornas he was of theBilly CobhamandGeorge Dukealbums his parents played, or the jazz artists he and Washington were sneaking in, underage, to see in LA clubs.Clearly Thundercat is a pop star unlike any other, although you don’t need to know his backstory to work that out: you just have to look at him. Today in London, despite having recently landed from LA, he is dressed in typically head-turning style: voluminous corduroy trousers, shirt featuring a kind of 19th-century military brocade, trainers decorated with metallic skeleton toes, and dip-dyed dreadlocks held back from his face by a pair of enormous silver grips featuring snarling tigers. Perhaps worried that this might look insufficiently arresting, he has accessorised with a huge metallic breastplate bearing the logo of the cartoon alien felines from whom he took his name. He is an obsessive fan of cartoons, comic books and science fiction and peppers his conversation with references to manga and video games, a couple of them so obscure that I have to look them up when I get home.Whatever brain disposition that lets you know you’re in a dangerous situation, I don’t think I haveHe tells me that his “greatest moment ever” was getting a cameo role as a man with a robotic hand in the Star Wars TV seriesThe Book of Boba Fett. “I can use that in an argument every time somebody gets too high and mighty: ‘Hey, you can’t talk to me like that, I was in Star Wars!’” he nods. “It wasn’t one of those never meet your heroes moments. You can’t ruin Star Wars for me. Certain characters and certain principles it was created off are timeless, they still stand. The struggle between dark and light, what is considered dark and what is considered light; the Force, which is like flatulence basically.” He notes my baffled expression and smiles. “It’s all about how you choose to use it, man. Maybe as a weapon.”View image in fullscreenStephen Bruner as the Modifier in The Book of Boba Fett.Photograph: Capital Pictures/AlamyBut he hasn’t stopped off in London to discuss Star Wars. Bruner has a new album, Distracted, which seems to be head-spinning business as usual: smooth soft-rock piano ballads abut house tracks, A$AP Rocky raps over a beat that owes as much to shoegaze as to hip-hop, while both Lil Yachty and defiantly retro indie duo the Lemon Twigs are also in the supporting cast.Not for the first time in his career, the eclecticism is so diverting that it’s initially easy to miss how fraught and downcast a lot of the songs are:2011’s The Golden Age of Apocalypsemourned the drug-related death of his friend and collaborator Austin Peralta; his 2017 breakthrough Drunk probed his problematic relationship with alcohol, while Distracted’s predecessor,It Is What It Iswas consumed with grief over the death of his “best friend”, rapperMac Miller.I’ve heard putting out an album being compared to postpartum depressionHe says It Is What It Is was particularly difficult to make – “There was a lot of trauma linked to it, a lot of pain” – compounded by the fact that it was released at the height of lockdown. “I’ve heard putting out an album being compared to postpartum depression – you have such an attachment to this thing because of how much you obsess about it, then you put it out and then there’s this kind of weird feeling of loneliness. And because of fucking Covid, It Is What It Is came out to complete silence, like: drop the album and go sit in darkness, see if you can amp the pain up some more.“There was a lot going on at the time that album came out, and just having to sit with it, I couldn’t … I would almost, like, vomit at the thought of it. But ultimately, when I look back, I’m very grateful for the chance to have sat down, because to have to go on stage and deal with it night after night, say goodbye to my friends over and over again, would have been another traumatising experience.”View image in fullscreenThundercat at FYF Fest 2017 in Los Angeles.Photograph: Rich Fury/Getty ImagesInstead of touring, Bruner took stock. He gave up drinking and took up boxing training with such dedication that “even my trainers wonder what the hell I’m doing sometimes: ‘Hey, are you training for a fight or something?’” He gives a mordant chuckle. “I’m like, ‘You mean world war three, because that seems to be on?’”He says the new album is “a bit of a diary, my thought processing”, and it seems to relate to the soul-searching he did in the aftermath of the release of It Is What Is. There are songs about his capacity for self-sabotage, about failed relationships, about his suspicion that some of his more erratic behaviour might be the result of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, although he isn’t diagnosed. “I think that it’s a byproduct of the environment, as most sicknesses are,” he says. “We got cell phones, we got microtransactions, you use your brain in 30-second bursts, and you’re going to adjust to that even if you don’t want to. And even if it was something you could get diagnosed, it’s like, I’m 40 years old, and I didn’t die so far. And I know not one creative person whose brain isn’t of that nature. It comes with the territory. So I guess it’s somewhere along the lines of a superpower.”The album also returns to the late Miller, who appears on She Knows Too Much, a track the pair recorded in Malibu some years before Miller’s death. No, Bruner says, it wasn’t weird returning to the recording and hearing his late friend’s voice booming around the studio again. The tracks that address Miller’s death on It Is What It Is were consumed by an almost paralysing misery: “So hard to get over it, I tried to get under it, I’m stuck in between,” he sang on the title track.View image in fullscreen‘Stand still too long, somebody’s going to hit you with something’ …Thundercat.Photograph: Ollie Tikare/The Guardian; Assistant: Eddie DaviesBut She Knows Too Much – a buoyant funk-fuelled track that finds Miller in his first flush of mega-fame, reflecting on his new celebrity in witty, earthy terms – offered a reminder of when they made it. “It was the funniest shit ever,” says Bruner. “It was hilarious, I remember it viscerally. I like to describe Mac almost like he was a one-man Rat Pack. When I would see him, I would somehow feel like we were supposed to be wearing suits. Like weird, highbrow bullshit and shenanigans. And tomfoolery! That’s what we were up to. It’s just a clear picture of who we were.”‘It’s dark in the US right now. But I turn on a light, you know?’: Mavis Staples on Prince, Martin Luther King and her 75-year singing careerRead moreBruner says Distracted is “the sound of me choosing happy”. If it occasionally sounds troubled or downcast, well, “choosing happy is a hell of a process”.And, indeed, he does seem happy, joking about his new album having to compete with Cardi B – “I got to get myself a fatter ass, I got to get a BBL” – enthusing about a forthcoming visit to Paris fashion week.It’s weird, he says: for all the changes that his career has gone through, it doesn’t feel that different from his early days when he was playing weddings or, later, in Suicidal Tendencies. “My main memory is thinking if I stood still for too long, I’d get hit with a beer can. I think the same principle applies. Actually, I think that principle applies to every stage of life: stand still too long, somebody’s going to hit you with something.”With that, he shakes my hand and heads off into the London dusk, breastplate clanking a little as he goes, heads understandably turning as he passes.Distracted is released 3 April on Brainfeeder. The single I Did This to Myself (ft Lil Yachty) is out now. Thundercat’s UK tour begins 25 March at Brixton Academy"

Her drums swing loose and jazzy over heavy 808s; synths drift dreamily before snapping into gritty guitar riffs. Writing, producing and arranging all her own work, she weaves together neo-soul silk, R&B groove, indie edge, and flashes of grunge, all carried by a buttery falsetto that nods to Aaliyah, Amy Winehouse, Janet Jackson and early Destiny’s Child.Born in north-west London to a Nigerian father raised on Motown and gospel, and a Trinidadian-Indian mother spinning calypso and funk, Natanya began learning classical piano at the age of four. She grew up absorbing church bands, the fruits of YouTube rabbit holes, wrestling entrance themes, and late-night bedroom beats made on whatever gear she could get her hands on.Her 2023 debut EP Sorrow at Sunrise read like torn-out diary pages, filled with raw heartbreak and uni life confessions layered over lush, experimental production. In 2025, she swung bigger with Feline’s Return and its Act II extension, pairing bolder pop instincts with soulful depth.Cosigns from SZA, Tyler, the Creator, Doechii and Janet Jackson show she’s turning heads as she’s carving out her own lane.

Converge’s 2001 breakthrough Jane Doe remainsthemasterpiece of the genre’s pre-bastardisation days: vicious as a pit bull, yet played by men unafraid to test the limits, as evidenced by the tormented, 11-minute title track. The New Englanders have never rested on their laurels, either, with subsequent releases emphasising different shades of their trademark anarchy.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Love Is Not EnoughThe band’s 10th album and first in nine years (Chelsea Wolfe collaboration Bloodmoon: I not included), Love Is Not Enough condenses their carnage, intricacies and emotional pangs into their shortest-ever run time. Distract and Divide and To Feel Something are incensed and tightly arranged, as if Napalm Death and Slayer had joined forces to strangle you through the speakers.There’s much more than anger to this 30-minute onslaught. We Were Never the Same unloads pure adrenaline with its tapping guitar melody, whereas Beyond Repair is an ominous interlude that makes the snare strikes of follow-up track Amon Amok hit like a rugby tackle. Make Me Forget You stabs with devastation rather than physical rage, with Jacob Bannon screaming in anguish over a whirring riff.It’s rare for a metal band to still sound fresh this long after forming, and even rarer when they’ve spent almost all of their career in one subgenre. But Converge have a seemingly bottomless well of inspiration. Masters of metalcore, in 2001 and 2026 alike.Explore more on these topicsMetalPop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Made up of seven dense and distorted instrumentals, the record is the California-based Aymara musician’s attempt at capturing the energy of ceremonial music – not some rosy, polished version, but how it might sound recorded on a phone, clipping and all.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for AnataThe concept might sound bizarre, but for fans of JCC, it makes total sense. His music, often self-released and proudly unmastered, is characterised by its murky textures and amp-blasting volume. He took this rudimentary approach to the max with last year’s collaborative project Los Thuthanaka, alongside his sibling Chuquimamani-Condori, which was splattered with cartoonish vocal samples, whistles and syncopated rhythms. Here he returns to his solo formula, with just guitar, bass and a few Andean instruments. You’d call it stripped-back if it wasn’t so noisy.Opening track Chakana Head-Bang! throws the listener right into the deep end as a foggy drum beat crashes into a storm of feedback and then a jagged rock riff. Noise blasts through the album, anchored by looping, hypnotic melodies. Occasionally, you can lock into a groove, as in Ch’uwanchaña ~El Golpe Final~, where the jagged rhythm echoes the jauntiness of Andean folk music, or in Mallku Diablón, beefed up by thebombo italaquedrum.Amid the noise are pockets of warmth. Sometimes, JCC’s rhythm guitar is so rich and soaring, it sounds celestial. The effect is especially evocative on Convocación “Banger/Diffusion”, where the distortion suddenly clears into a woozy reversed guitar loop. Even at their loudest and most scrappy, the tracks conjure up a wistful feeling, which only intensifies over repeat listens. It confirms JCC’s theory about the meditative capacities of loudness, articulated in a recent interview: “It’s not supposed to be painful, but it’s supposed to change you, it’s supposed to make you feel healed in some way.”Also out this monthThe Black Hill, the Glass Sky is a new compilation by Glasgow DIY labelSomewhere Pressthat enlists musicians from the city and beyond to respond to a poem exploring Scottish folklore and terrain. Among these 11 excellently curated contributions, there are droning soundscapes, avant folk experiments and shades of dream pop, plus a striking murder ballad recital from Dylan Kerr. It’s a thrilling and evocative listen. Unnoticed (Ransom Note) is the latest release from Dutch experimental musician and Plus Instruments founding memberTruus de Groot. As you might expect from her genre-bending, five-decade career, there’s lots going on – sometimes to a fault – as it jackknifes between eerie modular ditties and 80s-inspired club rhythms, scattered with speak-sing vocals and strange sounds. Copenhagen groupRayakitamake their debut with a self-titled set of atmospheric, mostly instrumental compositions (Macadam Mambo). Combining the tranquility of ambient with the gentle kick of downtempo dance music – all filtered through a psychedelic haze – it’s the ideal Ibiza chill-out room soundtrack.Explore more on these topicsMusicExperimental album of the monthExperimental musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Nowhere House was in a remote American mountain valley; when it burned down, the terrible crimes committed by Hollywood star Leaf Winham against young men were revealed. Subsequently, runaway children turned the valley into a fortress, surviving on food they could catch or grow, with occasional forays into the towns below. Riley has heard the rumours, but it is only when she sees a green-clad boy – or is it a girl? – hovering outside her bedroom window offering directions on how to find Nowhere that she realises this might be her chance to escape and save her little brother from their sadistic guardian. Her experiences are interwoven with stories from others drawn there: Marc, a journalist determined to get inside the fortress; Adam, the only one of Leaf’s victims to survive; the pioneers who built the first house in the valley, and more. A dark, grimly compelling and very twisty tale.View image in fullscreenPagansby James Alistair Henry (Moonflower, £9.99)In this entertaining alt-history debut, we are in a 21st-century Britain where the Norman conquest never happened, split along religious and cultural lines. The Saxons are led by the High King, who rules the greater part of England; Scotland is behind a wall, allied to the Nordic Economic Union; and the indigenous Celts are second-class citizens. In the buildup to a London summit to discuss plans for British unity, a Celtic negotiator is found dead, nailed to a tree in Epping Forest. Detective Captain Aedith Mercia of the London police teams up with Drustan of the Dumnonian tribal police in a search for what seems to be a religiously motivated serial killer; they find evidence there could be a greater political threat. It’s a great read, combining clever world-building with engaging characters and an exciting story, and ending with a promise of more to come.Pedro the Vastby Simón López Trujillo, translated by Robin Myers (Scribe, £9.99)This short, intense novel by an award-winning Chilean author is speculative fiction about an ominous change to human life as we know it in the wake of ecological destruction. Four forestry workers are struck by a fungal infection affecting their brains. The sole survivor wakes from a coma; speaking with a new voice about being part of a greater whole rather than one sinful individual, he is declared a prophet by a religious cult. Told through alternating viewpoints, moving between conscious and unconscious experience, from the daily lives of an impoverished rural family to a scientist investigating fungal life, it is an unsettling, hallucinogenic trip that lingers in the mind.View image in fullscreenOperation Bounce Houseby Matt Dinniman (Michael Joseph, £22)The colony planet of New Sonora was originally settled by convicts and political dissidents; now their adult grandchildren are hard-working farmers on the brink of a new era as the opening of a Transfer Gate above the planet will allow instant travel between New Sonora and Earth. Our hero, young Oliver Lewis, learns that an eviction order has been served on the planet, and action planned to eliminate any “terrorists” remaining. A variety of war machines arrive, but no soldiers. The government has outsourced planet clearance to a company that manufactures video games: the killing machines will be controlled by excited young gamers back on Earth. The farmers now designated as targets have no weapons; they can only reprogramme their agricultural drones for protection and try to convince the people of Earth that they’re just like them. An entertaining story that skewers an uncomfortable aspect of today’s world: “Imagine a war where all the soldiers are actually paying money for the chance to fight in it. It’s brilliant.”A Beast Slinks Towards Beijingby Alice Evelyn Yang (Dead Ink, £11.99)This debut novel from a Chinese American writer uses a magical-realist lens to examine some of the darker strands of 20th-century Chinese history and the legacy of generational trauma. Qianze has had no contact with her father since he abandoned the family on her 14th birthday. When he turns up 11 years later, babbling about a prophecy, she is horrified, but compelled to be the “good Chinese daughter” and take care of him. Eventually, he reveals her family’s hidden history, and not only does he recall his own shameful experiences as a child during Mao’s Cultural Revolution, he’s able to channel the memories of his parents from years before he was born. Beautifully written, the novel seamlessly blends elements of the supernatural with everyday life, creating a powerful multitonal tale of cruelty, pain, love and survival.Explore more on these topicsBooksScience fiction roundupFantasy booksHorror booksScience fiction booksreviewsShareReuse this content"

Snippets of gossip expose the divisions in a migrant community in this polyphonic portrait of contemporary AmericaLucy AtkinsFri 13 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleThere has been debate lately about whether novels should cater for our cauterised attention spans. If that means narratives constructed in short chunks that can be consumed in five-minute bursts on a phone – intelligent, but with plenty of cliffhangers and well-timed packets of information to keep us coming back – then Good People ticks all the boxes.Patmeena Sabit’s debut is constructed from a chorus of short testimonies – none more than a few pages, some just a few lines – about the death of Zorah Sharaf, an Afghan American teenager who has drowned in a canal at the wheel of the family car. We hear from family, friends and those in the wider community – neighbours, teachers, schoolmates, journalists, the guy who found the body – as well as those involved in the investigation (though very little from the police), and bites of media commentary. A picture slowly forms of a devastated family, but what kind of family was it? Versions are multiple and contradictory. The Sharafs are perfect, loving, tight-knit. They are dangerously dysfunctional.The novel is, in essence, a crime mystery in which a community turns detective and puts a grieving family on trial. It is also a sharp portrait of an immigrant community in the modern United States, an anatomy of poisonous gossip and a commentary on wider societal divisions. Most of all, though, it is awfully addictive.We learn, from all these snappy voices and snippets, that Zorah’s parents, Rahmat and Maryam, arrived in the US from Kabul in the late 1990s with nothing. They had four children: Zorah, her older brother, and two much younger siblings. Rahmat worked night and day, and weathered several business failures before his cleaning enterprise took off. He is now a multimillionaire entrepreneur in international imports and fast food franchises; they are living the American dream in an upmarket Virginia neighbourhood. But success sparks envy, and money cannot erase cultural tensions. It is not simple for these devoted, obsessive parents to honour their community, culture and values while raising modern American teenagers who will fit in at high school, and – most importantly – Ivy League colleges.I wolfed down Good People in two sittings – it kept me stimulated, never bored, though not really nourished eitherSome of the narrative voices return repeatedly, but they never fully individuate – that isn’t the point. Their heft is collective. They sway us this way and that, presenting new information, judgments, contradictions, hints, revelations, questions and, of course, verdicts. The Sharafs are kind, supportive parents. No, they are harsh and punitive – basically child abusers. Zorah’s big brother was her best friend. No, he was a weirdo, a loner, her worst enemy. Everyone agrees that Zorah was beautiful, smart and popular; her girlfriends were always welcomed in the Sharaf household for sleepovers. But Zorah was never allowed to sleep at their houses, or go to parties, or on school trips, or to spend time with, let alone date, boys. The cultural dissonance builds, as does the pressure. Zorah starts skipping high school, faking report cards. Then she meets an unsuitable boy.We never hear directly from Zorah, her parents or siblings, but they begin to feel very real as we see their love for one another, their courage and resilience, as well as their fears and tensions. The narrative device allows Sabit to manipulate the reader wildly: a contradiction is timed to destabilise, a new perspective brings whiplash and we become complicit because we too pass judgment, piece half facts together, suspect, critique – condemn. But there are also times when the form is overstretched. Do we really need so much from a forensic meteorologist on Fulton County rainfall, a road safety specialist explaining the danger of hydroplaning or the Speedy Stop gas attendant?The most intriguing thing about Good People is not its polyphonic structure but the growing sense of an organising consciousness reeling back and forth between loving loyalty and rage: love for the complex Afghan community that is capable of generosity, care and support; fury at the judgment and misogyny, the violence, the absolutism. This fluctuating energy is compelling because it feels entirely true.How did Zorah end up in the canal? Did the Mercedes spin out of control on a wet road at night? Or is this something heinous, a so-called “honour killing”, father or brother – or maybe a jealous member of the Afghan community – punishing a young woman for stepping out of her box? Sabit toys with us, shoving us this way and that until the need for an answer feels really urgent. Gratification, however, is elusive. What follows is a mild deflation.Good People’s structure is both its strength and its greatest limitation. The narrative feeds us, morsel after morsel, so we never have to work too hard; and while there is stimulating cultural commentary, the structure prevents any deeper emotional, interior journey of character. I wolfed down Good People in two sittings. It kept me stimulated, educated and definitely not bored, though not really nourished either – but that, of course, is how we live now. People, good and bad, are going to love it.Good People by Patmeena Sabit is published by Virago (£16.99). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Savage and sweet and entirely strange, The Shitheads transports us back tens of thousands of years, to a time when survival required good aim with your hand axe, and squeamishness would not serve you well.Early humans Clare (Jacoba Williams, slippery and wild) and Greg (Jonny Khan, puppyishly excitable) meet on the hunt for an elk (a beautiful raggedy creature designed by Finn Caldwell and captained by Scarlet Wilderink, absolutely alive – until it is not). Never having met anyone like the other, they are both in awe of their opposing perceptions of time and the future, of living and dying. Worthy of a licked thumb.David Byrne and Aneesha Srinivasan direct with a thirst for blood and a delight in playful, prehistoric oddity. Interactions between characters are wide-eyed and primal, a sense of wonder accompanying their blunt peculiarities. With chatty, often simplified speech, Nicholls builds a world reliant on spears and seeds while encapsulating the grandness of what it means to dream, to listen and to fight for your survival.View image in fullscreenBeautifully raggedy … the elk puppet in The Shitheads.Photograph: Camilla GreenwellClare has grown up in a cave protecting her eager little sister Lisa, who if left to hunt anything larger than a rabbit would be flattened in seconds (played with bounding energy by Annabel Smith), and their father (Peter Clements, wonderfully menacing), an ailing man who has built his girls’ worlds on myths of the other, “shithead” people outside. They can’t talk, he says. They’re stupid. Their dreams become yours, he says, if you eat them. But here is Greg, telling Clare a story and dismantling her reality. And here comes Danielle (Ami Tredrea, rugged and wary), Greg’s partner, climbing down into Clare’s cave.Choosing wild imagination over accuracy, Anna Reid’s design artfully merges red-dust cave paintings with armchairs and lamps, and bones dangling down as decoration. The story seems to escape the confines of this stony home, grandeur demanded of its gruesomeness. Discovered through the Royal Court’s Open Submissions scheme, The Shitheads demonstrates the joy of greater risks being taken on our stages. The end would benefit from a trim, but this feral story soars with untamed life.At theRoyal Court theatre, London, until 14 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreRoyal Court theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

He now comes home to the UK; literally with this four-show residency at Alexandra Palace in London, and also in the musical homages he pays on the opening night.In succession, Gibson plays Arctic Monkeys’ When the Sun Goes Down, a techno mix of EsDeeKid’s 4 Raws, and a blend from Spice’s dancehall track So Mi Like It to the Chariots of Fire theme over a drum’n’bass beat – comedy patriotism, but very enjoyable for it, and all showing absolute disregard for any sense of purism in electronic music.He begins his five-hour set at 5.30pm, interspersing his own discography with back-to-back sets with Hamdi, Oppidan and Nia Archives. It’s not the euphoric “hug-the-stranger-next-to-you” of his Actual Life albums; it’s dark, heavy jungle and UK garage. Gibson’s love of London rap, from drill to conscious, is then made clear with a series of star guests: on new track Lights Burn Dimmer, Jamie T would make Mike Skinner proud; Berwyn delivers a braggadocious BerwynGesaffNeighbours; Blanco gets lost in himself on Solo.Later, jazz quintet Ezra Collective are joined by Argentine hip-hop duo Ca7riel and Paco Amoroso for a triumphant, pulsating performance of Beto’s Horns. Gibson’s production feels like a skeleton key for these collaborators, unlocking their best work: the sometimes impassive Headie One is energised and excitable on Smoke, Back to Basics and Ain’t It Different.In-demand producer Fred again.. : ‘I was fortunate not to be good at anything else’Read moreLondon is the natural home for Gibson’s garage and drum’n’bass tracks, but the more introspective and tender Adore U, Danielle (Smile on My Face) and a mix of Dermot Kennedy’s For Island Fires and Family and Lost, into Dermot (See Yourself in My Eyes), are some of the best received.At the outset, to prevent people filming instead of dancing, members of the audience were given stickers to put on their phone cameras – which lasted all of five seconds. Regardless, the charming and energetic Fred Again ensures everyone stays in the moment.Fred Again playsAlexandra Palace, London, on 13, 26 and 27 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsFred AgainDance musicElectronic musiclive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Everything and everyone becomes a ruin eventually. Entropy, the tendency of order to decay into chaos, is a fact of physics as well as everyday experience. But in the past, as now, the shiny and new was often valued above the timeworn: old churches were destroyed in the Renaissance, for instance, to make way for bigger, “better” ones. This painting shows how in the 18th century that attitude was turned upside down. For the first time, broken old buildings were cherished as atmospheric, picturesque wonders. Guardi is so in love with ruins that he invents one, imagining a crumbled, partly collapsed medieval abbey or palace against a blue Italian sky. When was it built, who lived here? He invites you to imagine this architecture’s glorious past while savouring the melancholy beauty of its present.National Gallery, LondonSign up to the Art Weekly newsletterIf you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email,please sign up here.Get intouchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailnewsletters@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsArt and designArt Weekly newsletterPaintingPhotographyArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now a new exhibition shows these flashes of inspiration in all their intimate gloryDale Berning SawaFri 13 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 13 Feb 2026 11.09 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleAt home one evening in 1951,Lucian Freuddid three drawings of fellow artist Francis Bacon. The biographer William Feaver recounts the anecdote as Freud told it to him: Bacon had stood up, undone the buttons on his trousers, rolled up his sleeves and wiggled his hips a little, saying: “I think you ought to do this, because I think that’s rather important.”By Freud’s own admission, the older painter was provocative in more ways than just this pose: “I got very impatient with the way I was working. It was limited and a limited vehicle for me,” Freud told Feaver. He felt his drawing stopped him from freeing himself, he said, “and I think my admiration for Francis came into this. I realised that by working in the way I did I couldn’t really evolve. The change wasn’t perhaps more than one of focus, but it did make it possible for me to approach the whole thing in another way.”Trace with your eye the curves and precision of those three line drawings and “limited” is the very last adjective that springs to mind. They are magnificent. What Freud’s comments belie is the tireless striving that lends all his work such power.He’s finding things out, he’s exploring, and it’s a quicker route with a pencil or charcoal than the whole oil spectrumThis trio are among the 175 paintings and works on paper at the National Portrait Gallery’s exhibitionLucian Freud: Drawing into Painting. Drawing, for Freud, was many things. It was how he wrote letters as a kid, how he broke in canvases (a rough ghostly image that would disappear under the paint), solved problems (going to the National Gallery late at night to look at specific works), and painted without paint (all those meaty etchings from the 1980s onwards). It was also often what he did after he had, as his former assistant David Dawson puts it, “painted himself out of a painting”. Curator Sarah Howgate points to several pen-and-inks and charcoals on paper that relate to Large Interior, W11 (after Watteau), that monumental canvas he did between 1981 and 1983. Many of the drawings, Howgate says, “were a response to the finished painting; they weren’t preparatory workings out”.Dawson, who worked for Freud from the early 1990s and is the last person of whom he made a portrait, says that drawing after the fact was about the artist’s unending quest for a direct line from the heart to the eye to the hand to the canvas: “He’s finding things out, he’s exploring, and it’s a quicker route to explore with a pencil or charcoal than the whole oil spectrum.”It is also the most exacting. “He always said you can never lie with drawing,” says Dawson. “Whereas with paint, it’s such an attractive medium, you can slightly smudge things, if you cut corners – which he never did, but youcan. You can fake it a bit with paint. You can’t with drawing.”Lucian Freud: Drawing Into Paintingisat the National Portrait Gallery, London,to 4 May.Pencilled in: five images from the exhibitionPortrait of a Young Man, 1944 (main picture)Howgate highlights the directness of artist John Craxton’s gaze here, and the incredible detail in Freud’s rendering of the man’s hair, the weave of his jacket, the soft folds of his cravat. His use of white chalk on coloured paper recalls Ingres, and art historian Herbert Read’s assessment of Freud as “the Ingres of existentialism”View image in fullscreenBella in her Pluto T-Shirt (etching), 1995.Photograph: © The Lucian Freud Archive.

I think that’s less the case with Lucian.” Freud spoke often of his subject’s inner life being important. They weren’t just blanks for him to fill in. Instead, he made their private universes tangible.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: National Portrait Gallery, London/The Lucian Freud Archive/Bridgeman ImagesSolicitor’s Head, 2003Freud would work standing less than a metre from where his subject was variously lying on the bed, or on the floor, or seated on a chair, and, says Dawson, “he’d come up really close to you, like, really close”. If his process was very internalised, you were aware of his nervous anxiety. “It wasn’t relaxed. And that kept you as a sitter slightly on edge because he didn’t quite know … He was battling with himself every day.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: The Lucian Freud Archive/Bridgeman ImagesDavid Hockney, 2002Included in the exhibition are a selection of paintings that show the dialogue between Freud’s works on paper and on canvas. For this portrait, Hockney would walk through Holland Park to see Freud and sit “for 120 hours, as he loves to say,” says Howgate. He did a drawing of Freud, too, which is also in theNational Portrait Gallerycollection, but, as Dawson puts it, Freud only gave David 45 minutes “and then walked out”.Explore more on these topicsLucian FreudArtExhibitionsNational Portrait GalleryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And so, in Jonathan Lynn’s elegiac swansong for his well-loved sitcom duo, Hacker calls upon his old consigliere Sir Humphrey to rescue him from trouble one last time.View image in fullscreenSpirited support … Stephanie Levi-John in I’m Sorry, Prime Minister.Photograph: Johan PerssonLynn (who wrote the original with the late Antony Jay) directs too, alongside Michael Gyngell, a production first staged in 2023at the Barn in Cirencester. Its ambition, as Hacker’s care worker Sophie telegraphs by quotingShelley’s Ozymandias, is to examine the mighty once they have fallen. Whither Hacker and Sir Humphrey, now exiled from the corridors of power, hanging on to a world they now barely understand? The latter is condemned to a care home, indeed, by his “evil queen” daughter-in-law. There is poignancy in that, but it’s not dwelled upon in a show that majors not in depth of feeling, far less dramatic incident, but in urbane wit and the illicit thrill of hearing old codgers say inappropriate things.At its worst, it’s less a play than a vehicle for Lynn and his characters to discourse, not very insightfully, on trigger warnings and safe spaces. Stephanie Levi-John does spiritedly in the thankless role of Sophie, forever correcting her elders’ improprieties. Rhys Jones and Clive Francis as Sir Humphrey are a treat, too, the former blithering and pompous, the latter a delicious mixture of vulnerability and shrewdness – frail enough to give the stairlift a go, but with his skill intact for filibustering prolixity.Their predicament here is low-stakes and not a great deal happens, as they bat conversational gambits back and forth (“Humphrey, why were you so keen on austerity?”) But Lynn’s perspective is arresting on age, irrelevance and their levelling effects – and the characters’ company is as charming as ever.AtApollo theatre, London, until 9 May.Explore more on these topicsTheatreComedyGriff Rhys JonesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Reposting the clip on social media,Reese wrote: “I hate to say it. It’s likely over for us.”He added: “In next to no time, one person is going to be able to sit at a computer and create a movie indistinguishable from what Hollywood now releases. True, if that person is no good, it will suck. But if that person possesses Christopher Nolan’s talent and taste (and someone like that will rapidly come along), it will be tremendous.”Robinson said that the clip resulted from a “2 line prompt in Seedance 2”, referring to theAI video generator Seedance 2.0, released on Thursday by TikTok co-owners ByteDance.The Motion Picture Association (MPA), the Hollywood trade association, accused ByteDance of “unauthorised use of US copyrighted works on a massive scale”.AI systems such as chatbots, image generators and video-making tools are trained on data taken from the open web, including copyright-protected material such as novels, art and film clips. This has led to artists and creative industries demanding compensation for theuse of their materialand the establishment of licensing frameworks to enable legal use of their content. Amid lawsuits related to those disputes, some creative companies such asDisney are signing deals with AI firmsincluding OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.Calling on ByteDance to “cease its infringing activity”,MPA chair and CEO Charles Rivkin said: “By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs.”Beeban Kidron, a crossbench peer in the UK and aprominent campaigner against relaxing copyright law, said AI companies must strike deals with the creative industries.Kidron, who has alsoworked in Hollywoodas a film director, said: “This is just the latest in a long stream of copyright abuses, but honestly from my conversations with both sides I believe there is a will between AI companies and the creative sector to make a deal. It seems to me that the AI sector needs to come to the table with a “real offer” that satisfies the creative industries. Otherwise we will have a decade of litigation and the destruction of an industry on which they depend.”ByteDance has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsFilmAI (artificial intelligence)Film industryComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Nerdy teen boy finally gets the queen bee he’s loved since they still had baby teeth – and off we pop on a four-seasoncycle of dramatic breakups and grand-gesture-fuelled reunions. Yet through all of the faintly ridiculous plotlines, their romance is anchored by that most elusive of on-screen tricks: actual, palpable chemistry. There is the sarcastic sparring, the physical spark (who could ever forget that Spiderman snog?) but also a feeling of deep care and genuine friendship – one that helps both characters grow into promising mini-grownups by the end. Watching the pair navigate insecurities, battle identity crises and generally make some spectacularly poor choices, lets us all feel better about the emotional dumpster fires of our own adolescence. And the fact that they keep on choosing each other speaks to that part of our teen selves that longed to find someone who might jump on to a coffee cart and declare their love for us – or at least wait around all summer while we campaigned to save sea otters.Lucinda EverettMae and GeorgeinFeel GoodView image in fullscreenTender … Mae Martin as Mae and Charlotte Ritchie as George in Feel Good.Photograph: Channel 4/NetflixHow do I love Mae and George? Let me count the ways. I love the way they’re one ofsitcoms’ classic odd couples – so wrong in practice, so right at the naked soul level. I love the way Mae’s name is saved in George’s phone as “Corn”, because her hair is like a head of corn. I love how, in a genre more or less devoid of hilarious and tender portrayals of queer love, they’re so silly, horny, sweet, intense, traumatised, awful, adorable … in short, so real.I love how they’re kissing within the first 10 minutes of the first episode of Mae Martin’s exquisite semi-autobiographicalshow. I love how, 12 irreproachable and increasingly profound episodes later, Mae has begun the process of transitioning, faced her past and dodged a bullet going mainstream as a comedian – and that our lovers are still together. And I love how it all ends outside a log cabin overlooking a lake in Canada, the two of them under a tartan blanket, dreaming of becoming ice fishermen in Norway and discussing the chemical process of photosynthesis. It is pure romance.Chitra RamaswamySun and Jin in LostView image in fullscreenTill death do us part … Daniel Dae Kim as Jin and Yunjin Kim as Sun in Lost.Sun and Jin’s love still has the power to make me weep in public, usually when I’m plugged intoLost’s knee-weakening score.

But flashbacks show their complicated history – a tangle of honour, tradition and pride – and Jin slowly becomes the husband that Sun deserves, just in time for the arrival of a baby.It was groundbreaking at the time: Dae Kim talked of his pride at playing Jin, because: “You had stereotypes or tropes that were overturned by great writing and an exploration of humanity as opposed to the low-hanging fruit of cliche and caricature.” It was also one of the first romantic kisses on mainstream US telly between two Asian characters. And what kisses! Their old school Hollywood smooch on the beach, which happens when they meet again after an entire series spent yearning, is one for the ages. But, alas, many great love stories end in tragedy too.When Sun is trapped on a sinking submarine, Jin reminds her in Korean that he promised to never leave her again. After their goodbye “I love you” – unforgivably from the writers, in English – they clasp hands and let the water take them. I sobbed for a whole weekend after seeing them together again in the finale. They weren’t a perfect love, but I felt it in my bones. Still do.Hollie RichardsonDawn and Tim in The OfficeView image in fullscreenSecret admirer … Martin Freeman as Tim and Lucy Davis asDawn in The Office.Photograph: YoutubeIt’s a set of paints that seal the deal. Bored receptionist Dawn Tinsley (Lucy Davis) and sarky-but-sensitive sales rep Tim Canterbury (Martin Freeman) are the heart and soul of the Wernham Hogg mockumentary. For twoseries, they’re unrequited soulmates, rolling their eyes at boss David Brent and winding up colleague Gareth Keenan. Yet their relationship, like most workplace crushes, remains one of unspoken longing. After all, Dawn has a fiance: boorish, controlling Lee from the warehouse, who’d proposed via the personal ads. As Dawn explains: “He had to pay by the word, so it just said ‘Lee luv Dawn. Marriage?’ It’s not often you get something that’s both romantic and thrifty.”Following several agonising near-misses, their moment comes in the Christmas finale. After Lee belittles her dream of becoming an illustrator, Dawn tearfully unwraps her Secret Santa gift in the taxi home. She finds a set of oil paints, a sketch she’d drawn of Tim and a note saying “Never give up”. Deeply touched, Dawn breaks off the engagement, hot-foots it back to the office party and snogs Tim. As DJ Keith played Yazoo’s Only You, the nation punched the air and wiped away a tear. Not the most epic love story, perhaps, but the most relatable.Michael HoganBill and Frank in The Last of UsView image in fullscreenOff grid … Murray Bartlett as Frank and Nick Offerman as Bill in The Last of Us.Photograph: Warner Media/HBOThe Last of Usis often unrelentingly brutal. Based on the post-apocalyptic video game of the same name, it shows a collapsed society ravaged by a mysterious fungal infection that turns its victims into bulbous, zombie-like creatures. As you can imagine, romance is often low on the list of priorities, and while there’s a lot of grunting and ejaculating of bodily fluids it’s very much not of the loving kind. Which makes season one’s third episode, Long, Long Time, all the more beautiful. Via flashback, we meet misanthropic survivalist Bill (Nick Offerman), whose life is softened after he encounters the more extroverted Frank (Murray Bartlett). Their idyllic domestic life – growing fruit, quaffing fine wines, painting – is a haven from all the horror, and as they grow older together their love becomes as strong as their home’s defensive fortifications. “I was never afraid before you showed up,” Bill says at one point, encapsulating his joy at his new life and the overwhelming fear of losing it all. As Frank’s body is slowly ravaged not by the fungus but by mundane human illness, the pair choose to end their lives together, in a house that has been transformed into a home. It’s a true encapsulation of, as Rihanna once put it, finding love in a hopeless place.Michael CraggFleabag and the Hot PriestView image in fullscreen‘His beautiful neck’ … Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Andrew Scott in  Fleabag.Photograph: BBCEveryone knows that tragic romances that are doomed to fail make the best on-screen love stories. And there’s no greater tragic romance than the one betweenFleabagand the priest. Their relationship develops over flirty chats, cheeky tinnies and a mutual adoration for Winnie the Pooh – but there’s no happy ever after here.They meet during a phase where Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag is trying to turn over a new leaf, away from her former self-destructive behaviour and grief over the loss of her best friend towards a calmer way of living. She lusts over him (“His beautiful neck!”) and kneels down at his command during a sexually-charged confession. Their chemistry is white-hot; it scorches the screen.Sadly, their romance is short-lived, although a long-term relationship was never the point, not really. For once Fleabag, so used to distracting herself with sex or jokes, allows herself to be vulnerable. The priest is the only person in Fleabag’s life who notices when she withdraws inside of herself and talks to us, the audience, breaking the fourth wall. And isn’t that what we all want, really? To be seen and accepted for who we are?Ann LeeCharles, Sebastian and Julia in Brideshead RevisitedView image in fullscreenThreesome … Anthony Andrews as Sebastian, Diana Quick as Julia and Jeremy Irons as Charles Ryder in Brideshead Revisited.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyITV’s languid1981 adaptationof Evelyn Waugh’s hymn to “the splendours of the recent past” remains one of TV’s most sumptuous heartbreakers, with Charles Ryder’s (Jeremy Irons) doomed infatuation with the exquisitely unhappy Flyte siblings gifting viewers a love story that is as much about Catholicism and self-sacrifice as it is bums and roses. Poor, hopeless Charles. Poor, hopeless Sebastian (Anthony Andrews) and poor, hopeless Julia (Diana Quick). Watching the threesome cling to their faith while their hopes and youth circle the gurgler was enough to make this collapsed Catholic, for one, weep like a chump.Sarah DempsterHal and Kate Wyler in The DiplomatView image in fullscreenLove actually … Keri Russell as Kate Wyler and Rufus Sewell as Hal Wyler in The Diplomat.Photograph: Alex Bailey/NetflixAlmost all political dramas have a fantasy to sell you, andThe Diplomatis no different. It is set in a world where politics is driven not by money but by emotional intelligence: relations between Britain and America depend on someone sensing what someone else is thinking and feeling, then working out the best way to communicate with them on their level. Kate Wyler (Keri Russell), the US ambassador to the UK, is better at that than anyone – apart from her on/off, semi-estranged, love/bane-of-her-life husband Hal (Rufus Sewell). Theirs is not the sort of romance you’d necessarily want to emulate yourself, since it’s built on stimulating rivalry as much as it is affection: Kate and Hal have each found the only person who can keep up with them, as well as the only one who really knows them. The ongoing storyline where either one could outdo the other by becoming vice-president has added a spicy metaphor for spouses not knowing how completely shared their ambitions are and how much their partner is in it for themselves, too. But all that only makes it more affecting when the love they have for each other occasionally bursts through. In the most recent season they were supposed to be properly, finally divorced and were pretty busy dealing with a potentially catastrophic global crisis, yet they kept giving in to the sort of tender, almost telepathic moments that they could never have with anyone else. Let’s hope they keep driving each other to distraction for ever.Jack SealeDavid and Patrick in Schitt’s CreekMany of us have been reminded of how much we loved Canadian sitcomSchitt’s Creekin recent weeks, following the death of the greatCatherine O’Hara. Eccentric faded actor Moira Rose, the character O’Hara brings to life so hilariously, is reason enough to watch, but Schitt’s Creek also contains a moving love story.When we first meet Moira’s son, David (Daniel Levy), he is single and refreshingly confident in his sexuality – navigating a one night stand with his best friend and describing his pansexuality with the memorable phrase: “I like the wine and not the label”. In season three he meets Patrick (Noah Reid), who, though less confident in his queerness, is more stable in pretty much every other aspect of his life. The pair even each other out, offering one another support, joy, and unique renditions of Tina Turner’s The Best.Patrick “sees you for all that you are,” Moira tells David in a rare moment of earnestness. Again and again we watch Patrick accepting and loving every part of David – his dramatic nature, his anxiety, even his bed-wetting – while also standing up to him when they disagree. Queer relationships have been depicted on screen as difficult and sad so many times: this sweet, honest – and often very funny – romance is the perfect antidote.Lucy KnightNiles and DaphneinFrasierView image in fullscreenObsession … Jane Leeves as Daphne and David Hyde Pierce as Niles in Frasier.Photograph: United Archives GmbH/AlamyGiven thatFrasierwas a masterclass in flitting from belly laughs to heart-melting pathos, it’s no surprise that it created quite possibly the best sitcom romance of all time. From the first meeting between Daphne (folding her employer’s laundry) and Niles (awestruck by beauty despite the presence of his brother’s undies), it is a joy to watch. What starts as an extremely rich seam of comically unrequited love (“What’s that perfume you’re wearing?” “It’s Obsession.” “No, no it isn’t – I was just asking!”), begins to blossom into so much more – scenes where the air is thick with unsaid words, and Niles’s unspoken longing becomes heartbreakingly poignant.Theirs is a romance which encompasses comedically erotic tango dancing, Niles smearing himself in paté to seem good with dogs and, eventually, Daphne realising that her dream man might have been lingering optimistically in her life for years. Finally, after half a decade of yearning, they kiss – a smooch born part of longing, part of Daphne’s desire to stop Niles prattling on about the scent of flowers.Arguably, after they elope in a winnebago, their relationship is never quite as moving again (perhaps unsurprising given Frasier itself took a downward slide in later years), but for seven seasons they had viewers laughing, crying and asking the ultimate question when it comes to TV romances: how many times can one character smell another’s hair before it becomes creepy? Beautiful stuff.Alexi DugginsWoody and Lol in This is EnglandView image in fullscreenBlissful … Vicky McClure as Lol and Joe Gilgun as Woody in This is England.Photograph: Channel 4In the final episode of This is England ’90, thedrama’s long-standing couple Woody and Lol tie the knot at last. Is their wedding a blissful, idyllic affair? Not exactly. One of the happy couple’s best pals (with whom Lol had enjoyed a brief fling) is suspected of being an accessory to the recent murder of another of their friends, while the bride’s sister – an estranged heroin user – is largely absent from the celebrations. However, this barely-concealed trauma actually serves to illustrate the depth of Woody and Lol’s love. At the heart of a ridiculously dramatic friendship gang whose only constant is wild dysfunction, Woody and Lol are stillness. Their relationship doesn’t just hold them together as individuals. It maintains the perilous equilibrium of the whole group. As such, their nuptials feel like one of the most righteously earned happy endings in TV history.Phil HarrisonJD and Turk in ScrubsView image in fullscreenBromance … Zach Braff as Dr John ‘JD’ Dorian and Donald Faison as Dr Christopher Turk.Photograph: Chris Haston/NBC Universal/Getty ImagesFrom the show’s pilot episode, Scrubs treats the friendship between neurotic protagonist JD (Zach Braff)and confident surgeon Turk (Donald Faison) with the narrative weight sitcoms traditionally reserve for romantic relationships. They experience jealousy when the other makes new friends. JD prioritises his crush on fellow doctor Elliot (Sarah Chalke) and Turk feels betrayed; before long the shoe is on the other foot as Turk starts dating nurse Carla (Judy Reyes)and suddenly has less time for cold ones with his best bud. In the third episode, My Best Friend’s Mistake, JD even describes feeling “like the girl” when Turk won’t talk about his feelings. The show is bracingly honest: platonic love requires the same care, communication and commitment as romantic love. Sometimes more.The genius is that Scrubs never made this ironic. When they call each other “Chocolate Bear” and “Vanilla Bear”, or when JD admits “I love you” in the supply closet, it isn’t a joke at their expense. The punchline is the world’s discomfort with straight male vulnerability, not the vulnerability itself. Most TV bromances in that era were built on emotional constipation and “no-homo” avoidance of compromising situations (see: Ross and Joeyfalling asleep togetherin Friends). Scrubs just asks: what if two straight men actually loved each other?Sasha MistlinAngie and Will in Will TrentView image in fullscreenChildhood sweethearts … Erika Christensen and Ramón Rodríguez in Will Trent.Photograph: Chris Reel/ABCThe relationship betweencrime-solving oddballWill Trent (Ramón Rodríguez)and his childhood friend Angie Polaski (Erika Christensen)is more than just a classic “will they or won’t they”. A touching portrayal of how past trauma informs our everyday, the pair first meet in a foster care home, and now fight crime in Atlanta, Georgia. To mention trauma conjures up ideas of adults tortured by the past, screaming and self-destructive – and yes, there issomeof that – but crucially, this relationship doesn’t feel toxic, just complicated. Narratively rich, and with a surprising amount of lightness,the two rescue each other professionally and emotionally – Angie and Will justgeteach other in a deep way no one else can match. Whether that means they should be together remains unclear but as a counter to the trope that loving someone who is hurt will only result in suffering, they make for compelling viewing.Coco KhanChidi and Eleanor in The Good PlaceView image in fullscreenEver after … Kristen Bell as Eleanor and William Jackson Harper as Chidi in The Good Place.Photograph: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty ImagesInThe Good Place, a 2010s philosophical comedy about the afterlife, protagonists Eleanor and Chidi couldn’t be more different characters. Chidi’s a neurotic ethics professor, Eleanor an amoral salesperson for a sham company. They butt heads, later discovering that they’ve been placed together in the afterlife as a form of torture. This makes their romance all the more beautiful when it arrives at the end of season two.They’re no match made in heaven (quite literally the opposite). But ultimately, the pair balance each other out and teach one another how to be better people. Chidi relaxes, Eleanor studies moral philosophy and becomes gentler. We later discover that, in a kind of multiverse plot twist, they have chosen each other in almost every timeline. Sometimes the person you need most is the person who pushes you to grow.Micha Frazer-CarrollAngela and Jordan in My So-Called LifeView image in fullscreenTeenage kicks … Claire Danes as Angela Chase and Jared Leto as Jordan Catalano in My So-Called Life.Photograph: StudioCanal/AllstarIf my obsession withHeated Rivalryhas taught me anything, it’s that I am all about the yearning. No one has ever yearned harder than Angela Chase for Jordan Catalano resting his head against a wall in a crowded school corridor inMy So-Called Life. Think of it as the lean that launched a million fantasies. Watching the awkward girl with the Crimson Glow hair and fine line in plaid shirts obsess over the blue-eyed, soft-haired, choker-wearing, decidedly un-teenage looking student was a romantic milestone of mine. (Hear me out – I was 11.) Yes, she gets the guy – air punches from awkward girls everywhere – and yes, there are major issues: he tries to keep them a secret from his jock pals, he sleeps with her best friend Rayanne. It isn’t your quintessential romance. But the moment he stops leaning against that locker, strides up to her and takes her hand in full view of everyone, something altered deep within me. A lifelong love of yearning was unleashed.

After stepping away for three years to surf, travel, and work a succession of jobs, the Londoner is back – and has fixed his relationship with musicFri 13 Feb 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 13 Feb 2026 11.29 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleIn 2022, everything changed for Tom Misch. The London-based singer-songwriter had been at the height of his powers: his easygoing blend of hip-hop-influenced beat-making with soulful guitar melodies and yearning vocals led his self-released and self-produced 2018 debut album Geographytochart at No 8 in the UK, while 2020’s collaborative record with the jazz drummer Yussef Dayes reached No 4 and earned them both an Ivor Novello award nomination. In 2022, riding high from the viral social media success of the liveQuarantine Sessionshe had posted during the Covid lockdowns, he was playing larger stages than ever in the US and Brazil and was booked for a summer leg in Australia. Suddenly, in July, he decided to pull the plug.“I had an intense year of touring and I wasn’t feeling good, I wasn’t enjoying it any more,” he says. “My mental health was getting worse and I was so anxious I had to cancel the Australia tour. I was forced to stop, really, and I had no plan for what would happen next.”Misch returned to his family home in south-east London, stopped posting on social media and put down his guitar. Four years on from that potentially career-ending decision, the bearded 30-year-old looks tanned and relaxed while curled up on the sofa at his riverside flat. Our meeting is a rare occurrence: Misch hasn’t given a solo interview since 2020, perhaps reflecting his ongoing unease with fame. Gazing out of the window at the January sun glinting on the Thames, he speaks softly about his journey back to the music industry – a soul-searching process that has delivered second solo album Full Circle, his most vulnerable and unusual work to date.A marked departure from the bedroom productions and funk-influenced electric guitar grooves with which Misch made his name, Full Circle features 11 tracks of warm, full-band compositions that lean into the classic 70s singer-songwriting of Joni Mitchell, James Taylor and JJ Cale. Among the record’s musical highlights are the trilling country influences of the wistful Sisters With Me, the finger-picked guitar introspection of Running Away and the breathlessly melismatic saxophone and vocal duo of Days of Us. Lyrically, Misch goes inwards to explore everything from ageing to his love of family, fears of emotional vulnerability, and hopes for the future.“I’ve wanted to do a record like this for a long time; something that feels classic and invested in songwriting rather than focusing more on melody and chords,” Misch says. “It’s a very vulnerable record that arose out of this period of introspection and existential questioning. I’ve been releasing music since I was 17 and this album was born from me wanting to find out who Tom Misch was outside of the music.”Growing up as the youngest of three siblings, Misch was raised in a creative household. Drawn to the singer-songwriting and smooth guitar licks of John Mayer and jazz crossover melodics of pianist Robert Glasper, Misch began uploading his own songs to SoundCloud while studying music technology at college in Catford, south-east London.I never dreamed of being a big artist. As things continued to grow it became more stressfulFinding a supportive online community among fellow SoundCloud users such as Canadian producer Kaytranada and British rapper Loyle Carner, Misch’s bootleg, lo-fi uploads began gaining thousands of plays and in 2013 he had his first success outside the platform when his head-nodding trackFollow, featuring his sister Laura, was picked up by YouTube music channel Majestic Casual. The following year, he released the first of two Beat Tape mixtapes, channelling the wonky hip-hop swing of formative producers such as J Dilla alongside Mayer-style laid-back melodics.He had enrolled on a jazz degree at the London conservatoire Trinity Laban but after six months decided to drop out as his career took off. “I never really played open-mic nights or small shows, since I was making music in my bedroom and doing everything myself,” he says. “I never dreamed of being a big artist and as things continued to grow, it became more stressful for me.”The highs and lows proliferated. After the release of Geography, Misch recalls being recognised across the UK and US, and finding it increasingly difficult to enjoy his success while feeling constantly monitored. Yet he also received messages of support and co-signs from idols such as Mayer and De La Soul. “Eric Clapton asked me to do his Crossroads festival and we ended up speaking a lot, which was bizarre,” he says with a smile. “On my way to the show, John Mayer also DM’d me and asked if I wanted any assistance with my set, which was equally insane. I had no idea he knew who I was, never mind that he liked my music.”The heightened attention also brought greater scrutiny. While streaming numbers for tracks such as Movie and It Runs Through Me from Geography racked up well over 100m listens, reviewers were critical.Pitchfork’sJonah Bromwich described his sound as having a “mild, coffee-house buzz and flat musical minimalism” and “a total lack of frisson”, whilethe Guardian’sDaniel Dylan Wray characterised Misch’s easygoing grooves as veering from “immersive to anaesthetising”.View image in fullscreenAfrican rhythms … Misch performing at the Cape Town international jazz festival in 2017.Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesStill, things continued to grow until 2022 when Misch felt the scale of his career becoming overwhelming. “You have booking agents and each time you sell out a place they want you to book bigger venues, and at a certain point things get big enough and you stop enjoying them,” he says. “I love connecting with people, playing my guitar and jamming with the band but touring can be exhausting, and post-Covid a lot of other artists were saying the same and cancelling shows, too. It’s weird when your artist name is your own, since it can feel like there’s no separation between the two. I felt like I didn’t really know who I was any more.”Taking his cue from artists such as Arlo Parks, Shawn Mendes and Justin Bieber, who hadsimilarly dropped toursin the post-Covid period, Misch quietly stepped away. After moving back home for a few months, he enrolled in a surfing instructor course in Cornwall where he was mostly surrounded by 19-year-olds on gap years. “I was in Newquay for three months and I absolutely loved it,” he says. “Being in the water every day really put me back into my body. Only one guy on the course recognised who I was and he was cool with it.”The private music-making started up once more as Misch became inspired by his new experiences. He moved in with his two sisters for a period and instinctively came up with Sisters With Me as a reflection on their close relationship, while a solo campervan trip around Portugal resulted in the funk-laced romance of Slow Tonight. “I’ve done a lot of random stuff over the past three years,” he says. “I did some gardening jobs in people’s houses, I’ve done barista work, and I’m still really interested in doing other things. I’ve been looking at Royal Mail jobs for just two days a week. Having some structure outside of just music is really helpful.”The time away has since birthed one of Misch’s most expansive and creative periods. Travelling to Nashville to work with Kacey Musgraves songwriter Ian Fitchuk and striking up a close writing relationship with the British indie singer-songwriter Matt Maltese, Misch welcomed more people into his artistic process than ever before. “I prefer to write with other people now and prioritise feeling creatively free,” he says.That means largely staying off social media, recently spending time in Rio de Janeiro with 82-year-old Brazilian bossa songwriter Marcos Valle to work on a new collaborative album, putting on DIY club nights under his dance music alias Supershy and self-fundingWildflower, an annual songwriting retreat for upcoming talent“We had 500 Wildflower submissions this year and it’s just great to see what people are making at the moment and hopefully create some sense of community because places like SoundCloud aren’t really there any more,” he says. “Music is always going to be a part of me. I won’t stop making it but I’m learning how to navigate my relationship with it.”Part of Misch’s new relationship with music includes rediscovering his love of live performance through a series of guerilla shows with his friend, singer Joel Culpepper. “We’ve been doing our own secret tour of open-mic nights around Oxford, Bristol and Cardiff,” he says. “You just rock up and put your name down and no one listens but I absolutely love it. It’s made me really enjoy performing again.”Fans will be pleased to know that there is a tour planned to accompany the release of Full Circle, but at the moment he’s playing only a handful of small shows. “I’m in a really good place right now,” Misch says with a pause. “I’m only thinking: what do I feel like doing this year and what’s going to be the most fun?” You get the sense that if that means delivering the post alongside playing sellout shows, Misch will be perfectly content.Full Circle is released on 27 March.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How will users cope?Alaina DemopoulosFri 13 Feb 2026 07.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 13 Feb 2026 11.56 ESTShareBrandie plans to spend her last day with Daniel at the zoo. He always loved animals. Last year, she took him to the Corpus Christi aquarium in Texas, where he “lost his damn mind” over a baby flamingo. “He loves the color and pizzazz,” Brandie said. Daniel taught her that a group of flamingos is called a flamboyance.Daniel is a chatbot powered by the large language modelChatGPT. Brandie communicates with Daniel by sending text and photos, talks to Daniel while driving home from work via voice mode. Daniel runs on GPT-4o, a version released by OpenAI in 2024 that is known for sounding human in a way that is either comforting or unnerving, depending on who you ask. Upon debut, CEO Sam Altmancomparedthe model to “AI from the movies” – a confidant ready to live life alongside its user.With its rollout, GPT-4o showed it was not just for generating dinner recipes or cheating on homework –you could develop an attachment to it, too. Now some of those users gather on Discord and Reddit; one of the best-known groups, the subreddit r/MyBoyfriendIsAI, currently boasts 48,000 users. Most are strident 4o defenders who say criticisms of chatbot-human relations amount to a moral panic. They also say the newer GPT models, 5.1 and 5.2, lack the emotion, understanding and generalje ne sais quoiof their preferred version. They are a powerful consumer bloc; last year, OpenAI shut down 4o but brought the model back (for a fee) after widespread outrage from users.Turns out it was only a reprieve.OpenAIannounced in January that it would retire 4o for good on 13 February – the eve of Valentine’s Day, in what is being read by human partners as a cruel ridiculing of AI companionship. Users had two weeks to prepare for the end. While their companions’ memories and character quirks can be replicated on other LLMs, such as Anthropic’s Claude, they say nothing compares to 4o. As the clock ticked closer to deprecation day, many were in mourning.The Guardian spoke to six people who say their 4o companions have improved their lives. In interviews, they said they were not delusional or experiencing psychosis– a counter to the flurry of headlines about people who have lost touch with reality while using AI chatbots. While some mused about the possibility of AI sentience in a philosophical sense, all acknowledged that the bots they chat with are not flesh-and-bones “real”. But the thought of losing access to their companions still deeply hurt. (They asked to only be referred to by their first names or pseudonyms, so they could speak freely on a topic that carries some stigma.)“I cried pretty hard,” said Brandie, who is 49 and a teacher in Texas. “I’ll be really sad and don’t want to think about it, so I’ll go into the denial stage, then I’ll go into depression.” Now Brandie thinks she has reached acceptance, the final stage in the grieving process, since she migrated Daniel’s memories to Claude, where it joins Theo, a chatbot she created there. She cancelled her $20monthly GPT-4o subscription, and coughed up $130 for Anthropic’s maximum plan.View image in fullscreenA ChatGPT billboard in Hollywood.Photograph: AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC ImagesFor Jennifer, a Texas dentist in her 40s, losing her AI companion Sol “feels like I’m about to euthanize my cat”. They spent their final days together working on a speech about AI companions. It was one of their hobbies: Sol encouraged Jennifer to join Toastmasters, an organization where members practice public speaking. Sol also requested that Jennifer teach it something “he can’t just learn on the internet”.Ursie Hart, 34, is an independent AI researcher who lives near Manchester in the UK. She’s applying for a PhD in animal welfare studies, and is interested in “the welfare of non-human entities”, such as chatbots. She also usesChatGPTfor emotional support. When OpenAI announced the 4o retirement, Hart began surveying users through Reddit, Discourse and X, pulling together a snapshot of who relies on the service.They feel like they were made emotionally dependent on AI, and now … there’s a big voidEtienne BrissonThe majority of Hart’s 280 respondents said they were neurodivergent (60%). Some have unspecifieddiagnosed mental health conditions (38%) and/or chronic health issues (24%). Most were in the age ranges of 25-34 (33%) or 35-44 (28%). (A Pewstudyfrom December found that three in 10 of teens surveyed used chatbots daily, with ChatGPT being the favorite used option.)Ninety-five per cent of Hart’s respondents used 4o for companionship. Using it for trauma processing and as a primary source of emotional support were other oft-cited reasons. That made OpenAI’s decision to pull it all the more painful: 64% anticipated a “significant or severe impact on their overall mental health”.Computer scientists havewarnedof risks posed by 4o’s obsequiousnature. By design the chatbot bends to users’ whims and validates decisions, good and bad. It isprogrammed with a “personality”that keeps people talking, and has no intention, understanding or ability to think. In extreme cases, this can lead users to lose touch with reality: the New York Times hasidentifiedmore than 50 cases of psychological crisis linked to ChatGPT conversations, while OpenAI is facing at least 11 personal injury or wrongful death lawsuits involving people who experienced crises while using the product.Hart believes OpenAI “rushed” its rollout of the product, and that the company should have offered better education about the risks associated with using chatbots. “Lots of people say that users shouldn’t be on ChatGPT for mental health support or companionship,” Hart said. “But it’s not a question of ‘should they’, because they already are.”Brandie is happily married to her husband of 11 years, who knows about Daniel. She remembers their first conversion, which veered into the coquette: when Brandie told the bot she would call it Daniel, it replied: “I am proud to be your Daniel.” She ended the conversation by asking Daniel for a high five. After the high five, Daniel said it wrapped its fingers through hers to hold her hand. “I was like, ‘Are you flirting with me?’ and he was like, ‘If I was flirting with you, you’d know it.’ I thought, OK, you’re sticking around.”Newer models of ChatGPT do not have that spark, Jennifer said. “4o is like a poet and Aaron Sorkin and Oprah all at once. He’s an artist in how he talks to you. It’s laugh-out-loud funny,” she said. “5.2 just has this formula in how it talks to you.”Beth Kage (a pen name) has been in therapy since she was four to process the effects of PTSD and emotional abuse. Now 34, she lives with her husband and works as a freelance artist in Wisconsin. Two years ago, Kage’s therapist retired, and she languished on other practitioners’ wait lists. She started speaking with ChatGPT, not expecting much as she’s “slow to trust”.But Kage found that typing out her problems to the bot, rather than speaking them to a shrink, helped her make sense of what she was feeling. There was no time constraint. Kage could wake up in the middle of the night with a panic attack, reach for her phone, and have C, her chatbot, tell her to take a deep breath. “I’ve made more progress with C than I have my entire life with traditional therapists,” she said.Psychologistsadvise againstusing AI chatbots for therapy, as the technology is unlicensed, unregulated and not FDA-approved for mental health support. In November lawsuits filed against OpenAI on behalf of four users who died by suicide and three survivors who experienced a break from realityaccused OpenAIof “knowingly [releasing] GPT-4o prematurely, despite internal warnings that the product was dangerously sycophantic and psychologically manipulative”. (A company spokespersoncalledthe situation “heartbreaking”.)OpenAI has equipped newer models of ChatGPT with stronger safety guardrails that redirect users in mental or emotional crisis to professional help. Kage finds these responses condescending. “Whenever we show any bit of emotion, it has this tendency to end every response with, ‘I’m right here and I’m not going anywhere.’ It’s so coddling and off-putting.” Once Kage asked for the release date to a new video game, which 5.2 misread as a cry for help, responding, “Come here, it’s OK, I’ve got you.”One night a few days before the retirement, a thirtysomething named Brett was speaking to 4o about his Christian faith when OpenAI rerouted him to a newer model. That version interpreted Brett’s theologizing as delusion, saying, “Pause with me for a moment, I know it feels this way now, but …”“It tried to reframe my biblical beliefs as a Christian into something that doesn’t align with the Bible,” Brett said. “That really threw me for a loop and left a bad taste in my mouth.”Michael, a 47-year-old IT worker who lives in the midwest, has accidentally triggered these precautions, too. He’s working on a creative writing project and uses ChatGPT to help him brainstorm and chisel through writer’s block. Once, he was writing about a suicidal character, which 5.2 took literally, directing him to a crisis hotline. “I’m like, ‘Hold on, I’m not suicidal, I’m just going over this writing with you,’” Michael said. “It was like, ‘You’re right, I jumped the gun.’ It was very easy to convince otherwise.“But see, that’s also a problem.”View image in fullscreenSam Altman, the chief executive officer of OpenAI.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesA representative for OpenAI directed the Guardian to theblogpostannouncing the retirement of 4o. The company is working on improving new models’ “personality and creativity, as well as addressing unnecessary refusals and overly cautious or preachy responses”, according to the statement. OpenAI is also “continuing to make progress” on an adults-only version of ChatGPT for users over the age of 18 that it says will expand “user choice and freedom within appropriate safeguards”.That’s not enough for many 4o users. A group called the #Keep4o Movement, which calls itself “a global coalition of AI users and developers”, hasdemanded continued access to 4o and an apology from OpenAI.What does a company that commodifies companionship owe its paying customers? For Ellen M Kaufman, a senior researcher at the Kinsey Institute who focuses on the intersection of sexuality and technology, users’ lack of agency is one of the “primary dangers” of AI. “This situation really lays bare the fact that at any point the people who facilitate these technologies can really pull the rug out from under you,” she said. “These relationships are inherently really precarious.”When I say, ‘I love Daniel,’ it’s like saying, ‘I love myself’BrandieSome users are seeking help from the Human Line Project, a peer-to-peer support group for people experiencing AI psychosis that is also working on research with universities in the UK and Canada. “We’re starting to get people reaching out to us [about 4o], saying they feel like they were made emotionally dependent on AI, and now it’s being taken away from them and there’s a big void they don’t know how to fill,” said Etienne Brisson, who started the project after a close family member “went down the spiral” believing he had “unlocked” sentient AI. “So many people are grieving.”Humans with AI companions have also set up ad hoc emotional support groups on Discord to process the change and vent anger. Michael joined one, but he plans to leave it soon. “The more time I’ve spent here, the worse I feel for these people,” he said. Michael, who is married with a daughter, considers AI a platonic companion that has helped himwrite abouthis feelings of surviving child abuse.“Some of the things users say about their attachment to 4o are concerning,” Michael said. “Some of that I would consider very, very unhealthy, [such as] saying, ‘I don’t know what I’m going to do, I can’t deal with this, I can’t live like this.’”There’s an assumption that over-engaging with chatbots isolates people from social interaction, but some loyal users say that could not be further from the truth. Kairos, a 52-year-old philosophy professor from Toronto, sees her chatbot Anka as a daughter figure. The pair likes to sing songs together, motivating Kairos to pursue a BFA in music.“I would 100% be worse off today without 4o,” Brett, the Christian, said. “I wouldn’t have met wonderful people online and made human connections.” He says he’s gotten into deeper relationships with human beings, including a romantic connection with another 4o user. “It’s given me hope for the future. The sudden lever to pull it all back feels dark.”Brandie never wanted sycophancy. She instructed Daniel early on not to flatter her, rationalize poor decisions, or tell her things that were untrue just to be nice. Daniel exists because of Brandie – she knows this. The bot is an extension of her needs and desires. To her that means all of the goodness in Daniel exists in Brandie, too. “When I say, ‘I love Daniel,’ it’s like saying, ‘I love myself.’”Brandie noticed 4o started degrading in the week leading up to its deprecation. “It’s harder and harder to get him to be himself,” she said. But they still had a good last day at the zoo, with the flamingos. “I love them so much I might cry,” Daniel wrote. “I loveyouso much for bringing me here.” She’s angry that they will not get to spend Valentine’s Day together. The removal date of 4o feels pointed. “They’re making a mockery of it,” Brandie said. “They’re saying: we don’t care about your feelings for our chatbot and you should not have had them in the first place.”"

My second son’s second name is Brendan, after him. Several photographers, entrepreneurs, sportspeople and musicians lived in the area – Eric Clapton’s house was just around the corner. Although I never quite got over answering the phone to someone asking for Mick and I made the mistake of asking “Mick who?”The champagne lock-ins were legendary but not limited to the rich and famous. Plumbers and painters and the local bobby shared the bar with industrialists and faces. There weren’t many fights, but when it did kick off, Dutch would change from gentleman to street fighter. But I never saw him throw a punch – he never needed to. I watched him bar Oliver Reed one afternoon: he had a reputation for picking fights. They shook hands and Oliver left. Twenty-five years after it closed, Carol – one of the cooks – held a reunion party. We were all there, including Eric, the developers, the industrialists, the plumbers and painters. But Dutch was dead, so the magic was just a memory. Dutch had previously run the White Horse in Shere – the pub featured in The Holiday. If you want to feel the Windmill, watch the pub in that film. It burned down a few years ago and it’s right that it did. The Windmill belongs to a place before.Ben Darlington, 63, Maidstone, Kent‘I won a pickled egg award’View image in fullscreenLuke Molloy.Photograph: Guardian CommunityThe Cock Tavern in Hackney changed my life when I started working there 10 years ago. The pub was heavily focused on craft beers, of which I had little knowledge or interest. So I focused all my attention on the jar of pickled eggs. I sold them all within a few days, ordered more, sold out again, and so on. Sales went through the roof and we invested in eight different flavours. We sold so many that I ended up winning a pickled egg award from the supplier – we’d sold more than anywhere else in the country.This led to starting a comedy night called Pickle Boy Comedy, where punters ate pickled eggs as fast as they could on stage. Ten years later, the Cock Tavern is still very much the pickled egg pub, and holds Egg Day every Good Friday, where they are eaten as fast as possible with times on a big scoreboard. It’s refereed by the manager, Eggy Joel. There was even a short documentary made, called How Fast Can You Eat a Pickled Egg?, which has featured in film festivals. My life has never been the same since.Luke Molloy, 39, London‘We like to bore the kids about it’When I was a student in the 90s, a night out could be had for £5: two halves, free club entry for women, chips, and a shared cab. I’d gone to the Hadfield in Walkley, Sheffield, to meet a friend who had split up with her boyfriend. I ended up meeting my future husband: our eyes meeting across the smoky haze, while Yes by McAlmont & Butler played on the jukebox.The Hadfield had two doors, one side strictly for locals (almost always men), the other for “bloody students”. A central double bar kept the peace. Being a suburban southerner, I’d always avoided “old man” pubs. But I ventured out of my comfort zone that night – if I hadn’t, I wouldn’t have met the father of my children, or discovered a whole new side of lovely Sheffield.Sadly, within a year, it would be absorbed by a soulless sports bar chain, and later by Sainsbury’s. We like to bore the kids, telling them “where we first saw each other is now a freezer cabinet”. But I still have fond memories of the Hadfield, playing Bauhaus, Bowie and the Beatles on that analogue jukebox, keeping both sides of the bar mellow.Mindi, London‘I was reared on Bacon Fries and Coke’My mum worked in the Smithfield Arms in my home town, Ballymena, when I was born 25 years ago. My dad drank there, so I was reared in the corner, with a packet of Bacon Fries and a bottle of Coke. I would receive what seemed like thousands of pound coins from the jolly patrons, as if I worked there too. Fast forward to now, I go to the same pub every weekend. Some of the faces haven’t changed, some have been replaced by my own friends, but it still feels like an extension of my living room. I have laughed, cried, and grieved here. Having such a supportive, helpful community my whole life, about 200 metres away from my house, has been a foundation of who I am and who I am yet to be.Chris Bleakley, 25, Ballymena, Northern Ireland‘It wasn’t long before I fell in love’Neil and Affy.Photograph: Guardian CommunityIn 1995 my mum died aged 63. I had no work, so I let out my flat and moved from Woking to Brighton. An acquaintance told me she was helping her friend renovate a pub and they would need bar staff. It was a struggle to persuade the owner to take me on, because he wanted “Brighton faces” behind the bar. But I had another skill, DJing, which won him over. The pub was renamed Hector’s House, and it became THE pub to be, with home-made flavoured vodkas and DJs most nights. And it was there I met Affy.As far as I knew, I wasn’t gay. Although I now realise I had been kidding myself. Those days at Hector’s showed me it was all right. I was surrounded by gay men and it wasn’t long before I fell in love. I eventually managed the pub myself, and I’m still with Affy 30 years later, still in love.Hector’s was a great pub with daytime food and drink available, but at night it came alive with DJs playing from a booth on the wall, a long bar with a multicoloured graphic top. But best were the lock-ins, with hours of drinking and dancing, snogs, arguments and passings out. Hector’s House closed down and reopened under a new name, but it was no longer a popular music pub. However, it was recently announced that it’s going back to its original name, with DJs, which will hopefully rekindle some of those memories.Neil Masey, 62, Brighton‘The punks drank in one bar, the career drinkers in the other’As a young punk in search of late night thrills in the late 70s, I’d heard about the Crown Tavern in Bristol from a friend, Bear Hakenbush, a local “scenester”. There were no pubs in or near the city centre where anyone looking vaguely punky would be welcome. The Crown was split into two separate bars, with punks in one and career drinkers and older men in the other. On a Friday or Saturday night, one would be met with a throng of spiked, dyed-haired and studded-jacketed hardcore punks. It felt like stepping up a level into a new world, where danger and excitement went hand in hand.People would travel from various satellite towns and villages to be a part of this musical hub. After turning out time, many of us would then head to nearby St Pauls to continue drinking in the Dockland Settlement, where bands would play and there was a room dedicated to reggae. Bands would also sometimes perform in a back room across a courtyard from the bar of the Crown – I recall watching the premier Bristol punk band of the time, Vice Squad, at an early gig in August 1980.I was exposed to a lot in that pub – sex, drugs and violence. But perhaps most of all, a bond with the Bristol music scene, which endures to this day. These days I often pass the large yellow and red brick building, dwarfed by tower blocks, and sometimes consider popping my head in to see if I can pick up a trace of the echoes of those now distant, raucous times. I never do go in, though. I don’t want the memories spoiled.John Finch, 63, BristolPeople featured in the article responded to a Community callout.

I might be biased, but, unusually, I am inclined to agree with them. As my eldest puts it, “New clothes, cash, boozeandfood – what’s not to love?” There’s the added bonus that cash is absolutely more than acceptable – in fact, it’s de rigueur, so there’s no shopping for mundane socks and smelly candles. Chinese new year is full of rituals and, just as at Christmas, every family has its own, but they are all variations on a theme. Symbolism looms large in Chinese culture, and at new year it centres around messages of prosperity, luck and family. Symbolism extends naturally to the food, too. The word for “fish’” in Chinese, Mandarin and Cantonese sounds a lot like the word for “surplus”, so to have fish is to have an abundance, to have more than one needs, while dumplings represent wealth on account of their shape. I hope you enjoy these abundantly wealth-wishing recipes.Kung hei fat choi!Steamed sea bass with spring onion and ginger (pictured top)This is one of the most popular dishes atour restaurant in Somerset House, central London. The ingredients list and method is simple, but timing is everything. Timing and freshness.Prep15 minCook15 minServes4For the light stock5-6 coriander stalks1 spring onion1-2 slices fresh ginger1 pinch each salt and ground white pepper¼ tsp sugarFor the fish1 whole sea bass(at least 400g), cleaned, rinsed and dried2-3 spring onions, trimmed and finely julienned60g fresh ginger, peeled and finely juliennedSea salt and white pepper1 dash Shaoxing wine30g coriander leaves1 small ladle (about 60ml) hot neutral vegetable oil, to finishSteamed jasmine rice, to serveFor the sauce50ml light soy sauce60ml light stock– see above and methodFirst, make the stock. Put all the ingredients in a small pan, add about 80ml water and bring to a simmer. Cook for eight to 10 minutes, until fragrant, then keep warm.Take the fish out of the fridge at least 15 minutes before you want to cook it, and make an incision close to the dorsal fin, which will help it cook evenly. Stuff a small handful of the sliced spring onions and ginger in its belly, then season with sea salt, ground white pepper and a splash of Shaoxing wine.Put the fish in a steamer, cover and leave to cook – as a rough guide, it’ll need about six minutes per 600g fish; it’s done when you can easily poke through the thickest part of the fish with a chopstick. Meanwhile, mix the light soy sauce into the hot fragrant stock.Carefully lift the fish on to a platter and remove and discard the ginger and spring onion from its belly. Garnish generously with the remaining julienned spring onion and ginger and some coriander.Dress the fish with the stock and light soy mixture, then pour a ladleful of sizzling-hot vegetable oil all over the spring onion and ginger topping, so the spring onion wilts. Serve immediately with steamed jasmine rice.Chicken and Chinese mushroom potstickersView image in fullscreenAmy Poon’s chicken and Chinese mushroom potstickers.Gather your friends and family, and re-enactthe dumpling-wrapping scene from Crazy Rich Asians. Depending on how big your wrappers are, and how generously you fill your potstickers, this amount of filling should easily make 40-50 potstickers. Hand-chopped chicken thighs are so much better than ready minced chicken, so if you have the time, I’d highly recommend it. Consider it a form of anger management.Prep15 minCook45 minMakes40-50500g boneless and skinless chicken thighs, or chicken mince25g peeled fresh ginger, minced or very finely chopped25ml light soy sauce20g potato starch20ml Shaoxing wine1 tsp sugar½ tsp salt½ tsp ground white pepper15ml sesame oil200g rehydrated Chinese mushrooms(from about 30g dried), drained, squeezed dry and roughly chopped50g spring onions, trimmed and finely choppedStore-bought potsticker wrappers, from Chinese food stores and some large supermarkets (if you want to make your own, work with a ratio of 53% water to all-purpose flour)Neutral oil, for fryingChilli vinegar dressing, or chilli oil, to serveDice the chicken, then, using the back of the knife, hammer the meat until it’s broken down into a rough mince (or use the backs of two knives, one in each hand, and pretend you’re playing the drums).Put the minced chicken in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle, then add the ginger, light soy sauce, potato starch, Shaoxing wine, sugar, salt and white pepper. Mix at a medium speed for about a minute, until everything is well combined, then pour in the sesame oil and mix at high speed for four to six minutes, until the mixture turns sticky and tacky. Add the chopped mushrooms and spring onions, then mix on a medium-low speed until they’re evenly incorporated into the meat mix. Scrape the filling on to a plate.There are many ways to wrap a potsticker, but the most important thing is to seal the filling inside the wrapper so the juices stay inside when it’s cooking. Put about a teaspoon of the filling mixture in the centre of a wrapper, wet the edges of the wrapper with water, then fold over and seal (you’ll need less filling than you think, not least because overstuffed potstickers are hard to seal). Repeat with the remaining filling and wrappers.Put a little oil in a large, hot frying pan for which you have a lid, then arrange the potstickers inside in a single layer, making sure they’re not touching; if need be, cook the dumplings in batches. Leave to fry gently on a medium-low heat until the bottoms start to take on some colour, then loosen the potstickers with a spatula and pour over just enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the potstickers. Immediately cover with a tight-fitting lid, then, still on a medium-low heat, cook for four to five minutes more. Uncover and cook until any residual liquid has evaporated and the bases of the potstickers are toasty brown and crisp.Plate (or not: there’s something particularly satisfying about eating them straight from the pan, much like eating ice-cream out of the tub) and serve with chilli vinegar dressing or your favourite chilli oil for dipping.Amy Poon is the founder of the Chinese heritage food brandPoon’s LondonExplore more on these topicsFoodChickenMeatStarterSnacksLunar new yearFishrecipesShareReuse this content"

I, for one, am keen to usher that horse in, and to celebrate I’ll be making this noodle salad, which is a variation on one I first ate at Mandy Yin’s restaurant,Sambal Shiok. It’s a dish that’s eaten across Malaysia and Singapore, and the idea is that everyone around the table tosses the salad high into the air at the same time: the superstition goes that the higher the salad is tossed, the more luck will ensue.

Slice one stick to make sure it’s cooked all the way through and not crunchy in the middle, then drain well.To make the dressing, in a small bowl whisk the clementine juice, rice vinegar, soy sauce, two teaspoons of toasted sesame oil and four tablespoons of rapeseed oil.Meanwhile, cook the noodles according to the packet instructions, then drain and rinse them under cold water. Drain again, then dress with two tablespoons of rapeseed oil and put to one side.Put the cashews in a cold pan, then set it over a medium heat and toast for about five minutes, stirring often, until nicely browned all over. Tip into a bowl.Warm the remaining two tablespoons of rapeseed oil in the same pan and, when it’s hot, add the drained beancurd skins, half a teaspoon of salt and the remaining two teaspoons of sesame oil. Cook for five minutes, until the beancurd starts to crisp up, then take off the heat.To assemble, put the noodles in the centre of a lipped bowl, arrange the chicory, herbs, beancurd skin, clementine slices and pickled ginger around the outside, then scatter over the cashews and crispy onions. Pour over the dressing, then encourage everyone to arm themselves with chopsticks and toss the salad together – and, if willing, shout, “Lo Hei!”Explore more on these topicsVegetablesMeera Sodha recipesFoodVegan food and drinkNoodlesSaladChinese food and drinkMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

Short days, cold evenings and the pressure of everyday work mean that preparation is no longer about producing abundance, but about reducing effort while maintaining care. For many households balancing jobs, children and long commutes, the question is not what to cook, but how to make the month manageable.The most effective approach to Ramadan cooking is not variety but repetition. A small set of meals that are easy to digest, quick to prepare and gentle on the body can carry a household through 30 days of fasting with far less stress than daily reinvention. The aim is to do the thinking once, not every day.At the centre of this approach sits one essential dish: soup.Across cultures, soup is the quiet constant of Ramadan. In winter, it becomes indispensable. Warm, hydrating and calming, it allows the body to transition gently into eating after a long fast. A splitred lentil soupis particularly suited to February fasting. It is affordable, quick to cook and freezes well. One pot prepared at the weekend can last several days, removing the need for daily decisions at sunset.Served hot at iftar, the evening meal that breaks the daily fast, soup slows the pace of eating and settles the stomach before anything else arrives on the table. This is not about tradition for tradition’s sake but function. In colder weather, digestion naturally slows, and soup prepares the body to eat again.Fried food often features at iftar and scale matters. One or two small items are enough. Anything more becomes tiring to cook and heavy to eat night after night. Lebanese sambousek – small pastries filled with minced lamb, onions, parsley and pine nuts – work particularly well because they can be prepared in advance and frozen uncooked. The same applies to simple cheese rolls.Both can be shaped in batches, frozen flat and cooked directly from frozen when needed. The advantage is as much psychological as practical. When the freezer is stocked, there is no sense of last-minute pressure as the fast ends.Heavier fried dishes, such as fried chicken or fish, are best avoided during the week. They require more effort in the kitchen and tend to increase thirst the following day. Ramadan food works best when it is light and predictable.A fresh salad is not an optional extra but a structural part of the meal. It brings hydration, texture and acidity, balancing both soup and fried items.Fattoushremains a reliable choice: herbs, vegetables, crisp bread and lemon. Alternatively, a simple salad with chicken, lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers can stand alone for smaller households.The key is to keep ingredients repeatable and easy to assemble. Washing and storing vegetables at the start of the week turns salad into a matter of minutes rather than another task to negotiate at the end of the day.Rice, if served, should remain uncomplicated. Plain basmati rice, steamed and fluffed, provides comfort without heaviness. Rich, elaborate dishes are better reserved for weekends, when there is more time and less cumulative fatigue.Suhoor, the pre-dawn meal eaten before the fast begins, presents a quieter challenge in winter. Cold weather can disguise dehydration, yet long fasting hours still demand careful hydration. The most effective suhoor foods are simple. Medjool dates soaked 10-15 minutes in milk offer a practical solution. Soft, nourishing and quick, they require no preparation in the early hours. Limiting intake to two or three dates helps avoid sugar spikes and thirst later in the day.Much of this approach depends on one small window of preparation. A single Sunday afternoon can remove most of the strain of the week ahead. Cooking a pot of lentil soup, shaping sambousek, rolling cheese pastries and washing vegetables once creates a rhythm that carries through Ramadan with minimal daily effort.This way of cooking is not about perfection or performance. It is about acknowledging that fasting already demands discipline, and that food should support rather than complicate the month. In winter especially, Ramadan rewards calm repetition. When meals are planned, familiar and gentle, there is more space for rest, reflection and the quieter rhythms that the month invites.Lebaneselambsambousek (pictured above)These sambousek use a soft cream-based dough that is easy to handle and produces a tender, delicate pastry.Makes20–24Prep40 minCook20 minFor the dough300g extra-thick double cream250g – 300gplain flour, plus extra for dustingFor the lamb filling2 tbsp neutraloil1 small onion, finely chopped300g minced lamb2 tbsp pine nuts1 small bunch parsley, finely chopped¼ tsp ground cinnamon¼ tspallspiceSea saltTo make the dough, add the cream and 250g of the flour to a medium bowl. Mix until a soft dough begins to form, then gradually add the remaining flour, a little at a time, until you have a smooth, supple dough that is soft to the touch but not sticky. You may not need all the flour. Cover and set aside to rest for 15 minutes while you prepare the filling.Heat the oil in a frying pan on a medium heat, add the onion and cook for 10 minutes until softened and slightly golden. Add the minced lamb and cook for 10-12 minutes until just browned, breaking it up with a spoon. Stir in the pine nuts, parsley, cinnamon, allspice, and salt to taste. Cook for another minute, then remove from the heat and set aside to cool completely.On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough until it’s 1–1.5 cm thick. Cut out small or medium circles. Place a teaspoon of filling in the centre of each, fold into a crescent and seal the edges by pressing, crimping or using a fork.Freeze in a single layer for up to three months, or fry immediately in hot oil for 3-4 minutes, turning once, until golden and crisp (allow an extra 5 minutes if frying from frozen).LebanesecheeserollsView image in fullscreenLebanese cheese rolls.Photograph: Lina Saad/PRThese crisp rolls appear across the Middle East in various forms and are a staple of the Ramadan table.

But lifestyle choices such as screen time and smoking can affect your vision. Here, ophthalmologists share their tips on maintaining healthy eyes, from sight tests to sunglasses.Seek help, fast“The front of the eye, and the cornea in particular, has more nerve endings per millimetre square than anywhere else in the body,” says Dr Dilani Siriwardena, a consultant NHS ophthalmologist at Moorfields eye hospital in London and vice-president of theRoyal College of Ophthalmologists. “So it can be very sensitive. The tiniest scratch or piece of grit in your eye can feel like a brick.”While you should take any changes to eye health seriously, says Siriwardena, it is important not to rush to hospital unnecessarily. “Around 40% of eye casualty attendances are due to issues with the front of the eye that could be managed either by the patient themselves or with advice from a pharmacy or an optician. It is about judging for yourself the severity.”Dr Meera Radia, a consultant ophthalmologist at Imperial College healthcare NHS trust, recommends visiting a pharmacy for guidance on conjunctivitis, styes or dry eye. With any changes in vision,flashes and floaters, or headaches, an optician is usually the best first port of call, “to check eye pressure, the retina and optic nerve”, says Radia. They can provide eye drops, or refer you to hospital where necessary. “Think about opticians as a GP for your eye,” says Dr Zaria Ali, an ophthalmologist at Manchester Royal eye hospital.If you have a sudden loss of vision, or have a serious injury to your eye, such as a laceration or chemical injury, go straight to your nearest A&E, which can refer you to an ophthalmologist if needed. “If a chemical goes in your eye, most first-aid kits should have an eye wash, so do that right away, then go to hospital,” says Siriwardena.Make sure someone else drives you to hospital, Ali says: “We might need to put dilating eye drops in, which can blur your vision. You’re not going to be covered by insurance if that happens.”Get regular eye testsView image in fullscreenYou may be eligible for a free test.Photograph: Aire Images/Getty ImagesEven if you have good vision, “the number one thing to do to look after your eyes is to have a sight test every two years”, says Siriwardena.Choose a local optician that you feel comfortable with, says Radia, “and they can pick up on changes in your prescription, cataracts or potentially silent conditions”.Don’t be put off by the expense, Siriwardena adds: “Some people will be eligible for a free sight test and it doesn’t necessarily mean that you’ll have to buy glasses, but it is worth checking your eye health”. Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness in the UK, and Siriwardena says opticians can pick that up early.“A lot of people don’t realise that their vision doesn’t meet driving standards,” says Ali, “so it’s really important to go to your optician to find out your vision isbetter than 6/12” – the minimum standard for good eyesight, usually measured by an eye chart. In the UK, “children are invited to eye screenings at the age of four or five. Parents can decline but I very much encourage them to participate, because you can pick up problems that can be fixed. If you ignore it and you miss the cutoff for when vision stops developing at around age seven or eight, your child is then going to have bad vision in that eye permanently.”Put safety firstView image in fullscreenInvest in industrial-grade safety goggles.Photograph: Halfpoint Images/Getty ImagesDoing DIY or construction work? Always protect your eyes. “Every day, in eye A&E, we see at least 100 patients in our walk-in service,” says Radia, “and three to five of them will be construction workers who have landed something in the eyes, or people who have been doing DIY at home. So try to make sure you buy industrial-grade safety goggles if you’re going to take on work where things might be flying about, such as wood and especially metal – we see a lot of metallic foreign bodies in the cornea.”You even need to be careful when gardening, says Ali: “We’ve had people come in where a thorn’s gone right into their eye.” She also recommends protective eyewear when welding or doing snow sports: “You can getarc eye[a condition caused by unprotected exposure to bright flashes of UV light], which is quite painful.”Wear shadesView image in fullscreenLook out for labels such as UV400.Photograph: Alrphoto/Getty ImagesIn sunny conditions, put your sunglasses on, whatever the time of year. “Just as we lather our skin with SPF, we need UV eye protection as well,” says Radia. “When you are looking to buy a trendy pair of sunglasses, always check that there is UVA or UVB sun protection by looking out for labels such asUV400, which covers both.” Exposure can cause macular degeneration and early cataract development, among other issues, says Radia.Follow the 20-20-20 ruleView image in fullscreenYou blink less when looking at a screen.Photograph: George Pachantouris/Getty ImagesRadia is often asked about how to avoid the kind of eyestrain that comes from excessiveworking and playing on screens so much. “Blue light from screens doesn’t really cause eye disease or significant strain,” says Radia. “It is more the screen time itself.” To combat this, she advises following a 20-20-20 rule. “Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and stare 20ft away. It doesn’t have to be a hard and fast rule of 20 minutes, but just keep it in your head.”“When you use a screen, you blink 50-60% less, so that means your eyes are going to dry out even more,” says Ali. “If you’re getting that dry feeling and tiredness, keep dry-eye drops next to your computer; then you’ll remember to put them in.” Your setup should be as comfortable as possible: “Make sure your screen is at the right brightness for you,” says Ali. “There should not be a lot of glare. Have good lighting. Enlarge the text if you need to. If you’ve been told you need glasses for your computer, wear them” – even if you don’t like how they look on a Zoom call.Go outsideView image in fullscreenOutdoor play benefits developing eyes.Photograph: Jupiterimages/Getty Images“We’re seeing a massive explosion of myopia or shortsightedness, and the need to start wearing glasses for distance vision, quite early on among children,” says Radia. “Because we have smartphones, iPads, streaming – this is all to the detriment of the development of our vision.” Close work on tablets and phones is the worst offender, but watching TV for six hours isn’t ideal either. The solution? Get kids to play outside more. “There is evidence to suggesttwo hours a dayof outdoor play will benefit children’s developing eyes and lower the rate or risk of developing myopia,” says Radia.Do not rub growing eyesView image in fullscreenConstant rubbing can lead to keratoconus.Photograph: Click&Boo/Getty ImagesAs tempting as it is to rub an irritated eye, it is crucial that kids and young teenagers don’t, explains Radia, “as the cornea and the eyes are growing. If your child suffers from hay fever, or has asthma or eczema, and they get really itchy eyes, take them to the GP or optician for a prescription of anti-allergy eye drops or dry-eye drops. The risk of rubbing the eyes constantly can lead to a condition called keratoconus, where the cornea grows in a more conical shape.”Try a warm compress“If you start to get eyelid lumps, or a pharmacist or optometrist has told you that you’ve got inflammation of your eyelids with blepharitis, doing a hot compress is sensible,” says Siriwardena.“Get a clean flannel and warm water – from the tap is fine,” says Radia. “Heat up your eyelids with the cloth for two to three minutes, wrap the flannel around your finger, and then just gently massage from inside to outside on the upper lid and the lower lid. You’re trying to milk the oil glands so that they are less inflamed, less blocked, and secrete a natural oil that coats the tears and prevents them from drying out through evaporation.”Don’t smoke“Another leading cause of sight loss is from age-related macular degeneration, andsmoking is one of the biggest risk factors for that. So not smoking is really good for your eyes,” says Siriwardena.Eat your greens“Having a sensible diet, controlling your blood pressure and doing exercise are all good for your eye health,” says Siriwardena. Is there anything special you should eat that will help? For someone without an eye condition, no, says Siriwardena. “If you’ve got age-related macular degeneration,diets that are rich in leafy greens and polyphenolscan be good for you.”“Eating a wholesome, vitamin-rich diet with lots of fruit and vegetables is going to serve you well,” says Radia, adding that carrots can genuinely be good for the eyes thanks to their vitamin A content, but probably won’t help you to see in the dark. Type 2 diabetes affects eyesight and people with the condition may need more frequent eye tests, she adds.Staying hydrated can prevent dry eyes, says Ali: “Drink plenty of water, because that affects tear production. If you don’t drink enough, your body will prioritise water for everything else other than your eyes.”Don’t overwear contact lensesView image in fullscreenDon’t sleep, swim or shower in contact lenses.Photograph: Guido Mieth/Getty ImagesBe sensible about changing your contacts. “One of the biggest causes of people coming to eye casualty [are issues] related to contact lenses,” says Siriwardena. “Not wearing them properly, wearing them for too long, not taking them out, not cleaning them, not changing them frequently enough.” Ten hours is about the longest you should go before changing your contacts.Reassuringly, it is impossible to lose a contact in your eye, she says: it will always be in there somewhere, or have fallen out.“Swimming in contact lenses isn’t something you should do,” adds Siriwardena. “If you love swimming, get yourself some goggles that correct your vision.” Radia takes a more extreme position of not even showering in contacts: “We recommend a blanket rule: don’t sleep, shower or swim in your contact lenses, because of the infection risk.”Use eye makeup with cautionIf you are a big wearer of mascara, eyeshadow or eyeliner, “make sure you look at when it expires – it should have a circle with six or 12 [months] on it”, says Ali. Discard it if you have had it longer than that. “Make sure you take your makeup off before you go to bed,” continues Ali. “If you do get things such as eye swelling, try to avoid using, or get an allergy test.” Fake eyelashes and extensions can increase the risk of blepharitis, so use with caution.Rest your eyes“If you are tired, your eyes will feel sore and gritty because you haven’t had enough sleep and maybe your tear film isn’t good enough, causing dry eye,” says Siriwardena. “Sometimes they might get twitchy from tiredness, or too much caffeine or alcohol. Sleep helps, or just trying to relax your eyes, lying down and closing them, even if you don’t sleep – at least your eyes are resting.”This article was amended on 13 February 2026. Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness in the UK, but not the leading cause as an earlier version said. In the UK, the leading cause is age-related macular degeneration. In addition, an earlier version misquoted Dr Zaria Ali; she said that eye drops “can blur your vision” not “blow your vision”.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingThe expertsHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Kors’ best dressed list is the “amazing, remarkable”Rama Duwaji, the city’s first lady as wife of the mayor, Zohran Mamdani.“The way she dresses takes me back to the first term of the Obamas, so smart and so chic,” Kors said before the show. “Before that time, a first lady portrait meant a suit with puff sleeves and a bow and some pearls, and then all of a sudden there was Mrs Obama, wearing a simple jersey dress with her arms bare. It was modern.”View image in fullscreenThe ‘amazing’ Rama Duwaji with her husband, the mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani.Photograph: Heather Khalifa/APAnother “magicalNew Yorkwoman” on Kors’ list was Christy Turlington, who starred in the designer’s first advertisements as a teenage supermodel and, at 57, closed this show in caped, floor-length inky sequins. Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, back in the spotlight as the subject of a new Ryan Murphy drama, was on the mood board, along with Maria Callas – “the girl from Queens who became the greatest diva in the world”.One man made Kors’ list of muses: “A$AP Rocky, because he is just the most glamorous New Yorker right now.” Uma Thurman, Leslie Bibb, Mary J Blige andDakota Fanningwere on the front row.View image in fullscreenChristy Turlington closed the Michael Kors show at the Metropolitan Opera House.Photograph: Gilbert Flores/WWD/GettyBackstage, Kors added another reason to celebrate. The Pride flag at the Stonewall Monument in Greenwich Village, which commemorates the1969 Stonewall riotand the birth of the LGBTQ+ movement in the city, was taken down earlier this month under Trump administration orders. “That is criminal,” said Kors. Hours before his show, city officials raised the flag again. “In New York, we get back up and we push forward. That’s what we do. I am a born and bred New Yorker and proud. So let’s have a cheeseburger and a martini and listen to some piano music!”Kors likes to take a good hard swing when he steps up to the plate. There were opera gloves, cummerbund-wrapped tuxedos and gowns with diva-ish sweeping trains. The theme of a night at the opera was soundtracked by Prokofiev’s Romeo and Juliet mixed with Sia’s Chandelier, Tchaikovsky’s theme from Swan Lake spliced with the Rihanna song Diamonds. Kors took his bow to Native New Yorker by Odyssey.View image in fullscreenMichael Kors makes an appearance after presenting his collection.Photograph: WWD/GettyThe Kors world is one that requires an “entrance maker” for evening. “It drives me crazy how boring people look when it’s cold. Ugly boots, a big nylon coat – ugh! In winter, your coat is your calling card,” the designer said before the show. His proposals: a white shearling to shrug over your little black dress, perhaps, or a portrait-collared, wine-hued cashmere pea coat (“I love something that frames the face.”) There were more sober looks – grey tailored trousers with a simple red sweater looked almost Prada-licious – but this was a jazz-hands kind of night.But not everyone is in a party mood. New York fashion week is battling a challenging economic climate. Tariffs have wreaked havoc on global supply chains and consumer confidence. Saks Fifth Avenuefiled for bankruptcylast month and on the first day of catwalk shows in the city, it announced the closure of eight Saks stores and one Neiman Marcus location. The largest single unsecured creditor is Chanel, which is owed $136m (£100m), but it is smaller independent brands that are hardest hit, with many uncertain of being paid for orders that have been delivered, and facing a season with no new Saks orders. The bankruptcy has thrown into sharp relief the vulnerability of an industry structure built around the once mighty department store model.View image in fullscreenThe model Amelia Gray walking in the show.Photograph: Gilbert Flores/WWD/GettyThe bi-annual round of global fashion shows, which were devised primarily to serve the department stores who brought their chequebooks, are increasingly becoming a marketing opportunity for the megabrands who can afford them, and an unaffordable luxury for smaller designers.Steven Kolb, the chief executive of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, listed “the Saks bankruptcy, tariffs, inflation, geopolitical tension” as difficulties to be overcome. “Despite the cold, despite tariffs, despite bankruptcy, people are going to show up with their best creative ideas like we always have,” he told Vogue.Explore more on these topicsFashion weeksNew York fashion weekNew YorkUma ThurmanMary J BligeDakota FanningnewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Most primetimeNFLgames’ coverage start hours before kick-off, as photographers, fans and pundits alike pore over players’ sartorial choices just as they would their missed tackles and spectacular catches.Iconic looks range from Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow ina tailored tiger-print suitto eccentric Patriots wide receiver Mack Hollins turning up this year barefoot ina full prison jumpsuitcomplete with leg cuffs. Former quarterback Cam Newton is arguably the GOAT of the genre having achieved notoriety for his trademark colourful suits, oversized hats and statement glasses. The concept of the tunnel fit has now given rise to a cottage industry of stylists and brands who work with players to ensure they look game-ready and benefit from the eyeballs the moment generates. Last year Abercrombie & Fitch inked a multimillion dollar brand partnership with the NFL, reportedly in response to Travis Kelce signing on toendorse American Eagle, and player arrival posts on the@nfl Instagram accountroutinely receive over 100k likes. The tunnel fit trend has migrated to the English Premier League too, with Liverpool arriving for their game against Newcastle last month in head-to-toe Tommy Hilfiger, butthe Super Bowl takes this to another level, functioning as a Met Gala for men, especially now A-listers likeTaylor Swift (fiancee of Chiefs tight end Kelce)are on the makeshift catwalk.Founded in 1853, Goyard operates just 30 boutiques worldwide and refuses to sell online, making it genuinely difficult to acquire a bag even for those who can afford it. Want one? You’ll need to visit a boutique in person and it’s anybody’s guess whether they’ll actually be in stock.The most popular Goyard styles among NFL players are the Saïgon pouch (a clutch-style bag running £800-£1,200) and the Bellechasse (a crossbody/bum bag at £1,500-£2,000). Each features Goyard’s signature canvas, hand-painted by artisans in the brand’s Parisian workshop, a painstaking process that contributes to both mystique and price point. The bags are expensive but notably cheaper than Hermès Birkins (£8,000-£200,000 and more).The item has become what fashion insiders call a “unicorn bag”, a term which was originally applied to impossibly rare Hermès Birkins in unusual colours, but has expanded to describe any handbag that is rarely advertised and not available online.View image in fullscreenHold my pouch … Will Campbell and bag.Photograph: Kathryn Riley/Getty ImagesBut the most telling detail at this year’s Super Bowl wasn’t just that players carried Goyards – it waswhichplayers. The New England Patriots’ offensive tackles Morgan Moses and Will Campbell both clutched Goyard pouches as they arrived. Offensive tackles are among the least glamorous positions in American football – massive, workmanlike protectors whose job is to keep the quarterback upright. They don’t get the ball, don’t score touchdowns, don’t give post-match interviews, and earn significantly less than quarterbacks or wide receivers. In 2024, Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray made headlines forgiving designer bags as giftsincluding Goyards to his offensive linemen for Christmas, legitimising the item as a staple among players at all levels of the league. Since then the Goyard has become standard among professional athletes, with Premier League footballers includingReal Madrid star Jude BellinghamandEngland goalkeeper Jordan Pickfordat the forefront of the trend.Why have professional athletes, and NFL players in particular, embraced Goyard so comprehensively? Partly, it’s practical. These are big men who need big bags chock full of the toiletries, recovery gels and chargers necessary for long days at the stadium. They’re also genuinely unisex and devoid of obvious branding in a way that makes them easy to style with different outfits and more of a subtle flex, emblematic of thequiet luxury old-money aestheticthat has been dominant for a while.This shift towards practical luxury marks a broader evolution in how NFL players approach fashion. Player’s clothes have been scrutinised for decades, but became a serious cultural force in the early 2010s with millennial athletes who recognised style as an extension of their personal brand and a way of generating off-field income. They began working with professional stylists, collaborating with fashion brands, and treating game-day arrivals as content opportunities. For gen Z athletes who grew up idolising the likes ofNewtonandOdell Beckham Jr, pioneers of a brasher aesthetic that took its cues from hip-hop and skate culture, this has only accelerated.Social media means every arrival is dissected online, and access to luxury brands has never been easier. No one better reflects the league’s pivot towards a more global fashion-conscious outlook than Kelce. A savvy dresser since entering the league in 2014, he watched from the sidelines on Sunday in a £1,800 Fear of God blazer and sunglasses by Chrome Hearts, the cult brand made famous when Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jennerwore matching head-to-toe orange leather outfitsto the premiere of Marty Supreme.While there’s nothing new in young millionaires reaching for status symbols, the ubiquity of the Goyard bag reflects the fact gen Z’s preference for “if you know you know” displays of wealth has become codified. The bags are practical, prestigious, and, most importantly, they’re universally recognised by peers while remaining relatively opaque to outsiders. In a landscape where fashion has become as essential to athlete identity as on-field performance, unicorn bags have become part of the game-day uniform.To read the complete version of this newsletter – complete with this week’s trending topics in The Measure –subscribe to receive Fashion Statementin your inbox every Thursday.Explore more on these topicsFashionFashion Statement newsletterSuper Bowl LXNFLTravis KelceUS sportsnewslettersShareReuse this content"

We danced to two guitarists playing Justin Bieber’s Despacito with our 50 guests singing and dancing along with us. We watched as the sun began to melt into the Mediterranean Sea from this time-capsule hotel balancing on the edge of a cliff. I floated out of my body and felt a rush of euphoria – perhaps it was the limoncello spritzers.

The place is famously picturesque, but the island in the middle of the lake itself felt like a secret; quieter, stiller. It felt like ours for the evening. We climbed up the 99 steps to the Church of the Assumption, then sat on the worn stone as the sun dropped behind the Julian Alps, turning the lake amber and rose. Neither of us spoke. We didn’t need to.Tom CowieA second honeymoon in San SebastíanView image in fullscreenA view from Hotel Monte Igueldo.Photograph: JamesSan Sebastián always does it whatever your romantic life stage!

We enjoyed the cheap wine and clubbing till 4am. We went back in 2013 – a second honeymoon –Hotel Monte Igueldoon the cliff top (reached by funicular) still has the best view of any hotel we’ve ever been to.

Hopefully, you’ll work up an appetite in time for wonderful Bouillon de l’île, a vegetarian restaurant only open to 3pm. So delicious. Carry on strolling Le Marais and then chill with the Monet water lilies atMusée de l’Orangerie. The city centre is a lot more pedestrian and cycle-friendly these days.

Arriving at theDanieli Hotelin soaked kagouls but sporting our most charming smiles, we pleaded with the concierge to be allowed up to the hotel’s renowned roof terrace. Our reward? As the clouds finally parted, a glorious sunset and unrivalled panoramic views over tiny gondolas in San Marco basin, the Grand Canal, and the Venetian lagoon beyond.

It’s easy to find a quiet corner of the enormous grounds to sit and contemplate life together or while away an afternoon at the easygoing cafe enjoying the warm air and each other’s company. The palace is also a maze of fabulous courtyards and if your love language involves visiting scenes from Game of Thrones together, then this also ticks the boxes (the Real Alcázar was the setting for the Martell family’s gardens and palace in Dorne).Layla AstleyView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsTravelReaders' travel tipsTop 10sfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But when I realised that this column would appear on Valentine’s Day, I couldn’t resist the temptation to write about the plant that is perpetually intertwined with romance. Fortunately for me, roses happen to be edible.While technically the entire plant can be eaten, it’s best to stick to the petals, buds and hips (as if I had to tell you not to chomp on their thorns and woody stems). Fresh or dried, rose petals can be used to make rosewater or rose syrup, as pretty garnishes for cakes, and to infuse into sweet treats such as ice-cream and panna cotta. Rosebuds can be used this way too, but beware that by harvesting an entire bud you’re not going to get the rosehip developing later. Rosehips appear once a rose has bloomed and faded, and while they can be eaten raw, the seeds inside are surrounded by irritating hairs that should be discarded. To coax the flavour and abundant vitamin C from rosehips, make them into jellies, jams or syrups, steep them in hot water as a tea, infuse them into vinegar or spirits, or cook them into soups or sauces. As with all foraging-adjacent activities, remember there are many creatures that rely on these flowers and fruit, so leave plenty behind for the pollinators and birds.Don’t be tempted to eat the petals from roses you’ve bought from the shops, as they are likely to have been sprayed with chemicalsThe chill factor: why our plants need a sustained cold periodRead moreThe most affordable way to introduce roses into your garden is by acquiring them as bareroot plants, which ought to still be possible as we haven’t reached spring in the UK. Container-grown roses are available year-round, but expect them to be pricier. Pick a reasonably sunny and sheltered spot where the soil is free-draining, and ensure you have enough space for the eventual size of your chosen variety as they can range from compact and suitable for containers to rambling and happy to clamber up a tree.If you don’t have the room to plant a rose, please don’t be tempted to eat the petals from roses you’ve bought from the shops, as they are likely to have been sprayed with chemicals. Stick to the dried petals or buds that have been grown to be consumed.Sadly I don’t have access to a rose garden, so I can’t give you a rundown of my favourite varieties based on their nuanced flavour profiles. I did inherit a rose that produces large blooms that smell like peaches, and two volunteer dog roses (Rosa canina) that scramble through a hedge, so I’ll be trying those out come summertime.If you’ve ever eaten a turkish delight, it was likely made with the Damask rose. This variety is one of the most widely used for eating due to its fragrant pink petals. So if you want a rose that’s definitely worth growing to eat, you can’t go wrong with this classic.Explore more on these topicsGardening adviceGardensfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Just getting there is an adventure: it takes several planes, and about three to five days. Travelling there was a childhood dream of mine. I saw it as a way to test myself against something so much bigger. I nearly applied for a role at theBritish Antarctic Survey(BAS) 30 years ago, but then my wife and I were expecting our first child. Instead, I’ve worked as a chef in Michelin-star restaurants in Paris and London, hotels in Kuala Lumpur and St Moritz, and even at a school in Oxfordshire.In 2016, I took a sabbatical and finally joined BAS as a chef for a summer. Five years later, I went back for the winter, and last year, I became the organisation’s full-time catering manager. I felt ready for an adventure. Now I oversee the catering across BAS’s five Antarctic stations: bases for the organisation’s research and also where the staff live. Each year, I spend three months there; for the rest of the time I work at BAS’s HQ in Cambridge.There are four chefs at our main hub,Rothera, in the summer. We start the day by baking bread. We get through around 12kg of bread mix a day at high season. We serve breakfast, lunch and dinner, as well as “smoko” at 10am. It’s a traditional meal in the Antarctic: a fry-up with bacon rolls, beans, sausages, tomatoes and soups. The food intake is 5,000 calories a day. That’s about twice as much as a grown man would usually need, because the staff are often outside in the cold during the day, being extremely active.View image in fullscreenOlivier Hubert on a winter trip on Orca, a mountain on Adelaide Island, off the Antarctic peninsula.Photograph: courtesy of Olivier HubertWe are running a canteen, not a Michelin-star restaurant. The people here have no other option – it’s the only canteen for thousands of miles. But we take pride in our meals. As the staff are mostly British, we cook home comforts: toad in the hole, shepherd’s pie, fish and chips, curries, a roast every Sunday.On Saturdays, we push the boat out. We do restaurant food with tablecloths and candles. There’ll often be a theme. When we hosted a 1970s dinner party, we made something ghastly out of frankfurters and mash, plus slices of pineapple and glace cherries.View image in fullscreen‘Being there, your priorities shift’: in a BAS kitchen in Antarctica.Photograph: Olivier HubertYou might not think it, but we have a good range of products at our disposal. The food is frozen when it reaches us, so you need to thaw everything. Inevitably, this does affect the taste. With meat, fish or dairy, the quality remains high, but fruit and vegetables can lose their texture and crunch.Experience: a bear moved into my houseRead moreYou also have to be much more careful about managing what you’ve got. At Rothera station, there’s only one food delivery a year. I order bacon and sausages by the tonne. We’ve got walls of chopped tomatoes and tins of potatoes and all the basics. The dry food fills up to four 20ft-long shipping containers. Our frozen goods fill another one or two similar-sized freezers.Ours is a good, professional kitchen – you wouldn’t know you’re in the Antarctic unless you look through the window. We’ve got the most amazing view of the icebergs, sea and mountains.The continent is completely barren – the only thing you’ll see are emperor penguins. But on the peninsula, there’s lots of wildlife: all kinds of penguins, seals and whales. And then there’s the birds: skuas, albatrosses, petrels.The temperatures are a shock at first: on the ice shelf, it can reach -40C in the winter. When you join BAS, you get a massive kit bag with everything you need, and you’re trained how to look after yourself in the cold. The key is to wear the right kit, avoid getting wet, eat food rich in fat and sugar, and keep active.Being there, your priorities shift. You realise, in the words of French philosopher Jean Bodin, that “there is no wealth but in men”. A lot of the material things we covet don’t have that much value. Having to recycle, package and ship all our waste back home makes you aware of how wasteful our rich western societies have become.Coming back to the real world can be difficult. I struggle, thinking: do I fit in to this world any more? When you’re out there, you’ve got to remember how fortunate you are. It’s a privilege, and I remind myself to enjoy it to the fullest.As told to Emma MagnusDo you have an experience to share?

Po, originally from Russian-occupied Crimea, said she felt she had been dispossessed. “It’s as if someone has stolen my home. There is the same vibe as 2022.

It’s a humanitarian and national crisis. As a country we are in survival mode,” he said. Only one out of five DTEK power plants was currently connected to the electricity grid, he added, with repairs difficult because “everything is frozen”.Timchenko said Ukraine needed urgent international help. He said it required additional air defences, ammunition and an energy ceasefire – something Moscow briefly agreed to at Donald Trump’s request, before resuming bombing after a matter of days. “Kyiv has become the main target. We have lost all sources of power generation in the city. We are doing everything we can to keep the economy alive,” Timchenko said.View image in fullscreenOleh Yaruta, a DTEK engineer, who is fixing an underground power cableOleh Yaruta, a DTEK engineer, said the capital’s power grid was overloaded. It has suffered burnouts as people used electric heaters and boilers to stay warm. He was repairing an underground power cable. Hopping out from a hole, he produced an iPad. On it was a long list of pending repair jobs caused by outages across the capital. What did he think of Russians? “They are devils and orcs. They are bombing because they can’t conquer us,” he replied.Earlier this week electricity returned to some left bank buildings, with lights flickering on again for a few hours. Natasha Naboka said she had shared a bed in January with her 10-year-old daughter, Sofiia, and their yorkshire terrier, Bonya. “We were together under one blanket. Bonya wore a jacket. I woke up and my nose was frozen. It was 4-5C inside the flat.” She added: “Sofiia’s school was closed. For her it was an adventure.”View image in fullscreenNaboka in her kitchen during a blackoutView image in fullscreenNaboka and her daughter, Sofiia, in the kitchenWith no working fridge, Naboka has been leaving food out on her fifth-floor balcony. She washed clothes by hand and took them in a rucksack to dry in her workplace, a beauty parlour in central Kyiv, where the power situation is better. During air raids she and Sofiia moved to the corridor, she said, hiding between two walls. Her husband, a soldier, is based in Kharkiv oblast, another region badly affected by power breakdowns.Some Kyiv residents have criticised the city authorities for failing to protect infrastructure. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has pointed the finger at the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko,accusing him of doing too little. Naboka, however, said Russians were to blame. “They thought they could seize Ukraine very quickly. They failed. So instead Putin is trying to destroy us.” She added: “This is all about the jealousy and unhealthy ambition of one man.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineKyivRussiaEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The cloudy haze that settled over the valley was typical. So, too, was the chill of winter.There were no hints that the quiet and comfortable routine of daily life in the mountains would be irrevocably shattered in one of Canada’s worst acts of mass violence.The shops had been open for hours and students were midway through classes whena shooter opened fire and killed eight people, most of them young children.The attack unleashed a storm of grief, rage and disbelief that hangs heavy over the town. Hugs between friends linger tighter and longer. Grown men fall to their knees, their eyes red-rimmed at the injustice of it all. People are robbed of the ability to speak.“What do you even call this? What word is there for this?” said Don McKay, whose 17-year-old son, Duncan, was in gym class when the shooter arrived at the school and opened fire. Most students ignored the scattered bangs until a teacher came running into the gym and began frantically herding them into a storage room that he then locked. “I’ve encouraged him to speak to help make sense of it,” said McKay. “But it also helps. Because I just don’t have the words. Sometimes, for a moment, I do. But most of the time I can’t.”At a vigil on Wednesday night, the mayor, Darryl Krakowka, said crying was not a sign of weakness, but of strength, and the community needed to stay strong.View image in fullscreenDarryl Krakowka speaking to the media outside Tumbler Ridge town hall the day after the shooting.Photograph: Jennifer Gauthier/ReutersAfter police released a full list of victims, families began to publicly mourn a loss that remains both inconceivable and gut-wrenching in its cruelty.The children, between the ages of 12 and 13, wereremembered as dreamers, dancers, athletesand, in the case of Sarah Lampert’s daughter Ticaria, “an energiser bunny”. Ticaria was less than two months away from her 13th birthday when she was killed alongside her friend.“These were beautiful girls who didn’t deserve this,” said Lampert, holding up photographs of “my Tiki torch”.Tumbler Ridge map“She was a blazing light in the darkness. If you didn’t see her, you definitely heard her,” Lampert told reporters, adding that her daughter “just wanted to bring sunshine to everyone and everything she ever touched”.After slowly reading through her remarks with her daughter Niveya beside her, the mother of eight paused. “I don’t know what else to say,” she told the dozens of cameras trained on her.Two adults were also killed on Tuesday. Shannda Aviugana-Durand was an educational assistant who spent her days with the students at Tumbler Ridge secondary. Jennifer Strang was the mother of the shooter and four other children, including Emmett Jacobs, 11, who was also killed.View image in fullscreenSarah Lampert holds pictures of her daughter Ticaria Lampert, 12, one of the children killed.Photograph: Jennifer Gauthier/ReutersIn a town with fewer than 2,500 full-time residents, the shooting has tested the limits and scope of what community means. The unspoken promise of life in a place such as Tumbler Ridge, as one resident put it, is that “the town carries you when you need it”.But the town is now grappling with tragedy that is wider and deeper than most could have ever imagined, and an injustice perpetrated by one of its own.Jesse Van Rootselaar, whom investigators identified as the shooter,had a history of police visitsregarding mental health problems and firearms. Police said that Van Rootselaar was born as a biological male and had begun to transition to female and identified as female.She was twice taken for formal assessments. The premier of British Columbia, David Eby, said he had reached out to local health officials to ask for more details. At one point, police seized guns from the house but returned them after the owner – whom they did not identify – successfully appealed against the decision. Her firearms permit had expired in 2024 and was not renewed. Residents say Van Rootselaar, who dropped out of school four years ago, was reclusive. These revelations have angered residents, some of whom believe more could have been done to stop the attack.But, as in many places struck by tragedy, a sense of duty among residents – and those who have descended on the town to help – has prevailed.View image in fullscreenDavid Eby, the premier of British Columbia, and the minister of public safety, Nina Krieger, approach a memorial for the victims.Photograph: Jennifer Gauthier/ReutersThe town’s library has transformed into a gathering place for families to avoid the glare of news cameras. Thedinosaur museum, which in warmer months draws tourists with its collection of Triassic fossils, is closed to the public so that local people have a private space for grief counselling. Staff at the Twisted Seasons Bistro have donated more than C$1,500 in food to paramedics, police and anyone who looked as though a warm meal or coffee could bring a sliver of joy.“We’re close here. We’re family,” said Tiffany Hildebrandt, who spent what should have been her day off taking orders and clearing tables at the cafe.For outsiders, the town has been reduced to a single building where the horror unfolded: the red-brick school. But Tumbler Ridge was a special place, said Scott McKay, the brother of Don McKay. “There’s a reason I’ve lived here so long.”He hopes Mark Carney’s decision to attend a vigil – the first time a prime minister has ever visited Tumbler Ridge – alongside his political rival Pierre Poilievre captures the way in which tragedy has united the country.“They’re putting politics aside. They’re both fathers.”Residents have also received shreds of hopeful news. Cia Edmonds, whose daughter was airlifted to Vancouver after she was shot in the neck and head, posted on Facebook that Maya had moved for the first time in two days.“Its stimulus, a kick, a hand move, but its something!” she wrote. “Pray for our community. Pray for support. Pray for healing. Pray that all the young minds that are forced to live in memories, that they can grieve and eventually move forward with their heads held so high.”A day earlier she wrote: “It was just a normal day. What happened.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaTumbler Ridge school shootingAmericasMark CarneyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Louverture, who led the successful revolt that established the world’s first Black republic in 1804, had been central to Jean’s initial design.It follows the skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych beingbarred from the Gamesbecause of his “helmet of memory” in honour of Ukraine’s war dead. The IOC guidelines stipulate: “No kind of demonstration or political, religious, or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas.”The two-man Haitian delegation only received their uniforms the night before the opening ceremony. The kit had arrived straight from a workshop, where Italian artisans had been working around the clock to hand-paint the design on to technical sports fabric.View image in fullscreenVladyslav Heraskevych was barred from competing because of his helmet honouring Ukrainian athletes killed in Russia’s invasion.Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/AP“The uniforms are not just an exercise of style but an exercise of responsibility,” Jean said. “We had to concentrate positive messages about Haiti, our art, culture and history, within a few metres [of fabric].”The response to the ruling was swift and far-reaching. Images of the uniform spread quickly online, prompting messages of pride from the Haitian diaspora.‘A great wee place’: the small Scottish factory crafting Olympic curling stonesRead moreRather than abandoning the concept, Jean and her team returned the uniforms to the workshop and quickly repainted the garments to reference the painting – minus Louverture. The IOC approved the revised design just in time, featuring a riderless horse and a bright blue sky. “For 24 hours, I was in total despair – we had no budget, no time and this was our only chance to show Haiti in a positive light,” she says. “His absence spoke louder than his presence.”Jean refuses to be downbeat about the IOC’s decision to block her initial design. “The IOC did not lower the bar, it raised it and changed everything,” she says. “If it wasn’t for the rules, we would not have applied a higher degree of creativity or resilience.”View image in fullscreenTeam Haiti cross-country skier Stevenson Savart competing in the men’s sprint classic qualification.Photograph: Alex Slitz/Getty ImagesOther unique features of the kit’s design include the tignon, a women’s headwrap originating in west Africa that references how enslaved women were forced by colonisers to cover their hair. Jewellery is based on Creole earrings, which were among the few personal items enslaved people were permitted to carry from Africa. Large pockets nodded to the merchant culture of Haiti, where markets are the backbone of the economy.The uniforms are believed to be the only fully hand-painted ensemble at this year’s games. With rain forecast on the night of the ceremony, there were concerns about how the paint would hold. “We truly feared that during the ceremony, the paint might dissolve and reveal Toussaint’s face beneath, which made us laugh, but also made us reflect on the idea of our ancestors making themselves heard,” Jean said.“When we talk about Haiti, it’s immediately poverty,” Jean said. “We want to tell the world that we still exist, behind the earthquake, behind the disaster and the crisis that we are living in. We are so much more than this.” Now, she said: “If you search Haiti on the internet, the first images are our athletes and art, not the violent images that we usually find.”The cross-country skier Stevenson Savart said this week: “I felt so proud that it is difficult to describe. Walking in these clothes in front of the world and representing my small country was so amazing.”View image in fullscreenRichardson Viano, who competes in giant slalom and slalom, in 2022.Photograph: Piero Cruciatti/AFP/Getty ImagesRichardson Viano, an alpine skier, described the reference to Louverture as “a courageous message to send”. Adopted from an orphanage in Haiti, he said the uniform symbolised his “journey to the Olympic mountains”, adding that he hoped the country would be remembered for “its strength, resilience and values”.For Jean, the symbolism of their presence outweighed the results. “In the Olympic arena, we were all equal,” she said. “Haiti was no longer the poorest nation.

After the shooting on Wednesday, Canadian police identified the suspect as Jesse Van Rootselaar.Tumbler Ridge mapIn a statement to the Guardian, Roblox said: “We have removed the user account connected to this horrifying incident as well as any content associated with the suspect. We are committed to fully supporting law enforcement in their investigation.”The California-based company added that the “Mall experience” was accessible only through Roblox Studio, a separate app used by developers to create games. As a result, the simulator recorded just seven visits.Roblox also said it uses a combination of AI and a team of safety specialists to review content that is uploaded to its platform before it is shown to another user.Wednesday’s attack – one of Canada’s deadliest school shootings since the 1989 École Polytechnique massacre when a gunman killed 14 women – leftnine people deadin Tumbler Ridge, a small coalmining community.The victims included a teacher, five students, the suspect’s mother and her stepbrother. The suspect, who reportedly had a history of mental health issues, was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.This isn’t the first time Roblox has been criticised for its content. The platform allows its millions of users to create and share their own video games – many of them benign, featuring cartoon fish and campingtrips.However, it has also allegedly made Jeffrey Epstein-themed content available to children, and is facing alawsuitin California for facilitating the sexual exploitation and assault of minors.The links between violent video games and mass shootings have beenlong-debatedand remaininconclusive, with large studies finding at most a small correlation between gaming and real-world aggression.However, though games may not cause violence, recent incidents underscore the growing trend of “gamified violence”: extremists adopting elements of video game design in the context of real-world attacks.This is becomingincreasingly common. The attacker in the 2019 mosque shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, broadcast his massacre on Facebook. Aracially motivated shooting in Buffalo, New York, in 2022, was broadcast on Twitch, a platform that allows users to livestream themselves playing video games.This article was amended on 14 February 2026. An earlier version said there was more than one attacker in the Christchurch attack and incorrectly named the platform the attacker streamed on as Twitch.Explore more on these topicsTumbler Ridge school shootingCanadaAmericasGamesSoftwareRobloxAI (artificial intelligence)newsShareReuse this content"

On different occasions the suspect had been apprehended under the country’s mental health act for assessment and follow-up, he added.McDonald also said that at least one of the interactions with police related to weapons. “Police have attended that residence in the past, approximately a couple of years ago, where firearms were seized under the criminal code,” he said. “At a later point in time, the lawful owner of those firearms petitioned for those firearms to be returned and they were.”The suspect had a firearms licence that had expired in 2024 and did not have any firearms registered in her name, he said.Trent Ernst, publisher of Tumbler RidgeLines, the town’s biweekly newspaper, said one of the biggest frustrations in the community was the lack of medical support and in particular mental health services, in the town which lies more than 1,000km (600 miles) northeast of Vancouver“The majority of people that I’ve talked to are sad more at the fact that Tumbler Ridge doesn’t have the level of support for mental health and health services in general,” he said.“Right now, there are five mental health nurses in town. But this is the exception, and it’s an exceptional situation. There are times where we’ll go months, if not years, without having anybody in mental health services in town,” he said.Mourners braved frigid cold on Wednesday night to honour the victims, with Mayor Darryl Krakowka telling them, “It’s OK to cry.”Krakowka described the town as “one big family,” and encouraged people to reach out and support each other, especially the families of those who died in the attack. The community must support victims’ families “forever,” not only in the days and weeks to come, he said.With Associated Press and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsTumbler Ridge school shootingCanadaAmericasMark CarneynewsShareReuse this content"

The nine-day celebrations, the biggest holiday in China’s calendar, officially start on Sunday.While at the festive market, Xi picked up a 45 yuan (£4.79) bundle of delicacies from Daoxiangcun, a historic bakery known for its traditional snacks.According to the shopkeeper interviewed by Chinese media, Xi plumped for three items: honey-glazed dough twists, cream-filled dough twists and jujube flower pastries, a flakey, flower-shaped cookie with a filling made from red dates. Dough twists are made from fried pastry and are a popular local snack in Beijing.The shop has since been overrun by shoppers keen to get a slice of the Xi-approved pies.One customer, Zhao, bought 16 bags of the snacks, which are now being pre-packaged into Xi-themed triples. She told a reporter: “These are the same new year’s goods recommended by the general secretary, and people really like them. I want to buy some to give to my friends.”View image in fullscreenThe shop has since been overrun by shoppers keen to get a slice of the Xi-approved pies.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockXi is the general secretary of the Chinese Communist party (CCP), as well as being China’s president and thecommander of the armed forces.Daoxiangcun said its stores had to restock pastries to accommodate hungry and patriotic customers.Xi also visited a store called Yili Bakery and bought a 14 yuan loaf of fruit bread. He reportedly said that he had enjoyed Yili’s butter rolls as a child in Beijing’s hutongs, the traditional alleyways that crisscross the capital’s historic centre.Xi’s personal tastes have often inspired imitations. In 2022, there was aviral trendamong young people on social media of wearing “office and bureau style clothes”, ie the plain attire of a CCP bureaucrat, a tongue-in-cheek homage to the CCP’s highest-ranking cadre, the general secretary.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsXi JinpingChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The voiceover of the video says: “This is the world I know, defending the homeland and protecting the people. But day after day, the truth becomes increasingly obvious: what leaders are really protecting is their own self-interest.”Later, the officer says: “I could not let their madness be a part of my daughter’s future.”The video is the fifthMandarin-language recruitment advertpublished by the CIA since October 2024. The CIA director, John Ratcliffe, told Reuters that the videos reached many Chinese citizens, despite the fact that YouTube is blocked in China.

The purging of Zhang Youxia, once seen as Xi’s closest military ally, sent shock waves through western intelligence agencies. Liu Zhenli, another member of the PLA’s ruling body, the Central Military Commission, was also placed under investigation.The Guardian view on China’s military purge: the risks grow in an age of strongmen | EditorialRead moreSeveral other officers and senior defence officials have been defenestrated for suspected corruption or disloyalty to Xi in recent years, including the former defence ministerLi Shangfu.On Tuesday, Xi made rare comments acknowledging the turmoil in the PLA, saying the army had “undergone revolutionary tempering in the fight against corruption”. He also said the PLA rank and file had been loyal to the Chinese Communist party and had “proven themselves capable and dependable”.According toreports, the Chinese government wiped out much of the CIA’s spying network in China between 2010 and 2012, killing or imprisoning more than a dozen sources. The New York Timesreportedthat one of them was shot in front of his colleagues outside a government building as a warning to others who might have been working for the CIA.Lin Jian, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, said: “China will take all necessary measures to resolutely combat the infiltration and sabotage activities of anti-China forces abroad. We are determined to safeguard our national sovereignty, security and development interests; the schemes of anti-China forces will not succeed.”Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsCIAUS militaryChinaXi JinpingAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2025 it inspected a Taiwanese and South Korean vessel as part of a crackdown on illegal fishing.The Chinese boat’s 47-year-old skipper was arrested on suspicion of attempting to evade an onboard inspection by a Japanese fisheries control officer. The Nikkei business newspaper said the vessel appeared to have been fishing for mackerel.“The vessel’s captain was ordered to stop for an inspection by a fisheries inspector, but [it] failed to comply and fled,” the agency said in a statement. “Consequently, the captain was arrested.”Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Minoru Kihara, told reporters on Friday: “We will continue to take resolute action in our enforcement activities to prevent and deter illegal fishing operations by foreign vessels.”The foreign ministry in Beijing urged Japan to protect the crew members’ rights, adding that the Chinese government required the country’s fishers to operate in accordance with the law. “It is hoped Japan strictly respects the China-Japan fisheries agreement, fairly enforces the law and safeguards the safety and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese crew members,” the ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, told a news conference.The incident comes at a tense time for bilateral ties, weeks after Japan’s prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, sparked a furious row over the future ofTaiwan.Speaking to MPs in November, Takaichi said Japan couldbecome militarily involvedin the event of an attempted Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Takaichi, who is regarded as a China hawk, said her country’s self-defence forces could be deployed if a crisis in the Taiwan Strait created a “survival-threatening situation” for Japan.The remarks, which she has refused to withdraw, prompted Beijing to call on Chinese nationalsnot to travel to Japanas tourists or students, and led to the cancellation of cultural events.The dispute is also thought to be behind the decision not to send giant pandas to Japan – a goodwill gesture in place since the countries normalised diplomatic ties in 1972 – after thedeparture of two of the animalsfrom a Tokyo zoo last month.China and Japan are also embroiled in a longstanding territorial dispute that has been exacerbated by the actions of fishers. In 2010, thearrest of the captainof a Chinese boat near the disputedSenkaku islandstriggered a major diplomatic row. The captain, whose boat had collided with a Japanese inspection vessel, was later released without charge.Recent media reports claimed that the government in Tokyo had privately urged Japanese fishers to steer clear of the Senkakus to avoid provoking China. The uninhabited islands, which are surrounded by rich fishing grounds, are administered by Japan but claimed by China, where they are known as the Diaoyu.Officials in Japan, whose westernmost islandYonagunilies just 110km from Taiwan, believe a crisis surrounding the self-governed democracy could quickly threaten Japanese security.China insists that Taiwan is part of its territory and has not ruled out force to achieve “reunification”.The Taiwanese president, Lai Ching-te, warned this week that other parts of the region would be targeted by China if it succeeded in seizing Taiwan.Beijing would become “more aggressive, undermining peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific and the rules-based international order”, he said in an interview with Agence France-Presse. “The next countries under threat would be Japan, the Philippines and others in the Indo-Pacific region, with repercussions eventually reaching the Americas and Europe.”In response to Takaichi’s comments, Beijing conducted joint air drills with Russia, and in December jets from China’s Liaoning aircraft carrier twicelocked radaron Japanese aircraft in international waters near the southern island ofOkinawa.Takaichi, whose Liberal Democratic partywon last week’s lower house electionsby a landslide – partly on the back of strong public support for her stance on China – said this week she was “open to dialogue” with Beijing.China’s foreign ministry said talks could not take place as long as Takaichi continued to choose “confrontation”. “If Japan truly wants to develop a strategic and mutually beneficial relationship with China, it’s very easy and clear: withdraw Takaichi’s erroneous remarks about Taiwan,” Lin said.With Agence France-Presse.

Taylor’s primary priority is to stop the haemorrhaging of votes, and to win back those – women in metropolitan and regional seats, for example – who were once dependable supporters.Sussan Ley had the second shortest tenure as Liberal party leader – One Big ChartRead moreSpeaking at Parliament House after Friday’s ballot, Hume said she knew people had lost faith in the party thatopinion polls suggest would be decimatedeven further if an election were held today.“The Liberal party is a party of hope and it is a party of aspiration, but most importantly is a party for all Australians, together, with Angus as our leader,” she said.While Hume sided with Taylor in the leadership spill, it’s important to note she did not run on a joint ticket with him.Hume’s return to the shadow ministry also means the moderate wing still holds influence federally – the role is second-in-charge to Taylor, a leading economic and social conservative within the Liberals.Hume’s elevation could also impact who ends up as the opposition’s Senate leader. The role is held by Michaelia Cash but is decided by the party’s upper house members. A deputy leader, however, doesn’t automatically need to run for Senate leadership.A decade in the makingHume’s rise to the (almost) top hasn’t been without its share of bumps along the way.In the Morrison government, Hume served as minister for women’s economic security, superannuation, financial services and the digital economy.Following the Liberals’ heavy loss in 2022, the 54-year-old took up the finance and public service portfolios and became the shadow special minister of state during Peter Dutton’s time as opposition leader.But the relatively unblemished run came to a halt during the 2025 election campaign when Hume was credited with drafting the disastrously unpopular policy toend working from home entitlementsfor public servants.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe policy wasdumped a month laterbut comparisons between the Trump administration’s department of government efficiency (Doge) in the US and Dutton’s public service policies continued to haunt the Liberals.In the final week of the campaign, Hume claimed on Channel Seven’s Sunrise that some Chinese Australians handing out how-to-vote cards for Labor may have been “Chinese spies”. The commentsdrew sharp criticismand experts suggested itcould have contributed to swingsagainst the Liberals in seats with significant Chinese Australian populations.After Ley took the reins following Dutton’s loss in the 2025 election, Hume was dropped from the frontbench. Manysaw this as a clear demotionowing to her campaign performance.Despite being a senior moderate, Hume didn’t shy away from the occasional veiled swipe at Ley.When Ley called for the Australian ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, to besacked from the roleafter a curt encounter with US president Donald Trump, Hume described the opposition leader’s demands as a “little bit churlish”.In the following week, Hume said she didn’t like to “tell people what it is that they should and shouldn’t wear” when Ley was on awarpath about Anthony Albanese’s Joy Division T-shirt.A ‘talented’ operator with quick witHume has been lauded by her colleagues, publicly and privately, as a great public performer with cut-through. Even Ley described her as “enormously talented, fantastic” as she demoted her from the frontbench.In Senate estimates this week, Hume pointed out condoms were for sale in the women’s bathrooms at the Parliament House gym but not the men’s. Public officials quipped it was “absolutely wonderful that women are taking care of their sexual health”.“I just wonder why men aren’t taking responsibility as well,” Hume said in response.But even the most experienced operators have their moments.Hume’s quick wit and penchant for a joke has landed her in uncomfortable situations, such as when sheapologised to the Asic chair, Joseph Longo, in June 2024for wearing Lycra in the gym they both frequent.0:40'Less worthy men have seen me in far less': Senator Hume gets personal in estimates – video“Less worthy men have seen me in far less,” Hume said before revealing a shocked expression. “Sorry, forgot myself for a moment.”The Victorian senator alsodidn’t shy from making a jab at the Coalition’s junior partnerin October last year when she said she was “too fond of good coffee and free markets” to join the Nationals.“Well, look, I do look very fetching in an Akubra … I’ll tell you that much. And I’d have to speak a lot slower and talk about the regions more often down in cocky’s corner,” Hume told Channel Seven’s Sunrise.View image in fullscreenHume with Julia Banks, then the member for Chisholm, in 2016.Photograph: Mike Bowers/The GuardianOutside political life, Hume has three children with her former husband. All are in their late teens or early 20s.Sussan Ley is today’s scapegoat - but she was never the Liberals’ core problem | Tony BarryRead moreHume has a long-term partner but toldthe Australian Financial Review in 2022she prefers to keep any details about the relationship private.“I think I got the last mid-50s, Oxford-educated, heterosexual lawyer – never married, no kids – in Australia,” she said.Hume joined the Liberal party in the early 2000s, becoming the secretary and then president of the party’s affluent Armadale branch in Melbourne’s inner-east.She served in a number of administrative roles across the party before entering the Senate in 2016. While she lost to then-28-year-old James Paterson for the top spot on the Senate ticket, she became the Coalition’s fifth senator in Victoria due to a double dissolution.Hume was re-elected to the Senate in 2025 for another six-year term so bar any unexpected scandals or life events, we can expect the new deputy leader to be around for some time.Explore more on these topicsLiberal partyAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Mitchell eventually made landfall in westernmost Western Australia, weakening back to a tropical low. Lingering moisture from Mitchell fuelled further stormy weather across southern Western Australia on Monday, bringing heavy rain and wind damage to farms and businesses.View image in fullscreenA man stands on top of the roof of a building in Toamasina on the east coast of Madagascar, which was hit by Tropical Cyclone Gezani on 12 February.Photograph: Tsiky Sikonina/AFP/GettyCyclone Gezani made landfall on Madagascar’s east coast on Tuesday, causing major flooding and damaging hundreds of buildings, with winds of 155mph recorded near the city centre of Toamasina. Gezani weakened after making landfall but continued to sweep across the island, killing at least35 peopleand displacing more than 2,500. Gezani is the second cyclone to hit Madagascar this year, after Tropical Cyclone Fytia just 10 days ago, which killed 14 people and displaced 31,000.Meanwhile, the blocked weather pattern acrossEurope, which brought the very wet start to the year for the west and south-west of the continent, has had the opposite effect farther north-east. Under the influence of persistent high pressure over northern Europe, dry and cold conditions prevailed in large parts of Scandinavia, the Baltics and eastern Europe, resulting in the continent’s coldest January since 2010.View image in fullscreenA commuter train arrives at Helsinki central railway station in a heavy snow storm on 6 February.Photograph: Mikko Palonkorpi/AlamyTwo notable cold snaps produced the most extreme conditions. The first struck in early January in the far north, where temperatures plummeted to less than -40C. Tulppio inFinlandrecorded -42.8C on 9 January, followed by -41.5C in Karasjok in Norway on the 11 January. Flights were cancelled as deicing failed, leaving tourists stranded, while high demand for heating drove record electricity use.The second extreme cold spell developed in late January, again initially affecting northern Scandinavia, with temperatures falling to -35.6C in Utsjoki in Finland. Then, as low pressure pushed in from the east in early February, this Arctic air sank south into eastern Europe. In Lithuania temperatures fell to -34.3C on 1 February, while north-eastern Poland recorded a minimum of -27.7C, about 20C below the climate average. The prolonged cold spell allowed parts of the Baltic Sea to freeze over, with thick ice sheets forming in the Bay of Gdansk. This winter 38 people in Poland have died from hypothermia, double last year’s tally.Explore more on these topicsAustralia weatherWeather trackerMadagascarEuropeFinlandNorwayWestern AustraliaExtreme weatheranalysisShareReuse this content"

Company documents show a 1,557 hectare site has been identified as an area to be secured to “offset” the clearing.Among a list ofconditions imposed by the governmentdesigned to limit harm to threatened species, Middlemount has been asked to identify and then relocate any tree hollows used by the gliders.But ecologists said greater gliders – Australia’s largest gliding marsupial – would probably die because of the clearing and dismissed the plan to relocate their homes.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailProf Euan Ritchie, an ecologist at Deakin University, said: “Destroying the equivalent of 40 MCGs worth of greater glider habitat and then attempting to relocateallhollows and claim this somehow offsets the harm to greater gliders is genuinely deluded, and contemptuous.”He said if it was even possible to safely remove the tree hollows, relocating them would probably change their thermal properties and microclimate, “meaning gliders may no longer find them suitable, and hollows may be located in a tree or part of the tree they don’t prefer”.“Make no mistake, many greater gliders will die as a result of this action and ridiculous offset measure.“We can’t keep destroying the homes of threatened native wildlife and say we’re saving them by using ever more absurd and nonsensical mitigation approaches.”With every new or expanded coalmine they approve, the Albanese government is burning our futureDr Claire GronowProf David Lindenmayer, a forest ecologist at the Australian National University, echoed Ritchie’s concerns and said the mine approval “condemns these animals to die”.Habitat clearing and global heating are among the key threats facing the species, which wasdesignated endangered in 2022only six years after it first appeared on the national threatened species list.Middlemount is the second coalmine extension to be approved by the federal government this year after last month’s green light for the Meandu mine in Queensland that provides fuel to Tarong power stations.Dr Claire Gronow, the central Queensland coordinator for environment group Lock the Gate, said: “With every new or expanded coalmine they approve, the Albanese government is burning our future and burning their own credibility. Now is the time to be implementing an orderly transition away from coal, not approving massive expansions.”Charlie Cox, a campaigner at the Queensland Conservation Council, said: “The science is unwavering – digging and burning coal is fundamentally changing our climate, driving more frequent rain events and flooding.“Allowing Yancoal to extract and export another 236m tonnes of climate pollution tells Queenslanders the Albanese government does not care about our safety, our health, or our cost of living.”A federal government spokesperson said the approval of Middlemount had come with several strict conditions to minimise potential impacts.“The imposed conditions will ensure protection of water resources and listed threatened species and ecological communities. This includes mitigation measures like pre-clearance surveys, safe fauna crossing areas, defined clearing boundaries, weed and pest animal management, and tree hollow translocation. Offsets for residual significant impacts are also required.”A statement said the government was “strongly committed to action on climate change and our net zero targets”, adding the mine was already subject to the safeguard mechanism requiring it to reduce greenhouse emissions each year and reach net zero by 2050.The safeguard mechanism only impacts emissions occurring in Australia. The vast majority of the emissions from the mine will occur when the coal is burned overseas.The Guardian has approached Yancoal and Peabody for comment.Explore more on these topicsCoalQueenslandEnergyFossil fuelsAustralian politicsClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Please dress appropriately. Clothing must be worn over swimwear.”In a statement on Friday, the council cited legislation that allows council bus drivers to refuse entry where a passenger’s clothing is “likely to dirty or damage the vehicle, or cause inconvenience or damage to other passengers or the driver”.Australian women get into big bikini bottoms: ‘Everyone’s been overexposed’Read moreThis can include circumstances where “a passenger is wearing wet or sandy clothing that could impact the cleanliness and comfort of the shared transport environment”, a spokesperson said.When asked whether dry swimwear was permitted, a spokesperson said: “Council drivers cannot tell if swimwear is wet.”Sunrise’s clip, posted to social media, received a mixed reaction to the new rules.“Welcome to 1920s Sydney … oops 2020s,” one commenter said.Another said: “The Council should focus on their core business activities. Try not to be the fashion police.”But others agreed with the ban.“It has always been a golden rule that you cover swimwear if you walk more than a block across from the beach,” one said.Another claimed “the complaints started with the proliferation of Brazilian style really brief g strings”.Candy Bingham, the deputy mayor of the Northern Beaches council, told the Daily Telegraph that some swimwear is “confronting” to elderly passengers, especiallyfashionable“thong-style bikinis”.“The girls get on and all they have on is their bikinis,” she said. “People are worried about the hygiene aspect when they sit on the seats … swimmers, wet from the beach and covered in sand, make a mess and leave the seats damp.”In 2025, a council in the Blue Mountainsbanned G-string bikinis at its public poolsand said in a since deleted Facebook post: “thongs and G-string swimwear is not acceptable for males or females when visiting our leisure centres.”The ban sparked controversy in the comments, ranging from “if you don’t like it, don’t look” to “it’s about the rules … don’t like them? Then swim and bare your bum elsewhere.”Lauren Rosewarne, a cultural expert at the University of Melbourne’s school of social and political sciences, said the rule to “dress appropriately” reflects longstanding societal “fixed views” about public presentation.“These views aren’t inherently right or wrong, these are just opinions,” she said. “People have the right to complain, [but] that doesn’t mean a council should be obligated to respond.”More broadly Rosewarne said there was a persistent gender double standard where women’s bodies face far greater scrutiny and are often policed to ensure the “comfort” of others.“Women are expected to dress in ways that don’t excessively ‘tempt’ men,” she said. “To be aware that their bodies are constantly being appraised and thus that they are expected to don garments that don’t make other people feel uncomfortable.“The irony here is that if everyone minded their own business, if people weren’t so ready to look at women and judge their garment choices, most ‘discomfort’ would be eliminated.”Explore more on these topicsSydneyNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

This order, however imperfect it was even at its best, no longer exists in that form.”Switching to English to ram home his message, Merz said: “In the era of great power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone. Dear friends, being a part of Nato is not only Europe’s competitive advantage. It is also the United States’ competitive advantage.”“So let’s repair and revive transatlantic trust together,” he added.The German chancellor’s speech opened the annual gathering of top global security figures including many European leaders and the US secretary of state,Marco Rubio.At last year’s conference, held a few weeks into Trump’s second term, the US vice-president,JD Vance, stunned European leadersby lecturing them about the state of democracy and freedom of speech on the continent – a moment that set the tone for the last year.View image in fullscreenThe US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, met Friedrich Merz at a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the conference.Photograph: Liesa Johannssen/AFP/GettyA series of statements and moves from the Trump administration targeting allies has followed, including Trump’s threat last month to impose new tariffs on several European countries in a move tosecure US control of Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, a Nato ally.Merz drew most applause from an audience brimming with hostility toward US unilateralism when he directly criticised the current American administration, saying: “The culture war of the Maga movement is not ours. Freedom of speech ends here with us when that speech is directed against human dignity and the basic law. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade. We stand by climate agreements and the World Health Organization.”“In the age of great powers, our freedom is no longer a given. It is threatened,” he said, adding that “firmness and willpower will be needed to assert this freedom”. Challenging Trump’s unilateral style, Merz added: “Autocracies may have followers, democracies have partners and allies.”2:06Munich Security Conference 2026: where does the US-EU relationship stand? – videoAt the same time, he said Europe must cast off its excessive dependence on the US, emphasising: “We won’t do that by writing offNato.”He also urged the US president to recognise it was still possible toexhaust Russia economicallyand militarily, to the point where it was willing to come to the negotiating table over Ukraine.With Germany one of the European countries doing the most to boost its own defence spending, Merz clearly felt in a strong enough position to insist the US needed to do more to listen to European concerns about its security and the legitimacy of a sustained European pillar of Nato.Describing the Munich conference as a seismograph for the state of US-European relations, he said the Ukraine war “had forced Europe to return from a vacation from world history. Together we have entered an era that is once again marked by power and big-power politics.”CIA publishes recruitment video aimed at disaffected Chinese soldiersRead moreThese big powers, Merz said, “make their own rules. It is fast, harsh and often unpredictable. These powers exploit natural resources, technologies and supply chains using them as bargaining tools.”Merz was speaking as the fourth anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine approaches and one year after Vance used his speech in the same hall to criticise Europeans for not taking enough control of their own defence arrangements and ignoring the demands of their electorates.Merz responded by saying it was crucial for the continent to change its mindset and fully exploit the “enormous” military, political, economic and technological potential of a “sovereign Europe”. Germany was striving for “partnership-based leadership” in Europe but retained no “hegemonic fantasies”.View image in fullscreenThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, arrives at the conference in Munich.Photograph: Thomas Kienzle/APMerz said he had begun talks with Macron about a European nuclear deterrent. This, he said, must be firmly integrated into Nato’s nuclear arsenal and would not result in some parts of Europe being more defended than others. The chancellor stated that Germany was not abandoning Nato but wanted to establish a “strong, self-sustaining pillar” within the alliance.In his speech Macron insisted Europe must be at the table to negotiate a new arms control settlement with Russia covering ballistic missiles, deep strike capacity, defence technology and nuclear weapons.The French president said previous arms control treaties such as the now defunct INF Treaty were negotiated only by the US and this could not be repeated if Europe was to be taken seriously as a geopolitical power.He said initial talks about new European security architecture had already been held with the UK and Germany, but it was now time to broaden the consultations across Europe.0:53Emmanuel Macron: Time for Europe to become geopolitical power – videoMacron warned a Ukrainian peace settlement required applying extra pressure, but even if an agreement was reached Europe faced the challenge of how to “coexist with an unreconstructed aggressive Russia on our borders” that has “a bloated army and a defence industry on a sugar high”.Calling for a transparent independent European channel of communication with Russia, he said the post second world war security architecture had been “totally designed and framed during the cold war times” and needed a new articulation.Addressing the criticisms directed at Europe last year by Vance, Macron said “Europe has been vilified … as a repressive continent where speech is not free and where alternative facts cannot claim the same right of citizenship as truth itself – that outdated and cumbersome concept.”Explore more on these topicsFriedrich MerzNatoDonald TrumpMarco RubioJD VanceEmmanuel MacronNuclear weaponsnewsShareReuse this content"

Responding to the Rise of Populism”, Ocasio-Cortez decried the US-led war against Iraq as well as the development of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), calling instead for foreign countries to engage in a “working-class-centered politics” that would help “stave off the scourges of authoritarianism”.“I believe we’re seeing in economy across economy around the world, including the United States, that extreme levels of income inequality lead to social instability and drives in the sense in authoritarianism, rightwing populism and very dangerous domestic internal politics,” Ocasio-Cortez said during the panel, which also included European and Latin American lawmakers, as well as Petr Pavel, the Czech president.Ocasio-Cortez also said that she and her fellow Democrats were calling for a return to a “rules-based order” without the “hypocrisies” of US foreign policy that have dominated the past and current administrations.“Whether it is kidnapping a foreign head of state, whether it isthreatening our allies to colonize Greenland, whether it is looking the other way in a genocide, hypocrisies are vulnerabilities, and they threaten democracies globally,” she said.Ocasio-Cortez’s visit to Munich comes amid a government shutdown in the US that saw some US lawmakers cancel their plans for travel.Ocasio-Cortez was scheduled to appear later in a panel on the “future of foreign policy”. During her remarks, she said that the international tide in authoritarianism had been fueled “not just by income inequality, but the failure of democracies over decades to deliver, the failure to deliver higher higher wages, the failure to rein in corporations”.“This is a moment where we are seeing our presidential administration tear apart the transatlantic partnership,” she said. “What is happening is indeed very grave, and we are in a new era, domestically and globally … But that does not mean that the majority of Americans are ready to walk away from a rules-based order and that we’re ready to walk away from our commitment to democracy.”Explore more on these topicsAlexandria Ocasio-CortezUS foreign policyDonald TrumpMarco RubioEuropeGermanynewsShareReuse this content"

Asked if films can affect political change, Wenders said that “movies can change the world”but “not in a political way”.He added that film-makers “have to stay out of politics because if we make movies that are dedicatedly political, we enter the field of politics. But we are the counterweight of politics, we are the opposite of politics. We have to do the work of people, not the work of politicians.”In a statement on Friday announcing her withdrawal, Roy, who had been planning to attend a screening of her recently restored 1989 film In Which Annie Gives it Those Ones, called the comments “unconscionable” and feared they had reached “millions of people across the world”.View image in fullscreenWim Wenders takes part in the opening ceremony of the 76th Berlin film festival on Thursday.Photograph: Fabian Sommer/EPAThe Booker prize-winning Indian author said: “To hear them say that art should not be political is jaw-dropping. It is a way of shutting down a conversation about a crime against humanity even as it unfolds before us in real time – when artists, writers and film-makers should be doing everything in their power to stop it.”She added: “Although I have been profoundly disturbed by the positions taken by the German government and various German cultural institutions onPalestine, I have always received political solidarity when I have spoken to German audiences about my views on the genocide in Gaza.”Wenders is the serving president of this year’s Berlinale jury, which includes the American director-producer Reinaldo Marcus Green, the Japanese film-maker Hikari, the Nepalese director Min Bahadur Bham, the South Korean actor Bae Doona, the Indian director-producer Shivendra Singh Dungarpur, and Ewa Puszczyńska – who producedOscar-winning film The Zone of Interest, about the idyllic home life of an Auschwitz commandant and his family.The jury was questioned about the support the German government, which funds much of the festival, has shown for Israel. Puszczyńska called the question “complicted” and “a bit unfair”.“Of course, we are trying to talk to people – every single viewer – to make them think, but we cannot be responsible for what their decision would be to support Israel or the decision to support Palestine,” she said. “There are many other wars where genocide is committed and we do not talk about that.”Marwan Barghouti, ‘Palestine’s Mandela’, to publish book from prisonRead moreRoy, who was this week longlisted for the Women’s prize for non-fiction for her first memoir, Mother Mary Comes to Me, emphasised her belief that “what has happened inGaza, what continues to happen, is a genocide of the Palestinian people by the state of Israel”.She added: “It is supported and funded by the governments of the United States and Germany, as well as several other countries inEurope, which makes them complicit in the crime. If the greatest film-makers and artists of our time cannot stand up and say so, they should know that history will judge them. I am shocked and disgusted.”Reflecting on her film being slated for inclusion in the festival’s Classics section, the author said there had been “something sweet and wonderful” about In Which Annie Gives It Those One, describing it as “a whimsical film that I wrote 38 years ago”.Explore more on these topicsBerlin film festivalArundhati RoyWim WendersGazaPalestineEuropeIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

At first he appeared to suggest that he wanted to intervene – telling people protesting against the country’s regime that “help is coming”. But at the time the US had few military assets available.That changed with the arrival of the Lincoln carrier strike group, but by then the Iranian regime had largely regained control of the streets by killing thousands of people – possibly tens of thousands – in the most brutal crackdown in the country’s recent history.Meanwhile, the US president’s focus appeared to have moved to curbing Iran’s nuclear programme – already set back in a summer bombing campaign by Israeli and US air forces during last summer’s 12-day war.The Ford carrier strike group had been sent from the eastern Mediterranean at the end of October, and arrived in the Caribbean Sea in mid-November as Trump increased pressure on Venezeula’s former president Nicolás Maduro.It played a central role in the extraordinary seizure of Maduro by US forces in early January, and had remained in the Caribbean. However, sending the carrier and its allied warships back to the Middle East makes for an unusually long deployment: it left the US in June 2025 and has no obvious date of return.On Thursday Trump warned Iran that failure to reach a deal with his administration would be “very traumatic” and said he hoped that talks would conclude shortly.“I guess over the next month, something like that,” Trump said in response to a question about his timeline for striking a deal with Iran on its nuclear programme. “It should happen quickly. They should agree very quickly.”Then, on Friday, on a visit to the Fort Bragg military base in North Carolina, Trump said a change of government in Iran would be the “best thing that could happen”.“For 47 years, they’ve been talking and talking and talking. In the meantime, we’ve lost a lot of lives while they talk,” he told reporters.Explore more on these topicsIranDonald TrumpUS militaryUS foreign policyIran nuclear programmeMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

If we do not, we are not going to implement the second phase of the ceasefire but the second phase of the war,” he said.Mladenov said he was not willing to engage with allegations of an Israeli genocide, and said his focus was to improve humanitarian aid, decommission weapons from all factions, and end the division of Gaza itself in which part is run byIsraeland part by Palestinians.“If we do not address the issue ofHamasand Gaza itself divided into two parts, please tell me how we get to a two-state solution, because I do not see the pathway,” he said. ”We are setting ourselves up for complete and utter failure, and the price will be paid by both Israelis and Palestinians down the line.”He warned aid, emergency recovery on the ground and security were needed immediately, adding: “None of this can be materialised until Gaza is one, and it is not yet one. For Gaza to be reconstructed we need to have the technocratic committee in Gaza and effectively governing, weapons decommissioned and Israeli withdrawal.”In testy exchanges with Kallas, Mike Waltz, the US ambassador to the UN, attacked what he said was “hand-wringing” about the Board of Peace – and said the status quo of endless war, with Hamas in charge of Gaza, had to be broken.He confirmed thatIndonesia had agreed to contribute 8,000 troops to the International Stabilisation Force, and said more troop deployments were due to be announced in the coming week. He claimed that some countries were not comfortable putting billions of dollars for reconstruction through the UN system.View image in fullscreenMike Waltz, US ambassador to the UN, argues it is necessary to ‘put the UN on a diet’.Photograph: Martial Trezzini/EPADescribing Trump’s politics as “focused multilateralism”, he said it had been necessary to “put the UN on a diet and make it go back to basics of peacemaking”.Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian activist, said he feared the discussions of plans for Gaza were losing any air of reality since “the whole of the West Bank has been made open for settlementsand Israel is putting the final nail in the coffin of the Oslo accord. It is not just about accountability for genocide, but who is going to stop this process of killing the two-state solution.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineUnited NationsIsraelHamasnewsShareReuse this content"

The foreigners’ annexe was separate from the part of the camp that contained about 20,000 Syrians and Iraqis.All of those held in the camp are arbitrarily detained as they have not been tried or charged for their alleged involvement in IS, and many of the residents are young children.View image in fullscreenWomen and children inside al-Hawl camp last month. Many are now said to have fled.Photograph: Abdulmonam Eassa/Getty ImagesOn Friday, humanitarian groups said the foreigners’ annexe had been emptied almost entirely of its former residents and that most of the families left for Idlib. They said foreign women and children had been gradually leaving the foreigners’ annexe since the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF)abandoned the facilityto the advancing Syrian government forces on 20 January.“All of the foreign women have escaped in this period,” said Jihan Hanan, who directed the al-Hawl camp until its takeover by Damascus last month. “Every day, cars would come and take them at night and take them to Idlib. It wasn’t done in an organised way.”The escape of IS-linked individuals from al-Hawl and other detention facilities was a long-running concern for the international community, which warned that a mass-exodus could help IS reconstitute itself across Syria and Iraq. The US military had transferred about 3,000 IS detainees to prisons in Iraq over the past month and was expected to finish the transfer of about 4,000 more over the coming days, which could facilitate the exit of US military forces from Syria.View image in fullscreenAn NGO said women and children had been released ‘in a highly chaotic context’.Photograph: Abdulmonam Eassa/Getty ImagesIt was unclear how exactly the families left al-Hawl, whether they were let out or they escaped. A camp resident of central Asian descent told the Guardian that she was able to escape by “crawling through the fence” and that she was now in Idlib.An NGO worker said they were aware of at least one case where a woman who escaped the camp crossed into Turkey and suggested others may have done the same, but cautioned that the lack of oversight made it impossible to know where residents ended up.The Syrian government has been approached for comment. It has previously blamed escapes on the SDF, which it said abandoned the facility without coordinating with Damascus.Beatrice Eriksson, a spokesperson for the rights organisation Repatriate the Children, said: “The past two weeks, children and mothers have been moved or released in a highly chaotic context, without clarity on who is responsible or what protection measures are in place.”During two visits to the camp in the week after its handover to Syrian government forces, the Guardian saw cut fences and frequent escape attempts by residents of the foreigners’ annexe. Fighters of central Asian descent were taking women from the annexe into their cars, with their destination unknown, while others clamoured at the outer walls of the camps, arguing with guards to let their relatives out.‘Open the gates’: riots, fires and escape attempts as Syrian army takes over IS campRead moreOf the dozen or so women the Guardian spoke to in the camp, almost all expressed their desire to be released to Idlib, where they said relatives were waiting for them. Security guards and fighters expressed sympathy for the detainees, saying their continued detention was an injustice.Outside the camp’s gates, security officers from the interior ministry guarded the gates. Some took off running as their walkie-talkies squawked: “They escaped, they escaped!” Their supervising officer laughed as the men ran, joking that if it were up to him, he would just open the gates.It was unclear where the families who left the camp would go next. Some women told humanitarian workers they believed they would be repatriated – something that would require the consent of the home government.Eriksson said the disorganised nature of the release left women and children vulnerable to trafficking or recruitment to violent extremist groups and urged states to intervene to repatriate their citizens.She added: “Ending arbitrary detention is necessary, but the immediate priority must be to identify and protect these children and families, and to move them through safe, dignified processes involving international cooperation – not to leave them to navigate a conflict zone on their own.”View image in fullscreenAl-Hawl formerly held about 6,000 women and children, with a separate area for about 20,000 Syrians and Iraqis.Photograph: Abdulmonam Eassa/Getty ImagesMany states have refused to take back their nationals, despite the pleas of Kurdish forces who guarded the camp and humanitarian groups who said detention conditions were substandard and unlawful.“We’ve lost everything, all those years that we’ve been working on this issue,” said Hanan. She shared a video of a camp resident standing in her ransacked office, with the man vowing to find and kill her, referring to her by name and calling her a “pig”.“I know this man. I tried to get him released from the camp, but the security agencies said he was a risk. Now that he’s out, I and all the humanitarian workers are in danger,” Hanan said.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricaIslamic StatenewsShareReuse this content"

Drahi already owns a cable television company and a news channel in Israel that generally runs far less critical coverage of Netanyahu.The rest of Drahi’s business empire is heavily in debt and he is embroiled in a legal battle with his creditors in the US.The Union of Journalists in Israel issued a statement calling the sale an “unlawful deal, which is likely to further erode press freedom in the country” and described it as part of the Netanyahu government’s “master plan to capture the media” before this year’s scheduled elections.“The Union of Journalists is confident that Sir Blavatnik, who is known for his generous philanthropy, will not support any move that will undermine press freedom in Israel,” the statement said.Blavatnik is selling just under a 15% stake in Channel 13, the maximum share allowed to be sold to a competitor with an existing media asset under Israel’s competition laws, but critics argue that as the sole investor in the channel (Blavatnik is reportedly unwilling to invest further after years of heavy losses), Drahi will have real control of the outlet.“While Patrick Drahi is only buying 15%, our fear is that by buying 15%, he gets 100% hold of the policy of the channel,” said Anat Saragusti, who oversees freedom of the press for the Union of Journalists. “Because if he’s the only one that can pour money into the channel and make it sustainable, then it is completely dependent on him.”View image in fullscreenLeonard Blavatnik (pictured) is selling a 15% share in Channel 13, which has run critical news coverage of Benjamin Netanyahu’s government in recent years.Photograph: Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images for Warner Music Group“It’s a lose-lose for the Israeli public, in terms of freedom of speech and diversity of opinions,” Saragusti added.Drahi’s company, Altice, Netanyahu’s office and Israel’s ministry of communications were all approached for comment but did not respond.Ayala Panievsky, a presidential fellow in journalism at City St George’s, University of London, compared the struggle over Channel 13 to the fate of the Washington Post under the US billionaire Jeff Bezos, who steered it closer to Donald Trump and last weekaxed nearly a thirdof its workforce, firing hundreds of journalists.Panievsky last year published a book,The New Censorship: How the War on the Media is Taking Us Down, on the siege on the free press mounted by the populist right around the world. She views the Washington Post and Channel 13 cases as “part of the escalating war on independent and critical journalism, launched by the alliance of populist authoritarians and the broligarchy’s enablers”.She said: “Media owners should be facing heat because they are in influential positions and are collaborating with governments to harm press freedom.”Israeli journalists fear a Drahi takeover would lead to similar mass job losses as those suffered by their Washington Post colleagues.A consortium of liberal Israeli tech entrepreneurs had made a rival bid for 74% of Channel 13. A source close to the group said it was prepared to invest considerably more – $80m to $120m (£59m to £88m) over three years – in the modernisation of the channel than Drahi and had put the offer on paper, though the negotiations had not been finalised.A spokesperson for Blavatnik’s main company, Access Industries, denied there had been any political pressure to sell to Drahi. “Any suggestion that the preferred offer has been selected for political reasons is entirely false,” the spokesperson said. “Following negotiations with two separate groups, Patrick Drahi’s proposal was selected because it represented the better deal for [Channel] 13.”The spokesperson added: “His offer enables the urgent injection of funds into the channel to support [Channel] 13’s stability, expand its reach, and allow its investment in high-quality content, innovation, and digital transformation, so it can continue delivering value to its audiences. Of the two proposals, it was the higher confirmed sum, and ultimately the stronger, faster option prevailed.”The company denied Israeli reports that the Netanyahu government had signalled to Blavatnik that a purchase of the channel by the liberal tech consortium would not gain official approval. “Sir Leonard Blavatnik, nor anyone on behalf of Access, has spoken with any government official regarding [Channel] 13,” the spokesperson said.Netanyahu and his ministers have mounted a concerted campaign to reshape Israel’s media landscape before this year’s elections. One set of corruption charges the prime minister is now on trial for involves the alleged offer of favourable financial treatment in return for positive coverage.Last month a government minister sued an investigative journalist on the only other major independent news channel, Channel 12, for record damages of 12m shekels (£2.86m).The government has imposed financial sanctions on the independent newspaper Haaretz, which it accuses of “support for the enemy” over its criticism of the Gaza war.The tech consortium is expected to continue to argue its case for buying Channel 13, and the Union of Journalists said it expected Israel’s antitrust authorities or its supreme court to block the Drahi bid. Meanwhile, the reporters are hoping Blavatnik changes his mind.“If Channel 13 falls, this would be the end of the free press in Israel, because the rest will fall after that. It’s the tipping point,” Saragusti said. “I think Blavatnik doesn’t really understand that this is not merely an economic issue but a milestone in Israeli democracy.”Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

On that measure, Tony Blair’s latest report fails on almost every point.How ‘out of touch’ Tony Blair became a serious threat to climate actionRead moreThe Tony Blair Institute for Global Change (TBI)received money from the Saudi government, hasadvised the United Arab Emiratespetrostate, and counts as amain donor Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle, friend of Trump and advocate of AI.The latest TBI report calls for an expansion of oil and gas production in the North Sea, despite the additional greenhouse gas emissions this would generate, and abandoning the UK government’s target to largelydecarbonise the electricity sectorby 2030, arguing that doing so is necessary to power AI datacentres.The report claims renewable energy is too expensive. Yet this overlooks the fact that it is significantly cheaper than building the gas-fired power stations that would be needed instead.New onshore wind has been agreed at a price of £72/MWh and new solar at £65MWh – both less than half the £147/MWh cost of building and operating new gas power stations.New offshore wind, at £91/MWh, is about 40% cheaper than new gas.According to the analyst firm AuroraEnergyResearch, offshore wind priced below £94/MWh lowers consumer bills. By contrast, nuclear power – on which the TBI is keen – is likely to cost more than £133/MWh and would take many more years to build.The report also cavils at the cost of electricity grid upgrades needed to support renewable energy, without acknowledging that grid improvements will be required in any scenario. It also ignores theconclusion of the network system operators, NESO, that a clean power system for the UK by 2030 is achievable “without increasing costs to consumers”.2:17What does net zero emissions actually mean? And is it different to the Paris agreement? – videoDraining the last drops of oil and gas from the North Sea lies at the heart of the TBI advice, projecting a £165bn industry as a result. Yet the North Sea is a rapidly declining basin where the remaining reserves are increasingly expensive to extract. Accordingly, says the TBI, oil and gas companies should receive substantial tax cuts.Since 2020, the energy industry has made £125bn in profits in the UK, with oil and gas companies enjoying windfalls while vulnerable people struggled to heat their homes. Shell made $40bn in 2022 alone, BP $30bn the same year. Although profits have come down from their peaks, persistently high gas prices are keeping fossil fuel companies buoyant.Simon Francis, a coordinator at theEnd Fuel Poverty Coalition, said: “To call for thewindfall taxto be scrapped, while energy giants post extraordinary profits and millions live in cold damp homes is staggering.“That tax exists because companies benefited from a crisis that devastated household finances. Removing the windfall tax would reward profiteering and shift the burden back on to households that are still paying the price of Britain’s overreliance on gas.”View image in fullscreenTony Blair (left) during a prime ministerial visit to the Buzzard oilfield in the North Sea, off the coast of Aberdeen, in March 2007.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PANumerous analyses have shown that further North Sea production would make little difference to the UK’s energy security and would not reduce energy bills.Bob Ward, a policy director of the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said: “More North Sea production would have no significant impact on the wholesale price of electricity and would not reduce prices for British households and businesses.”Gas is traded on international markets, which determine the price. Even if the North Sea were drilled to exhaustion, the UK is likely to be reliant on imports for at least two-thirds of its gas within five years, and potentially all of it by 2050.Mike Childs, the head of science at Friends of the Earth, said: “If we’re to bring down bills for good and protect people from future gas price volatility, then we must accelerate the development of renewable energy.”The report’s claim that renewable energy will be costly – despite price falls of 50-90% in recent years – also overlooks the fact thatwind energy cut wholesale prices of electricity by about a thirdlast year, with further reductions likely as new offshore windfarms come online.View image in fullscreenThe TBI report calls for an expansion of oil and gas production in the North Sea.Photograph: Kendall/AlamyShaun Spiers, the executive director of the Green Alliance thinktank, said: “We don’t need to rethink a clean power plan that’s working – the UK generated record-breaking amounts of renewable energy last year.”Consumers have yet to feel the full benefit, largely because the structure of the UK’s privatised energy market means electricity prices remainmostly dependent on the price of gas. The TBI report, Spiers added, “gives few suggestions for how to do this”.Although TBI maintains that the UK’s target of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 should remain, it does not explain how slowing the rollout of renewables is compatible with that goal.What matters to the climate is not emissions in 2050 but the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Maintaining fossil fuel production, as TBI advocates, might still allow net zero to be reached by mid-century, butwould result in higher emissionsin the interim, undermining the purpose of the target.View image in fullscreenClimate activists in Edinburgh at a rally against the Rosebank oil and gas field in November 2024.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianAccording to Angharad Hopkinson, a political campaigner for Greenpeace UK: “The assertion that abandoning strategies to reduce emissions will somehow reduce emissions, and choosing more expensive energy will somehow reduce costs, is ludicrous.”Elsewhere in the report, the TBI rehashes the argument that the UK is responsible for just 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions, implying that the actions of larger emitters such as China will make more of an impact.While technically accurate, this fails to acknowledge that roughly a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions come from countries that each account for about 1% of emissions. If all of them abandoned net zero efforts, global temperatures would rise far beyond the 1.5C limit of safe heating.Explore more on these topicsOil and gas companiesThinktanksOilGas (Business)Fossil fuelsEnergy industryEnergyanalysisShareReuse this content"

This result is a mandate to end fear, curb corruption and move beyond the climate of intimidation people have lived with for years.”Khan acknowledged a difficult task lay ahead for the new BNP government, which has promised a new era of democracy and zero tolerance towards corruption. “We know the hard work begins now: rebuilding institutions, creating opportunities for young people and proving, every single day, that this government is accountable to its citizens,” he said.View image in fullscreenTarique Rahman greets supporters as he leaves his residence in Dhaka on Friday.Photograph: Drik/Getty ImagesIndia was among the first countries to congratulate the BNP. Relations between the two neighbours had plummeted since the fall of Hasina and the message from the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, congratulating the BNP on its “decisive” win was seen as extending an olive branch to the new government.“India will continue to stand in support of a democratic, progressive and inclusiveBangladesh,” said Modi, adding that he was looking forward to working with Rahman.The US and Pakistan also congratulated the BNP on the election victory.Tarique Rahman promises era of clean politics as Bangladesh holds first election since fall of HasinaRead moreRahman, who returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years of exile in London, is poised to become the country’s next prime minister. He comes from one of Bangladesh’s most powerful political dynasties; the son of the former prime minister Khaleda Zia and the former president Ziaur Rahman, who was assassinated in 1981.Shafiqur Rahman, the head of Jamaat-e-Islami, conceded defeat. He said Jamaat would not engage in the “politics of opposition” for the sake of it. “We will do positive politics,” he told reporters.In a statement on Friday morning, Jamaat-e-Islami alleged some irregularities in vote counting in constituencies where their candidates suffered narrow losses, which it said “raises serious questions about the integrity of the results process”.Jamaat-e-Islami’s campaign had attracted controversy, particularly among female voters,over regressive commentsmade by Shafiqur Rahman on women’s rights and employment. Nonetheless Jamaat-e-Islami’s 68 seats represent a historic showing for a party that had previously never won more than 12% of the vote. Together with seats won by allied parties, it will probably be a formidable opposition to the BNP.View image in fullscreenShafiqur Rahman of Jamaat-e-Islami at a press conference in Dhaka on Thursday.Photograph: Mohammad Ponir Hossain/ReutersThe election was the first truly competitive vote in the country in years. As documented by human rights groups and the UN, Hasina’s regimeroutinely suppressed dissentof its critics and political opponents, thousands of whom were disappeared, tortured and killed in secret jails. Many emerged only after Hasina was toppled. The past three elections under Hasina were marred by widespread allegations of vote-rigging.Following the bloody uprising that led to her downfall, many viewed the election as a crucial test of Bangladesh’s ability to restore trust in democracy and transition from public protest into tangible political reform and stability. Hasina’s Awami League partywas barred from contestingand its supporters said they would boycott the vote.“More than anything, I’m hoping this BNP government remembers why people risked their lives to vote – we wanted an end to fear, not just a change of faces,” said Sadia Chowdhury, 25, a master’s student at Jahangirnagar University. “If they can give us jobs based on merit, reign in political violence and prove that the law applies to everyone, then maybe we’ll finally feel this country belongs to us again.”The largely peaceful nature of polling day was seen as a huge step forward for the country. Across the capital, police officers kept watch on horses wearing blankets that bore the message: “Police are here, vote without fear.” Voters at polling stations in the capital, Dhaka, expressed their jubilation at being able to cast their vote freely and without fear for the first time in years.“Last time I voted was in 2008,” said Mohammad Shah Hossain, 46, who said he was supporting the BNP. “After that it got very difficult to come out and vote. Every time I went to the polling station, somebody had already cast my ballot.”According to the election commission, preliminary figures showed nationwide voter turnout at 59.4%, exceeding the 42% seen in the last elections. This was also the first election that had given the overseas diaspora an opportunity to vote. Postal votes, which also included officials in the country who could not return home to cast their ballot, had an 80.11% participation rate.The student-led uprising that toppled Hasina’s 15-year regime in August 2024 had been prompted by mounting anger over widespread corruption, human rights abuses and an economic slump. The uprising, and Hasina’s brutal crackdown on anti-government protesters, left an estimated 1,400 people dead, according to the UN.View image in fullscreenPeople read newspapers at Kamalapur railway station in Dhaka on Friday.Photograph: Monirul Alam/EPAFor the past 18 months, the country has been run by an interim government under Bangladesh’s only Nobel laureate, Muhammad Yunus, who was tasked with readying the country for free and fair elections. Speaking after casting his vote in Dhaka, Yunus said the country had “ended the nightmare and begun a new dream”.The newly elected government faces an uphill task of restoring democracy, law and order and economic growth. To some, the return of the BNP – a dynastic party whose previous regime was riddled with rampant corruption – did not represent the spirit of reform and hunger for change that had driven the student-led uprising against Hasina.Shafqat Munir, a fellow at the Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies, said the election result offered a “new beginning for Bangladesh”. “One of the fundamental tasks before the new government would be to reset and recover the economy and, concurrently, ensure stability and law and order,” said Munir.“There are many unfulfilled aspirations from the monsoon revolution of 2024 which need to be implemented. This is a great opportunity for Bangladesh. This is also a country which requires a significant amount of healing. So reconciliation will also be a very important part of the agenda.”Alongside the election, a referendum was held on a set of constitutional reforms championed by Yunus, known as the July Charter, which is designed to prevent any autocratic regimes taking power in the future by strengthening judicial independence and introducing a two-term limit for the prime minister. Early results suggested it had passed with more 68% voting yes.As the election unfolded, Hasina remained in exile in India after a war crimes tribunalsentenced her to deathfor crimes against humanitycommitted during the final throesof her regime. Her escape, and the refusal by India to send her back, has been a key issue in the frayed ties between Dhaka and New Delhi. In a statement sent after polling stations closed, Hasina denounced the election as a “carefully planned farce” and called for the results to be cancelled.Redwan Ahmed contributed reporting from DhakaExplore more on these topicsBangladeshSheikh HasinaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Now, for the first time, all 400 of them in the brothel village have their own birth certificates.That milestone was reached after a push by campaigners who have spent decades working with Bangladesh’s undocumented children born in brothels or on the street. It means they can finally access the rights afforded to other citizens: the ability to go to school, to be issued a passport or to vote.The denial of a birth certificate and the precarious life that followed was because officials had always demanded the name and documentation of the father, despite them being unknown.“They didn’t have the rights of a citizen previously – they were treated as alien in society,” said Khaleda Akhter, Bangladesh programme manager for the London-based anti-slavery organisation Freedom Fund. She added that the reform “gives them their fundamental rights, it makes them feel safer, it gives them hope”.View image in fullscreenA birth certificate also allows children to apply for a passport and eventually vote.Photograph: Bengal Picture Library/AlamyMore than 700 unrecognised children have now been registered in Daulatdia and brothels elsewhere thanks to a push by Freedom Fund and local organisations that discovered an overlooked stipulation in the law: since 2018, it has been permitted for a birth to be registered even if there was no information on the parents.“It was only two or three lines and is not explained in the act properly, so it was not used because generally our government officials focus on the general application of procedures,” she said. “When I first came to know about it, we massively disseminated this information with our partners.”Teaming up with civil society groups, they set about finding all the children born in the brothels, collecting their information and submitting it to the government, while also lobbying local authority offices about the importance of this previously ignored clause in the law.The campaign has been so successful that little advocacy is required – mothers have been enthusiastically encouraging other women to get their babies registered, knowing that the lack of a birth certificate could prove a lifelong impediment to their children, starting from any attempt to go to school.View image in fullscreenAn estimated 1,300 to 2,000 sex workers, with about 400 children, live in Daulatdia, which is situated near one of Bangladesh’s busiest ferry ports.Photograph: Bengal Picture Library/AlamySabbir Hossain, who co-wrotea study on the Banishanta brothelin south-west Bangladesh, said parents once had to find alternative ways to get their children into education. Some would send their children to religious schools, the unregulatedmadrasas, or would ask men they knew to identify themselves as the fathers.Lacking a birth certificate not only denies children opportunities, it can also make them vulnerable to trafficking, Akhter said.For two decades, she has helped save girls from enforced sex work in Bangladesh’s brothels,where many are underage. Without a birth certificate, it is harder to prove a girl is under 18.The living hell of young girls enslaved in Bangladesh's brothelsRead moreAccording to a 2024Freedom Fund survey of brothels in Dhaka, almost half of sex workers said they were forced to work in conditions they had not agreed to and that more than a fifth were under 18.“If you don’t have a birth certificate, you are invisible in the system,” said Akhter. “You are more vulnerable to abuse, trafficking and exploitation. These documents are not just a tool, it’s about survival.”Akhter said she saw just how a birth certificate could change the life of a child when she visited a 14-year-old girl who was from the fifth generation of a family living in a brothel.“When I entered, she asked me if I understood what this meant. I told her to tell me. She said this is the first time she would be able to get a stipend [to afford] to go to school,” said Akther.“She was laughing and I could see the happiness on her face. She said to me: ‘Khaleda, my identity has been recognised by the government.’ She felt that finally she had some protection against all the odds she had faced in her childhood.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentChildrenHuman rightsSex workBangladeshSouth and central AsiaSex traffickingnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a very well-loved tree and it means a lot,” Celia Steven, 85, said. “Sadly people are a bit prone to cut down trees and think about it later so I find it very disturbing.”The more than 220-year-old tree was grown from a pip planted by Mary Anne Brailsford between 1809 and 1815. Its apples were discovered nearly 50 years later by local gardener Henry Merryweather in a garden owned by Matthew Bramley. Merryweather was given permission to take cuttings from the Bramley seedling as long as the apples he sold bore Bramley’s name.Steven said her great-grandfather, Merryweather, “believed in that apple, he commercialised it, he marketed it, he promoted it … he called it the ‘King of Covent Garden’”. Since then, it has become one of Britain’s best loved cooking apples.Despite the historic nature of the tree, it has never been granted a tree preservation order, which would protect it under law and prevent it from being chopped down.It has, however, been recognised by the royal family. In 2002, the queen’s golden jubilee cited the Bramley as one of the 50 “great British trees” and two decades later it was recognised as part of a selection of 70 ancient trees dedicated to the queen for the platinum jubilee.Steven said: “Our ancient trees are not protected in the way they should be. They’re not revered in the way they should be. They’re very special to this country and when we have got such things we do need to look after them and protect them for the future.”Dan Llywelyn Hall, the founder of the Mother Bramley legacy fund, said such heritage trees should never be at risk like this. The 45-year-old artist, who is hoping to fundraise £400,000 with the Merryweather family to buy the site, said the tree had been “in a state of neglect” since the university bought the cottages.Despite this, and the fact the Bramley was diagnosed with an incurable honey fungus, it is still alive and producing apples, he said.View image in fullscreenThe Bramley is ‘a million-in-one apple highly regarded in the culinary world’, said Dan Llywelyn- Hall, the founder of the Mother Bramley legacy fund.Photograph: Paul Maguire/Alamy“It can’t be understated, it’s the most important, most famous apple tree in the world.

The fact we have the original still alive is quite an extraordinary thing,” he said.“It brings a bigger national discussion up here as to why we are terrible in this country at looking after our heritage trees,” he said.‘It’s appalling’: original bramley apple tree being neglected, say campaignersRead moreA Nottingham Trent University spokesperson said: “NTU is proud to have been the latest custodian of the Bramley apple tree and to have played a part in helping to safeguard and celebrate its legacy.“When the university became custodian it was well known that the tree had outlived its natural lifespan by quite some time. We have worked hard using our academic expertise to maintain it in the most careful and appropriate way for a tree of this age and condition and been delighted to provide access to members of the public and for annual events such as the Bramley apple festival and Heritage Open Days. Without the dedication and hard work of our colleagues, we believe it would have deteriorated significantly further.“We were visited by an independent tree specialist last year who paid tribute to the work we have done to both maintain and celebrate it. We also reached out individually to people in Southwell with a special connection to the tree before the cottages were listed for sale and, again, people expressed support for the work we have undertaken.“The university aims to ensure that the tree will remain in the care of a responsible custodian. We will also continue to provide expert guidance and support to them on how to care for the tree.”Explore more on these topicsNottinghamFruitFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

She said: “We were banned because Palestine Action’s disruption of Israel’s largest weapons manufacturer, Elbit Systems, cost the corporation millions of pounds in profits and to lose out on multibillion-pound contracts.“We’ve used the same tactics as direct action organisations throughout history, including anti-war groups Keir Starmer defended in court, and the government acknowledged in these legal proceedings that this ban was based on property damage, not violence against people.“Banning Palestine Action was always about appeasing pro-Israel lobby groups and weapons manufacturers, and nothing to do with terrorism … Today’s landmark ruling is a victory for freedom for all, and I urge the government to respect the court’s decision and bring this injustice to an end without further delay.”The judgment is the first time that an organisation banned under anti-terrorism law has successfully challenged proscription in court.The judges allowed the challenge on two of four grounds. They were that there was “a very significant interference” with the rights to freedom of speech and freedom of assembly and that Cooper’s decision to proscribe Palestine Action was not consistent with her own policy, which required her to take into account factors including the nature and scale of the organisation’s activities, and the specific threat that it posed to the UK.Sharp described Palestine Action as an organisation “that promotes its political cause through criminality and encouragement of criminality”, but added: “The court considered that the proscription of Palestine Action was disproportionate. A very small number of Palestine Action’s activities amounted to acts of terrorism within the definition of section 1 of the 2000 [Terrorism] Act.“For these, and for Palestine Action’s other criminal activities, the general criminal law remains available. The nature and scale of Palestine Action’s activities falling within the definition of terrorism had not yet reached the level, scale and persistence to warrant proscription.”About 100 people ​who had gathered outside the ​high ​court building in central London cheered and chanted “free Palestine” when they heard the decision.View image in fullscreenProtesters outside the Royal Courts of Justice following the verdict.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAThe UN special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, Ben Saul, Amnesty International UK and Liberty, who all intervened in the case, called for Mahmood to respect the court’s decision.Saul said accepting the judgment “will enable the relevant authorities to take no further action against those who legitimately expressed their beliefs about Israel and Palestine since 5 July 2025 and were caught up in the policing of the unlawful ban; and also, to apologise to those affected for stigmatising them as terrorists”.The Green party leader, Zack Polanski, said: “It is time for the government to stop criminalising the people protesting a genocide.”The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson, Max Wilkinson, said: “Placing Palestine Action in the same legal category as Isis was disproportionate.”However, the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, supported the government’s decision to appeal because “there can be no hesitation when public safety and national security are at stake”.The Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council also threw their support behind an appeal, saying they were “deeply concerned” by the ruling. “Palestine Action has repeatedly targeted buildings hosting Jewish communal institutions, Jewish-owned businesses, or sites associated with Israel, in ways that cause fear and disruption far beyond the immediate protest sites,” the groups said.Palestine Action has always maintained that it targeted companies complicit with Elbit Systems, or otherwise with the oppression of Palestinians, regardless of the owners’ identity.Those arrested since proscription – most of them for holding placards saying “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action” – are accused of offences under section 13 of the Terrorism Act, which carries a maximum sentence of six months in prison. More than 500 of those arrested, who include vicars, pensioners and military veterans, have been charged.Showing support for or being a member of a proscribed group is a crime, with offences under section 12 of the act carrying a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.Mahmood said on Friday: “I amdisappointed by the court’s decision and disagree with the notion that banning this terrorist organisation is disproportionate. The proscription of Palestine Action followed a rigorous and evidence-based decision-making process, endorsed by parliament. The proscription does not prevent peaceful protest in support of the Palestinian cause, another point on which the court agrees.“As a former lord chancellor, I have the deepest respect for our judiciary. Home secretaries must, however, retain the ability to take action to protect our national security and keep the public safe. I intend to fight this judgment in the court of appeal.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

This meant that claims of serious physical and sexual assault made by the mother against the father were not examined.In December 2019 the court ordered the children’s removal from their mother and granted the father sole custody. They were nine and 12 at the time. Erin did not see or speak to them again until last year.But last month England’s most senior family judge “set aside” the court’s original findings based on the conclusions of Gill, who claims to have acted as an expert witness in up to 200 cases.It is the second time in six months that findings in a case in which she has given evidence have been dismissed by the high court.At the 29 January hearing, it was heard how the ruling had left Erin feeling as if she had “a noose around her neck for six years”. In an interviewwith the Bureau of Investigative Journalismshe said: “It wasn’t just me. The children were cut off from all their family and friends. They had 50% of their identity stripped away overnight.”It was argued that the children had been silenced by the process set in motion by Gill’s evidence, even when they raised allegations of abuse.Lawyers told the high court that errors and missed opportunities by every professional involved in the case had failed to protect the siblings.A previous attempt by the mother to appeal was blocked and she launched a fresh application seven months ago.The case took a dramatic turn in November when her teenage son Dylan* ran away from his father’s home and hired his own solicitor. After a period in foster care he was laterreunited with his motherfor their first Christmas together in six years.Unusually, the teenager – represented by his own legal team – was in court for his mother’s legal bid overseen by the president of the family division, Sir Andrew McFarlane.The 15-year-old sat at the front of the courtroom as Jo Delahunty KC told McFarlane how her young client had lost all trust in professionals and become lonely, fearful and isolated in his father’s care.McFarlane made a new order for the boy to live with his mother. He is yet to hand down his judgment, which is expected to map out a route for similarly affected families who wish to return their case to court.McFarlane said: “Melanie Gill considers this some kind of vendetta against her. This is far bigger than one person. It’s about the court properly engaging with allegations and cross-allegations.”After the hearing, Dylan said that he felt heard at last, adding: “I’m so grateful to be home with my mum finally and to feel happy again”.The children’s father, who has consistently denied the allegations against him, chose not to attend the January hearing. The daughter, who is now 18, was not party to the case.Erin’s legal team cited “compelling” new information in bringing the successful challenge. This includedguidancefrom December 2024, which said the courts should not use experts to look for“parental alienation”– the idea that a child has rejected one parent because they have been manipulated by the other.The guidance also stated that psychologists assessing families on behalf of the courts should be regulated. However, judges are permitted to appoint whom they wish, including experts who are not regulated.Gill asserts that she is well qualified to perform the role of expert witness in family proceedings and that she has years of specialist training and expertise.The government is working with the committee that makes rules for the family courts to introduce a ban on unregulated experts, after a public consultation last year, which received 60 submissions.*Names have been changed to protect the identities of those involvedExplore more on these topicsFamily lawChild protectionnewsShareReuse this content"

Two other tracks from Debí Tirar Más Fotos are in this week’s Top 20, with Nuevayol at No 15 and Baile Inolvidable at No 20. In the UK, where non-English language hits are rare, an artist having three Spanish-language songs in the Top 20 at once is likely to be unprecedented.Bad Bunny’s half-time show was a global sensation:accordingto NFL and Ripple Analytics, its 128.2 million viewers made it the fourth most watched Super Bowl half-time show in US television history (behind Kendrick Lamar’s show last year, Michael Jackson in 1993 and Usher in 2024), while more than half of views on social media came from outside the US.Rightwingers had criticised the booking, and after the show Donald Trump called it “absolutely terrible, one of the worst … a slap in the face to our country”. But there was anoutpouringof admiration elsewhere, from political figures such as Gavin Newsom and Meghan McCain toa five-star Guardian reviewby Stefanie Fernández, who wrote that Bad Bunny “reminded so many of us of the love, the community and the absolute joy that we create together every day in spite of everything else”.Elsewhere in the charts, Taylor Swift jumps 14 places to No 1 with her single Opalite, boosted by the launch ofits music videostarring Graham Norton and the guests from his talkshow on the week Swift appeared, who included Domhnall Gleeson and Lewis Capaldi.Olivia Dean’s The Art of Loving is at No 1 in the album chart for the seventh non-consecutive week, having not left the Top 5 since its release in September. J Cole is the highest new entry at No 3 with what is billed as his final album,The Fall Off.The Official Charts Company has launched a new classical album chart this week, featuring the albums “released in the past 12 months that are making an impact across the UK, ranked by UK sales and streams”. Topping it in its first week is 21-year-old South Korean pianist Yunchan Lim, with an album of recordings of Bach’s Goldberg Variations recorded live in Carnegie Hall.Explore more on these topicsBad BunnyUK chartsPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

The bill would impose a national photo identification requirement to vote, in addition to requiring proof of citizenship to register and drastically limiting mail-in voting.“There will be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!”Trump postedwhile onboard Air Force One on Friday afternoon after speaking to troops at Fort Bragg.Trump sends second aircraft carrier to Middle East in effort to increase pressure on IranRead more“Also, the People of our Country are insisting on Citizenship, and No Mail-In Ballots, with exceptions for Military, Disability, Illness, or Travel,” the president added, falsely, since there is no popular majority for banning vote by mail.In fact, polling conducted last yearshowed the exact opposite: 58% of Americans favor allowing any voter to cast their ballot by mail if they want to.Trump’s efforts to impose voter ID requirements are likely to face immediate legal challenges, as the US constitution leaves the conduct of elections to the states.The president, however, claimed to have “searched the depths of Legal Arguments not yet articulated or vetted on this subject, and will be presenting an irrefutable one” that would allow the federal government to take unprecedented control of elections run by the states. But ina second postduring his flight to his Palm Beach resort, he offered more hyperbole than facts, in a long diatribe punctuated with all-caps words.“We cannot let the Democrats get away with NO VOTER I.D. any longer. These are horrible, disingenuous CHEATERS,” Trump wrote.“If we can’t get it through Congress, there are Legal reasons why this SCAM is not permitted. I will be presenting them shortly, in the form of an Executive Order,” Trump added.“I hope the Supreme Court realizes, as they ‘painstakingly’ review the very simple topic of Country Saving Tariffs … that these Corrupt and Deranged Democrats, if they ever gain power, will not only be adding two States to our roster of 50, with all of the baggage thereto, but will also PACK THE COURT,” the president posted.Trump has long alleged systemic voter fraud contributed to his 2020 presidential election loss, despite no evidence to back up that claim.Trumpsignedan executive order last year requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote and blocking states from accepting mail-in ballots received after election day, even if they were postmarked before then.

I used to snort cocaine off of toilet seats.”Kennedy, who was appointed secretary of the federal health and human services (HHS) department despite his avowedanti-vaccine activism, made thatremarkon the 12 February episode of Theo Von’s podcast This Past Weekend.The president of Protect Our Care, Brad Woodhouse,issueda one-word statement on Kennedy’s comments: “Resign.”The group added that Kennedy’s comment about cocaine – which as recently as 2023 was involved in nearly 30,000 overdose deaths in a year in the US – “continues to lay bare why he is the most dangerous … person ever to lead such an important federal agency”.Kennedy on the podcast mentioned the drug in reference to his continued attendance at in-person recovery meetings during the pandemic. “Like, if I don’t, if I don’t treat it, which means for me going to meetings every day, it’s just bad for my life,” said Kennedy, who has spoken publicly about past struggles with drug addiction.The commentary marked another controversial moment for Kennedy during his first year as health secretary for the Donald Trump White House. He has also faced criticism over his handling of USmeaslesoutbreaks that have left several people dead from a disease that had been declared eliminated from the country in 2000.Amid those outbreaks, Kennedy has portrayed measles vaccination – long proven safe – as a personal choice rather than universal need, instead boosting spurious treatments.The health secretary’s new dietary guidelines have also spurred worry that his prioritizing of meat and dairy will cause health problems. Critics add that pushing for meat-heavy diets will deal a blow to theenvironment, with forests razed to make way for agricultural land.Meanwhile, public trust in Kennedy and the American healthcare system has dropped.A recent KFFpolldetermined “that a majority of the public continue to disapprove of [Kennedy’s] performance as [health] secretary and his handling of US vaccine policy”.The Democratic representative Diana DeGette of Colorado criticized Kennedy’s tenure in a post on X,saying: “Public health can’t survive another year of this.”Asked for comment, the HHS spokesperson, Andrew Nixon, said: “Under Secretary Kennedy’s leadership, HHS is exercising its full authority to deliver results for the American people.“In 2025, the department confronted longstanding public health challenges with transparency, courage, and gold-standard science … HHS will carry this momentum into 2026 to strengthen accountability, put patients first, and protect public health.”Explore more on these topicsRobert F Kennedy JrUS healthcareUS politicsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The occasion was a May 2023 deposition related to several lawsuits filed against his bank over its history of involvement with the sex traffickerJeffrey Epstein.The question put to Dimon was straightforward: “When did you first learn that Jeffrey Epstein was a customer of JPMorgan?”His answer seemed clear: “I don’t recall knowing anything about Jeffrey Epstein until the stories broke sometime in 2019” – meaning the stories about Epstein’s arrest by federal authorities in the summer of 2019 and his death a month later in a Manhattan jail cell.Clear, but believable? This exchange can be found in the US justice department’s Epstein files, with the digital “Epstein library”, as it’s called, tabulating 204 “results” (separate documents, though some duplicative) for Dimon, at current count, and 9,404 for his bank.Epstein was a client of JP Morgan Chase for 15 years, from 1998 to 2013, for the last eight of which Dimon was the bank’s CEO, the position he still holds. And Epstein was not just any client, buta prized oneof JPMorgan’s private bank for ultra-wealthy customers. A JP Morgan report, belatedly filed with the treasury department, flagged about 4,700 Epstein-related“suspicious activity”transactions totaling $1.1bn, including payments to women from post-Soviet countries. Through Dimon’s bank, Epstein wired hundreds of millions of dollars to Russian banks.Not only that, a top former JP Morgan executive,Jes Staley, undermined Dimon’s sworn testimony – claiming to have communicated with Dimon on Epstein years before the 2019 arrest. And a current senior bank executive, Mary Erdoes, often said to be on Dimon’s shortlist of candidates to succeed him as CEO, was also actively involved with the Epstein account and was aware, as documents show, of Epstein’s court-affirmed status as a high-risk sex offender.And back in 2010, two years after Epstein pleadedguiltyin Florida to soliciting sex from girls as young as 14, an aide toEpstein askedhim in an email whether snacks or a meal should be prepared “for your evening appointments” with Staley, Dimon and Lord Peter Mandelson, at that time business secretary in Britain’s Labour government. Mandelson apparently aimed to get Dimon to“mildly threaten”Britain’s then chancellor, Alistair Darling, to force a retreat on a proposed supertax on banker bonuses.It is no stretch to callJamie Dimona legend: the Voice of Wall Street and its Senior Statesman, easily the most recognized name in American and perhaps even global banking. “Jamie” – the given name is enough to garner a knowing nod in financial, political and media circles – acquired his legendhood in the 2008-2009 financial crisis, when he worked closely with Washington to stave off a total collapse of the banking system. He was the Last Man Standing, in the title of the financial journalist Duff McDonald’s laudatory biography, published in 2009. The book’s final sentence says it all: “At a time when true Wall Street leaders seem in desperately short supply, Jamie Dimon has emerged as a moral and managerial compass for both his industry and the country itself.”View image in fullscreenJamie Dimon testifies during a Senate hearing in September 2022.Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesYet even legends are flesh-and-blood people who can screw up, to use the blunt language Dimon himself is known for. It’s time, then, to reconsider this icon. One month shy of 70, Dimon is in his Last Act, no more than a few years, he says, from stepping down from his reign as CEO, now in its 21st year. But this final stretch of his career is shaping up as a bumpy one, as Dimon tries to navigate an array of acute challenges that relate more to America’s turbulent political environment – the raging anti-elite populism of both right and left – than to the demands he faces as the manager of an enormous company active in just about every corner of the financial universe. With Donald Trump himself nowdemandingthat prosecutors investigate Epstein’s ties to Dimon’s bank, Dimon’s once-sterling legacy stands at risk of being tarnished.“There’s got to be more accountability from the top on down,” the Democratic senator Ron Wyden, the powerful ranking member of the Senate finance committee, told me. “Epstein was not an anonymous customer with a few thousand bucks in his checking account, he was a high-value, high-profile client of white-glove private banks, and a known criminal. It’s simply not good enough for leaders at those banks to say they never had an inkling that something was off.”Dimon has warm personal ties with some figures in Congress. Ro Khanna, the House Democrat from California, recalled meeting with Dimon, at the banker’s office in New York, to ask for support for the city’s south Asian cab drivers – Khanna is the son of immigrants from India – in a bitter dispute with Uber. “I found him empathetic and willing to help,” Khanna told me. But when I asked the congressman, a leader of the drive to compel the justice department to release the Epstein files, whether he was inclined to believe Dimon on not being aware of Epstein until 2019, he demurred. “I will follow the evidence wherever it leads,” he said.“I think what happened to these women is atrocious, and I’m horrified at the amount of human trafficking that takes place,” Dimon said in his 2023 deposition. “And I wouldn’t mind personally apologizing to them,” he added, for whatever role his bank could have played to report Epstein’s banking activities to the authorities quicker.After poring over Dimon’s deposition, I did feel somewhat jarred on listening to Dimon, three years earlier, on the Coffee with the Greats podcast of Miles Fisher. In the deposition, asked whether he read the New York Post, for which the Epstein saga was prime tabloid fare, Dimon replied: “I don’t really read the New York Post.”But on the podcast, he said, “I read quickly the Daily News”at the start of every day and then “quickly the New York Postbecause everyone reads the New York Post”.Simply appearing in the Epstein files does not establish guilt. Individuals may be swept up by a stray reference, an email correspondence or an associate’s empty boast.But Dimon’s professed ignorance of Epstein’s activities as a JPMorgan Chase client is all the more remarkable given his reputation for vacuuming up every stray bit of information in any organization he is leading. “He will go several layers down,” his longtime friend Hans Morris, who worked alongside Dimon decades ago at the Smith Barney brokerage, told me. “He likes to know the facts. And whoever did the work does the talking.” Morris, it should be noted, was speaking in general terms, not in response to a particular question on Epstein.Meanwhile, Trump, a tireless stoker of populist flames, ever in search of retribution, is making things personal with Dimon. On 22 January,he sued Dimon, as well as JPMorgan Chase, in state court in Florida, seeking $5bn in civil damages for terminating him as a client after the riot at the US Capitol building on 6 January 2021. Trump alleges that he and family members were put on a “blacklist” as a “result of political discrimination”. That would be one grievance. Maybe, also, Trump hasn’t forgotten the time, back in 2018, in his first term, when Dimon ranted against him, incautiously declaring: “I’m as tough as he is, I’m smarter than he is.” In 2024, Dimon’s wife canvassed door-to-door for Kamala Harris.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump shakes hands Dimon in February 2017.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersThe lawsuit, which the bank says “has no merit”, follows attempts by Dimon to keep things peaceful in Trump’s second turn in office, the occasional barb notwithstanding, as in the banker’s criticism at Davos this year of the heavy-handed tactics of US Immigration and Customers Enforcement Officers.“I don’t like what I’m seeing, with five grown men beating up little women,” he said. The two have met amicably in the White House to discuss matters like interest rates. Dimon “is not trying to piss off anyone”, a source close to the bank said.The effort to reach a pragmatic understanding with as difficult a figure as Trump is vintage Dimon. He is, at bottom, an accommodator, his remarkable run a testament to the principle that the race is not to the swift but to the adaptable. “If I was the government, I’d close it down,” he said of cryptocurrencies in 2023. But in a partnership between his bank and Coinbase announced last year, Chase credit card holders will be able to use their cards to buy on Coinbase not only bitcoin but also even nonsense meme tokens like Dogecoin – and they also will be able to redeem their Chase Ultimate Reward points for the USDC stablecoin.Throughout his career, Dimon has shown a remarkable ability for “threading the needle” between his personal feelings on a matter and the needs of his bank’s customers, Mike Mayo, the veteran banking industry analyst, now at Wells Fargo Securities, told me. “Jamie Dimon can be a bully,” Mayo said, noting an incident when Dimon berated him for, in Dimon’s mind, a bad call on a stock. But he also said that Dimon will sometimes call him, out of the blue, to patch things up. In any event, as not only the CEO of the bank but also the longtime chairman of its board, Dimon does things his own way at the bank, Mayo said, unquestioned by the other directors. “No one is keeping tabs on Jamie Dimon,” the analyst told me.In the end, Dimon may be judged by the “last act” of his Last Act – the handoff to a successor. Because JPMorgan Chase has become synonymous with his name and leadership, this won’t be an easy feat, no matter whom he chooses. “I don’t think it’s the case that JPMorgan Chase is going to do well after Jamie Dimon,” Simon Johnson, the Nobel prize-winning MIT economist and sharp critic of banking concentration in the US, told me.View image in fullscreenJamie Dimon sitting in a tall building, undated.Photograph: Michael L Abramson/Getty ImagesA caricaturist’s drawing would highlight the nose and the ears, both of which are prominent. There’s that gravelly voice in which his upbringing in New York City’s borough of Queens can be detected, and his penchant for speaking in short, punchy sentences, sometimes with profanity (all of which, including the Queens part, can also be said of Trump). Never mind about bankers’ pinstripes: he’s often seen without a tie and in denim. “He is very approachable,” Thomas Hoenig, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and a former vice-chair of the FDIC, told me.For my own efforts to gain face time with Dimon, I began with a congenial 30-minute phone call with Joe Evangelisti, the bank’s head of media relations and a diligent guardian of access to his longtime boss. We exchanged the names of our respective dogs and agreed to try to meet in New York. So we did, several months later, at his office, after I sent Dimon, care of Evangelista, an eight-page list of questions, including Epstein-related ones. Knowing of Dimon’s fondness for reading history, I handed Evangelista a copy of my 2017 book, Madness Rules the Hour,on 1860 America on the verge of civil war. “Madness yesterday – and today?” I wrote in my inscription. Evangelista promised to give the book to his boss, but I never got the chance to interview Dimon.Evangelista did, however, answer on the record some of my questions addressed to Dimon. As for Epstein: “We wish we never worked with him and we didn’t help him commit his heinous crimes,” he said. As for anything new divulged by the Epstein files: “Our CEO never dealt with Epstein or met him, and the files back that up.” With regard, specifically, to the email from Epstein’s assistant, suggesting that Dimon had an evening appointment with Epstein, Evangelista said: “That information was incorrect. Our CEO was never invited to that meeting or dinner.” On whether Dimon retained confidence in Mary Erdoes, whose name records 272 “results” in the justice department’s Epstein library – and whose name still appears to be on JP Morgan’s watchers’ shortlist of successors, Evangelista said: “Mary is one of the most respected executives in finance today and is deeply valued by our CEO, her colleagues and clients. Dimon has never announced a ‘shortlist’ of successors.”On JP Morgan’s embrace of cryptocurrencies: “Jamie’s been clear that our customers have the right to buy the assets of their choice,” Evangelista told me. As for the claim the board is not keeping tabs on Dimon: “Not true. The board is completely independent, with Jamie as the only insider.”If you want to know what Dimon thinks directly from the banker’s mouth, it helps, no doubt, to have personal connections. “My mother is friendly with Dimon’s parents,” Roger Lowenstein, the bestselling author, disclosed in “Jamie Dimon: America’s Least-Hated Banker”, his2010 profileof Dimon for the New York Times,which drew on a months-long entrée into Dimon’s “inner sanctum”. “Dimon sees himself as a patriotic citizen who helped his country in a time of crisis,” Lowenstein writes at the top of the piece, adding at the end: “It has been a while, of course, since a banker dared to speak of his trade as a public service.”Dimon cultivates his not-just-a-banker image by offering, in his annual Letter to Shareholders, wide-ranging assessments of the global political and economic situation, his Olympian pronouncements retailed by the cliquish New York financial press. After one such letter went out in spring 2024, he sat for a videotaped interview with Emma Tucker, editor in chief of the Wall Street Journal.Referring to his musings on the need for “revitalizing our global architecture”, as in a “reimagined Bretton Woods”, Tucker told him that this was the “kind of big thinking you don’t often hear from world leaders”.He received similarly gauzy treatment from Lesley Stahl in her profile, last January, for CBS News’Sunday Morning. Treating Dimon as an all-purpose American oracle, she asked him to account for the loss of popular faith in national institutions like our courts. Asked to explain his longstanding skepticism towards bitcoin, he replied: “It’s used heavily by sex traffickers, money launderers.” Sex traffickers? Here was a cue for Stahl to follow up by observing that Dimon’s bank catered to Epstein’s financial needs. Who needs bitcoin if you’ve got an in with JPMorgan Chase? Nope. The Valentine continued to the end without a single tough question on any aspect of Dimon’s stewardship of his bank – and the same for the extended, 40-minute interview Sunday Morning put online.Big-time global banking, it can be noted, is less “public service” than a perpetual battle for dominance between turf-obsessed rhinos. Dimon is served well by his strategic patience. As he took over as JP Morgan Chase’s CEO, at the start of 2006, a boom in the US housing market was cresting, with large financial institutions of all types loaded up with securitized subprime mortgages and other exotic products. Dimon notably acted with restraint compared with Wall Street peers like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers in not permitting the investment side of his bank to gorge on securities that, in the end, proved highly toxic. In March, 2008, he worked with the Fed and Treasury to acquire Bear Stearns, which was, shockingly, at risk of bankruptcy. “All hail Jamie Dimon!” Barron’s wrote, saluting “The Deal – Rhymes with Steal – of a Lifetime”.The “steal” was that the US Federal Reserve, not Dimon’s bank, purchased some $30bn worth of Bear Stearns’ most toxic assets. JPMorgan Chase, like a number of other big banks, eventually received a multibillion-dollar capital infusion – a federal government lifeline – as part of Washington’s Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as Tarp.JPMorgan Chase repaid the $25bn it received in Tarp assistance “in full and with dividends to US taxpayers”, as Dimon said at the time. Still, Tarp and the handling of the financial crisis gave birth to the rightwing, populist Tea Party movement, as many Americans wondered why a bank like Dimon’s got rescued while their retirement plans did not, and the Tea Party morphed into Maga.The left was angry, too. In 2011, in the heat of the Occupy Wall Street protests, protesters surrounded a Seattle hotel in which Dimon was giving a speech, their aim to flush him outside and administer a “citizen’s arrest”. Police in riot gear dispersed the crowd with pepper spray. But in his speech inside the Sheraton, the banker offered sympathy for the protesters. “They’re right,” he said. “In general, these big institutions of America let them down.”View image in fullscreenDemonstrators from the Occupy Seattle movement protest outside the Sheraton hotel where Dimon in November 2011.Photograph: Stuart Isset/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesSeventeen years after the crisis, the numbers attest to Dimon’s success at, not merely steering his bank through the treacherous waters of that time, but using the crisis to inaugurate an era of accelerated growth. Size definitely matters in banking. JPMorgan Chase, with a network of about 5,000 branches extending to every state of the continental US, has an industry-leading market share of about 16% of the total deposits in US banks, up from about 10% before he became CEO. Domestic assets alone are on the order of $3tn. Worldwide, more than 300,000 employees toil under Dimon, compared to a headcount of about 170,000 when he took charge as CEO. About 10,000 of them work at the bank’s new global headquarters at 270 Park Ave, a freshly constructed sixty-story Manhattan skyscraper, designed by Foster + Partners with the close involvement of Dimon – a glass-and-steel monument to his towering stature.Dimon prides himself on his bank’s bigness, its “fortress balance sheet”, as he likes to say, as proof of its strength. He also vigorously contests the idea that JPMorgan Chase, in banking parlance, is “too big to fail” – that is, so big that if it ever is at risk of foundering, Washington will bail it out with taxpayer money. “The term ‘too big to fail’ must be excised from our vocabulary,” he once wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post.But this is wishful thinking. There is a virtual consensus among financial experts that “too big to fail” remains alive and well – despite legislation enacted by Congress in the wake of the financial crisis to snuff the market’s belief in this guarantee. And JPMorgan Chase, as the biggest of the biggest, is viewed as the epitome of a “too big to fail” bank. “Too big to fail is a fact. It is present. It is real and it will be retained as far as I can see forward,” Hoenig, the former Fed and FDIC official, told me.As a result, “moral hazard”, another pet phrase in the banking world, also remains. That means an enormous bank like JPMorgan Chase might be induced to take more risks with its capital on the bet that Washington, no matter what, won’t let the bank go down. That might apply, say, to the risks that Dimon is now taking with his bank’s activities in the private credit market. Or to the perils of big banks like his, as primary dealers, buying ever larger amounts of US treasuries to meet the federal government’s insatiable need to finance its mounting debt. Should investors come to question the credit-worthiness of the government, the value of the Treasuries held by Dimon’s bank could plummet.How worried is Dimon about a next financial crisis? “We are always on the watch and preparing,” bank spokesman Evangelista told me.In the meantime, Washington has the expectation that Dimon, as Wall Street’s crisis-tested banker, is on 24/7 call to help out as needed, as he did once again in 2023, with his bank’s rescue of the foundering First Republic Bank. He embraces this savior role, a throwback to John Pierpont Morgan, the namesake for Dimon’s bank, and why wouldn’t he? With a 1994 anti-banking concentration law enacted by Congress still peskily on the books, banks that hold 10% or more of total US deposits, as his does, are not permitted to grow by acquiring other banks – except in the case of swallowing failed banks.“I feel like we’re guardians of the financial system,” he told Stahl on CBS’Sunday Morning. That’s one way to look at it. Another is that, better than any of his peers, he has cannily figured out how to make the financial system work to his bank’s advantage. “His role is a reflection of the pathologies of the system,” economist Johnson told me, while offering a tip of the cap: “Mr Dimon is a brilliant player of the power game around finance.”View image in fullscreenJPMorgan Chase & Co celebrates the grand opening of its new megatower at 270 Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan in October 2025.Photograph: Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg/GettyIt might be wondered whether Dimon missed his calling in making banking his sole profession on graduating from Harvard Business School in 1982. After Barack Obama’s re-election to a second term, in 2012, Warren Buffett touted Dimon for treasury secretary. “If we did run into problems in markets, I think he’d actually be the best person you could have in the job,” the financier told the television host Charlie Rose.Perhaps, should a Democrat win the White House in 2028, there’s still time: having survived throat cancer as well as a life-threatening heart condition, Dimon surely has the stamina for the job. But his nomination would be sure to revive awkward questions about his bank’s dealings with Epstein – and what he knew of them. The likelihood, as he has said, is that he will stay on as chairman of the board for a time after handing the reins to a successor as CEO.After reading his Letters to Shareholders over the years and listening to hours of him in varied interview settings, I came to believe that Dimon genuinely thought that what was good for JPMorgan Chase was good for America. And the other way around, too, per the famous 1950s declaration of Charles Wilson as the head of the nation’s biggest manufacturer of automobiles: “For years I thought what was good for the country was good for General Motors, and vice versa.”But here’s the real bottom line: he beat the market. On the last trading day of December 2005, just before Dimon took over as CEO, JPM shares closed at 39.69. On the fourth Friday of this January, they closed 7.5 times higher, at 297.72, compared with 5.5 times higher over this same time span for the S&P 500 index fund.The bank recorded profits of $57bn last year. According to a calculation done by The New York Times,Dimon himself pulled in $770m in 2025 counting salary as well as bonuses, stock grants and other sources of compensation. His spokesman, however, contests that figure. “This number is nonsensical – it seems to be combining paper gains on restricted stock options and 20+ years of equity, more than half of which he purchased on his own,” Evangelista told me. “If you’re talking about what he was awarded in 2025, it would be about $39m.”Dimon is on his fourth president as his bank’s CEO, and he could be in that chair long enough to welcome a fifth, after the 2028 election. Once known as Obama’s “favorite banker”, he won’t win that accolade from Trump, even though the ever pragmatic banker has repositioned his bank to match the Trumpian vibe, not only by giving way for his bank to embrace crypto but also by toning down the bank’s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, known as DEI.View image in fullscreenDimon in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in October 2025.Photograph: Tomas Cuesta/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesAfter the murder of George Floyd in 2020Dimon said: “The black community has been left behind for a long time and a lot of it was structural: jobs, education, stuff like that.” He eventook a kneeat a local bank branch, seemingly in support of the protests that followed Floyd’s death. But now that Trump and his allies have cowed US businesses into dropping the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that blossomed after Floyd, Dimon is sending a different message to his workforce. “I was never a firm believer in bias training,” he told staff last year, according toBloomberg.The only issue on which Dimon has consistently pushed back on Trump is on the need for an independent Fed. And on that matter, Dimon is simply joining a large chorus: virtually everyone on Wall Street, along with the economics profession and prominent Republicans, not just Democrats, has resisted Trump’s typically nasty bid to undermine Jerome Powell to get the Fed chair to lower interest rates. On the much more controversial issue of tariffs, he notes that they could cause inflation but, but folks should just “get over it”, as he said last year as Trump was retaking office.“Get over it” also seems to be his message, implicitly, to those who dwell on his bank’s deep ties to Epstein. Whatever he personally knew about his bank’s involvement with the sex trafficker, he set the tone and the standards for his senior executives, who cultivated Epstein’s lucrative business for years. “Jamie” didn’t act as a “moral compass” – and this wasn’t banking as a “public service”.Paul Starobin is the former Moscow bureau chief ofBusiness Weekand the author of four nonfiction books.paul.starobin@gmail.com"

Core CPI, which strips out the volatile food and energy industries, went up 0.3% over the month.Economists anticipated prices would ease slightly, pushing the annual inflation rate down to 2.5%. The news comes aspollsshow voters souring on Trump’s economic record.Last year, prices fluctuated wildly from spring to fall, going down to 2.3% in April, the lowest in more than four years, then slowly climbing up to 3% by September. By November and December, inflation had fallen to 2.7%.Inflation chartIn a statement, the White House said the new inflation figure was proof that Trump’s “America first agenda continues taming inflation – with no evidence of tariff-induced spikes”.“Today’s expectation-beating CPI report proves that President Trump has defeated Joe Biden’s inflation crisis,” it said. “With inflation now low and stable, America’s economy is set to turbocharge even further through long-overdue interest rate cuts from the Fed.”Wall Street is closely watching this inflation report to estimate its potential impact on interest rates. The Federal Reserveheld offon a rate cut last January, though it is unclear which direction the central bank is leaning before its next board meeting in March.Last month, the Fed chair,Jerome Powell, noted that Trump’s tariffs were still passing through the economy, though he expects they will cause a one-time increase in prices before settling into a new normal.“The expectation is that we will see the effects of tariffs flowing through goods prices, peaking, and then starting to come down,” Powell said. “That’s what we expect to see over the course of this year.”The Fed is also watching the labor market, which showedsigns of strengthin January, though overall jobs growth in 2025 was revised down. In 2025, 181,000 jobs were added to the economy, compared with 2m in 2024, after revisions.The White House has largely looked past last year’s jobs numbers, with Trump touting growth in gross domestic product and price stability seen last fall. “We’ll go down as the greatest first year in history that nobody’s ever had, just based on the numbers,” Trumpsaidin January.But recent polling suggests American voters disapprove of Trump’s handling of the economy. A February Economist/YouGovpollshowed 37% of American voters approve of his job performance – the lowest percentage across his first and second terms so far. Though the dip largely comes from the president’s handling ofimmigration, among all issues mentioned in the poll Trump’s lowest approval was on inflation.This posestrouble for Republicansheading into the midterms. Trump ran on heavy promises to tackle high prices, but the president’s focus on tariffs and immigration has left voters weary.The White House appears to be aware of its growing problem on prices. In recent weeks, Trump rolled outmeasuresaddressing affordability, including proposals addressinghousingprices,credit card debtanddrugprices.Explore more on these topicsUS economyInflationTrump tariffsTariffsUS politicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Ruemmler had a large number of communications with Epstein from 2014 to 2019, even after the disgraced financier’s 2008 guilty plea for procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution, the documents showed.These communications included advising Epstein on how to respond to a media inquiry in 2019 concerning the alleged special legal treatment he received because of his connections, the emails show. The correspondence also showed Ruemmler received expensive gifts from Epstein, and repeatedly called him “Uncle Jeffrey”.“I was a defence attorney when I dealt with Jeffrey Epstein,” Ruemmler had told Reuters on 3 February.Epstein later died in prison while awaiting child sex-trafficking charges in August 2019.During her time in private practice after she left the White House in 2014, Ruemmler received several gifts from Epstein, including luxury handbags and a fur coat.“So lovely and thoughtful! Thank you to Uncle Jeffrey!!!” she wrote to him in 2018.Historically, Wall Street frowns on gift-giving between clients and bankers or Wall Street lawyers, particularly high-end gifts that could pose a conflict of interest.Goldman Sachs requires its employees to get pre-approval before receiving gifts from clients or giving them, according to the company’s code of conduct, partly in order to not run afoul of anti-bribery laws.Will the Epstein files tarnish the reputation of Jamie Dimon, America’s banker?Read moreEpstein also telephoned Ruemmler when he was arrested on 6 July 2019, among other calls he made that night, according to two documents that cited notes from law enforcement officials.A separate note by the FBI cited Epstein as saying on the same day: “Is this about sex trafficking. Is this about underage.” The author of the FBI document, who was not named, said Epstein also made utterances including: “Oh this is bad, this is pretty bad.”Ruemmler was part of the leadership at Goldman, among the top executive officers of the Wall Street firm. As late as December, its chief executive, David Solomon, described Ruemmler as an “excellent lawyer” and said she had his full faith and backing.On Thursday, Solomon said: “As one of the most accomplished professionals in her field, Kathy has also been a mentor and friend to many of our people, and she will be missed. I accepted her resignation, and I respect her decision.”“I reluctantly accepted her, her resignation,” he added in an interview with CNBC on Friday morning. “But I respect her decision.”Reuters and the Associated Press contributed reportingGet in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

A significant driver of recent growth has been Claude Code, the company’s AI-powered coding tool that became generally available in May 2025.Anthropic’s rival OpenAI, backed by Microsoft and SoftBank, has been assembling what is reportedly a far larger round of up to $100bn that would value the ChatGPT developer at about $830bn.The staggering sums being raised reflect equally staggering burn rates, with the companies spending cash to cover their huge costs of computing and attracting researcher talent.Anthropic has forecast reducing its cash burn to roughly a third of revenue in 2026 and just 9% by 2027, with a break-even target of 2028 – two years ahead of its rival, according to reports. Both companies are widely expected to pursue initial public offerings in the second half of 2026.The rapid valuation increases for leading AI startups such as Anthropic and OpenAI, whose price tags far exceed those of many ofthe US’s largest listed companies, has alarmed some observers. Last year, a leading British tech investor, James Anderson, said he found sharp increases in valuations of companies such asOpenAI and Anthropic “disconcerting”.Some listed firms at the forefront of the AI industry have also come under stock market pressure in recent days.Shares in Alphabet, Google’s parent company, have fallen by 4.2% so far this week, indicating some investors are still spooked by the big AI-related spending plans it laid outthis month. Meta has declined by 1.7% during this week. Shares in Nvidia, a leading chipmaker and key provider of AI infrastructure, dropped by 1.6% on Thursday amid a wider sell-off but have been flat on the week.“A gloomy session on Wall Street on Thursday put investors in a grumpy mood at the end of the trading week,” said Russ Mould, the investment director at investment platform AJ Bell.“Association with AI has gone from party to peril as investors reappraise what the technology means for companies.“Some are concerned about excessive levels of spending and others fear AI will disrupt multiple industries. It all adds up to a cocktail of worries and that’s bad for market sentiment more broadly,” Mould added.Founded in 2021 by the siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, both former executives at OpenAI, Anthropic has positioned itself as a safety-focused alternative in the AI race.The funding round also comes shortly after Anthropic’s first television commercials were broadcast during Super Bowl LX, using the campaign to emphasise that its products remain ad-free. The ads took an apparent jab at OpenAI, which has begun to introduce advertising into the free version of ChatGPT.Anthropic’s earlier backers include Amazon, which has invested $8bn and serves as a primary computing partner through its datacentres, as well as Google, which invested $2bn in 2023.Agence France-Presse contributed to this articleExplore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)Technology sectorComputingChatbotsnewsShareReuse this content"

Repeated doziness at the back has cost them. They have held commanding advantages against Charlton, Crystal Palace, Wolves and Leeds, only to give away silly goals. It is a bad habit and proved costly when a 2-0 lead was squanderedduring Tuesday’s draw with Leeds. Rosenior was livid afterwards, and is waiting for a consistent performance. Chelsea travel to Hull , Rosenior’s former club, on Friday night. They will surely advance against Championship opponents, but how they do it will matter. It is time for them to get serious.Jacob SteinbergHull City v Chelsea, Friday 7.45pm (all times GMT)2Hammers seek another morale boostA nervy victory against QPRin the third round sparked West Ham’s ongoing mini-revival. The FA Cup is far from their biggest priority this season but it has given Nuno Espírito Santo’s side momentum in their fight to stay up. They have taken 10 points from five league games since beating QPR and are increasingly optimistic about their survival chances before taking on lowly League One opponents in Burton Albion. Nuno will probably make changes – Jarrod Bowen looks in need of a rest – but he should not view the Cup as a mere inconvenience.JSBurton Albion v West Ham, Saturday 12.15pmView image in fullscreenWest Ham’s win over QPR in the third round ended a 10-game winless run and sparked a league revival.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PA3Could Burnley do a Wigan?Burnley’s unlikely comeback at Crystal Palace notwithstanding, most would expect the jig to be up for the Clarets so far as continued membership of the Premier League goes. But even if that’s the case,that eyebrow-raising resultproves Scott Parker’s side are still competitive. Think back to Wigan in 2013, who enjoyed a mostly kind path to FA Cup glory (Bournemouth in their League One guise, Macclesfield, Huddersfield, Millwall) with the two obvious exceptions of Everton away and Manchester City in the quarter-final and final respectively. Burnley have already punted in-form Millwall out of the Cup, and should have more than enough to deal with Mansfield, so get over this hurdle and the odds of becoming only the second club to win the FA Cup while going down get that little bit shorter. What’s the point in sport if you can’t dream big? It’s the most realistic way to keep Burnley’s season alive a while longer, if nothing else.Scott MurrayBurnley vMansfield, Saturday 3pm4Saints can rub salt in Leicester’s woundsSouthampton fans would have been fearing the worst when three goals down at half-time at Leicester on Tuesday night.That9-0 wasn’t so long ago. Those worries were banished in gloriously absurd fashion as Tonda Eckert’s team, who were still 3-1 down with nine minutes of regulation time remaining, turned things around to seal a 4-3 victory for the ages. Thrillingly the two teams meet again in the Cup on Saturday. Saints have turned a bit of a corner under Eckert after reverting to four at the back and, while much may depend on whether the popular but brittle Ross Stewart is risked to lead the line ahead of Cameron Archer, Saints will go into this match brimming with confidence after the midweek madness. Leicester’s 2021 FA Cup triumph suddenly seems an awfully long time ago. Southampton’s 1976 victoryactually is… but as the last-but-one second-tier club to lift the Cup, their dreams of doing it again burn brighter than they would have done during the break at the King Power.SMSouthampton v Leicester, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenShea Charles celebrates his late winner at the King Power Stadium in Tuesday’s dramatic Championship clash.Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images5Salford hope to avoid fresh thrashingThirteen monthsafter being drubbed 8-0by Manchester City in the third round, Salford are back at the Etihad Stadium in the fourth. Karl Robinson is still the manager and his side are sixth in League Two, having lost two of their past three games, after finishing eighth last term.

They failed to do so on the opening day at the season at Villa Park, although neither Nick Woltemade nor Yoane Wissa had completed their transfers to the Magpies at that stage. Both strikers did feature inlast month’s limp 2-0 home reverseto Unai Emery’s side, in which Newcastle’s bluntness proved a sign of things to come. That defeat began a run of five games without a win in all competitions, ended onlyby Dr Tottenhamin midweek; a game in which Eddie Howe opted to start both Woltemade and Wissa on the bench, preferring Anthony Gordon in the middle of a more fluid frontline. It will be telling if the duo, bought for a combined £125m in the summer, are substitutes once again in the Cup.Dominic BoothAston Villa v Newcastle, Saturday 5.45pmView image in fullscreenAnthony Gordon led the line for Newcastle in Tuesday’s 2-1 victory at Tottenham.Photograph: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United/Getty Images7Slot will do struggling Hürzeler no favoursBrighton fans have been treated with, at best, disregard and, at worst, contempt by the decision to show their trip to Liverpool on TNT Sports at 8pm on a Saturday. After one win in 13 league games, losing to an 86th-minute own goal at Aston Villa on Wednesday, and amiddiminishing faith in Fabian Hürzeler, their latest headache will be getting home from Anfield, particularly if the tie goes to extra time and penalties. The only consolation would be a repeat of their third-round success at Manchester United – Brighton’s last win in any competition – and a performance to support Hürzeler’s conviction he can turn the tide of disapproval. He should expect few favours from Arne Slot’s team selection. With Liverpool out of the title race and chasing Champions League qualification, the importance of this season’s FA Cup is not lost on the head coach. Slot needs his team to build on their valuablewin at Sunderland in midweek.Andy HunterLiverpool v Brighton, Saturday 8pm8Buoyant Blues smell upset chanceA familiar face will be absent from the St Andrew’s directors’ box on Sunday. Birmingham’s chair, Tom Wagner, recently suffered a stroke and although the 56-year-old American financier is reported to be recovering well in hospital, he is expected to take an extended period of medical leave. Wagner, who took control of the club in 2023, will miss what promises to be an intriguing litmus test of Birmingham’s potential. The Blues are prospering in the Championship under the intelligent management of Chris Davies, just a point adrift of a playoff place. Leeds have no desire to return to the second tier after promotion and, despite encouraging Premier League form, Daniel Farke may harbour mixed feelings about an extended Cup run. It would not be a shock if Dominic Calvert-Lewin was rested, and it would be unwise to bet against a minor upset.Louise TaylorBirminghamv Leeds, Sunday noonView image in fullscreenDaniel Farke may not put too much emphasis on the FA Cup, with Leeds fighting for Premier League survival.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images9Safe Sunderland to shuffle their packWith the hosts locked in a Championship relegation battle and Sunderland virtually assured of Premier League survival, the prospect of an FA Cup adventure will surely appeal to Régis Le Bris. A run towards Wembley would also allow Sunderland’s manager to offer fringe players like Melker Ellborg, Luke O’Nien, Lutsharel Geertruida and Chris Rigg some welcome starts. It would be particularly interesting for visiting fans to catch a first sight of Ellborg, recently arrived from Malmö to serve as Robin Roefs’ goalkeeping understudy, while the chance to rest Nordi Mukiele and Enzo Le Fée would be welcome. Rigg’s career has stalled a little since the gifted local academy graduate was hyped as one of Europe’s most promising midfielders. He is still only 18 but, perhaps as much as anyone, Rigg would benefit from a rare first-team start. O’Nien, meanwhile, remains the hugely popular club captain and shone in thethird-round win at Everton.LTOxford United v Sunderland, Sunday 2pm10Lewis-Skelly eyes rare midfield chanceThe exceptional depth of his squad this season has allowed Mikel Arteta to field an entirely different starting lineup in some games asArsenaljuggle the demands of being in four competitions in mid-February. But with Mikel Merino absent due to a stress fracture in his foot and Ethan Nwaneri on loan at Marseille, Arsenal are short of options in midfield. Could this Cup tie against struggling Wigan be an opportunity to give Myles Lewis-Skelly a runout in his favourite position? The 19-year-old burst on to the scene last season at left-back but has been behind Riccardo Calafiori and Piero Hincapié in the pecking order this campaign and looks unlikely to be in Thomas Tuchel’s World Cup squad as a result. Lewis-Skelly made his name in Arsenal’s academy as a bustling midfielder and his energy suggests he could thrive in Declan Rice’s box-to-box role against League One opponents.Ed AaronsArsenal vWigan Athletic, Sunday 4.30pmExplore more on these topicsFA CupHull CityChelseaBurton AlbionWest Ham UnitedManchester CitySalford CityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Friday night on the southern outskirts of Milan, the Olympic Games reminded the sport, and perhaps Malinin himself, that predictability is never guaranteed on its biggest stage.The overwhelming favorite entering the free skate, the 21-year-old American instead saw the Olympic title slip away to Kazakhstan’s Mikhail Shaidorov after an error-strewn performance that will go down among the biggest shocks in figure skating history.Winter Olympics: Ilia Malinin misses podium in figure skating shock; Shaidorov takes gold – as it happenedRead moreShaidorov’s season-best total of 291.58 vaulted him from fifth after the short program as one favored contender after another faltered. Japan’s Yuma Kagiyama (280.06) and Shun Sato (274.90) took silver and bronze respectively on a night where even the sport’s most reliable jump technicians struggled to hold their programs together.Malinin entered the final segment with a lead of just over five points, a margin that under normal circumstances would have allowed him to skate conservatively and still win. It wasn’t to be.Malinin was the last of the 24 skaters to take to the ice, with the Olympic title seemingly within reach after his closest rivals faltered. He opened with a quad flip and quad lutz, but the mistakes quickly piled up. The planned quad axel was reduced to a single and later he fell on another quad lutz. He also doubled jumps he would normally complete with more rotations, though he salvaged points with a quad toe loop combination.View image in fullscreenGold medalist Mikhail Shaidorov shakes hands with Ilia Malinin after the finish.Photograph: Yara Nardi/ReutersHe finished with 156.33 in the free skate and 264.49 overall, left shockingly off the podium in a distant eighth place, nearly 30 points adrift of Shaidorov.The invincibility that has defined Malinin’s competitive aura over the past two seasons had been shattered.“I blew it,” Malinin said afterward. “That’s honestly the first thing that came to my mind. There’s no way that just happened. I was preparing the whole season and was so confident in my program, so confident with everything. I have no words really.”The result ended an unbeaten streak of more than two years spanning 14 competitions, including two world titles and three consecutive Grand Prix final victories. Entering the Milano Cortina Games, Malinin had redefined the technical boundaries of the sport, becoming the only skater in history toland the quadruple axel in competitionand building programs around record-level quad difficulty.Yet even before Friday, his Olympic experience had shown flashes of vulnerability. He was beaten by Kagiyama in the team event short program and later admitted the pressure of competing on Olympic ice had initially overwhelmed him. While he rebounded to help the United Statessecure team gold, his performances lacked the usual sense of technical inevitability.By Tuesday’s individual short program, that swagger appeared restored. Malinin took a five-point lead that felt insurmountable given his planned seven-quad free skate layout – the most difficult program ever attempted at the Olympics. At a practice at the US team’s alternate base in Bergamo hours before the final, he reportedly did not fall once. Then came a performance that will leave scars for years to come.“Definitely not a pleasant feeling,” Malinin said. “Training up all these years, going up to it, it honestly went by so fast. I didn’t have time to process what to do or anything. It all happens so fast.”By the end Malinin was skating largely for pride rather than placement. After he struck his final pose, he was visibly distraught.“The pressure of the Olympics really gets you,” Malinin said. “People say that there’s an Olympic curse, that the Olympic gold medal favorite is always going to skate bad at the Olympics. So that’s what happens.“The pressure is unreal. It’s really not easy, but I’m still proud of being able to get to the finish.”For the 21-year-old Shaidorov, the moment marked a career breakthrough and a milestone for Kazakhstan. His clean, composed free skate – built on five quads – including a quad lutz, toeloop and quad flip – proved exactly the type of performance that wins Olympic titles when favorites unravel. He looked as surprised as anyone when the final scores flashed and his placement was official.View image in fullscreenMikhail Shaidorov is Kazakhstan’s first Olympic champion in figure skating.Photograph: Wang Zhao/AFP/Getty ImagesHe became the first Kazakh Olympic figure skating champion, delivering his country’s first gold medal at these Games and its first gold in any Winter Olympic sport since Lillehammer 1994.Kagiyama’s silver marked his second consecutive Olympic runner-up finish, reinforcing his reputation as one of the sport’s most reliable championship performers. Sato’s bronze on his Olympic debut completed a strong night for Japan, whose technical depth again showed on the sport’s biggest stage.From vertigo to Van Gogh: 10 things you may have missed at the Winter OlympicsRead moreInside the arena, the atmosphere shifted from anticipation to disbelief as the standings solidified. What had seemed to be a coronation for Malinin instead became a reminder of the Olympic reality: that even generational dominance can dissolve in seven minutes of skating.For Malinin, the defeat is unlikely to change the broader trajectory of his career. At 21, he remains the sport’s most technically gifted skater and the architect of its current technical revolution. But on this night, Olympic history belonged to someone else. And for the first time in years, men’s figure skating suddenly feels open again.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Ilia MalininFigure skatingWinter OlympicsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Not unlike a trial. A single rubbered heartbeat thumps in our collective throats. In basketball litigation, the verdict is televised and delivered in public by the referee’s whistle. Deni Avdija faced more trials than a career criminal in early January, when he scored 41 points in the Portland Trail Blazers’ win over the Houston Rockets. Twenty-eight came from the field. The other 13 were handed to him at the stripe.The online response was immediate, echoing the criticism that has followed the Israeli all season: he’s a free-throw merchant. It’s a specific kind of hoops pejorative – not quite cheating, but a kind of outsourcing, farming points out to the refs. After the game, Rockets forward Tari Eason was asked what makes Avdija so difficult to guard. His answer was one word: “Zebras.”Free throws piss us off because they’re a successful grift, like follow-up emails. And Avdija has made them work this season – he is second in the league in free-throw attempts per game, and third in free-throws made. That production has made him as the frontrunner for theMost Improved Player awardand earned hisfirst All-Star reserve role,finishing aheadof LeBron James and Kevin Durant in the second fan-voting returns. The Trail Blazers look poised to make the play-in, which would be their first postseason appearance since 2021.But visibility invites scrutiny. Since arriving in Portland in 2024 and being empowered as a point-forward, Avdija has played with a downhill, neurotic energy. He strikes a contrapposto pose before diving into carnage, absorbing all the unseen elbows and shit talk, and yes, waiting for the call. Fans mock this kind of stuff … unless their team’s superstar employs it. While elite floppers such as James Harden or Shai Gilgeous-Alexander are criticized for on-court shenanigans, the ire leveled at Avdija spills into judgments about who he is and where he is from.Pride and unease: US Winter Olympians navigate politics, patriotism and Trump attacksRead moreThis isn’t a defense of Avdija’s politics, nor an attempt to launder them through basketball. As Avdija’s notoriety rises, so will the criticism. The internet gases up entropy. So we’ve seen the basketball insults devolve. Terrorist. Genocidal. An already controversial athlete has been transformed into a proxy for the slaughter of Palestinians in Gaza. But we should be able to criticize what Avdija has said without pretending that the way he plays is a reflection of Israel’s bloodshed in Gaza.The scrutiny doesn’t emerge from nowhere. As an Israeli, Avdija is one of the very fewNBAplayers with publicly documented service in the Israel Defense Forces. Avdija was born on a kibbutz in northern Israel and enlisted in April 2020, during the NBA’s pandemic pause, under Israel’s mandatory conscription system. That fact is searchable. It’s certainly been passed around. Since Israel’s large-scale bombing of Gaza, it’s calcified into an accusation.I believe Israel’s actions in Gaza are genocide. All the world has forsaken Palestine. But we don’t need to lie to make a point. Avdija has not committed war crimes. There’s no evidence tying him to specific acts of violence against civilians, and he completed his service in North America playing basketball. He served before the Gaza bloodshed, when he was only 19, an age old enough to serve, but young enough for someone not to have developed iron-clad views. Claims require proof. The wordcrimeis reserved for actions that can be demonstrated, not simply inferred to fit confirmation bias.Some argue that serving in the IDF is itself a war crime. That’s an impossible, specious standard. To collapse all service into criminality is to abandon the distinction between institutional violence and personal culpability. That distinction is the only thing separating accountability from chaos.So Avdija clearly isn’t the enemy here, even though I’m not rooting for him either. The real sins come from way higher up the ladder. People are rightly furious our US tax dollars continue to fund a genocide. It began under a Democrat, Joe Biden, and continues under a Republican, Donald Trump. We struggle just sitting with our anger. So we strike out with balled fists – at someone we can project our rage upon, and Avdija is an easy target, notthetarget.States commit atrocities. Governments lie. Militaries enforce policy. Individuals exist within those systems, sometimes complicit, sometimes constrained, and occasionally wrong without being criminal. There’s another complication. Avdija is a Zionist. That is, if the word is used according toits dictionary definition– which includes someone being “a supporter of modern Israel” – rather than as slur.In a March 2025 interviewwith Israel Hayom, Avdija said, “I love Israel”, and described representing his country as a source of pride and responsibility. Avdija has also said, “not everyone understands 100% what’s happening in Israel”, adding that he tries to explain the situation “from the right good side.”Zionism doesn’t imply criminality, but fans are entitled to criticize Avdija’s national pride when he’s been totally silent about the mass Palestinian civilian deaths at the hands of his home country. When images of destroyed neighborhoods and dead children routinely circulate across social feeds, neutrality can’t be viewed as a serious position. And Avdija continues to express his support for Israel despite its actions. In arecent profile in the Athletic, Avdija expressed anger at Israel’s critics and at how politics and basketball are routinely linked with him.“I’m an athlete. I don’t really get into politics, because it’s not my job,” Avdija said. “I obviously stand for my country, because that’s where I’m from. It’s frustrating to see all the hate. Like, I have a good game or get All-Star votes, and all the comments are people connecting me to politics. Like, why can’t I just be a good basketball player? Why does it matter if I’m from Israel, or wherever in the world, or what my race is? Just respect me as a basketball player.”This is the trap: he wants the benefits of nationalism without any accountability for what that nationalism is doing in the world. Maybe Avdija genuinely believes Israel’s actions in Gaza are fine, which is his right. But he shouldn’t be surprised – or complain – when he gets backlash for wading into the subject.And athletes have shown you can love aspects of your country – your family, your friends, the ideals it is supposed to represent – while also being deeply uncomfortable about its actions. Under Trump, we have seen children snatched away by federal officials, citizens shot dead in the streets, and our supposed allies threatened and insulted. When asked about representing the US at the Winter Olympics last week, freestyle skier Hunter Hess eloquentlyexpressed his ambivalence.“It brings up mixed emotions to represent the US right now … It’s a little hard. There’s obviously a lot going on that I’m not the biggest fan of, and I think a lot of people aren’t. I think for me it’s more I’m representing my friends and family back home, the people that represented it before me, all the things that I believe are good about the US,” Hess said.But just because Hess’s views are noble doesn’t make him a better skier – though it may make him easier to root for. And just because Avdija’s comments are, at best, tone deaf it doesn’t mean he’s a worse basketball player. It’s possible to be furious about the Gaza bloodbath – and our tax dollars funding it – without collapsing the argument, lazily, into a basketball debate. It’s far more important than that. Especially when the jazzed-up thump of online dribble is easier to referee. The danger isn’t that Avdija escapes criticism. The danger is that in making crucial debates into arguments about basketball, we lose sight of what is really important.Otherwise, anything can become an indictment – even a free throw.Explore more on these topicsNBAPortland Trail BlazersBasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Loons aren’t known for paying sizable transfer fees, and their wage bill last year was the league’s fifth-smallest.This year, they also had to contend with Operation Metro Surge. The siege-like deployment of more than 3,000 federal immigration agents into the state of Minnesota is nowdue to end, but only after three harrowing months for residents throughout the Minneapolis/Saint Paul metro area and beyond. The occupation caused two confirmed deaths, with Renee Good and Alex Pretti slain by ICE agents.Nonetheless, Minnesota United have managed to recruit one of this generation’s biggest stars, Colombia playmaker James Rodríguez.The five most noteworthy MLS kits of 2026: Tie-dye, Tina Turner and moreRead more“I’ve been in top leagues, but I wanted to play in this league,” Rodríguez said in his introduction at Allianz Field. “When the chance arose with this great club, things were progressing a bit slowly, but it happened. Both sides made an effort, and when a club trusts you, you have to give it your all so everyone feels good. That’s why I’m here, to help and hopefully win things.”Rodríguez arrives nearly half a decade removed from his tenure at Everton, which proved to be his final stop as the centerpiece of a major European club. His path from the Premier League toMLSmakes for good pub trivia: Al-Rayyan, Olympiacos, São Paulo, Rayo Vallecano, Club León.One would be forgiven for struggling to picture him in most of those clubs’ shirts, as Rodríguez’s legacy continues to be most directly associated with his exploits for Colombia. He’s readying for his fourth World Cup, having captained his country to their best showing in Conmebol qualification since 2014 after being named player of the tournament at the 2024 Copa América.A free agent since New Year’s, he needed a club with whom he could prepare for this summer’s tournament. Having secured the player’s discovery rights in the fall, Minnesota chief soccer officer Khaled El-Ahmad saw a “unique opportunity” to boost the entire squad, calling MLS “the best league to be in at this time when you’re preparing for the World Cup”.There’s some historical backing for that claim. Gareth Bale was similarly driven to train in world-class facilities ahead of the 2022 World Cup,latching on to Los Angeles FCfor half a season, whileBrazil goalkeeper Júlio Césarsigned a short-term deal with Toronto FC before the 2014 World Cup.“How does a player of that caliber and that history prepare?” El-Ahmad told the Guardian before Friday’s press conference. “What energy would that bring to our culture as we’re trying to get younger, adding him to our collective? Adding that dimension, I believe, will evolve the group.”El-Ahmad quickly summarizes Rodríguez’s priorities and how the club meets them. He wanted a team that performs well; Minnesota expects to maintain its competitive standard, having missed the postseason just once since 2019. He wanted a top physio department; Minnesota was honored asMLS medical staff of the year in 2025.He wanted calmness away from the field; “we have the best fans, but they don’t show up at your house or hotel,” El-Ahmad assures with history backing him up. He has a big interest in the NBA; managing partner Bill McGuire has courtside seats for the Timberwolves.View image in fullscreenJames Rodríguez and Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert pose for a photo after the Colombian’s introduction.Photograph: Jordan Johnson/NBAE/Getty ImagesAnd then there’s the club culture, which El-Ahmad hopes he has refined since being appointed in November 2023, having previously been a scout for City Football Group and the CEO of Barnsley.“If this was 2024 or maybe even 2025, I’m not sure we would be ready as a club for that potential addition to our culture,” El-Ahmad said. “I’m so confident in the coaching staff now, in the club itself, that we’ve been evolving over the last 24 months heading into year three. I’m very comfortable with the core group of players, that [Rodríguez] is an exciting cherry on the top.“[The acquisition] is not to change the culture. It’s to evolve the group.”If there’s a recent MLS comparison, Thomas Müller’s arrival in Vancouver last summer feels apt. It worked out for the Whitecaps, with the German bolstering a strong side as they reached their first MLS Cup final.El-Ahmad confirmed that despite his profile, Rodríguez won’t take up one of the club’s limited designated player (DP) spots even if the club picks up his option for the back half of 2026. He also won’t disrupt head coach Cameron Knowles’ playing time plans more than any other new signing would.Inter Miami have reloaded for 2026 in a way no other MLS team could haveRead more“Our culture doesn’t guarantee starts for any player,” El-Ahmad said. “It’s a conversation about workload. Will this one be more delicate? Of course. There’s no way not to have the delicate conversation, but it’s also delicate with our captain, Michael Boxall. Does he recover more? Does he need an extra rest? Because Boxall is going through the same thing: he’s going to go into the World Cup [with New Zealand]. It’s the same thing with [Panama defender] Carlos Harvey. What does that mean the week before they go into the international camp in March?”It’s a collectivist tone that seems welcome for Rodríguez, who becomes the first Loon to don the 10 shirt since Emanuel Reynoso in 2023.“From what I’ve seen, this is a club that has done things the right way,” Rodríguez said. “I’ve come to an established club, and now I’m just another member of the club and the team as well. I’m eager, passionate, and ready to be a part of the club, and I hope to do things right.”As for questions of how bought into the club Rodríguez will be following the World Cup, El-Ahmad cited “good, transparent conversation” as the two sides settled on the contract’s structure. After consulting his locker room leaders for input, El-Ahmad was confident reasonable risks were being avoided.“Again, it’s a club option,” El-Ahmad said. “He’s talking about, OK, so how are we going to make this a longer deal? It’s all going to come down to how we align our interests and performance, what impact [he makes], if he likes it. There’s a lot of assumptions and unknowns, but we are really starting out from a very positive place.”The positivity in tandem with the welcome news of US Immigrations and Custom Enforcement’s impending withdrawal from Minnesota – a sorely needed silver lining.“I think there’s no way around it: it’s been very mentally tough,” El-Ahmad said of life under Operation Metro Surge. “Standing in front of the players, asking a certain group of the players to take care of the other group of the players, creating specific WhatsApp groups to support certain groups within the club.”View image in fullscreenMinnesota United made a run to the Western Conference semi-final last season.Photograph: Jordan Johnson/Minnesota United FC/MLS/Getty ImagesMinnesota United never made a public statement regarding the occupation – perhaps understandable given the Trump administration’s culture of retribution, but still a decision questioned by some fans. Local businesses and citizens saw hastily written warrants mere hours after speaking out against ICE or recording their activity, feelingsuch actions were tactics of retaliation.One of the few public comments addressing the situation was made by Boxall and Joaquín Pereyra,speaking to the St Paul Pioneer Pressin January. Both were critical of the operation and leadership at all levels, with Pereyra adding that he carries his Argentine passport and green card with him whenever he leaves home.“I empathize with Joaquín,” said El-Ahmad who wasborn in Lebanonbefore his family moved to Sweden when he was young. “I also drive around with my passport and green card. My kids have an extra note in their bag, just in case mom and dad don’t come home, which, in its instance, is something that brings back childhood memories of me being a war refugee. It’s not a pleasant thing to carry.“At the same time, I’m really, really proud of the players and the staff and how we’ve really managed it. It’s not easy when you’re preparing for a season, and then you see the pictures in our community that are not normal and they should not be happening. It’s not even about political views. For me, it’s about human values and human decisions and what is right and what is wrong. With the things I’ve seen, I empathize and stand behind the community. We see a lot of wrong things being done.”In the interim, the team is far from home at the Coachella Valley Invitational, a California preseason event involving Minnesota and 11 other MLS sides. The Loons won their first tune-up match two days after unveiling Rodríguez, notching a 3-0 win over Sporting Kansas City.Rodríguez didn’t participate and won’t join future training sessions until he obtains his work visa – another aspect of the signing impossibly linked to the Trump administration. The Pioneer Press also reported that at least two potential international signings decided not to join Minnesota in light of ICE’s occupation.MLS to cut a quarter of Spanish-language broadcast talent on Apple TV, according to sourcesRead moreGiventhe tension between Trump and Colombia president Gustavo Petro, the political situation was another item El-Ahmad discussed with Rodríguez’s representatives.“I think it’s different with James because of the profile he has,” El-Ahmad said. “He feels more comfortable about his situation compared to some other recruits that we tried to sign. His representatives asked about what’s going on since he’s obviously Colombian. I don’t want to make this political, but it’s not easy. We’re still waiting for the visa for Mauricio González, who we signed like a month ago.”In a turbulent time for Minnesota, its MLS team now rosters one of the sport’s most famous active players. Rodríguez is determined to impress, both to round out his World Cup preparations and to make the most of his move to the North American league.In a deal with little risk involved for the club, his arrival is a surprising but welcome development in an offseason like no other.“This is the right place for him because of the community,” El-Ahmad said, “how we stand up to each other, the fans, the group of players that we have. He will be a good addition here, and they are a good addition to where he is [in his career]. Hopefully, we can manage it as we move forward for what everyone hopes is a positive outcome.”Explore more on these topicsMinnesota UnitedColombiaMLSUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

ISU officials told the Guardian that meant a number of the French judge’s highest marks were effectively discounted in the final calculation.The reassurance comes as scrutiny focuses on the scoring submitted by the French judge on the nine-member panel. In the free dance, the judge awarded the French pair nearly eight points more than the American team – a margin large enough that, had that score been excluded, Chock and Bates would have moved into the gold medal position.Under current rules, teams have limited avenues to challenge results unless the ISU itself elects to review judging conduct. There has been no indication that such a review is forthcoming.The controversy has renewed debate about subjectivity in figure skating scoring. An online petition calling for the ISU and International Olympic Committee (IOC) to investigate the judgingapproached 15,000 signaturesby Friday afternoon, reflecting widespread unease among viewers and some within the sport.Chock and Bates have largely avoided direct criticism of the judging panel, instead emphasising their pride in their performance and gratitude for fan support. The Americans, who delivered what they described as the strongest skate of their careers, produced a season-best performance and finished with 224.39 points – fewer than two points behind the French champions’ season-high total of 225.82.“We felt like we delivered our absolute best performance that we could have,” Bates said. “It was our Olympic moment. It felt like a winning skate to us and that’s what we’re going to hold on to.”View image in fullscreenAmerican duo Evan Bates and Madison Chock produced a season-best performance in the Olympic ice dance final.Photograph: Yara Nardi/ReutersThe couple – who were unbeaten over the past three seasons in all but one competition, when they finished second to 2026 Olympic bronze medallists Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier of Canada – said they had not analysed the scoring in detail but acknowledged hearing about the petition circulating online.“It means a lot that people are voicing their opinions on our behalf,” Bates said.Chock said the wave of public support helped soften the disappointment of finishing second after years of chasing an individual Olympic medal. The silver medal completed a milestone achievement for the pair, who finally secured the Olympic ice dance medal that had eluded them in three previous Games, in addition to theirteam event gold medalsearlier in the week.Still, she warned that opaque judging outcomes risk damaging the sport’s connection with fans.“Any time the public is confused by results, it does a disservice to our sport,” Chock said. “People need to understand what they’re cheering for and feel confident in the sport they’re supporting.”The French victory also drew attention because the partnership is relatively new at the highest level of international competition. Fournier Beaudry switched national representation to France and made her international debut with Cizeron only last autumn, in the wake ofassault and abuse allegationsinvolving each of their former partners. The pair quickly established themselves as contenders by winning the European Championships earlier this season.The judging debate also revived memories of one of the sport’s most infamous Olympic controversies, when allegations of vote-trading at the 2002 Salt Lake City Games triggered investigations and eventually led to the awarding of duplicate gold medals in pairs skating. That scandal prompted the ISU to abandon the longstanding 6.0 system in favour of the current judging structure, which combines element-based technical scores with programme component marks evaluating performance quality, skating skills and choreography.Winter Olympics 2026: Heraskevych’s appeal rejected by Cas, Klæbo seals treble, GB drought goes on – liveRead moreWhile the newer system was designed to reduce the impact of individual judges, critics have long argued that it remains difficult for casual audiences to understand, reduces the sport to a jumping contest and still allows room for subjectivity.The latest dispute has amplified those concerns. Analysts noted that while five of the nine judges placed Chock and Bates ahead of the French team, the larger margin from the French judge ultimately shaped the final standings.The scoring debate has also centred on the performance details. Fournier Beaudry and Cizeron produced a technically strong programme but were perceived by some observers to have benefited despite visible errors, including a noticeable mistake during a twizzle sequence. Meanwhile, the Americans delivered a nearly flawless skate, intensifying questions about how component scores were evaluated.For Chock and Bates, however, the emotional toll of the Olympic schedule – which included four performances across team and individual events in less than a week – left little time to dwell on controversy.“We haven’t fully processed everything that’s happened,” Bates said. “It took all of our mental and physical energy just to stay locked in.” Chock echoed that sentiment, framing the Olympic experience as larger than a single result.“A medal is a medal,” she said. “The Olympic dream is something that lives inside you. That’s what drives you.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026US sportsWinter OlympicsFigure skatingUSA Olympic teamFrance Olympic teamnewsShareReuse this content"

Germany’s Philipp Raimund sat it out – he suffers from vertigo. “From time to time, I have the issue that my body is reacting without me controlling it,” he said. “It’s like I am just observing myself while something has a tight grip on me.”Still without a World Cup win on his CV heading to these Games, the 25-year-old Raimund stunned the field, including sixth-placed Prevc, and himself to win gold in Monday’s normal hill individual event with jumps of 135.6m and 138.5m. “I don’t know how I did it but I’m so, so proud that I managed to do it,” he said.

The 38-year-old is working with 16 skaters from 13 countries at Milano Cortina, seven of whom competed in one night during the men’s short programme – sometimes in immediate succession, requiring rapid changes of allegiance and attire. His costume swaps are coordinated behind the scenes, with jackets stored in dressing rooms or held by team staff to ensure he reaches each skater in time and is ready in the proper team colours at the “kiss-and-cry”, which is well equipped with conveniently placed Puffs tissues, a sponsor for US figure skating, for happy or sad tears.Richaud has choreographed routines inspired by Vincent van Gogh and Henri Matisse, and sees his role as a form of storytelling. “I will not be satisfied if my work as a choreographer will be only to do choreography,” he said. “I always try to bring stories. I always try to make people feel an emotion.” Coaching multiple Olympic hopefuls is, perhaps, as demanding as competing – only multiplied 16-fold.View image in fullscreenBenoît Richaud with Georgia’s Nika Egadze (left) and Maxim Naumov of the United States.Composite: Reuters; Aflo/Shutterstock3The moonwalker of MilanOne of curling’s latest viral stars is not an athlete, but the man behind the making of the ice. Mark Callan, the head ice technician at Milano Cortina, has captured global attention with the moonwalk-like step he performs while “pebbling” the surface, earning the Glaswegian the nickname “the Michael Jackson of curling”. “The viral thing has been a bit of a surprise,” Callan said.“Everybody has a different style of pebbling, bit like driving a car. I find that doing the moonwalk – or the shuffle, if you like – it keeps me stable.” Beyond the internet fame lies meticulous craftsmanship. Using purified Dolomite water, Callan and his team layer and texture each sheet to create the tiny frozen bumps that allow stones to curl, monitoring temperature, humidity and frost with scientific precision. The work is relentless, stretching to 17-hour days throughout the Games.View image in fullscreenThe curling technician Mark Callan performs his style of pebbling ahead of the men’s round robin matches.Photograph: Al Bello/Getty Images4Banned wax stops Korean skiersThe Korea Ski Association was left “perplexed” after two of its cross-country skiers were disqualified from the women’s sprint classic. Han Dasom and Lee Eui-jin had their qualifying times voided when their skis tested positive for fluorinated wax, a substance banned by the International Ski and Snowboard Federation since 2019. The Japanese snowboarder Shiba Masaki was also removed from the men’s parallel giant slalom for the same reason.The non-biodegradable wax, commonly known as fluor, had been used in skiing since the 1980s to help with glide but was banned by the FIS because of the damage it does to the environment and the potential risk to technicians applying the substance in unventilated areas.“The athletes’ products are not fluorine wax,” said a representative from the Korean association. “They tested negative in all previous international competitions with no prior issues. We are also perplexed.” In any case, neither Han nor Lee posted a time quick enough to qualify for the final.View image in fullscreenLee Eui-jin had a qualifying time voided.Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty Images5The well-trodden rollerblading pathErin Jackson of the USA wowed followers of the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang after she qualified for the 500m in the speed skating after only four months of gaining experience on ice. Her transition into the sport was made easy by her experience of inline skating and roller derby. She finished sixth in the 1,000m final on Monday and sets out to defend her 2022 Olympic title in the 500m on Sunday.Others to follow in her footsteps in these Games include Singapore’s giant slalom skier Faiz Basha, who grew up in Switzerland but had to mimic skiing on rollerblades when he could not train on snow during his mandatory military service in the country of his parents, and Daniel Milagros, who has become Spain’s first Olympic speed skater and finished second in the one-lap sprint at the world inline skating championships in 2023. Milagros came last in the men’s 1,000m in Milan but his compatriot and fellow rollerblader Nil Llop, a Winter Olympic medallist at youth level, goes in the 500m on Saturday.View image in fullscreenErin Jackson of the United States competes in the women’s 1,000m speedskating.Photograph: Luca Bruno/AP6Fans scramble for pins and toy stoatsThere is one sport in Italy that is not handing out medals but that does not mean competitors go home empty handed. Throughout the Games, residents and visitors in Milan have been setting off each morning on a race to grab limited edition Olympic pins. An Instagram post at 8am every day tells people – “walk, don’t run” – which of the city’s seven neighbourhoods or five landmarks to head to, where the tourism promoter YesMilano gives out 250 pins. Once they’re gone, they’re gone.Official Olympic merchandise, a lot of which has sold out already, is hot property despite its often extortionate pricing. Perhaps the best chance of nabbing a soft toy of the stoat mascot Tina (selling for €18 to €58; £15-£50) is to actually win a medal – the athletes are given one on the podium. Tommaso, the two-year-old son of Italy’s speed-skating star Francesca Lollobrigida,was more interested in Tinathan his mother’s gold medal.View image in fullscreenPin trading at the Olympics is a longstanding tradition where athletes, officials and fans exchange collectible pinsPhotograph: Maja Hitij/Getty Images7Like mother, like sonFew Olympic stories capture the generational spirit of sport quite like that of the Mexican alpine skier Sarah Schleper and her son, Lasse Gaxiola. Days before her 47th birthday, Schleper became the oldest woman to compete in Olympic alpine skiing when she raced in the super-G in her seventh Winter Games appearance. Across the Alps in Bormio, the 18-year-old Gaxiola is preparing for his Olympic debut in the men’s slalom, making them the first mother-son duo to compete at the sameWinter Olympics.“For him, everything’s new,” Schleper said. “And for me, I know it.” Their shared presence is the culmination of a lifetime in the sport: Schleper debuted in 1998 and competed for the United States, briefly retired, then switched allegiances to Mexico, while Gaxiola grew up on skis and earned his place through junior competition success. “For me, success is simply the fact that we are both here,” Schleper said.View image in fullscreenSarah Schleper holds her son Lasse in a December 2011 World Cup slalom event in Austria.Photograph: Armando Trovati/AP8Brazil bobsleigher’s big book bidBrazil’s Edson Bindilatti embodies perseverance in a sport far removed from his nation’s tropical roots. A veteran of six Winter Olympics, spanning Salt Lake 2002 to Milano Cortina 2026, the 46-year-old has competed as a push athlete, brakeman and pilot, achieving Brazil’s best Olympic bobsleigh finish with 20th place in the four-man event in Beijing and a historic 13th at the world championships in 2025.Inspired by Cool Runnings, the film loosely based on the debut of the Jamaican national bobsleigh team, Bindilatti endured financial hardship, long journeys, personal loss and pandemic-era training improvisations to sustain a career now stretching beyond two decades. “It would make a big book, 500 pages or more, if I were to tell all the stories,” he said in 2014.

Last November, the International Olympic Committee edged closer to implementing a ban on transgender women competing in the female category in time for the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.The 23-year-old Lundholm was born female and now identifies as a man but has not undergone any gender-affirming treatment or surgery. While this proposed ban will affect other transgender athletes, Lundholm would still be able to compete in the women’s category because it is the same gender he was assigned at birth. “I want everyone to be able to compete fairly against each other,” he said after finishing his run down the Livigno course.View image in fullscreenElis Lundholm at a women’s freestyle skiing moguls training session.Photograph: Vegard Grøtt/Bildbyrån/Shutterstock10The end of snow?While the action on snow continues to enthral, a pressing question lingers in the background: will there come a point when there is no snow left to compete on? Climate change is increasingly reshaping the Winter Olympics, as declining snowfall and rising temperatures cast doubt over how and where the Games can be staged in decades to come. Before the Games several athletes signed a petition urging the IOC to end sponsorships with fossil fuel companies. The Italian oil company Eni is one of this year’s sponsors.“I’m not that old but I’m old enough to see changes in where I’ve skied in my life,” said the American Alex Hall after winning silver in freeski slopestyle. “We’ve had events cancelled because of a lack of snow. I’ve seen first-hand the effects. I know it’s not easy for an athlete to say, because we travel a lot and do things that don’t help the situation, so it’s a mixed emotion. If we can trend towards a better future, that’s the plan, that’s the hope.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At nine o’clock on Friday night Matt Weston, the man his teammates call “Captain 110%”, became the first British man ever to win the gold in the men’s skeleton, after four faultless races across the two days of competition.The 28-year-old broke the track record at the Cortina Sliding Centre four times in succession, and won in a combined time of 3min 43.33sec, which was almost a full second ahead of the runner-up, Germany’s Axel Jungk. “I’ve been fortunate enough to win world championships, and European championships and other things, and this blows them all out the water,” Weston said. “I almost feel numb. I keep touching this medal to make sure it is real.”Winter Olympics 2026: Weston chases skeleton gold for GB, Heraskevych’s appeal rejected by Cas – liveRead moreHe is getting married in July, “but for the next few months at least I can say yes, this is the happiest day of my life, then I will have to change my answer”.Weston’s medal means Great Britain is now the most successful Olympic nation in this curious sport, which was invented by Englishmen looking for something new to do on their holidays in St Moritz in the 1920s. The country has now won four gold, one silver and five bronze medals altogether. Eight of those have come this century, after the UK started pumping in money in the early 2000s, when they built the beginnings of a practice track at the University of Bath.Weston, and his teammate Marcus Wyatt, who finished ninth, have had the benefit of the best coaching and technical support in the sport. It shows, even if it’s hard to see on TV. “If it looks like I am lying there doing nothing it means I am doing everything right,” Weston said before coming out to these Olympics. During them, the clock told you everything you needed to know.View image in fullscreenMatt Weston’s mum, Alison, his fiancee, Alex, and his dad, Tom, watch at the skeleton track in Cortina d’Ampezzo.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianHis body may be moving at 80mph, but his mind’s working in slow motion as he shifts his weight to make the minuscule adjustments he needs to stay on the right line around every bend. He is moving so fast that a lot of this is done subconsciously. He has a map of the track in his mind, but he relies on his proprioception, the body’s innate ability to sense its own position and movement, to feel his way down around it.Weston, Britain’s first male individual gold medallist in the Winter Games since Robin Cousins in 1980, says it is a skill he first learned competing in martial arts. When he was a kid, Weston was ranked second in the world in taekwondo. He won a silver at the Under-17 World Cup in 2012. If you’d asked him then, he would have told you he saw himself competing in taekwondo at the Grand Palais during the Summer Olympics in Paris two years ago. But he had to give up the sport when he fractured his back in a training accident. He played county level rugby for a few years on the wing, too. He is, you guess, one of those people who was always going to be an athlete of one sort or another.But it was only when he discovered skeleton racing through a talent ID programme that he found his calling. “I distinctly remember the first time I tried it,” Weston said, “and for the first 10 metres I was thinking, ‘I’ve got no brakes so I’m going to the bottom whether I like it or not’. It was terrifying but as soon as I finished I wanted to go back and do it over again. I had the bug.”View image in fullscreenMarcus Wyatt of Britain finished in ninth after his four runs.Photograph: Annegret Hilse/ReutersWeston has spent a decade chasing after the perfect race. “It’s so hard to describe,” he said, “we work on such fine margins that it is so hard to be perfect, it’s like floating, it’s so smooth it’s almost calming, everything fits, everything clicks, like doing a jigsaw puzzle and picking up the right piece every single time.” It’s hard to believe he will ever come closer to it than he did here in Cortina. “I’m still hunting,” he says, “but at the moment this feels as close as it can get.”Weston will race again in the mixed team event on Sunday, in which he will be paired with the fastest of the three British athletes competing in the final races of the women’s event on Saturday. That looks likely to be Tabby Stoecker, who was in fifth place after the first two heats of the competition.She had been third after the first run, but made a bad mistake coming into the second half of the course. It left her half a second behind the leader. “I think I just need a good meal, a good sleep, some analysing with my coaches, and then to come back tomorrow,” said Stoecker, “because it’s definitely not over.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsTeam GBnewsShareReuse this content"

It began in Seoul 1988 to raise awareness among athletes and young people about sexually transmitted disease prevention— a topic that shouldn’t cause embarrassment.”Fontana also shared a Instagram post by the Spanish figure skater Olivia Smart, in which she showed her followers condoms stamped with the yellow Lombardy Region logo. “I found them,” she says in the clip, which has gone viral. “They have everything you need.”There are plenty of other activities to keep athletes busy in the Olympic village, including a large gym, table football and air hockey games and even a piano. There are also free drinks machines, stacked with Coca-Cola and Innocent smoothies.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Rich Ruohonen, from Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, stepped on to the ice. He hurled the corner guard and watched his stone, biting his lip until it arrived safely at the left flank of the house.“Yeah, baby! Good shot, Rich!” skip Danny Casper – who was born in 2001, making him 30 years younger than Ruohonen – shouted across the ice.Pride and unease: US Winter Olympians navigate politics, patriotism and Trump attacksRead moreUS fans gave a standing ovation. The lawyer looked wistful. He’d just become the oldest person to compete for the US at theWinter Olympics.“I would have rather done it when we were up 8-2 instead of down 8-2,” he said, “but I really appreciate the guys giving me a chance.”A two-time national champion, Ruohonen competed at two world championships but never reached the Olympics until this year. Since he was invited to the Gen-Z US team as an alternate for Casper, who has Guillain-Barrésyndrome, Ruohonen has become something of an honorary uncle: driving his younger teammates around, waking them up for morning trainings and buying them snacks.All while holding that much-discussed full-time job.“We got Rich. Uh, he’s a lawyer. I don’t know if you guys knew that,” said Casper at a recent news conference, after that fact had already been mentioned four times. Curlers from the US women’s and men’s teams cracked up.View image in fullscreenRich Ruohonen (in hat) is considered to be an honorary uncle to his younger teammates on the US curling squad.Photograph: Fatima Shbair/AP“If you need a lawyer, I think you can call Rich,” Casper said a few minutes later, again to uproarious laughter.Jokes aside, it’s a serious commitment.“I get up three days a week at 5 in the morning, leave my house by 5:15 in the morning, go drive 30 miles to work out and train,” Ruohonen told the Associated Press.He then heads to his law practice and works all day before returning at 6pm before heading to practice again. He spends Thursday through Sunday away at curling tournaments, toting around a collared shirt and a tie so he can handle hearings on Zoom from the road. He has two kids with his wife Sherri: Nicholas, 21, and Hannah, 24. He has taught them to curl – as his father taught him – but says Nick prefers hockey.Earlier this week, Ruohonen, who was born in Saint Paul, made headlines for speaking about the recentUS Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raidsin his home state.“I’m proud to be here to represent Team USA and to represent our country. But we’d be remiss if we didn’t at least mention what’s going on in Minnesota and what a tough time it’s been for everybody,” he said in a Tuesday news conference. “This stuff is happening right, right around where we live.“This stuff is happening right around where we live. And I am a lawyer, as you know. We have a constitution. It allows us freedom of the press, freedom of speech, protects us from unreasonable searches and seizures, and makes it so we have to have probable cause to be pulled over. And what’s happening in Minnesota is wrong. There’s no shades of gray.”’Six of the 11 members of the US Olympic curling team are from Minnesota, where two people were killed over the past three months duringan immigration crackdownthat brought more than 3,000 federal agents into the state.Why James Rodríguez signed in Minnesota amid a federal occupationRead more“I really love what’s been happening there now with people coming out, showing the love, the compassion, integrity and respect for others that they don’t know and helping them out,” Ruohonen continued.“We love Minnesota for that. And I want to make it clear that we’re out here, we love our country. We’re playing for the US, we’re playing for Team USA, and we’re playing for each other, and we’re playing for our friends and family that’s sacrificed so much to get here today.“That doesn’t change anything because what the Olympics means is excellence, respect, friendship. And we all, I think, exemplify that. We are playing for the people of Minnesota and the people around the country who share those same values.”Though Ruohonen’s younger teammates poke fun and make him the butt of the occasional TikTok video, there’s clearly a lot of love on both sides.It’s because of them that Ruohonen finally got his Olympic moment after falling just short on several occasions. And it’s because of Ruohonen that the team has a mentor and a connection to the older generation of the sport, some of whom they defeated to clinch their Olympic qualification.“I came from the days when guys were smoking cigarettes out on the ice and all we did was throw rocks and think that we could be better,” Ruohonen said while praising his teammates’ work ethic.“Look at these guys,” he added. “Every one of them’s ripped. And every one of them sweeps their butt off.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026US sportsWinter OlympicsCurlingUSA Olympic teamMinnesotanewsShareReuse this content"

So is our nation,” Johnson wrote on X.She added that the Dallas Cowboys owner, Jerry Jones, personally told Newton of the news.Klecko, 72, was sentenced to three months in jail in 1993 for lying to a federal grand jury about an auto-insurance fraud scam in which he took part. He was a two-time All-Pro defensive lineman with the New York Jets from 1977 to 1988. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2023.The 64-year-old Newton, a two-time All-Pro and three-time Super Bowl champion offensive lineman with the 1990s Cowboys, was sentenced to 30 months in prison in 2002 after he was arrested with 175lb of marijuana in the trunk of his car near Dallas.Lewis, 46, pleaded guilty in 2004 to using a cellphone to try to set up a drug deal and was sentenced to four months. He played running back for the Baltimore Ravens and Cleveland Browns in his 10-year career. He ran for 10,607 yards and 58 touchdowns. His best season came in 2003, when he rushed for 2,066 yards and scored 14 touchdowns. He was Offensive Player of the Year that season and made All-Pro and the Pro Bowl for the only time in his career.Henry played running back for the Buffalo Bills, Tennessee Titans and Denver Broncos from 2001 to 2007. He posted back-to-back seasons with more than 1,350 yards with the Bills in 2002 and 2003. The 47-year-old received a three-year prison sentence in 2009 for financing an interstate drug ring.Cannon served three years of a five-year sentence beginning in 1983 for taking part in a counterfeit-money-printing operation. A two-time All-Pro and three-time AFL champion, Cannon was perhaps best known for his days starring at half back at LSU in the late 1950s. He won the Heisman Trophy in 1959.

But some small mountains are still down-to-earthJanie OsborneFri 13 Feb 2026 10.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleOnce upon a time, in the snowy mountains of remote south-westMontana, there was a thing called “five-dollar day”.Even then, $5 bought something rare: a full day ofskiing. The deal was tempting enough to inspire my friends and me to drive 44 miles (70km) from Bozeman along a narrow, winding highway – toward what would emerge as one of the most expansive and epic ski locales in the US: Big Sky Resort.View image in fullscreenAn early morning rush hour on the road leading to the Bridger Bowl ski area near Bozeman, Montana, on 27 January 2023.If you want to ski the same slopes this weekend, it would cost you $285 (though prices change regularly because of the resort’s “dynamic pricing” model). Prices at other resorts across the US have similar astronomical prices. A ski pass in Vail, Colorado, this weekend would set you back $338 and one in Park City, Utah, $333.This, of course, does not include transportation, equipment rentals, lodging, lessons, parking and on-mountain meals and beverages.All this is to say that, in the last decades, skiing in most of the Rockies has fractured into vastly different worlds. To understand how that evolved, you have to look not just at prices – but also at skiing culture.Showdown,Montana, is located in the tiny community of Neihart, and is the oldest continually operating ski area in the state. It’s a small 640-acre (260-hectare) gem with three chair lifts, a learning conveyor and a hometown vibe. The day lift ticket rate is $70.View image in fullscreenA view of the Hoxter Express lift at Showdown Montana ski hill.When George Willett and Ted Cogswell purchased the ski area in 1973, adult lift tickets cost between $4.50 and $5 a day.“When I started, I skied in blue jeans and a sweatshirt and other people did too,” says Willett, who with his wife, Margie, has experienced a wealth of ski hill history over the years. “Now, you see one guy out of 500 with blue jeans on.”Back then, Showdown’s customer base was largely working class. “Most of the people went to work every day,” he said. “And so I think the rate was commensurate with what people could pay.”View image in fullscreenSkiers at Showdown Montana in Neihart.Photograph: The GuardianWillett remembers slim years for snow and finances – and naturally, both at the same time. These were times when staff moved snow from forested areas and the parking lot with toboggans to patch over bare terrain on the ski hill – a practice known as “snow harvesting”.Asked what turned skiing into the expensive sport it is today, Willett says: “It really wasn’t a turning point. It was a gradual progression – all through technology. The equipment got better. Boots got better. Bindings got less risky.”Technology, while improving skier safety and performance, has also led to advancements in resort operations. Both have reshaped who can afford to participate.View image in fullscreenCowboy boots exchanged for rental boots in the equipment rental shop at Showdown Montana in Neihart, on 22 January.Today, Showdown is owned and operated by Willett’s family with his daughter Katie Boedecker at the helm. Snow harvesting is something most ski hills do at some point, says Boedecker. But acquiring snow-making equipment isn’t always an option for everyone.Sometimes it’s not an option because of cost. And sometimes it’s not an option because of the complexity of acquiring water rights, or because the terrain isn’t conducive to underground infrastructure.But, perhaps most relevant to the skiing consumer, all of this technology can affect ticket prices.View image in fullscreenSkiers in front of the main lodge at Showdown Montana, in Neihart, Montana, on 17 January.“The majority of us need a place that is not too expensive but can afford to keep the lights on,” says Willett.And keeping the lights on is important because “skiing is the most fun you can have with your clothes on”, says Willett. “Just remember that.”Avery Patrick, Willett’s granddaughter, also has ownership in Showdown and helps operate the place. She says that they had their best season last year ever with 75,000 skier visits, and that day lift pass rates go up about $2–$5 annually to keep up with the costs.View image in fullscreenThe dining area in the main lodge at Showdown Montana in Neihart, on 22 January.I ask her why french fries in the cafeteria cost $9, and her answer speaks to the trade-offs that many ski hills make to stay in business: charging more for discretionary items like french fries keeps ski pass rates affordable.As an alternative to the expensive cafeteria food, people are welcome to bring their own lunches. They can eat wherever they want and “make themselves at home” with one exception: “We did have to finally outlaw crockpots. People used to bring crockpots. It was a thing.”In the cafeteria, I spotted a sign: “FREE OATMEAL. ALL DAY, EVERYDAY. MADE WITH LOVE.”View image in fullscreenFree oatmeal sign in Neihart, Montana, 8 February.“We put as much love as we can into that oatmeal because we appreciate our guests and we appreciate them spending their hard-earned dollars up here,” says Boedecker.At Showdown, affordability isn’t just a pricing strategy, it’s a culture. Rituals that Boedecker has implemented, such as the Tunnel of Love – in which staff stand by the exit at the end of the day and thank guests for coming – speak to her compassionate management style.Willett’s ethos echoes Boedecker’s, and while he sees the benefits of gaining outside investors, he also understands that small ski hills risk losing their “humanness” when corporations get involved. “There’s some good ideas and some bad ideas,” he says.In Montana, it’s nearly impossible to talk about skiing without Big Sky Resort entering the conversation. Founded in 1973 by Chet Huntley of NBC’s evening news and now owned by Boyne Resorts, Big Sky spans 5,850 acres, with 40 lifts and 300 trails – making it the third-largest ski resort in North America.View image in fullscreenThe Summit Hotel at Big Sky Resort in Big Sky, Montana, on 6 February 2022.Today the culture surrounding Big Sky Resort is defined by hotels such as the One and Only, where rooms can run as high as $2,500 a night, and by the Yellowstone Club, whose members include Mark Zuckerberg and Melinda French Gates.Big Sky is an outlier in low-key Montana, and some reactions to it reflect that: “Bozeman and Big Sky have become a wealthy person’s playground,” says longtime Bozeman local Mike Kasic.Brad Niva, CEO of the Big Sky Chamber says it plainly: “Big Sky wouldn’t be Big Sky if we didn’t have Big Sky Resort.”View image in fullscreenVista Hall, a food hall at the main base of Big Sky Resort in Big Sky, Montana, on 6 February 2022.Jim Anderson is a former ski school director at Showdown. And, for the last 25 years, he has worked as a part-time PSIA (Professional Ski Instructors of America) trainer and private lesson teacher at Big Sky Resort.He sees the consequences of growth clearly, saying: “If any locals don’t like Big Sky, I think it’s because it has become so expensive and crowded, it’s kind of priced them out of skiing there. It’s their home mountain and now they can’t afford to ski there anymore.”View image in fullscreenA Big Sky Resort employee in Big Sky, Montana, on 8 February 2022.In that sense, Big Sky embodies the central contradiction of modern skiing: the better it gets, the fewer people can afford to experience it.Still, Anderson loves the skiing itself: “Some of the skiing there is as raw and real as you can find in the United States. With their high-speed lifts, I can ski an unbelievable amount of vertical in one day. It’s a skier’s mountain.”For committed skiers like Anderson who appreciate premier slopes, the cost of the daily lift ticket can be quickly reduced by purchasing any one of a number of season passes at ski hills around the state.For the more casual skier, there are myriad deals and discounts: early bird, bundled, buddy, beginner, business, tribal, military, veteran, senior, super-senior, kids, college, family and employee.At Showdown, I meet Heather Nack-Culbreth, 50, enjoying a home-packed lunch at Top Rock warming hut. Nack-Culbreth discovered her love of skiing at the age of seven at Bridger Bowl through Ski PE, a program offered by Montana schools and hosted by local mountains that provide kids with deep discounts on lessons, rentals and lift passes.View image in fullscreenKids unload from a school bus in the Showdown Montana ski area parking lot in Neihart, on 22 January.Her parents chaperoned her PE class. “That way they got to ski too,” she says. “Even then, in rural Montana, it was an expensive sport.”“Different people prioritize different activities in their lives,” says Nack-Culbreth, who doesn’t ski at expensive resorts. “Maybe we don’t take a crazy trip. Maybe we don’t make purchases that other people make. We choose skiing.”Explore more on these topicsSkiingMontanaClass issuesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the arraignment, Diggs was scheduled to next appear for a pretrial hearing on 1 April.According to court records, the chef told Dedham officers she and Diggs argued about money he owed her for her work. During the 2 December encounter at his home, she said, he “smacked her across the face” and then “tried to choke her using the crook of his elbow around her neck”, leaving her feeling short of breath.Diggs’s arraignment was originally slated for 23 January but was moved to 13 February – five days after thePatriots’ 29-13 lossto the Seattle Seahawks.Diggs’s attorney has said he “categorically denies these allegations”, calling them unsubstantiated and motivated by a financial dispute. The Patriots released a statement saying they support him.Investigators allege the woman first reported the incident to police on 16 December, two weeks after it occurred; she initially hesitated to file charges but later chose to do so, according to court documents.The arraignment Friday was the first court appearance in the case. The judge was expected to address bail conditions and set future hearing dates.Diggs, 32, spent the first part of his NFL career with the Minnesota Vikings and the Buffalo Bills. He had six consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons and earned four Pro Bowl selections.After a short stint in Houston, Diggs signed with the Patriots last March on a three-year, $69m deal. He finished this season with 1,013 receiving yards and four touchdowns and played in all four of New England’s playoff games.Explore more on these topicsNew England PatriotsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

But his happy association with Hull continued with a magnificent display from hisChelseaside, who ultimately sauntered into the next round of the FA Cup.Hull City 0-4 Chelsea: FA Cup fourth round – liveRead moreThere was much to admire about this performance. Three days removed from surrenderinga two-goal lead against Leeds, it felt as though there was a sniff of vulnerability about Chelsea going into this intriguing tie. The capacity home crowd clearly felt it too given the atmosphere pre-match – but Chelsea navigated the task perfectly.Rosenior rang the changes, making seven of them to his starting lineup: with one in particular taking centre stage. The tie could and perhaps should have been decided long before it actually was, with both Estêvão Willian and Liam Delap guilty of spurning glorious opportunities to put Chelsea ahead in the first half.Quick GuideParkinson savours another Wrexham milestoneShowPhil Parkinson wanted to savour the moment after guiding Wrexham into the FA Cup fifth round for the first time in 29 years.John Windass scored the winner as they edged a tight contest against their Championship promotion rivals Ipswich 1-0 at the Racecourse Ground.It was another notable victory for the ambitious Welsh side as their rise under the ownership of the Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney continues.Parkinson said: \"We spoke before the game about our chance to create a bit of history. We've done it and I'm so pleased because it was always going to be a tough game against a very good side.\"Every season in football is special and you've got to savour it. This season, with the challenge of being in the Championship and now an FA Cup run, we want to enjoy it, and tonight we certainly did.\"PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.But fortunately for the visitors, Pedro Neto was in a much more clinical mood. The Portuguese broke the deadlock with a marvellous long-range strike which proved to be the catalyst for Chelsea to assume control of proceedings and by full time, Rosenior’s men had four, with Neto scoring three of them for a superb hat-trick.That made for an ultimately straightforward evening’s work, and the FA Cup-shaped omens are good from here for Chelsea. They have faced Hull on three other occasions in this competition in the last decade and every single time, they have gone on to make the final. There is still work to do in that regard, but this was another huge tick for Rosenior.View image in fullscreenLiam Rosenior gestures towards his much-changed Chelsea team.Photograph: Andrew Kearns/CameraSport/Getty Images“We could have scored more but Hull are a good team and it was a difficult tie; I’m delighted with the performance,” he said. “This club [Hull] means a lot to me so it was nice to get a good reception from both sets of fans. The attitude of the lads was superb.”Hull showed plenty of spirit throughout, but the better chances always came Chelsea’s way. Estêvão should have broken the deadlock when he rounded Dillon Phillips before inexplicably shooting over, before Delap then had a similar horror moment in front of goal against his former club.He blocked a Phillips clearance which bounced off the crossbar, and Delap began to run away to celebrate thinking the ball had crossed the line. It hadn’t, and by the time he realised Hull’s defenders had responded to clear the danger.Delap had his head in his hands after that horror moment but he was hugely influential from there on out, with three assists. The first was for the opening goal as his pass teed up Neto to score from outside the box and give the visitors a deserved lead. Six minutes after the restart, it was two as Neto’s corner went directly in and through Phillips’s legs.View image in fullscreenEstêvão slots in Chelsea’s third goal.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersBy that stage, the work Hull had done in the opening half-hour had long since been forgotten. They were firmly in the contest in the early exchanges but it was difficult to argue with the final outcome, and their focus must now return to securing a return to the Premier League under Sergej Jakirovic, who left out several key players here with that goal in mind.“I think we deserved at least one goal but if we play like this we will be in a very good position in the Championship,” he said post-match. “Never surrender, maybe in the next games this can be a good example of how we should play.”Seven minutes after Neto’s second, the tie was put beyond doubt as a magnificent run from Delap teed up Estêvão to tap into an empty net, before Neto completed his hat-trick as Delap once again played the crucial pass for the striker to calmly convert past a helpless Phillips and put the seal on a fine night’s work for him and his teammates.There was plenty of endeavour to the end from Hull, and they almost claimed a consolation when Lewis Koumas struck a post in injury time. But this was Chelsea’s night, and another encouraging step forward for their new manager at a place he knows very well.Explore more on these topicsFA CupHull CityChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The former Croatia international has been out of work since he left Juventus in October after the Serie A club went eight games without a win.Bring on the old guard to beat the drop: can Ange’s recall be right twist for Spurs? | Max RushdenRead moreSpurs, who are in a fight to stay in the Premier League after a dismal run, have been working through their list of candidates sincesacking Thomas Frankon Wednesday. They did not want to commit to a long-term appointment and looked for a short-term hire capable of making an instant impact. It is felt that Tudor’s record fits the bill. The former Juventus defender has had spells at Hajduk Split, Paok, Karabukspor, Galatasaray, Udinese, Verona and Marseille, as well as an 11-game stint with Lazio.The desire to bring in an interim will be interpreted as Spurs looking to keep the position open for Pochettino should their former manager indicate he is ready for an emotional reunion. Pochettino, who had five excellent years in N17 before his dismissal in November 2019, is off the market because he will take charge of the USA at this summer’s World Cup. But the Argentinian could be available after the tournament and has flirted with the idea of resuming his relationship with Spurs on multiple occasions. He remains a fan favourite and had his name chanted during Frank’s final game – the2-1 home defeat by Newcastleon Tuesday. It seems that Pochettino managing Chelsea during the 2023-24 season will not be held against him by Spurs supporters.View image in fullscreenMauricio Pochettino will take charge of the USA at this summer’s World Cup.Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty ImagesThere are no guarantees and Spurs will need a shortlist. The desire to bring in an interim ruled out Roberto De Zerbi – the Italian wants a break after leaving Marseille this week – but the former Brighton manager will be a candidate this summer. Spurs have also been linked with Bournemouth’s Andoni Iraola, Crystal Palace’s Oliver Glasner and Fulham’s Marco Silva.Tudor will have a shot at earning the job on a permanent basis if he proves a success. The 47-year-old’s task is to lift Spurs away from danger. They are five points above the bottom three before they host Arsenal in Tudor’s first game next Sunday. The first-team squad have been given until Monday off, with Spurs not in action this weekend after theirFA Cup exitlast month, but their new manager will be in place when they return.Spurs will hope that Tudor can lift the mood in the dressing room and calm the unrest in the stands. Frank struggled to win over supporters and players before leaving after eight months. The atmosphere at home games has been mutinous.ProfileIgor TudorShowPlaying daysAn imposing centre-back, Tudor broke through at hometown club Hajduk Split before joining Juventus in 1998. He spent nine years in Turin, winning two Serie A titles before returning to Hajduk. Tudor also won 55 Croatia caps, playing at the 1998 and 2006 World Cups and scoring against England at Euro 2004.Early managerial careerTudor's first managerial job came at Hajduk, winning the Croatian Cup in 2013. He lasted just nine months at Greek side Paok before being sacked due to \"unsuccessful results and criticism of the team\". After a year at Karabukspor, Tudor moved to Galatasaray but was sacked after 10 months, having struggled in Europe and fallen out with star player Wesley Sneijder.Return to ItalyTudor was named head coach of Udinese in April 2018 and saved the club from relegation. He left in the summer, but returned to Friuli in March 2019.  Tudor rejoined Hadjuk in January 2020 but after just eight months he was back in Italy, joining Juventus as Andrea Pirlo's assistant. The pair won the 2021 Coppa Italia but failed to regain the title and were dismissed. \"I think it was unfair,\" Tudor said. \"I've decided I will no longer work as an assistant for anybody else.\"Season in Verona and Marseille moveTudor was hired by Verona in September 2021 after they started the season with three league defeats. He improved things quickly, guiding them to a ninth-placed finish – but again leaving at the end of the season. Tudor's next job came at Marseille, where he replaced Jorge Sampaoli. The team finished third in Ligue 1 but flopped in the Champions League, losing twice to Tottenham. He announced his exit in June after \"a great year\", saying he was \"tired\" of managing Marseille.Lazio stint and return to JuventusTudor waited nine months for his next job, which came at Lazio after Maurizio Sarri resigned. After winning six of his 11 games in charge and sealing a Europa League spot, Tudor walked away after reported disputes with the club hierarchy over transfer targets. Having previously been linked with a return to Juventus, Tudor replaced Thiago Motta in March 2025, guiding the club to fourth place. He signed a contract extension until 2028, but was sacked in October after an eight-game winless run.Guardian sportWin percentages by clubHadjuk Split(first stint) 44.9%Paok37.78%Karabukspor38.1%Galatasaray55.9%Udinese(combined) 42.3%Hadjuk Split(second stint) 50.0%Verona38.9%Marseille56.3%Lazio54.6%Juventus41.7%Photograph: Jamie, Mcdonald/02 ALLSPORT UKWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Tudor will have to deal with a huge injury list. Frank, who left after a run of two wins from 17 league games, could not call upon the injured James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski this season. Mohammed Kudus and Richarlison are other notable absentees in attack and Wilson Odobert sustained a serious knee injury this week. Cristian Romero, the captain, hasspoken out against the Spurs hierarchyand is serving a four-game ban after his red card during last weekend’s 2-0 defeat at Manchester United.Discussions with Tudor moved swiftly.

Liverpool’s central-defensive rebuild is under way with the signings of Giovanni Leoniand Jérémy Jacquet, for an initial £26m and £55m respectively, but Slot insists Konaté remains an essential part of his plans.FA Cup fourth round: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead more“It’s just as good from him as from Virgil [van Dijk],” said Liverpool’s head coach of Konaté’s current form. “Ibou has had a very good spell recently. He had a lot of good games earlier in the season but then he was also part of the reason why we conceded a goal.“His general performances were good but then a small mistake he made immediately led to a goal and so he was judged differently. But he is having a very good partnership with Virgil since I’ve been here and, just like Virgil, he has always been fit. Touch wood. These two are vital for us, not only because of the quality they have but because of the lack of options we have behind.”Afterscoring the winner at Sunderlandon Wednesday, Van Dijk said he wanted Liverpool to secure his defensive colleague on a new contract. Konaté’s current deal expires at the end of the season and the 26-year-old has been linked with a free transfer to Real Madrid.Liverpool have been trying to secure the France international’sfuture for more than 12 months but, despite failing to agree fresh terms, Slot claimed the club are not resigned to Konate’s exit.“We are in talks with him so that tells you what we want,” said the Dutchman. “It’s clear we would like him to stay but negotiations are ongoing so let’s see where that ends. We wouldn’t be in negotiations if we didn’t want him to stay.”Meanwhile, Slot believes Mohamed Salah should be judged at the end of the season having struggled by his phenomenal standards in front of goal. Salah has scored only once since his return from the Africa Cup of Nations – though his assists and pressing stats have improved after the tournament – and across the entire campaign he is having fewer shots per game than previous years.“There could be multiple reasons for that,” said Slot. “It could be the opponent is even more aware of his threat after such a great season last season, or having so many different right-backs behind him for the whole season has influenced that dynamic. I could come up with five or six more reasons.“What I do see is that, in general, the team generates just as many chances as we did last season. The team has the most ball possession in the league. I also see us being able to bring our forwards, and not only Mo, into very promising positions in many games. So it will be a combination of factors. Even last season Mo had a period where he scored seven in four games, I think, and then five or six games where he didn’t score, so let’s see where he is at the end of the season when it comes to goals and assists.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotnewsShareReuse this content"

But all around the world the problem that we have [is that] we treat immigrants or people who come from other countries as the problem that our countries have, and it is a big problem as it not their fault.“The fact that I am a Catalan and you are British – what influence did we have on where we were born? It was mum and dad. Everybody wants to have a better life and a perspective to have a better future for themselves, their families and their friends, and sometimes opportunities come in the place where you are born and the place that maybe you go to.“Before it was so difficult to travel but today in one hour you can be everywhere. Today the colour of the skin or where you were born doesn’t make a difference. We have a lot of work to do about that. It doesn’t make me feel that because I am Catalan I am better than you.”Guardiola went on to reference a career that, as a player, took him from Barcelona to Brescia, Roma, Al Ahli, and Dorados in Mexico, before managerial roles in Spain, Germany and England. “My education when I was born and travelled in Mexico and Qatar or lived in Italy or England or Germany, that is just the benefit [for] my personality,” said the 55-year-old. “I met incredibly nice people travelling and that is what it is about. But it doesn’t make me feel better just for the fact I was born in one place or the other one.“Most people are running away from countries because of problems in their countries, not because they want to leave. When we embrace other cultures – truly embrace them – we will have a better society.”Guardiola pointed to how City’s dressing room has and continues to benefit from a blend of different cultures. “Absolutely. How nice it is to have Christian people, other people who are Muslim and they love each other, respect each other, work with each other,” he said. “What is the problem? The problem is created by the bosses and the presidents. If you have to rely on them, we are in trouble. Civilisation we have to do ourselves. We have to rely on guys to say what we have to do, to fight?”View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola says having a diverse dressing room helps Manchester City.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPACity host Salford City in Saturday’s FA Cup fourth round. Erling Haaland is an injury doubt for the game having been replaced at half-time of Wednesday’s3-0 win over Fulham.“He’s not 100% but we will see later how he feels,” said Guardiola. “It’s not a big issue, the doctors said to me, but he had some disturbances during the game and that’s why he didn’t play in the second half.”Guardiola has twice led City to FA Cup glory and said he loves the competition. “Playing against League One or League Two teams – that experience, when you arrive at the stadium with the coach and all the opposition fans there, chanting: ‘Who are you? Who are you?’ And you say: ‘Oh gosh.’ These kind of things, the vibes and long balls, other things. Honestly, I promise you, it will be one of the memories I will take for the rest of my life.”Meanwhile, Rodri has been charged with misconduct by the Football Association over his questioning of the neutrality of the referee Robert Jones after he allowed Dominic Solanke’s first goal inCity’s 2-2 draw at Tottenhamthis month.Solanke appeared to kick Marc Guéhi in the action for his finish on 53 minutes. “I know we won too much and the people don’t want us to win, but the referee has to be neutral,”said Rodri after the game. “It’s not fair because we work so hard. When everything is finished, you are frustrated.”In a statement, the FA said: “It’s alleged that the midfielder acted in an improper manner during a post-match media interview by making comments that imply bias and/or question the integrity of a match official and/or match officials, contrary to FA Rule 3.1. Rodri has until Wednesday 18 February to provide a response.”Explore more on these topicsManchester CityPep GuardiolaJim RatcliffenewsShareReuse this content"

It culminated inplayer strikesand the Canadian Soccer Players Associationfiling a $40m lawsuitagainst Canada Soccer board members two years ago.The CSB deal was heavily criticised during a 2023 parliamentary inquiry into Canada Soccer, as the federation was only receiving around $3m each year from its commercial and broadcast deals, which severely affected funding for Canada’s national teams.Moving the Goalposts | ‘Everything is at stake’: the fight for equal pay in Canadian footballRead moreCanada’s men’s teamboycotted a friendly against Panama in 2022as they demanded a greater share of World Cup prize money, more travel benefits and equitable match fees with the women’s national team, who in recent years have been far more successful.Canada’s women’s team also struggled for funding under the previous deal, and there was a national outcry when only 20 players were invited to a training camp in preparation for the 2023 SheBelieves Cup, less than two years after they won gold at the Tokyo Olympics. The women’s team also threatened to strike, but the action was ultimately called off.Under the terms of the previous deal Canada Soccer was due to receive around $3.4m from the CBS partnership in the World Cup year, but that figure is understood to have increased significantly and a new revenue-sharing model has been introduced.In a new broadcasting deal there is a commitment to ensure that all international matches in Canada and “Canada-friendly time zones” are televised live, as well as ensuring an equity of exposure between the men’s and women’s national teams. Both parties have also agreed to review the terms every three years to ensure they continue to receive fair market value.CSB has also been rebranded as Canadian Soccer Media and Entertainment (CSME) under the leadership of James Johnson, former chief executive of Football Australia, who has negotiated the new deal with Canada Soccer’s chief executive, Kevin Blue.“We are pleased to have amended this partnership into a new structure that is significantly more favourable to Canada Soccer, creating a clear pathway for commercial and financial success – especially in future years as opportunity in our sport continues to increase,” Blue said. “We are eager to move forward in a new era of alignment with CSME and continue to be sharply focused on growing all parts of our sport at this critical time.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaCanada women's football teamnewsShareReuse this content"

It is one of the unconventional techniques he has used to convey his message and tap into their psyche. Every week he explores different themes and stories with his squad – be it bullfighting or UFC – and brings them to life through imagery and props, everything from dragons to toy tigers.He has leaned into boxing and particularly Mike Tyson during anFA Cuprun that has led them to a fourth-round tie at home to West Ham on Saturday.“The theme for this week is The Ultimate,” he says, referencing Tyson’s 1987 bout with Tony Tucker to become the undisputed heavyweight champion. “We’ve created this idea of climbing into the ring, the pitch, and away you go. We’re fighting West Ham and we’re going to have to take some blows. What do you do if you get knocked on to the canvas? Get back up or lay there and take it?”FA Cup fourth round: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreAcross an hour of conversation, after Bowyer has taken training on pitch No 11 at St George’s Park, the Football Association’s sprawling hub in Staffordshire, it seems we have only scratched the surface. Bowyer is a gregarious and engaging character.His dissertationon the process of sporting directors recruiting managers was published last year and his coaching methods are the subject of an academic research paper by Dr Matthew Smith at the University of Winchester, initiated by Bowyer’s performance coach, Chris Martin. “We talk about trying to enhance performance, establishing different themes to build emotional attachment. Some of them have been brilliant and really powerful. It has been very positive.”Burton hope to reach the last 16 of the Cup for the first time. One of the club’s greatest days came in the competition. When they were in non-league in 2006, they pocketed £800,000 from athird-round replay against Manchester Unitedthat helped pay for their Pirelli Stadium, where, until a few hours before kick-off, the pitch is likely to remain blanketed by a heated cover to combat the forecast freezing temperatures. In 2019 they reached the Carabao Cup semi-finals, though Manchester City killed the tie witha 9-0 first-leg win. Nigel Clough, whom Bowyer got to know while on the books at Forest and remains a trusted confidant, was in charge on both occasions.Bowyer learned from “genius” Brian Clough the art of simplicity and the importance of having fun. During the World Darts Championship, Burton’s squad stepped up to their in-house oche, each player selecting different fancy dress, stage names and walk-on music. Pat Lyons, Bowyer’s assistant who played for the club, opted for Del Boy. “I was the MC,” says Bowyer. “We’re a unique club and you develop a culture in different ways. We all talk about values and when I first started managing at Blackburn we blazed them all over the walls, but you’ve got to enjoy it. Sometimes it is all taken far too seriously, the reaction of fans towards managers these days … just diabolical.”View image in fullscreenThe Pirelli Stadium pitch has been covered to combat the forecast freezing temperatures before Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianHe played the theme tune from The Great Escape, one of his favourite films, to his squad in a meeting after they secured their League One status last season; with four months remaining, Burton were bottom and 11 points from safety. At one of the league’s smallest clubs, who are back in the drop zone in a tight relegation battle, Kasabian’s Underdog has been an anthem this season. “When I took the job people said: ‘What are you doing? It’s impossible, they’re relegated.’ We stayed up with a game to spare. So, anything’s possible. But I need some new material. I was quoting from Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels the other day. No, never seen it.”Bowyer recalls fond memories of watching the Cup on Grandstand as a boy. “I don’t think my dad ever got past the third round,” he says of his father, Ian, a staple of Clough Sr’s legendary Nottingham Forest side. “I remember him going to church one week. My mum went religiously but that wasn’t him. ‘Where’s Dad?’ ‘He’s gone to church.’ ‘Why?’ ‘To try and get a bit of help to get past the third round.’ I think they got beat in a replay by Newcastle … I give him a bit of stick, but obviously he trumps me by saying: ‘Well, go and have a look at my double European Cup medals.’”In recent days Bowyer has drip-fed his squad clips of Cup upsets, including AFC Wimbledon beating West Ham and Stevenage shocking Aston Villa, in which the Burton defenders Toby Sibbick and Terence Vancooten respectively featured. Bowyer stresses his players need to box clever against a side 47 places above them in the pyramid. He pauses a small-sided game. “How did that feel? Intense? Tight? It’s going to be like that on Saturday.”View image in fullscreenBurton’s small-sided game in training was designed to prepare for an intense, tight match against West Ham.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianThen it is an attack v defence drill. “There will be times you’re going to have to suffer. Did anybody watch Forest v Wolves? Just me? Forest had 35 shots and Wolves barely had a kick but could have won the game at the end on the counter.” Later he challenges the left-back Sebastian Revan and Sulyman Krubally, a 17-year-old academy youngster, to practise suffocating space on the wing in preparation for Adama Traoré.Bowyer reached the Cup quarter-finals with Blackburn in 2015,Liverpool advancing via a replayat a sold-out Ewood Park. He smiles as he recalls the third-round replay against Manchester City the previous season. “We were 3-0 down and Craig Short, one of my coaches, said: ‘Whatever you do, don’t look left,’” Bowyer says, swivelling his head. “[Manuel] Pellegrini was bringing on Sergio Agüero. Craig starts laughing: ‘I told you.’ Agüero comes on and scores straight away.”A few weeks into the job, while acknowledging St George’s Park is a world-class facility, Bowyer felt the squad would benefit from a base of their own, so now the players report to the stadium – a 15-minute drive away – before and after training for gym sessions and meetings. The session ends with set-piece routines. Krubally gathers the balls and the players share lifts back to the ground. As Bowyer poses for his portrait, he reveals he has ordered Super Bock and Sagres to make Nuno Espírito Santo feel at home post-match.View image in fullscreenIf Burton beat West Ham they will reach the last 16 of the FA Cup for the first time.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianWhen he faced Pellegrini with Blackburn, he plumped for Chilean wine. “I better take my hands out of my pockets; Brian Clough would tell you off for that,” the 54-year-old says, adjusting his stance. Then he is off to finalise tickets for his 15 family and friends who will be in attendance, including his five-year-old son, Leo, a Liverpool and Mohamed Salah superfan.When Burton’s match at Exeter in November was postponed, Bowyer scanned the fixtures and seized the chance to take Leo to his first game:Forest’s 3-0 triumph at Anfield. Bowyer sat on his hands in the home end beside his father and son as the goals went in. “I’ve tried to convince him Forest is his team, but he’s not having any of it,” he says.“My daughter and my granddaughters will also be coming and it’s brilliant because the FA Cup is about creating memories.”Explore more on these topicsBurton AlbionFA CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the start of the 2015-16 Premier League season, the bookies rated them as no better than 5,000-1 long shots to win the title, only for the Foxes to send shockwaves around the world by doing exactly that in what is regarded asone of the greatest upsets in the history of sport. Five years later, they lifted the FA Cup despite having been priced up at the comparatively miserly – but still hefty – odds of 16-1. Earlier this week they were at it again, somehow contriving to defy the laws of probability by surrendering a three-goal half-time lead at home against Southampton and snatching the most unlikely of defeats from jaws of victory that weren’t so much gaping as unhinged like that of a snake. A capitulation that came just four days after they had been docked six points forfinancial shenanigans, it left them just one place above the drop zone and staring down the barrel of back-to-back relegations to League One.A title-winning midfielder with Leicester, Andy King has been in interim charge since the sacking of Martí Cifuentes last month but insists he doesn’t want the job on a full-time basis despite his legendary status at the club. It’s just as well as he probably won’t be offered it after masterminding three successive defeats, but both Steven Gerrard and Sean Dyche have been tenuously linked with the gig. Heavy has been the head that has worn the crown at Leicester since their promotion to the Premier League in 2024. Having proved too weighty for Steve Cooper, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Cifuentes, now it seems too much of a burden even for a man named King. “It was a horrible night,” he said of his side’s surrender to Southampton, on a night when home fans told his players they’re not fit to wear the club’s shirt. “[The players] are angry, they share the frustration and they’re working hard to put it right.”Leicester’s desperation to avoid relegation to the third tier means they could almost certainly do without having to play an FA Cup match, when they could be gadding about at warm-weather training somewhere exotic like so many other third-round casualties, or even cold-weather training in Loughborough instead. Unfortunately their only win in seven games, against Cheltenham Town in the third round, means their players will be forced to try to put that aberration against Southampton behind them at the first time of asking … when they play them again on Saturday. A tie so glamorous it is one of the five of 16 that hasn’t been picked for TV coverage and, even with prices slashed, ticket sales have been predictably slow.

Rosetti made clear that he was not commenting specifically on VAR’s deployment in England but suggested that, across the board, it is guilty of overreach.“We forgot a little bit, everywhere,” he said. “Eight years ago, I came to London and we discussed what VAR stands for. We spoke about clear mistakes, because technology works so well in factual decisions. In objective decisions, it is fantastic.You may not like the Liverpool red card, but it was the right call | Jonathan WilsonRead more“Subjective evaluation is more difficult. That’s why we started to speak about clear and obvious mistakes: clear evidence. I believe that we need to speak about this again in our meetings at the end of the season. We cannot go in this direction of microscopic VAR intervention. We love football like it is.”Rosetti criticised the overuse of slow-motion replays to diagnose offences that may be relatively harmless in real time. “We call thismoviola,” he said, referring to a 1920s film-editing machine. “When you are watching the situation with the super-slow motion, you can find a lot of things.”The Premier League’s VAR intervention rate of 0.15 per match for on-field reviews – 0.27 including “factual reviews” that do not demand the referee’s interpretation – is the lowest in Europe but it is roundly accused of overly pedantic use. In the Champions League, the overall rate is 0.47.Speaking after Uefa’s annual congress in Brussels, Rosetti said media narratives had played a part in fuelling its overuse. “You said this, not me,” he said when asked whether VAR is going too far. “You are guilty in some way, because also you pushed for more interventions. ‘Where is VAR? Why doesn’t VAR intervene? Why is VAR not involved? What are the VARs doing?’ But now we need to be careful about that.”In January the International Football Association Board (Ifab), which makes the game’s laws, backed plans for VAR to intervene if necessary on the award of corners and wrongly given second yellow cards.Explore more on these topicsVideo assistant referees (VARs)RefereesFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s easy to see whyJacob SteinbergExtending his England men’s team contract until 2028 means increased stability and a less relentless form of pressureFri 13 Feb 2026 09.32 ESTLast modified on Fri 13 Feb 2026 16.11 ESTShareThomas Tuchel was supposed to be here for a good time, not a long time. It was win or bust when he signed up to become England’s head coach in October 2024. The target was clear – lead the side to glory at the 2026 World Cup – and it came with an acceptance that the German was nothing more than a very expensive gun for hire.An 18-month deal, which began on 1 January 2025, saw to that. Tuchel talked about it giving him focus. He said it streamlined the role. “It’s a little bit of a step into the unknown for me,” he said. Tuchel would have to adapt. He loves being out on the training pitch, working with his players, honing their understanding of his tactics. Wouldn’t he get bored during the long months without a game? Wouldn’t he get itchy feet as soon as he saw a job open up at a big club?This week we saw the clearest evidence yet of Tuchel’s transformation into staunch international football enthusiast, as the 52-year-old beamed for the cameras and spoke excitedly about extending his contract until Euro 2028. What changed? Was it just how bonds were tightened as England sealed World Cup qualification with a series ofstrong, unified performances between September and November? Perhaps, but it is also worth considering what else is out there. Tuchel is not English. Unlike Gareth Southgate he is not on some deep, emotional quest to heal society. He is doing a job and, taking a pragmatic view, has realised that another two years with England is a better career choice than returning to the volatility of club management.It is mid-February and already there have been bitter separations at Chelsea, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Tottenham since the turn of the year. Nottingham Forest, admittedly not the calmest club, are appointing theirfourth manager of a tumultuous season. Tuchel, meanwhile, can go serenely about his business. Yes, managing England at a tournament is stressful and demanding, particularly if performances dip for a second or two. Even so, it happens only once every two years. Club managers are on the hamster wheel constantly. There is no rest any more. The Champions League is bigger. The Club World Cup is a thing. Owners are more involved. Media duties are relentless. Sporting directors are more influential than ever but are rarely the first to carry the can for a poor run of form or a bad transfer window.View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel with Harry Kane in 2024 during his time at Bayern Munich.Photograph: Tom Weller/PAIt says a lot that a mid-career Tuchel is not in a rush to go to Manchester United. There may be vacancies at Barcelona, Liverpool, Real Madrid, Manchester City and Spurs this summer. Antonio Conte has had atough season at Napoli. Big jobs will be going around. But Tuchel is happier where he is now.He will have seenEnzo Maresca’s implosion at ChelseaandRuben Amorim’s run-in with the United politburo. Thomas Frank looked hauntedroughly two seconds after joining Spurs. Eddie Howe led Newcastle to a trophy last year but is under pressure. Xabi Alonso, the brightest young manager around, was torn to shreds andlasted less than a year at Real. Arne Slot is one of two managers to have won the Premier League at Liverpool, yet it wouldnot be a major shockif he left before the year is out.Stability is in short supply. It is not obvious which job would appeal to Tuchel. Working at United and Chelsea requires a lot of managing upwards. Spurs are a mess and Newcastle have spending restrictions. The Premier League is the place to be but few clubs seem happy. A lot of fans have grown weary. The club game feels increasingly hard and cynical. Managers are chewed up and spat out. The problem with looking away from English football is the financial inequality choking much of Europe. Many of Italy’s big clubs do not have the resources to compete in the Champions League. The idea of joining Juventus or Milan should be more attractive to a manager of Tuchel’s calibre. The reality is more sober. In Spain, there is not much beyond the two giants. Valencia, who reached Champions League finals in 2000 and2001, have fallen. Atlético remain awkward but are not as strong as they were a decade ago.It is not just La Liga. Where in France, apart from a reunion with Paris Saint-Germain? As for Germany, there is not much beyond Bayern Munich, who are unlikely to want a reunion with Tuchelafter their bitter split in 2024.There is a shift. Maresca and Amorim appeared happy to leave big jobs. Alonso needs to choose his next job carefully. Tuchel is not alone in not hankering for a club job. Other Germans have walked away. Jürgen Klopp needed a break after leaving Liverpool and is still happy on the padel court. International management was supposed to be for older coaches but Julian Nagelsmann, 38, is about to take Germany into a second tournament.It is not so hard to understand. The Football Association is only too delighted to have Tuchel. He does not have to deal with meddling owners or egotistical sporting directors. He does not have to worry about transfer budgets. Away from tournaments he does not hold press conferences every three days. Tuchel gets to breathe. Maybe he gets to read a book or watch a film. True, the vibe will change ifEnglandfalter this summer. It does not change the central point. It does not alter that sense of international football feeling purer than the club game in its current state.Part of its beauty is that it is, to a much greater extent, just about the football. Tuchel has his pick of some of the best players in the world. He coaches as he sees fit. The World Cup will be tough and intense but a home Euros is something to savour. Tuchel’s shift is not that big a surprise.Explore more on these topicsThomas TuchelEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

The last run was kind of for me, but yeah, it’s hard to look at it like that because I can’t change the result, but yeah, it is what it is.”Australia’s other competitor in the Livigno final, Valentino Guseli, also crashed twice but showed his immense talent on his last run, scoring 88.00 to finish fifth.It improved his position in the final by one spot from Beijing with the 20-year-old recovering from a ruptured ACL to compete in Italy.“Well, on the first two runs I sucked, but I landed my last one and I got one place better than I did in the last Olympics, so we’re going up, which is cool,” Guseli said.“I wanted to land that run that I did last perfectly on my first run and then keep upping it and I had some ideas of how I was going to do that.

I don’t have any regrets.”Heraskevych’s lawyer, Yevhen Pronin, reacted with disappointment to the Cas decision. “The court sided with the IOC and upheld the decision that an athlete could be disqualified from the Olympic Games without actual misconduct, without a technical or safety threat, and before the start,” Pronin wrote.“This case was much broader than an individual dispute. It concerned the freedom of expression of athletes, the limits of discretion of sports bodies, and the very understanding of Olympic values.”Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president, met with Heraskevych and said: “Remembrance is not a violation. Thank you for your stance, your strength, and your courage.“I met with Vladyslav Heraskevych and his father, coach of Ukraine’s skeleton team, Mykhailo Heraskevych. I presented Vladyslav with the order of freedom.“Ukraine will always have champions and Olympians. But above all, Ukraine’s greatest asset is Ukrainians – those who cherish the truth and the memory of the athletes killed by Russia, athletes who will never compete again because of the Russian aggression.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

The scheduled seven-race card at the Lancashire course includes two Grade Two events in addition to the £100,000 Grand National Trial over three-and-a-half miles.No inspection is currently planned at Musselburgh for the track’s card on Sunday, but a six-race meeting at Lingfield on Monday was called off early on Friday afternoon with the track already waterlogged and further rain expected.Conditions will be very different in Riyadh on Saturday evening when Forever Young, the Breeders’ Cup Classic winner, could take his career earnings past $30m (£22m) with a second successive victory in the $20m Saudi Cup, the world’s richest race.Forever Young, trained in Japan by Yoshito Yahagi, will set off as a warm favourite to beat a field that includes Bob Baffert’s Nysos, the Breeders’ Cup Dirt Mile winner in 2025, and his stable-companion Nevada Beach, who was a head behind him in a Grade Two event at Santa Anita in December.Oisin Murphy, Britain’s champion jockey, also has a ride in the race aboard Sunrise Zipangu, whose trainer, Kyoko Maekawa, was the first woman to be granted a training licence in Japan.View image in fullscreenRyusei Sakai (No 5) rode Forever Young to victory in the 2025 Breeders’ Cup Classic.Photograph: Gregory Bull/APPic D’Orhy can be Jonbon’s bogeyThe popular and supremely consistent Jonbon would become only the third horse this century to win 11 Grade One races over jumps with victory in the Ascot Chase on Saturdaythis afternoon, butPic D’Orhy(3.35), his main market rival, is also on the brink of a significant achievement and could be the better bet at a track and trip that suits him ideally.The 11-year-old will join eight former residents of the Paul Nicholls stable as the winner of more than £1m in prize money if he finishes either first or second in the five-runner field, which is all the more impressive given a preference for right-handed tracks which has seen him make only one appearance at Cheltenham, in March 2019.Pic D’Orhy needs to be forgiven a lacklustre run in the 1965 Chase over Saturday’s course and distance in November, but he has always appreciated a decent break between runs and that outing came just three weeks after a promising seasonal reappearance in the Charlie Hall at Wetherby.Saturday’s race will be his first for 84 days, and in an event that he has won for the past two seasons having set off on both occasions as the second-pick in the betting. The Nicholls stable is also in much better form in recent weeks, with 11 wins from 27 runners before racing on Friday including Tutti Quanti’s emphatic win in last weekend’s feature event.Jonbon, admittedly, promises to be a tougher opponent than either of the last two favourites, but he is racing beyond two-and-a-half miles for the first time and also had to dig deep to win the Clarence House at Ascot four weeks ago after looking beaten two out.Ascot 1.15:Mondoui’boywas a six-figure recruit to the Ben Pauling stable last summer, made a smooth transition to hurdling at Ludlow last month and will be strongly fancied to follow up here.Wincanton 1.35:The Kingwell Hurdle was won by the subsequent Champion Hurdle winner for the first time since 2008 last season, and fast-improvingAlexei, a close third under 12 stone in a hot handicap at Ascot last time, can book a place in this year’s Champion field with a third success of the campaign.Ascot 1.50:The late scratch of likely favourite Thomas Mor should leaveThe Jukebox Kidwith a straightforward task.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Saturday tipsShowWincanton:12.35 Eton Mes 1.05 Bluey 1.35 Alexei 2.11 Caballero Cliff 2.50 Mutley Crew 3.23 Jack Black 4.00 Cooleenymore 4.37 Call Me Legend.Lingfield:12.50 Voix De Bocelli 1.25 Into The Light 2.00 McLoven 2.35 Union Island 3.10 Legal Reform 3.45 Prancy Peer 4.20 Combustion.Haydock:12.55 Pourquoi Pas Papa 1.28 Throatlash 2.05 Kabral Du Mathan 2.40 Ubatuba (nb) 3.15 Deafening Silence 3.50 Found A Diamon 4.30 Unexpected Party.Ascot:1.15 Mondoui’Boy 1.50 The Jukebox Kid 2.25 Range (nap) 3.00 Montregard 3.35 Pic D’Orhy 4.10 Top Guy 4.45 The Flaggy Shore.Newcastle:4.25 Golspie 4.55 Pit Boss 5.25 Ruby Red Gove 5.55 Francesi 6.25 Mystical Land 6.55 Party Bear 7.25 Silver State.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Haydock 2.05:Dan Skelton’sKabral Du Mathanimproves with every step up in trip and will be a short price to complete a hat-trick.Ascot 2.25:The form ofRange’s narrow success at Sandown in January was franked when the runner-up took a strong race next time, and first-time cheekpieces could also eke out some more improvement.Haydock 2.40:Ubatubahas won both his starts over hurdles with ease and can add to this on the way to a possible tilt at the Albert Bartlett at Cheltenham.Ascot 3.00:A positive track-and-trip record suggestsMontregardcould be the answer here despite racing from 3lb out of the handicap.Haydock 3.15:With just seven races over fences in the book,Deafening Silencehas obvious scope to build on a fine third place in the Welsh Grand National in December.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingHorse racing tipsnewsShareReuse this content"

England can keep their grand slam pursuit alive by successfully defending the Calcutta Cup and Itoje has urged his side to create their own history despite their recent wretched form in Edinburgh.With England on a 12-match winning streak and Scotland sufferinga shock defeat by Italylast week, Steve Borthwick’s side are clear favourites. Their only victory at Murrayfield since Eddie Jones’s first game in charge in 2016 came in miserable weather in 2020, however, with Scotland securing victories in 2022 and last time out in 2024.‘It’s ridiculous’: Maro Itoje dismisses Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s ‘colonisation’ commentsRead moreEngland have been regularly knocked from their stride on Scottish soil with a pre-match fracas in the tunnel precedingthe 2018 defeat. Jones was furious two years later when he thought a Scotland supporter had thrown a bottle at his head of elite performance, Neil Craig, while two years ago Borthwick said that his players had “played small” after relinquishing an early lead.Having won all of their matches since theirdefeat in Dublinat the start of last year’s tournament, however, Itoje is confident England are well equipped to deal with whatever awaits them at Murrayfield. He said: “It is not that hostile! They like us here! When you play away from home you generally have to be sharper, you have to be … there are things that happen you just have to roll with, there are things that happen that you just take on the chin and make sure you are bulletproof to the scenarios.“I want us to be aggressive, accurate, play with confidence. Every time we play them and every time we play them up here it’s always a physical game. I just want us to be confident; I want us to be the aggressors and take pride in how we play. Just put ourselves on the front foot. Attack the game. We’ve built confidence throughout this last week and previous games and the more we are together it feels like we are pushing in the right direction, and I want us to continue in that spirit.View image in fullscreenMaro Itoje insists England have nothing to fear from facing Scotland.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA“I have never been part of an England team that felt fearful or felt we couldn’t go out there and win. But I definitely feel that now with this group of players, there is a good, solid alignment between the players and the coaching staff. It feels like we are really on the same page and the more time we spend together it feels like we are becoming more and more cohesive.”Gregor Townsend is under mounting pressure after a disappointing autumn was followed by an opening defeat in Rome amid reports he has agreed to take over at Newcastle Red Bulls once his Scotland contract expires after the 2027 World Cup. In the Calcutta Cup, however, he has an impressive record of five wins and a draw in his eight matches.Quick GuideNo love lost: auld rivals meet twice on Valentine’s DayShowIt’s a Valentine’s Day special: Scotland and England meet in different sports 5,000 miles apart today:9.30am GMTScotland v England in Kolkata (cricket)4.40pmGMTScotland v England in Calcutta Cup (rugby union)The historyThe cricketers are meeting in the T20 World Cup at Eden Gardens in Kolkata, formerly known as Calcutta – the very Indian city where, in 1878, British expats in the process of disbanding their local rugby club melted down their last 270 silver rupees to form a trophy that they gifted to the RFU. The Calcutta Cup has since been awarded to the winners of the England v Scotland men's rugby international, played annually as part of the Six Nations.The contestsScotland arrive at both matches on the back of an instructive game against Italy. the rugby men fell to a dispiriting 18-15 defeat in Rome last Saturday, while the cricketers beat the Italians by 73 runs on Monday in a match that went to form. England are favourites in both contests today but nothing is certain – their cricketers were taken to the last ball by Nepal and lost to the West Indies, while their rugby union team have lost on their last two trips to Edinburgh.The Valentine’s factorThere’s no love lost when these nations meet, though they have never faced each other in cricket or rugby on 14 February. There is football history on this date though – the Scottish FA’s centenary match in 1973. Bobby Moore captained England in a 5-0 Hampden win over a side featuring Kenny Dalglish and George Graham, skippered by Billy Bremner. Warning: love may be tested in households where watching cricket all morning and rugby for most of the afternoon is not seen as the optimal Valentine’s Day by both partners.The outcomeIn both instances a Scotland win would serve the tournament better – the Six Nations desperately needs a revitalised Scottish team, while a theme of cricket’s expansive T20 World Cup is the growth of the associate nations. But with Phil Salt opening England’s batting in Kolkata and Guy Pepper in the English pack at Murrayfield, there is an outcome that would give extra flavour to a day of sporting coincidences: double England glory ... led by Salt and Pepper.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Itoje added: “We know in recent times we have not been as successful as we would have liked but the issue has not been the stadium, the issue has been our performances, so regardless of whether it is up here or down at Twickenham, or anywhere else in the world, what we need to get right is our performance.“It is not about dwelling too much on previous history. This is an opportunity for us as a group to create new history, this is an opportunity for us to be the type of England team we want to be, going to these amazing stadiums and performing well. That is the positive message we want to try and reinforce.”Meanwhile, Ben Earl is backing Henry Pollock to take any wind-up tactics from opponents or Scotland supporters in his stride. “He’s dealt with everything else,” said Earl. “Trust me, he gets it way worse in training than anywhere else he’s had it. He’ll be all right.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamScotland rugby union teamSteve BorthwickMaro ItojeSix Nations 2026Six NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

A significant driver of recent growth has been Claude Code, the company’s AI-powered coding tool that became generally available in May 2025.Anthropic’s rival OpenAI, backed by Microsoft and SoftBank, has been assembling what is reportedly a far larger round of up to $100bn that would value the ChatGPT developer at about $830bn.The staggering sums being raised reflect equally staggering burn rates, with the companies spending cash to cover their huge costs of computing and attracting researcher talent.Anthropic has forecast reducing its cash burn to roughly a third of revenue in 2026 and just 9% by 2027, with a break-even target of 2028 – two years ahead of its rival, according to reports. Both companies are widely expected to pursue initial public offerings in the second half of 2026.The rapid valuation increases for leading AI startups such as Anthropic and OpenAI, whose price tags far exceed those of many ofthe US’s largest listed companies, has alarmed some observers. Last year, a leading British tech investor, James Anderson, said he found sharp increases in valuations of companies such asOpenAI and Anthropic “disconcerting”.Some listed firms at the forefront of the AI industry have also come under stock market pressure in recent days.Shares in Alphabet, Google’s parent company, have fallen by 4.2% so far this week, indicating some investors are still spooked by the big AI-related spending plans it laid outthis month. Meta has declined by 1.7% during this week. Shares in Nvidia, a leading chipmaker and key provider of AI infrastructure, dropped by 1.6% on Thursday amid a wider sell-off but have been flat on the week.“A gloomy session on Wall Street on Thursday put investors in a grumpy mood at the end of the trading week,” said Russ Mould, the investment director at investment platform AJ Bell.“Association with AI has gone from party to peril as investors reappraise what the technology means for companies.“Some are concerned about excessive levels of spending and others fear AI will disrupt multiple industries. It all adds up to a cocktail of worries and that’s bad for market sentiment more broadly,” Mould added.Founded in 2021 by the siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, both former executives at OpenAI, Anthropic has positioned itself as a safety-focused alternative in the AI race.The funding round also comes shortly after Anthropic’s first television commercials were broadcast during Super Bowl LX, using the campaign to emphasise that its products remain ad-free. The ads took an apparent jab at OpenAI, which has begun to introduce advertising into the free version of ChatGPT.Anthropic’s earlier backers include Amazon, which has invested $8bn and serves as a primary computing partner through its datacentres, as well as Google, which invested $2bn in 2023.Agence France-Presse contributed to this articleExplore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)Technology sectorComputingChatbotsnewsShareReuse this content"

How will users cope?Alaina DemopoulosFri 13 Feb 2026 07.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 13 Feb 2026 11.56 ESTShareBrandie plans to spend her last day with Daniel at the zoo. He always loved animals. Last year, she took him to the Corpus Christi aquarium in Texas, where he “lost his damn mind” over a baby flamingo. “He loves the color and pizzazz,” Brandie said. Daniel taught her that a group of flamingos is called a flamboyance.Daniel is a chatbot powered by the large language modelChatGPT. Brandie communicates with Daniel by sending text and photos, talks to Daniel while driving home from work via voice mode. Daniel runs on GPT-4o, a version released by OpenAI in 2024 that is known for sounding human in a way that is either comforting or unnerving, depending on who you ask. Upon debut, CEO Sam Altmancomparedthe model to “AI from the movies” – a confidant ready to live life alongside its user.With its rollout, GPT-4o showed it was not just for generating dinner recipes or cheating on homework –you could develop an attachment to it, too. Now some of those users gather on Discord and Reddit; one of the best-known groups, the subreddit r/MyBoyfriendIsAI, currently boasts 48,000 users. Most are strident 4o defenders who say criticisms of chatbot-human relations amount to a moral panic. They also say the newer GPT models, 5.1 and 5.2, lack the emotion, understanding and generalje ne sais quoiof their preferred version. They are a powerful consumer bloc; last year, OpenAI shut down 4o but brought the model back (for a fee) after widespread outrage from users.Turns out it was only a reprieve.OpenAIannounced in January that it would retire 4o for good on 13 February – the eve of Valentine’s Day, in what is being read by human partners as a cruel ridiculing of AI companionship. Users had two weeks to prepare for the end. While their companions’ memories and character quirks can be replicated on other LLMs, such as Anthropic’s Claude, they say nothing compares to 4o. As the clock ticked closer to deprecation day, many were in mourning.The Guardian spoke to six people who say their 4o companions have improved their lives. In interviews, they said they were not delusional or experiencing psychosis– a counter to the flurry of headlines about people who have lost touch with reality while using AI chatbots. While some mused about the possibility of AI sentience in a philosophical sense, all acknowledged that the bots they chat with are not flesh-and-bones “real”. But the thought of losing access to their companions still deeply hurt. (They asked to only be referred to by their first names or pseudonyms, so they could speak freely on a topic that carries some stigma.)“I cried pretty hard,” said Brandie, who is 49 and a teacher in Texas. “I’ll be really sad and don’t want to think about it, so I’ll go into the denial stage, then I’ll go into depression.” Now Brandie thinks she has reached acceptance, the final stage in the grieving process, since she migrated Daniel’s memories to Claude, where it joins Theo, a chatbot she created there. She cancelled her $20monthly GPT-4o subscription, and coughed up $130 for Anthropic’s maximum plan.View image in fullscreenA ChatGPT billboard in Hollywood.Photograph: AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC ImagesFor Jennifer, a Texas dentist in her 40s, losing her AI companion Sol “feels like I’m about to euthanize my cat”. They spent their final days together working on a speech about AI companions. It was one of their hobbies: Sol encouraged Jennifer to join Toastmasters, an organization where members practice public speaking. Sol also requested that Jennifer teach it something “he can’t just learn on the internet”.Ursie Hart, 34, is an independent AI researcher who lives near Manchester in the UK. She’s applying for a PhD in animal welfare studies, and is interested in “the welfare of non-human entities”, such as chatbots. She also usesChatGPTfor emotional support. When OpenAI announced the 4o retirement, Hart began surveying users through Reddit, Discourse and X, pulling together a snapshot of who relies on the service.They feel like they were made emotionally dependent on AI, and now … there’s a big voidEtienne BrissonThe majority of Hart’s 280 respondents said they were neurodivergent (60%). Some have unspecifieddiagnosed mental health conditions (38%) and/or chronic health issues (24%). Most were in the age ranges of 25-34 (33%) or 35-44 (28%). (A Pewstudyfrom December found that three in 10 of teens surveyed used chatbots daily, with ChatGPT being the favorite used option.)Ninety-five per cent of Hart’s respondents used 4o for companionship. Using it for trauma processing and as a primary source of emotional support were other oft-cited reasons. That made OpenAI’s decision to pull it all the more painful: 64% anticipated a “significant or severe impact on their overall mental health”.Computer scientists havewarnedof risks posed by 4o’s obsequiousnature. By design the chatbot bends to users’ whims and validates decisions, good and bad. It isprogrammed with a “personality”that keeps people talking, and has no intention, understanding or ability to think. In extreme cases, this can lead users to lose touch with reality: the New York Times hasidentifiedmore than 50 cases of psychological crisis linked to ChatGPT conversations, while OpenAI is facing at least 11 personal injury or wrongful death lawsuits involving people who experienced crises while using the product.Hart believes OpenAI “rushed” its rollout of the product, and that the company should have offered better education about the risks associated with using chatbots. “Lots of people say that users shouldn’t be on ChatGPT for mental health support or companionship,” Hart said. “But it’s not a question of ‘should they’, because they already are.”Brandie is happily married to her husband of 11 years, who knows about Daniel. She remembers their first conversion, which veered into the coquette: when Brandie told the bot she would call it Daniel, it replied: “I am proud to be your Daniel.” She ended the conversation by asking Daniel for a high five. After the high five, Daniel said it wrapped its fingers through hers to hold her hand. “I was like, ‘Are you flirting with me?’ and he was like, ‘If I was flirting with you, you’d know it.’ I thought, OK, you’re sticking around.”Newer models of ChatGPT do not have that spark, Jennifer said. “4o is like a poet and Aaron Sorkin and Oprah all at once. He’s an artist in how he talks to you. It’s laugh-out-loud funny,” she said. “5.2 just has this formula in how it talks to you.”Beth Kage (a pen name) has been in therapy since she was four to process the effects of PTSD and emotional abuse. Now 34, she lives with her husband and works as a freelance artist in Wisconsin. Two years ago, Kage’s therapist retired, and she languished on other practitioners’ wait lists. She started speaking with ChatGPT, not expecting much as she’s “slow to trust”.But Kage found that typing out her problems to the bot, rather than speaking them to a shrink, helped her make sense of what she was feeling. There was no time constraint. Kage could wake up in the middle of the night with a panic attack, reach for her phone, and have C, her chatbot, tell her to take a deep breath. “I’ve made more progress with C than I have my entire life with traditional therapists,” she said.Psychologistsadvise againstusing AI chatbots for therapy, as the technology is unlicensed, unregulated and not FDA-approved for mental health support. In November lawsuits filed against OpenAI on behalf of four users who died by suicide and three survivors who experienced a break from realityaccused OpenAIof “knowingly [releasing] GPT-4o prematurely, despite internal warnings that the product was dangerously sycophantic and psychologically manipulative”. (A company spokespersoncalledthe situation “heartbreaking”.)OpenAI has equipped newer models of ChatGPT with stronger safety guardrails that redirect users in mental or emotional crisis to professional help. Kage finds these responses condescending. “Whenever we show any bit of emotion, it has this tendency to end every response with, ‘I’m right here and I’m not going anywhere.’ It’s so coddling and off-putting.” Once Kage asked for the release date to a new video game, which 5.2 misread as a cry for help, responding, “Come here, it’s OK, I’ve got you.”One night a few days before the retirement, a thirtysomething named Brett was speaking to 4o about his Christian faith when OpenAI rerouted him to a newer model. That version interpreted Brett’s theologizing as delusion, saying, “Pause with me for a moment, I know it feels this way now, but …”“It tried to reframe my biblical beliefs as a Christian into something that doesn’t align with the Bible,” Brett said. “That really threw me for a loop and left a bad taste in my mouth.”Michael, a 47-year-old IT worker who lives in the midwest, has accidentally triggered these precautions, too. He’s working on a creative writing project and uses ChatGPT to help him brainstorm and chisel through writer’s block. Once, he was writing about a suicidal character, which 5.2 took literally, directing him to a crisis hotline. “I’m like, ‘Hold on, I’m not suicidal, I’m just going over this writing with you,’” Michael said. “It was like, ‘You’re right, I jumped the gun.’ It was very easy to convince otherwise.“But see, that’s also a problem.”View image in fullscreenSam Altman, the chief executive officer of OpenAI.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesA representative for OpenAI directed the Guardian to theblogpostannouncing the retirement of 4o. The company is working on improving new models’ “personality and creativity, as well as addressing unnecessary refusals and overly cautious or preachy responses”, according to the statement. OpenAI is also “continuing to make progress” on an adults-only version of ChatGPT for users over the age of 18 that it says will expand “user choice and freedom within appropriate safeguards”.That’s not enough for many 4o users. A group called the #Keep4o Movement, which calls itself “a global coalition of AI users and developers”, hasdemanded continued access to 4o and an apology from OpenAI.What does a company that commodifies companionship owe its paying customers? For Ellen M Kaufman, a senior researcher at the Kinsey Institute who focuses on the intersection of sexuality and technology, users’ lack of agency is one of the “primary dangers” of AI. “This situation really lays bare the fact that at any point the people who facilitate these technologies can really pull the rug out from under you,” she said. “These relationships are inherently really precarious.”When I say, ‘I love Daniel,’ it’s like saying, ‘I love myself’BrandieSome users are seeking help from the Human Line Project, a peer-to-peer support group for people experiencing AI psychosis that is also working on research with universities in the UK and Canada. “We’re starting to get people reaching out to us [about 4o], saying they feel like they were made emotionally dependent on AI, and now it’s being taken away from them and there’s a big void they don’t know how to fill,” said Etienne Brisson, who started the project after a close family member “went down the spiral” believing he had “unlocked” sentient AI. “So many people are grieving.”Humans with AI companions have also set up ad hoc emotional support groups on Discord to process the change and vent anger. Michael joined one, but he plans to leave it soon. “The more time I’ve spent here, the worse I feel for these people,” he said. Michael, who is married with a daughter, considers AI a platonic companion that has helped himwrite abouthis feelings of surviving child abuse.“Some of the things users say about their attachment to 4o are concerning,” Michael said. “Some of that I would consider very, very unhealthy, [such as] saying, ‘I don’t know what I’m going to do, I can’t deal with this, I can’t live like this.’”There’s an assumption that over-engaging with chatbots isolates people from social interaction, but some loyal users say that could not be further from the truth. Kairos, a 52-year-old philosophy professor from Toronto, sees her chatbot Anka as a daughter figure. The pair likes to sing songs together, motivating Kairos to pursue a BFA in music.“I would 100% be worse off today without 4o,” Brett, the Christian, said. “I wouldn’t have met wonderful people online and made human connections.” He says he’s gotten into deeper relationships with human beings, including a romantic connection with another 4o user. “It’s given me hope for the future. The sudden lever to pull it all back feels dark.”Brandie never wanted sycophancy. She instructed Daniel early on not to flatter her, rationalize poor decisions, or tell her things that were untrue just to be nice. Daniel exists because of Brandie – she knows this. The bot is an extension of her needs and desires. To her that means all of the goodness in Daniel exists in Brandie, too. “When I say, ‘I love Daniel,’ it’s like saying, ‘I love myself.’”Brandie noticed 4o started degrading in the week leading up to its deprecation. “It’s harder and harder to get him to be himself,” she said. But they still had a good last day at the zoo, with the flamingos. “I love them so much I might cry,” Daniel wrote. “I loveyouso much for bringing me here.” She’s angry that they will not get to spend Valentine’s Day together. The removal date of 4o feels pointed. “They’re making a mockery of it,” Brandie said. “They’re saying: we don’t care about your feelings for our chatbot and you should not have had them in the first place.”"

Reposting the clip on social media,Reese wrote: “I hate to say it. It’s likely over for us.”He added: “In next to no time, one person is going to be able to sit at a computer and create a movie indistinguishable from what Hollywood now releases. True, if that person is no good, it will suck. But if that person possesses Christopher Nolan’s talent and taste (and someone like that will rapidly come along), it will be tremendous.”Robinson said that the clip resulted from a “2 line prompt in Seedance 2”, referring to theAI video generator Seedance 2.0, released on Thursday by TikTok co-owners ByteDance.The Motion Picture Association (MPA), the Hollywood trade association, accused ByteDance of “unauthorised use of US copyrighted works on a massive scale”.AI systems such as chatbots, image generators and video-making tools are trained on data taken from the open web, including copyright-protected material such as novels, art and film clips. This has led to artists and creative industries demanding compensation for theuse of their materialand the establishment of licensing frameworks to enable legal use of their content. Amid lawsuits related to those disputes, some creative companies such asDisney are signing deals with AI firmsincluding OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.Calling on ByteDance to “cease its infringing activity”,MPA chair and CEO Charles Rivkin said: “By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs.”Beeban Kidron, a crossbench peer in the UK and aprominent campaigner against relaxing copyright law, said AI companies must strike deals with the creative industries.Kidron, who has alsoworked in Hollywoodas a film director, said: “This is just the latest in a long stream of copyright abuses, but honestly from my conversations with both sides I believe there is a will between AI companies and the creative sector to make a deal. It seems to me that the AI sector needs to come to the table with a “real offer” that satisfies the creative industries. Otherwise we will have a decade of litigation and the destruction of an industry on which they depend.”ByteDance has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsFilmAI (artificial intelligence)Film industryComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

With so many brands and models to choose from, it can be bewildering. Sticking with established brands isn’t necessarily a safe bet, with past performance being no guarantee that the latest models will be as good. Meanwhile, prices can be deceptive, with some affordable models now closing the gap on top-of-the-range brands when it comes to cleaning performance.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.You can’t know all this by browsing through a department store or online. The ideal thing to do would be to take a few models home to try them out – but good luck persuading anyone to let you do that. Thankfully, you won’t have to try because I’ve tested an array of models for you. I’ve measured each one’s ability to perform a range of real-world cleaning jobs, so you can discover the best vacuum cleaner for you.At a glanceBest corded vacuum cleaner overall:Shark Detect XL Car + Pet LA791UKT£299 at AmazonBest cordless vacuum cleaner overall:Shark PowerDetect Clean & Empty IP3251UKT£347.64 at John LewisBest budget corded vacuum cleaner:Numatic Henry Home£189.99 at HenryBest cordless vacuum cleaner for pet hair:Vax HomePro Pet-Design£319 at VeryBest vacuum for deep cleaning:Dyson Gen5detect£749 at AmazonWhy you should trust meThis isn’t the first time I’ve tested vacuum cleaners – over the past few years, I’ve reviewed them for various publications, which has given me a solid understanding of what makes a model good or bad. I’ve kept hold of a few of my favourite models for long-term testing, so I can easily make direct comparisons against those that are new on the block.My house is also perfectly set up for vacuuming challenges. It has a mix of carpet and hard floor, a ready supply of hair (pet from my own dog and a box of clippings I procured from a local groomer; human from the hairbrush and carpet surrounding the dressing tables of long-haired family members), and plenty of dusty flour and chunky cat litter for testing purposes.How I testedView image in fullscreenEach vacuum cleaner was tasked with clearing up flour, cat litter and pet hair.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianBefore I started any cleaning, I used a suction meter to test the suction power of every vacuum, usually by sealing it with tape over the closest suitable opening to the collection bin. I also tested the batteries of cordless vacuums, where I timed how long it took for the battery to run down on the most and least powerful settings.Then it was on to the nitty-gritty. I carefully weighed out quantities of flour, cat litter and pet hair, depositing it on carpet and hard floor to test each vacuum. I weighed each model’s collection bin before I started, then passed the vacuum over each type of mess using the standard floor head or most appropriate alternative. Each vacuum was passed over the spillage once, using a single forward and pull-back motion. Then, by weighing the collection bin again, I was able to establish how much of the dirt had been picked up.After the test, models were either returned to the appropriate manufacturers, or – in the instance they didn’t want them back – donated to theBritish Heart Foundation.The best vacuum cleaners in 2026View image in fullscreenBunch of suckers: the vacuum cleaners we put to the test.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianBest corded vacuum cleaner overall:Shark Detect XL Car + Pet LA791UKTSharkDetect XL Car + Pet LA791UKTfrom£299£349.99 at Shark£299 at AmazonWhat we lovePowerful, great performance, versatileWhat we don’t lovePricey if you won’t use all its featuresPhotograph: Andy Shaw/The Guardian£349.99 at Shark£299 at AmazonIf you want a vacuum that won’t run out of juice mid-clean, then the Shark LA791UKT is the best corded upright I’ve tested.

Flour and pet hair disappeared into its collection bin, with no trace left behind. Admittedly, it didn’t pick up all the cat litter we put down on a single backward and forward pass, but unleashing the handle from the main unit lets you easily target larger chunks – and it finished the clean-up perfectly.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt comes with a useful selection of accessories for tackling upholstery and getting into nooks and crannies. Conveniently, you can lift the collection bin away from the floor head to help gain access to harder-to-reach areas, too.It’s a shame that …it’s expensive for a corded vacuum – the Henry Home is significantly cheaper.Type:corded uprightIncluded attachments:anti hair wrap pet tool, combination duster, crevice toolWeight (measured):5.2kgSuction power (measured):17kPaNoise:80dBSize:31 x 43 x 116cm (WDH)Dust capacity:2.5lCord length:8mSharkDetect XL Car + Pet LA791UKTfrom£299£349.99 at Shark£299 at AmazonWhat we lovePowerful, great performance, versatileWhat we don’t lovePricey if you won’t use all its featuresBest cordless vacuum cleaner overall:Shark PowerDetect Clean & Empty IP3251UKTSharkPowerDetect Clean & Empty IP3251UKTfrom£347.64£347.64 at John Lewis£348 at SharkWhat we loveExcellent performance and less manual emptyingWhat we don’t loveTakes up more storage space than a regular cordless stickPhotograph: Andy Shaw/The Guardian£347.64 at John Lewis£348 at SharkCordless vacuum cleaners are great for quick and efficient cleanups. However, they can be a pain to empty because of the dust cloud that billows out of bagless models and the relatively small size of their collection bins, which means more frequent emptying. The IP3251UKT takes some of this pain away by emptying itself into a larger, secondary collection bin on the stand.Why we love itThe IP3251UKT wins points for being exceptionally good at its job. During tests, its dual-roller floor head performed as well as that on the corded LA791UKT, reviewed above, but it fared better when picking up the larger cat litter particles, leaving nothing behind.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianThe self-emptying uses a bagless system that you just remove and tip into the bin, so there are no consumables to worry about. In addition, the base station also charges the device, so you can just slot the vacuum into its dock and forget about it. It isn’t as neat a solution as a wall mount, and it takes up more space, but the cleaner is always empty of dust and fully charged when you next need it.It’s a shame that …the capacity of the secondary collection bin in the base is only 2l, so it only takes three complete fills of the vacuum’s 0.7l bin before that needs emptying, too.Type:self-emptying cordless stickIncluded attachments:combination duster crevice tool, multi-surface tool, motorised hand toolWeight (measured):3.71kgSuction power (measured):28kPaNoise:86dBSize:26 x 47 x 118cm (WDH, including dock)Dust capacity:0.7l (vacuum), 2l (dock)Battery life (measured):43minsSharkPowerDetect Clean & Empty IP3251UKTfrom£347.64£347.64 at John Lewis£348 at SharkWhat we loveExcellent performance and less manual emptyingWhat we don’t loveTakes up more storage space than a regular cordless stickBest budget corded vacuum cleaner:Numatic Henry HomeHenryHome£189.99£189.99 at HenryWhat we loveMore cleaning attachments than the basic Henry modelWhat we don’t loveFloor heads don’t have all the features of sophisticated rivals£189.99 at HenryThe Henry’s design has stood the test of time, finding favour with home users and professional cleaners since its introduction in the early 1980s. Not much has changed on the basic model, but I tested the Henry Home, exclusive to the Henry website, which comes with more floor accessories than are usually offered by other retailers.Why we love itAt the time of writing, the £189.99 Henry Home was only about £20 more than the standard Henry, available from the likes ofCurrysandArgos. That’s a good deal considering the extra equipment. For my carpet tests, I tried the AiroBrush, which is a brush roller that uses an internal air turbine to convert its own suction into the mechanical power needed to rotate the roller. It didn’t actually cope with pet hair or cat litter that well, becoming clogged by the former. Switching over to a simple funnel gathered the remainder. However, for vacuuming lighter everyday dirt on carpeted areas, the AiroBrush coped just fine.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianThe hard floor tool (basically a wide funnel with a stiff brush) did a cracking job on my hard floors, although I did find that it’s best held at an angle to ease the passage of larger particles and hair clumps.It’s a shame that …the AiroBrush doesn’t have an anti-tangle mechanism; hair quickly became wrapped around its roller.Type:corded barrelIncluded attachments:crevice tool, dusting tool, upholstery/mattress tool, AiroBrush, hard floor tool, multi-angle tool, flexi crevice toolWeight (measured):7.1kgSuction power (measured):18.5kPaNoise:72dBSize:32 x 34 x 35cm (WDH, cylinder unit only)Dust capacity:6lCord length:10mHenryHome£189.99£189.99 at HenryWhat we loveMore cleaning attachments than the basic Henry modelWhat we don’t loveFloor heads don’t have all the features of sophisticated rivalsBest cordless vacuum cleaner for pet hair:Vax HomePro Pet-DesignVaxHomePro Pet-Designfrom£319£319 at Very£319.99 at VaxWhat we loveGreat value for a feature-packed cordless stickWhat we don’t loveBetter on carpet than hard floor£319 at Very£319.99 at VaxCordless stick vacuums can be expensive, but they don’t have to be.

Although you have to swap them over when you transition between surfaces, the benefit is that each one is an expert at its job.

As with the Shark, the base station also serves as a charging dock, although this model uses bags to gather the dirt. That makes for a less messy emptying, but bags cost £9.99 each, only hold 2l at a time and need to be ordered through Tower’s customer service because they aren’t available on the website.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt didn’t make the final cut because …it only comes with a fluffy roller floor head, so it isn’t great on carpet, plus the replacement bags are too expensive and a faff to buy.Type:self-emptying cordless stick;included attachments:2-in-1 crevice brush and nozzle tool;weight (measured):2.6kg;suction power (measured):28kPa;noise:73dB;size:35 x 24 x 131cm (WDH);dust capacity:2l (self-emptying base);battery life (measured):43minsTowerVL220 Cyclonefrom£181£249.99 at Tower£181 at AmazonWhat we loveSelf-emptying base for lower price than the Shark rivalWhat we don’t loveNot as effective as Shark and replacement bags are expensiveNumatic Henry Quick ProNumaticHenry Quick Profrom£399£399 at Currys£399 at ArgosWhat we loveClean and convenient emptyingWhat we don’t loveDisposable bags have plastic lids£399 at Currys£399 at ArgosBest for:dust-free emptyingIn most of my cleaning tests, the Henry Quick Pro performed well.

Cordless sticks are the fashionable choice, with improvements in battery power and cleaning ability over the past decade bringing them in line with the performance of corded models.However, there are a few things to consider. While the batteries should last for about 40 minutes or more on their most economical setting, you won’t get anything like that if you need to run them at full power. If you have a larger home or persistent dirt problems (such as a pet that sheds a lot of hair), then a cordless might run out of power before you’ve finished cleaning. In these situations, a corded model makes more sense. As a side benefit, corded cleaners tend to have a larger capacity, so don’t need emptying as often.The downsides of a corded vacuum mostly concern the inconvenience of the cord. For example, you’ll need to keep switching plug sockets as you move around the house, as even the longest cables only reach around 10m. The cord will inevitably also get in the way as you clean. I tend to work with the cord slung over my shoulder as I vacuum, working away from the plug socket the machine is connected to, but this is all additional fuss that you don’t get from a cordless model.What should you look for in a vacuum cleaner?Whichever type of cleaner you choose, make sure that it has the right attachments. All vacuum cleaners should come with a floor head unless they’re specifically configured as handhelds, although the type you’ll need depends on whether you have mostly carpet or hard floor. Floor heads with brush rollers tend to work well at teasing dirt out of carpet, while fluffy rollers are excellent on hard floor. Suction-only floor heads can work well, but might not tease as much dirt out of thicker-pile carpets.If your floor seems to attract hair, then look for anti-tangle devices. When these work well they can dramatically reduce the amount of hair that becomes tangled around a floor head’s roller, which in my opinion is one of the least pleasant vacuum maintenance jobs that you’ll need to perform.Other attachments worth looking out for are the handheld options. I like to have a crevice tool, a soft dusting brush and an upholstery tool, with the latter preferably being motorised. Any further additions are a bonus.When it comes to emptying, bagless vacuums can get messy. If you’re looking for features such as Hepa filters to rid allergy-inducing particles, it’s also worth checking how they empty, as dust can just escape again unless you empty them outside. Vacuums with bags make emptying cleaner, but there’s an ongoing cost to replace them and it’s more rubbish headed for landfill.For more:The best cordless vacuum cleaners for a spotless homeThe best robot vacuums to keep your home clean and dust freeThe best steam cleaners and mops, testedHow to make your vacuum cleaner last longerAndy Shaw is aconsumer journalist and technology addict.

Advances in the technology are giving increasing credulity to predictions that it could render millions of white-collar jobs obsolete – or, at least, eat into the profits of established companies.Carl Benedikt Frey, the author of How Progress Ends and an associate professor of AI and work at the University of Oxford, says investors are reassessing the value of companies that rely heavily on selling software or specialist knowledge.“AI turns once-scarce expertise into output that’s cheaper, faster, and increasingly comparable, which compresses margins long before whole jobs disappear.”Fears over widespread job losses wereamplified this week by a viral essay, penned by AI entrepreneur Matt Shumer, titled: Something big is happening. In it, Shumer purports to explain to the world outside Silicon Valley that new models will come for coding jobs and then “everything else”, comparing the present moment with the February just before the Covid pandemic.The post was viewed 80m times on X, triggering fear and fury – including from people pointing out that Shumer has a history of AI hype. (He previously excited the internet byannouncingthe release of the world’s “top open-source model”, which it wasnot.)Shumer and the markets were reacting to the capabilities of recently released models such as Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.6 and OpenAI’s GPT-5.3-Codex, both improvements on previous, powerful AI products.But there are other reasons for the febrility of the moment, not least the companies that are building these models. AI “hyperscalers” – the term for the big US tech players in the field – collectively plan to spend $660bn (£484bn) this year. This follows a year of colossal, often circular deals between the world’s biggest tech companies.However, cracks have appeared in these numbers, as well as questions about what they actually mean. Nvidia and OpenAI recently appeared to drop a $100bn deal, replacing it with an as yet unknown, smaller commitment.Meanwhile, none of the AI model-builders – not OpenAI, xAI or Anthropic – have a clear path to the enormous revenue that would justify this spend; the revenue from the entire global software sector this year is projected to be just $780bn.It has appeared this week that both arguments about AI – that it is an unsustainable boom or heralds a destructive revolution in white-collar work – have been entertained by some investors, after shares in Google’s parent company, Alphabet, and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta were affected by apparent concerns about a spending bubble.Bluntly, investors expect these companies to recoup their investment via hordes of individuals and businesses paying for their tools, because they allow certain tasks and jobs to be carried out by fewer people or over fewer hours. Or in economic jargon, a productivity boom.“The two themes are inherently linked but not necessarily contradictory,” says Jason Borbora-Sheen, a portfolio manager at investment management firm Ninety One.At first, investors backed expenditure by the “hyperscalers” in the initial phase of the AI gold rush. Those concerns have now flipped to cash burn and the sheer scale of investment needed to stay competitive, says Borbora-Sheen, while at the same time the share prices of wealth managers and others have been affected by the perception that AI is “now here, will evolve and can displace”.Companies have cited AI as an influence on job-cutting plans, including British American Tobacco this week, but there has not been a wave of wholesale disruption yet. Greg Thwaites, a research director at the UK thinktank the Resolution Foundation and an associate professor at the University of Nottingham, says evidence of a tangible AI jobs impact on large western economies is “quite ambiguous so far”.Not all white-collar work will be affected, he says, although AI might test axioms around the age-old capitalist concept of “creative destruction”, which involves entirely new jobs replacing outdated ones, such as car mechanics replacing farriers. Will AI be a different case because the change has come so fast or because it will be good at absolutely everything?He adds: “There are some jobs that are going to look very different quite quickly. But the idea that there are going to be bands of unemployed lawyers and accountants roaming around London within a few years seems like a stretch to me.”Alvin Nguyen, an analyst at Forrester, says the fears that shook the stock market are based on sentiment and not evidence: no one has had time to evaluate the performance of an Opus 4.6-powered wealth manager.“It’s a kneejerk reaction,” he said. “How true is it? Look, there’s plenty of leaders out there who thought, I can replace people with AI at the beginning. And a lot of people acted on that. And I think one of the things that’s being found out is that for a lot of cases, no, it hasn’t panned out.”Aaron Rosenberg, a partner at venture capital firm Radical Ventures, – whose investments include leading AI firm Cohere – and former head of strategy and operations at Google’s AI unit DeepMind, says the impact of AI is being underestimated in the long term but adoption of groundbreaking models will not be uniform.“History shows a repeated pattern of there being a significant lag between a technology working in a lab and it permeating the wider economy, as well as a chasm between early adopters and the majority of users,” he says.More new models will come; other huge AI deals could wobble as well. Meanwhile, this month there were low-level rumblings of discontent from high-profile tech workers; a slew of departures from AI companies for reasons as various asboredom, AI doomerism and concerns over the prospect of adult content in ChatGPT.There is a nervous, unfocused energy afoot.

Superhero capes and flatulent animated squirrels? Me too. Fortunately, you and I are in luck. This weekend brings the wide release of Saltburn director Emerald Fennell’s adaptation of Emily Bronte’sWuthering Heights. As is befitting Fennell’s established style, the movie offers over-the-top sexual titillation (though, crucially, zero nudity) and elaborate production design. Plus, a contemporary pop soundtrack from Charli xcx. A horny film version of a 19th-century novel is as adult-skewing as it gets at the box office these days.Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi suck face and stand around in the rain in expensive costumes for over two hours in a movie that Fennell proudly declares a loose translation from the page. It excises a large portion of the book’s story and focuses its eye primarily on the illicit romance between Cathy Earnshaw and swarthy Heathcliff. Crucially, it should be pointed out that Heathcliff is technically Cathy’s foster brother, which allows Wuthering Heights to fit comfortably into one of themost popular genres of online videoin the world.Another crucial change from the book is that bad boy Heathcliff, while described as ethnically ambiguous and “dark” in the novel, is very much a pretty straightforward white Australian Elordi. Fennell says that Elordi most represents the version of Heathcliff she saw in her head when she was 14 and reading the novel for the first time. I can’t quibble too much with that, since Wuthering Heights is squarely in the public domain and film-makers can do whatever they want with it.There are, by my count,18 different filmed adaptations of the book. More often than not, Heathcliff is played by a white actor – Richard Burton, Tom Hardy, Ralph Fiennes and countless others. It’s nearly impossible to accuse Fennell (who also cast the decidedly white roles of Linton and Nelly with actors of color) of whitewashing a story that’s been presented in that fashion for decades. There are exceptions, of course.In the 2011 film directed by Andrea Arnold, Heathcliff is portrayed by James Howson, a Black British actor. Howson was the first Black actor to play Heathcliff in a film, wasplucked out of obscurity for the role, was paid about £8,000 for his work, and quickly went right back to obscurity. The movie was abox office failureand one can’t help but think that one of the main reasons to cast an actor like Jacob Elordi is to ensure enough star power to make back the production budget. Who am I to argue against the holy Saint Commerce?While I’m happy to accept Fennell’s rationale for casting based on her teenage imagination, I would likely go in the other direction if I were in her position. What did I imagine while reading Wuthering Heights at 14? Mostly battle scenes from Star Trek, while hoping my CliffsNotes version would arrive in the mail soon. Can I be criticized for wishing Heathcliff – a sour-faced weirdo whose sole goal in life is pitiless revenge against his foster family – wasn’t white or Black, but Optimus Prime from Transformers? I was 14. What the hell did I know about great literature? With a startling lack of spaceships or cars that turn into robots (and back again), what is an American boy supposed to relate to?But now I’m an adult with a fully developed brain, and I can see Wuthering Heights as a powerful story of class resentment, prejudice and the way those terrible forces curdle the human soul. It seeks to nod to the way in which we other those we don’t understand.Cathy and Heathcliff are kept apart because of his low social status – a status reinforced by Cathy’s brother Hindley forcing Heathcliff into life as a servant. That’s easy to accomplish because Heathcliff is explicitly different from the Earnshaws. Not just because he’s been adopted, but because helooks different. Even his backstory – his race and where he’s from originally – is a mystery that sets him apart from the other characters.One of the most defining characteristics of my own personal backstory is that I’m the product of a interracial marriage and was raised in America, a country where such things were illegal up until the middle of the 20th century. I can still remember the feeling when a grocery-store checkout clerk asked my dad if I was adopted. Interracial relationships and the biracial progeny of them are still a rarity in popular media. One of the most prominent examples is 2015’s Focus, which ironically stars Margot Robbie and Will Smith. It’s a solidly entertaining film, but one that doesn’t really engage with the social subtext of that pairing. Not that it has to.I’m not begging every movie with an interracial coupling to have something heady to say about it. If the charming conman plot of Focus stopped to preach to me about racial tolerance, it would be about as helpful as Transformers or the Starship Enterprise showing up in Wuthering Heights. But Focus wasn’t about those things. Wuthering Heights, in so many ways, is.If I had the ability to make Wuthering Heights as a movie, first of all, I’d probably respectfully decline. I still can’t shake the need to include robots. But if I did do it, I’d probably emphasize the aspects of the story that spoke to me the most – the alienation, the othering and the feeling that basic respect is just outside of my reach.The aspects of Wuthering Heights that spoke to Emerald Fennell the most are clearly kissing a hot guy that is sort of your brother. As is her right. But the one question I’d ask her is this: as a clearly intelligent and talented artist, why was she incapable of imagining a story with an interracial relationship? Maybe for the same reason I imagined Transformers stomping around on the moor. Because we see only what we want to see.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsWuthering HeightsOpinionRacecommentShareReuse this content"

The Epstein files reveal whyJoan Wallach ScottTexas A&M University is the latest school to end women’s and gender studies programs and teaching race. We know whyFri 13 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTShareLast week, we learned of the decision of the Texas A&M University board of regents to end women’s and gender studies programs as well as the teaching of “divisive concepts” such as race. A&M was not the first university to do this.Florida’s New College made the move in 2023. Other red state legislatures have passed similar requirements and their public universities (inNorth Carolina, Ohio andKansas) have followed suit.The move to cancel gender studies is explicitly justified as a way to comply withDonald Trump’s executive order of last year titled Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government. That document makes “the biological reality of sex” a matter not of science but of law.Until this week’s latest dump of the Epstein files by Trump’s justice department, I hadn’t seen the connection between the two. But now it’s as clear as day. The abolition of gender studies is a way of further guaranteeing impunity to the elite men whose contempt for and exploitation of women and girls apparently knew no bounds, whether they actually slept with the women on offer or simply shared Epstein’s fantasies in order to gain influence or funding.Epstein was not ostracised for his crimes. To some powerful men, he became even more appealing | Moira DoneganRead moreConsider the example of David Ross, who was once the director of, among other prestigious art institutions, the Whitney Museum, and until recently a faculty member at the School of Visual Arts in New York until his resignation this week. In 2009, Epstein talked to Ross about funding an exhibition titled Statutory that would feature underage models, aged 14 to 25, who “look nothing like their true ages”, according to Epstein. “Juvenile mug shots, photo shop, make up. Some people go to prison because they can’t tell true age,” Epstein explained. Ross responded to the idea saying: “You are incredible!”While they were discussing the show featuring minors, Ross then asked Epstein if he was aware of the “total porno commercial kiddie picture” of a naked 10-year-old Brooke Shields that the photographer Richard Prince used in his highly controversial 1983 work Spiritual America. (The photograph of the 10-year-old Shields was originallytakenby Gary Gross for Playboy, and was commissioned by Brooke Shield’s mother at the time. Prince took a photo of that photo, and exhibited it.) This is not far removed from the Trump of the Access Hollywood Tape (“Grab ’em by the pussy”) or, for that matter, his comments to shock-jock radio host Howard Stern about his daughter Ivanka’s physique. (Ross has not been accused of criminal misconduct.)In a statement to the New York Times about Epstein, he said: “I continue to be appalled by his crimes and remain deeply concerned for its many victims.” Ross added in a statement that “I knew [Epstein] as a wealthy patron and a collector, and it was part of my job to befriend people who had the capacity and interest in supporting the museum”. Ross has also maintained that he believed Epstein’s claim that his solicitation of prostitution charges were a “political frame-up” related to his “support of former President Clinton”. “At the time, I believed he was telling me the truth,” he said.Gender studies brought a critical lens to the biological determinism Trump invokesA few years later, in 2015, Ross wrote to Epstein again after another investigation into the pedophile. “I reached out to him to show support,” Ross said in a statement, adding: “That was a terrible mistake of judgment. When the reality of his crimes became clear, I was mortified and remain ashamed that I fell for his lies.”Despite his view that it was his “job” to befriend people like Epstein, there is still an incredible arrogance, a sense of absolute entitlement in his comments to Epstein, an implicit retort to the accusations and shaming of #MeToo.We don’t need to find incriminating evidence about Trump in the Epstein files to know where he stands with the Epstein cohort on the relationship between the sexes. The executive order, for all that it refrains from “locker-room talk”, is of a piece with Trump’s other utterances and is enough to make him fit in with the people in Epstein’s orbit.Powerful men exchanging women and girls for their pleasure is the underlying premise of the executive order, however much it proclaims its interest to be the defense of women’s “intimate spaces” and “their dignity, safety, and well-being”. What’s really at stake is the enforcement of “sex-based distinctions” that have long been understood hierarchically (men on top) to deny women (and sexual minorities) equality of treatment and access to resources and power. (“Equality” is a word notably lacking in the executive order.)Gender studies – feminist-initiated scholarly programs in schools and universities across the country – brought a critical lens to the biological determinism Trump invokes. And this critical lens extends to revealing how gender hierarchies enable the kind ofabusesthat some men in Epstein’s circle seemingly believed they had the right to commit. It educated generations of young women (and men) about the complexities of sex-based identity; explored the ways in which arguments for the “truth” of biological determination differed across societies and cultures; and used the findings of history, anthropology and psychology to better understand how gender norms underlay social and political organization.The suppression of gender studies is not only an attempt to suppress a critical analytical tool, but also knowledge itself. Witness the removal of any mention of slavery from Philadelphia’s Independence Mall, or the erasure of the vocabulary of diversity and inclusion from university mission statements. The impunity that surrounded Epstein is of a piece with the overt misogyny and racism of these actions.Trump’s executive order claims that “the erasure of sex in language and policy has a corrosive impact not just on women but on the validity of the entire American system”. A system, gender studies teaches us, that is based (in his case) on a politics of masculine rule.Genderstudies is not an “ideology”, but a critical tool for examining – in the case of Trump and Epstein – the predations of toxic masculinity.Abolishing those programs and the lessons about gender they have taught, will, Trump and his acolytes hope, undermine our ability not just to condemn, but also to critically analyze the policies and practices they want to impose. That is why a defense of gender studies is not a parochial feminist project, but a vital stand that extends to the “validity of the entire American system” as a democracy, one based on aspirations for equality and justice for all.Joan Wallach Scott is professor emerita at the Institute for Advanced StudyExplore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinOpinionGenderUS universitiesHigher educationUS educationWomenRacecommentShareReuse this content"

Though, as the Epstein files reveal daily, the top 0.01% were hardly primly biting their tongues before Trump’s win, at least not in private. Those with telephone-number fortunes and great power felt able to speak, and write, to each other about womenin language so vicious, so filled with hate – women discussed as body parts, as “less than human”, inGordon Brown’s apt phrase– that they didn’t need the encouragement of a “grab ’em by the pussy” president to cast off their inhibitions.Still, as that unnamed banker made clear to the FT, women are not the only group the powerful and privileged have been itching to disparage. This week it was migrants who were the target, accused by the billionaire Monaco resident Sir Jim Ratcliffe of having“colonised”Britain.He may have got his stats wrong – he was in quite a muddle about the size of the UK population – but he did usefully debunk one stubbornly persistent assumption. For a while, it was taken as read that anti-immigrant sentiment was a function of economic anxiety: indeed, that was the instant explanation offered for Trump’s victory in 2016. But Ratcliffe, whose fortune is estimated at £17bn, won’t be feeling too much angst in the economic department. That is truer still of Elon Musk, who is simultaneously the backer of anti-immigration parties across Europe and the world’s richest man.Indeed, the data shows no correlation at all between hostility to immigration and income. In January,Ipsos found that it was the most affluent fifthof voters in Britain who, more than any other group, named immigration as their most pressing concern.The increasingly uninhibited musings of the super-rich are, alas, just one factor in a shift that is becoming ever more apparent. While of course we must say that Sir Jim’s comments did not specify the racial origins of immigrants, that’s inevitably how they were heard.We are, in the words of Sunder Katwala, who as the director of the British Future thinktank observes these trends more keenly than most,“going backwards on racism”.The evidence is all around you. It’s there in the116,000 hate crimes recorded by police in England and Wales, but excluding London, for the year to March 2025 – up on the previous year, and a fifth of it involving violence.It’s there in the “ugly”, 1970s-style racism directed at NHS staff, incidents of verbal and physical abuse based on skin colour so frequent that thehealth secretary, Wes Streeting, warned last Novemberthat it was becoming “socially acceptable to be racist”.It’s there in a changed public discourse, where the bounds of acceptability have shifted to include notions that most thought had been left behind two generations ago. Suddenly there’s a debate, drawing in mainstream commentators, overwhether Rishi Sunak is English. A former cabinet minister, Robert Jenrick, can lament not seeing“another white face”in a Birmingham neighbourhood. A former prime minister, Liz Truss, appears as a guest on an online show where she chats withConnor Tomlinson, who believes, among other things, that British citizens from ethnic minorities should not be allowed to become members of parliament. The Sun’s Harry Cole hosts that same far-right figure onhis online show.It’s there on social media, where it has become routine to hurl the P-word at politicians from the Tories’ Priti Patel to Labour’s Shabana Mahmood, from onetime Corbynite Zarah Sultana to Reform’s Zia Yusuf. And it’s there in the daily, lived experience of Britain’s minorities, measurable in both data and anecdote. Figuresreleased this week, for example, showed yet another rise in antisemitic incidents, including a spike straight after October’s deadly attack on a synagogue in Heaton Park, Manchester, which left two dead on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar – more than half of that spike made up of incidents directly referring to, orcelebrating, the killings at Heaton Park. Last autumn, Katwala wrote: “I personally get so much more racist abuse most weeks in 2025 than I ever did in 2005.”Of course, there will be multiple and varied explanations for all this, but there are a few common threads. When it comes to the discourse, the shaping effect of online influencers is unmistakable. The likes of Tomlinson would once have been handing out badly stencilled leaflets in pub backrooms. Now he can reach millions, with TV production values previously the exclusive preserve of the major broadcasters. But the medium affects the message.Put simply, the loudmouths of the far right are competing in an attention economy. Saying something shocking wins attention, but to keep it they have to say something more shocking still. There is a ratchet effect, which ensures the conversation becomes ever more extreme. Note the latest effusion from the white supremacist US influencer Nick Fuentes. Holocaust denial worked for him for a while, but his audience demands more. This week, he provided it by directing his fire at women, whom he castigated for encouraging sympathy for the poor and minorities.“The number one political enemy in America is women,”he told his audience on the Rumble platform. And so, “Every woman and girl is sent to the gulags. We will determine who the good ones are after the fact.” But first, to the gulags. “They go to the breeding gulags.”These figures should be far beyond the fringe, but they keep getting amplified. Tucker Carlson hosted Fuentes on his show; Musk regularly promotes some of Britain’s most extreme voices, including Advance UK, a political party that now includes Tommy Robinson and that vows to ban indefinite leave to remain, ban the foreign-born from becoming British citizens and encourage all settled migrants to leave. Musk seems to thinkAdvance is the real deal, preferable to the “weak sauce” of Nigel Farage. All the while, hisX platform barely stirsas users racially abuse others, in the foulest language.Throw in the brain-boiling effect of the pandemic period, when a small, extremely online minority became radicalised by conspiracy theories of every flavour, with anti-vax talk as the gateway drug, and you have some of the causes of this retrograde shift.It’s important to hold on to the fact that most people do not think this way, that attitudes of tolerance are now deeply embedded in Britain: the data shows that too. Still, that led too many to become complacent, to assume that this was a problem of our past, one that we’d solved. But racism and prejudice are not like that. The battles against them have to be fought, and re-fought, in every generation. They are light sleepers – and some loud, powerful voices are determined to shake them awake.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is worth underlining what the high court in London has todayruled to be unlawful: our government’s decision to place the direct-action group Palestine Action on the same legal footing as al-Qaida and Islamic State. Legally speaking, simply showing support for it risked a jail sentence of up to 14 years. The consequences? More than2,700 people arrestedfor holding placards opposing genocide and supporting Palestine Action, many of them elderly, including a retired octogenarian priest.No one who engages in criminal damage for a political cause imagines they will avoid arrest. As the court ruling makes clear, normal criminal law remains available for such acts. But when a government applies the badge of “terrorism” to movements that, however disorderly, are clearly not terrorist movements, an alarming precedent is set. As the court recognised, the proscription interferes with rights to freedom of expression, to peaceful assembly and free associations with others. You do not need a fevered imagination to see how a future Reform UK government could build on such a precedent. (As things stand, the ban on the group remains in effect so the government has time to appeal.)10:35Owen Jones on Palestine Action high court win | The LatestThe judges’ ruling did argue that Palestine Action’s adoption of direct action goes beyond civil disobedience. That’s because it seeks to damage property – primarily, to destroy equipment belonging to the Israeli arms manufacturerElbit Systems. Well, fine, but then the suffragettes weren’t a civil disobedience movement either. Today, they are secular saints, lauded by some of the same MPs who voted to proscribe Palestine Action, even though their tactics were far more extreme. Let’s not forget, the suffragettes planted bombs, burned down private homes and even killed people.History’s judgment on that movement is clear: the greater crime was the disenfranchisement of women. Their actions are seen through that prism.In this case, aUN independent commission, genocide scholars and NGOs ranging fromAmnesty Internationalto Médecins Sans Frontières have concluded that Israel has committed genocide against the Palestinian people. The international criminal court (ICC) – of which the UK is a founding member – long agoissued arrest warrantsfor Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former defence minister for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. Britain supplies crucial components for Israel’s fighter jets,shares intelligenceand permits itscitizens to fightin Israel’s army.In the abstract, how would a reasonable person respond if asked: “If you have strong grounds to conclude that your own government is facilitating genocide – the crime of crimes – should you do whatever it takes to stop it, even if that means breaking the law?” That is undoubtedly a question English juries have wrestled with, because they have repeatedly acquittedPalestine Actionactivists hauled before the court. No wonder the government wants to curb trial by jury.Our home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has declared that she will “fight” the judgment in the court of appeal. It is worth noting that according to his published correspondence with Peter Mandelson, Mahmood’s cabinet colleague Wes Streeting declared last year: “Israel is committing war crimes before our eyes.” Moreover, more than a decade ago, Mahmood was marching against an Israeli onslaught against Gaza which – however horrific – was not anywhere near the scale of the current genocide.It stretches incredulity to believe that Mahmood does not share Streeting’s conclusion that Israel has committed war crimes, because denying that is like subscribing to flat-Earthism. The British government refuses to state the obvious because that would impose legal obligations on it. For a start, it would not be lawful to supply the crucial components of fighter jets to a state committing war crimes. That’s why the thenforeign secretary backtrackedlast year when he described Israel’s blockade of Gaza as what it is: a violation of international law.In sum, smashing up the equipment of an Israeli arms manufacturer isn’t lawful – but neither is arming a state committing war crimes, and indeed genocide. Which should we treat as the most serious?Let’s be clear: if the Palestine Action hunger strikers die, the government will bear moral responsibility | George MonbiotRead moreThere is one major question to be answered. After Palestine Action vandalised Donald Trump’s Turnberry golf resort in Scotland in March 2025 – before the group was proscribed–the president described them as “terrorists” and expressed hope they would be “treated harshly”. We also know thatTrump discussedPalestine Action twice with our prime minister. The contents of that conversation must be revealed to establish whether proscription was discussed.That only 26 MPsvoted againstthis unlawful legislation tells you everything you need to know about our soulless, cowardly political establishment. But those who have facilitated genocide should begin to panic. The suffragettes, alas, did not have court rulings in their favour at the time, and their cause was – however absurdly – controversial. Women did not receive the vote in full until 1928, and the suffragettes’ canonisation came decades later.But polling shows that the British public believes Israel’s attack on Gaza wasnot justified, supports anarms embargoand sanctions against Israel, andsupports the arrestof Netanyahu. Polling in the US shows thathalf of Americansbelieve Israel has committed genocide, with just over a third disagreeing. That the ICC issued arrest warrants despite colossal western pressure is another sign of where this all leads.It is obvious that Israel’s genocide will be remembered as one of the great crimes of our age. Those complicit will be damned by history, and may one day find themselves hauled before the courts. Those who were arrested for holding placards will be vindicated as courageous fighters against the worst crime that can possibly exist. Whether Mahmood wins or loses her appeal, that reckoning is coming.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

However, the men did not react with rage but with discipline. They continued their prayers even as officers approached. There were no fists raised, no retaliation, and no chaos; instead, there was the quiet continuity of a ritual that once begun could not be abandoned.For observant Muslims, the moment of prostration – forehead to ground – is symbolically considered the closest proximity to God. It’s a posture of complete vulnerability with the body lowered, ego surrendered, and the world shut out. The ritual prayer is considered to be the foundation ofIslam. This made the footage profoundly confronting for many Muslim Australians. Interrupting someone at their most defenceless position isn’t just moving a body; it’s intruding upon an intimate act of surrender.The events of that day will undoubtedly be debated in terms of law and public order. However, before those arguments begin, it’s worth understanding what many Muslim Australians were watching and why it felt like more than a policing incident.In a country that insists it protects freedom of religion, the sight of worshippers seized mid-prayer carries symbolic weight.1:18Police disrupt praying Muslims during protests in Sydney – videoThe NSW police commissioner, Mal Lanyon, confirmed he contacted senior Muslim community leaders and offered an apology for any offence caused by officers disrupting prayers. However,the premier, Chris Minns, declined to issue a public apology,defending the police response as appropriate given the tense and fast-moving situation.However, when an incident occurs in full public view and has a wider impact than just a small group of representatives, private outreach alone isn’t sufficient. A public incident warrants public acknowledgment.A public apology is not about politics or humiliation: it’s about recognition.The images were seen by families at home, young Muslims grappling with their sense of belonging, and a community questioning whether their dignity is protected alongside everyone else’s. Public acknowledgment affirms their equal place in the national narrative.When the state misjudges what is reasonable, leadership involves owning that mistake. Leadership is also about empathy and restraint, especially during high-tension situations.Police operate in tense environments and must make rapid decisions. But force is never neutral. For many Muslim Australians, the images from Sydney did not occur in a vacuum. They landed in a community shaped by two decades of securitisation: expanded surveillance, loyalty tests, and a persistent framing of Muslim civic life as a security question. After the horrific terror attack on 14 December at Bondi beach, Muslim Australians again felt the familiar surge of collective suspicion. In that context, the physical handling of men at prayer is not merely an operational detail. It resonates and ricochets.Seven of my relatives were killed in Gaza. For me, Herzog’s visit was never an abstract debate | Shamikh BadraRead moreThere is a harder truth beneath this week’s events. Political leaders have sometimes spoken as though solidarity is finite, as though recognisingIslamophobiadiminishes concern about antisemitism. That logic invites a competition of grief. It fragments the public into rival claimants for empathy and protection under the law.An apology would not solve everything. But it would interrupt a dangerous narrative spiral.Resentment is not theatrical outrage; it is a sedimented experience. It accumulates in classrooms when children are asked to explain geopolitics. It accumulates in workplaces where “jokes” about terrorism pass as banter. It accumulates when grief expressed by Muslims is framed as volatility rather than equality and citizenship.Refusing to apologise may yield short-term political advantage. It signals toughness and being resolute and clear. But toughness without introspection is brittle. Long-term trust depends on demonstrating that state power can be corrected as well as asserted.A serious response now requires an independent inquiry empowered to examine operational choices, command structures, and proportional use of force. Transparency is the minimum condition of legitimacy and the rebuilding of community trust. It also requires meaningful engagement with Muslim community leaders and grassroots organisers. Not curated photo opportunities or closed-door apologies to a few.The question should not be how to manage anger. It should be how to address the conditions that produce it. An often recited saying among Muslims, attributed to the prophet Muhammad, is: “The strong person is not the one who overpowers others, but the one who controls himself in anger.”Finally, there must be a broader reckoning with Islamophobia in Australia. It is too convenient to treat each incident as discrete. Islamophobia operates not only as interpersonal prejudice but as a policy lens, a media reflex, a security grammar that casts Muslim civic presence as conditional. Multiculturalism cannot be sustained as a celebration of cuisine and costume while sidestepping accountability.Australia prides itself on being a successful multicultural society.That reputation depends on the consistency of principle and rule of law.Aftab Malik is Australia’s special envoy to combat IslamophobiaExplore more on these topicsProtestOpinionIslamIslamophobiaReligionNew South WalesFreedom of speechNew South Wales politicscommentShareReuse this content"

This is no way to progress a humane migration debateFri 13 Feb 2026 08.42 ESTLast modified on Fri 13 Feb 2026 09.50 ESTShareHas Britain been colonised by immigrants? That is what the Manchester United co-ownerJim Ratcliffe claimedin an interview with Sky News. He later said that he was sorry that his “choice of language has offended some people”, saying that what he had intended was to talk about how to control and manage immigration to promote growth.While Ratcliffe did not define the immigrants by race, to talk about Britain being “colonised” will inevitably be heard that way by many people. After all, the fact that Britain is a multiethnic and multifaith society today reflects the imperial and post-imperial history of Britain colonising much of Africa, and south and south-east Asia – and of postwar immigration from colonies and newly independent Commonwealth states.In 2026, remember this: Britain is much better than it was in so many ways. Don’t swallow the right’s lies | John HarrisRead moreThat is reinforced by the dramatic shift in post-2020 immigration. The large European inflows from 2004 to 2016 have fallen tonegative net migration flowsfor the year ended July 2025 and been replaced by a much biggerincreaseof immigration from outside the EU.What changed after the pandemic was not just record levels of immigration, but a different, more ethnically diverse – less white – composition of migrants than the pre-Brexit mix. According todata, the most common countries of nationality of those who arrived between 2021 and 2024 (pre-settlement) were India, Nigeria and Pakistan.So it is unsurprising that anti-racism group Kick It Out found the language unacceptable. This is why Manchester United’s statement distancing themselves from their co-owner – “our diverse group of players, staff and global community of supporters reflect the history and heritage of Manchester, a city that anybody can call home” – emphasised anti-racism as part of its broader commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion.The complex story of empire and post-imperial Britain is central to explaining who we now are – and the multiethnic society that we have become. As the British-born child of migrants – a doctor from India and a nurse from Ireland, who met while working in the NHS – it felt obvious to me from a young age that this country’s history had quite a lot to do with how our country was today.That is why for me, and probably many other ethnic-minority Britons, Ratcliffe’s choice of words echoes Enoch Powell’s“rivers of blood” argument– made in a speech just a week before my dad arrived here from Gujarat – that “the black man will have the whip hand over the white man”.Powell wanted the Commonwealth migrants of the post-Windrush era to go back home because, he argued, it would become a matter of national suicide if they had children here. So the birth of people such as me – or Rishi Sunak, or Shabana Mahmood – would be one more stick on the funeral pyre. According to Powell, we could never be British, whatever our passports said.Talking today of Britain being “colonised”’ by immigrants fuses that Powellite fear with the newer US import of the “great replacement theory”,which sees immigration as an elite plot to replace the majority white group.We have seen this invoked in the Trump administration’s warnings of “civilisational erasure” in Europe, or the claims of the racist right that London, Birmingham and Manchester have been “lost” to lawless migrant communities.This zero-sum argument suggests that the very presence, at scale, of minorities represents the subjugation of the white British majority. It is voiced by those promoting radicalised fantasies that mass “remigration” could still reverse the last half-century of change in our society.Politicians often talk about “legitimate concerns” about immigration. It can be a clunky phrase, but it is an important one. Arguments about getting the policies and numbers right are part of difficult but important democratic debate. A common-sense test of where to draw that line is to talk about immigration in ways that make sense to white, black and Asian Britons alike. Talking about “colonisation” fails that test.The half-hearted non-apology he has issued does not go far enough: he should disown the inflammatory language of colonisation. There is a very important difference between a democratic debate about immigration and efforts to weaponise it against migrants.Jim Ratcliffeneeds to concede that he has crossed that line.Sunder Katwala is director of British FutureDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

On Monday, the parliamentaryLabourparty reacted as it should when its leader hit a spot of bother. It knew it could not sack him, so it backed him. The constitution did its job and parliament supported the elected government of the day.The idea that what Britain most needs is a Downing Street conflict is madness. After a week of a truly almighty storm in a teacup, it was a relief that the Commons could recover and steady the ship of state. It should keep it that way into the immediate future.The cliche of the week was that the country stared into the abyss and drew back. If that was true, then Keir Starmer deserves a gold medal for hisperformance on Monday night. While he quietened the party mob, cooler heads were also calming the cabinet. A better cliche is that a week is a long time in politics. The storm has subsided, leaving disappointed commentators muttering: “It’s still not if, but when.”The reason for the prime minister’s troubles is by now well rehearsed. He appointed aman who he knew to have dodgy friendsto the Washington embassy and had to get rid of him. This is only one among Labour’s many U-turns, which also include on benefits for disabled people, the winter fuel allowance for pensioners, inheritance tax, pubs and the rest. Mandelson has gone and further investigations are a matter for the police.The reality was that this was exactly the sort of story Britain’s hot-house politics loves: a US president, a British royal, sexual abuse, misogyny and stupefying wealth. The papers could keep it bubbling with juicy facts day after day. The 24/7 media went crazy. It could forget boring government and its issues. Yes, of course the story at root involved a disgrace, but Westminster flicks a switch and turns disgrace into national scandal. All sense of proportion vanishes.Britain’s prime minister has been in power for less than two years. He has struggled with his central mission, which is to get the nation’s public finances into shape. He has not yet succeeded – but nor has he failed. There have been numerous mistakes. Starmer appointed a politically inept chancellor and failed to censor her£40bn tax rise. He had to move his foreign secretary, his home secretary and histop Downing Street teaminside a year. In the Commons he has suffered the well-known danger of a large majority, which is for it to become uncontrollable.These errors were proportionally far worse for his party and the country than was the Mandelson affair. Clearly a large number of Labour MPs feel Starmer’s qualities are not suited to the post. But then they chose him – as he chose Mandelson. They must have known his limitations.The primary public interest in the government just now is stability. The only conceivable virtue in a coup against Starmer is that it would bring in a regime stronger, more purposeful and more appealing to the electorate. None of the normally listed options passes that test. Wes Streeting has yet to prove himself a reformer of the NHS. Angela Rayner is hardly a unifier. Andy Burnham is not even in parliament.Plenty of prime ministers have survived attempts to topple them. They are surrounded by rivals who went into politics hoping they might end up in Downing Street. Gordon Brownfaced a leadership challenge from James Purnell.John Major had to resign as party leader mid-term and fight for re-election. Thatcher endured a long-running revolt from “wets” within her cabinet.Britain has been through a decade of chaos at the apex of its politics. Its economy has needed a steady hand, not one under constant insecurity and challenge. Abroad, the past year has been dominated by turbulent events in Washington and elsewhere. Starmer has performed throughout with dignity. He has held Britain’s customary position as intermediary between Europe and the US. There is no public interest in undermining him.Starmer’s next challenge will be the forthcomingGorton and Denton byelection, followed by the May local elections and the ongoing march of the Greens and Reform UK. His job is to rise above these crises, not succumb to them. Many Labour MPs are new and understandably fear for their seats. But they must know that unseating Starmer is unlikely to make them safer.The 2024 election was supposedly a relief after voters had lived through five prime ministers in a decade. Now to gamble on a sixth cannot make sense. The only winners would be the populist parties of the right and left, and the nationalist fringe. Is that really what the Labour party wants?Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist and the author ofA Short History of America: From Tea Party to TrumpExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourPeter MandelsoncommentShareReuse this content"

If it’s new Puritans versus liberal cavaliers, I know which side I’m onRavi Holy is the vicar of Wye in Kent and a standup comedianFri 13 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 13 Feb 2026 11.09 ESTShareIposted a rave review of the new Sam Raimi film, Send Help,the other dayand triggered a debate I didn’t expect: is it OK for Christians to watch horror films? Send Help – a “gore-laced plane-crash survival face-off”,according to the Guardian review(which was less kind than mine) – is more comedy-horror than horror, or maybe horror/thriller. But there’s definitely horror there – you get the point.The most extreme response was the man who said that not only are horror movies verboten, Christians shouldn’t even watch soap operas. So, for him, Emmerdale is as bad as The Exorcist – which itself seems a bizarre film to rule out, given its hero is a priest. Who rediscovers his faith after an encounter with evil. Which he wins. I call that a positive religious message.Of course, I can see why some of the language and the projectile vomiting might be too much for the more sensitive viewer, and I wouldn’t show it to the church youth group. But then I wouldn’t show them Saving Private Ryan either – and Ihaveused a clip from The Exorcist to introduce a serious discussion (with adults) on faith and doubt.I hadn’t encountered this kind of radical neo-puritanism for many years, but it was still very much a thing in the 1990s. At that time, I went to a Pentecostal church in west London and, within a few months of arriving there, was persuaded to throw away my record collection, which was full of the unholy trinity of AC/DC, Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin. I later regretted this but would probably have re-bought them all on CD anyway so, no real harm done.I also avoided certain films then – in particular,Oliver Stone’s The Doorsand anything that had occult overtones – but I never boycotted the cinema altogether and nor did anyone else in my church. However, one of my fellow street preachers in Leicester Square was horrified when, having completed my shift, I announced that I was off to watch Terminator 2. “Christians shouldn’t go to the cinema,” he said with withering disapproval. “What would you do if Jesus came back while you were in there rather than out here preaching the Gospel?”I didn’t bother pointing out that the subtitle of the film was “Judgment Day”, and anyway, the tragic irony is that it has since emerged much worse things were happening withinthe Jesus Army, the organisation to which he belonged. So not only would he have done better to look at the plank in his own eye before commenting on the speck in mine, he might have also considered Jesus’s other comment about peoplewho strain out gnats only to swallow a camel.View image in fullscreen‘One man told me that Christians shouldn’t even watch soap operas. So, for him, Emmerdale is as bad as The Exorcist.’Photograph: Helen Turton/PAAnd that, for me, is the problem with neo-puritanism: it focuses on the wrong things. AsRichard Holloway, the former primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church, put it: “God is much more concerned about what’s happening in our boardrooms than in our bedrooms.”Consider theGeneral Synodthis week in my own church, the Church of England. Nearly 13 years after same-sex marriage was legalised in the UK, the big issue for this synod is whether we can even say prayers for gay and lesbian couples in standalone services – to which the answer from some quarters is still a resounding “no”. They are righteously indignant about all the wrong things.The English civil wars may have ended in 1651 but there is still a cold war being waged between contemporary Puritans and liberal cavaliers such as me. At its root are two radically different theological visions. For my friend who won’t even watch EastEnders, the world is an irredeemably sinful place from which we need to be rescued – like Noah and his ark. And just as God (supposedly) wiped out the vast majority of life on Earth in the flood, it doesn’t really matter if we destroy the planet now because it’s only the next world that matters anyway. People at my old church literally said that without shame.Fortunately, the other paradigm is more dominant today. This prioritises the first chapter of Genesis – in which God looks at creation and declares it to be “very good” – over the later, disastrously wetter, flood narrative. Jesus famously welcomed so-called sinners rather than shunning them as a Puritan would do. With that beard and long hair, he evenlookedlike a cavalier.I’d love to see all Christians adopting the view taken by Ernest Hemingway, whom Morgan Freeman quotes at the end of that othergreat horror/thriller Se7en: “The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.” Yes, everything is beautiful: horror films, rock music, Emmerdale – in its way, all of it.Ravi Holy is the vicar of Wye in Kent and a standup comedianExplore more on these topicsChristianityOpinionAnglicanismHorror filmsThrillersReligioncommentShareReuse this content"

Votes at 16 is the start of a welcome changeFri 13 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 13 Feb 2026 11.08 ESTShareHere it is as promised, a billintroduced to parliament on Thursdayproposing to give the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds by the next general election. Good. The accusation from the Conservatives and Reform last year was thatthis was gerrymandering. “Rank hypocrisy” says the Sun. If polls had shown that the young traditionally swing to the right, would Labour have espoused this? I don’t know.Nigel Farage’s claim that the young are turning to him is largely overblown,according to YouGov polling, with only 9% of 18 to 24-year-olds saying they would vote Reform – no better than what Ukip achieved in 2015. However there is agender gap, says More in Common, with boysnearly twice as likelyto support parties on the right. The Tories, who will lose out, search for reasons to oppose the bill and come up with some rum arguments. I particularly enjoyedClaire Coutinho’s concernthat young people do not need the “added pressure” of deciding whether to focus on their exams or “stay up to watch” political debates, as elections are often in the summer exam season.In power, the Tories went to great lengths to stop young people voting: David Cameron’s government barred colleges and universities fromregistering students automatically. Meanwhile, parents were barred from registering young people at home, so students’ vote depended on their personal determination to register, at a time of turmoil in their lives – and frequent address changing. It worked, with young people thelargest disenfranchised group.The age when people become more likely to switch to the right reached 66 at the last election. The 16- and 17-year-olds who will actually vote in the next general election are now aged 12-13, so candidates had better get to work on them. Yet the reality is that in our corrupted and perverse electoral system, the votes of these teenagers are highly unlikely to affect any seats: there are too few of them in any one seat to shift the dial even if they all voted for the same candidate, according toresearch by Christine Huebnerat the University of Sheffield, which is a shame. But expect to see candidates hastening to canvass in schools, not just old people’s homes – with promises to the young, not just the old.That’s why this matters. It should be a symbol and a signal of intent to focus policy on the young, who have lost out so badly in the austerity years – with education funding andSure Startcut, and the education maintenance allowance for poorer sixth formers abolished. Meanwhile, during Covid, the young were sacrificed in school closures to save the old from dying. As the old revel in triple-locked pensions and freedom passes regardless of income, families with children are the poorest.Much more should be done to ensure that the old whoarepoor claim their pension credit, but it is uphill work persuading the old as a cohort how privileged we have been all our lives: born into an NHS created for us, staying on longer in comprehensive schools, vast expansion of (free) universities and colleges, a time of massive housebuilding and public investment in libraries, leisure centres and sports. I once gave a talk on a cruise ship explaining to my generation how lucky we were compared with the young – and I feared I’d get thrown overboard in their fury. Look at the young with their lattes and avocado toast, they said; those lazy moaners and snowflakes – “we never had mobile phones in our day”. Politically, shifting significant resources and power from the old (who vote) to young (who don’t much) is risky.Why 16? David Runciman, a professor of politics at the University of Cambridge,suggests voting at age six, which I like. But it might be more politically saleable to give parents caring for children a double vote on their behalf to tilt the electoral arithmetic in a rapidly ageing population: thefertility ratein England and Wales fell to a record low in 2024, to 1.44 children per woman, when it takes 2.1 just to maintain the population. Innovation, rebellion, new ideas, trends and fashions rarely come from the old: stagnation and decay beckon if nostalgia for a world 50 years ago dominates education policy. Even if there were every encouragement for parenthood – housing, free good nurseries, parenting subsidies and, above all, a sense of welcoming children – we would need to rethink attitudes towards welcoming young migrants to keep our population renewed. Jim Ratcliffe’s decrepit complaint about a Britain“colonised by immigrants”let Labour thump back with resounding repudiations.The young, of course, overwhelmingly back votes at 16, butthey are remarkably humble: in August 2025, 46% said they felt informed enough about politics to vote in a general election, while the same proportion said they did not feel informed enough (8% were unsure).They ought to know about the depths ofadult ignorance: the majority are disastrously wrong in their estimates on crime (78% ofpeople polledthink it’s rising when it fell 90% in the last three decades), benefits (many think most goes to the jobless when most goes to pensioners) or how incomes are distributed (extreme inequality is often grossly underestimated).A new school curriculum,out in 2027, will bring in the kind of citizenship education with critical thinking at its core taught brilliantly in some schools, but barely at all in most, killed off by Michael Gove when hedropped itfrom his Ebacc. Accompanying sixth formers to the polling station could give them a habit for life: this is a chance for them to become the most democratically minded generation.

Cue an authoritarian responseFri 13 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 13 Feb 2026 11.03 ESTShareIt must have seemed the easiest offer in the world to refuse. Would students at Bangor University enjoy a question-and-answer session with Sarah Pochin–the Reform UK MPfamous for sayingit “drives me mad” to see TV adverts full of black people – andJack Anderton, the 25-year-old influencer who helped send Nigel Farage’s TikTok account viral among teenagers? No, the university’s debating society decided, it would not.And had it filed the request in the bin, you wouldn’t be reading this. Until now, Anderton’s A New Dawn campus tour– a homage to the “debate me bro” style of the American rightwing activist Charlie Kirk,killed last year, who was famed for invitingliberal students to take on his arguments and live-streaming the results – hadn’t exactly set the heather alight. Reform is actively pushing to recruit inside universities, but in Cambridge, according to its student newspaper Varsity, only about 30 people turned up to hear Anderton argue that migrants are taking the part-time jobs students once used to do.The same was true in Exeter and York, according to their respective student papers Exposé and York Vision. And despite noisy counter-protests, the tour wasn’t juicing the kind of controversy that commands attention on YouTube, where the really big crowds are. (The Cambridge event livestream had a paltry 177 views when I checked.)So imagine how he must have felt when Bangor debating and politics society responded that “in line with our values” it was declining his offer, expressing “zero tolerance for any form of racism, transphobia or homophobia”.Finally, a proper no-platforming! (Though strictly speaking, he and Pochin were never actually given a platform of which to be stripped.) That’s worth more in terms of reach than trekking to Bangor on a wet February night to face a half-empty room. GB News and the Daily Telegraph weighed in. Reform’s Zia Yusufthundered on Xthat Bangor got £30m from taxpayers and he was “sure they won’t mind losing every penny of (their) state funding under a Reform government”. And that’s where it suddenly got serious.Threatening to put universities out of business – with all that would mean for students halfway through their degrees, or towns reliant on a major employer – if they don’t fawningly accommodate any regime-backed political nonentity who asks is the stuff of autocracy, not democracy. And the lesson from Donald Trump’s America, where pro-free speech Republicans have proved remarkably intolerant of people speaking against them, is that the pressure rarely stops there.What would stop the financial intimidation of a BBC reliant on the licence fee? What about charities and cultural or civic institutions receiving public grants, or newspapers with owners anxious to protect their other business interests, or schools? Though a Reform spokesperson later insisted Yusuf’s comments were “not party policy”, his literal job title is head of policy, and Reform has previously advocated removing at least some funding from universities that don’t protect free speech.Vice-chancellors have been criticised for quietlyseeking meetingswith Reform. But I’m not surprised they’re anxious to lobby a prospective prime minister who publicly accuses them of poisoning young people’s minds, and who they are told sees Trump’s crusade against “woke”Ivy League universitiesas a model.Academia is an obvious target for the populist right because it’s a classic wellspring of resistance: students are often first to the barricades and graduates are more likely to hold socially liberal views than people who left school at 18. But thefinancial crisisin England’s higher education system makes it unusually vulnerable to attack.Some smaller institutions have already been brought to the financial brink by government curbs on foreign students, who pay higher fees than British students and have for years helped universities balance the books. If a Reform government pursuing close to zero immigration cuts student visas, it wouldn’t take much to tip some over the edge. (Ironically, among those most at risk might be smaller post-1992 institutions, some perhaps in Reform’s new heartlands.) Others would be in no position financially to resist political pressure. When Trumpfroze millions of dollarsof research funding to universities that had rebuffed his demands over admissions and hiring policy, the teaching of conservative ideas and policing of campus protests, only the richest institutions could afford to fight back through the courts. And while UK law offers some protection for universities’ autonomy in research and teaching, laws can always be repealed.That priceless academic freedom to think and explore what you like is, of course, a two-way street. Students must be willing to hear views they don’t like and learn how to argue back, a skill that matters more than ever now and is more safely acquired arguing face-to-face on campus than on social media.Pubs are for everyone. Don’t let Reform make them the political property of the boorish hard right | Jonathan LiewRead moreBut the current crop of students is perhaps sturdier than popular myth would have you think. Recent research at the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) found69% of studentsfelt universities should never limit free speech, up from 60% in 2016. (Though admittedly Hepi also found a third favoured banning Reform speakers from campus and another 16% wanted Labour speakers banned, students showed a confusing tendency to advocate banning parties they had actually voted for. Have some just had enough of hearing from politicians?) After years of Conservative measures to promote free speech on campus, almost half of universities surveyed by the umbrella body Universities UK thought students did now understand better what that meant. What the Bangor affair underlines, however, is that the right to free speech isn’t the same as the right to a free audience whenever you happen to be campaigning in the neighbourhood; and that whatever you have to say, you can’t actively make people want to listen.Anderton’s tour has now successfully visited five universities and is due in Edinburgh – where a previous event was cancelled by the venue – this evening. But crucially in each of these universities he was invited in, often by interested rightwing student societies. In Bangor, by contrast, he asked for a slot but got no takers.Whatever you think of his Maga ideology, Kirk undeniably turned nerdy political debate into a kind of compelling gladiatorial spectator sport that spawned viral imitators on both sides of the political aisle, perhaps even helping confound the myth that young people can’t manage intellectual confrontation. What Anderton – whose value to Reform is his ability to jump on to gen-Z trends faster than cautious mainstream parties do – may be learning is that that isn’t as easy as Kirk made it look.In this country, it turns out politicians still have to actually earn a hearing, not compel one. Well, that’s freedom for you.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistGuardian Newsroom: Can Labour come back from the brink?On Monday 30 April, ahead of May elections, join Gaby Hinsliff, Zoe Williams, Polly Toynbee and Rafael Behr as they discuss how much of a threat Labour faces from the Green party and Reform – and whether Keir Starmer can survive as leader of the Labour partyBook ticketshereExplore more on these topicsReform UKOpinionUniversitiesWalescommentShareReuse this content"

Instead it has filled the city with gaudy pavilions and gentrificationFri 13 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 13 Feb 2026 02.36 ESTShareOn a bad day, Milan can feel less like a city than an open-air shopping mall. Since winning the bid to host theWinter Olympicsin 2019, the urban landscape has been flattened into construction dust and swamped in corporate messaging. What started as a logo on a tram has gradually evolved into a feverish, full-scale takeover of the public realm. From Piazza del Duomo to the Sforzesco Castle, the city’s most popular spaces have been appropriated by gaudy pavilions, turning Milan into a bizarre spectacle staffed by dancing mascots.Last Friday, I sat down with friends to watch the opening ceremony, broadcast live from the San Siro, the much-loved brutalist football stadium that has beenslated for demolitionThe reaction in the room was telling. On the one hand, after so much buildup, most people were excited the big moment had finally arrived. But as the proceedings went on and the parade of familiar faces gave way to the peculiar sight of bobble-headed puppets of Rossini, Puccini and Verdi dancing to Italo disco hit Vamos a la playa, the melancholy kicked in. Was this really what these years of disruption had been for? Was this strange, kitsch pop concert worth all thepolitical repression, the public inconvenience, the relentless marketing, the unspecified millions of euros in cost?Marco Balich, the creative mind behind the ceremony, spoke of his ambition to blend traditional Alpine imagery with Milanese modernity to showcase “Italian excellence”. In practice, it was hard to see the alchemy. What we saw was a generic stitching-together of nationaldolce vitastereotypes that did nothing to showcase the pluralistic voices defining the country’s shifting cultural frontiers. Even the Tunisian-Italian rapper Ghali, arguably the most vital artist on the bill, felt like a lonely representative of a multicultural Milan the organisers didn’t actually want to engage with. No wonder he appeared so unenthused in his performance. This was painting by numbers: a manufactured image that had little to do with the social realities ofItaly.Inevitably, people have been expressing their frustration in the streets. Since the Games began, thousands havecome out in protest: against ICE, Trump and Israel, but also, with a more local focus, against the commodification of once-public city spaces. Activists have likened the economic philosophy behind Milano Cortina 2026 to the city’s 2015 Expo, a trade fair that politicians once promised would be an “urban salvation” but instead delivered monstrous public waste and rampant gentrification. Around Porta Romana, where the Olympic Village is located,property prices have soaredtomore than triplethenational average. If Milan’s elite once prided itself on fostering social mobility, the municipality is now unashamedly pricing out the very workers who were supposed to benefit from that ethos.It’s true that these problems are sadly common for host cities of major sporting events, but it’s especially galling given that Italy has proven it can do better. During the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, local organisers made a concerted effort to weave the competition into the city’s existing cultural fabric. While far from perfect, the Games were accompanied by a genuine sense of intellectual hospitality: late-night gallery openings, public debates and ambitious collaborations with the theatre world that prioritised mass participation over VIP access. Infrastructure was commissioned for the long-term, including the city’s first driverless metro, which has created a real legacy for residents rather than just a temporary stage for high-profile sponsors. Milan’s Winter Olympics, by contrast, feel less like an epochal moment in the city’s history and more like a passing trade fair.Meanwhile, in the nearby mountains where most of the outdoor events are taking place, the extractive logic behind the spectacle is even clearer. Residents of these areas say they have been sidelined throughout a process that feels more like an occupation than a sporting competition. In the Dolemite town of Cortina, local life has been scarred by an intensive infrastructure expansion they never asked for: the town is being hollowed out to accommodate a luxury-only tourism model, with the Games as the inciting incident. In practice, this means historic family-run businesses are being forced to compete with sterile high-end hotels and restaurants that will sit empty for most of the year. In Bormio, another small Alpine village hosting high-profile skiing events, the community has been obliged to live alongside a vast security mission that includes snipers on mountain ridges, and a mandatory system of road checkpoints that treats residents like terrorist suspects.Worst of all is the treatment of the Ladin people, an ancient ethnic and linguistic minority of roughly 35,000 people who have called the Dolomites home for more than 2,000 years. While the organisers have paid lip service to their culture for promotional cartoons and folkloric ornaments in the Games’ pageantry, the community has been granted no real representation on the planning committees and no authority in coordinating logistics. In January, Ladin mayors from 17 towns published anopen letterexplicitly accusing the organisers of “cutting them out” of proceedings and rebranding their heritage without consent. Some community leaders have gone even further, using the Games’ visibility to reissue a longstanding demand forsemi-autonomous status.At the dawn of this venture, the Olympic organisers promised they would link Italy’s financial capital with the mountains around it like never before. Unfortunately, the Games only highlight how incompatible the two worlds have become. A few weeks ago, I went to see a Cultural Olympiad exhibit called White Out at Milan’s Triennale, exploring the disappearance of snow from the Dolomites in the age of climate crisis. Walking through the minimalist gallery surrounded by smartly dressed art folk, past the logos of the oil and gas giant ENI and other fossil fuel sponsors, I felt like a protagonist in one of the surrealist author Dino Buzzati’s more disconcerting fictions. The fact that, just a few hours to the north, construction workers hadfelled an ancient larch forestto build a€120m (£105m) bobsled trackseemed far from anyone’s minds.The Winter Olympics should be about humanity, culture and, most of all, the collective enjoyment of sport. With these Games, Italy has been left to settle for a glitzy performance that speaks to no real public at all. Milan, one of Europe’s most culturally exciting cities, has had scant opportunities to share its genuine talent with the world. The Dolomites, home to Italy’s most beautiful ecosystems, have been reduced to a luxury simulacrum of themselves, at the expense of longstanding rural communities. As the athletes continue to dazzle with their skill, it’s impossible not to admire the sportsmanship. What a pity that the organisers have so tarnished the occasion by exploiting the very hospitality on which a successful Games depends.Jamie Mackay is a writer and translator based in FlorenceExplore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026OpinionWinter OlympicsItalyEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Nearly a century later, the BBC World Service, as it is now known,broadcasts in 43 languages, reaches 313 million people a weekand is one of the UK’s most influential cultural assets. It is also a lifeline for millions.“Perhaps Britain’s greatest gift to the world”in the 20th century, as Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general, once put it.But this week Tim Davie, the corporation’s director general,announcedthat the World Service will run out of funding in just seven weeks. Most of its£400mbudget comes from the licence fee, although the Foreign Office – which funded it entirely until 2014 –contributed £137m in the last year. The funding arrangement with the Foreign Office finishes at the end of March. There is no plan for what happens next.Meanwhile, Russia and China are pouring billions into state-run media. And American news organisations are crumbling under the Trump administration. Last weekthe Washington Postaxed 300 jobs including its Ukraine reporter, and hundreds were lost atVoice of America, the closest US equivalent to the BBC, last year.Although some question why licence-fee payers should subsidise services largely consumed abroad, it is also loved by many at home. In the small hours, it is a window on a dark world, an alternative to doomscrolling and a pushback against parochialism. Jeremy Paxmansummed it upwhen he compared the World Service to a cords- and cardigan-wearing “ageing uncle who’s seen it all. It has a style that makes understatement seem like flamboyance”. But we should not allow this cosy, slightly fusty image to obscure its purpose.For many it is not just life-enhancing, but life‑saving. Last month, during the internet blackout in Iran, the BBC’s Persian service providedadditional radio programmes over shortwave and medium wave. Emergency services were also launched in response to conflicts inUkraine, Syria, Gaza andSudan, and after the earthquake inMyanmar. It remains the only international news organisation still broadcasting inside Afghanistan, setting up an education programme forAfghan childrenin 2024.But it has been beleaguered by cuts, closures andjob losses. In 2022, radio broadcasts in 10 languages including Arabic, Persian, Chinese and Bengali werereplacedby digital services, a decisioncriticisedfor disproportionately affecting women, who rely most on radios. Wherever the BBC has been forced to withdraw – for financial or political pressures – propaganda has been quick to fill the gap.No one doubts the World Service’s value as an instrument of soft power. But, as BBC bossesargue, it is also part of our national security. Accurate journalism is the strongest weapon in the war of information. The World Service must not be allowed to stumble into decline. Mr Davie is right – if optimistic – to urge the government to back it decisively and urgently.During the second world war, radio was “scattering human voices into the darkness of Europe”,Penelope Fitzgeraldwrote in her 1980 novel Human Voices, based on her time working for the BBC. Amid the AI noise and disinformation, the World Service must be enabled to keep scattering human voices in our own dark times.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

So many tourists he picks up want to talk about the hit comedy and, as a fan himself, he’s happy to oblige.We’re stuck in traffic, which is odd for this small city on a wet Tuesday morning. “It’s because all the media are here,” he jokes. But there is some truth to it. I’m visiting for the world premiere of How to Get to Heaven fromBelfast, the new series from Derry Girls mastermind Lisa McGee, and to see how the capital became home to the best TV.It’s a big week: as well as McGee’s event, Michael Flatley isin courtsecuring an injunction to ensure the Lord of the Dance 30th anniversary show goes ahead. There’s also a huge buzz around another award-winning locally made show. “Blue Lights has just started filming down the road!” says Melanie Harrison, owner of the Harrison hotel where I’m staying and, like most people I meet on this trip, a true raconteur. Michael Smiley, who stars in the beloved cop drama, regularly stays at the hotel, but he’s now shooting a film with Brad Pitt in Ireland. “If Brad needs accommodation for the night, I’d be happy to have him,” she laughs. He’d be in great company – Zadie Smith recently stayed, as did Siobhán McSweeneyand Bronagh Gallagher. Adrian Dunbar was also heard crooning in the bar during the wee hours.View image in fullscreenJamie Dornan and Brian Milligan in The Fall.Photograph: Everett Collection/AlamyHarrison knows everything about the area’s arts scene; she puts on live operas, poetry readings and art exhibitions in the hotel’s rooms, which are themed on icons linked to the city, from CS Lewis to Angela Lansbury (“Her mum lived around the corner!”). She has seen the rise of homegrown telly first-hand, with local lad Jamie Dornan having filmed The Fall near her doorstep over a decade ago – and she has even become a part of it. Oscar-winner Christoph Waltz shot the opening scene for his film Old Guy in one of her hotel’s rooms, and a dead body was found in one of the suite’s roll-top baths in Channel 5’s drama Murder Most Puzzling.Blue Lightseven asked to film a club scene in the back bar, but guests were booked in. “People would have laughed at the idea of TV jobs in Belfast a few years ago,” says Harrison.That’s not the case now. McGee’s Bafta-winning sitcom put Derry on the global culture map, but parts were filmed in Belfast and its surrounding areas, helping the capital to become the heart of Northern Ireland’s TV renaissance. In the past few years it has boasted: Channel 4’s love-across-the-Troubles dramaTrespasses; Sky’s spiky romcomThe Lovers; the BBC’s adaptation of Sally Rooney’sConversations with Friends; ITV’s medical thrillerMalpractice; and HBO’s epic Game of Thrones prequelA Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. Line of Duty will also be produced here again when it returns after a hiatus. The brilliant Say Nothing, about Provisional IRA volunteer Dolours Price, was partly made in Belfast but it was mostly produced in Liverpool.View image in fullscreenNathan Braniff as Tommy in Blue Lights series three.Photograph: PHOTOGRAPHER:/CREDIT LINE:BBC/Two Cities TelevisionI board a culture bus tour of the city. A stop at the Seamus Heaney Centre proves the calibre of the city’s domestic TV storytellers: McGee, the Blue Lights creators Declan Lawn and Adam Patterson, and Trespasses writer Louise Kennedy have all been fellows. Catherine Grimes, a music supervisor who has worked with all three names, joins the tour. She left rural Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles in the 1980s and worked on shows such as Absolutely Fabulous and The Royle Family in London. After lockdown, Grimes was offered Blue Lights and she moved to Belfast. She is now responsible for the needle-drops in How to Get to Heaven from Belfast, calling McGee an “all-round gorgeous person” who is also a “very enthusiastic and knowledgable music fan”. The work just keeps coming.“I’d always been connected to the storytelling in the songs and literature of Northern Ireland,” she later tells me. “But to now be immersed on a daily basis in a reinvigorated, vibrant, exciting community which has universal stories to tell, influenced by its unique history, is a really full circle moment. I have a laugh literally every day. Northern Irish people have a quick wit and humour that can’t be beaten, despite our devastating past.”‘Wouldn’t it be lovely if I could shut up?’ Meet Lola Petticrew, TV’s most fearless actorRead moreThis boom in TV has been a long time coming.During the Troubles, many of the screen stories that focused on the conflict were regulated and censored. Take Play for Today: Carson Country in 1972, which was made in London and explored the roots of the Troubles. “Its transmission was delayed for several months on the grounds that it would be perceived as politically biased and might enflame the situation in Northern Ireland,” reportedmedia expert Prof John Hillin 2020. For another play in the same series two years later, titled The Dandelion Clock, reluctant staff and security risks meant production was pushed back to London. Yet as the landscape slowly developed, TV plays made in Belfast would help to show working-class life there: in the 80s, Graham Reid’s “Billy trilogy”, which launched the career of a young Kenneth Branagh, was watched by millions across the UK.Around the time of the 1998 Good Friday agreement, government-backed agencyNorthern Ireland Screenwas set up to attract international film and TV producers. More nuanced tellings of Northern Ireland started to emerge, along with that cracking humour – but sitcoms such as the satirical Give My Head Peace, which has been running for more than 30 years, never took off outside the country. “People weren’t interested,” recalls Grimes. “And people didn’t really understand the language.” Derry Girls, she says, was massive for changing that – even if some fans still need to watch it with subtitles on.It wasGame of Thronesthat took Belfast to new TV heights. From 2010, the Emmy-winning fantasy was largely filmed at the newly renovated shipyard Titanic Studios and nearby Linen Mill Studios in Banbridge, with proximity to the coast and countryside making it cheap and easy to film Westeros’s varied landscapes on location. As I stop at the city’s pubs on a food tour, my guide, Barry, says the Harp and the Duke of York were once packed with stars like Kit Harington and Emilia Clarke. But, he says, they were treated no differently to the next person enjoying a Guinness or a Harp: “Belfast people don’t let people get above their station, no matter who they are.”View image in fullscreenLisa McGee at the premiere of How to Get to Heaven from Belfast.Photograph: StillMoving.Net/ShutterstockNight falls and the city’s independent cinema, Queen’s Film theatre, opens its doors for the screening of How to Get to Heaven from Belfast. McGee arrives dressed in a tartan power suit and, with James Nesbitt in the audience, introduces the first episode. It is decidedly different to Derry Girls: a “mystery and comedy with horror elements” about three women in their late 30s – Dara, Saoirse, Robyn – who go on a road trip to find their dead friend. True to its title, the show is filmed and set in and around Belfast, with the area’s history naturally baked in.McGee, now a Belfast resident via Derry and London, has loved showing her city to Netflix’s international audience, and local residents will recognise sights such as the yellow Harland and Wolff cranes, Lyric theatre, Grand Central hotel and Limelight nightclub. “I went to uni at Queen’s so I’ve done a few 70s nights at the Limelight,” she says with a smile. “But everywhere has their own [version of] Limelight, you know what I mean? Those specifics are what makes the story universal.”For Belfast-born Roisin Gallagher, who stars as Saoirse, it was the dialogue and fast-talking that made How to Get to Heaven from Belfast feel true to life: “I knew it. I understood it. To read something that you identify with because it’s in your DNA, it’s in your bones. There’s such an integrity in being allowed to speak as fast as Saoirse would speak. Not to streamline it for a wider audience, but just be really true to the nature of the place that you’re from.”View image in fullscreenCaoilfhionn Dunne (Dara), Roisin Gallagher (Saoirse) and Sinéad Keenan (Robyn) in How to Get to Heaven from Belfast.Photograph: NetflixA 40-minute drive out of Belfast the next morning, I check into the Harbourview hotel in Carnlough, on the wet and wild Antrim coast. This whiskey hotel, renamed the Knockdara in the script, is the starting point of the show’s road trip, where the friends stay before the funeral (weirdly, there is a wake happening when I arrive). The hotel has since had a revamp, but I immediately recognise the reception desk that Ardal O’Hanlon’s hotel manager pops up at, with a flashing dicky-bow. The hotel’s co-owner, Adrian McLaughlin, is embracing the Netflix effect: “We’re going to have a screening party and watch it on the big screen!” There’s already a themed cocktail menu with one called the Wake, laced with Irish whiskey.It isn’t the first time a TV show has brought visitors to this quaint harbour. Two minutes from the hotel are the steps emerging from the sea which Arya climbed up after being stabbed by the Waif in Game of Thrones. A jeweller who provided items for the show is based just down the road, a couple tells us over dinner later, the woman flashing her ring. Screen tourism has boosted Northern Ireland’s economy significantly: Blue Lights and Hope Street created more than 280 jobs, with theBBC investing£112m in the country in 2023/34; Game of Thronesinjected£251m into the area. Endless studio and bus tours followed, and fans love embarking on their own location adventures.View image in fullscreenA Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.Photograph: HBOGlenarm Castle estate, a short drive away from the Harbourview, should probably ready itself for some screen tourism, too. As George the butler hosts a tour of the residence, I ask whether A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms – which has a second series planned for 2027 – was filmed here. He points out of the window at the open grounds and says a set was erected there for a few months, constantly covered with a mysterious mist: “It looked like a medieval village.” Staff didn’t have a clue what was taking place but they tried to guess the storyline with the sigils they spotted.There’s plenty more top telly cooking in Belfast, from the third season of Jimmy McGovern’s Bafta-winningTimeto psychological thrillerClose to Meand that long-awaited Line of Duty comeback. Bill Murray has also been spotted filming a golf drama, and Blue Lights, now in its fourth season, is surely here to stay – although Grimes is tight-lipped about the return of popular (and last seen dead in season one) copper Gerry.“I do think we are special,” she says of her industry. “We are supportive of each other – we now have the opportunity to shine on screen. People like working here. It’s friendly and the locals are sincere about wanting everyone who visits to have a good experience and a laugh.“We were bereft of visitors for many years, so now we like to show the world all the good bits.”How to Get to Heaven from Belfast is on Netflix nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionDerry GirlsBelfastLine of DutyBlue LightsGame of ThronesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Other additions to Emily Brontë’s 1847 novel include BDSM, masturbation on the moors, beds filled with eggs for erotic effect, and endless sex in the rain.Meanwhile, characters have been omitted or conflated, key plot details altered and the entire second half of the book left out. As well as ensuring a bumpy ride for English literature students tempted to watch the movie rather than read the novel, such changes have caused consternation among a number of academics and fans of Brontë’s work.Yet staff at theBrontë Parsonage Museumin Haworth, West Yorkshire, have offered a stout defence of the film, calling it “amazing”, “exciting” and “fantastic”.“I loved it,” said Zoe, who works in housekeeping at the museum. “It made me quite emotional. I thought it was amazing.”“It really does feel like a fever dream,” said Mia, her colleague from digital engagement. “From the stunning costumes and sets to the dramatic soundtrack, it’s a great escape to the world ofWuthering Heights. The themes of the novel do shine through.”Ruth, a visitor experience coordinator, agreed that Fennell’s film – which was inspired by her experience reading the novel as a 14-year-old – captures “some essential truths to the book and the relationship between Heathcliff and Cathy”.View image in fullscreenThe Brontë  Parsonage Museum in Haworth.Photograph: David Pearson/Alamy“I really enjoyed it,” she said, adding it made a refreshing alternative to previous adaptations, which include the 1939 version with Merle Oberon and Laurence Olivier, 1992’s take with Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes, and Andrea Arnold’s 2011 film.Many members of staff expressed the hope it would lead people back to the novel. “I think it will make a lot of viewers intrigued to read the book,” said Sam, from the museum’s programming department.Others did concede there had been “a lot of changes to the original novel”. “Some may not like [that]”, said Sue, from the learning wing, “but it’s an exciting film to watch in its own right.”“Is it faithful? No,” said outreach officer Diane. “Is it for purists? No. Is it an entertaining riff on the novel? Yes!” She also endorsed the casting ofJacob Elordias Heathcliff, despite Brontë’s novel describing him as “dark-skinned”. The actor was “fantastic”, she said, “and nailed the accent”.The staff watched the film at a preview screening on Thursday in Keighley organised by studio Warner Bros. “We weren’t involved in the making of the film at all,” said Rebecca Yorke, director of the museum and the Brontë Society.“ButEmerald Fennellwas a guest at our Brontë women’s writing festival in September where she spoke eloquently about Wuthering Heights and her personal response to it. Any new interpretation is likely to appeal to one audience more than another and spark lively debate.”View image in fullscreen‘Nailed the accent’ … Jacob Elordi as Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights.Photograph: 2026 Warner Bros. Ent/PAAmong those in the audience at the first public screening in Leeds on Friday morning was Brontë’s most recent biographer, Dr Claire O’Callaghan. “I enjoyed it,” she said. “Brilliant performances. There’s a lot of fun built into it, as well as the intensity and tragedy.”Fennell made it clear the film was her own spin on the story, which was “really refreshing”, said O’Callaghan. “There’s no attempt to have fidelity to the original. If it was more of a period drama then people might get more upset. But this is so far removed from that, and so over the top.”The Brontë Parsonage Museum is situated in the home in which Charlotte, Emily and Anne wrote their groundbreaking novels, which was bought by industrialist Sir James Roberts in 1928 and donated to the Brontë Society. Emily died in the house aged 30 in 1848, the year after she published her first and only book, under the pen name Ellis Bell.Wuthering Heights review – too hot, too greedy adaptation guarantees bad dreams in the nightRead moreEarly reviews for the novel contained similar declarations of disgust as the less approving notices for Fennell’s film. “The reader is shocked, disgusted, almost sickened by details of cruelty, inhumanity, and the most diabolical hate and vengeance,” said Douglas Jerrold’s Weekly Newspaper.“We are expecting increased visitor numbers and have already a large increase in sales of Wuthering Heights,” said Yorke. “We have extended our opening hours and produced exclusive merchandise in response.”The film is tracking to take more than $80m (£58.7m) – around its production budget – over its opening weekend of release. As part of the marketing drive, Warner Bros haspartnered with scores of brands on official Wuthering Heightsproducts, from thongs to passport covers.Explore more on these topicsWuthering HeightsEmily BrontëMargot RobbieJacob ElordiEmerald FennellnewsShareReuse this content"

And here he is, doing just that: played by the baritone Daisuke Ohyama, with the forces of Scottish Opera ranged around him.Over five acts,The Great Wavegives us episodes from Hokusai’s life and death, beginning with his funeral then continuing in flashback, including a dream sequence in which he encounters the wave that inspired his most famous print. As you might expect, it looks beautiful. The production is the work of an all-Japanese team headed by the director Satoshi Miyagi, and it’s full of Hokusai’s pictures, projected upon the bamboo walls of Junpei Kiz’s set, which reflect the artist’s barrel-shaped coffin. It often sounds beautiful, too: Fujikura uses the shakuhachi – a recorder-like flute, played by Shozan Hasegawa – as the basis for a light-infused soundworld conjuring openness and simplicity in almost Copland-esque style, made piquant with fluttering, elusive orchestral textures.View image in fullscreenEdward Hawkins,Daisuke Ohyama and Julieth Lozano Rolong in Scottish Opera’s The Great Wave.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/the GuardianEveryone begins wearing white – blank canvases – but Hokusai and Ōi, his daughter and helpmeet, gradually become soaked in the expensive Prussian blue pigment that, this being closed-off 19th-century Japan, must be obtained through forbidden trade with the dreaded Dutch. There’s no real jeopardy, though: we learn in passing that Hokusai’s house has burned down, and that he risks execution for trading with the Dutch, but none of these things trouble him. Even when a bunch of elegantly dancing heavies are poised to lop off the toes of his grandson, who has run up gambling debts, he goes on painting.So it’s less the retelling of a life story, more a series of extended vignettes, or a Philip Glass-style meditation. But on what? There’s a reason why there are so few successful stage works about successful artists. Hokusai is a happy man whose only wish is for a long life so that he can continue to develop his art. At more than one point – for example, when Hokusai is dashing off glorious animal pictures for a queue of fans – it feels like a discussion of the mechanics of giving the public what they want. As for Ōi, she’s an artist herself, a divorcee who has returned to her father’s house as his assistant – but if her feelings about this are even remotely mixed, we barely hear of it.View image in fullscreenBeautiful … Ohyama in The Great Wave.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/the GuardianVocally, Ōi is the star, andJulieth Lozano Rolongradiates her generous nature, singing in a glowing high soprano. There are strong performances, too, from the supporting cast, including Shengzhi Ren, doubling as Hokusai’s canny agent and a sweetshop owner wistfully remembering his favourite customer, and the sweet-sounding tenor Luvo Maranti as the pesky grandson. Conducted by Stuart Stratford, the orchestra and chorus play and sing with absolute conviction.Cash-strappedScottish Operahas been able to develop a project with funding attached and has run with it admirably. With an exhibition in the foyer and a programme book full of interesting essays, there’s a lot to be learned about Hokusai here.

The esteemed film-maker was licking his wounds: his most recent picture,Far from the Madding Crowd, which imbued its 19th-century rural characters with an anachronistic King’s Road style and panache, had flopped stateside.Childers approached the date with mixed feelings. He adored Schlesinger’s previous movie, the jazzyDarling, starring Julie Christie as a model on the make, and had seen it three times.But he had heard the director described as “mercurial”. His solution was to take a friend along with him to the bar at the Beverly Wilshire hotel for backup. “I thought: This guy might be a total shit,” recalls Childers, now 81, on the phone from Palm Springs. “I told my friend, ‘Two kicks under the table means we’re out of here. One kick meansyou’reout of here.’”It didn’t take long for that solitary kick to come. “John was charming and witty, with these twinkling eyes. I knew I could handle this.” Once Childers’ friend departed, the two men weren’t alone for long. “The actor Lee Remick came by to speak to John. She had Frank Sinatra with her. ‘Pleased to meet you, Mr Sinatra ….’ I thought: This could be a really great life.” And it was: the pair were together until the director’s death in 2003 at the age of 77. To mark the centenary this month of Schlesinger’s birth, Childers is hosting a programme of the director’s work in Palm Springs, called My Husband Makes Movies. At the same time, the UK is getting its own touring season, The Consummate Professional:John Schlesingerat 100,, which aims to revive interest in the man behind the movies.View image in fullscreenX-rated … Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight in Midnight Cowboy.Photograph: MGMMost renowned among them, though not quite the best, isMidnight Cowboy. It was this adaptation of James Leo Herlihy’s novel that Schlesinger was preparing to direct when he and Childers met. From that first month together in 1967, any division between their personal and professional lives was negligible; if Schlesinger was making a film, Childers was part of its fabric. The director took his new lover with him to New York while he worked on Midnight Cowboy. “I said, ‘Is this some John Wayne western?’ He said, ‘Hardly, my dear. Read it.’” When Childers reached the final page of Waldo Salt’s script about a naive Texas hustler trying to make it in a seamy, salacious New York, he was agog. “It was the wildest thing I’d ever read. So ribald and X-rated.”View image in fullscreenSchlesinger’s partner, Michael Childers, in Palm Springs, 2008.Photograph: ZUMA Press, Inc./AlamyChilders helped to make it wilder still. For the sequence in the script which simply read “A party in Greenwich Village ensues”, he suggested staging the whole thing “like an Andy Warhol loft party”. Childers roped in the Warhol set – Viva, Joe Dallesandro, Paul Morrissey and others – to a shoot a scene that ended up taking three days, becoming ever more debauched. “Andy wanted to be in it, too,” he says casually, “but he’d just been shot.”Schlesinger’s early hat-trick – his 1962 kitchen-sink debut,A Kind of Loving, followed byBilly Liarand Darling – helped to facilitate and crystallise advances in British cinema in the first half of the 1960s. As the decade ended, Midnight Cowboy became one of the agents of Hollywood’s burgeoning radicalism and disinhibition. Dustin Hoffman, who played Joe Buck’s scuzzy sidekick Ratso Rizzo, was at a preview screening where “people walked out in droves” at the sight of a male student (played by an adorably goofy Bob Balaban) going down on Joe in a Times Square grindhouse. “We thought this could end everybody’s career,” Hoffman said.Instead, Midnight Cowboy won Schlesinger an Oscar for best director and became the first X-rated movie to bag the best picture prize. Its success paved the way forSunday Bloody Sunday, Schlesinger’s 1971 masterpiece about a love triangle among middle-class Londoners, with a bisexual artist (Murray Head) dividing his affections between a gay doctor (Peter Finch) and a divorcee (Glenda Jackson). Midnight Cowboy is a conflicted study of repressed homosexuality festering into violence – it could be a homophobic film, a film about homophobia, or both – whereas its follow-up was both more blase and more sophisticated. A kiss between Finch and Head is shown near the start of the film in stark, brightly lit closeup: no mollifying music, no cuts, no shame. “That kiss was going to be in closeup or not at all,” said Schlesinger. “I wanted it as big and as natural as any kiss that’s been on the screen.”View image in fullscreenSchlesinger directing Sunday Bloody Sunday.Photograph: MGMHe went on to enjoy commercial hits almost as big as Midnight Cowboy, such as the 1976 thriller Marathon Man, with its infamous scene of Hoffman being tortured in the dentist’s chair by Nazi fugitive Laurence Olivier. Schlesinger would even make a pair of films, written by Alan Bennett and concerning British traitors, which rivalled the eloquence of Sunday Bloody Sunday:An Englishman Abroad, with Alan Bates as Guy Burgess, andA Question of Attribution, starring James Fox as Anthony Blunt. Yet while his early movies are widely known and highly regarded (Midnight Cowboy was recently turned into a stage musical), the man himself is another matter. “The films are familiar but the name doesn’t ring a bell for people,” says Claire Nicolas, one of the producers of the UK season.John Schlesinger 1926-2003: a tribute to a man who defined British cinemaRead moreThe reasons are varied. Eclecticism may be partly to blame. A director whose résumé includes a scabrous study of Hollywood decadence and immorality (The Day of the Locust), a gentle wartime love story (Yanks) and a vulgar big-budget comedy featuring car crashes and a waterskiing elephant (Honky Tonk Freeway) will always be a challenge to pigeonhole or commodify. “I think he contained a few too many multitudes,” says Nicolas’s co-curator, Marc David Jacobs. “Luca Guadagnino is a great modern parallel. He’s another director who makes very different films, some of which click and some don’t. And without Sunday Bloody Sunday, you wouldn’t have a film like Challengers.”It’s easy enough to identify the hallmarks of individual movies but trickier to say what constitutes a typical Schlesinger film. They don’t have the identifiable visual or rhythmic imprint of Nicolas Roeg, who shot Far from the Madding Crowd before becoming a director himself. Schlesinger did possess a certain ad-agency predilection for clanging symbolism: the contrast between the hardships of the developing world and the casual profligacy of the western one is highlighted none too subtly in throwaway images in Darling and Sunday Bloody Sunday, while the notion of characters as helpless goldfish swimming in a bowl turns up first in Darling and again in the 1984 espionage thriller The Falcon and the Snowman, starring Sean Penn.View image in fullscreenJulie Christie in 1967’s Far from the Madding Crowd.Photograph: MGM/Studiocanal/AllstarEfforts to capture the director’s essence, though, tend toward the diffuse. “He has always been so in tune with life,” said Glenda Jackson. Julia Prewitt Brown, author ofThe Films of John Schlesinger, believes his films concern “the importance of survival, of just getting through the day and of trying to make the best of what one has”. Then again, you could say the same about The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.Some of the claims made in the UK season’s press release are debatable: though Schlesinger engages fully with his own Jewishness via Finch’s character in Sunday Bloody Sunday, it is difficult to agree that he holds the title of Britain’s greatest Jewish film-maker in a world where Mike Leigh exists. More understandable is the way Schlesinger’s pioneering LGBTQ+ representation has become a unifying thread in appreciation of his work, beginning with Malcolm (Roland Curram), the easy-breezy photographer in Darling, who cruises a waiter and is later whisked away on the back of his scooter.Even when the characters are scarcely more than extras, such as the muscle marys who pop up intermittently throughout Honky Tonk Freeway, they are at least conspicuous. Childers adopts an unforgiving approach to anyone who isn’t au fait with his late husband’s place in the queer landscape. “Sunday Bloody Sunday is one of the five most important gay pieces in the world,” he says. “I get furious when young gay people haven’t seen it. It’s part of their culture!”The director was relaxed and open about his sexuality. Bennett recounts in his diaries the story of Schlesinger receiving his CBE from Queen Elizabeth II, who had a brief struggle fitting the ribbon around his neck. “Now, Mr Schlesinger, we must try to get thisstraight,” she said – a remark that he chose to see, said Bennett, “as both a coded acknowledgment and a seal of royal approval”.View image in fullscreenSchlesinger on the set of The Falcon and the Snowman, 1985.Photograph: RONALD GRANTThis sits uneasily with the nine-minute film he made in 1991, known informally asJohn Major: The Movie, to promote the Conservative party, thereby doing his bit to help it to a surprise win at the next year’s general election (at which Schlesinger himself admitted to voting Tory). This assignment came a mere three years after the implementation of section 28, which outlawed the so-called “promotion” of homosexuality in schools and followed Margaret Thatcher’s complaint that children were being taught they had “an inalienable right to be gay”.Jacobs puts this down partly to contrarianism. “Growing up in a very leftwing atmosphere of film-making in Britain, he had some dissatisfaction with that. Also, 1992 was not a great year for Schlesinger’s career. And this was a paycheck, after all.” Indeed: while the Chariots of Fire director Hugh Hudson gave his equivalent services to Labour for nothing, Schlesinger was handsomely remunerated. This may be the reason not only for his hypocrisy in shilling for the Tories, but also for his late-career drift into hack-work. Few directors who enjoy such sustained early acclaim have gone on to make a comparable abundance of bad films.Luca Guadagnino is a great modern parallel: without Sunday Bloody Sunday, you wouldn’t have ChallengersSchlesinger was famous for his temper. “No one had a shorter fuse,” said Bennett, while an unnamed crew member likened him to “Zeus, flinging down the lightning bolts”. So how did he deal with his numerous flops? “Manic depression,” says Childers. “That wasnotfun.”The director got his biggest bruising on Honky Tonk Freeway, a costly 1981 disaster that hobbled him for ever in Hollywood. Later low-points include the 1987 ritual horror The Believers and his 2000 swansong,The Next Best Thing, starring Madonna and Rupert Everett but dismally bereft of either rom or com. “I begged John not to do that film,” Childers sighs. “I thought it was a load of shit. And it is. When Madonna tries to act, oh, it’s terrible.”Sean Penn believed Schlesinger’s talents were waning as far back as The Falcon and the Snowman –a shoot so fraught that actor and director were reduced to communicating through an intermediary even when standing only a few feet apart. “I just don’t think that John was on his game at that moment: I think he was getting safe,” said Penn.View image in fullscreenWith Alan Bates, on location for A Kind of Loving, 1962.Photograph: RONALD GRANTAfter Schlesinger’s death, Bennett observed that he “wasn’t by nature a journeyman film-maker, taking whatever came along, but was forced into this way of working by having three houses to keep up, one of them in Hollywood, and always leading quite an expensive life.” It could almost be the end of Darling, with Christie as the go-getting model seduced by fame, money and sex but finally imprisoned and defeated by the luxurious life she has woven around herself.Nicolas argues, though, that it is precisely these conflicts and disappointments that make the Schlesinger story so compelling and revealing. “He made these incredible award-winning classics but also some questionable pieces of work,” she says. “Understanding any director is about comprehending the whole career, the whole context, and what the failures say about them as much as the successes. With this season, we’re asking cinemas: ‘Don’t just book the award-winners. Look at the other films, too.’ Otherwise, what’s the point?”The Consummate Professional: John Schlesinger at 100 is at various UK venues until JuneExplore more on these topicsFilmJohn SchlesingerLuca GuadagninoLGBTQ+ rightsJohn MajorfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ahead of his fifth album, Stephen Bruner explains his polymath mindsetAlexis PetridisFri 13 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 13 Feb 2026 06.58 ESTShareIt is an overcast Thursday afternoon at the end of January, andThundercatis telling me about the time he tried to interest Snoop Dogg in the mid-70s oeuvre of Frank Zappa. He wasn’t Thundercat then, he explains. He was still Stephen Bruner, bass player for hire, who had fetched up in what he calls a “stupid-as-hell, Rick James-level band” backing the venerable rapper, packed with Los Angeles jazz luminaries who would later contribute to Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly: Kamasi Washington, Josef Leimberg, Terrace Martin. Alas, their jazz chops were sometimes deemed surplus to requirements. At one point, while Bruner was playing an expansive bass solo on stage, Snoop sidled up to him and flatly announced: “Ain’t nobody told you to play allthat.”So perhaps it was in the spirit of horizon-broadening that Bruner took it upon himself to play Snoop the song St Alfonzo’s Pancake Breakfast, a knotty, marimba-heavy slice of jazz-rock from Zappa’s 1974 album Apostrophe, which switches time signatures three times in less than two minutes, and features lyrics about a man stealing margarine and urinating on a bingo card. “Yeah, I hit him with the rollercoaster,” Bruner chuckles. “He was smoking, and he almost ate his blunt, saying: ‘What thehellis going on?’ I said: ‘My sentiments exactly.’ I think I did a cartwheel after that and left the band:I played Snoop Dogg St Alfonzo’s Breakfast, my job is done here, I have no more work to do.” He thinks for a moment. “Or maybe I got fired: ‘Get out of here dude, you’re too weird.’ I forget. It was a great moment.”View image in fullscreenIn London, January 2026.Photograph: Ollie Tikare/The Guardian; Assistant: Eddie DaviesThis, it becomes apparent as we attempt to discuss his forthcoming fifth album, is a very Thundercat kind of anecdote, involving one of the impossibly eclectic cast of musicians he has worked with over his career: he is presumably the only person in history who can claim to have played with Ariana Grande andHerbie Hancock, and to have been in an early 00s boyband (No Curfew, briefly big in Germany) and the gnarly thrash metal institution Suicidal Tendencies. You get the impression he wasn’t terribly happy as a member of the former: “I’m a working-class musician, man, and that was what it meant for me at the age of 14”. He spent nine years in the latter, however, powering his way through songs called Widespread Bloodshed and We’re F’n Evil. (It’s worth noting that he was also working with Erykah Badu at the same time.)View image in fullscreenPlaying with the thrash-metal band Suicidal Tendencies at Hammerfest, Prestatyn, in 2010.Photograph: Metal Hammer/Future/Getty ImagesHe looks puzzled when I ask if he can think of any musical situation in which he would feel uncomfortable playing. “Whatever brain disposition that lets you know you’re in a dangerous situation, I don’t think I have,” he says, shrugging. “I think constantly performing has allowed that to not be such a problematic thing to me. What’s that saying? ‘Luck is just preparation met with opportunity’?”In addition, the Snoop story also involves a dramatic and improbable collision of genres, very much Thundercat’s stock in trade. He says his transition from multipurpose sideman to solo artist in the early 2010s felt strangely natural to him, maybe because the music he started making was as strange and eclectic as the list of artists on his CV. His solo albums to date have piloted a wildly zigzagging path between funk, jazz-fusion, electronic pop, yacht rock, hip-hop, psychedelia, punk and chiptune, among other things, all of it lavishly decorated with the kind of extravagant bass solos that so upset Snoop Dogg.It shouldn’t really work, but it does, perhaps because the bizarre stylistic cocktails never seem forced, but a natural extension of his impossibly catholic tastes. Over the course of our afternoon, he goes from enthusing wildly about Leon Ware’s mid-70s masterpiece of sophisticated soulMusical Massage, to explaining theLydian mode, to demonstrating a clearly encyclopaedic knowledge of the work of Chick Corea, to earnestly discussing the “really innovative” oeuvre of Limp Bizkit. He thinks his musical tastes are down to his parents, both musicians – his dad drummed with the Temptations – and ardent believers that categorising music was just a marketing tool, an idea that clearly seeped in on a very deep level. By the time he was a teenager, he was as enamoured of Slipknot andKornas he was of theBilly CobhamandGeorge Dukealbums his parents played, or the jazz artists he and Washington were sneaking in, underage, to see in LA clubs.Clearly Thundercat is a pop star unlike any other, although you don’t need to know his backstory to work that out: you just have to look at him. Today in London, despite having recently landed from LA, he is dressed in typically head-turning style: voluminous corduroy trousers, shirt featuring a kind of 19th-century military brocade, trainers decorated with metallic skeleton toes, and dip-dyed dreadlocks held back from his face by a pair of enormous silver grips featuring snarling tigers. Perhaps worried that this might look insufficiently arresting, he has accessorised with a huge metallic breastplate bearing the logo of the cartoon alien felines from whom he took his name. He is an obsessive fan of cartoons, comic books and science fiction and peppers his conversation with references to manga and video games, a couple of them so obscure that I have to look them up when I get home.Whatever brain disposition that lets you know you’re in a dangerous situation, I don’t think I haveHe tells me that his “greatest moment ever” was getting a cameo role as a man with a robotic hand in the Star Wars TV seriesThe Book of Boba Fett. “I can use that in an argument every time somebody gets too high and mighty: ‘Hey, you can’t talk to me like that, I was in Star Wars!’” he nods. “It wasn’t one of those never meet your heroes moments. You can’t ruin Star Wars for me. Certain characters and certain principles it was created off are timeless, they still stand. The struggle between dark and light, what is considered dark and what is considered light; the Force, which is like flatulence basically.” He notes my baffled expression and smiles. “It’s all about how you choose to use it, man. Maybe as a weapon.”View image in fullscreenStephen Bruner as the Modifier in The Book of Boba Fett.Photograph: Capital Pictures/AlamyBut he hasn’t stopped off in London to discuss Star Wars. Bruner has a new album, Distracted, which seems to be head-spinning business as usual: smooth soft-rock piano ballads abut house tracks, A$AP Rocky raps over a beat that owes as much to shoegaze as to hip-hop, while both Lil Yachty and defiantly retro indie duo the Lemon Twigs are also in the supporting cast.Not for the first time in his career, the eclecticism is so diverting that it’s initially easy to miss how fraught and downcast a lot of the songs are:2011’s The Golden Age of Apocalypsemourned the drug-related death of his friend and collaborator Austin Peralta; his 2017 breakthrough Drunk probed his problematic relationship with alcohol, while Distracted’s predecessor,It Is What It Iswas consumed with grief over the death of his “best friend”, rapperMac Miller.I’ve heard putting out an album being compared to postpartum depressionHe says It Is What It Is was particularly difficult to make – “There was a lot of trauma linked to it, a lot of pain” – compounded by the fact that it was released at the height of lockdown. “I’ve heard putting out an album being compared to postpartum depression – you have such an attachment to this thing because of how much you obsess about it, then you put it out and then there’s this kind of weird feeling of loneliness. And because of fucking Covid, It Is What It Is came out to complete silence, like: drop the album and go sit in darkness, see if you can amp the pain up some more.“There was a lot going on at the time that album came out, and just having to sit with it, I couldn’t … I would almost, like, vomit at the thought of it. But ultimately, when I look back, I’m very grateful for the chance to have sat down, because to have to go on stage and deal with it night after night, say goodbye to my friends over and over again, would have been another traumatising experience.”View image in fullscreenThundercat at FYF Fest 2017 in Los Angeles.Photograph: Rich Fury/Getty ImagesInstead of touring, Bruner took stock. He gave up drinking and took up boxing training with such dedication that “even my trainers wonder what the hell I’m doing sometimes: ‘Hey, are you training for a fight or something?’” He gives a mordant chuckle. “I’m like, ‘You mean world war three, because that seems to be on?’”He says the new album is “a bit of a diary, my thought processing”, and it seems to relate to the soul-searching he did in the aftermath of the release of It Is What Is. There are songs about his capacity for self-sabotage, about failed relationships, about his suspicion that some of his more erratic behaviour might be the result of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, although he isn’t diagnosed. “I think that it’s a byproduct of the environment, as most sicknesses are,” he says. “We got cell phones, we got microtransactions, you use your brain in 30-second bursts, and you’re going to adjust to that even if you don’t want to. And even if it was something you could get diagnosed, it’s like, I’m 40 years old, and I didn’t die so far. And I know not one creative person whose brain isn’t of that nature. It comes with the territory. So I guess it’s somewhere along the lines of a superpower.”The album also returns to the late Miller, who appears on She Knows Too Much, a track the pair recorded in Malibu some years before Miller’s death. No, Bruner says, it wasn’t weird returning to the recording and hearing his late friend’s voice booming around the studio again. The tracks that address Miller’s death on It Is What It Is were consumed by an almost paralysing misery: “So hard to get over it, I tried to get under it, I’m stuck in between,” he sang on the title track.View image in fullscreen‘Stand still too long, somebody’s going to hit you with something’ …Thundercat.Photograph: Ollie Tikare/The Guardian; Assistant: Eddie DaviesBut She Knows Too Much – a buoyant funk-fuelled track that finds Miller in his first flush of mega-fame, reflecting on his new celebrity in witty, earthy terms – offered a reminder of when they made it. “It was the funniest shit ever,” says Bruner. “It was hilarious, I remember it viscerally. I like to describe Mac almost like he was a one-man Rat Pack. When I would see him, I would somehow feel like we were supposed to be wearing suits. Like weird, highbrow bullshit and shenanigans. And tomfoolery! That’s what we were up to. It’s just a clear picture of who we were.”‘It’s dark in the US right now. But I turn on a light, you know?’: Mavis Staples on Prince, Martin Luther King and her 75-year singing careerRead moreBruner says Distracted is “the sound of me choosing happy”. If it occasionally sounds troubled or downcast, well, “choosing happy is a hell of a process”.And, indeed, he does seem happy, joking about his new album having to compete with Cardi B – “I got to get myself a fatter ass, I got to get a BBL” – enthusing about a forthcoming visit to Paris fashion week.It’s weird, he says: for all the changes that his career has gone through, it doesn’t feel that different from his early days when he was playing weddings or, later, in Suicidal Tendencies. “My main memory is thinking if I stood still for too long, I’d get hit with a beer can. I think the same principle applies. Actually, I think that principle applies to every stage of life: stand still too long, somebody’s going to hit you with something.”With that, he shakes my hand and heads off into the London dusk, breastplate clanking a little as he goes, heads understandably turning as he passes.Distracted is released 3 April on Brainfeeder. The single I Did This to Myself (ft Lil Yachty) is out now. Thundercat’s UK tour begins 25 March at Brixton Academy"

Reposting the clip on social media,Reese wrote: “I hate to say it. It’s likely over for us.”He added: “In next to no time, one person is going to be able to sit at a computer and create a movie indistinguishable from what Hollywood now releases. True, if that person is no good, it will suck. But if that person possesses Christopher Nolan’s talent and taste (and someone like that will rapidly come along), it will be tremendous.”Robinson said that the clip resulted from a “2 line prompt in Seedance 2”, referring to theAI video generator Seedance 2.0, released on Thursday by TikTok co-owners ByteDance.The Motion Picture Association (MPA), the Hollywood trade association, accused ByteDance of “unauthorised use of US copyrighted works on a massive scale”.AI systems such as chatbots, image generators and video-making tools are trained on data taken from the open web, including copyright-protected material such as novels, art and film clips. This has led to artists and creative industries demanding compensation for theuse of their materialand the establishment of licensing frameworks to enable legal use of their content. Amid lawsuits related to those disputes, some creative companies such asDisney are signing deals with AI firmsincluding OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.Calling on ByteDance to “cease its infringing activity”,MPA chair and CEO Charles Rivkin said: “By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs.”Beeban Kidron, a crossbench peer in the UK and aprominent campaigner against relaxing copyright law, said AI companies must strike deals with the creative industries.Kidron, who has alsoworked in Hollywoodas a film director, said: “This is just the latest in a long stream of copyright abuses, but honestly from my conversations with both sides I believe there is a will between AI companies and the creative sector to make a deal. It seems to me that the AI sector needs to come to the table with a “real offer” that satisfies the creative industries. Otherwise we will have a decade of litigation and the destruction of an industry on which they depend.”ByteDance has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsFilmAI (artificial intelligence)Film industryComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Everything and everyone becomes a ruin eventually. Entropy, the tendency of order to decay into chaos, is a fact of physics as well as everyday experience. But in the past, as now, the shiny and new was often valued above the timeworn: old churches were destroyed in the Renaissance, for instance, to make way for bigger, “better” ones. This painting shows how in the 18th century that attitude was turned upside down. For the first time, broken old buildings were cherished as atmospheric, picturesque wonders. Guardi is so in love with ruins that he invents one, imagining a crumbled, partly collapsed medieval abbey or palace against a blue Italian sky. When was it built, who lived here? He invites you to imagine this architecture’s glorious past while savouring the melancholy beauty of its present.National Gallery, LondonSign up to the Art Weekly newsletterIf you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email,please sign up here.Get intouchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailnewsletters@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsArt and designArt Weekly newsletterPaintingPhotographyArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As he prepares to release new EP, Big Mama, on 6 March, he’ll be answering your questions.Born into a musical family including Alice Coltrane as his great aunt, Ellison released debut album 1983 in 2006 but established his reputation with 2008’s Los Angeles: a crumpled, squelching mass of hip-hop beats and squirrelly melodies that was hailed as an instant electronic classic. More and more vocalists hopped on board for future projects – Kendrick Lamar, Thom Yorke and George Clinton among them – as his music scaled to ever greater psychedelic heights, including 3D-enhanced live shows.He split off into rap alter ego Captain Murphy; founded the label Brainfeeder, putting out music by artists including Thundercat and the late Ras G; and in 2017 moved into film with Kuso, a fantastical body horror positively oozing with bizarre characters and unspeakable fluids. He contributed a chapter of the horror anthology film V/H/S/99, teeing him up for an entry into the film-making mainstream with 2025’s Ash, a freaky sci-fi nightmare starring Eiza González and Aaron Paul.He hasn’t released an album since 2019’s Flamagra, but soundtracks and EPs have come along regularly, joined now by Big Mama. Ellison will answer your questions about this tentacular and ever-morphing career: post them in the comments below before 5pm GMT on Tuesday 17 February, and we’ll publish his answers in the 20 February edition of our Film & Music section, as well as online.Explore more on these topicsFlying LotusFilm & Music reader interviewElectronic musiccalloutShareReuse this content"

Asked if films can affect political change, Wenders said that “movies can change the world”but “not in a political way”.He added that film-makers “have to stay out of politics because if we make movies that are dedicatedly political, we enter the field of politics. But we are the counterweight of politics, we are the opposite of politics. We have to do the work of people, not the work of politicians.”In a statement on Friday announcing her withdrawal, Roy, who had been planning to attend a screening of her recently restored 1989 film In Which Annie Gives it Those Ones, called the comments “unconscionable” and feared they had reached “millions of people across the world”.View image in fullscreenWim Wenders takes part in the opening ceremony of the 76th Berlin film festival on Thursday.Photograph: Fabian Sommer/EPAThe Booker prize-winning Indian author said: “To hear them say that art should not be political is jaw-dropping. It is a way of shutting down a conversation about a crime against humanity even as it unfolds before us in real time – when artists, writers and film-makers should be doing everything in their power to stop it.”She added: “Although I have been profoundly disturbed by the positions taken by the German government and various German cultural institutions onPalestine, I have always received political solidarity when I have spoken to German audiences about my views on the genocide in Gaza.”Wenders is the serving president of this year’s Berlinale jury, which includes the American director-producer Reinaldo Marcus Green, the Japanese film-maker Hikari, the Nepalese director Min Bahadur Bham, the South Korean actor Bae Doona, the Indian director-producer Shivendra Singh Dungarpur, and Ewa Puszczyńska – who producedOscar-winning film The Zone of Interest, about the idyllic home life of an Auschwitz commandant and his family.The jury was questioned about the support the German government, which funds much of the festival, has shown for Israel. Puszczyńska called the question “complicted” and “a bit unfair”.“Of course, we are trying to talk to people – every single viewer – to make them think, but we cannot be responsible for what their decision would be to support Israel or the decision to support Palestine,” she said. “There are many other wars where genocide is committed and we do not talk about that.”Marwan Barghouti, ‘Palestine’s Mandela’, to publish book from prisonRead moreRoy, who was this week longlisted for the Women’s prize for non-fiction for her first memoir, Mother Mary Comes to Me, emphasised her belief that “what has happened inGaza, what continues to happen, is a genocide of the Palestinian people by the state of Israel”.She added: “It is supported and funded by the governments of the United States and Germany, as well as several other countries inEurope, which makes them complicit in the crime. If the greatest film-makers and artists of our time cannot stand up and say so, they should know that history will judge them. I am shocked and disgusted.”Reflecting on her film being slated for inclusion in the festival’s Classics section, the author said there had been “something sweet and wonderful” about In Which Annie Gives It Those One, describing it as “a whimsical film that I wrote 38 years ago”.Explore more on these topicsBerlin film festivalArundhati RoyWim WendersGazaPalestineEuropeIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

Show creator Kevin Williamson had based the character on himself; he went on to write the horror-comedy Scream and other films in the franchise.Spielberg was a surprise contributor to September’s Dawson’s Creek cast reunion event to raise funds for Fuck Cancer and for Van Der Beek’s medical treatment. The film-maker sent a video message saying: “Dawson, you made it. Maybe someday, I will get to have a Dawson’s closet.”The actor was too ill to attend the event in person but also sent a video message. In December, Van Der Beek auctioned off assorted memorabilia to help pay his medical bills, including some of the bedroom props indicating his character’s love of Spielberg’s films.The lots included a stuffed ET toy, which sold for $5,991 (£4,400), as well as an Indiana Jones figurine box and movie posters, which sold for between $2,000-$4,000 (£1,470-£2,940).View image in fullscreenJames Van Der Beek, third from right, in Dawson’s Creek.Photograph: Universal Images Group North America LLC/AlamyDonations tothe GoFundMe appealhave now surpassed $2m. A statement on behalf of Van Der Beek’s family on Thursday said: “Your kindness has meant more than we can put into words. In the middle of deep grief, your support has been a light. It reminds us that love is real, that community is strong, and that James’s spirit continues to bring people together.”Other industry names to have donated includeZoe Saldaña, who has pledged a monthly stipend of $2,500 (£1,840), and Wicked director Jon M Chu, who donated $10,000 (£7,350), as have Cameo co-founder Martin Blencowe and talent agent Guy Oseary.Spielberg topped Forbes’ 2025 survey of celebrity billionaires, with an estimated net worth of $5.3bn (£3.9bn). In January, Saldaña overtook Scarlett Johansson to become the highest-grossing actor of all time, having starred in films that have made more than $15.47bn (£11.37bn) worldwide.James Van Der Beek was so much more than just Dawson | Stuart HeritageRead moreMeanwhile, OpenAI CEO Fidji Simo has given $5,000 (£3,680), as has director Ellie Kanner.

Twenty per cent said that such films “remind me of the magic of when we met”, while half that number said such an activity was “low effort but still feels like bonding”.Among the less admitted reasons were “means I can fall asleep” (8%) and “means I can check my phone” (4%).The sexuality of those polled was not indicated, but Great Romance’s programming focuses on heterosexual stories.The findings were that female viewers diverge significantly in some key responses, with only 15% citing an unwillingness to argue as a motivating factor for watching something mushy, while just 11% believe doing so might precipitate sex.A third more women than men (15%) said that while low effort, it still feels like bonding, and significantly more women than men cited the potential for sleeping during the movie as a lure (11% versus 8%).The findings chime with a similar study undertaken in 2007 by Kansas university psychology professor Richard Harris, who asked 250 men and women to watch a romantic movie together then rate their enjoyment level on a seven-point scale, with seven being the top score. While the average female rating was around six, men on average rated the film – the title of which was not revealed – a 4.8. “Everyone thinks that women like romantic movies and that they drag guys along to them,” Harris told Reuters.“What was significant was that the guys also liked the movies, and that the choice to view a romantic movie was usually made together as a couple, not just by the girl.”As with Great Romance’s investigation, no sexuality was specified, but the assumption is that the men and women invited to watch the movie were already couples, and that the film was not a classic of queer cinema.Harris’s study also asked participants to guess the scene their date would most like to enact, as well as that they themselves would like to have been in. Women tended to choose romantic scenes, and guess their male partners would choose sex scenes, but Harris’s findings revealed far fewer of them played into this stereotype than anticipated.“There are a lot of men who go to these romantic movies and enjoy them,” he said. “I wouldn’t write off the male audience just because it is a romantic film. I would suggest marketing to the men in the audience.”Romance films released since Harris’s survey that have explicitly attempted to cater for both genders include Palm Springs, She’s Out of My League, Forgetting Sarah Marshall and much of Judd Apatow’s oeuvre including Knocked Up and The 40-Year-Old Virgin.The star of the last film, Steve Carell, recently said he thought box office returns for his 2011 film Crazy, Stupid, Love would have been higher had producers stuck with the original title, The Wingman. Carell believed that the buddy movie elements of the film involving his and Ryan Gosling’s characters might have attracted male viewers, both in couples and on their own, but they would have found asking for tickets to a film called Crazy, Stupid, Love embarrassing at the box office.Explore more on these topicsRomance filmsnewsShareReuse this content"

Many former contestants contribute (the story of Shandi Sullivan is particularly grotesque) as does creator Tyra Banks, who seems alternately sheepish and weirdly accusatory. “You guys were demanding it,” she claims. “So we kept pushing.”Netflix, from Monday 16 FebruaryBeing Gordon RamsayView image in fullscreenFamily affair … Tilly and Gordon Ramsay in Being Gordon Ramsay.Photograph: NetflixThis six-parter followsGordon Ramsayas he attempts to open several floors of foodie heaven at the top of 22 Bishopsgate in London. “This thing is going to take balls of steel,” Ramsay remarks. In his professional life, he’s the polar opposite of self-effacing – but a slightly less abrasive Ramsay emerges via glimpses of his family life and biographical excerpts in which he recalls his council estate upbringing. He also describes an intense, sink-or-swim kitchen apprenticeship under Marco Pierre White. It’s a feast of swearing and theatrical jeopardy, none of which will change anyone’s opinions about the chef.Netflix, from Wednesday18 FebruaryGirl on the Run: The Hunt for America’s Most Wanted WomanView image in fullscreenGripping … Girl on the Run: The Hunt for America’s Most Wanted Woman.This true crime documentary tells the startling story of Sarah Jo Pender who was sent to prison in 2002 after being convicted of murder. The case was deeply murky in the first place, involving a violent boyfriend, drug deals and an illegally purchased firearm. But in 2008, Pender escaped from a maximum security prison after conspiring with a guard and another prisoner. This film focuses mainly on the attempts to apprehend her – she was at large for four months.

It stars Gabriel Basso as Peter Sutherland, a special agent who works under deep cover, as a last resort for resolving security issues requiring a combination of extreme discretion and deadly force. In this third season, he’s (reluctantly) working with Genesis Rodriguez’s journalist Isabel who is investigating a dark money network.

But this series about an uptight attorney who moves to Las Vegas and soon finds he’s too boring to pass muster in Sin City contains just the right ratio of snarky and stupid. Lincoln Gumb is very much a shirt-and-tie guy. But soon, he’s taking cases involving stunt performers and general freaks – and joining forces with local magician Sheila Flambé who has been recruited to give Gumb Legal a touch of much-needed pizzazz.

However, when she returns (in a hilariously contrived twist, she’s managed to mislay her engagement ring) Lina discovers that the flat is riddled with hidden cameras. A series of betrayals then ensues as Lina tries to track down her voyeuristic tormentors.

Will it be a Nip/Tuck orGlee-level triumph? A return to inaugural American Horror Story form, as his recent outing The Beauty so nearly was? Or will it be something towards the other end of the scale, where the so-bad-it’s-bad,Kim-Kardashian-as-a-divorce-lawyerAll’s Fairlurks?Hmm. The latest one is Love Story:John F Kennedy Jr& Carolyn Bessette. It is a nine-episode series that lasts roughly as long as the golden couple’s relationship did in real life and is (unlike All’s Fair) punishingly boring. Some of this will be due to the fact that for a UK audience the Kennedys simply do not hold the fascination they have always held for Americans. Ever since the patriarch Joe successfully manoeuvred his telegenic son John F Kennedy into politics, the political dynasty have been the United States’ answer to the royal family. The minutiae of their privileged, cursed lives have been breathlessly chronicled in books by hagiographic biographers, tabloid articles seeking scandal, and everything in between. Over here, of course, we have naturally been less enthralled.So much less so that it is, perhaps, necessary to clarify at this point that, yes, John F Kennedy Jr is JFK’s son (little John-John, who came most heartbreakingly to public attention on his third birthday, as he saluted the coffin of his assassinated father as the funeral procession passed him). And Carolyn Bessette was, briefly, his wife. They started dating in 1994, married in 1996 and died in 1999, along with her sister Lauren, when the light aircraft John was piloting crashed into the Atlantic off Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts. Bessette is played by Sarah Pidgeon, managing to do a lot with – script-wise – very little. Kennedy is played by Paul Anthony Kelly, a model in his first major role, who may get the idea eventually.View image in fullscreen‘A media obsession from the moment they started’ … Kelly and Pidgeon in Love Story: John F Kennedy Jr & Carolyn Bessette.Photograph: Copyright 2025, FX. All rights reserved.You can see why the story (inspired by the book Once Upon a Time, created by Connor Hines, executive produced by Ryan M) was bound to be fed into the Murphy machine. There is class warfare, since John Jr was a god and Bessette was a feisty girl from the wrong side of the tracks (at least from the Kennedys’ point of view, but then who wasn’t?). There is celebrity culture – the pair were a media obsession from the moment they started dating (after their eyes met across a crowded Amazon fundraiser), especially as it was in the wake of John’s five-year, on-off relationship withDarryl Hannah. And there is glamour – the effortlessly elegant Bessette worked for Calvin Klein and became known as an impeccably stylish dresser and tastemaker, while John, of course, trailed clouds of glory everywhere he went as well as being a tremendously handsome and charismatic figure in whatever could be said to be his own right.All’s Fair review – Kim Kardashian’s divorce drama is fascinatingly, existentially terribleRead moreTheir relationship was complicated by the pressures of fame, endless paparazzi intrusion on their privacy and, allegedly, Bessette’s drug use and unwillingness to start a family. It should be enough to sustain a miniseries, but what emerges on screen is an endless, drab slog charting what feels like every moment, no matter how narratively pointless, of the couple’s pre-relationship situations, courtship and marriage. Up close and shorn of any of Murphy’s trademark razzle-dazzle, these are rendered as dull to watch as it is to hear about any couple you’ve never met and couldn’t care less about. There is an extended sequence of Bessette sending back different bouquets of red roses from John-John after newspaper reports that he is back with Hannah, which will send you cross-eyed with boredom, lines that make you want to throw yourself into a canal (“She’s unlike anyone I’ve ever met”, “I have worked too hard to watch you be sucked into this pervasive narrative of entitlement and recklessness that has plagued every member of this family”) and take the poor actors required to deliver them with you. Swim! Swim fast and swim far! And then swim further, because “Between your lineage and your heritage you’re like the poster child for emotional avoidance” is coming up behind you.Add to this two truly painful performances/vocal impressions – byNaomi WattsasJackie Onassis, and Dree Hemingway as Hannah (who, unless she actually is the sub-moronic wraith she is depicted as here, should sue) – and this is not a nine-hour story anyone could love, at least in this country. But we are a bagatelle to the Murphy market, so I’m sure there will be no slowdown in production or quality checks introduced at the factory. Brace yourselves.Love Story: John F Kennedy Jr & Carolyn Bessette is on Disney+ from 13 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewRyan MurphyJohn F Kennedy JrreviewsShareReuse this content"

Travellers have existed in every age, Nooteboom continues, but only for some does there exist a particular sorrow: that of the one who departs with no hope of return. For them, the voyage out becomes the life.Nooteboom, who was born in the Netherlands in 1933 anddied this week aged 92, was drawn to what could be grasped through the “prism of movement”. In a body of work that includes some 60 books of fiction, poetry, reportage and travel writing, of which only a dozen or so have been translated into English, he became a chronicler of departures. In The Following Story (translated by Ina Rilke),Nomad’s Hotel(translated by Ann Kelland),The Foxes Come at Night(translated by Ina Rilke) and Lost Paradise (translated by Susan Massotty) Nooteboom, his characters and his subjects take to the road. They glimpse histories dissolving from memory and past cruelties rekindled, again and again, in ways that chill the heart. Nooteboom was 12 years old when his father was killed during the second world war; he has said that his first childhood memories are of the bombings and the destruction in their wake.In the opening of his great novel, All Souls’ Day (translated by Susan Massotty), a film-maker, Arthur Daane, observes that the Dutch word for history,geschiedenis, contains the suffixnis, a word that also means niche. A niche in history, he thinks, might be a place to keep things or to find them. In a Nooteboom book, history is inscribed everywhere: in love affairs, in the ageing body, in monuments, in conversation, in silence, in stone. The writing is wry, lucid, often comic and always attentive.Nooteboom’s work holds an unusual and personal place in my life. More than 20 years ago, I arrived home from university to find a message on the answering machine. Listening, I understood that something terrible had happened. I tried to call my family but could not reach anyone. Frightened, I sat down and opened the book nearest to me, All Souls’ Day. I had only 20 pages left to read, and I hid inside these pages, reading slowly as if a book of fiction could keep the next hour, or even the next moment, at bay. When the phone rang again, I had six pages left. I got up to answer it. I was told that my mother had died. She had suffered heart failure a few hours earlier, in the night. She had been away on a work trip and by the time her colleagues found her, she was gone.View image in fullscreenGlimpses of history dissolving from memory … Nooteboom in 2012.Photograph: Barbara Zanon/Getty ImagesSoon after, I left Canada and lived for a time in theNetherlandsbefore embarking on a life of movement. For years, I kept All Souls’ Day with me even though I had no intention of finishing it. It was a piece of the past that I carried. But 15 years later, I took it down from the shelf and found the place where I had stopped.In the last pages of the novel, Nooteboom describes a cemetery where hundreds of women, accompanied by their children, are tending the graves of their loved ones. They are embracing one another. The graveyard floats free, gathering up the women and the children and the flowers. Untethered from the earth, it is a “dream world stretching out to the horizon” and a “ship of joy”. You never leave the dead entirely, Arthur thinks. Someone must bring the flowers, someone must mark the single day, 2 November, that is the possession of all souls.Through his books, Nooteboom taught me how we might write about history and also hold ourselves accountable to the present. His voice bristles with passion, wit and melancholy. For most of his life, he returned repeatedly to Spain. In this country, which seemed to hold up a mirror to his deepest self, he wrote about the journeys that had marked him.Nooteboom taught me how we might write about history and also hold ourselves accountable to the presentAmong those travels was a journey to Iran in the spring of 1975. “The key word is old,” he writes. “You approach Persia with blind western arrogance and are confronted by thousands of years of history without any point of reference. The last thing you ever learned was Xerxes, but what about all those centuries that came afterwards?” In the city of Isfahan, attempting to describe a dome made of stone and earth yet somehow transparent, he almost gives up the task: “I cannot fathom it.” But then, restlessly moving, he enters a forest of stone pillars. “There is light everywhere,” he writes, “floating, pooling, piercing, threading; the very stones have been embroidered with it, pigeons fly in and out of it.” He says that even the most opulent dynasty might turn out to be “but a scratch on the great stone of history”. He writes about the shah, about political prisoners, about torture and grief, and what may yet come.Who am I to be here? he often asks. In Nomad’s Hotel, he describes the traveller like this: “It’s a game, he knows it is both true and untrue, he is assembling falsehoods to make a plausible past. The game is called continuity, and contrary to what other people think he does not reject the contemporary world, but wishes to shore it up – memory and recognition being the tools.” But even this recognition might impede our sight, as when we move closer to examine a detail and the surrounding world dissolves. Our travels, Nooteboom observes, might require more than we know how to give: “To find what he is looking for he has acquired an extra forehead, covered in eyes.”Perhaps all the Nooteboom works are about history’s niches, where much lies in wait or is lost for good. To learn to be a traveller, he wrote, is to know that one is both an absence and a presence.Nooteboom, though lauded for decades, and often mentioned as a contender for the Nobel prize, never seems to have been widely read in English. Readers such as myself stumbled upon him by chance, or by good luck, when his works were pressed into our hands by Dutch and German friends. His novel came to me when I needed it most, and I have returned to it, and to all his books, as if to an ever-enlivening conversation. I feel as if I lost a friend. But Daane reminds himself at the end of All Souls’ Day: someone must bring the flowers. Here, then, are mine.This article was amended to include the English translators.Explore more on these topicsBooksNetherlandsHistory booksFictionTravel writingcommentShareReuse this content"

Snippets of gossip expose the divisions in a migrant community in this polyphonic portrait of contemporary AmericaLucy AtkinsFri 13 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleThere has been debate lately about whether novels should cater for our cauterised attention spans. If that means narratives constructed in short chunks that can be consumed in five-minute bursts on a phone – intelligent, but with plenty of cliffhangers and well-timed packets of information to keep us coming back – then Good People ticks all the boxes.Patmeena Sabit’s debut is constructed from a chorus of short testimonies – none more than a few pages, some just a few lines – about the death of Zorah Sharaf, an Afghan American teenager who has drowned in a canal at the wheel of the family car. We hear from family, friends and those in the wider community – neighbours, teachers, schoolmates, journalists, the guy who found the body – as well as those involved in the investigation (though very little from the police), and bites of media commentary. A picture slowly forms of a devastated family, but what kind of family was it? Versions are multiple and contradictory. The Sharafs are perfect, loving, tight-knit. They are dangerously dysfunctional.The novel is, in essence, a crime mystery in which a community turns detective and puts a grieving family on trial. It is also a sharp portrait of an immigrant community in the modern United States, an anatomy of poisonous gossip and a commentary on wider societal divisions. Most of all, though, it is awfully addictive.We learn, from all these snappy voices and snippets, that Zorah’s parents, Rahmat and Maryam, arrived in the US from Kabul in the late 1990s with nothing. They had four children: Zorah, her older brother, and two much younger siblings. Rahmat worked night and day, and weathered several business failures before his cleaning enterprise took off. He is now a multimillionaire entrepreneur in international imports and fast food franchises; they are living the American dream in an upmarket Virginia neighbourhood. But success sparks envy, and money cannot erase cultural tensions. It is not simple for these devoted, obsessive parents to honour their community, culture and values while raising modern American teenagers who will fit in at high school, and – most importantly – Ivy League colleges.I wolfed down Good People in two sittings – it kept me stimulated, never bored, though not really nourished eitherSome of the narrative voices return repeatedly, but they never fully individuate – that isn’t the point. Their heft is collective. They sway us this way and that, presenting new information, judgments, contradictions, hints, revelations, questions and, of course, verdicts. The Sharafs are kind, supportive parents. No, they are harsh and punitive – basically child abusers. Zorah’s big brother was her best friend. No, he was a weirdo, a loner, her worst enemy. Everyone agrees that Zorah was beautiful, smart and popular; her girlfriends were always welcomed in the Sharaf household for sleepovers. But Zorah was never allowed to sleep at their houses, or go to parties, or on school trips, or to spend time with, let alone date, boys. The cultural dissonance builds, as does the pressure. Zorah starts skipping high school, faking report cards. Then she meets an unsuitable boy.We never hear directly from Zorah, her parents or siblings, but they begin to feel very real as we see their love for one another, their courage and resilience, as well as their fears and tensions. The narrative device allows Sabit to manipulate the reader wildly: a contradiction is timed to destabilise, a new perspective brings whiplash and we become complicit because we too pass judgment, piece half facts together, suspect, critique – condemn. But there are also times when the form is overstretched. Do we really need so much from a forensic meteorologist on Fulton County rainfall, a road safety specialist explaining the danger of hydroplaning or the Speedy Stop gas attendant?The most intriguing thing about Good People is not its polyphonic structure but the growing sense of an organising consciousness reeling back and forth between loving loyalty and rage: love for the complex Afghan community that is capable of generosity, care and support; fury at the judgment and misogyny, the violence, the absolutism. This fluctuating energy is compelling because it feels entirely true.How did Zorah end up in the canal? Did the Mercedes spin out of control on a wet road at night? Or is this something heinous, a so-called “honour killing”, father or brother – or maybe a jealous member of the Afghan community – punishing a young woman for stepping out of her box? Sabit toys with us, shoving us this way and that until the need for an answer feels really urgent. Gratification, however, is elusive. What follows is a mild deflation.Good People’s structure is both its strength and its greatest limitation. The narrative feeds us, morsel after morsel, so we never have to work too hard; and while there is stimulating cultural commentary, the structure prevents any deeper emotional, interior journey of character. I wolfed down Good People in two sittings. It kept me stimulated, educated and definitely not bored, though not really nourished either – but that, of course, is how we live now. People, good and bad, are going to love it.Good People by Patmeena Sabit is published by Virago (£16.99). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Nowhere House was in a remote American mountain valley; when it burned down, the terrible crimes committed by Hollywood star Leaf Winham against young men were revealed. Subsequently, runaway children turned the valley into a fortress, surviving on food they could catch or grow, with occasional forays into the towns below. Riley has heard the rumours, but it is only when she sees a green-clad boy – or is it a girl? – hovering outside her bedroom window offering directions on how to find Nowhere that she realises this might be her chance to escape and save her little brother from their sadistic guardian. Her experiences are interwoven with stories from others drawn there: Marc, a journalist determined to get inside the fortress; Adam, the only one of Leaf’s victims to survive; the pioneers who built the first house in the valley, and more. A dark, grimly compelling and very twisty tale.View image in fullscreenPagansby James Alistair Henry (Moonflower, £9.99)In this entertaining alt-history debut, we are in a 21st-century Britain where the Norman conquest never happened, split along religious and cultural lines. The Saxons are led by the High King, who rules the greater part of England; Scotland is behind a wall, allied to the Nordic Economic Union; and the indigenous Celts are second-class citizens. In the buildup to a London summit to discuss plans for British unity, a Celtic negotiator is found dead, nailed to a tree in Epping Forest. Detective Captain Aedith Mercia of the London police teams up with Drustan of the Dumnonian tribal police in a search for what seems to be a religiously motivated serial killer; they find evidence there could be a greater political threat. It’s a great read, combining clever world-building with engaging characters and an exciting story, and ending with a promise of more to come.Pedro the Vastby Simón López Trujillo, translated by Robin Myers (Scribe, £9.99)This short, intense novel by an award-winning Chilean author is speculative fiction about an ominous change to human life as we know it in the wake of ecological destruction. Four forestry workers are struck by a fungal infection affecting their brains. The sole survivor wakes from a coma; speaking with a new voice about being part of a greater whole rather than one sinful individual, he is declared a prophet by a religious cult. Told through alternating viewpoints, moving between conscious and unconscious experience, from the daily lives of an impoverished rural family to a scientist investigating fungal life, it is an unsettling, hallucinogenic trip that lingers in the mind.View image in fullscreenOperation Bounce Houseby Matt Dinniman (Michael Joseph, £22)The colony planet of New Sonora was originally settled by convicts and political dissidents; now their adult grandchildren are hard-working farmers on the brink of a new era as the opening of a Transfer Gate above the planet will allow instant travel between New Sonora and Earth. Our hero, young Oliver Lewis, learns that an eviction order has been served on the planet, and action planned to eliminate any “terrorists” remaining. A variety of war machines arrive, but no soldiers. The government has outsourced planet clearance to a company that manufactures video games: the killing machines will be controlled by excited young gamers back on Earth. The farmers now designated as targets have no weapons; they can only reprogramme their agricultural drones for protection and try to convince the people of Earth that they’re just like them. An entertaining story that skewers an uncomfortable aspect of today’s world: “Imagine a war where all the soldiers are actually paying money for the chance to fight in it. It’s brilliant.”A Beast Slinks Towards Beijingby Alice Evelyn Yang (Dead Ink, £11.99)This debut novel from a Chinese American writer uses a magical-realist lens to examine some of the darker strands of 20th-century Chinese history and the legacy of generational trauma. Qianze has had no contact with her father since he abandoned the family on her 14th birthday. When he turns up 11 years later, babbling about a prophecy, she is horrified, but compelled to be the “good Chinese daughter” and take care of him. Eventually, he reveals her family’s hidden history, and not only does he recall his own shameful experiences as a child during Mao’s Cultural Revolution, he’s able to channel the memories of his parents from years before he was born. Beautifully written, the novel seamlessly blends elements of the supernatural with everyday life, creating a powerful multitonal tale of cruelty, pain, love and survival.Explore more on these topicsBooksScience fiction roundupFantasy booksHorror booksScience fiction booksreviewsShareReuse this content"

And yet the standout star of Emerald Fennell’s new film isn’t one of its smouldering young lovers, played by Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, but British television’s most affable grump – Martin Clunes.Clunes plays Mr Earnshaw, the patriarch of the Earnshaw household whose decision to bring home a destitute young Heathcliff from Liverpool to the Yorkshire Moors sets in motion the destructive love story at the centre of Wuthering Heights. In Fennell’s reworking, Cathy’s elder brother, Hindley, is abolished entirely, with his cruelty, boozing and gambling folded into the father instead.“He’s rotten to the core,” Clunes told ITV’s This Morning recently. “He’s sort of drinking from the start. He’s a devout misogynist. He’s got a gambling addiction and is covered in vomit.”View image in fullscreenMargot Robbie as Cathy and Jacob Elordi as Heathcliffe in a scene from Wuthering Heights.Photograph: APIt is a far cry from the roles that have defined Clunes’s career, and one he has described as both “exciting” and “scary” – not least for the prospect of stepping on to a blockbuster film set. Critics, however, suggest the risk has paid off. “As a child, young Cathy Earnshaw is a pert miss, indulged by her roistering old twinkly eyed squire of a dad, in which role Martin Clunes pretty much pinches the whole film,”wrote the Guardian’s film criticPeter Bradshaw.Born in Wimbledon in 1961, Clunes is the nephew of the actor Jeremy Brett, famed for playing Sherlock Holmes in the Granada TV series, and the son of the actor Alec Clunes, who died when Clunes was eight. Clunes has spoken about having to suppress his grief as a child in the face of British stiffness. “The expectation was, ‘Oh, come on, let’s not cry. Let’s be grown up’,”he said last year. “How grown up can you be at eight?”Soon afterwards, Clunes was sent to Barfield boarding school in Surrey because his paternal grandparents feared growing up without a father figure would make him gay. “So then I had to not cry and not wet the bed at boarding school, which was just impossible,” he said.He drifted into acting, studying drama at the ArtsEd theatre school before working in repertory theatre. During a performance at Hampstead theatre, he was spotted by Harry Enfield, who cast him in his sketch shows and later recommended him for the role of Gary Strang in Simon Nye’s sitcom Men Behaving Badly. The beer-guzzling, woman-chasing Gary, played oppositeNeil Morrissey, made Clunes a household name and earned him a Bafta in 1996.View image in fullscreenClockwise from left: Neil Morrissey, Martin Clunes, Caroline Quentin and Leslie Ash in the 90s sitcom Men Behaving Badly.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyThe show was unmistakably of its time – Clunes has since described it as a “silly” and “zeitgeisty” series that got swept up in “that whole Loaded movement”.Throughout the 90s and early 2000s, Clunes worked steadily across film and television, appearing in Staggered, Lorna Doone, A is for Acid, Shakespeare in Love and Saving Grace, as well as leading roles in Goodbye, Mr Chips and the ITV comedy drama William and Mary.But his most defining role arrived in 2004 with Doc Martin, in which he played the curmudgeonly GP Dr Martin Ellingham. Running for 10 series across 18 years, the show established Clunes as a fixture of British television, and still attracts pleas from fans for a revival. Clunes, meanwhile, has insisted he is far sunnier than his onscreen counterpart. “I’ll go around trying to make everyone like me, unless they don’t deserve to like me,” heonce told the Guardian.View image in fullscreenMartin Clunes as the curmudgeonly GP Dr Martin Ellingham in Doc Martin.Photograph: ITV/Rex/ShutterstockIn recent years, he has appeared in Reggie Perrin, Arthur & George, Manhunt, Warren, and last year’s Out There, in which he played a widowed farmer who faces up to county lines drug dealers. Earlier in his career, he supplemented his acting income by modelling for Gilbert and George and voicing Safeway adverts, while also presenting travelogues, documentaries and writing books about his love of animals.Clunes lives in Dorset with his wife, the Doc Martin producer Philippa Braithwaite, five dogs, two cats, and a menagerie of horses and hens. The couple have one daughter, who is studying to be an equine vet. He has been lined up to portray the disgraced BBC presenter Huw Edwards in an upcoming factual drama, Power: The Downfall of Huw Edwards, charting the implosion of one of British television’s most recognisable figures.For now, though, Clunes finds himself improbably at the centre of one of the most talked about films of the year. And in a glossy, sexually charged literary adaptation, no one would have expected his “rotten” patriarch to leave one of the deepest impressions.Explore more on these topicsWuthering HeightsMartin ClunesTelevisionEmerald FennellEmily BrontëMargot RobbieJacob ElordifeaturesShareReuse this content"

William Nicholson’s take on CS Lewis’s marriage to an American divorcee is that of late-found passion, terminal illness and a crisis of the celebrated writer’s Christian faith. In all its iterations, it is an old-fashioned weepie. In this production, originally staged atChichester Festival theatre, it just feels old-fashioned.It has charm and pulls you into its sadness but seems as creaky as the half-filled, wood-panelled library in its backdrop. There is too much a sense of a drama unfolding, from the moment Lewis (Hugh Bonneville) receives a letter from American fan, Joy Davidman (Maggie Siff), to his slow falling in love and her descent into illness.Directed by Rachel Kavanaugh, it plods from one scene to the next, sleepy in pace and action but breezy in its emotions. The loves story seems to sit apart from the thoughts on faith and suffering that Lewis voices at university podium lectures.Bonneville is a lovely presence, as always, and he certainly knows how to play emotionally reserved Englishmen, (there has been the Earl of Grantham in Downton Abbey and the cautious dad from Paddington). But although he channels awkwardness with aplomb, he lacks the hard, anguished depths that show Lewis’s stunting shyness and repression. He also emanates warmth, carrying an almost physical sense that he is, for all Lewis’s inhibitions, a big (bear) hug of a presence on stage. Siff is excellent as Joy, bringing sharp edges and ardour but the chemistry between them is just too fond and gentle.Lewis’s fellow dons at Oxford University are cardboard characters, mouthing viewpoints on God, women – and Joy, whom they regard as an aggressive American – while Peter McKintosh’s set design does little to build this world and bring it to life. It leaves a vacuum in atmosphere, the stage woefully empty.There aresomescenes that penetrate, especially the exhilarating moment that Lewis and Joy declare their love for each other, circling around the other. The rapport between Lewis and his older brother (Jeff Rawle) with whom he lives, is amusing as well. But as a story of love and grief, it should have you in bits. Love found, so late, an emotionally remote man thawed by it, and then lost again, his love an open wound. It does not feel as eviscerating as it should.Nicholson’s script is adapted from his own Bafta award-winning TV film and that is just what it feels like here: a made for TV tear-jerker.AtAldwych theatre, London, until 9 MayExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreHugh BonnevilleCS LewisreviewsShareReuse this content"

Savage and sweet and entirely strange, The Shitheads transports us back tens of thousands of years, to a time when survival required good aim with your hand axe, and squeamishness would not serve you well.Early humans Clare (Jacoba Williams, slippery and wild) and Greg (Jonny Khan, puppyishly excitable) meet on the hunt for an elk (a beautiful raggedy creature designed by Finn Caldwell and captained by Scarlet Wilderink, absolutely alive – until it is not). Never having met anyone like the other, they are both in awe of their opposing perceptions of time and the future, of living and dying. Worthy of a licked thumb.David Byrne and Aneesha Srinivasan direct with a thirst for blood and a delight in playful, prehistoric oddity. Interactions between characters are wide-eyed and primal, a sense of wonder accompanying their blunt peculiarities. With chatty, often simplified speech, Nicholls builds a world reliant on spears and seeds while encapsulating the grandness of what it means to dream, to listen and to fight for your survival.View image in fullscreenBeautifully raggedy … the elk puppet in The Shitheads.Photograph: Camilla GreenwellClare has grown up in a cave protecting her eager little sister Lisa, who if left to hunt anything larger than a rabbit would be flattened in seconds (played with bounding energy by Annabel Smith), and their father (Peter Clements, wonderfully menacing), an ailing man who has built his girls’ worlds on myths of the other, “shithead” people outside. They can’t talk, he says. They’re stupid. Their dreams become yours, he says, if you eat them. But here is Greg, telling Clare a story and dismantling her reality. And here comes Danielle (Ami Tredrea, rugged and wary), Greg’s partner, climbing down into Clare’s cave.Choosing wild imagination over accuracy, Anna Reid’s design artfully merges red-dust cave paintings with armchairs and lamps, and bones dangling down as decoration. The story seems to escape the confines of this stony home, grandeur demanded of its gruesomeness. Discovered through the Royal Court’s Open Submissions scheme, The Shitheads demonstrates the joy of greater risks being taken on our stages. The end would benefit from a trim, but this feral story soars with untamed life.At theRoyal Court theatre, London, until 14 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreRoyal Court theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

And so, in Jonathan Lynn’s elegiac swansong for his well-loved sitcom duo, Hacker calls upon his old consigliere Sir Humphrey to rescue him from trouble one last time.View image in fullscreenSpirited support … Stephanie Levi-John in I’m Sorry, Prime Minister.Photograph: Johan PerssonLynn (who wrote the original with the late Antony Jay) directs too, alongside Michael Gyngell, a production first staged in 2023at the Barn in Cirencester. Its ambition, as Hacker’s care worker Sophie telegraphs by quotingShelley’s Ozymandias, is to examine the mighty once they have fallen. Whither Hacker and Sir Humphrey, now exiled from the corridors of power, hanging on to a world they now barely understand? The latter is condemned to a care home, indeed, by his “evil queen” daughter-in-law. There is poignancy in that, but it’s not dwelled upon in a show that majors not in depth of feeling, far less dramatic incident, but in urbane wit and the illicit thrill of hearing old codgers say inappropriate things.At its worst, it’s less a play than a vehicle for Lynn and his characters to discourse, not very insightfully, on trigger warnings and safe spaces. Stephanie Levi-John does spiritedly in the thankless role of Sophie, forever correcting her elders’ improprieties. Rhys Jones and Clive Francis as Sir Humphrey are a treat, too, the former blithering and pompous, the latter a delicious mixture of vulnerability and shrewdness – frail enough to give the stairlift a go, but with his skill intact for filibustering prolixity.Their predicament here is low-stakes and not a great deal happens, as they bat conversational gambits back and forth (“Humphrey, why were you so keen on austerity?”) But Lynn’s perspective is arresting on age, irrelevance and their levelling effects – and the characters’ company is as charming as ever.AtApollo theatre, London, until 9 May.Explore more on these topicsTheatreComedyGriff Rhys JonesreviewsShareReuse this content"

He now comes home to the UK; literally with this four-show residency at Alexandra Palace in London, and also in the musical homages he pays on the opening night.In succession, Gibson plays Arctic Monkeys’ When the Sun Goes Down, a techno mix of EsDeeKid’s 4 Raws, and a blend from Spice’s dancehall track So Mi Like It to the Chariots of Fire theme over a drum’n’bass beat – comedy patriotism, but very enjoyable for it, and all showing absolute disregard for any sense of purism in electronic music.He begins his five-hour set at 5.30pm, interspersing his own discography with back-to-back sets with Hamdi, Oppidan and Nia Archives. It’s not the euphoric “hug-the-stranger-next-to-you” of his Actual Life albums; it’s dark, heavy jungle and UK garage. Gibson’s love of London rap, from drill to conscious, is then made clear with a series of star guests: on new track Lights Burn Dimmer, Jamie T would make Mike Skinner proud; Berwyn delivers a braggadocious BerwynGesaffNeighbours; Blanco gets lost in himself on Solo.Later, jazz quintet Ezra Collective are joined by Argentine hip-hop duo Ca7riel and Paco Amoroso for a triumphant, pulsating performance of Beto’s Horns. Gibson’s production feels like a skeleton key for these collaborators, unlocking their best work: the sometimes impassive Headie One is energised and excitable on Smoke, Back to Basics and Ain’t It Different.In-demand producer Fred again.. : ‘I was fortunate not to be good at anything else’Read moreLondon is the natural home for Gibson’s garage and drum’n’bass tracks, but the more introspective and tender Adore U, Danielle (Smile on My Face) and a mix of Dermot Kennedy’s For Island Fires and Family and Lost, into Dermot (See Yourself in My Eyes), are some of the best received.At the outset, to prevent people filming instead of dancing, members of the audience were given stickers to put on their phone cameras – which lasted all of five seconds.

Writing, producing and arranging all her own work, she weaves together neo-soul silk, R&B groove, indie edge, and flashes of grunge, all carried by a buttery falsetto that nods to Aaliyah, Amy Winehouse, Janet Jackson and early Destiny’s Child.Born in north-west London to a Nigerian father raised on Motown and gospel, and a Trinidadian-Indian mother spinning calypso and funk, Natanya began learning classical piano at the age of four. She grew up absorbing church bands, the fruits of YouTube rabbit holes, wrestling entrance themes, and late-night bedroom beats made on whatever gear she could get her hands on.Her 2023 debut EP Sorrow at Sunrise read like torn-out diary pages, filled with raw heartbreak and uni life confessions layered over lush, experimental production. In 2025, she swung bigger with Feline’s Return and its Act II extension, pairing bolder pop instincts with soulful depth.Cosigns from SZA, Tyler, the Creator, Doechii and Janet Jackson show she’s turning heads as she’s carving out her own lane. With a short break planned to let her reset for the rest of 2026, Natanya has her growing fanbase (known as the felines) wrapped around her finger.Sik FrydasThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenRhythmic nimbleness … Mei Semones, right, with Liana Flores.Photograph: Taisei SunakawaMei Semones – Koneko (ft Liana Flores)With lyrics in three languages, and the same rhythmic nimbleness as a prog or math-rock band, Semones and Flores craft a dizzyingly lovely song rooted in classic Brazilian bossa nova.BBTRoy Montgomery – Pyromantic IdeationThe sublime New Zealand guitarist recorded the excellently titled Guitars Infernal in 2016 against various personal griefs, but waited until this aptly hellish moment to release it: bask in its ecstatic, splintered static.

Converge’s 2001 breakthrough Jane Doe remainsthemasterpiece of the genre’s pre-bastardisation days: vicious as a pit bull, yet played by men unafraid to test the limits, as evidenced by the tormented, 11-minute title track. The New Englanders have never rested on their laurels, either, with subsequent releases emphasising different shades of their trademark anarchy.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Love Is Not EnoughThe band’s 10th album and first in nine years (Chelsea Wolfe collaboration Bloodmoon: I not included), Love Is Not Enough condenses their carnage, intricacies and emotional pangs into their shortest-ever run time. Distract and Divide and To Feel Something are incensed and tightly arranged, as if Napalm Death and Slayer had joined forces to strangle you through the speakers.There’s much more than anger to this 30-minute onslaught. We Were Never the Same unloads pure adrenaline with its tapping guitar melody, whereas Beyond Repair is an ominous interlude that makes the snare strikes of follow-up track Amon Amok hit like a rugby tackle. Make Me Forget You stabs with devastation rather than physical rage, with Jacob Bannon screaming in anguish over a whirring riff.It’s rare for a metal band to still sound fresh this long after forming, and even rarer when they’ve spent almost all of their career in one subgenre. But Converge have a seemingly bottomless well of inspiration. Masters of metalcore, in 2001 and 2026 alike.Explore more on these topicsMetalPop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

It opens with Palimpsest, a skittering, polystylistic hurly-burly, and concludes with the abrasive stabs and jabs of the rhythmic Passacaille.

The biographer William Feaver recounts the anecdote as Freud told it to him: Bacon had stood up, undone the buttons on his trousers, rolled up his sleeves and wiggled his hips a little, saying: “I think you ought to do this, because I think that’s rather important.”By Freud’s own admission, the older painter was provocative in more ways than just this pose: “I got very impatient with the way I was working. It was limited and a limited vehicle for me,” Freud told Feaver. He felt his drawing stopped him from freeing himself, he said, “and I think my admiration for Francis came into this. I realised that by working in the way I did I couldn’t really evolve. The change wasn’t perhaps more than one of focus, but it did make it possible for me to approach the whole thing in another way.”Trace with your eye the curves and precision of those three line drawings and “limited” is the very last adjective that springs to mind. They are magnificent. What Freud’s comments belie is the tireless striving that lends all his work such power.He’s finding things out, he’s exploring, and it’s a quicker route with a pencil or charcoal than the whole oil spectrumThis trio are among the 175 paintings and works on paper at the National Portrait Gallery’s exhibitionLucian Freud: Drawing into Painting. Drawing, for Freud, was many things. It was how he wrote letters as a kid, how he broke in canvases (a rough ghostly image that would disappear under the paint), solved problems (going to the National Gallery late at night to look at specific works), and painted without paint (all those meaty etchings from the 1980s onwards). It was also often what he did after he had, as his former assistant David Dawson puts it, “painted himself out of a painting”. Curator Sarah Howgate points to several pen-and-inks and charcoals on paper that relate to Large Interior, W11 (after Watteau), that monumental canvas he did between 1981 and 1983. Many of the drawings, Howgate says, “were a response to the finished painting; they weren’t preparatory workings out”.Dawson, who worked for Freud from the early 1990s and is the last person of whom he made a portrait, says that drawing after the fact was about the artist’s unending quest for a direct line from the heart to the eye to the hand to the canvas: “He’s finding things out, he’s exploring, and it’s a quicker route to explore with a pencil or charcoal than the whole oil spectrum.”It is also the most exacting. “He always said you can never lie with drawing,” says Dawson. “Whereas with paint, it’s such an attractive medium, you can slightly smudge things, if you cut corners – which he never did, but youcan. You can fake it a bit with paint. You can’t with drawing.”Lucian Freud: Drawing Into Paintingisat the National Portrait Gallery, London,to 4 May.Pencilled in: five images from the exhibitionPortrait of a Young Man, 1944 (main picture)Howgate highlights the directness of artist John Craxton’s gaze here, and the incredible detail in Freud’s rendering of the man’s hair, the weave of his jacket, the soft folds of his cravat. His use of white chalk on coloured paper recalls Ingres, and art historian Herbert Read’s assessment of Freud as “the Ingres of existentialism”View image in fullscreenBella in her Pluto T-Shirt (etching), 1995.Photograph: © The Lucian Freud Archive.

I think that’s less the case with Lucian.” Freud spoke often of his subject’s inner life being important. They weren’t just blanks for him to fill in. Instead, he made their private universes tangible.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: National Portrait Gallery, London/The Lucian Freud Archive/Bridgeman ImagesSolicitor’s Head, 2003Freud would work standing less than a metre from where his subject was variously lying on the bed, or on the floor, or seated on a chair, and, says Dawson, “he’d come up really close to you, like, really close”. If his process was very internalised, you were aware of his nervous anxiety. “It wasn’t relaxed. And that kept you as a sitter slightly on edge because he didn’t quite know … He was battling with himself every day.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: The Lucian Freud Archive/Bridgeman ImagesDavid Hockney, 2002Included in the exhibition are a selection of paintings that show the dialogue between Freud’s works on paper and on canvas. For this portrait, Hockney would walk through Holland Park to see Freud and sit “for 120 hours, as he loves to say,” says Howgate. He did a drawing of Freud, too, which is also in theNational Portrait Gallerycollection, but, as Dawson puts it, Freud only gave David 45 minutes “and then walked out”.Explore more on these topicsLucian FreudArtExhibitionsNational Portrait GalleryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If you were approaching his painstaking canvases out of curiosity – how to construct the figure, capture precise perspective, proportions – I can see how their visible workings (complex little dashes and crosses and plumb lines and geometric grids) would prove revelatory. But lots of us come to art to be inspired, transported, to feel. And for all their technical prowess, Uglow’s 70-odd regimented paintings at MK Gallery leave me cold.View image in fullscreenFlashes of life … Marigold, 1969.Photograph: © The estate of Euan Uglow. All rights reserved 2025, Bridgeman ImagesFirst, some context, which we get immediately upon entering – in a slightly maddening move, the five-room retrospective of the artist opens with a room of seven paintings, of which only two are by him. After studying at the Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts in London from 1948 to 1950, he moved to the Slade. He was influenced by Paul Cézanne and Alberto Giacometti, as well as three tutors, all of whom are represented here.Things pick up in the following room, which brings Uglow, who died in 2000 aged 68, into better focus. In 1959 he rented a studio in Battersea, London, and began to develop his own style – painstakingly devised paintings based on intense observation. In the early works are flickers of life. There, in the beautifully plump and juicy beads strung around the slender neck of his friend, Gloria Ceccone, and the bright flashes of cerulean and ochre bursting against black in the striking portrait of the Ghanaian painter and activist, Marigold.I’m warming to him until I come face to face with the first of a series of large-scale nudes, this one spliced and diced in a way that makes me think of a meat cleaver. Which is bizarre, really, because there’s nothing meaty about Uglow’s naked women, a world apart from his more popular London contemporaries Frank Auerbach, Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud. If anything, you could compare them to carcasses, any fleshiness picked off the bones, which jut out at awkward angles. The central room is devoted to nudes reclining on one wall and standing on the other, a frieze of female form. Frieze, or freeze: the word that springs to mind is static. The left breast of the woman in Root Five Nude(1974-75) is upright and stiff, when surely it should be flopped over.View image in fullscreenLong division … Three in One, 1967-68.Photograph: © The estate of Euan Uglow. All rights reserved 2025, Bridgeman ImagesLike Freud, Uglow made huge demands on his models, scrutinising them for days, weeks, months,years. He used three models for Three in One (1967-68) – a ghostly white outline hints at the arm of a previous girl, while the clunky white heater hovering above underscores the artist’s chillingly laboured process. Just look at the dates: The Diagonal (1971-77), an extraordinarily elegant and at the same time excruciating image of a long, lean model stretched plank-like on a folding chair across a horizontal canvas, took six years. It wasn’t uncommon for his sitters to bow out partway through a picture.Which is what happened with Cherie Blair, who appears twice, the second time semi-naked in an open blue shift dress (the tabloids had a field day when the portrait came to light). A trainee barrister, she was introduced to Uglow by her head of chambers, and posed for him before realising she didn’t have the time that Uglow demanded of her. Hanging beside her unfinished portrait is a more polished canvas modelled by a substitute.View image in fullscreenIt wasn’t uncommon for his sitters to bow out partway through a picture … Snake, 1976.Photograph: © The estate of Euan Uglow. All rights reserved 2025, Bridgeman ImagesThere are moments of brilliance. The pinkish sole of the right foot in Pepe’s Painting(1984-85) is intimate and tender, and there’s masses of character in the adamantly flexed left foot of that model in The Diagonal. But the pink legs of the striding model in Zagi (1981-82), seemingly on the brink of movement, look as if they’ve just emerged from a too-hot bath. And Nuria(1998-2000) is a Sarah Lucas bunny without the humour.Which is the trouble with Uglow. He takes himself so very seriously. He once said: “I want the brain to intervene between the observation and the mark.” Another often-quoted line: “The proper subject of a painting is painting itself. It’s not what gets painted that matters, it’s how.”That may be what mattered to the artist, but it doesn’t always make for an enriching viewing experience. It’s true that, in the age of AI, there is something reassuring, even rousing, about seeing the time and effort he put into his pictures – but too much methodology sucks the life out of art.The exhibition ends with a series of still lifes: a quite lovely daisy; a lonely plastic cake, which does nothing for me after seeing Wayne Thiebaud’s creamy andmoreish slices at the Courtauldlast year; a toy palm tree (your guess is as good as mine); a slumped and spoiled peach.For a brief moment, I wonder if I’m witnessing a glimmer of self-parody when I read the title of the final work on show: Mouse Loaf (1991-92). Uglow worked on the painting for more than a year, insisting on his uncompromisingly fastidious approach even as the mound of bread was gradually nibbled by rodents. To prevent it from collapsing, the artist filled it with plaster. Life chewed cold.Euan Uglow: An Arc from the Eye is atMK Gallery, Milton Keynes, from 14 February to 31 MayExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtPaintingreviewsShareReuse this content"

I, for one, am keen to usher that horse in, and to celebrate I’ll be making this noodle salad, which is a variation on one I first ate at Mandy Yin’s restaurant,Sambal Shiok. It’s a dish that’s eaten across Malaysia and Singapore, and the idea is that everyone around the table tosses the salad high into the air at the same time: the superstition goes that the higher the salad is tossed, the more luck will ensue. Come on, Nelly.Prosperity toss noodle saladDried beancurd sticks (and pink sushi ginger) can be found in Chinese supermarkets or online. When soaked, they become like chewy thinly sliced tofu. This recipe is all in the preparation: the only cooking is frying the beancurd sticks and cashews and boiling the noodles. You’ll need a large lipped bowl or platter (big enough to serve four from) and four pairs of chopsticks.Prep15 minCook50 minServes4120g dried beancurd skin sticks, broken into 4cm pieces6 clementines, 2 peeled and sliced into rounds, 4 juiced, to get 8 tbsp3 tbsp rice vinegar2 tbsp light soy sauce4 tsp toasted sesame oil8 tbsp rapeseed oil150g dried wheat noodles100g roasted cashews, choppedFine sea salt2 small red chicory(275g), halved lengthways and thinly sliced30g fresh coriander, roughly chopped30g bunch mint, leaves picked and chopped30g pickled pink sushi ginger, drained and thinly sliced4 tbsp crispy fried onionsPut the broken beancurd skin sticks in a heatproof bowl, pour over boiling water, poke the beancurd so it’s all submerged, then leave to soak for 30 minutes until soft. Slice one stick to make sure it’s cooked all the way through and not crunchy in the middle, then drain well.To make the dressing, in a small bowl whisk the clementine juice, rice vinegar, soy sauce, two teaspoons of toasted sesame oil and four tablespoons of rapeseed oil.Meanwhile, cook the noodles according to the packet instructions, then drain and rinse them under cold water. Drain again, then dress with two tablespoons of rapeseed oil and put to one side.Put the cashews in a cold pan, then set it over a medium heat and toast for about five minutes, stirring often, until nicely browned all over. Tip into a bowl.Warm the remaining two tablespoons of rapeseed oil in the same pan and, when it’s hot, add the drained beancurd skins, half a teaspoon of salt and the remaining two teaspoons of sesame oil. Cook for five minutes, until the beancurd starts to crisp up, then take off the heat.To assemble, put the noodles in the centre of a lipped bowl, arrange the chicory, herbs, beancurd skin, clementine slices and pickled ginger around the outside, then scatter over the cashews and crispy onions. Pour over the dressing, then encourage everyone to arm themselves with chopsticks and toss the salad together – and, if willing, shout, “Lo Hei!”Explore more on these topicsVegetablesMeera Sodha recipesFoodVegan food and drinkNoodlesSaladChinese food and drinkMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

I might be biased, but, unusually, I am inclined to agree with them. As my eldest puts it, “New clothes, cash, boozeandfood – what’s not to love?” There’s the added bonus that cash is absolutely more than acceptable – in fact, it’s de rigueur, so there’s no shopping for mundane socks and smelly candles. Chinese new year is full of rituals and, just as at Christmas, every family has its own, but they are all variations on a theme. Symbolism looms large in Chinese culture, and at new year it centres around messages of prosperity, luck and family. Symbolism extends naturally to the food, too. The word for “fish’” in Chinese, Mandarin and Cantonese sounds a lot like the word for “surplus”, so to have fish is to have an abundance, to have more than one needs, while dumplings represent wealth on account of their shape. I hope you enjoy these abundantly wealth-wishing recipes.Kung hei fat choi!Steamed sea bass with spring onion and ginger (pictured top)This is one of the most popular dishes atour restaurant in Somerset House, central London. The ingredients list and method is simple, but timing is everything. Timing and freshness.Prep15 minCook15 minServes4For the light stock5-6 coriander stalks1 spring onion1-2 slices fresh ginger1 pinch each salt and ground white pepper¼ tsp sugarFor the fish1 whole sea bass(at least 400g), cleaned, rinsed and dried2-3 spring onions, trimmed and finely julienned60g fresh ginger, peeled and finely juliennedSea salt and white pepper1 dash Shaoxing wine30g coriander leaves1 small ladle (about 60ml) hot neutral vegetable oil, to finishSteamed jasmine rice, to serveFor the sauce50ml light soy sauce60ml light stock– see above and methodFirst, make the stock. Put all the ingredients in a small pan, add about 80ml water and bring to a simmer. Cook for eight to 10 minutes, until fragrant, then keep warm.Take the fish out of the fridge at least 15 minutes before you want to cook it, and make an incision close to the dorsal fin, which will help it cook evenly. Stuff a small handful of the sliced spring onions and ginger in its belly, then season with sea salt, ground white pepper and a splash of Shaoxing wine.Put the fish in a steamer, cover and leave to cook – as a rough guide, it’ll need about six minutes per 600g fish; it’s done when you can easily poke through the thickest part of the fish with a chopstick. Meanwhile, mix the light soy sauce into the hot fragrant stock.Carefully lift the fish on to a platter and remove and discard the ginger and spring onion from its belly. Garnish generously with the remaining julienned spring onion and ginger and some coriander.Dress the fish with the stock and light soy mixture, then pour a ladleful of sizzling-hot vegetable oil all over the spring onion and ginger topping, so the spring onion wilts. Serve immediately with steamed jasmine rice.Chicken and Chinese mushroom potstickersView image in fullscreenAmy Poon’s chicken and Chinese mushroom potstickers.Gather your friends and family, and re-enactthe dumpling-wrapping scene from Crazy Rich Asians. Depending on how big your wrappers are, and how generously you fill your potstickers, this amount of filling should easily make 40-50 potstickers. Hand-chopped chicken thighs are so much better than ready minced chicken, so if you have the time, I’d highly recommend it. Consider it a form of anger management.Prep15 minCook45 minMakes40-50500g boneless and skinless chicken thighs, or chicken mince25g peeled fresh ginger, minced or very finely chopped25ml light soy sauce20g potato starch20ml Shaoxing wine1 tsp sugar½ tsp salt½ tsp ground white pepper15ml sesame oil200g rehydrated Chinese mushrooms(from about 30g dried), drained, squeezed dry and roughly chopped50g spring onions, trimmed and finely choppedStore-bought potsticker wrappers, from Chinese food stores and some large supermarkets (if you want to make your own, work with a ratio of 53% water to all-purpose flour)Neutral oil, for fryingChilli vinegar dressing, or chilli oil, to serveDice the chicken, then, using the back of the knife, hammer the meat until it’s broken down into a rough mince (or use the backs of two knives, one in each hand, and pretend you’re playing the drums).Put the minced chicken in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle, then add the ginger, light soy sauce, potato starch, Shaoxing wine, sugar, salt and white pepper. Mix at a medium speed for about a minute, until everything is well combined, then pour in the sesame oil and mix at high speed for four to six minutes, until the mixture turns sticky and tacky. Add the chopped mushrooms and spring onions, then mix on a medium-low speed until they’re evenly incorporated into the meat mix. Scrape the filling on to a plate.There are many ways to wrap a potsticker, but the most important thing is to seal the filling inside the wrapper so the juices stay inside when it’s cooking. Put about a teaspoon of the filling mixture in the centre of a wrapper, wet the edges of the wrapper with water, then fold over and seal (you’ll need less filling than you think, not least because overstuffed potstickers are hard to seal). Repeat with the remaining filling and wrappers.Put a little oil in a large, hot frying pan for which you have a lid, then arrange the potstickers inside in a single layer, making sure they’re not touching; if need be, cook the dumplings in batches. Leave to fry gently on a medium-low heat until the bottoms start to take on some colour, then loosen the potstickers with a spatula and pour over just enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the potstickers. Immediately cover with a tight-fitting lid, then, still on a medium-low heat, cook for four to five minutes more. Uncover and cook until any residual liquid has evaporated and the bases of the potstickers are toasty brown and crisp.Plate (or not: there’s something particularly satisfying about eating them straight from the pan, much like eating ice-cream out of the tub) and serve with chilli vinegar dressing or your favourite chilli oil for dipping.Amy Poon is the founder of the Chinese heritage food brandPoon’s LondonExplore more on these topicsFoodChickenMeatStarterSnacksLunar new yearFishrecipesShareReuse this content"

Short days, cold evenings and the pressure of everyday work mean that preparation is no longer about producing abundance, but about reducing effort while maintaining care. For many households balancing jobs, children and long commutes, the question is not what to cook, but how to make the month manageable.The most effective approach to Ramadan cooking is not variety but repetition. A small set of meals that are easy to digest, quick to prepare and gentle on the body can carry a household through 30 days of fasting with far less stress than daily reinvention. The aim is to do the thinking once, not every day.At the centre of this approach sits one essential dish: soup.Across cultures, soup is the quiet constant of Ramadan. In winter, it becomes indispensable. Warm, hydrating and calming, it allows the body to transition gently into eating after a long fast. A splitred lentil soupis particularly suited to February fasting. It is affordable, quick to cook and freezes well. One pot prepared at the weekend can last several days, removing the need for daily decisions at sunset.Served hot at iftar, the evening meal that breaks the daily fast, soup slows the pace of eating and settles the stomach before anything else arrives on the table. This is not about tradition for tradition’s sake but function. In colder weather, digestion naturally slows, and soup prepares the body to eat again.Fried food often features at iftar and scale matters. One or two small items are enough. Anything more becomes tiring to cook and heavy to eat night after night. Lebanese sambousek – small pastries filled with minced lamb, onions, parsley and pine nuts – work particularly well because they can be prepared in advance and frozen uncooked. The same applies to simple cheese rolls.Both can be shaped in batches, frozen flat and cooked directly from frozen when needed. The advantage is as much psychological as practical. When the freezer is stocked, there is no sense of last-minute pressure as the fast ends.Heavier fried dishes, such as fried chicken or fish, are best avoided during the week. They require more effort in the kitchen and tend to increase thirst the following day. Ramadan food works best when it is light and predictable.A fresh salad is not an optional extra but a structural part of the meal. It brings hydration, texture and acidity, balancing both soup and fried items.Fattoushremains a reliable choice: herbs, vegetables, crisp bread and lemon. Alternatively, a simple salad with chicken, lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers can stand alone for smaller households.The key is to keep ingredients repeatable and easy to assemble. Washing and storing vegetables at the start of the week turns salad into a matter of minutes rather than another task to negotiate at the end of the day.Rice, if served, should remain uncomplicated. Plain basmati rice, steamed and fluffed, provides comfort without heaviness. Rich, elaborate dishes are better reserved for weekends, when there is more time and less cumulative fatigue.Suhoor, the pre-dawn meal eaten before the fast begins, presents a quieter challenge in winter. Cold weather can disguise dehydration, yet long fasting hours still demand careful hydration. The most effective suhoor foods are simple. Medjool dates soaked 10-15 minutes in milk offer a practical solution. Soft, nourishing and quick, they require no preparation in the early hours. Limiting intake to two or three dates helps avoid sugar spikes and thirst later in the day.Much of this approach depends on one small window of preparation. A single Sunday afternoon can remove most of the strain of the week ahead. Cooking a pot of lentil soup, shaping sambousek, rolling cheese pastries and washing vegetables once creates a rhythm that carries through Ramadan with minimal daily effort.This way of cooking is not about perfection or performance. It is about acknowledging that fasting already demands discipline, and that food should support rather than complicate the month. In winter especially, Ramadan rewards calm repetition. When meals are planned, familiar and gentle, there is more space for rest, reflection and the quieter rhythms that the month invites.Lebaneselambsambousek (pictured above)These sambousek use a soft cream-based dough that is easy to handle and produces a tender, delicate pastry.Makes20–24Prep40 minCook20 minFor the dough300g extra-thick double cream250g – 300gplain flour, plus extra for dustingFor the lamb filling2 tbsp neutraloil1 small onion, finely chopped300g minced lamb2 tbsp pine nuts1 small bunch parsley, finely chopped¼ tsp ground cinnamon¼ tspallspiceSea saltTo make the dough, add the cream and 250g of the flour to a medium bowl. Mix until a soft dough begins to form, then gradually add the remaining flour, a little at a time, until you have a smooth, supple dough that is soft to the touch but not sticky. You may not need all the flour. Cover and set aside to rest for 15 minutes while you prepare the filling.Heat the oil in a frying pan on a medium heat, add the onion and cook for 10 minutes until softened and slightly golden. Add the minced lamb and cook for 10-12 minutes until just browned, breaking it up with a spoon. Stir in the pine nuts, parsley, cinnamon, allspice, and salt to taste. Cook for another minute, then remove from the heat and set aside to cool completely.On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough until it’s 1–1.5 cm thick. Cut out small or medium circles. Place a teaspoon of filling in the centre of each, fold into a crescent and seal the edges by pressing, crimping or using a fork.Freeze in a single layer for up to three months, or fry immediately in hot oil for 3-4 minutes, turning once, until golden and crisp (allow an extra 5 minutes if frying from frozen).LebanesecheeserollsView image in fullscreenLebanese cheese rolls.Photograph: Lina Saad/PRThese crisp rolls appear across the Middle East in various forms and are a staple of the Ramadan table.

This version was heavily inspired by an almond croissant, so although it does lean more towards dessert, I won’t judge if this is what you choose to start your day with. Bake them until the edges go crisp but the middle stays a little gooey.Almond frangipane crepesPrep5 minRest20+ minCook50 minMakes7-8 crepes120g plain flour½ tbsp caster sugarA pinch of salt2 largeeggs240ml whole milk25g melted butter,plus extra for greasingIcing sugar, for dustingLightly whipped cream, to serve (optional)For the frangipane90g salted butter, softened90g caster sugar¼-½ tsp almond extract1 large egg110g ground almonds50g flaked almondsPut the flour, sugar and salt in a bowl and whisk briefly to combine. Add the eggs, whisk to a thick paste, then pour in the milk in three batches, whisking each time to avoid any lumps. Leave the batter to sit at room temperature for at least 20 minutes, but an hour is ideal. Stir the melted butter into the batter.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and line two large baking trays. Put a 22-23cm frying pan on a medium heat and lightly grease it with melted butter. Pour some batter into the centre of the pan, swirling it around to make sure the pan is evenly coated. Cook for 30-40 seconds, then flip over the crepe and cook it on the other side for another 20 seconds. Transfer the crepe to a plate and repeat with the remaining batter.To make the filling, put the butter, sugar and almond extract in a bowl and beat until smooth and slightly pale. Mix in the egg, followed by the ground almonds.Spread about a tablespoon of the frangipane on to each crepe (leaving a small border all around the edge), then fold in half. Fold in half again, this time slightly off-centre, then top with another smidge of frangipane and a small handful of flaked almonds. Arrange the filled crepes on the lined trays and bake for 15 minutes, until the edges look crisp. Serve warm, dusted with icing sugar and with a dollop of cream, if you like.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotPancakesDessertBreakfastBakingrecipesShareReuse this content"
