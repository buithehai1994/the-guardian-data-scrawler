So, up top: I don’t know anyone depicted in The Hack, Jack Thorne’s seven-part drama about Guardian journalist Nick Davies’s investigation into the scandal of the phone-hacking perpetrated by various members of Rupert Murdoch’s News International, which led to seven major police investigations, nearly 40 convictions and the closing of theNews of the World. I’ve never met Davies or the then editor of the paper, with whom the drama is almost as concerned, Alan Rusbridger (beyond a handshake from on high, literally and metaphorically – he’s much taller than Toby Jones, who plays him here – in a crowded tent at Hay-on-Wye 20 years ago). Disclaimer ends. Let’s get cracking!‘We should have been shouting about this earlier’: David Tennant on his shocking TV show about phone hackingRead moreThe Hack opens in 2008, when Davies – played byDavid Tennantwith his customary tension and earnestness, which I always find distractingly effortful, though I remain aware that I am in the minority – is tipped off about the News of the World hacking into the voicemails of celebrities to garner gossip and stories, with pictures and other evidence gathered after the fact to disguise the illegal source. The editor, Andy Coulson, had resigned in the wake of “one rogue reporter” doing so the year before. In fact, the practice is endemic. And Coulson is now director of communications for the then prime minister, David Cameron, which puts the story firmly within the public interest. Davies starts the painstaking business of stacking it up, then re-stacking as it becomes bigger and bigger and the Metropolitan police’s connection – sliding into complicity? cooperation? corruption? – with the tabloids becomes an ever more prominent part of his discoveries over the next six years.View image in fullscreen‘Get it on the record!’ … Toby Jones as then Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger in The Hack.Photograph: ITVThe problem is that stitching together a sprawling story as Davies did is, in televisual terms, very boring – especially when played out across a very indulgent seven-hour run. More failed phone calls. More dead ends. More reluctant celebrities. More lawyers telling him to be patient, more Rusbridger telling him he needs more quotes, more documents, more names on the record. Small breakthroughs. Cowardly silence from the rest of the press. Thorne tries to liven things up with many breakings of the fourth wall by Tennant – wryly commenting on this and that, looking knowingly at the camera, taking part in little dreamlike sequences – but this only undermines any sense that the writer trusts his story and his viewers and further detaches us from a narrative that until the final couple of episodes cannot build up a head of steam.More propulsive is the secondary strand, about detective David Cook (brilliantly played by Robert Carlyle) and his gradual realisation, as he works the murder case of the private investigator Daniel Morgan, of how enmeshed the media and the Metropolitan police were. But they are too long apart for the one to borrow much energy from the other.The Hack is stymied, too, by the fact that unlike, say, another drama about an appalling scandal,Mr Bates vs the Post Office, it deals mostly in ideals (and journalistic ideals at that) rather than the human emotions that make ideals real and valuable to us in life and as viewers. Abstraction is harder to care about.View image in fullscreenFar more propulsive … Eve Myles as Jacqui Hames and Robert Carlyle as Dave Cook.Photograph: ITV StudiosOn top of that, the script is deeply lacklustre. It is repetitive (there is barely a character that doesn’t tell Nick he looks tired and he twice apologises to Rusbridger “for making your life difficult”). It simply has bad lines (“We’re in a firefight here! They’re going to keep slinging mud until something sticks”) and bad ideas (such as the recurring dung beetle trundling across the screen to remind us of the aphorism about eating lots of faeces before you can fly).Also, it has a suffocating reverence for its subject that frequently borders on risible. Davies is a saint whose violent childhood has given him “a deep-seated urge to hit back against anyone who takes power and abuses it” and whose ex-wife still tells the children they have “an impressive dad” while making them watch and read everything he does. Rusbridger is full of cringe-makingly heroic lines (“My life? This is bigger than me”), and the air of smug righteousness that suffuses the drama (apparently unironically, for those who are about to write in saying there could be no better commentary on the leftwing media) is deeply unendearing.Between the sprawl and the tone, much is lost. What remains feels oddly quaint. So many worse instances of police corruption, abuses of political and institutional power, the erosion of personal and collective privacy and other rights have emerged since the world was convulsed by social media that the damage News International did seems to sit in a different landscape. The Hack almost transforms into a period piece about – God help us – simpler, happier times.The Hack aired on ITV1 and is on ITVX now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDavid TennantToby JonesPhone hackingNational newspapersNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesreviewsShareReuse this content"

It wasn’t that Porter was angling for another collaboration. On the contrary: “I felt it was unadaptable because of it being a kind of weather system in Shy’s head. Also, I was a bit worried about all my content being wrung out for adaptations.”By the end, I was knitting bootees for one of the young actors who’d just become a dadFast-forward two years and Shy was out in the world. Murphy, meanwhile, had set up his own film company, Big Things, and was “trying to dream up a project” to follow its award-winning debut, Small Things Like These, about abusive church workhouses for unwed mothers in Ireland. “Myself and Max talk all the time,” he says. Both have sons. Murphy comes from a family of teachers, while Porter has a sideline teaching in prisons and spent part of lockdown mentoring boys excluded from school. They decided that they would like to do something about care. “Not anything particularly about masculinity at that stage,” says Porter, “but something to do with the care system.”View image in fullscreen‘I wondered what I’d got myself into’... Tracey Ullman and Murphy in Steve.Photograph: Robert Viglasky/Netflix/PAThere was just one problem. “While I adore Shy as a piece of literature,” says Murphy, “I recognised that it was unadaptable.” In the background of the novel, though, was the shadowy figure of the headteacher, Steve, a benign but minor presence. “Then,” Porter picks up, “I said, ‘How about we do Steve and I just leave the book behind?’ I started again completely.”The result is a virtuosic piece of expressionistic storytelling set in a last-chance remand school in the 1990s, where overworked and underpaid staff struggle to nurture boys written off by society. It is simultaneously a cry of rage about a dysfunctional system, cut beyond the bone by a previous era of axe-wielding Tories, and a demonstration of why teenagers like Shy are worth saving, despite their often monstrous behaviour. Shy, for example, has trashed a shop, crashed an Escort, stabbed a finger (his stepdad’s) and broken a nose (we don’t find out whose).Porter wrote the screenplay himself – his first – with a starring role for Murphy as the embattled headteacher presiding over a rabble of boys. There was a trio of women: a fierce but motherly deputy head, a student counsellor and a timid new staff member. Before long, Tracey Ullman, Emily Watson and Simbiatu Ajikawo – AKA Little Simz – had signed up.Casting the pupils was a bigger job. “We saw 3,500 kids,” says Murphy. One stood out for Shy. Jay Lycurgo was born in 1998, two years after the film takes place. In the mid-90s, his dad played for Manchester United, but had since switched to work in pupil referral. “I got the email saying I had the audition,” says Lycurgo, “and I was like, ‘Dad, can I come and see you?’ I went to his office and ended up going to schools for a few weeks.”I’m interviewing them all in a rabbit’s warren of hotel rooms the morning after the red-carpet London premiere of Steve. It has been a whirlwind few days, with well-received premieres also in Toronto and Cork. “A drama suffused with gonzo energy and the death-metal chaos of emotional pain,”wrote Peter Bradshaw in this paper, “cut with slashes of bizarre black humour.”Variety’s Peter Debruge enthused: “A profoundly moving and superbly acted diamond in the rough.”View image in fullscreenHoliday reading … Murphy and Max Porter.Photograph: Mat Hayward/The Hollywood Reporter/Getty ImagesPorter, Murphy and director Tim Mielants sit in separate rooms, looking washed out. Ullman is stuck in bed upstairs with a croaky voice, but Lycurgo and Ajikawo are in the same room, fizzing with energy and banter. They are delighted to discover that they were both rejects of the Brit school of performing arts. Ajikawo admits that she didn’t even get an audition, while Lycurgo recalls turning up with a tear-jerking audition speech he had done for GCSE and forgetting the first line. “I didn’t get in because I thought acting was crying,” he says.The film takes place over a single day and was shot in sequence over 29 days with a two-week rehearsal period beforehand for the boys to get to know each other. Mielants, who is Belgian and talks in metaphors, was still working on post-production for Small Things Like These when he was presented with the script. It could hardly have been more different, he says. Whereas Small Things had “a very small top-of-the-iceberg dialogue over a lot of silences, Max wrote a script that built a cathedral of words on top of the iceberg. So it’s like, ‘Wow. How am I going to do this?’”It helped that he had been suffering a midlife crisis, he adds, caused by his father’s Alzheimer’s and the death of his brother, which had sent him back to family videos from the 1990s. “I wanted to see my parents, my grandparents again. And I understood the value in seeing them talking to camera.” This experience informed the film’s grainy, handheld aesthetic, and the idea of getting every resident of the house to do an interview direct to camera, describing themselves in three words. While the boys are boisterous, Steve is tearful and lost for words. “I’m looking at him instead of trying to understand him,” says Mielants. “And that’s where the surrealness comes back.”The film is partly a love letter to the clashing musical cultures of the 1990s. “Max was sending me all these playlists,” says Mielants. “So I was story-boarding while listening to drum’n’bass, which wasn’t my kind of music. Then I started seeing stuff upside down, which was more like getting inside the minds of Steve and the boys. I was 16 in 1996 when that music was around. And I remember the energy and all these chemicals going through your body. I felt that the visuals should represent that feeling.”The idea of filming in sequence over a short period came from Murphy, inspired by working with Ken Loach on The Wind that Shakes the Barley. Normally before taking a role, he says: “I lock myself away for months, reading and just walking around, talking to myself and developing a physicality and a voice. For this one, because I grew up in a house with teachers as parents, and I was a relatively troublesome kid at school – not in a malicious way but just annoying – I felt I had it to draw on. And because we were shooting chronologically, and Steve is so behind the curve with everything – underfunded, lacking in sleep, with a boy who is deteriorating – I wanted to be behind the curve all the time, stumbling over words and trying desperately to hold everything together. I didn’t want to be super-prepped.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s a love letter’ ... Jay Lycurgo, left, and Simbiatu Ajikawo AKA Little Simz.Photograph: Robert Viglasky/Netflix/PAThe unspoken subtext to the film is the differences – and similarities – between the mid-1990s and today. While dictaphones, Sony Walkmans and rackety old Renault 5s might seem quaint, underfunding of the care system and the vilification of young men are only too familiar. “Hopefully what it highlights is that the problems that these kids have are for ever,” says Murphy. “They existed pre-technology and pre-internet and pre-social media. They’ve just been exacerbated by the development of this stuff.”Teenage boys, it seems, are all too easy to write off. “I think they’re an easy target, statistically and ideologically. And certainly in Ireland and in the UK the suicide rate among young men is staggeringly and tragically high,” he adds. For all that, in person, Lycurgo seems nothing like the tempestuous Shy, he knows all too well what Murphy is talking about. “I deal with mental health every day in my own personal struggles,” he says.At school, Lycurgo was cheeky and distracted, more interested in football than studying. It wasn’t until he was 19 that he discovered he had dyslexia and could have done with the sort of personal attention he saw in his father’s referral units. His breakthrough as Shy was to realise he could use that vulnerability. “I felt like it was a piece of me that I just had to show to everyone. So it’s not necessarily like, ‘I’ve got this character.’ It’s like, ‘OK, cool. How can I use it to respect Shy and to respect the material?’”By the time Ullman and Ajikawo arrived on set, the actors playing the boys had boisterously bonded. “They were so feral and hostile I wondered what I’d got myself into,” says Ullman. “But as a grandmother, I get that boy energy, and their vulnerability. I began to enjoy it. By the end, I was knitting bootees for one of them who had just become a dad.”Shy by Max Porter review – lyrical study of troubled youthRead moreAjikawo had the added pressure of balancing rehearsals with the run-up to an appearance alongside Coldplay on Glastonbury’s Pyramid stage, which was booked for the weekend filming wrapped. While in person, she is stylish and articulate, in the film she is a dowdy mouse. “I missed the workshops,” she says, “which I think was kind of cool and true to where I fit into the story – because I’m new to the school.”In her other persona, as Little Simz, she wrote a song for the film. “I wanted it to feel like a 90s banger, as well as having moments of tenderness,” she says. “But also, Shy loves jungle, so let’s get some great beats in there.” The track is called Don’t Leave Too Soon. Looking at rough-cuts of the film, she realised, at heart, it was a race to save Shy from himself. She looks warmly at the actor who brought the story to life and tells him: “In the song, I was saying, ‘You want to be seen and I see you.’ It’s a love letter to you.” Which is a pretty good summary of the film.Steve is in cinemas now and on Netflix from 3 OctoberExplore more on these topicsFilmCillian MurphyMax PorterMenMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Attention all swans! You are not safe! Immigrants from inferior cultures have been seen loitering with intent to kill in royal parks. They want to eat you alive. Be very vigilant. All offenders who are caught will be punishable under sharia law.”Never say that a half-hour phone in withNigel Farageon Nick Ferrari’s LBC morning show is anything but educational. Listen and learn. It’s an object lesson in how to perfect the 30-minute hate. Soon to become compulsory if Reform win the next election.That’s the trouble with modern Britain. We just don’t hate well enough. We have to learn to hate better. Trust no one. And above all, assume that every foreigner is just a sex offender in waiting. Understand that and you will be welcome in Nige’s Britain.The first call came from Marie. An American with three kids who had lived in the UK for 25 years. She used to work, had paid her taxes but now worked voluntarily as a school governor. She was here under indefinite leave to remain (ILR). Would she be deported? Nige didn’t reply. Instead, he went on about the 1.3 million people who were here under ILR and were just out to milk the benefits system for £230bn. Ferrari pointed out that this figure was contested. But Nige was unbothered. It was the principle at stake. Who cared if any of this was accurate? Keep focused. This was all about the hate.Marie observed that he hadn’t answered the question. Would she be deported? Nige umm-ed and ahh-ed. On balance, he reckoned she probably would be. He knew it was harsh. She wasn’t the sort of person he primarily had in mind to get rid of, but there would have to be collateral damage. Fair’s fair. He was fed up with foreigners clogging up our motorways. If you’re stuck in a traffic jam it will be an illegal immigrant who caused it.“You might be better off at home,” he said to Marie. Home USA. But she could take her kids if she liked. Bye, bye Marie. Thanks but no thanks. Your time is up. And close the door of the school where you work behind you. Next?Then came a pharmacist. Would Farage endorse Donald Trump’s advice for pregnant women to not take paracetamol. Not a problem for Nige. Farage often says he lives rent-free in British politicians’ heads, but Trump lives rent-free in Nige’s. He is The Donald’s emissary to the UK. An existence dedicated to sanitising Trump’s madness for a British audience. So Nige hedged his bets. He wouldn’t necessarily follow the Trump line on tylenol, as it is known in the US. But there again he wouldn’t trust the World Health Organization or any medical professionals either.What you had to remember was that there was no such thing as science. The real world was one of relativism. Anything could be true or it could be a lie. And the thing that had been true one day could be untrue the next. And vice versa. So the safest thing was not to believe in anything. Trust no one.Nige wasn’t about to tell anyone what medicines to take. Overdose on fentanyl if you feel like it. It’s only the scientists who are saying it will kill you. And yet Nige had also forgotten that at his own Reform conference a doctor had said it was highly likely the royals had got cancer from Covid jabs. Should have trusted the anti-vaxxers. Trust no one, except cranks, conspiracy theorists and The Donald.By now we were deep into the unsettling Maga alternative universe. Nige wouldn’t condemn Trump for saying that Sadiq Khan was introducing sharia law to London because that’s not what he had said. Even though he had said it. Here was the thing. You weren’t supposed to take anything Trump said literally. But you were meant to take it seriously.Hmm. How does this work exactly? Not long ago he was telling Vladimir Putin that Ukraine would have to concede territory. Now he’s saying the opposite. Which bit are we meant to take seriously? And what about that war between Armenia and Azerbaijan?Rather than take him seriously and try to second guess the meaning, wouldn’t it be safer to assume The Donald was making it up as he went along? It might be scary but it’s more helpful. Endless flattery makes no difference.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nige knew it was Sadiq’s plan for London because he had been told about it by a taxi driver from Buckingham. So it must be true. Taxi drivers know everything. And by the way, Trump was also right that Europe is going to hell. Our swans and carp were under threat from filthy foreigners. Just as cats and dogs were being eaten by Haitians in the US. Nige dared Ferrari to prove him wrong. It’s amazing that so many people still want to visit London. Unpaid parking fines punishable by being stoned to death.On to Israel and Gaza. Nige had a cunning plan to create a Palestinian state in a piece of desert near the Dead Sea where no one was currently living because it was totally uninhabitable. But that would do for the Palestinians, and somewhere would be better than nowhere. They could build the odd canal if they liked. And with a bit of luck it might end up like Palm Springs. Why hadn’t anyone thought of this before, we all wondered. Blessed are the peacemakers.By now we were racing to the end. Nige did reckon that America might be going a little far in stamping out free speech from critics of the Republican party. Very big of him. He seemed to have forgotten that he had banned some journalists from his own conference. Easily done.Then a final one on his home in Clacton. Everything was legit and that was an end to it. He had nothing more to say except through lawyers. All we wanted to know was if he had lent his partner the cash. But that was too much.Then Nige was off. To spend more time with taxi drivers. How else was he going to find out about sharia law. And then to patrol the ponds in the royal parks. Those swans weren’t going to take care of themselves.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageThe politics sketchReform UKRadionewsShareReuse this content"

McSweeney identified Starmer as the most plausible candidate to defeat Corbynism – after the defeat of Jeremy Corbyn in 2019 – and crafted a platform.But there is more to their partnership than expediency. Starmer has tried out other chiefs of staff over the years but none have suited him like McSweeney. His second chief of staff,Sam White, was a bad fit. His third, Sue Gray,tried to marginaliseMcSweeney and made enemies in the process, ultimately leading toher own exit.Starmer has until recently implicitly trusted McSweeney’s strategic advice. There were whispers about his position after Starmer seemed to question that strategy in government in an interview with his biographer,Tom Baldwin. Starmer then made a dramatic show of defending his chief of staff to the whole cabinet, saying unequivocally that he believed they all owed their positions to the soft-spoken Irishman.But unhappiness with the party’s rock-bottom poll ratings and a series of unforced errors means many of McSweeney’s internal critics are now sensing their chance to force a change of direction.MPs blame McSweeney for the bruising battle over welfare and the hangover in government from the damaging missteps that Starmer made in his early handling of Israel’s assault on Gaza and a subsequent ceasefire vote.And it is clear some of the classic McSweeney tactics have not worked in government. Giving no quarter to internal critics was disastrous in the run-up to the welfare vote, when even some of McSweeney’s closest friends and former colleagues went unheeded as they were sounding the alarm that the government was headed for defeat.He has also borne the brunt of the criticism for the calamitous handling of the eventualsacking of Peter Mandelsonas US ambassador. The pair have long been close and there is deep suspicion that McSweeney equivocated when it came to Mandelson’s departure over deeply embarrassing emails to Jeffrey Epstein. That is fiercely denied by No 10 sources but many MPs believe McSweeney should never have pushed through the coveted appointment for his mentor in the first place.That fiasco was swiftly followed by theresignation of Paul Ovenden, his closest ally in Downing Street, over texts about Diane Abbott.But this latest story to dominate the front pages – the undeclared donations toLabourTogether – has the potential to be the most destructive because it concerns the very way that McSweeney and Starmer forged their relationship when the latter was mulling a leadership bid.If there are more damaging donations revelations to come, that will taint Starmer as well and the threat of a leadership challenge could grow.Emails between McSweeney and Labour’s head of legal reveal the lawyer’s concerns about the donations. Gerald Shamash said there was “no easy way to explain how LT finds itself in this situation”.Donors giving to Labour Together may well have been nervy given the vicious factionalism in Labour at the time. The organisation was also trying not to attract too much attention as a vehicle for a post-Corbyn leadership battle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But they went broadly unnoticed, because they were not logged on time.The Electoral Commission had decided Labour Together was a members’ organisation and thus needed to declare its donations. Since 2015, it has shape-shifted many times. It has been an internal Labour caucus, a thinktank, an incubator of talent and a leadership vehicle. Key figures have come and gone – once, its big names were Jon Cruddas, Lucy Powell and Lisa Nandy, many of whom are now out of favour.It currently operates as a kind of arms-length policy brainstorming space intended to sketch out bold thinking on ideas such as ID cards and devolution, where young wonks can spitball about “project chainsaw” and plot their own paths to becoming MPs.As a political force, it has seemed a little directionless with Labour in government. Itsmost recent director, Jonathan Ashworth, who lost his seat in July, quit after less than a year in post.What it is mainly good at is raising money and funnelling it towards the party’s favourite sons and daughters. It was a major player in the 2024 election – and it gave almost £900,000 towards election campaigning, making donations towards the general election campaigns of 106 MPs. Only seven of those MPs had held their seats prior to the election. Its former director Josh Simons is now a minister in the Cabinet Office.Should Labour Together be found to have committed more serious breaches under McSweeney, then the ripple affect may go much further than Starmer’s beleaguered chief of staff. MPs will find themselves taking questions from opponents about why that money was accepted when the carelessness of the body’s reporting has been known for many years.There is potential for the scandal to spiral, even as No 10 says there is nothing to see and that the penalty has already been paid.The Conservatives and the rightwing press spot their biggest target yet. No one knows what Starmer would look like without his right-hand man, and his departure would remove the prime minister’s last remaining human shield.Explore more on these topicsLabourMorgan McSweeneyKeir StarmerThinktanksanalysisShareReuse this content"

I know people are proud of their area, which is why they are so desperate to look after what they love and to get rid of the boarded-up shops, shuttered youth clubs and crumbling parks that have become symbols of a system that stopped listening.“That’s why we’re not handing down promises from Westminster. People have the answers to the problems in their communities and now they’ll have the tools to fix it. More power to restore pride in where they live – and on their terms.”Starmer heads to Liverpool this weekend for what is likely to be one of his toughest party conferences as Labour leader. With the party 10 points below Reform and close to its lowest ever poll rating, the prime minister is under more pressure than ever to show his strategy for government is bearing fruit.Andy Burnham, the man who would be kingRead moreThe pressure increased on Wednesday when the New Statesmanpublished an interviewwith Burnham in which he said the Labour party faced an “existential” threat and that the country needed “wholesale” change.“Am I ready to work with anybody who wants to sort of put in place a plan to turn the country around? I’m happy to play any role,” Burnham said, in comments that were widely interpreted as expressing an interest in the Labour leadership. “I am ready to play any role in that, yes. Because the threat we’re facing is increasingly an existential one.”On Wednesday eveningthe Telegraph published an interviewwith Burnham in which he said MPs had privately urged him to challenge Starmer for the party leadership.“People have contacted me throughout the summer – yeah. I’m not going to say to you that that hasn’t happened, but as I say, it’s more a decision for those people than it is for me.”Thursday’s announcement forms one part of a multi-day fightback by Starmer during which he also intends to give a speech about the threat of populism on Friday, before giving his conference speech on the theme of “reclaiming patriotism”.Under the regeneration plan that the prime minister will announce on Thursday, 330 deprived areas will receive tens of millions of pounds over a decade to be spent on renewal schemes. Officials say many of those areas will be in coastal communities, former coalfields and market towns – the kinds of places that voted heavily for Brexit and where Reform is performing strongly.They described them as “places that fell through the cracks of previous regeneration schemes”, with many of them having lost libraries, youth centres, pubs and post offices in recent years. The scheme has echoes of the previous government’s levelling up agenda, which was a plan championed by the former prime minister Boris Johnson as a way of reducing Britain’s yawning regional inequalities.Unlikethe levelling up funds, local authorities will be given the freedom to decide where the money will be spent, as well as extra powers to help them regenerate their high streets. Experts warn, however, that the money will need to be allocated and spent quickly to make a difference on either an economic or political level.Jack Shaw, the director of the thinktank Groundwork Research, said: “[This] announcement makes clear that investment in the public realm and high streets is back as a political priority – and on a bigger scale than under the Conservatives.Keir Starmer to launch progressive fightback against ‘decline and division’ fuelled by far rightRead more“But history tells us funding like this has been too slow to reach communities. If ministers want to deliver real change, they’ll need to move quickly and get spades in the ground without delay.”Alongside the money, local authorities will also be given extra power to take over derelict buildings and block certain businesses from setting themselves up on the high street. The government is planning to bring new legislation to allow local authorities to block bookmakers and other gambling businesses, vape shops and barbers that are deemed to be “fake”.The proposals are part of a wider devolution drive being spearheaded by the new communities secretary, Steve Reed. The Guardianrevealed this weekthat Reed was keen to give mayors more powers, with ministers exploring the possibility of handing over power on some health and education services to mayoral authorities.Downing Street believes Labour’s best hope of winning the next election is to show that there have been tangible improvements to people’s daily lives and local communities, if only small ones.Officials liken the strategy to the “broken windows” theory of policing pioneered by the New York police chief William Bratton in the 1990s, which prioritised dealing with low-level vandalism and antisocial behaviour as a way to foster local pride and help stop more significant crime.“It’s about demonstrating progress is possible,” said one No 10 official. “You can’t be progressive if people no longer believe in the idea of progress.”Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerReform UKPovertyCommunitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Some cases were adjourned, while others were moved online or transferred to different venues.One respondent in South Shields, South Tyneside, said: “The court had to close early for two days within the last 12 months or so. This was because dead and rotting seagulls were within the roof insulation. The court had to close because maggots were literally raining down on to the lobby.”More everyday problems included inadequate air conditioning, dilapidated toilets and poor technology, ranging from poor quality remote hearings to software problems and a lack of working plug sockets.The Law Society president, Richard Atkinson, said: “The poor state of court buildings across England andWalesis both a contributor to the huge backlog of court cases and an illustration of the woeful lack of investment in our justice system. Government underfunding is denying us, our children and our businesses a vital public service.“The backlog in our crown courts stands at more than 76,957 cases, while two-thirds of care cases in family courts take longer than the 26-week time limit. There are currently 35,475 open family court cases, according to recent statistics.“Behind each of these statistics are tens of thousands of adults and children who could be freed from limbo and move forward with their lives if they could have their day in court.”The survey found the same proportion of solicitors considered the physical state of the court fit for purpose only “to some extent” (55%) or “to a large extent” (17%) as inthe last poll in 2022.One in five of almost 300 respondents in the latest survey, which was published on Thursday, said the technology in the courts was “not at all” fit for purpose.The Law Society said problems in the courts could deny clients access to justice – with many at risk of losing jobs and facing insecure housing situations – as well as wasting time and money.Solicitors with a disability were significantly more likely to find the physical state of the courts “not at all fit” for purpose (45%) compared with those without (25%). This was owing to limited accessibility in court buildings, such as an absence of ramps and working lifts.Issues withreinforced autoclaved aerated concrete(Raac), associated with crumbling schools and other buildings, were highlighted at courts in Doncaster, Preston and Harrow.A judicial office holder at Doncaster crown court said: “The magistrates court has Raac in the ceiling. Nobody has sought to fix it so the magistrates court has decamped to one half of the crown court (the other half occupied by the coroner’s court). If I am not in the one available court with a dock, I am operating in an office room being used as a courtroom with a kitchen as my retiring room.”Atkinson said more must be done to address the £1.3bn courts’ maintenance backlog.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “This government inherited a justice system in crisis but is working flat out to ensure our courts and tribunals are safe, secure and equipped with the latest technology.“We have already boosted capital funding to £148.5m and carried out around one million maintenance visits this year to make our buildings become fit for everyone who uses them.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandCourts in crisisWalesUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

After Corbyn stepped down after losing the 2019 general election, McSweeney ran Starmer’s campaign to become Labour leader.Keir Starmer’s relationship with his chief of staff faces biggest test yetRead moreCompanies House records state that McSweeney remained director of Labour Together until April 2020, when Starmer won the leadership contest. At that point McSweeney became a senior aide to Starmer, first in opposition and then in government.Kevin Hollinrake, the chair of the Conservative party, said McSweeney’s role in Starmer’s campaign should have been declared as a donation from Labour Together in the parliamentary register, as he called for an investigation. “Donations or support in kind to MPs from members’ associations must be declared – yet ‘nothing to see here Keir’ completely failed to do so,” Hollinrake said.But Labour said McSweeney’s salary was paid by Starmer’s campaign for the duration that he worked for it, and therefore his participation did not need to be declared as a donation.A Labour source said: “Morgan’s salary was paid for by Keir’s leadership campaign for the duration of the campaign, not Labour Together. Neither Keir nor his leadership campaign accepted monetary or in-kind donations from Labour Together during the leadership election.”Hollinrake wrote to the Electoral Commission last week demanding a fresh investigation into Labour Together’s declarations while McSweeney was running it.The watchdog fined Labour Together £14,250 over its handling of almost £740,000 in donations in 2021. The group blamed an “admin error” for its late declarations, which were only made after McSweeney’s departure from the organisation.Last week, theConservativesreleased a leaked email from the Labour lawyer Gerald Shamash in which he advised Labour Together “to be seen as transparent as possible” in the matter. He wrote that there was “no easy way to explain how Labour Together finds itself in this situation”, and that “if Labour Together cannot deal substantively with questions I pose then perhaps [it is] simply best to base our case as to the non-reporting down as admin error”.This was in response to McSweeney’s apparent claim that he had been told by the Electoral Commission early in 2018 that Labour Together did not need to declare its donations. But Shamash warned that neither the commission nor Labour Together had any record of such a conversation.The Tories have claimed that Labour Together used a “false excuse” of administrative errors.The Electoral Commission has not reopened its investigation but is understood to be assessing whether any of the information published in recent days materially changes its original assessment, with the aim of arriving at a conclusion by the end of this week.Explore more on these topicsMorgan McSweeneyLabourThinktanksConservativesKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

Such a move would be a serious blow to any two-state solution.But Macron said that any attempt to annex the West Bank “would be the end ofthe Abraham accords, which was one of the success stories from Trump’s first administration. The United Arab Emirates were very clear on it.”He added: “I think it is a red line for the USA.”Macron’s comments provided the clearest insight yet on the behind-the-scenes diplomacy on plans for a “day after” theGazaconflict.The signing of the 2020 Abraham accords, which normalised relations betweenIsraeland a group of Arab states including the UAE, is prized by Trump as one of the crowning diplomatic achievements of his first term in office.If Trump does indeed insist that annexation must not happen, Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, will be put in serious political difficulty, as parts of his extreme-right governmental coalition have demanded that Israel seize the West Bank either partly or completely.View image in fullscreenMacron said he had appealed to Trump directly, telling him: ‘You have a major role to play and you want to see peace in the world.’Photograph: Ludovic Marin/AFP/Getty ImagesOn the other hand, if Netanyahu went ahead with annexation – with US endorsement or quiescence – the plan for a two-state solution in which a Palestinian state sits alongside Israel would be in serious jeopardy. Netanyahu is due to meet Trump at the White House on Monday and will address the UN general assembly on Friday.Macron said the initial goal in his “brand new” multi-stage plan was to secure a ceasefire and the release of all the hostages.He said he had appealed directly to Trump at their meeting, saying: “You have a major role to play and you want to see peace in the world.”He said: “We have to convince the Americans to put pressure on Israel” as the US is “the country with real leverage”.Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff also said the US president had presented regional Arab and Muslim leaders with a 21-point plan for peace in the Middle East at a meeting on Tuesday. Speaking at an event on the sidelines of the UN general assembly, he said: “We’re hopeful – and I might say even confident – that in the coming days we’ll be able to announce some sort of breakthrough.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The goal was to demilitarise and break up the militant group, he said.But he suggested that some rightwing members of the Israeli cabinet were more intent on spoiling any political settlement. “The objective of some is not to fightHamasbut rather to undermine the possibility of a path to peace,” he said. He added: “There is no Hamas in the West Bank.”He stressed that Netanyahu’s strategy of total war was a failure since it only endangered the hostages and has failed to reduce the size of the Hamas military. “There are just as many Hamas fighters as before. Total war from a practical point of view is not working. This war is a failure.”Macron said the fate of hostages and Gaza’s civilian population should not be “left in the hands of those for whom the release of hostages is not a priority”. He added: “Netanyahu’s first priority is not the release of hostages – otherwise he would not have launched the latest offensive on Gaza City, nor would he havestruck negotiators in Qatar.”He insisted that as part of the plan for the future governance of Gaza and the West Bank, Hamas would be removed and a Palestinian Authority with new commitments to reform would eventually take charge. He gave no timescale.He warned if there was a failure to bring an end to the fighting in the coming days, Europe would have to consider what other steps it would take; asked if that meant sanctions, he replied: “Obviously.”Asked if there was ever going to be a majority for sanctions in theEuropean Union, he said he was trying to change that, adding each country had its own history and sensitivity – a reference to Germany, which along with Italy has resisted sanctions.Arguing that Palestinians had to be offered a political perspective for their future, Macron said the core of his argument was that “if you don’t give a group of people a political way out for their own legitimate existence when the international community recognised that 78 years ago, you are going to lead them to a complete loss of hope – or even worse violence.”Explore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesIsraelEmmanuel MacronGazaDonald TrumpHamasBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

One victim died at the scene. The suspect is deceased.”Department of Homeland Security officials previously said two detainees were killed, but later issued a corrected statement saying that the shooting killed only one detainee. It adds that two other detainees were shot and are in critical condition.“The shooter fired indiscriminately at the Ice building, including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot. Three detainees were shot,” the department said.One of the detainees in critical condition is a Mexican national, Mexico’s foreign ministry confirmed in astatement.

They said they were not releasing the identities of any of the victims at this time, but confirmed that no members of law enforcement were injured during the attack.Trump wrote onsocial mediathat had been been briefed on the shooting, calling it “despicable” that the shell casings contained anti-Ice messaging. He immediately cast blame for the shooting on “radical left Democrats”, instructing them, in capital letters, to “stop this rhetoric against Ice”.“The continuing violence from Radical Left Terrorists, in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk’s assassination, must be stopped,” Trump wrote. “ICE Officers, and other Brave Members of Law Enforcement, are under grave threat.

The hospital spokesperson did not have any details about their conditions.Earlier on Wednesday,Kristi Noem, the DHS secretary,confirmedin a statement that the suspected shooter died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound and said details about the incident were “still emerging”, but confirmed that there were “multiple injuries and fatalities” at the Ice field office.“While we don’t know motive yet, we know that our Ice law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them,” Noem said. “It must stop.”Law enforcement officials toldCNNthat at least two of the victims were Ice detainees.Todd Lyons, the acting Ice director, told the network that the “scene is secure” and said three people were shot and taken to the hospital.1:04‘My mom thought it was fireworks’: witnesses recount Dallas Ice facility shooting – videoAn Ice spokesperson has also toldNBC Newsthat all three people shot were detainees.Dan Bongino, the deputy director of the FBI,saidthe agency was “fully engaged, in conjunction with our state and federal law enforcement partners, at the crime scene in Dallas”.JD Vance called the shooting an “obsessive attack on law enforcement” that “must stop”.“I’m praying for everyone hurt in this attack and for their families,” the vice-presidentwrote on X.Vance alleged the suspect was a “left-wing extremist”, which has not been corroborated by law enforcement. A motive was still unknown as of Wednesday afternoon.“There’s some evidence that we have that’s not yet public, but we know this person was politically motivated,” Vance said, without providing or describing the evidence. “They were politically motivated to go after law enforcement.”John Cornyn, another Republican senator who represents Texas, called the shooting“horrific”.“While law enforcement investigates, I am keeping everyone impacted in my prayers,” he said. “My staff have been in touch with federal & local officials inDallas, and we will make sure all resources are brought to bear in the investigation.”Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, said in astatementthat “Texas fully supports Ice”.“This assassination will NOT slow our arrest, detention, & deportation of illegal immigrants,” he said. “We will work with ICE & the Dallas Police Dept. to get to the bottom of the assassin’s motive.”During the news conference, Eric Johnson, the mayor of Dallas, urged residents to “be patient, remain calm, and let our law enforcement partners, and our police department, do their job”.Explore more on these topicsIce (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US crimeKristi NoemTrump administrationUS immigrationUS politicsDallasnewsShareReuse this content"

We’re here for pandemic preparedness, for the vaccine programmes, and to help protect British patients over the winter.”Ricks said the UK’s rigorous pricing regime, under which it pays less for medicines than other developed countries, meant it would miss out on new drugs if it did not increase prices and scrap a contentious rebate scheme, known as VPAG, the voluntary scheme for branded medicines’ pricing, access and growth. VPAG negotiations over drug pricing between government and the industry broke down last month, and the government has yet to formally restart talks.Hughes said Moderna was in a different position, as vaccines do not come under the VPAG scheme. “The uptake of innovative vaccines is very, very good across the NHS, and the payment of those is done through central contracts.”Moderna’s new centre at the Harwell science campus, which hosts more than 250 organisations across health, technology and energy, will produce mRNA jabs for the NHS’s seasonal vaccination programmes. It has been granted a licence to make Covid jabs and will also apply for a licence to make flu vaccines.Beyond respiratory diseases, the Moderna site will be researching how to use mRNA science in areas such as cancer, rare diseases and immune disorders. It employs 80 people in manufacturing as well as 60 scientists and lab technicians at the clinical research and development facility. The latter will also analyse samples from Moderna’s clinical trials globally.The Moderna site can produce up to 100m mRNA vaccine doses a year, which could be ramped up to 250m in the event of a pandemic.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Messenger RNA trains the body to recognise and destroy harmful cells.Moderna’s chief executive, Stéphane Bancel, said its new centre marked “the first facility in the UK to manufacture an onshore supply of mRNA vaccines”.He added: “Our strategic partnership with the UK has already delivered more than 20 clinical trials across 110 sites nationwide, making Moderna the largest commercial sponsor of trials in the country.” He said the centre, which was built in less than two years, “underscores the UK’s commitment to improving health security, both against global health emergencies and ongoing seasonal respiratory threats”.Moderna’s opening was attended by the science minister, Patrick Vallance, who said last week that the government wasdetermined to resolve the standoffwith industry. He acknowledged that the UK’s spending on new medicines needed to rise from 9% of overall NHS spend.Vallance said on Thursday: “The pioneering work Moderna will be doing, here in the UK, on mRNA is a prime example of the opportunity we want to grasp.”This week the US drugmaker Bristol Myers Squibb said it would sell its new schizophrenia treatment in the UK for the same price as in the US, the first time it has done this. Cobenfy will have a list price of $22,500 (£16,553) a year.

While there is still time to act, the window of opportunity is finite and shrinking.”View image in fullscreenMark Carney arguedin 2015that there was still time to act, but the window of opportunity was shrinking.Photograph: Canadian Press/ShutterstockTen years on, the environmental groupsGreenpeaceand WWF and the thinktanks the New Economics Foundation and Positive Money are among the signatories to a new briefing, calling on the Bank to take more decisive action. They urge Threadneedle Street to commission a review of monetary policy, given the increasing frequency of climate-related shocks that can push up food prices, for example.Some economists have argued that central banks should be prepared to tolerate temporarily higher inflation, and even that governments should consider building up buffer stocks of staple foods to cushion the impact of price spikes caused by droughts or floods, which are becoming more common.The briefing warns that by raising interest rates to respond to such price rises, the Bank increases the cost of the huge public investment needed to transition away from fossil fuels.“The UK just experienced its worst inflationary crisis in four decades, triggered by fossil fuel price spikes and supply chain bottlenecks, which the UK’s monetary policy approach proved ill-equipped to address,” it says.A Bank spokesperson said: “Whilst the government is responsible for climate policy, climate risk threatening our objectives is part of the Bank’s remits, and we work to take action accordingly.”The Bank’s most recent monetary policy report, published as itcut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 4%, acknowledged the upside risk to inflation if “extreme weather events due to climate change were to negatively impact food production”.The campaigners are also calling on the Bank to ensure that climate risks are reflected in capital requirements for banks – the rules that determine what assets they must hold. And they would like to see the Bank discount fossil fuel-related assets when these are offered as collateral in its lending operations. The European Central Bank recentlysaid it would take account of “climate-change related uncertainties”in valuing the assets it accepts in exchange for loans.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On one side the progressive view where change came through democracy, the other driven by populists including Trump wanting a return to an older, more conservative worldview.View image in fullscreenBarack Obama who is on a European speaking tour was interviewed by historian David Olusoga at the O2 Arena.Photograph: PR IMAGEHe said: “My successor has not been particularly shy about it. That desire is to go back to a very particular way of thinking about America, where ‘we, the people’, is just some people, not all people. And where there are some pretty clear hierarchies in terms of status and who ranks where.”Obama was also critical of progressives who he said became “complacent” and “smug” in the 90s and 00s, “posturing that we believe in all these values because they were never tested. Now they’re being tested”.The former president has generally kept a low profile after leaving office. But he has made increasingly frequent interventions as the political landscape in the US becomes more violent, restive and divided along partisan lines.In London, Obama did not refer to Trump by name, only as “my successor”.The evening started with Olusoga welcoming the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, who had been criticised by Trump on Tuesday during his speech at the UN in New York.Khan had respondedby saying Trump had “shown he is racist, he is sexist, he is misogynistic and he’s Islamophobic”.Obama is in London as part of a European speaking tour, which includes another date in Dublin on Friday.

But do his arguments stand up?Rajeev SyalandFiona HarveyWed 24 Sep 2025 13.44 EDTFirst published on Wed 24 Sep 2025 13.23 EDTShareDonald Trump used a 55-minute incendiary speech to the UN on Tuesday to attack London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, the state of the city and the UK’s record on oil production and climate change.Trump’s UN rant revealed his true priorities – and Britain should watch out | Martin KettleRead moreCritics said the US president was using his international platform to spread racist lies and environmental myths about the UK for political gain.We have examined his claims to see if any stand up to scrutiny.London ‘to go to sharia law’Trump said: “I look at London, where you have a terrible mayor, terrible, terrible mayor, and it’s been changed, it’s been so changed. Now they want to go to sharia law. But you are in a different country, you can’t do that.”There is no evidence that Khan, a member of the “soft left” of the Labour party who defines himself as a liberal and progressive, wishes to introduce any form of sharia law in London.Sharia, Islam’s legal system, is derived from the Qur’an and the sayings of the prophet Muhammad. The term “sharia law” is generally applied to countries such as Saudi Arabia and Taliban-run Afghanistan and is associated with harsh criminal punishments and strict codes of conduct, particularly for women. Interpretations, however, vary.Sharia councils, also known as sharia courts, have existed in pockets of the UK, including London, since the 1980s. They serve in an advisory role, dealing with personal and religious issues within Muslim communities,according to the House of Commons’ library. Labour and Conservative governments have been clear that their rulings are not legally binding.Rightwing memes have long claimed that Khan plans to introduce sharia law. In 2020, photos with a quote attributed to Khan read: “We are trialling shakira [sic] law in three of London’s boroughs right now. We will then roll it out in the remaining thirty next year.”The post, which misspelt it as “shakira”, was falsely attributed to Khan, the mayor’s office said.Trump’s comments claiming that London has been changed for the worse under a “terrible” mayor echoed remarks six days ago that “crime in London is through the roof”. The most recent statistics from the mayor’sofficeshow an annual fall in theft, robbery and burglary.Tension between the two men dates back to 2015, when Khan condemned Trump’s call to ban all Muslims from travelling to the US. The US leader also attacked Khan’s handling of the London Bridge terror attack in 2017.During the US leader’s first state visit in 2019, Khan permitted the flight of a giant inflatable “Trump baby” blimp.UK has lost ‘powerful edge’ on North SeaTrump claimed the UK had given up its “powerful edge” by making North Sea oil “so highly taxed that no developer, no oil company can go there”.He said: “They have tremendous oil left and, more importantly, they have tremendous oil that hasn’t even been found yet.Squeezing every last drop of oil and gas from the North Sea wouldeke out the basin’s reserves for about 14 years, according to theNorth Sea Transition Authority, at current extraction levels.Far from having vast reserves unfound, the regulatorprojects that 90% of future production will come from existing fields.When Russia invaded Ukraine, oil and gas prices soared, giving companies bumper profits while they incurred no extra costs. The Conservative government slapped a windfall tax on those profits,backed by the International Energy Agency. Critics said the tax was too low and Labour has since increased it.Trump rails against taxes, but the Norwegian government put its profits from North Sea oil into a sovereign wealth fund.That fund – which did not inhibit Norway’s drilling – isnow worth $1.8tn and generates more income for Norwegian citizens than oil and gas production.Green policies ‘ruining’ the countrysideTrump also attacked the UK’s green energy policies, saying: “I want to stop seeing them ruining that beautiful Scottish and English countryside with windmills and massive solar panels that go seven miles by seven miles, taking away farmland.”Trump need not fret –solar farms take up far less room than golf courses in the UK. Sheep graze happily among solar panels and windfarms and research has shownfarmers can even expect higher yieldsthanks to reduced heat stress and conserved moisture.The world could bepowered with solar panelscovering a fraction of the Sahara desert,according to one estimate.Scotland had 15GW of onshore wind capacity in 2024, but development was stalled for nearly a decade in England after David Cameron’s Conservatives imposed a de facto ban in 2015, since lifted by Labour. As a result, in 2022 the UKbuilt fewer onshore wind turbines than wartorn Ukraine.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUnited NationsSadiq KhanLondonKeir StarmerRenewable energyEnergyexplainersShareReuse this content"

What forgiveness?’: Syria’s deadly reckoningAndrew Rothin New YorkWed 24 Sep 2025 15.31 EDTLast modified on Wed 24 Sep 2025 21.31 EDTShareNot too long ago,Ahmed al-Sharaa– better known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani – would have been arrested on arrival in the US. The former head of Syria’s al-Nusra Front hada $10m bountyon his head for organising “multiple terrorist attacks throughout Syria, often targeting civilians”.This week, however, aftertoppling the dictator Bashar al-Assadin a lightning offensive last December, he is being feted in New York as he meets with world leaders in the first visit to theUnited Nationsgeneral assembly by a Syrian head of state since 1967.“For long years we suffered injustice and deprivation and oppression,” said Sharaa, dressed in a grey tailored suit and burgundy tie, in his address. “Then we rose in claiming our dignity.”He faces a daunting task at this week’s United Nations general assembly: to cut the figure of a statesman who can assuage concerns about his past, quell fears over thesectarian violence, and navigate tricky regional diplomacy with the United States andIsrael– while also maintaining the hardline reputation at home that carried him to power.Fact-check: Donald Trump’s false and misleading claims during his UN addressRead moreThe former militant’s arrival has led to surreal scenes in Turtle Bay. On Tuesday evening, one of the hottest tickets in the city was at an ornate private members’ club in midtown Manhattan filled with businesspeople, diplomats and journalists, where Sharaa opined on his journey from jihadist to statesman in a “fireside chat” for the Middle East Institute.His responses to skepticism about his transformation are practised: critics should not judge his past, which included membership in al-Qaida, without the context he lived in. “Anyone watching a child being killed in the streets will revolt,” he said at one point according to a live translation of his remarks in Arabic. “The pressure led people to seek solutions within the scope of the means available to them.”A day earlier, he was sitting down with David Petraeus, the former CIA director and ex-US army general who headed multinational forces in Iraq while Sharaa was fighting and imprisoned there alongside other members of al-Qaida.“It is good that at one time we were in combat, and now we are in dialogue,” Sharaa said, smiling to his former enemy. “Someone who went through war is one who knows best the importance of peace.”Privately, Trump administration officials recognise that the US has no backup plan to Sharaa’s leadership in Syria, and that he is the best chance to prevent Syria’s return to civil war. While pushing him to calibrate his remarks about Israel and to crack down on acts ofsectarian and retributive violenceat home, there are also concerns of estranging him from his base and local power circles.“He is jumping through the hoops to show that he can be a world leader, not just a fighter,” said one US official who has met with Sharaa. “All of this is very carefully calibrated … So far, he is pulling it off.”At one point, Petraeus turned almost tenderly to the former leader of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, which was only delisted as a foreign terrorist organisation in July, and asked him a “more personal question”.“How are you holding up under all this pressure? Are you getting time to do some thinking? Are you getting enough sleep at night? I have been there and it is so very, very hard, and your many fans – and I am one of them – we have worries.” The room at the Concordia centre burst into applause.In his public appearances, Sharaa has said there is a chance for a peace deal with Israel, but he has also said thatSyriais “scared” of Israel’s foreign policy in the region – and balked at the idea that Syria would join the Abraham accords normalising relations with Israel, pointing to anger at home over Israeli airstrikes on Syria and over the war in Gaza.Another of Sharaa’s key goals while inNew Yorkthis week is to lobby for the US to drop sanctions on Syria. While Donald Trump terminated some sanctions in June, the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019 would require congressional repeal, which might not be immediately forthcoming.Before walking into a meeting with Marco Rubio, Sharaa responded to a question about lifting the sanctions by shrugging toward the US secretary of state, as though to say: it’s not up to me, it’s up to him.“The Syrian people should not be killed another time through the sanctions,” Sharaa said this week. “The Syrian people love work. Lift the sanctions, and don’t worry about them.”Explore more on these topicsUnited NationsSyriaNew YorkMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

But he’s always there. In the Oval Office meeting where Ye pledged his fealty to Donald Trump, at his infamous “white lives matter” Paris fashion show, at any of his messianic “Sunday Service” worship sessions – there he is, impassive, camera trained on Ye.In Whose Name? review – Kanye’s descent makes for grimly compelling watchRead moreThat kid is Nico Ballesteros, who DM-ed his way into Ye’s orbit as a teenager in 2016, volunteering to record events Ye held at his Calabasas compound. By day, Ballesteros was a student at Orange County School of the Arts; by night, he was quickly becoming a staple of Ye’s entourage. “I would be in class texting with them and they’d be like: ‘Oh, I’m with Ye right now. We’re in Malibu, at Rick Rubin’s,’” Ballesteros, now 26, recalled recently. “And I’d be in class thinking: ‘Why am I even here? I’ve got to be there.’” By senior year, Ballesteros had assimilated into Ye’s scene. Which is how he got the assignment, shortly after Ye’s hospitalization for mental distress in 2018, to film constantly for what Ye pitched as all-access, no-holds barred account of his bipolar disorder post-breakdown (or as the openly unmedicated Ye proclaimed it, his “breakthrough”.)Over the next six years, Ballesteros filmed over 3,000 hours of footage of Ye as the superstar experienced creative breakthroughs and, more often, outbursts, meltdowns, paranoia and international opprobrium. The resulting film,In Whose Name– given limited release this month after a torturous edit – is a grimly fascinating portrait of an exceptionally gifted mega-celebrity in unmitigated crisis, a fly-on-the-wall view of personal and professional downfall.In Whose Name offers an inverse view to the many shocking clips of Ye since 2018 – the Oval Office visit, the Chicago homecoming, the strange alliance with evangelical leader Joel Osteen, all filmed from within Ye’s orbit, with direct access to the delusions of grandeur and megalomaniacal thinking behind them. The film, aiming for a wider release after asolid box office haulwith almost no marketing, spans a particularly tumultuous and isolating time in Ye’s life: his failed, Maga-adjacent presidential campaign; calling slavery a “choice” in a much-denounced 2018 TMZ interview; his divorce from, and harassment of, ex Kim Kardashian; theend of his lucrative partnership with Adidas, among other business deals, after severalantisemitic tweets, including: “I’m a Nazi … I love Hitler.”It’s all, one would imagine, a lot for a teenager to process, let alone film ethically, but Ballesteros takes questions in stride. He maintains that Ye, who openly decries medication, understood the stakes of filming; in an early scene, taped during Ballesteros’s second week on the job in 2018, Ye tells the prolific producer Pharrell Williams his intent to document his mental health. “The invitation was apparent to me,” said Ballesteros. At the beginning, he says, Ye “was in such a clear state of mind. He made it so apparent that that’s what this was for. My silence and my stillness and my observation and bearing witness to it, I feel, was the best service that I could provide to him.”In Whose Name follows in the mold of verité documentaries – no talking heads, no narration, an unvarnished single timeline, albeit an unfathomably busy and starry one. Ballesteros’s memories of filming are a blur, as he followed Ye’s sleeping schedule of three to four hours a night. One section from 2018 sees Ballesteros, along with Ye, travelling to the White House, Uganda, Los Angeles, Big Sur, Chicago and Basel, Switzerland, in the span of a week. It was often a struggle to stay awake. “All I was thinking was, I know we have this thing where I’m supposed to always record,” he recalled of nearly falling asleep in the Oval Office. “That’s what we feel is the mission here. I just have to sustain the shot.”During the whirlwind, Ballesteros silently witnesses Ye’s rage toward his wife and her family, Kardashian’s tears as Ye continues to publicly align with Donald Trump. “I would rather be dead than on medication!” he screams at Kris Jenner in one scene I found difficult to finish. (Of the Kardashians, Ballesteros said “they’ve always been so respectful to me … they obviously knew what I was there to do and they were appreciative of it,” though he’s vague on whether they’ve have had any conversations about a documentary that seems to challenge the tightly controlled image of their media empire. “For the most part, there are certain people who I’ve intersected with organically, and reconnected with across the film as a whole, and some I haven’t,” he said. “I’ll just leave it at that.”)He witnesses, too, Ye’s insistence, in meetings with shocked executives and artistic directors, that he’s the greatest artist of all time, a Picasso, a visionary for “not being a slave to these companies”. He serves as a mostly silent fourth wall for Ye’s assertions of purpose; in a scene that stretches the meaning of surreal, Ye, unnervingly done up in cat-like prosthetics, insists to the camera that he is “mentally free”, because being bipolar means that everything is an art piece.View image in fullscreenNico Ballesteros with Ye during Paris fashion week in October 2022.Photograph: AMSI EntertainmentOne might wonder if there was ever a point – say, when a fuming, clearly disturbed Ye gets in Kardashian’s face – that the camera should stop. But Ballesteros insists on the inherent neutrality of the project. “Even though I was young, I understood what it meant, more or less, to be a journalist. And I knew interjecting was not my responsibility or my role, and that I would then be crossing a line,” he says. (Ye treated him well, he said – “he was always so respectful of whenever I needed to take a beat to just rest,” though he “didn’t like when I stopped recording, because I think he just wanted to feel seen, ultimately.”)Even in Ye’s most shocking moments – and there are plenty, as he insists on invoking slavery bereft of any historical accuracy – “I always just maintained journalistic integrity,” he said. “I knew that that was the professional thing to do, to keep my own personal opinions out of it. Because if I were to start to have opinions and formulate points of view, it would create a bias. And I didn’t want to change what I initially intended, which was to create an objective observational documentary.” He maintains that Ye had no input on the final product, though the two watched a cut together, an experience Ballesteros hasdescribedas “beautiful”.Arguably the most fascinating observation is not Ye’s grim descent into rightwing nihilism, but how everyone around him barely reacts. Ballesteros films Ye in what seems to be constant contact with the uber-rich, powerful and provocative: Elon Musk, Jacques Herzog, Donald Trump, Drake, Charlie Kirk, Candace Owens – all of them overly obsequious, none of them challenging his ego, save Swizz Beatz and a clearly heartbroken Michael Che, post 2018 SNL meltdown. (Chris Rock assures Ye that his off-script rant defending his Maga hat will go down like Sinéad O’Connor ripping up a photo of the pope.) Everywhere he goes, cameras, eager face, devotion, fascination – “a reality distortion field” of fame. The film’s name, with its religious overtones, provokes questions of our continued attention and loyalty, in the face of madness.But though In Whose Name is, in part, “a film about idolatry”, Ballesteros said his ultimate aim was compassion. “A lot of those things that may have occurred throughout all those headlines … wasn’t the deepest part of who this human is,” he said.“Perhaps there’s some empathy there,” he added. “It’s not necessarily a goal of mine to convince anyone of anything, but I wanted to create a study of the human, not the idol.”In Whose Name is out in US cinemas now with a release elsewhere to comeExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsKanye WestKim KardashianfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Details are not final, but should the agreement go through as has been reported, the owners of the US’s most powerful cable TV channels may soon also steer the nation’s most influential social network. The arrangement would gift Trump’s billionaire allies a degree of control over US media that would be vast and unprecedented.Here’s what we know. Under the known terms of the deal, which Trump declared has the tentative buy-in of Chinese presidentXi Jinping, TikTok in the US would get a new group of US investors, led by the US software giant Oracle, which would license TikTok’s vaunted recommendation algorithm and take over its security.Among the other investors, Trump said in a Fox News interview on Sunday, are media mogulRupert Murdochand his son Lachlan, the CEO of Fox Corporation. Trump said Michael Dell, the CEO of the computer maker Dell, would also be involved.TikTok would get a new seven-member board of directors, six of them Americans. It is a distinct possibility that Rupert Murdoch,Lachlan Murdoch, Oracle’s Larry Ellison and David Ellison, CEO of Paramount Skydance and Larry’s son, will occupy some of those seats.The MurdochsLachlan Murdoch, the 54-year-old son of 94-year-old Rupert, is executive chair and chief executive officer of Fox Corporation, the parent company of Fox News. The Murdoch scion took control of the company following a legal settlement in September with his siblings, one of whom, James, reportedly no longer wants anything to do with his father’s conservative empire. The deal for TikTok will likely involve Fox’s parent company investing, rather than Rupert or Lachlan individually,CNNreported.“I hate to tell you this – a man named Lachlan is involved. You know who Lachlan is? That’s a very unusual name, Lachlan Murdoch,” Trump said. “Rupert is probably gonna be in the group, I think they’re gonna be in the group, a couple of others. Really great people. Very prominent people. And they’re also American patriots, they love this country, so I think they’re gonna do a really good job.”Asserting supervision of TikTok would offer the elder Murdoch a mulligan for his abortive ambitions in tech. News Corp purchased Myspace in 2005 for a whopping $580m. Three years later, it peaked, becoming the most-visited site in the US. However, the insurgent social network Facebook soon dethroned it, and Mark Zuckerberg’s net worth today amounts to 10 times that of Rupert Murdoch’s, per Bloomberg’s billionaires index.The EllisonsTrump seems to have a fondness for father-son pairs. At the other end of TikTok’s American boardroom may sit Larry and David Ellison, 81 and 42, the founders ofOracleand Skydance Media, respectively.The elder Ellison is the co-founder and chief technology officer of Oracle, an enterprise software and cloud-computing company worth nearly $900bn. Ellison himself, who holds roughly 40% of Oracle’s shares, briefly dethronedElon Muskas the richest person in the world after the company reported superlative earnings earlier this month. He’s a longtime Silicon Valley fixture and Trump donor who hosted a fundraiser for the president at his southern California estate in 2020. He’s known for a jet-setting lifestyle of multiple mega-yachts and the deed to almost all of the Hawaiian island of Lanai.The younger Ellison’s company has become an entertainment industry vacuum, sucking up Paramount – which operates CBS, BET, Nickelodeon, Paramount+ and the UK’s Channel 5 and which produces the Mission: Impossible franchise – in August. Hot off the heels of its corporate consummation, Paramount Skydance is now reportedly preparing amajority-cash offer to take over Warner Bros Discovery, owner of CNN, HBO, DC Comics, the Discovery Channel, HGTV and the Food Network, to name a few.In the months leading up to the merger, CBS News made a series of Trump-friendly moves like settling a lawsuit against 60 Minutes, appointing a Trump ally as an ombudsman and courting “anti-woke” former New York Times columnistBari Weissas a potential leader of a changed version of the channel. The moves may serve as a roadmap for how David Ellison would helm TikTok.How powerful would they become?The power centralized in the Murdoch and Ellison families would be enormous should theTikTokdeal and David Ellison’s purchase of Warner Bros Discovery go through. They would command media outlets that reach both young and old audiences, with high degrees of authority and influence. The only age groups perhaps immune to their sway would be gen X, so suspicious of their parents’ viewing habits, and millennials, just too old for TikTok.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Federal Communications Commission’s website is blunt in its anti-monopoly rules when it comes to broadcast television: “FCC rules effectively prohibit a merger between any two of the big four broadcast television networks: ABC, CBS, Fox [Broadcasting Company], and NBC.” The regulation does not pertain toFox NewsChannel or CNN, as they require paid subscriptions to view.Still, the rule is instructive. What if the owners of the US’s most powerful cable channels also steer the nation’s most important social network? Would that violate monopoly laws?The answer may lie in a rule change the commission made eight years ago when it eliminated a prohibition on owning both a broadcast station and a daily newspaper in the same region. The reason: “the growth in the number and variety of sources of entertainment, news and information in the modern media marketplace”.If a person can have a town’s TV station and its newspaper, why can’t a billionaire take control of a social network used by hundreds of millions and the president’s favorite channel?Parsing the letter of the FCC’s rules likely does not matter as much as the current currency of high-level US government decisions: Trump’s favor. The president’s takeover of the FCC has already been incredibly successful, establishing a fiat over deals that allows him to pressure networks not under his allies’ control. The supreme court ruled earlier this week that Trump’s firing of the lone Democrat on the commission could stand. Though hedenies it, head commissioner Brendan Carr seemed to play a leading role in Disney’s brief suspension of Jimmy Kimmel from ABC’s airwaves withthreats against the network.The landscape of American media is looking very red as Trump’s TikTok deal takes shape. The largest owner of local TV stations in the US, Nexstar, declared fealty to Trump with its decision to no longer air Kimmel’s show, as did local TV titan Sinclair. Now two of the nation’s marquee news networks, CBS and CNN, may follow Fox’s rightwing lead. Online, X has turned from a heterogenous feed into aconservative social network. TikTok may go the same way under its Maga-approved board.At the moment, the Murdochs and the Ellisons must be savoring Trump’s favor.Explore more on these topicsUS newsRupert MurdochTikTokDonald TrumpOracleLachlan MurdochFox NewsanalysisShareReuse this content"

In Joe Orton’s 1964 treacle-dark comedy, greed and desire form a nasty compact.Sloane – no first name – is sizing up Kath’s spare room. Jordan Stephens (of hip-hop duo Rizzle Kicks) gives the mysterious stranger a bold, open smile, and Tamzin Outhwaite’s Kath blinks like a moth to flame. “You have the air of lost wealth,” she breathes, running what she insists is a motherly leg up his calf. She’s soon straddling him on the chaise (“I shall be so ashamed in the morning”), and when brother Ed arrives it’s clear Sloane will similarly wriggle like an eel into his affections.Orton’s first full-length play announced a distinctive voice: highly polished speech and murky behaviour. Orton, who cut a swathe through the public conveniences of north London, knew that sex was the body’s unbeatable trump card. His dialogue is a tightrope of propriety quivering above the lewd, every step an innuendo.Set designer Peter McKintosh’s in-the-round stage is a neat circle of chintz lapped by filth. Above hangs a collage of coal-black domestic objects (pram, cot, birdcage), a happy family home blown apart.

The drama was one of themany Black Mirror-adjacent dystopiasof that time, shown at the same festival asThe Assessment(what if the right to have children was decided by someone else) and Daniela Forever (what if a lucid dream trial could reunite you with a dead partner). The year before had seen The Pod Generation (what if babies could be grown in artificial wombs),Foe(what if a body double could take your place) andFingernails(what if true love had to be scientifically proven) and given the mostly subpar quality of them, we had started to dream of our own radical future, a land where these copycats ceased to exist.One Battle After Another review – Paul Thomas Anderson’s thrillingly helter-skelter counterculture caperRead moreAfter a lowkey festival debut, overshadowed by splashier fare, the film was picked up by Apple, neatly fitting into the platform’s tech-tinged fare (as well as the aforementioned Fingernails, the streamer also hasSwan Songaka what if a clone could live your life after death). To its credit, All of You is one of the least egregious of an increasingly egregious subgenre, a surprise given its heritage. It’s directed and co-written by William Bridges, whose credits include not only Black Mirror (he wrote Shut Up and Dance and co-wrote both USS Callisters) but the instantly forgettable rip-off seriesSoulmates, a one season dud that did the “what if” but for a genetic love test. Bridges created that show with Ted Lasso breakout Brett Goldstein and the pair remain convinced of their concept, reusing it here, even down to the name of the company involved (Soul Connex). It makes the film a sort of strange spin-off, a continuation after a cancelled second season, fan service for fans who don’t seem to exist.Not that it’s a hard film to understand otherwise, a simple setup – what if a test could match you with your soulmate – serving as the jump-off for a rather conventional relationship drama. We start with college friends Laura (Imogen Poots) and Simon (Goldstein himself) as he takes her to get the test. He’s unconvinced by the idea but she’s determined, and the film then flashes forward to selected moments over the next few years; Laura finds her soulmate, Simon realises he has feelings for her, they drift apart and back together, other people came and go.It reminded me of a Drake Doremus movie, for better and worse. He broke out with 2011’sLike Crazy, a genuinely wrenching drama about the awfully relatable pain of a long-distance relationship, but has struggled to recapture that intensity since. His films tend to star attractive actors, cooly dealing with love and sex and the messiness in-between and often, like inEqualsandZoe, he also brings in a sci-fi element (what if emotions were treated as a disease and what if compatibility was scientifically testable, respectively). While never as consuming as Like Crazy, there’s a similarly effective structure here, a way to concisely involve us in the incremental toll of loving someone you can’t quite find a way to be with. Each time we leap forward, we have to get our bearings – who’s with who, is this a happy period or a sad one – and we start to understand the grind of it that more easily, the film paced so that we never get too far into a moment we’ve already got enough from.The sci-fi gimmick is surprisingly well-used, in smart and sparing ways. The initial burst of Soul Connex commercials across London feel eerily of-the-moment, given the influx of ads for both AI and Ozempic that we’re now flooded with, and while it does lead to some briefly knotty dinner party debate, it’s mostly just a heightened replacement for something many of us already know, a reason not to be with someone. In the film, Laura can’t be with Simon because she’s married to her soulmate, and while here that might be a proven scientific fact, she’s as smugly convinced as someone would be without that surety.But like with the lesser Doremus films, All of You can also struggle to transport us to the heady highs and weepy lows its characters are feeling. Poots almost gets us there, a naturally charming performer who is both funny in her (slightly underbaked) banter with Goldstein and crushing when the weight of her decisions start to break her (one day she will make for a top-tier rom-com lead). But an unsure and underpowered Goldstein isn’t quite up to the challenge, easily overshadowed by her more nuanced and experienced work, and it leaves an imbalance in our investment, not helped by the film choosing to stick in a lower gear for too long (one argument, where the pair spar over not showing, ahem, all of themselves to the other, is not quite cutting enough). It’s a calm, crisply made film (one can again see how it matches the Apple aesthetic) but one about heartache and tumult, and I found myself craving something that felt as difficult and stinging as the feelings it was trying to stir up.All of You is out on Apple TV+ on 26 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsRomance filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsApple TV+Drama filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Will a ‘forcing party’ help me stop procrastinating?Planning a time to do things we’re putting off in the presence of others makes them more pleasant – and less difficultElle HuntWed 24 Sep 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 24 Sep 2025 12.02 EDTShareMy friend Amelia and I are in many ways alike: we’re both freelance journalists, with a sweet tooth and a Simpsons quote for every occasion. And we’ve both got tasks we’re putting off.Amelia’s are tedious household jobs: ordering new vacuum filters, investigating her broken dishwasher, measuring a panel of her bath for some reason.Mine are all work-related: edits on one piece, pitching another. At the top – or bottom – of my list is sending a difficult email to an interviewee, marked “to-do” since last November.And so, one sunny Thursday morning, we gathered at Amelia’s kitchen table to hold a “forcing party”.It’s perhaps even less fun than it sounds. The concept was coined by an X user called Tyler Alterman, whotweetedsemi-jokingly about wanting to hire someone to force him to complete tasks he was procrastinating from.When one of Alterman’s friends responded with an offer of help,they agreedto throw a “force-one-another-to-do-stuff party”. Altermanlater reportedthe results: a completed passport application, a brand new website and a cleared inbox.Inspired, Amelia and I allocated one hour to complete all the tasks we’re procrastinating from, and vowed to hold each other to account. At first the vibe was stoic as we tapped at our laptops. I was still trying to avoid the email. Start with an easy win, I reasoned as I plugged through my edits.Amelia finished a task first. “I messaged the bank,” she said proudly. “That’s huge.”But the quiet kitchen didn’t match our celebratory mood. I opened a new browser tab, typed in “InstantRapAirhorn.com” and smashed the big red button.The sound functioned like a shot of adrenaline: we were instantly upright, transformed like Pavlov’s slavering dogs at the bell, newly attuned to all we might yet accomplish and the rewards in store.That email had never looked more possible. The party was kicking off.Ewa Lombard, a neuroscientist and senior researcher at the University of Geneva’s Lab for Uncertainty, Collective Intelligence and Decision-Making, says there are a few different reasons why a forcing party might work to overcome procrastination.The first is reward substitution: coupling a thankless task with something pleasant – in my case, hanging out with Amelia. Social interaction “is a very powerful reward for most people,” says Lombard.Tasks we’re inclined to put off are usually not “intrinsically motivating”, says Lombard: boring, unpleasant, difficult or with little perceived reward. “They do not excite your reward system, because you’re not curious about them, there’s no novelty attached – there’s only complexity.”View image in fullscreenNeuroscientist Ewa Lombard says that we often over-estimate how much time we need for a task or are put off by its apparent complexity.Photograph: Courtesy Ewa LombardThis is true of our tasks. Amelia is a curious person, driven by novelty, so it’s no surprise that she’s lax with household admin. My aversion to writing that email is emotional; I have to explain that the piece I interviewed him for isn’t going to be published, and I feel bad for wasting his time.The second motivating factor is the time constraint. Often, Lombard says, we over-estimate how much time we need for a task or are put off by its apparent complexity.For example, you might predict that making a website will take several days. “In reality, you might need three hours – but you don’t know that, because you don’t have that experience,” Lombard says.Blocking out an hour or two limits the unpleasant period, making it easier to start. The thought of being free afterwards further focuses us, Lombard says, because we anticipate the reward.The deadline also helps you to reach a productive state more quickly. A psychological principle called the Yerkes-Dodson law dictates that we become more effective with a certain amount of physiological or mental arousal, but experience diminishing returns beyond that, Lombard says.A time limit can spur us on to that optimal state, raising neuroadrenaline levels the same way fast-tempo electronic music might.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Alterman’s forcing party featured optional shots “for liquid courage”, and concluded witha round of applause. I tell Lombard about InstantRapAirhorn.com, and she nods like it makes perfect sense: “You added some reward conditioning.”While forcing parties might seem solely about productivity, the social aspect is key to their effectiveness. They share similarities with body doubling, or completing tasks in the presence of another person – a strategy used by people with ADHD.Focusmate, an online service, pairs strangers on video calls for this exact purpose.Another parallel is hackathons, which first took off in Silicon Valley; software engineers would meet to collaborate on a short, focused burst of intense work. The concept has since been adopted more widely as a way to brainstorm solutions, problem-solve or boost innovation.When Lombard interviewed hackathon participantsfor a 2023 paper, interviewees described the events as energising, “amazing”, even the best way to spend a weekend.“Part of the magic was the social novelty,” Lombard says. This increases levels of noradrenaline and dopamine in the brain, and thus motivation. Social proof – wanting to be accountable and do right by the collective – was another important factor: “You don’t want to let others down.”Many hackathon participants reported that the time pressure forced them to be more creative. With typically 24 hours, sometimes fewer, they did not “have the time to procrastinate”, Lombard says.More from Why am I like this:I’m an adult. Why do I regress under my parents’ roof?My friends made plans without me – is it weird to invite myself?Why do I feel like I’m stuck in a ‘waiting room’, hoping for my life to get started?I’m disagreeable – and it’s backed by science. Can I change my personality?Lombard and her colleagues also found an even more transcendent effect. Hackathons encouraged “kairos moments”: meaningful, rare and special instances that register as distinct from the daily humdrum and have lasting resonance.Just working in the presence of other people can reduce our own perception of the difficulty of a task, Lombard says. Plus: “Two brains are always better than one.”At my forcing party, I asked Amelia for help with checking a phrase and deciding how to prioritise my tasks. By the hour’s end, we had added the opening bars of DJ Khaled’s All I Do Is Win to the airhorn. The vibe was euphoric, and both our lists were nearly completed.Amelia liked the competitive element and the momentum generated by blitzing through tasks. She ordered her vacuum filters and measured her bath panel – the latter, she’d been putting off for “probably a year”.And yes, I sent the email. It took five minutes. My interviewee responded positively not long after. It shouldn’t have taken a forcing party to get it done – but I’m glad it did.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyWhy am I like this?featuresShareReuse this content"

Doubtless, some will have persuaded themselves that the real Trump was the onewe saw in Windsora week ago, fawning over the royals, treating Keir Starmer with respect, and claiming that Britain and the United States were two notes in the same chord. Well, maybe.Perhaps the more plausible version was actually the one whowent to the United Nationsthis week. This Trump went not to fawn but to boast and trash, whingeing about everything from the UN’s supposed failure to back his claims to have ended seven “un-endable” wars, to its refusal to award him a renovation building contract – “I said at the time that I would do it for $500m, rebuilding everything, it would be beautiful” – for its New York headquarters complex.Which one is the real Trump? There is probably no single version of the US president’s huge personality that makes complete sense of all the competing others. To be fair, Trump is not alone in this. Centuries ago, Michel de Montaigne wrote that none of us is ever one person alone; “every sort of contradiction can be found in me,” the French sage concluded. Never a truer word was written, especially as far as Trump is concerned.Another clue that may help unlock the puzzle is that Trump’s explosive mix of often contradictory qualities seems increasingly to resemble that of Otto von Bismarck. The founder of modern Germany is many people’s idea of a master politician – not something that many – except maybe Trump himself – would say about the president yet.Like Trump, however, Bismarck had the ability both to charm and brutalise, to calculate and to rage, to dominate the room, to never forgive his critics – and to lie shamelessly in pursuit of his goals. Bismarck was far more consequential in his career than Trump has yet been in his, but there are some disturbing parallels already, not least in the fateful instability of what Bismarck eventually left behind.It would be a mistake to read too much too soon into Trump’s unexpectedcomments about Ukraineon Tuesday. What he said was, all the same, a very striking U-turn for a man who thought his Alaska summit with Vladimir Putin could unlock a peace deal. Now, he has switched to backing the shooting down of Russian planes violating European airspace; dismissing Russia as a paper tiger not a real military power; and claiming that Ukraine could win back all of its lost territory since 2022. “Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act,” Trump posted later.Trump also promised “to supply weapons to Nato for Nato to do what they want with them”. That would also be very big, if true; the issue has bedevilled Nato’s negotiations with Washington for months. If Volodymyr Zelenskyy is also right that Trump is offering US postwar military guarantees to Ukraine, then this looks like something more substantial than mere hardening of the president’s language against Russia.There is a case for asking whetherthe UN speechmay have been something of a smokescreen, designed mainly for an isolationist US domestic audience. Meanwhile, off-camera, some potentially significant stuff was actually going on nearby over Gaza and Ukraine. Trump’s New York meetings with Zelenskyy and with Arab and Muslim world leaders suggest as much.Yet it would be foolish to dismiss the UN speech as a mere diversionary exercise or tactical ploy. It was more substantive and significant than that. Yes, there were the familiar lies and false claims on everything from the un-endable wars, through Sadiq Khan’s wish to introduce sharia law to London, to Trump’s own poll numbers. “The highest … I’ve ever had,” he asserted; in fact, his approval ratings are ata second-term low.And, yes, the narcissism and the language were at times outrageous. “I’m really good at this stuff. Your countries are going to hell,” he told nations that are supposedly still the US’s loyal allies – before denouncing “the green energy scam” and adding: “Trump was right about everything, and I don’t say that in a braggadocious way, but it’s true. I’ve been right about everything.” At 57 minutes, not the expected 15, it was a hard speech to listen to.Yet there was content in it too. There was also a clear argument. The White House had billed the speech as an exposition of how US power would be deployed on the world stage. The first part of the answer was predictable: not through the United Nations. So, as the tariff wars have shown, was the second: its power would be exercised unilaterally by a sovereign independent US. As theWhite House news releasesuccinctly put it: “At UN, President Trump champions sovereignty, rejects globalism.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Starmer’s invitation was a big mistake | Frances RyanRead moreTrump asked at one stage what the UN’s purpose was. His real quarrel, though, is with the international rules-based order itself, of which the UN forms merely one part. This stretches beyond the wider postwar settlement that the US shaped in the 1940s. In fact, as the speech made increasingly clear, Trump is more opposed to recent global regulatory accords and international law than he is to the post-1945 institutions that the US can dominate. This is why he hates the climate accords, and why he will always dislike the EU. It is also why he wants to export his ideas to Europe and Britain, and thus weaken the rules-based order’s principal champions.For Trump, the speech’s key issues are to end the threat to sovereign nations, as he sees it, from migration and the green agenda. These are not passing fancies. They are his enduring priorities, and they will remain so. This is likely to have continuing repercussions in the domestic politics of Europe, and perhaps, because the two countries insist so much on their special relationship, in British politics most of all. In the end, that’s why this speech matters.Nothing else can explain why Trump used the UN speech to attack Britain so insistently. Britain got it in the neck more than China, than Russia, than Venezuela or than North Korea. Trump attacked Britain relentlessly, sometimes seemingly more in sorrow than in anger, over migration, over international law, renewable energy, North Sea oil and on the recognition of Palestine. Less than a week after Trump’s state visit, the transatlantic chord sounds more dissonant now. It was as if Trump has looked at the world and at last found an unexpected adversary – us.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It was the second time I had defeated the government-backed candidate. The first was in 2019 when the mayoral electionswere annulledon flimsy pretexts; voters returned to the polls andhanded us a victoryby an even larger margin.But this year, democracy in Turkey has entered its most perilous phase. The process started in Marchon the eve of my nomination as the presidential candidate of the CHP, the century-old Republican People’s party. This was when my university degree wasabruptly annulled. Why is this relevant? Because, under the Turkish constitution, one must have a university degree to be able to run for president. Soon after, I was accused of corruption and “aiding a terrorist organisation”. For six months, I have been behind bars, arrested on politically motivatedcorruption chargesbased on“anonymous” witnesses. In a country bound by the European convention on human rights, this is an outrage.Nor am I alone. Across Turkey,more than a dozen mayorsfrom the oppositionare now imprisoned. Sadly, the numbers arerising all the time; more than a quarter of Istanbul’s districts have hadtheir elected leaders arrested,silencing millions of voters in one of the world’s great cities.From mayors inAdana and Antalya, to municipal staff in Istanbul, repression has reached every level. Hundreds of peoplelanguish in prison, including journalists, academics, businesspeople and students.Enes Hocaoğulları, a youth delegate to the Council of Europe,was detainedfor merely speaking out under Turkey’s vaguely worded lawson “misleading” the public. This shows how far the crackdown has gone. His release, after protests at home and abroad, is a small but telling victory for democratic resistance.I’ve never seen such clampdowns in Istanbul. Turkey’s democracy is fighting for its life | Orhan PamukRead moreLet me be clear about what is happening. In the arrogance of unchecked power, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is once more weaponising the courts against the democratic opposition. This time, opponents are being imprisoned and replaced with loyalists. Unable to shut down the CHP, the government is pursuing a case that will have the effect of erasing the CHP’s rising leadership by overturningthe outcomeof its 2023 national party congress. Earlier this month, a court moved to annul the CHP’s local congress in Istanbul,remove its chairand install a trustee.The case against the CHP, which the government keeps dragging out in hopes of destabilising the main opposition and removing its legitimate leadership, marks a turning point in the effective dismantling of political pluralism. A system where judges replace elected leaders with handpicked stand-ins is no democracy at all.Having hollowed out the republic’s institutions to build an authoritarian regime, Erdoğan now seeks to fabricate a compliant, hollow opposition. He intends to rewrite the rules so no genuine rival could survive, securing power in the style of Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak or Syria’s Assads. These are deliberate methods likely to be copied elsewhere tomorrow unless democrats everywhere stand together to resist them.Erdoğan’s increasingly repressive tacticsexpose his eroding popular supportand his desperatebid to preserve power. To avoid another defeat in the ballot box, he rewrites the rules. He relies on smear campaigns, corruption charges, efforts to divide the opposition and the ever-present “terrorist” label. Yet, this display of power has further undermined his legitimacy, leaving him increasingly dependent on a narrow minority and the machinery of the state.The people of Turkey are no longer deceived. Protests fill the streets, and polls consistently place CHP as the country’s leading party. Since 19 March, the day I was detained and jailed, millions of citizens, even in Erdoğan’s supposed strongholds, have been participating in peaceful protests to demand justice and change, despite the risk of arrest and police violence. This resistance reflects Turkey’s 150-year tradition of parliamentary democracy. But resistance alone is not enough.That is why the CHP is preparing a comprehensive roadmap for democratic transition, to build a resilient and inclusive alliance: win elections; stabilise the economy; restore judicial independence; combat corruption and organised crime; expand social rights; rebuild trust in institutions; and redefine Turkey’s role in a changing geopolitical landscape.Turkey’s fight for democracy, freedom and justice is not Turkey’s alone. If a nation whose experience proves that democracy is a universal project slides deeper into autocracy, the consequences will reverberate far beyond its borders.Yet I remain convinced: the will of the people will prevail. Our outrage in the face of injustices must be turned into a strategy. That strategy must involve building a new political culture and institutions that honour Turkey’s democratic legacy. If we achieve that, we will not only reclaim our democracy at home but help it rise again across the world.Ekrem Imamoğlu is the elected mayor of Istanbul and the presidential candidate for Turkey’s main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP)Explore more on these topicsTurkeyOpinionRecep Tayyip ErdoğanFreedom of speechProtestEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

It is not, admittedly, as hard as the problem of grappling with consciousness. But it is hard enough that the famous assurance by Glennon Doyle, lifestyle coach and thought leader, that “we can do hard things,” remains relevant. I am talking about the problem of how we talk about All the Way to the River,Elizabeth Gilbert’s new memoir – specifically, how to be kinder and more measured about it than the book really deserves.As you may know if you are one of the 30 million people who boughtEat Pray Love, one of the tens of millions who have read Big Magic or one of her other novels, or simply one of her 1.2 million followerson Instagram, Gilbert recently publisheda memoirthat tells the story of the final years of Rayya Elias, a 57-year-old hair stylist who died of cancer in 2018. This was the woman for whom Gilbert left her husband – the one she met in Bali at the end of the first memoir – and with whom she descended into a drug-addled nightmare after Elias’s diagnosis. It is a horrific tale, one in which Gilbert watches, sometimes helpless, sometimes enabling, as Elias spirals into paranoia and addiction and drags the boundary-less Gilbert down with her. It is also an awesomely, breathtakingly, jaw-droppingly bad book.Even the most successful authors can misfire, and All the Way to the River would be unremarkable if it weren’t for the fact that, to date, Gilbert’s instincts have always been so on the money. In terms of writing, she is vastly more talented than most operators in the female-empowerment space – the ones who tell us to be vulnerable, and the ones who advise us that the main thing is to have “grit” and the ones who assure us we can do hard things. Gilbert has never quite fitted into this crowd, partly because she has a writing career beyond grifty self-help, and partly because she has always seemed to me to be a much harder-nosed and more interesting figure than those gals.Big Magic, which counselled readers on how to have a creative life (and, by implication, how to become Liz Gilbert), is a perfectly wise book. Eat Pray Love is a pitch-perfect romcom. And while stylistically Gilbert can be as winsome as the next woman selling self-love, I’ve always been interested in the fact that she is about the only superstar creator of female inspo-content who doesn’t have children – not only that, but is matter-of-fact about never having wanted them. You have to tip your hat to Liz Gilbert, the woman is an absolute tank.View image in fullscreenElizabeth Gilbert and Rayya Elias at an event in New York in 2014.Photograph: Noam Galai/Getty ImagesI mention all this because All the Way to the River, which opens with a long, imagined address to Gilbert by the late Elias and includes a claim by Gilbert that she is channelling the spirit of Elias’s dead mother (“my soul left my body so Georgette could be alone with her girl”), has proved hard to review, mainly, I suspect, because the author has so much goodwill in the bank. The phrase “raw honesty” gets a lot of outings, as does “bravery”, the word you use for a book you hated but is about painful things you feel guilty about trashing. This newspaper called the memoir a “solipsistic mess”, but also, “moving”, while the New York Times called it “excruciating”, then quickly stood down and settled on the quieter critique, “earnest, vulnerable but ultimately quite corny”.For the author herself, the issue might have been one of what happens when you are your own source of material and that material starts to run thin. In the past, Gilbert has been quite honest about how calculating she is in her search for material. In her 20s, for example, she got a job at the grunge bar Coyote Ugly in downtown New York precisely so she could write about it. (The experience became a long magazinepiece in GQ, then a movie.) There’s nothing wrong with that, it’s what hacks do and she is better at it than anyone.This time, Gilbert seems to have gone a step further. When she met Rayya, Gilbert describes herself in the book as looking like a “sales clerk at Banana Republic”. Seven years after Rayya’s death and the author is pictured everywhere in a sleeveless jumpsuit, hair shaven, skin pierced and tattooed, a style she admits she picked up from her late girlfriend and that makes her many degrees better dressed than she used to be. But to this lesbian’s eyes it’s an odd piece of appropriation that on a latterly straight woman with a wardrobe from Banana Republic looks like someone who has shown up to Halloween in a lesbian costume.The tribute is, I’m sure, lovingly intended, but from the outside it looks like cosplay and seems to me at odds with Gilbert’s steely persona. On the other hand, the book went straight in at number two on the New York Times chart this month, so – and I mean this – not only good luck to her, but perhaps as usual, she knows precisely what she is doing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Second, any intervention should be aimed at firms that are more exposed because their relationship with JLR is indirect – the suppliers to the suppliers, as it were. Third, even in the latter case, there is a fair argument that ministers should try to strong-arm JLR into picking up the eventual bill. One aim, after all, is to ensure that JLR’s eventual return to production is as smooth as possible.The financial context is important. JLR is not an ailing corporate pauper in danger of ending up in a ditch itself. It is the main subsidiary of India’s Tata Motors andlast year made pre-tax profits of £2.5bn. Profits aren’t the same as ready cash for use in a crisis, butTata Motors’ first-quarter trading statement, issued on 8 August, a few weeks before the cyber-attack, showed JLR with a cash balance of £3.3bn. When combined with an undrawn revolving credit facility of £1.7bn, total liquidity was put at £5bn.By any stretch, that sum should be ample for JLR to support its direct suppliers, said to number about 700 companies. The largest will themselves have enough liquidity to wait until the crisis is over to make contractual claims to JLR for the interruption to their business. For those who need cash immediately, the onus is on JLR to find it, as the company recognises.The cyber-attack will probably end up costing JLR billions of pounds, just as the Covid pandemic did, but that is partly why capital buffers have to be large in this industry. Sudden crises are not unknown. Nor does JLR lack financial motivation to support its direct supply chain. It needs its restart of production – pushed back to 1 October, and probably only gradual initially – to run without snags.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The big danger is permanent damage to the component industry, which might show up first as interruption to production at other manufacturers who are served by the same base. The fragmented nature of the supply chain complicates matters. So does the just-in-time delivery model. So does the fact that the car industry across Europe is suffering from weak demand and overcapacity.But there is still a reasonable case for targeted intervention by government as a means of lessening the fallout risks in the supply chain. There is enough evidence already of workers being laid off temporarily and the whole industry slowing up.The idea, as reported by ITV, of the governmentbuying parts from suppliers to sell on to JLRwhen production restarts is, therefore, intriguing. The design sounds elaborate: being a go-between in an already complex supply chain is not straightforward. On the plus side, though, the government would own some actual assets, workers would be working and JLR (one trusts) would be on the hook to buy the parts when they are needed. Such an arrangement may indeed be preferable to a blanket distribution of loans, which, as the Covid experience showed, don’t always come back.But the government should also be clear with JLR that the company would be expected to assist a support exercise among the wider supply chain. The Treasury cannot be expected to underwrite the costs of cyber-attacks, which, unfortunately, have become a risk of doing business. JLR has the financial resources to help itself and pick up the full tab for supporting its direct suppliers. For assistance to the indirect supply base, there should also be an obligation to contribute.Explore more on these topicsJaguar Land RoverNils Pratley on financeAutomotive industryCybercrimeManufacturing sectornewsShareReuse this content"

I’ll spare you the details. But the insertion of this device wasn’t the stressful bit. Getting to the clinic, which was on the 26th floor, proved a far trickier procedure.The place was busy. I picked my way across the crowded lobby to find a queue for the lift, perhaps 10 metres long. Grumpily, I joined what I took to be the back of it. Who doesn’t resent queueing for a lift? I got a tap on my arm. This was a woman, calm but hostile, accusing me of pushing in. I protested my innocence, at which point she dropped the calm bit and fired up a bollocking of such ferocity that I just ran up the white flag and shuffled miserably to the back of the queue. By now it had doubled in length. Progress was slow.Our self-appointed head of enforcement was soon laying into another suspected queue jumper who, like me, thought better of taking her on. Pale and shaken, he sloped past me on his own walk of shame to the end of the line, which by now snaked around a corner out of sight. From there could be heard the sounds of similar arguments, even scuffles, breaking out. In the midst of all this, a very old woman marched slowly but determinedly past the lot of us. Scowling horribly, wielding her walking stick as if it might be re-purposed as a weapon, nobody dared stop her. Not a peep from anybody, even Ms Hostile. The tension was awful.An old friend of mine is a consultant at this hospital. “What a scrum this is!” I texted him. “Welcome to my world,” he replied.That day there was just the one lift out of order. I was told it’s often more. What is it about lifts? When they’re out of order, they seem to stay that way for ages. It’s like they’re punishing us for taking them for granted the rest of the time. At the BBC’s New Broadcasting House there are two lots of four lifts. At least one of them always seems to be on extended leave of absence. How about a hurrying up? What’s the hold-up? How rare can the spare parts be? You can get cars, boilers, bones, relationships fixed more quickly.We become more sensitive to movement, smell and manners as our world is reduced to a metal can and a random handful of fellow travellersI called a lift engineer I know, who said it’s all about the drive units. When they conk out, you’re waiting months for a new one, whoever you are – and that’s just the way it is. Too many people using too few lifts wears them out, he said. “The problem,” he explained gravely, “is that a lot of buildings are underlifted.” Not a word I’d heard before but this hospital was underlifted, make no mistake. After the 15-minute wait, I was grateful to finally edge my way on board.What’s the best way to apologise? I’m sorry, but I disagree with the newest suggestion | Adrian ChilesRead moreA lot goes on in lifts. Americans call them elevators, a neat if unintentional nod to how our senses are elevated once the lift doors close. We become more sensitive to movement, smell, manners and more besides as, for a few moments, our world is reduced to a metal can and a random handful of fellow travellers.There are two kinds of passenger: the regular user and the visitor. Each lift will have its experts, and its novices. The button-pressing of a regular will have a brisk – even brusque – certainty about it. If the lift is busy, the regulars, thinking ahead, will find a place to stand appropriate to the floor where they plan to alight. Novices, having given themselves away on entry, with their eyes darting about looking for the buttons, will do no such forward planning. Many a novice, their animal instinct primed for escape, will stand close to the doors. Here, they risk being caught in the stampede as those doors open at a popular floor. This disgorging can get ugly. Fancy footwork is required to dodge and weave out of the way. Often you must alight and let the seething mass pass.In the hospital lift you could spot the regulars - mainly staff - by the dead look in their eyes; they knew how long this was going to take. The rest of us, the novices, busied ourselves trying to reach the buttons. By now, I’d forgotten which floor I needed, so had to fish my phone out of my pocket to check. Tricky when you’re playing sardines; even trickier when you’re wedged up against a furious, scowling, stick-wielding old lady whose quiet rage hadn’t abated.There’s an occasional harrumph if it turns out someone has boarded only to travel one floorLift journeys are mini-dramas, with ever-changing dramatis personae. The script is sparse; silence generally reigns. Eye contact is rare. Passengers who know each other communicate in whispers, although you get the odd ones talking as if the rest of us need to hear them. There’s an occasional harrumph if it turns out someone has boarded only to travel one floor. Shameful. And then there are the muttered apologies of a new entrant who has committed the terrible sin of boarding late as the lift doors start closing, forcing them open again, holding us up. The loathing hangs heavy in the air.Elevator etiquette: seven deadly sinsRead moreThere are heartwarming acts of charity, too. The pressing of the Door Open button to admit a latecomer. Also, there’s saving a fellow passenger from alighting at the wrong floor. An example: bearing heavy suitcases I once called a lift to the first floor of a Berlin hotel. Down it came and, as I boarded, a man alighted, plainly thinking he had reached the ground floor. I advised him of his error, and he joined me back in the lift.This bloke, it turned out, was Pelé!But that’s another story.At the 26th floor of the hospital I took my bow and exited the stage, 20 minutes after texting my clinician to say I was entering the building. She wasn’t remotely surprised at how long it had taken me. She said for her it often made popping out to get some lunch and fresh air too much of a mission to undertake.There’s a serious point here. Out of the window, hundreds of London’s high rises littered the view. How many are underlifted? Or even unlifted? It’s a quality of life issue. Occasionally inconvenient, I’m sure, for the high finance folk toiling in the City of London’s monuments to Mammon. And doubtless worse for those, many with mobility issues, trying to live their lives in the countless tower blocks between here and the horizon.Adrian Chiles is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLife and styleOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

But Trump delivered a long and humiliating rant, filled with personal grievances andattacks on the UN, European leaders, migration policies and clean energy.Trump set a low bar with his often rambling and incoherentcampaign speeches, but it was still an embarrassing performance for the US president on the global stage. In his past appearances before the general assembly, Trump generally stuck to his prepared remarks and did not hector US allies sitting in the audience. But this was Trump unfiltered and unleashed – as he has been since the start of his second term, with no domestic or international restraint on his power and no need for even the mildest diplomatic niceties.Early in his speech, Trump complained that his teleprompter had malfunctioned and that a UN escalator had stalled when he and the first lady, Melania Trump, stepped on it on Tuesday morning. “These are the two things I got from the United Nations: a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter,” Trump joked, drawing laughs from the audience. But it quickly became clear that Trump was nursing a decades-old grudge against the UN: In the early 2000s, he had been denied anopportunity to rebuildthe organization’s New York headquarters.“Many years ago, a very successful real estate developer in New York, known as Donald J Trump, I bid on the renovation and rebuilding of this very United Nations complex,”Trump toldhis fellow world leaders – in a digression that would have been ridiculed if any other leader had done it. “I remember it so well. I said at the time that I would do it for $500m, rebuilding everything. It would be beautiful.” Trump went on to muse that he had promised UN officials marble floors and mahogany walls, while other contractors would ultimately deliver terrazzo and plastic, as part of amassive renovationthat ended up costing over $2bn.Even at the height of his power, Trump can’t resist being an insecure businessman who whines about losing a construction contract more than 20 years ago.And that wasn’t the most cringeworthy part of Trump’s performance at the UN. He went on several lengthy tirades against immigration, calling on European countries to emulate US policies and close their borders and expel migrants. He accused the UN of leading a “globalist migration agenda”, and told western leaders that the organization was “funding an assault on your countries”. As he lectured other leaders about how they’re failing, Trump bragged about his own immigration crackdown and foresight as a populist demagogue. “It’s time to end the failed experiment of open borders. You have to end it now … I’m really good at this stuff,”he said, adding nonchalantly: “Your countries are going to hell.”As part of his attack on migration, Trump also insulted Sadiq Khan, who was elected London’s mayor in 2016 and became the first Muslim leader of a western capital. “I look at London, where you have a terrible mayor, terrible, terrible mayor, and it’s been changed, it’s been so changed. Now they want to go to sharia law,”Trump said, falsely claiming that Khan wants to place the British capital under Islamic religious law.While Trump’s insult seemed ad-libbed, it’s another example of the president using his platform to settle petty political scores. Trump has held a grudge against Khan since late 2015, when Khan (then a member of parliament and candidate for mayor) called Trump’s campaign pledgeto ban Muslims from enteringthe US “divisive and outrageous”. The feud between the two politicians has continued for years. In an article for the Guardian published last week, shortly before Trump’s state visit to the UK,Khan wrotethe US president has “perhaps done the most to fan the flames of divisive, far-right politics around the world.”As he flew back to the US,Trump saidKhan was “among the worst mayors in the world”, and claimed that he had asked UK officials not to invite Khan to a state dinner hosted by King Charles in the president’s honor.Unfortunately, the long list of grievances Trump laid out in his UN speech was not limited to politicians and global institutions that he believed had wronged him. Trump spent about a quarter of his speech undermining UN-led efforts to address climate change and ridiculing renewable energy policies. He denied the scientific consensus that humans, through the burning of fossil fuels, are causing global warming,calling it“the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”. Trump added that warnings of severe floods, widespread droughts, extreme heat waves and other climate-related disasters “were made by stupid people”.Trump also celebratedhis decision to withdrawthe US from the Paris climate agreement, which committed nearly all countries in the world to reducing greenhouse emissions and limiting global warming below levels that could lead to catastrophe. He denounced renewable energy sources like solar power and wind farms as a “joke” and praised “clean, beautiful coal”.By the conclusion of his meandering and unhinged speech, Trump tried to advance a dark narrative: that immigration, along with reliance on clean energy sources, posed an existential threat to western nations. “Immigration and the high cost of so-called green, renewable energy is destroying a large part of the free world and a large part of our planet,”Trump said, warning his fellow leaders that, if they don’t emulate his policies restricting migration and expanding the use of fossil fuels, it would “be the death of western Europe”.In the end, Trump wanted what he always craves: attention and adoration – even if he has to unleash fear and chaos to get it.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor, at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicsUnited NationscommentShareReuse this content"

One for the billionaire class. And one for everybody elseWed 24 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 24 Sep 2025 14.07 EDTShareLet’s take a deep breath and, for one moment, forget aboutDonald Trump,Jimmy Kimmel, theUN,Charlie Kirk, Gaza, a government shutdown and the other crises that we face.Let’s talk instead about the reality which the corporate-controlled media and the corporate-controlled political system don’t talk about very much.What we are witnessing right now is the rise of two Americas. One for the billionaire class. And one for everybody else.In one America, the richest people are becoming obscenely richer and have never, ever had it so good. That America is overflowing with unimaginable wealth, greed and opulence that makes the Gilded Age seem very modest.And then there is a second America – an America where a majority of people live paycheck to paycheck, struggling to secure the very basic necessities of life – food, healthcare, housing and education.The simple truth is that never before in our history have so few had so much wealth and power while so many live in economic desperation.In the first America, one man –Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, worth more than $480bn, owns more wealth than the bottom 52% of American households. After spending $290m to put Trump back into the White House, Musk has become more than $180bn richer since election day. That’s a pretty good return on his investment.But that’s apparently not good enough for Musk. In order to keep him “motivated” as CEO, Tesla’s board proposed giving him a $1tn pay package if he meets certain goals. A trillion dollars.Jeff Bezos, the fourth wealthiest person in the world, has a fortune of $233bn. He can sail to Venice on his $500m yacht for his reported $50m wedding, where he gave his wife a $3m-$5m ring – because, among other things, his effective tax rate is just a reported 1.1%.Mark Zuckerberg, the third richest person in the world, is worth $258bn. He has spent $110m to buy 11 homes in Palo Alto, California, to create his own private compound, and another $270m for more than 2,300 acres in Hawaii with a 5,000 sqft underground bunker and three yachts reportedly worth more than $530m.In the other America, where the vast majority of our people live, the economy is not just broken, it is collapsingLarry Ellison, the second wealthiest person in the world – worth $377bn – recently became nearly $100bn richer in a single day. He owns a private island in Hawaii and a fleet of jets, and now he’s reportedly trying to buy up major media companies such as Warner Bros and CNN.Together, these four men alone are worth more than $1.3tn. But it’s not just them. The top 1% now owns more wealth than the bottom 93%.The 1% lives in a world completely removed from ordinary Americans. They don’t ride overcrowded subways to get to work or sit in traffic jams to get home. They fly on private jets and helicopters they own. They live in mansions all over the world, send their kids to the most elite private schools and vacation on their own islands. And, for fun, some spend millions to fly off into space on their own rocket ships.And then there is the other America, where the vast majority of our people live. For them, the economy is not just broken, it is collapsing. In this America, despite a massive increase in worker productivity, real weekly wages for the average American worker are lower today than they were more than 52 years ago.In this America, people are unable to afford a doctor’s visit (if they’re lucky enough to find one); are paying over half of their limited incomes on rent or a mortgage; and are unable to afford the outrageous cost of childcare or send their kids to college. In this America, the price of vegetables, fruit and other healthy foods is beyond the budget for many.For most Americans, the system is not just broken, it is collapsing and is increasingly resembling life in the third world.Everyone needs healthcare. Yet today, more than 85 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured – a number that will rise by at least 15 million under Trump’s so-called big, beautiful bill.Everyone needs housing. Yet today, nearly 800,000 Americans are homeless and more than 20m households pay more than 50% of their limited incomes on rent or a mortgage. Since 2000, average rents have more than doubled and the median price of a home has soared to more than $435,000.Will the Democrats learn from Zohran Mamdani’s victory? | Bernie SandersRead moreEveryone needs a decent education. Yet today, our childcare system is broken and wildly expensive. Many of our public schools are dilapidated with teachers underpaid and underappreciated, and American students are falling behind in math, science and reading compared with their international peers. College education is unaffordable for millions and vocational schools fail to train the workers we desperately need.Everyone needs a secure retirement. Yet, nearly half of older workers have no retirement savings and no idea how they will ever retire with any shred of dignity or respect. Meanwhile, 22% of seniors are trying to survive on an income of less than $15,000 a year.Enough is enough.As supreme court justice Louis Brandeis said in 1933: “We can have democracy in this country or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of the few, but we cannot have both.”That warning is even more relevant today.In this pivotal moment in American history, we must create a government and an economy that works for all, or we will continue sliding into oligarchy – where the billionaire class controls our government, our economy and our future.Let me say to my fellow Americans: I know day-to-day life can take a toll, but we must not allow ourselves to fall into despair. If we do not allow ourselves to be divided up by Trump and his oligarch allies, we can change the path we are on.The choice is clear. Let’s stand together for democracy and justice.Explore more on these topicsUS economyOpinionMark ZuckerbergElon MuskDonald TrumpThe super-richEconomicsUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Yet progress on clean energy shows what’s possible. With political will, cooperation can still avert the worst of the climate crisisWed 24 Sep 2025 16.17 EDTFirst published on Wed 24 Sep 2025 13.20 EDTShareAll is not lost, Simon Stiell, the UN’s climate chief, told the Guardian last week. But the latestplanetary health checkfrom the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research is a brutal reminder of how close the Earth is being pushed beyond repair. Seven of the nine planetary boundaries are now breached, with ocean acidification added to the danger list. Yet the world has proved that cooperation works: the ozone layer is healing, air pollution controls are working. A decisive test looms at the end of the month, when governments must file new climate pledges, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs). This is no time to ease off: the fossil-fuel era must end, and the clean‑energy transition must accelerate.There is real concern that big emitters,including Australiaand the EU, will fall short of what is needed to avoid extreme heating. The EU is set to miss this month’s NDC deadline, while mostfossil-fuel producersplan to cut emissions at the margins instead of phasing out production. Since Donald Trump has withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement, the US will make no fresh commitments at all. At the UN, Mr Trumptrottedout the same stale oil-industry talking points he’s been peddling for years.But there are also encouraging signs, including the fact that global investment in renewables keeps rising. In the first half of 2025 it reacheda record $386bn, 10% higherthan the same period last year. China alone installed more than 250GW of solar power capacity in this brief period –more than twice as muchas the rest of the world combined. However,China’s new NDC targets just 7% to 10% cuts in emissions by 2035– not enough to hit Paris’ goals. It’s the right direction but the wrong speed.Global investment in clean energy, including nuclear and grid upgrades, is also up, and expected to reach around $2.2tn in 2025 – roughly twice the amount being spent on fossil fuels. Since inadequate grids have been an obstacle to the expansion of clean power in many countries,including the UK, this too is good news. However, the rise of anti-climate populists in European states includingGermanyis deeply concerning, and perhaps explains theEU’s increased caution. A “statement of intent” by the bloc last week indicated that it expects to commit to emissions cuts of up to 72.5% by 2035 (compared with 1990 levels), which falls short of the 79% or more that campaigners have pushed for.Responsible politicians everywhere must proactively address voters’ concerns about the impact of green policies on their lives, and keep reminding them how much more costly and dangerous the alternatives to a green transition are. In the US, too, climate policies are progressing – despite the Trump administration’s opposition.About 19 states, and corporations covering two-thirds of US corporate revenues, still back net zero.Renewables growth is essential, but unless carbon emissions are reduced at the same time, net zero is impossible. If planned fossil-fuel projects proceed, global output in 2030 will be more than double the limit for keeping heating to 1.5C. Mr Stiell is right to point to progress as well as threat. The crisis won’t be solved at thisCopor the next. But abandoning the process would mean abandoning hope – and handing victory to the wreckers.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Unfortunately, when that man is the US president, his opinion cannot be ignored.Earlier this year, Donald Trump asserted that Vladimir Putin had “all the cards” and urged Volodymyr Zelenskyy to make peace in terms that resembled surrender. This week,Mr Trump declaredthat Kyiv might achieve total victory, liberating all territory currently under Russian occupation.This assessment follows a process described by the president as “getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia military and economic situation”. Mr Trump offered to continue supplying American weapons for Nato “to do what they want with them”. Asked about Russian incursions into airspace over alliance members, the president suggested the offending jets could be shot down. This was later qualified as a prescription to be followed only “if they’re attacking”.Given Mr Trump’s capacity for hyperbole, self‑contradiction and spouting nonsense, it is hard to evaluate the significance of his sudden enthusiasm for Ukrainian liberation and gung-ho attitude to Moscow’s military provocations.It is not wholly new. His attitude to Mr Zelenskyy has evolved quite gradually, and with assiduous encouragement from European leaders, fromcontempttocourtesyand now something like respect. With Mr Putin he has veered fromcredulous admirationto wary patience to tetchy frustration and back again. He hasset deadlinesfor the Kremlin to stop the killing or face more robust sanctions, and failed to follow through. Asked this week whether he still trusted the Russian president, Mr Trump said he would know in a month’s time.Judging by recent precedent, that leaves ample scope for yet another shift in position; another round of craven indulgence for Kremlin narratives about the war.Such inveterate unreliability makes it hard to divine motive in the White House. Sincere interest in protecting democracy against authoritarian attack and strategic investment in the security of the US’s historical allies are, sadly, not plausible explanations. They wouldn’t be consistent with Mr Trump’songoing assaulton the US’s own constitutional order, or with his well-attested tendency to see everything through the lens of ego and self-aggrandisement.In that context, the likelier reason is ongoing determination to earn plaudits as a great peacemaker, coupled with belated realisation that Mr Putin will not end a war that he still believes he can win. Having tried to bully Ukraine into capitulation, Mr Trump may now be attempting something more like deterrence – ramping up the cost of the war for the Kremlin to see if that moves the dial towards a ceasefire.If so, it is certainly a better plan than appeasement, which only encouraged further aggression. Mr Trump’s assessment of the balance of strength on the battlefield is more optimistic on Ukraine’s behalf than most independent analysis, but it would also become self-fulfilling if followed up with sufficient military aid. The same applies to his gloomy prognosis forRussia’s economyif tougher sanctions are expedited.If Mr Trump is indeed converted to the cause of maximising pressure on the Kremlin as a means to end the war, it is a transformation that Kyiv’s more stalwart allies should welcome but cannot rely upon. It presents a strategic opportunity to be seized and maximised on the understanding that it may not last.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Here’s how to stop him, 19 September). We only have to look to Trump’s America to get a pretty clear idea of what it would mean.Freedland is also correct in his analysis of the level of support for Reform and Farage’s key policies. They do not receive anywhere near majority support: only 31% of voters support Brexit, as against 56% who want to rejoin the EU; nearly 60% want to stay in the European convention on human rights; only 31% believe migrants have undermined British culture. Yet Freedland inexplicably fails to invoke the most obvious solution to the rise of rightwing populism: reform of our voting system.Although the most recentYouGov pollshows Reform on 28% and Labour on 20%, it also shows all “progressive” parties on at least 49% against 45% for Reform and the Conservatives combined.Isn’t then the obvious answer to adopt a voting system that reflects voter preference? Keir Starmer has ignored the votes ofLabourconference on this, and he could be forgiven, with a huge majority on roughly a third of the vote. But would Labour be so happy if the boot were on the other foot: a Reform government with 30% of the vote? Surely, the answer is a voting system that gives voters policies they actually vote for.Barry GreatorexDerbyMy blood ran cold reading Jonathan Freedland’s piece, because his summary was so distressingly accurate. The Trump aide Stephen Miller’s remark that the Democratic party is a “domestic extremist organisation” was particularly chilling. How long before it is banned and the US becomes a truly authoritarian one-party state?So what to do? For a start, the message should be rammed home: “Vote Farage, get Trump”, because if our current leaders are conciliatory, just imagine how supine Reform will be as the US increasingly interferes in other countries’ domestic politics.Jennifer ReesCardiffOn the printed page of the Journal section, Jonathan Freedland’s call to expose the supposed popularity of far-right propaganda was placed next to youreditorial on the importance of grassroots drama training. It is often working‑class actors who bring plays to the stage or screen that shift public consciousness, for example, about misogyny or the Post Office scandal.What we need now are powerful dramas about the rise of reactionary populism and its seductive influence on so many people who do not regard themselves as – and are not – extremists (‘Go-to trope’: how the far right is exploiting violence against women and girls, 19 September).Dr Sebastian KraemerLondonI have sent a postcard toNigel Farageto say that I do not need his protection.Elizabeth BakerBirminghamJonathan Freedland’s article about protecting democracy states that we all need to take action.

But that does not mean large language models have no place in higher education. Used thoughtfully, they can enhance teaching and learning.Graduates will enter a workforce where AI is ubiquitous. To exclude it from education is to send students out unprepared. The task is not to ignore AI, but to teach students how to use it critically.AI can also reinforce learning. Take the example cited by McCann and Sweeney of students mischaracterising Henry Ford as a “transformational leader”. Instead of banning AI, lecturers could ask students to generate an AI response and then critique it against the 1922 text. This highlights the technology’s limitations – anachronistic terms, lack of historical context – while underlining the value of close reading and primary sources.The real problem lies not with AI, but with outdated assessment models. If ChatGPT can easily answer a coursework question, that says as much about the weakness of the assessment as the strength of the tool. Redesigning tasks to test process as well as product can help ensure these tools develop rather than diminish critical skills.Misuse is a genuine concern. But rejecting AI outright risks leaving students ill-equipped.Universitiesshould lead in shaping its ethical, critical and creative use, ensuring it strengthens rather than undermines learning.Dr Lorna WaddingtonDr Richard de Blacquière-ClarksonUniversity of LeedsThe claim from Prof Leo McCann and Prof Simon Sweeney that generative AI “sabotages and degrades students’ learning” risks repeating a familiar pattern in higher education: treating new technologies as threats rather than catalysts for change. When calculators arrived, many feared they would destroy numeracy; instead, curricula shifted to mathematical reasoning. Word processors raised worries about spellcheck eroding writing ability, yet pedagogy evolved to emphasise structure and clarity. Even the internet, once derided as a source of plagiarism and misinformation, ultimately pushed universities to stress information literacy and source evaluation.AI presents real challenges, but history shows the problem is not the tool itself, but assessment practices that fail to adapt. If universities continue to reward only polished products, AI will inevitably be seen as a shortcut. What we need is a shift toward process-based evaluation. This means valuing learning journals that capture students’ decision-making, reflective essays that unpack research strategies, or oral defences where they explain how they reached a conclusion. These approaches do not bypass reflection and criticality – they make them unavoidable.To dismiss AI as “generic” or “factually incorrect” is to overlook its pedagogical potential. Its flaws can themselves be teaching tools: comparing AI drafts with original sources sharpens critical reading, while asking students to critique or refine outputs fosters precisely the analytical and creative skills universities claim to champion.Education has always evolved alongside technology. This moment is no different. The challenge is not to wall off AI, but to rethink our goals so that students graduate both able to use these tools and to think critically about them.Prof Robert StroudHosei University, JapanThe situation regarding university students’ use of AI in the arts and humanities may be even worse than Profs McCann and Sweeney report. In a nutshell: many students don’t attend class (attendance is typically around 30%), don’t sit any in-person exams (which vanished with Covid and haven’t returned), and have their coursework (that is, 100% of their grade) written wholly or largely by AI. Perhaps over half of all students on arts and humanities courses fit this bill. They won’t get the top grades, but a good degree (a mid-2:1) is very gettable in this way. All that their degree certificate will guarantee is that they handed over nearly £30,000.That being so, you might wonder why we don’t cut out the middleman and just hand out degree certificates immediately after payment. And that might well be an option favoured by some university administrators, who then wouldn’t need to worry about such pesky things as having to pay their teaching staff. But for those of us who care about both the quality of higher education and the cultural role of universities, the current situation regarding AI is a disaster.Prof Mark JagoUniversity of NottinghamExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)UniversitiesStudentsTeachingComputingHigher educationlettersShareReuse this content"

Luke Donald and his team may have been booed at the opening ceremony on Wednesday, but the reception they got from the tens of thousands of liquored-up golf fans who had hung around to watch was a warm welcome compared to the one they gave New York state’s governor, the Democrat Kathy Hochul, who was jeered so loudly that her short speech was just about drowned out. Donald should maybe think about bringing her in as a last‑minute vice-captain, just to draw the fire away from his team.“Relax everybody, she’s not Roger Goodell,” said the master of ceremonies, Carson Daly, referencing the unpopular NFL commissioner. It didn’t help. “What should everyone coming here for the first time know about New York?” he asked Hochul. (“She has no idea! She lives in Albany!” bellowed a man standing nearby, “Get her outta here!” roared another.) Hochul, a rictus grin fixed on her face, said something about how “we have the most friendly people you will ever meet” and was immediately shouted down by the locals. “That went well,” Daly said, deadpan, after Hochul beat a retreat from the stage.View image in fullscreenNew York state’s governor, the Democrat Kathy Hochul (left), was jeered by fans at the Ryder Cup opening ceremony.Photograph: Maddie Meyer/PGA of America/Getty ImagesDonald got off lightly in comparison. “New York is a place where if you show up with talent and a fighting spirit the city will get behind you” he said, gamely. “No it won’t!” someone cried back at him. He nearly broke out laughing when they booed him again for saying: “You’ll make us earn every cheer.” He couldn’t help himself but slip in a couple of subtle little digs at the USA team over the way they are being paid to play here this week, but they were so subtle you needed to speak diplomat’s English to pick up on them.Morikawa urges ‘absolute chaos’ from US fans but Rose backs Europe to focusRead more“We’re fuelled by something money can’t buy,” Donald said, a wry smile passed across his face while he let the comment settle, “by resilience, togetherness, and proving people wrong”.You get the impression he has enjoyed every awkward question which has been fired at the US players about it this week. And there have been a lot of them, especially from the European journalists. Before he finished, Donald made a point of offering his thanks to Hochul, who was roundly booed again, just for having the temerity to be mentioned in someone else’s speech.Keegan Bradley followed him on. He spoke about his formative memory of theRyder Cup, which turned out to be one of the most infamous moments in its history. When he was 13 his father had taken him along to watch at Brookline in 1999, when the USA came back from four points back to win in the singles on Sunday. He was one of the people charging around the 17th green when Justin Leonard’s putt went in. Only he misspoke and told everyone it was Justin Rose. Given Rose is 46, and 1999 was his second year as a professional, he couldn’t have been so very offended by the suggestion he was old enough to have done it.View image in fullscreenUS Captain Keegan Bradley leads his team out on to the stage.Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPAIt was a good speech regardless. He told everyone the story about how he used to climb over the fence by the maintenance sheds to play here at Bethpage when it was supposed to be closed while he was a student at St John’s University, and how he once got busted by the park service while he was midway down the 17th, and how he used to work in the coat check room at the Wheatley Hills course, a few miles up the road. He’s a New Englander by birth, but a New Yorker by upbringing, and he closed with: “Go Giants!” The crowd lapped it up.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The opening ceremony of the Ryder Cup is usually one of the most painful spectator events in all sport, especially when it’s held in Europe. This one moved along at a brisk clip, and was soundtracked by the Beastie Boys and Jay-Z, and studded with a helicopter fly-by which was timed to arrive during the closing notes of the national anthem, and a parachute display team who landed just off the 18th fairway. Actually, that last part might have been a better idea on paper, because it took them an awfully long time to arrive, even falling at 80mph, and there was a long pause to fill while everyone watched them drop.View image in fullscreenUS military helicopters perform a flyover at the Ryder Cup opening ceremony as the locals wave the Stars and Stripes.Photograph: John Angelillo/UPI/Shutterstock“This might take a while,” said Daly. “While we’re waiting, does anyone have any questions for the governor?

Just as it seemed he would record his first victory asNottingham Forestmanager in a competition he won last season, Antony levelled for Real Betis to kill the impending party.Igor Jesus scored twice as Forest recovered from Cédric Bakambu’s opener and hit the woodwork in pursuit of a first-half hat-trick but the former Manchester United winger, derided in some quarters after struggling in the Premier League, struck a 85th-minute equaliser.Nottingham Forest’s last European adventure: ‘Klinsmann knows my name!’Read moreCompared to the capitulation last Wednesday in altogether different surroundings at Swansea, this was nothing – the Championship club scored in the 93rd and 97th minute to earn a comeback Carabao Cup victory – but it was a galling finish all the same.Forest under Postecoglou have so far been a double-edged proposition but the overriding feeling for the travelling fans at the final whistle – about 5,000 flocked to Seville, 3,385 were stationed up in the gods in the away end – was probably pride. “Europe again, olé, olé,” they sang as the players headed in their direction.The most appetising takeaway was undoubtedly Igor Jesus’s first goal, a slick team move and an explicit example of Postecoglou’s vision. “I guess that’s the challenge: to make sure the players don’t drop their heads because we’re not getting the victories,” the Australian said. “Some of the football we played was outstanding.”This was a big moment, Forest’s first competitive game on the European stage since March 1996 and, as Postecoglou highlighted, finally an opportunity for the generations of supporters who have heard the stories of yesteryear but not lived the experiences. The thing Postecoglou now craves is that first win and Forest will hope it comes at the fifth time of asking, when Sunderland visit the City Ground for his first home game. “We are in a results business and ultimately we need to convert our good into victories,” Postecoglou said. “If one goes in off one of the boys’ backsides, I won’t be disappointed with that either because we’re missing a bit of luck.”View image in fullscreenIgor Jesus scores Forest’s first European goal for 29 years.Photograph: Marcelo del Pozo/ReutersThe Forest fans sang about trips to Gillingham, Huddersfield, Hull and Rotherham; five years ago on Thursday they lost 1-0 at Huddersfield, with Ryan Yates, a late substitute here, the sole survivor from the squad that day. Evangelos Marinakis has spent millions furnishing the squad since, including £200m this summer so that the squad could compete on all fronts, and amid the celebrations after promotion three years ago, the Greek billionaire vowed to return Forest to Europe. “Sometimes you don’t see the future because you always talk about the past,” he said.Consider this a vision fulfilled, then, Marinakis present as Igor Jesus became Forest’s goalscorer in Europe since Steve Stone’s consolation against Bayern Munich 29 years ago.Betis began quicker and gained the lead after quarter of an hour, Antony skating past Morato and punching a pass into Bakambu, who blasted high into the top corner of Matz Sels’s goal. But they had the upper hand for just three minutes, Igor Jesus applying a simple finishing touch to a wonderful Forest move.Quick GuideEuropa League roundup: Celtic earn point in BelgradeShowThe half-time substitute Kelechi Iheanacho firedCelticahead in Belgrade before the Scottish champions had to settle for a point againstRed Starin their Europa League opener. Iheanacho finished brilliantly as Celtic made a flying start to the second half but they were pegged back by former West Ham, Stoke and Inter forward Marko Arnautovic, who scrambled the ball home after a corner.Brendan Rodgers’ side could not get back on the front foot and would have been more than satisfied to take a 1-1 draw back from Serbia given the overall balance of play in the Rajko Mitic Stadium.Iheanacho had replaced Daizen Maeda at half-time after the Japan international struggled in the centre-forward role. Celtic had failed to make any chances from open play by half-time but they immediately improved, forcing three saves before Iheanacho took an excellent touch in the box and stroked the ball into the top corner in the 55th minute.On the performance of Maeda, who was denied a summer move because of the club's failure to source an adequate replacement, Rodgers told BT Sport: \"He wasn't at his best, or nowhere near it. However, he's a good guy and sometimes that happens in the game. I could have made a couple of changes at half-time. I wanted to make that one certainly to give us that greater reference at the top of the pitch. I thought Kels coming in was very, very good for us.\"We needed someone centrally to hold the ball up. I felt that we arrived into the final third in the first half and then we were either loose with the ball or didn't hold the ball up.\"It's one of Kels' great strengths. He can take the ball in, he can use his body well and obviously allows you to progress up the pitch. So he gave us a really much better platform in the second half.\"Romabegan their campaign with a 2-1 victory atNice,sparked by quickfire goals from defenders Evan N'Dicka and Gianluca Mancini within three minutes early in the second half, after a cautious and uneventful opening period.Terem Moffi pulled one back for the hosts from the penalty spot in the 77th minute after Niccolo Pisilli brought down Antoine Mendy inside the area, setting up a tense finish, but Nice could not find the equaliser despite late pressure.Nice captain Dante became the oldest outfield player in the competition's history at 41. Portuguese sideBragacelebrated a 1-0 home victory over Feyenoord,sealed by Fran Navarro's decisive strike in the 79th minute.PA Media, ReutersWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Forest shifted the ball from left to right, Oleksandr Zinchenko, the left-back having floated to the edge of the opposition 18-yard box, and Elliot Anderson playing one-touch passes before Douglas Luiz located Morgan Gibbs-White, playing on the right of a three-pronged attack. Gibbs‑White slid a diagonal ball across goal and Igor Jesus converted from inside the six-yard box. Postecoglou retreated towards the away dugout, applauding as he went, and more joy followed five minutes later. Douglas Luiz whipped an inswinging corner into the box and Igor Jesus headed in.Forest were in control after acquainting themselves and at half‑time they could reflect on 13 shots to Betis’s one, with Igor Jesus, who also scored twice at Swansea, rattling a post as he came within inches of a 14-minute hat-trick. Forest were rampant and should have extended their lead. Arnaud Kalimuendo, who replaced the cautioned Igor Jesus, fluffed his lines as Forest soared upfield; Zinchenko ignored Dan Ndoye, another substitute, to his left and instead fed Kalimuendo, whose first touch hindered his progress.The size of the task facing Forest was clear at the outset given Betis, eighth in La Liga, had lost just one of their previous 18 home games in European competition. The Betis substitute Pablo Fornals flashed a shot wide and it proved a warning sign the visitors did not heed. Natan, the centre-back, then made a mess of a golden chance a minute later, but Antony seized his.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueReal BetisNottingham ForestEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They did not have the requisite quality and Arsenal scored again, the second coming late from Leandro Trossard. There was doggedness in abundance but Vale’s inability to have a shot on target summed up their shortcomings.Arsenal, Spurs, Man City and Newcastle through to Carabao Cup fourth round – follow the draw liveRead moreThe hosts offered the anticipated blood-and-thunder approach in the opening seconds of the match, spurred on by the biggest Vale Park crowd this century. But before the smoke from the pre-match pyrotechnics settled,Arsenalwere in control and ahead. Gabriel Martinelli found Eze in the middle of the box in the eighth minute, aided by a Myles Lewis‑Skelly dummy, and the former Crystal Palace playmaker calmly placed the ball beyond Joe Gauci.“I’ve been waiting to score for this club for a long time and the first is very special,” Eze said.Mikel Arteta put out a strong team, the only debutant being the world’s most expensive goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga. For all their domination, enjoying more than 80% possession in the match, Arsenal did not test Gauci until Mikel Merino flicked the ball through for Eze but the goalkeeper was off his line quickly to block. Port Vale hassled their way back into the game, lifting the crowd through work-rate as they did their best to pressurise the Gunners. Considering how early Arsenal took the lead, the League One side were boosted by reaching half-time with a single-goal deficit.View image in fullscreenLeandro Trossard doubles Arsenal’s lead in the 86th minute.Photograph: Chris Radburn/ReutersArsenal needed something to silence the majority inside Vale Park but were unable to find their rhythm against a team set up to frustrate. There was greater confidence in the Vale ranks the longer the score stayed at 1-0. They were more eager to send the ball into the Arsenal box and make them think, rather than the conservative approach that was the hallmark of the opening 45 minutes. “In the second half we lost a little bit of grip of the game, especially with the direct play, with all the throws from the sidelines and winning territory and then again,” Arteta said. “We lacked a bit of dominance and control.”Quick GuideCarabao Cup fourth-round drawShowArsenal v Brighton & Hove AlbionGrimsby Town v BrentfordSwansea City v Manchester CityNewcastle United v TottenhamWrexham v CardiffLiverpool v Crystal PalaceWolves v ChelseaWycombe Wanderers v FulhamMatches to be played w/c 27 OctoberWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.If the idea was to get players into a rhythm, Bukayo Saka struggled to cause Vale problems. He was slow in possession and rarely had a chance to run at the defence, often needing to turn back. Saka was booed off in the 63rd minute by the home supporters, who were upset by his reaction to an earlier challenge.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Port Vale could have equalised if they were more dynamic after a misplaced Cristhian Mosquera pass across his own box and a rising drive from Devante Cole kept Arrizabalaga interested until the last second when it whistled over the bar.Instead of celebrating, supporters were silenced, apart from complaints about a potential offside, when a direct ball from William Saliba found Trossard. The substitute took a few touches and fired into the bottom corner from the edge of the box to send Arsenal into the next round and break Vale hearts.“To see this ground packed,” the Port Vale manager, Darren Moore, said of the positives to be taken. “I told the boys if they can bottle tonight and take it into the league we won’t go far wrong.

Because there have been a few of those since 3 February 2024, when they began a surge from the lower reaches of League Two.Grant McCann’s team missed out on promotion via the playoffs, then went up as champions last season and they have started well in League One this time out. During the period, they have collected 143 points; no team in England has more.Phil Foden pulls strings as Manchester City outclass Huddersfield in Carabao CupRead moreTottenham, though, were always likely to prove too much for them. Thomas Frank made it clear when he was unveiled as the club’s manager that he wanted them to compete in all four competitions they were in, and they are up and running in theCarabao Cup.Spurs impressed in the first half, fluffing up a two-goal cushion and, if they coasted after the interval, they never looked in danger of leaving the back-door open, of offering any encouragement for the fairytale.João Palhinha’s goal for 1-0 was the standout moment and after a Jay McGrath own goal it was Brennan Johnson – a threat on the right throughout – who completed the scoring at the very end.It is the Premier League manager who is supposed to make the most changes to his lineup and Frank could have picked a powerful XI from those he started among the substitutes, rested entirely or was unable to select because of injury. Yet McCann outdid his seven changes with nine of his own, the Doncaster manager staying true to his rotation policy in this competition. When he changed all 11 players for the first-round tie at Middlesbrough, his team won 4-0.Doncaster travelled with optimism; their travelling band of 4,000 supporters with characteristic Yorkshire confidence. It was punctured early on when it became clear that Spurs had the pace and skill to hurt them up the wings. How did Mathys Tel miss his kick from point-blank range from a Johnson cross at the outset? It was a mystery.View image in fullscreenJoão Palhinha jumps for joy after scoring an especially fine goal for a centre-half.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PASpurs did not dwell on it and they were ahead when the Doncaster goalkeeper, Ian Lawlor, made a hash of his punch on a Xavi Simons corner and compounded the error by feeling his momentum take him away from goal. Seán Grehan did not get enough distance on the clearing header and Palhinha, who played at centre-half, adjusted his feet before hooking the ball over his shoulder and into the empty net. It was anything but a centre-half’s finish.Spurs made it 2-0 when Wilson Odobert skated past Tom Nixon and crossed low. Lawlor could get nothing on it and the ball went in off the unfortunate McGrath, who was facing the wrong way.It was possible to fear for Doncaster because they were loose at the back, Spurs moving around and through them too easily, the spaces big, the chances coming. When Archie Gray, who played as a right-sided No 8, popped up in the left of the area on to a breaking ball and shaped a curler for the far corner, Lawlor made a fine save.Doncaster came to play. They had flickered at the very start, Toyosi Olusanya fluffing one chance when well placed while there was the moment on 39 minutes when the captain, Owen Bailey, sculpted a lovely volley that Antonin Kinsky pushed against a post.View image in fullscreenBrennan Johnson scores Tottenham’s third goal past Doncaster’s Ian Lawlor.Photograph: Jacques Feeney/Offside/Getty ImagesDoncaster brought the tempo after the second-half restart, trying to get on to the front foot and ask questions. The No 10, Joe Sbarra, flitted with intent while Bailey looked polished in his deeper midfield role. Frank seemed happy to contain, to play on the counter.It felt as though Spurs were sleepwalking a little, the home crowd were subdued – apart from the screaming kids behind the press box – and there were a few worries for Frank, chiefly another dreadfully scuffed finish from Tel. It was disappointing to see a dive in the area from Pedro Porro, for which he was booked.Quick GuideCarabao Cup fourth-round drawShowArsenal v Brighton & Hove AlbionGrimsby Town v BrentfordSwansea City v Manchester CityNewcastle United v TottenhamWrexham v CardiffLiverpool v Crystal PalaceWolves v ChelseaWycombe Wanderers v FulhamMatches to be played w/c 27 OctoberWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Doncaster, though, could not make it happen. Glenn Middletone swelled the side-netting with a free-kick after Kevin Danso had wafted a high boot at Brandon Hanlan, on as a substitute, and it was Spurs who finished the stronger.Frank was able to introduce the 16-year-old Luca Williams-Barnett for his debut on the left and the final word went to Johnson, who finished after being released by another substitute, Lucas Bergvall.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupTottenham HotspurDoncaster Roversmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Football doesn’t work like that – we conceded one chance, in 88 or 89 minutes, and I know from my 10 ­seasons away in the FA Cup orCarabao Cup[playing teams] in the Championship or League One it is tricky – we have always behaved really good.”Guardiola believes Foden is again the force he was 18 months ago. “We have seen already in the last few games – against Arsenal, Napoli and United he was really good,” the manager said. “Phil when playing that position [behind the striker] is a real threat.”Only Foden and Nico O’Reilly were retained from City’s 1-1 draw at Arsenal, with James Trafford given a first start between the sticks since Gianluigi Donnarumma’s signing on transfer deadline day, and Divine Mukasa his debut. The 18-year-old, listed as a midfielder and operating as the No 9, saw a shot blocked, then his header from Foden’s corner gathered by Lee Nicholls, Town’s keeper.Lee Grant’s team had defeated Leicester and Sunderland, both on penalties, in previous rounds, so this tie was the reward in a 13th game of his nascent managerial career. The former Manchester United ­goalkeeper told his men to press, from Dion Charles at the tip to the backline, but the ball moved as quick as the opponents’ collective brain.As for Foden’s opener: the No 47 drifted into a right-hand pocket, received Matheus Nunes’s pass and turned and fed Mukasa, who returned the ball. At long range, Foden executed an expert low finish.View image in fullscreenManchester City’s Savinho scores their second goal in the win at Huddersfield.Photograph: Ed Sykes/Action Images/ReutersCity’s possession was north of 80% and Foden seemed to enjoy most of it, as he orchestrated the contest. Stones was Guardiola’s nominated captain and Foden the spiritual leader, who sprayed balls left to Savinho, popped along the right to feed Oscar Bobb, wandered over to deliver a corner, then rushed back when Town broke.City’s stranglehold raised the premium of any glimmer for Grant’s team so Zépiqueno Redmond’s blast over in the visitors’ area was significant.Foden showed far more composure when he took over in midfield and curved a ball into Rico Lewis; the No 82’s pass into Town’s area was then the correct option, the lack of a colleague to meet it a travesty.Now, though, ­Redmond did far better. He swooped along the left and fed Ben Wiles, whose attempt gave City their first scare, careering past Trafford’s goal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Next up, Savinho dribbled infield and unloaded: the ball went wide of Nicholls’s right post and City seemed right to claim a corner for a deflection that the referee, Michael Salisbury, was not interested in.Instantly City had their hands on Town’s throats again but O’Reilly was ­unable to escape Nicholls’s clutches. Moments later Redmond was, once more, unable to keep his attempt down near Trafford’s goal.Quick GuideCarabao Cup fourth-round drawShowArsenal v Brighton & Hove AlbionGrimsby Town v BrentfordSwansea City v Manchester CityNewcastle United v TottenhamWrexham v CardiffLiverpool v Crystal PalaceWolves v ChelseaWycombe Wanderers v FulhamMatches to be played w/c 27 OctoberWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Kalvin Phillips, whose last City appearance was on 19 December 2023 at the Club World Cup, was spotted of a group of substitutes warming up, and the midfielder watched on when Sean Roughan lifted a rare Town free-kick into the area – Murray Wallace headed over but City knew the game was not yet closed out.Phillips entered on 83 minutes to jeers because of his Leeds United connection; then ­Cameron Ashia hit Trafford’s left post to give Town’s fans a highlight to recall.Of Phillips, Guardiola said: “Yester­day he was a father to Ari and he came this morning from London and is now going back to his wife and the kids.”Grant said he was “super-proud of the group”.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupHuddersfieldManchester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

While motherhood has taught her that, in theory, there are bigger things to worry about than a game of rugby, there is no disguising that victory on Saturday would be the sweetest of redemption stories.Three years ago in Auckland it all came down to the final lineout of a spectacular final: secure possession to set up a familiar driving maul and the trophy would be heading the way of the Red Roses. Instead New Zealand nicked the ball off Ward’s fingertips and, for a second successive tournament, England and their relentless lock forwardhad to settle for honourable defeat.England will not ‘dwell’ on 2022 defeat before World Cup final against CanadaRead moreGiven Ward had long kept a picture in her purse of her No 4 jersey on its peg from 2017 to fuel her motivation levels and the pain of another major defeat was considerable. “It’s a cruel, cruel sport,” she murmured to a couple of us below the stands at Eden Park as she tried her best to rationalise the unthinkable.Yet here she is again, now 32, looking to make it third time lucky while juggling her career alongside being a mum to two‑year‑old Hallie. She freely admits it would mean even more to conquer the world with Hallie (along with her husband, Dave, now the head coach of Ampthill) up in the stands. “To have her pitchside, to be able to see her in the crowd when we line up to sing the anthem, it’s so special. She’s the biggest Red Roses fan and it’s amazing to be able to share that with her.”So, no pressure. Ward, though, is adamant the Red Roses will not wilt under the heavy weight of expectation and the presence of a world-record 82,000 crowd for a standalone women’s fixture this weekend. “Yes, we have never played in front of 82,000 but what we have experienced is huge crowds, pressure games and pressure moments. And we’re at home. We are used to getting off the bus and doing that walk [through the crowd], we are used to the roar and the noise. We love it and thrive off that.”View image in fullscreen‘We are used to getting off the bus and doing that walk,’ says Abbie Ward of pre-match crowds.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersTactically speaking the aim is not to reinvent the wheel; as Ward makes clear, the squad have been preparing for this game “for what seems like three years”. And during that time the Bristol forward has been driven by both a motivation to show that mothers can come back stronger after childbirth and to help her team to inspire the next generation of young girls and boys.“To see the number of young girls on their mum’s or dad’s shoulders, watching our games, facepaint on, waving flags, it’s unbelievable. It’s about more than what we’re doing on the pitch. It’s about inspiring that generation and showing girls that they can do it; that they can be strong, powerful, and put their minds to whatever they want to.”The women’s game has certainly come a long way since Ward’s distant representative debut. “My first cap was away in Swansea when we lost to Wales and there must have been 40 people in the crowd. If you had told me then that in 2025 I would be playing in a World Cup final at a sold-out Twickenham, I could not even have contemplated that.To see the number of young girls on their mum or dad’s shoulders, facepaint on, waving flags, it’s unbelievable“I am so proud to have been part of the women’s rugby journey. It’s more than just a game, it’s all of us. It means an awful lot and to have my daughter as part of that is so special.”And while Hallie is clearly a rugby connoisseur – apparently she likes to watch videos of Amy Cokayne while having her hair brushed – she remains unaware of how much her arrival has altered her mum’s outlook. Where previously Ward was “quite a serious individual” and “very process driven”, her eyes have been opened to the role of enjoyment in high‑performance sport.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I thought: ‘I’m just going to enjoy the experience.’ It’s helped me not take it so seriously.”View image in fullscreenAbbie Ward says her two-year-old daughter, Hallie, is now her inspiration in rugby.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAnd instead of the old picture in her purse, she now has a different driver. “If you want to know about that photo, it’s on my wall with a load of different Polaroids from big and meaningful moments across the years. Although they might not have been the moments we wanted to feel in 2017 and 2022, they have got us to where we are. But Hallie is my motivation now. When we’re working really hard or doing horrible sessions on the pitch I’ll think: ‘Pretend Hallie is at the end.’ It does give me that extra boost. It means an awful lot.”All of which will keep Ward fighting to the finish on Saturday in pursuit of complete career fulfilment. For now, though, she has no plans to retire, citing Alun Wyn Jones, Sam Whitelock and Courtney Lawes as warrior inspirations and all that matters is the here and now.“‘Redemption’ or whatever would be the easy thing to say. It’s a different squad, it’s a different opposition, it’s a different World Cup. I feel like we are in a new age of women’s rugby, a new age of sold-out stadiums and millions of people tuning in. Dwelling on any of the other [finals] wouldn’t serve any purpose. It’s all about this Saturday.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Rugby World Cup 2025England women's rugby union teamWomen's rugby unionRugby unioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

The England international wrote on Instagram that she was “done being quiet” and wanted to address the matter to ensure steps are taken to stop it happening.The news came shortly after Tottenham’s Subway League Cup victory on penalties against Aston Villa, in the group stages of the competition. Naz started the game and played all of the first half, but was withdrawn at half-time.WSL players to resume taking knee after Jess Carter abuse prompted refusalRead more“The club is disgusted by the racist abuse received by Jessica Naz via social media,” a Tottenham statement read. “Jess has spoken out against this disgraceful behaviour – and we stand by her in calling out this unacceptable and cowardly act.“We are working with the appropriate authorities and social media platforms to identify the responsible party, and we will be taking the strongest action against them. There is no place for racism in our sport or anywhere in society. We stand with Jess.”Naz, who has six England caps, wrote on Instagram: “I was going to wait till after the game to speak because I’m done being quiet. I was subjected to racial abuse in my DMs. Racism in any form is unacceptable and [it] is important to address this behaviour and ensure that steps are taken to prevent it from happening again.”The game finished 0-0 in normal time, before the hosts Tottenham won 7-6 in a penalty shootout to claim an extra point for the group stage.There were also wins in the opening group games on Wednesday for Manchester City, Nottingham Forest, Leicester City, London City Lionesses, West Ham, Brighton and Liverpool, while Sheffield United and Birmingham City – like Tottenham – both claimed two points after penalty-shootout victories.Explore more on these topicsTottenham Hotspur WomenWomen's footballRaceOnline abusenewsShareReuse this content"

Once inside, an image of Beard and his trademark smile was displayed on a screen above a table where red and white flowers – one bouquet accompanied by a handwritten note expressing love from Sunderland – lay next to the books of condolence that were quickly filling up with messages of love.The scene was so sombre, it was, momentarily, difficult to imagine there was a game of football to watch, but soon the Liverpool fans were inside the stadium for the first match since the news ofBeard’s sudden death at the age of 47.The attendance was – as expected for a League Cup group-stage fixture against lower-league opposition – on the low side but more than 4,000 will be in this ground on Sunday when Liverpool host Manchester United in the Women’s Super League and the tributes to Beard will continue. Still, the Wednesday match programmes, dedicated to Beard, all rapidly sold out.Among the crowd were Beard’s brother, Mark, and his mother, Margaret, as well as several players from Beard’s time in charge, including the former England and Liverpool striker Natasha Dowie.View image in fullscreenMatt Beard’s contribution to the club will be fondly remembered by supporters.Photograph: Nick Taylor/Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesThe players walked out to an emotional rendition of You’ll Never Walk Alone, which was sung quietly, like the gentle whisper of a prayer compared with the roaring versions usually heard at Anfield, but the sound was no less stirring. The coaching staff of both teams all linked arm-in-arm before a moment’s silence was observed impeccably.And while in many ways the outcome of the game had scarcely felt less important, it was also a salient time for Liverpool to secure their first victory of the season – not just for Beard but for themselves, after two defeats from their opening two WSL game.On this emotional night they outplayed Sunderland for a 5-0 victory, much to the delight of their supporters, some of whom waved a flag bearing the words: “Liverpool was made for Matt and Matt was made for Liverpool”.The home fans sang “Matt Beard’s mighty Reds” loudly throughout the 13th and 14th minutes, in reference to the years 2013 and 2014 when Beard led the club to back-to-back WSL titles.View image in fullscreenJenna Clark was one of four Liverpool players to get their names on the score sheet.Photograph: Nick Taylor/Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesBy then, they were already 1-0 up, and fittingly the opening goal had come from Gemma Evans, a player Beard signed for Liverpool in 2024 and had also played under him at Bristol City briefly in 2021. She blew a kiss up towards the sky in celebration after she headed home from Fuka Nagano’s seventh-minute cross.From another header from a defender, this time Jenna Clark, the hosts doubled their lead, and after the game she said: “It’s been a very emotional few days for everyone – we’ve pulled through as a team as best as we could.”Risa Shimizu scored the goal of the night as she skilfully lobbed the goalkeeper with a volley. Sophie Román Haug, on as a substitute, added two close-range finishes in the second half to complete the rout.Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballLiverpool FC WomenSunderland WomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But in playing the last two minutes of Spalding’s backs-to-the-wall away win atBurySt Edmunds, Lewis White was carrying a guilty secret: he had gone to the wrong Bury first.The 24-year-old had travelled for the Southern Football League Premier central fixture against Bury Town under his own steam and driven from his home in Leicestershire. Instead of heading east to Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, however, he drove north to Bury in Greater Manchester, and added 200 miles to his journey in the process.First reportedby LincsOnline, White appears to have driven all the way to Bury FC’s Gigg Lane before realising his error. After schlepping back down the A14, he arrived at Getaway Cars Stadium, home of Bury Town, in time to help close out victory for the Tulips, with Spalding winning 2-1 despite playing with 10 men.Their manager, Jimmy Dean, said: “I asked the people at Bury if it had ever happened before and they said it hadn’t,. He must have been in a world of his own, but he’s come and helped see the game out for us and it’s always a fantastic feeling to win a midweek match.”Spalding moved up to fourth on the back of the result, ahead of Quorn on goal difference but four points off the leaders, Harborough. Their next fixture is an FA Cup qualifying round fixture against Dagenham & Redbridge on Saturday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Indian national, who arrived in the UK on a small boat in August, was flown into Paris from Heathrow.A fifth man, who is from Eritrea, has won a high court ruling placing a temporary block on his deportation. The Home Office wasrefused permission to appealon Tuesday.Three other people whose claims have been rejected – men from Afghanistan, Eritrea and Iran – have been flown toFrance.The move comes days after Donald Trump told the prime minister to “call out the military” to stop small boats as the number of crossings had hit a then record high, and claimed illegal migration could “destroy” countries.The business secretary, Peter Kyle, later said the Royal Navy could be called upon to tackle the crossings “if needed”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will continue to detain and remove those who arrive by small boat. And we will work with France to operate a legal route for an equal number of eligible migrants to come to the UK subject to security checks.”More than 1,000 people reached the UK on small boats on Friday, bringing the total to more than 32,000 so far this year.The director of external affairs at the Refugee Council, Imran Hussain, said of the first arrivals under the “one in, one out” scheme: “This is a really welcome step. No family should ever have to risk their lives in a flimsy boat just to reach safety.“By opening up safe and legal routes, we not only give children and parents the chance to rebuild their lives with dignity, but we take power away from the smugglers who profit from people’s desperation.”In a separate development, the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has ordered a review into the multimillion-pounduse of taxis by asylum seekersin hotels to transport them to medical appointments. The BBC reported on Tuesday that asylum seekers were being taken by taxi to GP or hospital appointments hundreds of miles away, with one running up a bill of £600 for one journey.The broadcaster gained access to four migrant hotels where it claimed there appeared to be a “constant stream of cabs arriving and leaving”. After the report, Mahmood asked the Home Office to investigate the use of taxis to transfer asylum seekers at the public’s expense.A Home Office spokesperson said: “The home secretary has asked the department to urgently look into the use of taxis to transfer asylum seekers.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficeFranceForeign policyEuropeRefugeesMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The concern is that women will be left with no options to manage pain in pregnancy.”Cassidy, who is up for re-election to the Senate next year, expanded on his comments in aninterview with the Hill.“You’re going to change a medical guideline without science?” he told the site, referring to last week’sSenate testimony by Susan Monarez. She said during a hearing that she was sacked as head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after Kennedy pressed her to approve new childhood vaccination recommendations regardless of scientific data.“I mean, you’re going to build a bridge without physics? You’re going to fly a plane without engineering?”Other Republicans supported Cassidy’s critique, including Susan Collins, a senator for Maine.“It appears that [Monarez] was under a lot of pressure to approve recommendations that may come from the [vaccine advisory] committee that may lack scientific basis, so that is disturbing and would undermine our public health efforts,” Collins told the Hill.“I’m very pleased that Chairman Cassidy is having these hearings.”Lisa Murkowski, a senator for Alaska, called Monarez’s description of the workings of Kennedy’s vaccine policy committee “very unsettling and very concerning”.Others said Kennedy threatened to become a political liability for Trump.“You see a lot of Republicans starting to break ranks here, and there’s a lot of noise. I think it will come down to Trump and what his tolerance level is for all this noise around [Kennedy],” one unnamed senator told the Hill.“I don’t think he likes all the noise. He hasn’t liked that previously. He has a really low tolerance level for that, but Bobby Kennedy is different. He’s not like anyone else in the cabinet.”Medical bodies including the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists haveendorsed the use of acetaminophen– a principal ingredient of Tylenol – as a treatment for fever and pain during pregnancy after Trump advised women during Monday’s press conference to avoid taking the drug and instead “tough it out”.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpRobert F Kennedy JrTrump administrationUS politicsHealth policyRepublicansUS healthcarenewsShareReuse this content"

Citizens Advice is calling on companies to automatically offer existing customers their most competitive prices.On average, people who do call to negotiate for money off can save more than £325 annually across their mobile and broadband bills, the charity found.Haggle, bundle or switch: how to get the best UK broadband dealRead moreLoyal customers who do not opt to negotiate are losing out on £28m in savings every month, it said. Almost one in five consumers do not negotiate or switch.Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “For too long, mobile and broadband providers have forced consumers to go through the charade of pretending to leave in order to access hidden renewal deals.“Millions of people are still paying over the odds for something as essential as mobile and broadband because of this murky practice.”The research found that 78% of people who try to negotiate by phone find at least one of the steps they have to go through to be difficult. More than half said this difficulty involved being put on hold, and 43% said they were forced to navigate confusing call menus to speak to the right person.Earlier this month,Ofcom, the media and communications regulator, said its “One Touch Switch” process to make it easier to change provider had helped 1.6 million people in its first year.Ofcom said the service helps broadband and landline customers to “switch seamlessly”, with more than 300 providers signed up to One Touch Switch.Ofcom has previously clamped down on practices such asmid-contract bill increases. AGuardian investigationin 2023 exposed “greedflation” in the telecoms sector, with millions of people facing mid-contract rises in monthly payments of up to 17.3%Citizens Advice is calling on Ofcom to make all telecoms pricing transparent.“We want to see Ofcom clamp down on long-overdue transparency on pricing, closing the gap between what deals are on the table and what’s kept under the counter,” said Moriarty. “Ofcom has taken some welcome steps to strengthen protections for consumers, but this loophole needs to be closed.”Explore more on these topicsMobile phonesBroadbandHousehold billsConsumer affairsOfcomnewsShareReuse this content"

Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his ‘talent’ was never there.”“I think we’re going to test ABC out on this,” he added.“Let’s see how we do.

This one sounds even more lucrative,” Trump said, seemingly referring to thesettlement he reached with ABC Newslast year in a defamation lawsuit filed against the network.In his return, Kimmel was neither conciliatory nor fiery. He decried his suspension as “anti-American” – “this show is not important,” he said, “what is important is that we get to live in a country that allows us to have a show like this” – and clarified his stance on Kirk’s death. “It was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man,” he said. “I don’t think there’s anything funny about it.”The rise and fall of Disney: how the company found then lost its backboneRead more“Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions of what – it was obviously a deeply disturbed individual,” he added. “That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make, but I understand that to some that felt either ill-timed or unclear, or maybe both. And for those who think I did point a finger, I get why you’re upset. If the situation was reversed, there’s a good chance I’d have felt the same way.”Kimmel also praised Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, for offering the accused killer forgiveness in a televised memorial service over the weekend.“Look, I never imagined I would be in a situation like this,” he later said. “I barely paid attention in school.

But in the process, the flies do the plant a major favour by helping to pollinating them.Intrigued as to what attracted the flies, Mochizuki analysed chemicals released by the plant and found a cocktail of volatile compounds including nonane, undecane and other substances known as 8Ac, 10Ac and 6-MMS.He then analysed pheromones released by ants in a jar when they were attacked by a jumping spider. These substantially overlapped with the odours released by the dogbane, according to the report inCurrent Biology.“When attacked, ants release alarm pheromones to alert their nestmates to danger,” Mochizuki said. “Spiders that specialise in preying on ants digest their internal tissues and usually leave behind the exoskeleton.”Country diary: The sound of a dragonfly is a 300m-year-old whisper | Paul EvansRead moreIn further experiments, Mochizuki used a Y-shaped maze to see which odours most appealed to the fruit flies. The insects were not attracted to crushed ants, but did head for ants that had been attacked by spiders. The flies feed on the body fluids of injured insects.While some insects are known to mimic ant pheromones so they can gain access to ant nests and feed on their larvae, the dogbane is the first plant known to pull off a similar trick. And it is extremely effective, Mochizuki said.“The odour of injured ants emitted byVincetoxicum nakaianumflowers has a striking effect in attracting pollinators,” he said.Explore more on these topicsInsectsPlantsSpidersJapanWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

Yet she regularly sees dead birds, their bodies entangled in plastic, among piles of waste washed up on the island’s beaches after powerful storms.“In January, we hadStorm Éowyn,” she says. “Huge storm surges brought piles of plastic on to the beach close to my house. I saw dead birds wrapped in plastic. It was obvious from little bits inside their decomposing bodies they had eaten plastic.View image in fullscreenIslanders untangling fishing floats from a stag’s antlers on Jura.Photograph: Tabby Fletcher“There was a dead goat too – its head stuck in a plastic fishing net. It’s really horrible.”She decided to start a petition calling on the Scottish government to ban all single-use plastics. This has now received more than 26,000 signatures and the backing of MSPs in the Highlands and Islands.“Around 50% of the plastic we use in the UK is single use, and by cutting these items out it creates a more sustainable footprint in the natural world,” she says.She describes images she has seen of red deer, which feed on seaweed, entangled in washed-up fishing nets.“If they are left to their own devices, they can starve to death. There are fibres of plastic that come off the netting too,” she says.Plastic endangers seabirds, seals and other wildlife through ingestion, entanglement and toxic contamination, while microplastics – tiny particles from broken-down plastic – pose a long-term threat to wildlife and human health. It can contain any ofmore than 16,000 chemicals, many of them linked to health issues.The teenager says that although her community organises beach clean-ups, plastic pollution is a growing problem that will only worsen unless action is taken nationally.“I’m from a very small community. You don’t get to aim big when you are somewhere small,” she says. “So it’s good to see people writing to me and having the same thoughts and beliefs as I have.“I’m hoping that Scotland will become the first country in the UK to ban single-use plastics. At the very least, we should have a conversation to prove that it is possible.”She chose to focus on single-use plastic, rather than the plastic fishing nets or “ghost gear” that make up20% of marine plastic pollution, because the Scottish government has already proposed introducing measures totackle waste fishing equipment.View image in fullscreenPlastic flotsam and jetsam washed up in Jura.Photograph: Courtesy of Tabby FletcherThe amount of single-use plastic collected on beaches in the UK and the Channel Islandswas up 9.5% in 2024, compared with 2023, according to the Marine Conservation Society’s annualState of our Beachesreport.Tabby’s petition will be discussed on 24 September by a petitions committee of MSPs. Next steps could include recommending wider debate, a short inquiry or recommending government actions.MSPs for the Highlands and Islands say Tabby’s concerns echo those of their constituents.Emma Roddick, a Scottish National party MSP for the region, says she supports the petition. “The government could be doing more,” she says. “It’s nice to see a young person taking action like this.”Buoyant, the size of a lentil and almost impossible to recover: how nurdles are polluting the oceansRead moreRoddick says she has heard from constituents on the islands of Eigg and Skye and the Knoydart peninsula about “tiny threads” of plastic washing up on beaches, adding that these were very difficult for communities to clean up.A blanket ban, however, would be difficult to implement, she says. “For instance, in the NHS, there are plastic items we haven’t found a substitute for. It is also difficult for the government to ban anything we don’t have absolute power over.”Ariane Burgess, Green MSP for Highlands and Islands, says she is “incredibly impressed” by Tabby’s campaign and fully supports her petition. “The amount of plastic waste washing up on coastal communities’ shore is overwhelming,” she says.Kim Pratt, circular economy campaigner at Friends of the Earth Scotland, says: “The first thing the government needs to do is to enforce the existing ban“The Scottish government has banned some single-use plastics, such as cutlery, plates and expanded-polystyrene food containers, but it is not enforced,” she says. “Creating a ban without acting on it is meaningless.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentSeascape: the state of our oceansScotlandPlasticsPollutionMarine lifeWildlifeBirdsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, coal and oil burning for power generation, and the burning of fossil fuels in industrial facilities, pollute the air with particulate matter called PM2.5, which hasserious health impacts when breathed in.A newinteractive map from Climate Trace, a coalition of academics and analysts that tracks pollution and greenhouse gases, shows that PM2.5 and other toxins are being poured into the air near the homes of about 1.6 billion people. Of these, about 900 million are in the path of “super-emitting” industrial facilities – including power plants, refineries, ports and mines – that deliver outsize doses of toxic air.The organisation highlighted 10 urban areas particularly badly affected by super-emitters, including Karachi in Pakistan; Guangzhou in China; Seoul in South Korea; and New York in the US, where leaders from around the world are meeting this week for the UN general assembly.Raising the alarm over air pollution is seen by some in the US as a way to counter Donald Trump’s moves todismantle work by the federal government aimed at tackling the climate crisis. The US president has shut down federal climate programmes, ordered an end to renewable energy projects, andissued a climate report that scientists called a “mockery”.At the UN general assembly on Tuesday, hedenounced climate science as a “con job”. His words wereswiftly refuted by scientists.But Trump’s government claims to be willing to consider some forms of combating pollution. His environmental adviser Ed Russo gave an address to the climate week hosted by Brazil last month in Rio de Janeiro, beforeBrazil’s presidency of the Cop30 climate summit this November. Russo referred approvingly to the fight against pollution from waste dumps, landfills and other sources. “The impacts of pollution are the critical problem in all of this,” he said, in avideo message. “We have to clean up the messes that we made and stop pollution at its source.”However, he did not say how the Trump administration would seek to clean up toxins, and environmental groups are concerned at theapparent stripping of protectionsfor clean water and air amidrestructuring and rollbacks at the main regulatory body, the US Environmental Protection Agency.Al Gore, a former US vice-president and co-founder of Climate Trace, said there was a clearlink between human health and fossil fuel burning. “Facilities that burn fossil fuels are the overwhelmingly dominant source of heat-trapping pollution that is driving the climate crisis – by using the sky as if it were an open sewer. The particulate air pollution they also create falls downwind into surrounding neighbourhoods and is causing the deaths of 8.7 million people per year,” he said. “Now that we can clearly see how and where people are being exposed to this harmful pollution, our leaders must do something to reduce it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But I don’t think it is reformable.”Regenvanu’s comments came after Trump used his speech at the UN general assembly to call the climate crisis a “con job” and make thinly veiled threats against countries backing renewable energy projects, which he is dismantling in the US while boosting fossil-fuel production.The production and use of fossil fuels are driving the climate crisis, which is turbocharging deadly extreme weather including heatwaves, hurricanes, drought and wildfires across the US – none of which were mentioned in Trump’s climate denialist rant at the UN.In stark contrast, Vanuatu, an archipelago located east of northern Australia whose 330,000 inhabitants, culture, food sources and land are facing existential threats from the climate crisis, has a long history of leadership in climate diplomacy.Vanuatu began calls for a loss-and-damage fund in 1992 – which was finally established atthe 2023 Cop in Dubai– and was among the first countries to call for the recognition of ecocide as a fifth crime against humanity under the Rome statute. It was also among the first backers of the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty and then led the charge on the ICJ case after a group of law students lobbied the government in 2019.The ICJ judges found that 1.5C is a legally binding non-negotiable limit and all states are obliged to implement evidence-based measures to cut greenhouse-gas emissions to curtail global heating and protect the climate system.Fossil fuels are causing widespread harm to human health, ecosystems, the oceans and the climate, and government support for the production and consumption of oil, gas and coal through subsidies and licenses may “constitute an internationally wrongful act which is attributable to that state”, the advisory opinion found.“The fossil-fuel industry has captured everything, from politics, to the media, and general discourse. It is the power of the fossil-fuel industry that is the central power in the current world dynamic” and the biggest obstacle to tackling the climate crisis and implementation of the ICJ ruling, according to Regenvanu.The fossil-fuel industry spentat least $445m in the last US electioncycle to influence US politicians, especially Trump and Republicans. Since winning re-election and taking control of both Houses, Trump has slashed environmental regulations while his signature legislative package gives oil and gas firms$18bnin tax incentives.Trump’s actions are not limited to domestic policy.In recent months, the US, the largest historical greenhouse-gas emitter, has rescinded climate finance commitments that it owes, according to international law, to countries harmed by its dependence on fossil fuels. Trump has also withdrawn from key international forums including the UN climate talks and the International Maritime Organization (IMO), threatening to retaliate against international efforts to decarbonize shipping and transition to renewable energy sources.Amid unprecedented hostility from the US and widespread geopolitical tensions, Vanuatu is now working on a resolution to the UN that will likely be tabled after Cop30 in Belen, Brazil.The resolution is unlikely to be passed unanimously like the March 2023 Vanuatu resolution which led to the ICJ case, but is expected to gain the support of a large majority of countries and would be an important step in the ICJ findings becoming workable obligations.“We’re not getting anywhere with consensus-based decision-making because a few states can hold everyone else to ransom and stop new environmental safeguarding conventions like the plastic treaty, the universal levy on shipping and at Cop. The only place that’s kind of safe from that is the UN general assembly, where it’s a majority vote,” Regenvanu told the Guardian.“In certain forums it’s better the US isn’t there. We have less obstruction and less resistance in the room, so we can get more done … But look, every month there is another disaster in the US, people are already dying here. Eventually the day of reckoning will come for the US, and sooner or later something has to change.”Explore more on these topicsVanuatuClimate crisisParis climate agreementPacific islandsInternational court of justiceAsia PacificGreenhouse gas emissionsnewsShareReuse this content"

The women all received their first screening invitation between 1991 and 2020 and were monitored for up to 25 years.After taking into account social, economic, reproductive, and health-related factors, the researchers found almost one in three (32%) women did not attend their first mammogram appointment.Not attending a first screening was linked with a significantly higher risk of breast cancer death – 9.9 deaths per 1,000 women over 25 years – compared with seven in those screened.These women were also less likely to attend subsequent screenings and were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage breast cancer than those who were screened.In contrast, the 25-year breast cancer rate was similar between groups. This suggests that the higher death risk among those not attending a first appointment reflects delayed detection rather than increased incidence of the disease, the team said.The researchers wrote: “First screening non-participants had a 40% higher breast cancer mortality risk than participants, persisting over 25 years.“If early screening behaviour is predictive of later stage diagnosis and mortality risk, it could provide a valuable opportunity to identify populations at high risk decades before adverse outcomes occur.”Responding to the studyin a linked editorial, US researchers said the results showed attending a first appointment was about “far more than a short-term health check”.For most women, the first screening appointment is unlikely to result in a cancer diagnosis or signal any areas of concern.But even just turning up and getting information about how to reduce their risk and what symptoms to look out for can act as “a long-term investment in breast health and survival”, the US researchers said.Breast screening programme eligibility varies around the world. In England, women are invited for breast screening from the age of 50 up to the age of 71. All women should have received a first invitation for a mammogram by the age of 53.The latest NHS data shows 70% of eligible women were up to date with breast screening as of March 2024, meaning almost one in three were not.Claire Rowney, the chief executive of the BreastCancerNow charity, said “a worryingly high number of women” missed their first appointment. Urgent action was needed to ensure women were encouraged to get screened, and that it was easily accessible to all invited, she added.Separate research showed the annual global cancer death toll was forecast to rise by nearly 75% to 18.6m by 2050. New cases are expected to rise 61% in the next 25 years to 30.5m, according to the studypublished in The Lancet.A global team of researchers said the trend was mostly a result of population growth and an increasingly ageing population.But they also said 42% of cancer deaths were linked to risks that could be modified, including smoking, unhealthy diets, high blood sugar and exposure to toxins.In more hopeful news, it emerged on Wednesday that scientists have uncovered a target for drug treatments that could stop pancreatic cancer in its tracks.Researchers looked into the most aggressive and most common form of this cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).They found in a series of experiments that blocking a protein, known as SPP1, could stop the spread of the cancer and increase survival time. The findings,published in the journal Nature, could lead to medicines targeting the protein.Axel Behrens, a professor of stem cell biology at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said the team had “identified a protein that, when blocked, can prevent cancer from spreading around the body and can hopefully keep patients living well for longer”.The next step will be to develop a drug that can precisely target the protein, he said.Explore more on these topicsBreast cancerWomen's healthCancerWomenHealthMedical researchSwedennewsShareReuse this content"

Attenders would be chosen by lottery, it said, “ensuring a fair balance of gender, region and background”, and a final decision would be taken by a digital vote involving all members.Corbyn did not mention Sultana in the video but twice expressed regret for the row, which threatened to blow up the party.The video does feature two fleeting glimpses of Corbyn’s co-founder, including one from behind as she speaks on a panel and one shot of her holding a banner with other MPs.Corbyn and Sultana: the needs of the left are greater than any of your differences | Owen JonesRead moreHe said: “We’ve had some fraught days in the last week, as you will no doubt be very aware. And to be honest, we haven’t covered ourselves in glory. But what is most important is this: We all agree about the plans for the conference and the road map to get to it.“Once the party is established at the conference, the role that I and other Independent Alliance MPs have been playing to get it off the ground will end.“Our role is not to run the party, not to control it, not to direct it. It is merely to steward the founding of the party that will belong to the grassroots, to the members, who will make the key decisions and elect a leadership through one member, one vote.”On Wednesday evening, Sultana posted on X: “I’m a member of Your Party – and if you haven’t joined yet, you should too. I’ll remain a fierce advocate for the grassroots – and will continue to fight hard for maximum member democracy.“For those who joined the previous system: data and membership will be migrated across in due course. We have a world to win. Let’s get to work!”On Wednesday Sky News reported that Corbyn had yet to secure the ACC Liverpool to host the conference despite announcing it as the venue. The venue will host the Labour party conference this week.An ACC spokesperson told Sky: “All event enquiries are handled in strict confidence between our team and prospective clients, therefore we are unable to provide any further comment on this matter.”Explore more on these topicsJeremy CorbynZarah SultananewsShareReuse this content"

Breaching that interdict would be a contempt of court, exposing campaigners to the risk of imprisonment.Mowi tried and failed to impose a similar exclusion area against Staniford but that restriction was thrown out on appeal. Staniford said Mowi is pursuing him for £123,000 in court costs and legal costs – a bill he is unable to pay.Nik Williams, a policy officer with the Index on Censorship and a co-chair of the UK Anti-Slapp coalition, said sweeping bans of this kind, particularly if the interdict appeared to include anyone associated with Staniford, had a chilling effect on public debate.He said: “Anywhere there are legal constraints like this, people will step back scrutinising these incredibly influential industries”, adding it was “quite concerning” that Bakkafrost was seeking a 15-metre exclusion area despite knowing that Mowi’s application to do so had failed.Bakkafrost wants its “extended interdict” to include Staniford “by himself or by his agents, employees, or servants, or by anyone acting on his behalf or under his instructions, or procurement”.In the first day of the hearing, Staniford’s lawyer, Nicole Hogg, told the sheriff, Laura Mundell, the judge presiding over the case, that Bakkafrost wanted sweeping restrictions on him without specifying why they were needed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Instead, McFadden defended London’s reputation as a global city.Khan later launched a blistering attack on Trump. He said: “I think President Trump has shown he is racist, he is sexist, he is misogynistic and he’s Islamophobic.”TheLondonmayor also subtly criticised senior Labour figures, including the prime minister, for not calling out Trump’s rhetoric.Trump has been publicly attacking the mayor of London since 2015, when Khan criticised the then presidential candidate for suggesting that Muslims should be banned from travelling to the US.In an address to the UN general assembly, Trump said: “I look atLondon, where you have a terrible mayor, terrible, terrible mayor, and it’s been changed, it’s been so changed. Now they want to go to sharia law. But you are in a different country, you can’t do that.”Pressed on what he made of Trump’s description of him as a “terrible, terrible mayor”, Khan pointed to the record numbers of American visitors and investors choosing London.He said: “Since records began, there’s only been a period where more Americans have come to London.“There must be a reason for that. You look at a number of different criteria: we’re often the No 1 city in the globe when it comes to culture, when it comes to foreign investment, when it comes to sports, when it comes to the ability of people to fulfil their potential. I’m really proud we are the greatest city in the world.”LiveSadiq Khan says Trump is ‘racist, sexist, misogynistic and Islamophobic’ – videoKhan did not directly criticise the prime minister, McFadden and others who are yet to directly call out Trump’s rhetoric, but he indicated “they should have the confidence to”, given the UK and US have a special relationship.Asked whether Starmer should be befriending Trump, Khan said: “One of the things about having a special relationship, it’s akin to having a best friend. I think when you have a best friend, you should expect more from them.“It’s very different to an acquaintance or somebody who’s just, you know, a distant friend. I think one of the advantages of having a special relationship with the USA is obviously when it comes to trade, when it comes to military alliances.“When it comes to other areas, where we work closely together, but it should also mean you’ve got the confidence to call them out when they’re wrong. I think President Trump is wrong in many, many ways.”Zack Polanski, leader of the Green party, praised Khan’s response as “exactly what the leader of a diverse and vibrant city like London should say”.“These words only amplify the silence coming from those in Westminster who seem unable or unwilling to speak out,” Polanski wrote on X.Rosena Allin-Khan, the MP for Tooting, said on X that the US ambassador to the UK, Warren Stephens,should be “summoned and challenged over Trump’s rampant Islamophobia”.Dawn Butler, the MP for Brent East, added: “Now is the time to stick up for your country. Don’t let Trump lie about us in this way.”Last week, Trump described Khan as “among the worst mayors in the world” and claimed he had made sure Khan was not invited to the banquet he attended at Windsor. Sources close to the mayor said this was false.McFadden referred to Trump’s long-running dispute with Khan and said: “I think the two of them have had a beef for some years.”The work and pensions secretary, who was on the government morning media round, later described London as “a great capital city that we have”, adding: “I think it’s a great asset to the UK. And I’m afraid I differ from the president on that.”Nigel Farage said Trump was right to say that sharia law “is an issue” in London, adding: “Trump has a point.”TheReform UK leader told LBC: “Never take what he [Trump] says literally, ever on anything. But always take everything he says seriously.”He added: “So is he right to say that sharia is an issue in London? Yes. Is it an overwhelming issue at this stage? No. Has the mayor of London directly linked himself to it? No.”Explore more on these topicsSadiq KhanDonald TrumpLondonPat McFaddenLabournewsShareReuse this content"

His chilling account of how Russia is using technology to change the face of war was the opposite of Donald Trump’s claim that Russia’s militarymay only be a paper tiger.He warned that Vladimir Putin, unchecked, would use drones to expand his war throughout Europe. “The facts are simple. Stopping this war now, and with it the global arms race, is cheaper than buildingunderground kindergartensor massive bunkers for critical infrastructure later,” he told the UN. “Stopping Putin now is cheaper than trying to protect every port and every ship from terrorists. Stopping Russia now is cheaper than wondering who will be forced to create a simple drone with a nuclear warhead.”Ten years ago, he said, “war looked different and no one could have imagined that cheap drones could create death zones stretching for dozens of kilometres where nothing moves, no vehicles, no life. People used to imagine that only after a nuclear strike. Now it is drone reality, and without AI yet.”Referring to the recent wave ofRussian disruption across Europe, including adrone incursion into Poland, he said: “Putin was intent on driving the war forward, wider and deeper … to continue this war by expanding it.”He said he had warnedEuropebefore about Russia’s intentions “and now Russian drones are flying across Europe”. No one could be immune to the spread of war, he said, adding: “We are living through the most destructive arms race in human history.”Zelenskyy gave no overall evaluation of the war inUkrainenor did he refer directly to Trump’s surprise claim it would be possible for Ukraine to recapture all the lands that it had lost to Russia since 2022, saying simply he had had a good meeting on Tuesday with the US president.He said in the modern world “only friends and weapons” protected countries, and not international law or UN resolutions. But he said every country faced a choice between peace or helpingRussiaby continuing to trade with Moscow. Those that continued to fund the war consigned prisoners of war, abducted children and hostages to longer periods of captivity, he said.Map of Russian advances in UkraineZelenskyy also said that Europe could not afford to lose neighbouring Moldova toRussian influence. The country’s prime minister, Dorin Recean, on Wednesday claimed Russia was spending hundreds of millions of euros to “take power” ina pivotal parliamentary electionthat could derail Moldova’s course toward the EU.Before Zelenskyy’s speech, Moscow had brushed off the shift in tone from Trump, including his claim Russia had been “fighting aimlessly for three and a half years”, a stark contrast to thered-carpet treatmenthe laid out for Putin at a summit in Alaska last month.The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, attributedthe commentsto the fact Trump had just met Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York. “Of course, President Trump heard Zelenskyy’s version of events. And apparently at this point, this version is the reason for the assessment we heard.”Peskov said the Russian army was making gains in Ukraine, albeit slowly. Putin “has repeatedly stated this – we are moving forward very carefully to minimise losses … These are very deliberate actions,” he claimed.Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president now better known for his outlandish rhetoric, wrote on Telegram that Zelenskyy had lured Trump into an “alternate reality” where Ukraine could win the war. But Medvedev added that he was confident Trump would soon change course.“I have no doubt, he’ll be back. He always comes back …. Most likely he’ll soon tell [Zelenskyy] to sign an act of capitulation,” Medvedev wrote.Russian military bloggers seized on Trump’s remarks, portraying them as a sign he was seeking to edge away from the war and create distance from a conflict he once vowed to end within days.“The US is trying to wash its hands so it won’t lose its face if Ukraine collapses,” wrote Dva Mayora, a Telegram channel with ties to the Russian defence ministry.On Tuesday Trumpgave an upbeat assessmentof Ukraine’s prospects in the war, claiming Russia was in big economic trouble.

In her account of the meeting, von der Leyen said: “By 2027, Europe will have turned the page on Russian fossil fuels for good.”Last week von der Leyen announced plans to phase out Russian liquified natural gas purchases by 2027, a year earlier than planned. The commission also announced plans to expand sanctions to 118 vessels in Russia’s shadow fleet, poorly maintained tankers that are used to transport Russian oil to foreign buyers evading western price restrictions.But the EU has not yet ended an exemption from buying Russian oil that was granted toHungaryand Slovakia in 2022. Both central European countries have rejected the plan to phase out Russian fossil fuels despite pressure from Trump, an ally of the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán.The EU needs unanimity to agree on sanctions, although measures to restrict trade can be approved by a majority. It remains unclear when and how the latest proposals will be agreed, with senior EU diplomats expected to discuss the plans in the coming days.Explore more on these topicsRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkraineDonald TrumpUS foreign policyVladimir PutinEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Jim Gavin, who managed Dublin’s Gaelic football team, will represent its centrist coalition partner, Fianna Fáil. Catherine Connolly, an outspoken pro-Palestinian voice, is backed by small leftwing opposition parties as well asSinn Féin, which declined to field its own candidate.The election on 24 October will end the 14-year tenure of Michael D Higgins, who has drawn praise and criticism for turning the largely symbolic post intoa platformfor global issues, notably with regard to Gaza.View image in fullscreenThe mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor was one of several political outsiders to express interest in running for the presidency.Photograph: Noam Galai/Getty Images for Cantor FitzgeraldSeveral prominent figures,including Michael Flatley, Bob Geldof and the anti-immigration mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor – who was endorsed by Elon Musk – had expressed interest in running butfailed to win the backingof four local councils or 20 legislators that was required to get on the ballot.Gareth Sheridan, a pharma tycoon, and Maria Steen, a social conservative activist, narrowly failed to reach the threshold. “I regret to say it was not enough and that time has now run out,” Steen said on Wednesday. The public’s “hunger for an alternative candidate” would now go unsatisfied, she said.Several commentators, including liberals opposed to Steen’s views, had expressed hope she would make it on to the ballot to give voters more choice.The presidency was once a sinecure for establishment grandees but Mary Robinson’s insurgent victory in 1990 ushered in an era of unpredictable campaigns focusing more on candidates’ personalities than party affiliations.A 14 September opinion poll taken before Sinn Féin endorsed Connolly gave her 17%, behind Gavin on 18%, and Humphreys on 22%.

Connolly, 68, has been criticised for meeting Bashar al-Assad supporters during a 2018 trip to Syria and for telling the BBC this week that Hamas was “part of the fabric” of the Palestinian people, a comment that unnerved Labour and the Social Democrats, which are part of the coalition backing her campaign.Gavin, 54, a political novice parachuted in after successful careers in sport, aviation and the military, has assailed social media companies for allowing what he said were “completely unacceptable” lies and misinformation about him and his family on their platforms. “I’m not going to stand for it and at a broader context society shouldn’t stand for it,” he said.Humphreys, 62, a Presbyterian from the border county of Monaghan, faced questions over her inability to speak Irish and her family’s historical links with the pro-union Orange Order in Northern Ireland. Humphreys has said she favours Irish unity and supporters said her Protestant heritage could help win over Northern Ireland’s unionists.Explore more on these topicsIrelandFine GaelSinn FéinFianna FailEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Born in San Francisco in 1907, Branyas moved to Catalonia in 1915 and survived two world wars, the Spanish civil war and the Covid pandemic, recovering from the virus aged 113.Why do the children of elderly patients stay away? Loneliness makes them get sicker and stay sicker for longer | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreEsteller and his colleagues drew on blood, saliva, urine and stool samples collected a year before Branyas’s death to build a detailed picture of her biology. The tests delved into her genetics and the extent to which different genes were switched on and off; the varieties and levels of proteins in her blood, the breakdown products from reactions in her body and the diversity of microbes in her gut.Among a trove of discoveries, they found that protective caps called telomeres on the ends of Branyas’s chromosomes were exceptionally short, a clear sign of old age in her cells. Her immune system also showed signs of old age, was prone to inflammation, and she had acquired mutations that lead to leukaemia.But Branyas was seemingly well protected. Telomeres shorten whenever cells divide, and hers were so short they may have protected her from cancer by limiting the amount that cells continued to divide, Esteller said.A close look at her DNA revealed gene variants that protected her heart and brain cells from disease and dementia. She had low levels of inflammation throughout her body, which reduced her risk of cancer and diabetes, and efficient cholesterol and fat metabolism. “These are all critical because they’re linked to diseases that are typical in older people and they kill you at the end,” Esteller said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her gut microbiome was also very young for her age with plenty of Bifidobacterium, which is also considered beneficial to health.Her long life was not all down to genetics, however. Branyas was not overweight, ate a lot of yoghurt, and did not smoke or drink. She had a good social life with friends and family nearby. All surely helped, Esteller said.He hopes the wealth of information will help scientists develop new treatments to keep people healthy in old age. “We can develop drugs to reproduce the effects of good genes,” he said. “Maria’s parents gave her very good genes, but we cannot choose our parents.”Prof João Pedro de Magalhães at the University of Birmingham, said: “These outliers in longevity could provide insights into how to age more gracefully. If we could figure out which specific genes are associated with extreme human longevity and healthy old age it could provide clues about mechanisms for ageing as well as drugable targets to develop interventions that allow everyone to live longer, healthier lives.”Explore more on these topicsAgeingHealthSpainOlder peopleEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The alt-pop star explains why she’s still so fired upWed 24 Sep 2025 10.01 EDTShareIt’s 11 years since Sarah McLachlan last released an album of original songs. The break had worried her. “What do I have to say at this point in my life?” she says. “I’m a 57-year-old white woman of privilege. Does anybody want to hear from me?”Looking tanned and relaxed on an early morning video call from Vancouver Island, the Nova Scotia native admits she had “stayed busy”: she released a Christmas album (2016’s Wonderland) and worked as the principal fundraiser and founding board chair for her three namesake music schools, which provide lessons and education to at-risk youth. At the same time, she was a self-proclaimed dance mom raising two daughters; the second recently went off to college. But there was still “trepidation around being out of the game for so long”.McLachlan, though, has never been one for reticence. In the 1990s, with her otherworldly voice and knack for cathartic lyrics, the three-time Grammy winner was part of a galvanising movement of bold female singer-songwriters, from Alanis Morissette to Fiona Apple and Indigo Girls. Her US breakthrough, 1994’s Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, contained the haunting single Possession,based on obsessive fan lettersshe received.Several years later, she founded Lilith Fair, a revolutionary all-female artists festival that upended the music industry’s gendered power dynamics. At this week’s premiere of a documentary about the festival, Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery, McLachlan castigated the “insidious erosion of women’s rights, of trans and queer rights.” A subsidiary of Disney is distributing the documentary, and Disney’s temporary suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s talk show over his comments about Charlie Kirk prompted McLachlan to refuse to give a previously announced live performance “in solidarity in support of free speech”. On his return to TV this week (23 September), McLachlan was his musical guest.View image in fullscreenSarah McLachlan performs at the Lilith Fair at Shoreline Amphitheatre, California, in 1999.Photograph: Tim Mosenfelder/Getty ImagesMcLachlan’s honesty and willingness to subvert the status quo inspire intense devotion. Feist, Allison Russell and Muna’s Katie Gavin (who appears on Better Broken’s Reminds Me) are avowed fans. (You may not be aware of your own devotion: she sang the gutting When She Loved Me from Toy Story 2.) The rapturous response to a recent anniversary tour where she performed Fumbling Towards Ecstasy in full was “overwhelming”, she says. “I had no idea that many people had such an attachment to that record. Everybody I got to talk to about it was like, ‘Oh my God – this record got me through my first year of university.’”In recent years, McLachlan started trying to work out her next musical steps. She scrapped a bunch of songs, but found her direction with Rise, a song about embracing community when facing political headwinds. She wrote One in a Long Line, a steely response to the erosion of women’s rights and the overturning of Roe v Wade. “That song is about being mad,” she says with a laugh. “And upset, and going, ‘What the fuck is going on?’ I’ve never been overtly political. But I feel like this is a time where I have a platform, and whether I alienate fans or not, I feel like I need to make a stand.”Sarah McLachlan: Remind Me (ft Katie Gavin) – videoThe song acknowledges the generations of women who “foughtsohard to put [things] into place so that we would have agency over our own bodies,” she says. “To see that being taken away – and to see this idea that we should be back to being barefoot in the kitchen serving our men – is terrifying and enraging.” But she wanted to channel anger into action and interrogate the roots of these attitudes – “Is it just fear? Is it control?” – in order to “figure out a way forward” for future generations. To underscore this point, her two daughters add poignant backing vocals. “Because it is more about them than it is about me,” says McLachlan. “It’s about the generations coming forward and what we’re creating for them and what the world’s going to look like.”Growing up in Halifax, Nova Scotia, McLachlan first took ukulele lessons from a neighbour and later studied classical guitar and piano at a conservatory. “It was never the kind of music that I was that interested in, but it was a means to learn the instruments,” she says. “So I stuck with it.” She preferred listening to her mother’s folk records (Cat Stevens, Joan Baez, Simon and Garfunkel) and soon gravitated toward more progressive music. Genesis’s 1974 LP The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway was “a seminal record” – she gave one of her daughters the middle name Rael, the album’s main character – while Peter Gabriel, Cocteau Twins and Kate Bush became influential touchstones.At 19, after being spotted fronting her short-lived band the October Game, McLachlan signed with the Canadian indie label Nettwerk Records. They gave her “autonomy” and “full creative control” over her work. “Which is amazing,” she says. “I had no idea how lucky I was.”Missy Elliott, Lilith Fair 1998: a sensational burst of black fantasyRead moreThese halcyon days were short-lived. When she started promoting her music to radio in the 1990s, stations told McLachlan her single couldn’t be playlisted because another female artist had already been added that week, or that they couldn’t play two women back to back. Naturally, that didn’t apply to male artists. “It just seems so asinine to me,” she says. “As a music fan, I would just listen to music. I wouldn’t even think, ‘Is it a guy or a girl?’”Determined to prove the narrow-minded gatekeepers wrong, McLachlan booked a handful of all-female concerts in summer 1996. These shows sold out; buoyed by the enthusiasm, she started Lilith Fair the following year. The touring festival featured a rotating multi-stage lineup packed with mainstream and underground artists – the first year included Fiona Apple, Suzanne Vega, Tracy Chapman, Emmylou Harris and Sheryl Crow – and benefited local women’s charities.Promoters and radio employees were sceptical, she says, telling her: “People won’t come if you put more than two women on stage together.” But the tour became a phenomenon – and fringed with anti-abortion protesters and threats of violence. She held exhausting daily press conferences before each date, fielding questions that forced her to defend the tour’s very existence: “‘Why are you doing this? Why do you hate men?’ And I’m like, ‘What does celebrating women have to do with hating men?’” The constant pushback was “surprising and shocking to me at the beginning”, she says now. “And it wore me down a little bit, because I’m like, ‘You want to rip this thing apart, and you probably haven’t even come to see it.’”View image in fullscreen‘What does celebrating women have to do with hating men?’ … at Neil Young’s Annual Bridge Benefit in 1998.Photograph: Tim Mosenfelder/GettyLilith Fair raised McLachlan’s profile considerably. “I was playing to probably 3,000 people before I did Lilith,” she says. “And all of a sudden I was playing to 15, 18, 20,000. My audience exploded, and all the other [Lilith] artists’ audiences exploded as well.” By the end of the third and final Lilith Fair in 1999, McLachlan was itching to make new music, but found it increasingly difficult to balance overseeing the festival with songwriting. Musical trends had also shifted, with alt-rock earnestness replaced by regressive nu-metal and glossy pop.‘If men couldn’t have sex with me, they didn’t know what to do with me’: Alanis Morissette on addiction, midlife liberation and the predatory 90sRead moreShe enjoyed a massive UK hit in 2000 with dance remixes of Silence, a collaboration with her then-labelmates, the ambient electronic group Delerium, but over the next decade her commercial fortunes cooled. A 2010 Lilith Fair revival was marred by lacklustre crowds, negative headlines and financial woes.But today, momentum is on McLachlan’s side. Silence became a perennial summer dance staple. “A friend texted me last night from Burning Man,” she says. “It’s like, ‘Here’s your song with [DJ] John Summit.’ It’s had legs.”That long-awaited documentary on Lilith Fair alsopremieres this month. The film deftly illustrates the festival’s radical joy by juxtaposing new commentary from McLachlan and other artists (Jewel, Liz Phair, Indigo Girls, Paula Cole) with archival news, performance and interview clips. The artists come across as principled and full of integrity despite facing frankly horrifying sexism and misogyny; the artistic community that sprang up around Lilith Fair was clearly an oasis from this treatment.During filming, McLachlan re-read her diaries from this era and was struck by the juxtaposition of creative euphoria and operational stress: “So-and-so is not showing up. We’ve got a bomb threat.” She was gratified that the film itself captures the positivity of the tour. “I really got a sense of the joy, the exhilaration of meeting all these artists, of getting to perform with them, of getting to create bonds and friendships and this community that wasn’t competitive,” she says. “[It was] a safe space for us as artists, a safe space for the audience.”Many younger artists have called for the return of Lilith Fair, but McLachlan is ambivalent – and content to let those acts evolve her legacy. “It was all-encompassing, overwhelming,” she says. “And we did it – I already did it – so now I don’t want to do it again. Someone else can take the flame.”Better Broken is out now on Concord.

Yet Hollywood just couldn’t do her justicePeter BradshawThe smouldering star of Once Upon a Time in the West, 8½ and The Leopard had her best roles for Italian directorsClaudia Cardinale, star of The Leopard, dies aged 87Claudia Cardinale: a life in picturesWed 24 Sep 2025 08.03 EDTLast modified on Wed 24 Sep 2025 11.55 EDTShareClaudia Cardinale was part of the great wave of Italian movie stars whose postwar career took them fromEuropeto Hollywood; these included Sophia Loren, Gina Lollobrigida and Monica Vitti, who the American film industry prized not merely for their beauty but also for their mystery: an exotic feline allure and sense of toughness and survival, and even tragedy. But Cardinale perhaps had something her contemporaries didn’t: a kind of simplicity and frankness to go with the sensual allure. She often played opposite Alain Delon, whose own beauty complemented – almost merged with – hers.In Visconti’s early masterpiece Rocco and His Brothers from 1960, Cardinale played Ginetta, engaged to one of Rocco’s brothers from the uncouth south and her parents are openly hostile when their son-in-law’s entire family make their chaotic appearance. She was radiant in Luchino Visconti’sThe Leopardin 1963, as wealthy merchant’s daughter Angelica on whom Burt Lancaster’s Prince bestows his frank admiration even as she is engaged to his nephew Tancredi, played by Delon. In the famed final ball sequence, she plays her part by inviting Lancaster’s ageing lion to dance, and perhaps also to offer him an elegant symbolic exit from his own prestige.View image in fullscreen‘Ideal woman’ … in Fellini’s 8½.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyOther auteurs gave her significant roles – Alberto Cavalcanti gave her a part in his 1959 romantic comedy Venetian Honeymoon with Vittorio De Sica and Abel Gance cast her as Napoleon’s sister Pauline in Austerlitz in 1960 – but the most pivotal moment of Cardinale’s early career was to be cast byFederico Fellini in his cinephile meta comedy 8½. She played the up-and-coming screen star whom Marcello Mastroianni’s creatively blocked movie director impulsively decides is his ideal woman who must redeem his emotionally wrecked leading character – but who tells him this figure is incapable of real love. It is perhaps a subconscious, subtextual joke in 8½ that her surname riffs on cardinal importance, cardinal truth and religious authority. She also scored a hit in an authentic leading role in Girl With a Suitcase from 1961, directed by Valerio Zurlini, in which Cardinale played a young woman with the Verdi-esque name of Aida, who survives on the unreliable attentions of many different sorts of besotted men.Claudia Cardinale: a life in picturesRead moreHollywood didn’t entirely do Cardinale justice, making her an international star chiefly for being the sozzled, glamorous princess who owns the titular jewel in The Pink Panther, one of many cast-members destined to be upstaged by Peter Sellers’s Inspector Clouseau. She also lent her charm to many generic war pictures, her Italianate image being often considered appropriate to this kind of material, but the most important was Sergio Leone’s widescreen westernOnce Upon a Time in the Westfrom 1968, personifying the movie’s Italo-Hollywood fusion as former sex worker Jill, the tough woman with a past and the owner of a ranch that others want to destroy. Werner Herzog was later to give her the not entirely dissimilar part of brothel madame in his 1982 picture Fitzcarraldo.Back inItaly, she was paired with her country’s legends: playing opposite Franco Nero in the mafia drama The Day of the Owl in 1968, and with Alberto Sordi in the mail order bride comedy A Girl in Australia, in which Cardinale had a reformed tart-with-a-heart role. Another award-winning role was her portrayal of Benito Mussolini’s mistress in Claretta in 1984, directed by her partner Pasquale Squitieri.Cardinale was an amazing, vivid presence – and an icon of Italian and Hollywood cinema.This article was amended on 24 September 2025.

It was loosely inspired bya 2019 Cosompolitan articlethat describes an investigator known as the Savant as “an elite investigator who tracks angry men online”.In the trailer, her character warns: “Snipers, bombings, ambushes, we’re on the verge of serious violence.” She adds: “This guy isn’t just planning violence, he’s out to make a statement … innocent Americans are going to die”.While Apple did not elaborate on the decision, it comes soon after the killing of rightwing commentator Charlie Kirk at at Utah Valley University. Prosecutors have charged 22-year-old Tyler Robinson with the crime with text messages appearing to show the act was motivated by wanting to stop Kirk’s “hatred”.Chastain releaseda statementon Instagram in response, detailing “an unfortunate amount of violence” that has taken place during the making of the show, using examples such as Kirk’s killing, the kidnapping attempt on Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer and the January 6 riot.The actor explains that while she respects Apple, she is “not aligned” with the decision to postpone. “I’ve never shied away from difficult subjects, and while I wish this show wasn’t so relevant, unfortunately it is,” she writes. “The Savant is about the heroes who work every day to stop violence before it happens, and honoring their courage feels more urgent than ever. While I respect Apple’s decision to pause the release for now, I remain hopeful the show will reach audiences soon. Until then, I’m wishing safety and strength for everyone, and I’ll let you know if and when The Savant is released.”While reviews are embargoed, the Irish Independent’s Pat StaceycalledThe Savant “a thriller depicting the ugliness of white supremacist extremism in the United States”. The trailer also features threats of “a coordinated mass attack” and words on-screen mention that between 1994 and 2020, there were 893 extremist attacks in America.The Oscar-winning actor, who was named best actress for her role in The Eyes of Tammy Faye, called its timeliness “upsetting” in an interview withEmmy magazinebefore referring to “what just happened in Minnesota”, signalling toward the killing of Melissa Hortman.

But this excellent culture wars documentary tells the story of book-banning in red states such as Florida and Texas, where religious rightwingers are crusading to protect children from “obscene” books. Usually that means titles about LGBTQ+ issues or race, and books about girls getting their period aren’t safe either. In Tennessee, a school board banned Maus, the graphic novel memoir of the Holocaust by Art Spiegelman,for mouse nudity. The utter nonsense of it would be funny if it wasn’t so disturbing.The most recent purge began in 2021 witha list of 850 bookscirculated by Texas state representative Matt Krause (over 60% were books with LGBTQ+ themes). Rightwing Florida governor Ron DeSantis piled in, followed byMoms for Liberty, a rightwing parents’ rights group(don’t ask them about big dollar funders). Documentary maker Kim A Snyder and her editors cleverly work in footage of Nazi book burning and clips from classic movies and TV into their film.Out on the frontline, in school board meetings and public libraries, conservatives vent their outrage. In Granbury, Texas mum of nine Monica Brown believes her pastor should pick the books stocked in the library. Her gay son has other ideas. The heroes of the film are the librarians. Ordinarily, it would be tempting to insert a joke here. But these (mostly) women risk being fired from their jobs, and are routinely targeted with hateful vitriol. “Pornographer!” “Paedophile!” yells one man at a meeting, blood vessels popping. Another guy brings along a firearm: “I know where you live.” Incredibly principled and brave, the librarians talk about their vocation and standing up for the young people for whom libraries are a safe space where they can discover their identity in the pages of books. They really are superwomen.The Librarians is out on 26 September in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsLibrariesCensorshipreviewsShareReuse this content"

Predictably, the result is a bit of a mess, but there are redeeming features that make it much more watchable than many early reports might have suggested.For instance, the film contains arguably Bill Murray’s best semi-dramatic performance in years, on a par with his melancholy, haunted and yet still droll-dry turns in Rushmore and Lost in Translation. Here he plays Leftie, an east coast mobster, once a bit of a capo but now semi-retired ever since he handed over the reins of the family business to his son Johnnie (Michael Angelo Covino). Something explained only later has brought Leftie back into the killing people business, with assistance from nerdy murderer-in-training Lonnie (Pete Davidson). The two of them are heading up to Maine to find their mark, which necessitates a few practice kills along the way; these make Leftie sad but not so sad he would consider not killing.That’s obviously the gangster stuff; the family comedy element features an extended, blended brood that includes contractor Vincent (Ed Harris), his uptight, bougie second wife Sandy (Gabrielle Union) and their dorky teenage son DJ (Miles J Harvey). Their plans to enjoy New Year’s Eve are interrupted when Vincent’s previous family shows up unexpectedly. That includes his blowsy ex-wife Ruth (Jennifer Coolidge, also on excellent form), Vincent and Ruth’s grownup son Rocco (Lewis Pullman), and Rocco’s very pregnant girlfriend Marina (Emanuela Postacchini). Rocco and Marina have got mixed up in something bad and are on the run, and they have brought Ruth along with them for her own safety – after they managed to drug her with a festive cocktail of Percocet and sambuca. Soon, long submerged secrets bob to the surface where they explode like depressurised deep-sea creatures.The film requires abrupt tonal pivots to manoeuvre around the plot’s blackest bits, and director Dito Montiel and his team don’t quite manage to pull it off. The indifference to the suffering of innocent bystanders becomes an increasingly repugnant issue; it feels at times like one of Quentin Tarantino’s shonkier, uglier late-career efforts or, even worse, like a Tarantino-imitator trying to ape their hero’s swagger. But the cast’s enthusiasm, especially that of Coolidge and Murray who are willing to play the most loathsome of people, makes up for a lot.Riff Raff is available on Prime VideoExplore more on these topicsFilmCrime filmsThrillersDrama filmsComedy filmsBill MurrayEd HarrisreviewsShareReuse this content"

But the Third Reich did, in Mark Mazower’s judgment, “discredit antisemitism as a positive programme for decades to come”.It is an arresting turn of phrase that makes reckoning with the Holocaust after the second world war sound more like a trend in public policy than a moral imperative. But that is the point. Mazower, a professor of history at Columbia University, is talking about a particular manifestation of anti-Jewish sentiment that rose and fell in a relatively short time frame.The operative word, dissonant in the context of mass murder, is “positive”. People didn’t stop hating Jews after 1945, but they found there was an electoral penalty for boasting about it. The loud, proud style of antisemitism was banished from the mainstream.Mazower’s book contains many such distinctions – subtle twists of the lens that bring different shades of personal and ideological animus into focus. The underlying thesis is not controversial, at least not as historiography. Medieval massacres, Tsarist pogroms, industrialised slaughter by Nazis, Soviet persecutions and terrorist attacks on Israel all belong to a single category to the extent that Jews are identified as the victims. But they are also functions of diverse economic, religious and political contexts that, from the historian’s perspective, defy being summed up by a single word.Before you even get to the task of comparing motives for prejudice there is the problem of defining the target. Judaism is ancient, but Jewishness as an identity and, by extension, a set of attributes to be vilified, has evolved. Many of its current secular expressions would have been scarcely comprehensible to devout religious communities in premodern Europe. And yet, centuries-old rituals of faith are a strong pillar of cultural association even for atheist Jews today. Such are the paradoxes that Mazower grapples with in order to bring some precision to the meaning of antisemitism.The story begins with the coinage of the word in late 19th-century Germany. The concept is embossed with intellectual and political fixations of that place and time – the emergence of nationalism as an organising principle for European states and the accompanying pseudoscience of racial difference and hierarchy.For Mazower it is important to distinguish this relatively recent coalescence of anti-Jewish feeling as a driver of political activism from previous generations of animosity. He is especially critical of the tendency to treat antisemitism as a phenomenon as old as Judaism itself – the plotting of 20th-century atrocities on a continuum of hatred that reaches back to biblical narratives of exile, and further still to slavery under the pharaohs. His point is not to deny the long list of regimes and societies that have mistreated Jewish populations, but to resist the fatalism that conflates modern political phenomena with scriptural and liturgical tales of suffering and persecution.It is possible to express fury at the deaths of innocent civilians in Gaza without tilting into old conspiracy theoriesThis becomes especially important, and inevitably controversial, when Mazower’s timeline reaches the creation of modern Israel. Differentiating between modes of hostility to Jews before 1948 was a challenge. It becomes spectacularly difficult once the scene shifts to the Middle East.In 1920, the place most Jews called home was somewhere in Europe. By 1950, it was the US. Now it is Israel, where a radical nationalist government presents itself as the embodiment and only legitimate political expression of Jewish interests worldwide. That is an extreme reconfiguration of the original Zionist project. It is not a view shared by many diaspora Jews, nor indeed by liberal Israelis.Mazower strives to be systematic in setting out legitimate reasons for political opposition to the actions of the Israeli state and identifying the place where a certain ferocity of condemnation shades into antisemitism. It is possible to express fury at the deaths of civilians in Gaza without tilting into old conspiracy theories about Jews as a uniquely bloodthirsty global power elite. It is possible to demand justice for Palestinians without insisting on the annihilation of Israel.Crowds of Israelis who protest against Benjamin Netanyahu’s government manage it all the time. Plainly they aren’t all antisemites willing destruction on themselves and their country. That doesn’t mean the charge isn’t levelled against them by fanatical ultra-Zionists, who themselves sometimes aren’t even Jewish. There is a disturbing trend for white supremacists and Christian fundamentalists to adopt extreme pro-Israel stances because they see Gaza as the frontline in a civilisational struggle against Islam.As Mazower engages with these present-day arguments, his book takes less nuanced, more polemical and US-centric turns. His partisanship for the progressive side in a culture war being waged against US universities by Donald Trump’s administration is understandable, but it comes at a cost in relevance to readers in European countries, where the balance of political forces and arguments is different.But it surely asks too much that a book on this subject, at this inflection point in history, might illuminate all angles equally. For Mazower to provide any respite of clarity on a topic befogged in rage and confusion is achievement enough.On Antisemitism: A Word in History by Mark Mazower is published by Allen Lane (£25).

Asher Baum, anxious and hypochondriac, with two ex-wives, a handsome home in Connecticut and a pied-à-terre in Manhattan, finds himself having cocktails in Bemelmans Bar with an attractive young woman. Whatever shocks you might expect from this novel, the shock of the new isn’t one of them.Reading What’s With Baum? is an eerie, almost unearthly experience, like being taken to some secret Narnia part of New York where a new Neil Simon play is about to open, or a record store where you can check out a Burt Bacharach LP in the listening booth, or a TV studio where you can watch a live taping of the Dick Cavett Show, with Robert Wagner, Rex Reed and Gore Vidal. Allen’s mannerisms, his themes, his comedy – and there are some very good gags here – are just the same as they ever were. In fact, this novel is more fluent, more plausible on its own terms, than any of his recent movies – though it finally collapses into perfunctory and unresolved farcical silliness in a very familiar way.So: will Allen use the more confessional interior possibilities of the novel to address some of the controversy about him personally, such as the 1992 allegation of sexual assault made by his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow? Will he investigate the culture wars, which in his case flared up recently with a visit to theMoscow film festival? The answer is no, although it seems at first as if he might do all these things – as if, in fact, they are the whole point of his story.Asher Baum has recently given an interview promoting his latest book to a young Japanese-American journalist called Cindy Tanaka (or as Baum distractedly says: “Cindy Mindy Woo – the Chinese one whatever her name was”), on whose shoulders he afterwards placed his hands and to whom he gave a deeply misjudged and inappropriate kiss. Now Baum’s agent is on the phone warning him that the interviewer is outraged, that the piece is going to be a #MeToo takedown, and that Baum’s career – moribund in any case – is now finished.This novel is more fluent, more plausible on its own terms, than any of his recent moviesThe reader may be on tenterhooks to find out how Baum’s shruggingly ironic, nervily sardonic worldview is going to hold up in the middle of this imminent political storm – and, by that token, what it is like to be Woody Allen. But the storm never arrives. Cindy Tanaka never appears in her own person in the story, which effectively finishes before the article comes out.The point is rather to show Baum’s general comic unravelling, and the surfacing of all his neuroses. Like Herzog’s compulsive letter writing in Saul Bellow’s novel of the same name, Baum starts openly talking to himself, a jabbering dialogue of self-confrontation and self-exculpation. Subjects include his more successful businessman brother (whom he suspects of having had a fling with his third wife) and an intellectual mentor who, to Baum’s consternation, intends to abandon the life of the mind to play tambourine in a New Orleans jazz band called the White Chocolate Dandies.But most importantly there is Baum’s wife, Connie, and her insufferable son – and Baum’s stepson – Thane. Here is where the novel comes to life. As a kid, when Connie and Baum were first dating, Thane was an appalling brat. Now, while Baum’s career flounders, with nasty reviews and tanking sales, Thane suddenly becomes a literary superstar with a smash-hit novel called The Bevelled Heart. It’s a title that annoys the hell out of Baum, eaten up as he is with envious rage, having apparently become Salieri to this appalling young Mozart.There are plenty of nice lines along the way. Baum despises animals for being “failed humans”. He says the sexual signal “goes round and round endlessly, like radar” and that guilt is that “powerful enveloping element as prevalent as oxygen and perhaps just as necessary”. Poor Baum just has to keep working, like Sisyphus: “Does anyone give a damn that I’m pushing a rock up a hill? And if I ever get it up there, then what the hell have I got? A rock on a hill.” Baum, and his creator, are still pushing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Wayward son of the underworld Zagreus’s repeated attempts to abscond from his purgatorial prison offered catharsis at a time when none of us could leave our homes. It did no harm that it was genuinely, unapologetically sexy: all of artist Jen Zee’s character designs had abs hewn from Olympian rock, and just about everyone addressed you as if they’d seen you from across the bar and really dug your vibe. Winning the favour of these absurdly attractive Greek gods was the key to finally getting above ground. It was – apologies – a hell of an escape.And a hell of an act to follow, too. But in Hades II, composer Darren Korb delivers a thunderously dramatic score for the closing stages of your Olympian ascent that reaches alevel of operatic grandeurto trump anything in the original game. Zee’s new character illustrations (including onereturning favouritein a leopardskin posing pouch) are, if anything, likely to inspire even more aggressively thirsty fanart and fanfic. And writer Greg Kasavin’s wonderful script is wittier, wiser and flirtier than ever.Zagreus has absconded for the sequel: this time you’re his sister Melinoë, who finds herself at a crossroads.Not the motel, but the woodland clearing she calls home, alongside a clutch of spectral Shades and mentor Hecate. It might be gloomy and damp, but unlike Zag, she’s not looking to get away: she ventures out to fight each night because the Titan of Time, Chronos, is up to no good. Yes, in a wry subversion of what we were all doing five years ago, Supergiant is now literally inviting us to kill Time. It’s a battle on two fronts, and at two extremes: deep beneath the surface, and at the peak of Mount Olympus.View image in fullscreenToil and trouble … Hades II.Photograph: Supergiant GamesYou probably won’t even beat Hecate on your first attempt – a fight against your “headmistress” is only the first test of your combat skills. But therein lies the appeal of run-based games such as Hades II. Each night represents a chance to improve, to hone your (witch)craft. There are lessons to be learned in failure, but on each run you’ll makesomemeasure of progress. It leans fully into its occult theme: you’ll forage ingredients to drop into the cauldron between runs, and your spells and incantations improve your chances of survival.It draws inspiration, too, fromanother pandemic favourite. Animals crossing your path can sniff out resourcesandhelp in battle. Pale raven Raki pecks at rocks and foes alike, while faithful hound Hecuba can leave opponents stunned while digging up restorative snacks. I personally found it hard to look beyond wildcat Toula, who lunges, claws bared, at nearby opponents – when she can be bothered, at least. She also allows you to defy death once per run; with nine lives, she can afford to spare one.You’ll need the help of these unfamiliar familiars, and every bit of godly assistance besides, to conquer Chronos. Encounters are every bit as intense as you’d hope for, and it takes a minute to adjust to Melinoë’s enchanted arsenal. Fittingly, even as you wield her witch’s staff like a spear, combat feels closer to sorcery. A black coat that allows you to punch opponents into the ether doubles as a magic jetpack. The umbral flames have become my go-to, usually powered up by blacksmithHephaestus. As difficult as Hades II gets, you have more ways than ever to weight the dice in your favour. Conversely, you can make Olympus’s slopes even steeper: nightmarish boss-fight variants, for instance, demand mastery of the game’s most deliciously evil risk-reward mechanic.One of the joys of Hades II is getting caught up in the internecine discord amongthe dysfunctional extended family. But it’s ultimately aboutresolvingconflict. Sure, not everyone has read the memo: Scylla, front woman of a pop-punk trio of Sirens, cheerfully sings aboutclawing out your eyes and drowning youin the dank depths ofOceanus. But even the likes of power-suited Chaos and grumpy Nemesis (so affronted by you effectively doing her job that she’ll sporadically show up to challenge you to a contest, before barricading a potential exit) can be won over with a gift of nectar – or ambrosia. The game’s ending, too, makes it abundantly clear that any fight against forces of oppression requires us all to play a part, no matter how small; that whether you go low or high, resistance requires strength that can only come from solidarity.Explore more on these topicsGamesAdventure gamesAction gamesPCNintendo SwitchNintendo Switch 2reviewsShareReuse this content"

It started out as essentially a house party: a gathering of 27 people in the living room of Atari designer Chris Crawford. By the mid-90s it had left Chris’s house and grown to more than 4,000 attenders, and in 2005 found a permanent home in San Francisco’s Moscone Center. These days, about 30,000 game development professionals of all kinds attend every year. The online GDC Vaultis a precious troveof game development history and useful advice for any gaming discipline.GDC has developed a bit of an image problem in recent years, however, as we havereportedbefore. It’s prohibitively expensive for developers: a conference pass is more than $1,500, and travel and accommodation in one of the world’s most expensive cities quickly multiplies the total cost to anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000 (even for a hotel room with approximately the dimensions and safety of a phone booth).On top of that, since Trump was re-elected president, a large percentage of the global video game development community is reluctant to visit the US. And the vibe of the event has been somewhat soured by the sudden withdrawal of funding from the entire games industry, alongside the threats to developers’ livelihoods from AI and ever-present layoffs. If nobody is funding games, what’s the point of travelling for days and spending thousands to attend some meetings?As Jon Ingold, founder of UK studio Inkle, puts it: “GDC as an industry brokerage doesn’t make sense when there’s no money, no hiring, and the US is a hostile place to be … I fear whatever they do instead is too little too late; the executive club don’t leave much behind when they move out.”Perhaps this is why the event has decided to rebrand. On Monday night it was announced that Game Developers Conference is now GDC: Festival of Gaming. Avision presentationpromises “a full week of opportunity” in “a space where the full B2B games ecosystem connects”. It is quite hard to discern from this presentation what will actually be changing, but the key takeaways seem to be that getting a pass will be simpler, and events will now be all over the city rather than just at its Moscone conference centre.View image in fullscreenCalifornia calling … inside the GDC: Festival of Gaming.Unfortunately this rebrand does not address the concerns that developers have been expressing for years: namely, that access isn’t good enough, and that San Francisco (and perhaps, at this point, the US more broadly) is a terrible place for a global games conference. “Despite clear Covid-era evidence that GDC could be digitally accessible, and there being no reason but [organiser] Informa’s bottom line for the event being so expensive, GDC remains offline-only and the ticket prices obscene,” says independent game developer and consultant Rami Ismail, who has long been vocal about GDC’s problems on behalf of the global developer community. “Many developers around the world spend thousands to have their visas rejected after months or even years of wait. Even if they get the visa, the US has never been a safe place to visit, in terms of weapons, crime and health costs. [And] the Trump administrations’ institution of alt-right populism has made it unacceptably dangerous to even enter the country for most.”This statement is not overblown. Stories about visitors to the US being refused entry to the country anddeportedor – much worse – detained by Ice have been everywhere since Trump’s re-election. People aretravelling with burner phonesand scrubbing their social media. Anecdotally, many European developers and journalists, myself included, are reluctant to travel to the US under the current administration. For people coming from Arabic or South American countries, the concerns are significantly greater.I think most of the global game development workforce would agree that the US doesn’t make sense as a hub for the industry any more. San Francisco used to be one of the world’s centres of game development, and it still is home to some top-class companies and studios, but I can’t be the only one who feels that the city has been hollowed out by Silicon Valley types and no longer has the creative atmosphere that it did.There’s an easy alternative: Canada’s generous tax breaks have made it a very attractive place to develop games, and its current government is not actively hostile to foreigners. Local game developer gatherings exist in most countries, from Brighton’s Develop in the UK toGamesConnect in Australia. Gamescom now takes place in Cologne, Singapore and Brazil, with growing developer events alongside the public-facing ones. There’s nothing that the GDC organisers can do about the Trump administration, but if it wants to retain its position as a professional gaming nexus, it’s going to take more than a rebrand to make the case.What to playUncomfortably funny … Consume Me.Photograph: Jenny Jiao HsiaVideo game season is ramping up and there’s plenty to choose from: Supergiant’s painfully stylish mythological action game Hades II is just out of early access, and it’s excellent. Horror reboot Silent Hill f is also delighting (most) critics.I am playingConsume Me,developer Jenny Jiao Hsia’s uncomfortably funny game about surviving high school at the height of 2000s diet culture. As you go about Jenny’s relatable teenage life – involving absurd mini-games about trying to concentrate in class and walking the dog – you’re also having painfully awkward conversations with your parents about your weight, trying to Tetris foodstuffs on to your plate and waking up with food anxiety.This will be an uncomfortable topic for many people; it brings back depressing memories about the disturbing female body standards of the 2000s, and it may feel difficult to enjoy if you’ve ever struggled with disordered eating (or known someone who has). But these things are handled with humour, compassion and enough satirical bite (sorry) to make the discomfort worthwhile.Available on:PCEstimated playtime:five hoursskip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Two of my favourites include: “Don’t hesitate; when the time comes, just act” (Wolf O’Donnell, Star Fox Assault) and “A stubborn enough person can survive just about anything; rage is a hell of an anaesthetic” (Zaeed Massani, Mass Effect 2).Which video game words of wisdomhave struck a chord with you?”This is perhaps an unpopular opinion, but I believe that video games are usually profound by accident. Many of the stickiest quotes from games arise from some quirk of translation or voice acting (“I used to be an adventurer … but then I took an arrow to the knee”, “All your base are belong to us”, “Jill, the master of unlocking”). They’re often memorable for their absurdity rather than their deep meaning.That said, the phrase “It’s dangerous to go alone – take this” from the original Legend of Zelda has somehow made its way into my avoidant heart as genuine words of warmth, and “The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world” from Half-Life 2 has stuck with me.This is a good one to open up to the readership: do you have a video game quote that actually means something to you?If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter, including your favourite game quotes – hit reply or email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Director Emily Burns puts these strongmen in slick modern-day suits to hammer it home and the parallel becomes all the clearer in Frankie Bradshaw’s set which resembles a political battlefield of glass, chrome and parliamentary green. But the production also lays bare how puritanical morality and religion are weaponised by politicians in ways that seems utterly applicable to the machinations of the right wing today.An opening screen montage designed by Zakk Hein includes leaders whose reigns have been rocked by sex scandals (such as Bill Clinton and Donald Trump) as well as images of Jeffrey Epstein and Prince Andrew. What is ingenious, and counterintuitive, is that the villainous Angelo (Tom Mothersdale) is still made human. Outwardly he has an accountant’s dead-eyed way, following his morality laws to the letter by sentencing Claudio (Oli Higginson) on a technicality: he is waiting for dowry matters to be resolved when he is caught in flagrante with his wife-to-be, Juliet (Miya James). But when Angelo proposes to Claudio’s sister, Isabella (Isis Hainsworth), that he spare her brother’s life in exchange for her virginity – effectively blackmailing her for sex – he is shown to be tormented by his desire. You are repelled by his bald hypocrisy but understand it arises from weakness.View image in fullscreenDoubt cast … Isis Hainsworth and Adam James.Photograph: Helen Murray/c/o RSCWhat also seems so modern in the production is the doubt cast on women’s testimonies. “Who will believe thee?” Angelo says, when she threatens him with exposure, knowing the world will take his word over hers. Recent plays such asRed Like FruitandPrima Facieillustrate this fact, and it is truly horrifying that Angelo’s words ring so true today.This razor-sharp production has crisp, clear direction. A major high-wire edit is made by Burns who cuts the entire subplot involving Elbow, Mistress Overdone and co. It becomes a solemn play, with no distraction or light relief from the central storyline, but that works in its favour, with tension and dread turned up and up. Single notes of music (composed by Asaf Zohar) recur and spotlights heighten them further (lighting design by Joshua Pharo), along with unexpected use of Elvis Presley’s Can’t Help Falling in Love to accompany the vital bedroom swap between Isabella and Mariana (Emily Benjamin). The sex is made explicit and surprising in its power games.Even in spite of the excision of the more comic scenes, the production manages to wring out humour from certain lines spoken by these men, for their hypocrisies: Angelo’s shame at the end is both terrible and ridiculous as he tries to hide himself under his jacket like a naughty schoolboy, while Lucio (Douggie McMeekin)’s attention-seeking interruptions – and lies – during Duke Vincentio’s returning speech are laughable.Each performer brings fullness to their part, with crystalline verse delivery. Every inflection of Adam James’s Duke resembles that of a power-playing politician. Hainsworth, as Isabella, begins as the wide-eyed novice nun – a kind of Christian Dorothy of Oz with her gingham dress and scrubbed-face sense of right and wrong – but reveals steel and anger to become a mighty force. Benjamin’s hard-faced Mariana is another highlight but it is Mothersdale who soars the highest in making Angelo both appalling and human.The women’s testimonies dotriumph over Angelo’s in the end albeit with the vital help of the Duke. This production navigates his queasy marriage proposal to Isabella, which usually carries the sense of yet more sexual coercion, with an open-endedness that is more satisfactory for our times – and possibility brings Isabella her much-earned liberation.AtRoyal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 25 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreRoyal Shakespeare CompanyMeasure for MeasurereviewsShareReuse this content"

As the band build up the driving reggae skank of Toots and the Maytals’ Funky Kingston, the Jamaican capital awakens. A workman’s hammer and a cleaner’s brush help tap out the tune, the stage bustles with life and in one comic vignette a banana is brandished like a gun.Later in the show, a tamarind-switch punishment will provide a more brutal percussion and real pistols will be drawn – one in each hand, as in theiconic posterfor the 1972movie. Part of the phenomenal achievement of this musical adaptation is how the story is propelled from sun-kissed comedy to elegiac tragedy with the same front-footed energy as that opener, one of several reggae standards bolstering the film’s genre-defining soundtrack featuring Jimmy Cliff, the Melodians and Desmond Dekker.Suzan-Lori Parks’ book is lighter on patois but otherwise faithful to the screenplay, co-written by the film’s director Perry Henzell and Trevor Rhone. There are new songs, too, by Parks. If you love the movie but are allergic to musical theatre, fear not – they’re sweet and dandy. One of them, Hero Don’t Never Die, augments the irresistible film-within-the-film in which the characters watch Franco Nero’s Django lay waste to his opponents. Henzell’s film itself is a spaghetti western at heart, with the arrival of an outsider, “country boy” Ivan, in a violent town controlled by crooked enforcers, a tyrannical preacher and a powerful businessman (cynical music mogul Hilton).View image in fullscreenOnly aces in this deck … The Harder They Come.Photograph: Danny KaanBut Matthew Xia’s production also draws out the film’s galvanising spirit of protest, justice and power-to-the-people kinship, reinforcing just how Ivan could grow from wannabe reggae star to criminal to folk hero modelled on the real-life outlawRhyging. It’s a personal journey of self-mythology and self-determination, unfolding in the newly independent Jamaica.There are only aces in this deck. The cast are uniformly excellent, Simon Kenny has concocted a towering, ramshackle set, costume designer Jessica Cabassa has a sharp eye for unadorned spiritual and natty secular stylings while musical director Ashton Moore’s eight-piece band is as precise as Shelley Maxwell’s stunning choreography. Maxwell brings testifying church ladies across the stage in a parade but also creates blissful, hip-circling, high-stepping party scenes incorporating dance moves like whining and the bogle.View image in fullscreenScorching … Jason Pennycooke as the Preacher and cast in The Harder They Come.Photograph: Danny KaanIn the film, music is a constant backdrop and often used in a naturalistic fashion to suit the freewheeling tone rather than to power a set piece. This stage version does both and there is a scorching sequence in which the preacher’s congregation shed their robes for an unholy dancehall grind enacting their fantasies, complete with throbbing bass.Shelley Maxwell: the soul-stirring master mover who makes superheroes danceRead moreTime after time, lyrics deepen characterisation or plot: the play on words in Hitting With Music reflects Hilton’s aggressive campaign for chart-toppers, Pressure Drop serves not as breezy balm but doom-laden prophecy of Ivan’s fate while Rebel in Me comes with projections of lush Jamaican countryside on a shantytown’s makeshift bedsheet screen.The title song is robust enough to withstand several renditions, bringing out its grit and joy, performed by Natey Jones who returns to the role of Ivan after a different 2023 production at New York’s Public theater. Madeline Charlemagne’s devout Elsa, more defiant than in the film, is given a tender love song for Ivan, “a hymn of him”, by Parks. Jason Pennycooke (Preacher), Thomas Vernal (Hilton) and Danny Bailey (as hustling José) all manage to wring humour and menace from their roles. The spectacular result is every bit a match for the movie.AtTheatre Royal Stratford East, London, until 25 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreReggaeSuzan-Lori ParksMatthew XiaJimmy CliffTheatre Royal Stratford EastreviewsShareReuse this content"

A black hole could also be the gap that has opened up in the ceiling of a windowless A&E department, where a drip becomes a torrent, a metaphor for a crumblingNHS. And a “black hole of greed” is what playwright Uma Nada-Rajah sees in a system in which profit frequently comes before health.View image in fullscreenOperating theatre … Helen Logan in Black Hole Sign.Photograph: Mihaela BodlovicAs a staff nurse who works in critical care, Nada-Rajah writes with authority. All her characters, whether it is the recovering alcoholic with hours to live (Beruce Khan), the self-harming young woman who claims to have had a fall (Betty Valencia), the delirious octogenarian who thinks she is at a 1970s disco (Ann Louise Ross) or the man with a spike in his buttocks (Martin Docherty), have the ring of messy truth.So too does the playwright’s black humour. There are a lot of attempts at care in this overstretched ward but no room to be sentimental. This is where human bodies end up, with all their frailty, pain and incontinence, and it takes pragmatism to deal with them.That creates many laughs in a play that unfolds like a Brechtian parable of cause and effect: the more pressure bearing down on the nurses the more inevitably something will go fatally wrong. The senior charge nurse Crea (Helen Logan), her over-committed acolyte Ani (Dani Heron) and their clueless student Lina (Valencia again) are an accident waiting to happen.It is a shaming message, in a production fluidly staged by Gareth Nicholls for the Tron and Edinburgh’s Traverse. If its imaginative collision of pathos, comedy, polemic and drug-induced dream sequence creates an uneven pace and some bumpy shifts in tone, it is also a clear-eyed plea for cash as well as compassion.AtTron theatre, Glasgow, until 4 October.

Was he the man who brought jazz to British folk as a founder of Pentangle, as a collaborator with John Martyn, with Nick Drake, with June Tabor, the Incredible String Band and more? Was he the bringer of class to the mainstream, recording with Cliff Richard, Johnny HatesJazz, Rod Stewart, T-Rex and others? Was he the elder adding gravitas to the recordings of younger pop experimentalists and formalists: ABC, Everything But the Girl, Graham Coxon, the The, David Sylvian, Kate Bush and Talk Talk?Danny Thompson was all of those things because he was always Danny Thompson. Artists worked with him not so they could have someone hold down a root note in 4/4 on an electric bass; they hired him to be Danny Thompson. And Danny Thompson was extraordinary: a man who played the upright double bass as if it were a lead instrument, who may have been an accompanist but who was never a sideman. Whoever he played with and whatever he was playing, he sounded like himself.Thompson, who has died at the age of 86, was a bass player from the beginning. He made his first bass from a tea chest when he was 13, using stolen piano wire for strings and fitting a hinged neck so he could fold it to catch the bus. By 16 he was playing in Soho clubs, and after his two years’ national service he went on tour playing electric bass for Roy Orbison – the only time he ever played electric bass.Although his first recording was with Alexis Korner’s Blues Incorporated, on the album Red Hot from Alex in 1964, unlike so many young musicians of the British blues boom he was no purist: playing was his job. He loved both jazz and folk, and Soho in the mid-60s gave him an ideal chance to straddle the two scenes. His freewheeling, melodic, propulsive style was an accident: he simply didn’t have an ear for root notes, so his fingers went where his ears led him.Pentangle – Hunting Song (in concert, 1971)With Pentangle, which he founded with Jacqui McShee, John Renbourn, Bert Jansch and Terry Cox, he helped revolutionise British folk music. If Folk, Blues & Beyond, the 1965 album by Davy Graham on which Thompson played, had shown that folk’s limits could be pushed, Pentangle exploded them: a group of virtuosos fascinated by the traditional repertoire but with no care for blind respect of tradition.Folk purists condemned Pentangle – and their contemporaries Fairport Convention – for what they perceived as a bastardisation of the songs preserved by Cecil Sharp, Francis Child and the other folk song collectors of the Victorian and Edwardian eras. But what Pentangle and Fairport did with folk songs was revolutionary: they returned them to their original state of being ever-evolving. And by crossing folk with jazz and with psychedelia and with blues, Pentangle provided a version for their own times, and one that still sounds remarkable today.View image in fullscreenPentangle’s Danny Thompson, Bert Jansch, Terry Cox, Jacqui McShee and John RenbournPhotograph: Brian Shuel/RedfernsDuring the Pentangle years, Thompson became known as what he would later call “a bit of a raver”. It didn’t stop him becoming a hugely productive and in-demand session player, especially with John Martyn, though the fact of his closeness with Martyn reflected the raving. The two of them formed what the writer Mark Cooper called “a notorious double act as they slurred their way between sentimental tenderness and barely camouflaged rage”.By 1976, Thompson was telling Karl Dallas in Melody Maker that the phone wasn’t ringing as much as it used to. “I’m thought of as a wild animal at the moment, but that’s my nature, innit? So they wanted to calm me down and become an introvert, which would have fazed everybody, I think, if they’d seen me walking around like an introvert.”John Martyn ft Danny Thompson – I don’t want to know about evil (Transatlantic sessions, 1996)The following year, he confronted his alcoholism, but it took until the 80s for the phone to start ringing again – it was Donovan who called first, but then the new generation started getting him in for sessions. He played on The Dreaming and Hounds of Love for Kate Bush. But they didn’t have to be high-end jobs: he played on Shelleyan Orphan’s debut album, Helleborine, because he was so tickled by the love for Nick Drake shown by the band.It wasn’t until 1987 that he released his first album under his own name: Whatever. In it you could hear the threads of Thompson’s musical life pulled together to his own design – melody lines from English folk played as if by a man from New Orleans. And while he played plenty of sessions, he was by now a name in his own right and his name started appearing alongside others on album covers – Richard Thompson, Eric Bibb.It was entirely fitting that the last record with his name on it was so true to character. First, it was plainly a job. Second, it reunited him with Pentangle’s Jacqui McShee. Third, it was not at all what one might have expected, even if it was completely true to his interests: Song of Joy for Christmas – An Album of Christmas Carols.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockFolk musicJazzcommentShareReuse this content"

He is Diné, which is what the Navajo call themselves; it means “the people” in the Navajo language. He had often told me about this pinnacle, a short walk from his family’s house, where he likes to sit, taking in the light playing across the red exposed bones of the earth.In the Navajo Nation – the largest Indigenous Native American reservation in the US – a third of residents live without running water. Meanwhile, up until recently, Washington County in Utah – an Anglo community just 80 miles away – consumed the most water per person per day in the US, at 300 gallons, and paid the least for it. In the Navajo Nation water use is about five to 10 gallons per person per day and yet the Diné pay the most for what they do get, and some rural families have to drive one or two hours to a water source.When you get there, you sit in line for sometimes two or three hours, and then it takes half an hour to fill the tank in the back of your truck, before driving all the way home again. All that fuel, all that lost time, the wear and tear on your vehicle, having to do that up to four times a week in the summer because you need extra water for your animals as well as for your house.Tim and his family told me what it was like to live dryIn 2023 I received a fellowship from the Center for Environmental Journalism at the University of Colorado in Boulder to study the history of water and Indigenous communities. During school breaks, I travelled to Washington County and the Navajo Nation to begin building relationships. And then from late 2023 and through to the following summer I made the photographs.Towards the end of the project we finally made it up to Tim’s pinnacle. I was behind him as he climbed up. I had a long lens on my camera, and he started shouting. At first it was just sounds, and then he said: “This is me shouting into the wind, for change, and it all falls on closed ears.” It was a playful but powerful moment.My projects are typically funded through grants – in this case the Center for Contemporary Documentation. This funding is central to my ability to slowly build knowledge and work in an analogue process. With time, I can build meaningful relationships that lead to characters who propel you through a story. Tim and his family were able to articulate a lot of the finer aspects of what it means to live dry.I was born in Taiwan and am half Taiwanese, but I grew up on a farm on Colorado’s eastern plains surrounded by a community that I did not resemble. In the Navajo Nation, for the first time, I felt as if I found my people – rural westerners that are brown, and there’s some kindredness in that. In our shared sense of dark and dry humour, I found an innate sense of belonging on Navajo land.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Elliot Ross/Miguel DeLeonElliot Ross’s CVBorn:1990, Taipei, TaiwanTrained:Savannah College of Art and Design, BFA PhotographyInfluences:“The New Topographics movement that included the photographers Robert Adams, Stephen Shore, Nick Nixon and Emmett Gowin.

And this is for one reason and one reason only: she isn’t an actor any more.The last time Watson appeared on film was in Greta Gerwig’s adaptation of Little Women six years ago. Since then, she has decided to lay low, largely because she considered the act of promoting her movies “soul-destroying”. And good for her; not just for refusing to strap herself to the machine, but also for slipping away so quietly that nobody had actually even noticed that she’d gone.This is a rare skill. The world is full of actors who hate acting so much that they long to leave the profession behind, but so few of them can simply fade into obscurity as elegantly as Watson. So I’ve decided to step in and help. If you’re an actor who wants to take an extended leave of absence, here are the rules that you should probably stick to.Daniel Day-Lewis says he ‘never intended to retire, really’Read moreRule one: don’t announce your departureEmma Watson’s approach is in stark contrast to that of Daniel Day-Lewis; a man who, despite being the greatest actor on earth, is somewhat prone to a flounce. After completing work on The Phantom Thread in 2017, Day-Lewis announced that he had retired from acting, putting out a statement that read: “Daniel Day-Lewis will no longer be working as an actor.” Except, well, he is, because his new film Anemone comes out in November. The benefit to announcing your retirement so dramatically is that now Anemone feels like a far bigger event than it otherwise would. The risk, however, is that nowDaniel Day-Lewislooks a bit silly.Rule two: do announce a breakOn paper,Tilda Swintondid something very similar to Day-Lewis earlier this year, by telling everyone that she had stopped making films. However, she added a very clever failsafe: she made it clear that her break would be temporary. Perhaps she’ll start acting again in the new year. Perhaps it’ll be later than that. It doesn’t really matter. By underlining that this is a pause rather than a full-stop, Swinton gets all the attention that Daniel Day-Lewis did, but won’t have to make such a public back-down.Rule three: get a lucrative side hustleArguably,Gwyneth Paltrowhas never been more famous than she is today. What makes this unusual is that, barring a few cameos on TV shows and in the MCU, the last time Paltrow acted in anger was in the 2015 Johnny Depp boondoggle Mortdecai. So why has she kept her fame? Because she managed to pivot into a glamorous businesswoman, as the founder and face of vaginal-scented candle brand Goop. In short, she no longer needs to act. This also means that people get excited when she does act. Part of the reason that this winter’s Marty Supreme is so hotly anticipated is because it represents Paltrow’s grand comeback.Rule four: drop out at the bottomAfter losing an Oscar (and then immediately leaving the ceremony) for his role in 2006’s Dreamgirls, Eddie Murphy hit an unfortunate spiral, making Norbit, Meet Dave, Imagine That and A Thousand Words. This run resulted in a Razzie for Worst Actor of the Decade, and a four-year break from movies. If you manage to drop out at the bottom, you can’t help but impress people upon your return. So it was with Murphy; 2019’s DolemiteIs My Name won him rave reviews as a dramatic actor. Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F reasserted his position as an action star and he almost single-handedly ran away with SNL’s 50th anniversary show.Rule five: make your comeback vehicle extremely knowingFor a while, it looked as if Cameron Diaz’s turn in the 2014 Annie remake would be her final acting credit. Like Emma Watson, she decided to simply slip out of Hollywood unannounced to enjoy her life away from the grind. Similarly, Jamie Foxx’s career also looked like it had come to an end, after a stroke in 2023 left him gravely ill. However, this year the pair of them reunited for a film called – what else? – Back in Action, theHeard Ya Missed Me, Well I’m Backof perfectly adequate Netflix action comedies. Well played.Rule six: actually retireBelieve it or not, but this does actually happen. People just stop making films forever, and seem entirely happy about it. After making The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen in 2003 (and griping to the press that he was “fed up with the idiots”), Sean Connery enjoyed 17 years of retirement before he died in 2020. Robert Redford’s last starring vehicle was The Old Man & The Gun, made seven years before his death. It has now been 15 years since Jack Nicholson last appeared on film, and it’s unlikely that it will happen again. Sometimes, like Emma Watson, the most dignified thing is to walk away for good.Explore more on these topicsFilmEmma WatsonDaniel Day-LewisGwyneth PaltrowCameron DiazTilda SwintonJamie FoxxfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He democratised the dancefloor, fearlessly blended genres and understood the power of personalityWed 24 Sep 2025 07.01 EDTLast modified on Wed 24 Sep 2025 07.02 EDTShareIf you are a fan of club culture, soul, Brit funk, acid house, all-dayers, the radio edit of Kraftwerk’s Autobahn, weekenders or Sinéad O’Connor then – whether you know it or not – you are part of the world shaped by Chris Hill,who died on 11 September after a short illness.Hill was an Essex-born, working-class DJ who loved Black music so much he made it his mission to bring it to the pubs, clubs, airwaves, pop charts and record shops of England by any means necessary. He started out in the 1960s trading blues records and landed a residency in 1967 playing jazz at The Orsett Cock in Essex; later came a soul residency at the Goldmine nightclub on Canvey Island, Essex, and from there to the Lacy Lady in Ilford, east London, and headlining the CaisterSoulWeekender in Norfolk.Along the way, he formed the Funk Mafia, a group of DJs including Greg Edwards, DJ Froggy, Jeff Young and a young Pete Tong, appeared on the pirate Radio Invicta 92.4 FM, and co-founded the Ensign label with Nigel Grainge, where he signed O’Connor, the Boomtown Rats, Eddy Grant and many more.‘There were pitched battles, fist fights’: how Britfunk overcame racism to reinvigorate UK popRead moreWhen I was a 15-year-old funkateer, Hill meant the world to me. His impeccable taste and understanding of music, fashion and audiences – all delivered in his broad Essex accent, with a missionary zeal and a flamboyant style – helped forge the template of the “cultural influencer” way before the architecture of influence-as-product was even a thing. He saw the club as a place of communion and community – diverse, multiracial, without prejudice or exclusion. He democratised the dancefloor, breaking the wall between dancers and onlookers opening hearts and minds by fearlessly blending genres.He was untouchable – he was to clubbing what jazz, funk and soul DJ Robbie Vincent was to radio. I was so committed to his gospel that one day I broke off from playing seven-a-side because rumour had it that Hilly lived near the pitches, so I went in search of what might be his home.I found my tribe, one formed in Hill’s image, at the club Tiffany’s in Purley: attired in leather pegged trousers and Pod shoes walking the gauntlet of taunting punks and skins. The perpetual soundtrack included Jingo by Cándido Camero, Night Cruiser by Eumir Deodato and Time by Light of the World, a group that Hill had signed and developed into the UK’s Earth, Wind & Fire. We once united at Bluebird Records in Paddington, west London, for a coach ride to join thousands of other kids from all around the country at the Caister Soul Weekender, where people of all backgrounds descended on an out-of-season Norfolk holiday camp for the day: the embodiment of one nation under a groove.View image in fullscreen‘One of the first British DJs that people would pay to see’ … Hill at an all-dayer in Brighton in 1979.Photograph: © Tony DearsleyThe kind of genre fluidity that Hill proselytised is now considered the norm, but he was the first. His residency at the Goldmine quickly became a southern mecca for soul pilgrims. In the mid-70s, it also became the centre of a swing revival, where kids would jive to Jimmie Lunceford and Count Basie, decked out in 40s clobber. Here, you could rub shoulders with a who’s who of the time, from Sade to Siouxsie Sioux. Then, at the Lacy Lady in the Ilford suburbs, he put on the Clash, the Damned and Subway Sect, while playing Fela Kuti and Krautrock alongside his beloved jazz funk and soul. (A little-known fact: the Clash’s Mick Jones was a revered dancer at Chris’s weekly soul session. After all, in the words of Andrew Weatherall: “The initial punk scene in London was a load of bored soul boys who liked dressing up.”Hill clearly understood the power of personality, making him one of the first British DJs that people would pay to see. He was from a theatrical background, with a lifelong passion for Shakespeare and could easily have taken that path. Uninterested in being cool, he doubled up as his own MC, urging the crowd to participate and, in so doing, continuing the lineage of a particularly British form of entertainer. I remember him playing Latin America by Cedar Walton to 2,000 kids at Caister at midnight on a Saturday: he told us to dance and we obeyed! That power also cultivated trends and dance fashions: he took the world-famous rowing-boat dance, normally associated with Oops Upside Your Head by the Gap Band, and popularised it, alongside Ring My Bell by Anita Ward.But Hill was less interested in advancing himself as a personality than he was using his platforms to evangelise and push forward the culture. While he never became a full-time radio jock, he broadcast frequently on Radio Invicta, the first specialist Black music pirate on the FM dial. As he put it: “The second you make it all about you … you’ve already lost. It’s about people – it always has been and it always will be.”When he got behind a record he loved, he could influence the charts – back when they were still a barometer of culture, not just sales: he supplied the energy behindJazzCarnival by Azymuth, British Hustle by Hi-Tension and Southern Freeez by Freeez. He fundamentally helped shape the UK’s broad taste in popular music – until the mid-80s, when the birth of acid house ushered in a new generation of DJs including Carl Cox, Paul Oakenfold and Danny Rampling. Hill’s approach was based on diversity and inclusion, preaching unity – something we would do well to remember today, alongside his memory.Thanks to Mark“Snowboy” Cotgrove for his help with some of these anecdotes and for flying the flag for Chris Hill until the end.Gilles Peterson is a BBC Radio 6 Music DJExplore more on these topicsMusicClub cultureSoulClubbingDance musicJazzcommentShareReuse this content"

Dragged through the mud, blunted by branches, clogged with clippings and exposed to some of the most wearing of environmental conditions – namely rain, sap and soil – you can’t help but feel the average spanner gets an easier ride than a pair of secateurs.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.And yet gardening tools are among the most cherished and expensive of maintenance equipment, with popular brands such asNiwakiandFelcocatering to a booming luxury market with embellished components such as leather and rattan handles, and blades forged in the mountains of Yamagata, Japan.An estimated 27 million people are now actively gardening in the UK, and households are spending more on gardening tools than ever. And as I wrote in my roundup ofthe best secateursthis year, such is the bond between gardener and trusty hand tool that they often become companionable, personally prized possessions. So what can you do to prolong the life of a treasured border spade, hedge trimmer or pair of beloved secateurs? Here are a few tried and tested tips from the hard-grafting experts, and some products that will make light work of a messy job.How to make your garden tools last longerCultivation toolsHaving worked and volunteered in numerous large-team gardens over the years, I’m always intrigued by the policies head gardeners employ for the preservation and storage of general-use gardening tools. While some are content with a quick brush down after use, others are positively draconian.Millie Souter, head gardener at the Plant Library in Hertfordshire, tells me she’s strict about maintenance. Tools such as border spades and trowels are washed and rinsed clean under a hose after every use, and each has a designated space marked out in the potting shed. “It just makes it a pleasure to be able to grab a tool that’s clean, ready to use, and you know where it is!” she says. For the clean-down, she recommends a reliably stiff brush, with good examples being Tinker and Fix’s garden tool brush and Charnwood’s bassine hand brush. For washing multiple tools in one go, you can half-fill a garden trug with water – such as a flexi tub – and, provided it’s free of soap, irrigate thirsty trees and shrubs with it once you’re finished cleaningView image in fullscreenGarden tool brush£6.95 at Tinker and FixView image in fullscreenCharnwood bassine hand brush£8.99 at B&QView image in fullscreenFlexi tub, 42l£16.99 at CrocusCutting toolsAny tool centred around a blade – or, most commonly in gardening, a pair of blades – requires a little additional attention. But while whole manuals have been written on the detailed maintenance of blades, the process really needn’t be comprehensive, as there are but two perils to prevent: bluntness and rust.In horticulture, the cleanliness and sharpness of a blade – whether a pair of secateurs, shears, a pruning knife or scythe – can greatly affect the work at hand: bruised blades bruise plants, just as dirty blades advance disease. For regular, day-to-day cutting-tool cleanups – particularly for secateurs and hand shears – removing grime is hugely important.A spray lubricating and cleaning oil, such as WD-40 or Oregon’s biodegradable MX14 cleaner, applied to all moving parts, crevices and corners (blades, nut, spring, etc), will break down the residue left by sappy plants, mulches and soil. Spray, allow to soak and then wipe away with a washable cloth such as a duster, or Minky’s more sustainable all-purpose bamboo cloth. (Or you could just rip up and repurpose old T-shirts, as I often do.)View image in fullscreenWD-40spray£8.49 at B&QView image in fullscreenOregon biodegradable MX-14 workshop liquid cleaner£7.78 at AmazonView image in fullscreenMinky bamboo all-purpose cleaning cloth, pack of nine£21.99 at Tesco£21.99 at AmazonFor further daily blade sprucing, Souter recommends Niwaki’s Mini Clean Mate, a pocketable sap and grime eraser that you run over the blades and nut after use. “It’s really good and really quick – you can just use it like a rubber to remove gunk.”View image in fullscreenNiwaki Mini Clean Mate£9 at Niwaki£9.99 at CrocusFor a deeper clean, many models of secateurs and shears can be taken apart fully, making them easier to then sharpen. Katy Merrington, head gardener at the Hepworth Wakefield, enjoys showing her group of garden volunteers how to dismantle and clean secateurs, loosening the nuts with a spanner or socket wrench and cleaning everything with a rough scourer or wire wool, before sharpening them.View image in fullscreen14-piece metric socket wrench set£12.74 at AmazonView image in fullscreenFairy steel wool scourers£1.79 at Joybuy£1.80 at Ocado“Sharpening tools is a funny thing that falls into the same category as barbecuing – for some reason, people think it’s a particularly manly job. Volunteers often suggest bringing their husbands in to do it, so I take a particular pride in teaching people how to do it themselves.” They do this at least once a year, Merrington explains, typically in winter, making use of time indoors. “There’s nothing worse than ending up with tools that just sit there unused because you haven’t bothered to sharpen and maintain them.”Merrington describes how they run the secateur blades along a sharpening stone, or whetstone, at the existing angle of the blade’s slant, by hand. “We then test the sharpness on a piece of paper or on plant material.” A small to medium whetstone works best for this, including Felco’s fancy diamond sharpener and Opinel’s 10cm sharpening stone. Niwaki offers a set of three stones, differing in grit coarseness, and camellia oil for a clean finish afterwards.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Felco’s 910 belt-looped holster has certainly kept mine from going missing over the years.View image in fullscreenFelco 910 leather holster£16.37 at AmazonElectric toolsThe No 1 rule with electric power tools, includinglawnmowersand hedge trimmers, is to store them in a dry environment, as dampness can lead not only to corrosion and short-circuiting but also to associated safety risks.So a leak in the shed or outdoor storage box, however small, is worth patching right away. As for cleaning and sharpening, electric tools can generally be treated similarly to petrol machines, says Matthew Walker of Upton and Walker Gardening, a garden maintenance and design company based in south-east London.Walker says he cleans his electric mower after every use, removing any debris. “I tip it up and clean out the underside with a hand tool, or sometimes a blower,” he tells me. As with all electric tools, it’s important to disengage the battery before any cleaning or maintenance. Most important for mowers, says Walker, is to keep the blade sharp, otherwise “it just tears the grass and it looks crap after a few cuts”. This can also lead to the blade becoming damaged. He uses Niwaki’s twin diamond file for this, taking out any nicks. “I probably replace the blade entirely once every season, too,” he says.But he recommends taking hedge trimmers to be resharpened professionally by a specialist. “You can do it at home, but it’s quite technical, so it can be better to send the machine off,” he says. After cleaning or sharpening his tools, Walker applies Stihl’s SuperClean lubricant spray, which gets rid of the sticky resins that can build up.View image in fullscreenNiwaki twin diamond file£24 at Niwaki£24 at BurfordView image in fullscreenStihl SuperClean spray£17.07 at AmazonExtrasWheelbarrowsScrape clean after use and don’t leave out over winter – find space in the shed or cover with a tarpaulin when not in use.GlovesA cold machine wash once a month will keep fabric-based gloves in good condition.Wooden-handled hand toolssuch as hoe, rakeor trowelA fine-grain sanding and a light coating with boiled linseed oil will help prevent the degradation of wooden handles.View image in fullscreenExtra fine metal and wood hand sanding sheets, five pack£5 at B&QView image in fullscreenBartoline boiled linseed oil£5.99 at My Motor WorldFor more, read the Filter’s guides tothe best secateursandthe best pressure washersMatt Collins is a garden, nature and travel writer, and head gardener at the Garden Museum in LondonExplore more on these topicsGardening adviceThe FilterGardensfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The result was unexpectedly sophisticated. The casting, featuring men and women of all ages and sizes, was a triumphant showcase for how beautifully the shapes worked on different bodies.“I feel very proud, not just of what I’ve done but of all the talented people who have done it with me,” said Silvia Fendi backstage. “I could talk for days about all the things I’ve seen, in this life in fashion.

This is a global Slow Food initiative to record and protect traditional and indigenous foods, from the black salt of Boke, Ethiopia, to the Tamworth pig, which I served from nose to tail as a main course at the banquet. Locatelli’s chosen ingredient was the bronte pistachio, which he showcased with the most luxurious tart. Here, I’ve adapted his recipe for a classic basil pesto to use up excess fennel fronds, and used pistachios instead of pine nuts, not only because they’re incredible in pesto but also as nod to that amazing tart.Fennel frond and bronte pistachio pesto (and an optional shaved fennel salad)Farmers’ market fennel often comes with an incredible plume of feathery fronds, but even supermarket fennel often has a few sprigs at the top of the bulb. They make the most wonderfully fragrant pesto, and if need be can be bulked out with some of the fennel stalk or other soft herbs (from stem to leaf) such as basil, parsley or coriander.Locatelli’s pesto recipe focuses on the use of a mortar and pestle, a tool I adore, but I’ve always found it hard to grind leaves to a paste, so I tend to use a blender instead. If you are using a mortar and pestle, start by crushing the garlic to a paste with a pinch of salt, then lightly crush the nuts, then grind in the fennel fronds a bit at a time, before mixing in the grated cheese and oil. Breaking from tradition, I’ve also included lemon at the end to lift the dish and help soften the fennel. The pesto is ready to use straight away, but I prefer to let it rest for a few hours, or even a day, to soften and meld together into a harmonious, glutamate-rich dressing. It can be used like regular pesto, simply tossed through pasta or gnocchi, or spooned over roast vegetables, as well as to marinate meat or to top salads.For the pesto (makes about 350g, or enough for about 6 servings)1 garlic clove, peeled50g shelled bronte pistachios, or another nut or seed, such as pumpkin seeds, walnuts or pine nuts125g fennel fronds and thin stalks(if need be, make up the weight with some other soft herbs such as parsley, coriander or basil, or even a slice or two of the bulb)Juice of ½ lemon, plus the finely grated zest if it’s organic and unwaxed25g pecorino, or parmesan, grated150ml extra-virgin olive oil1 pinch sea saltFor the salad2 fennel bulbsExtra-virgin olive oil, to tasteJuice of ½ lemon, plus the finely grated zest if it’s organic and unwaxedSalt and black pepperFennel frond and pistachio pesto, to taste (see above and method)Shaved pecorino, or parmesan, to tasteTo make the pesto, put the garlic, nuts, fennel, lemon juice and zest (if using), pecorino, oil and salt in a blender, and pulse to a coarse paste – you’ll probably need to stop the blender and scrape down the sides every now and then. Decant into a clean jar and store in the fridge for up to five days.To the fennel salad topped with fennel pesto, slice the fennel bulbs very thinly, ideally using a mandoline, then put in a large bowl. Drizzle over a little extra-virgin olive oil, then add the lemon juice and grated zest, if using, a pinch of sea salt and some freshly ground black pepper. Scatter over a platter, dot with pesto to taste and finish with pecorino shavings. The salad is lovely eaten immediately, but it holds up surprisingly well to waiting a while.Explore more on these topicsHerbs and spicesWaste notSauces and graviesFoodFood wasteVegetablesItalian food and drinkSaladfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the UK, with its distinct seasons, that weather influences mood, so pairing the right dish with the climate and season feels deeply nourishing, and goes far beyond mere sustenance. To me, pasta is the most versatile of food types and lends itself perfectly to such seasonal cooking: a walk through damp woodland, say, often makes me crave wild mushrooms, sauteed with garlic and herbs, then tossed with fettuccine, while, as the days shorten and the air cools, a slow-cooked game ragu with penne always hits the spot, as does a warming blast of ’nduja in a creamy sauce. And when indulgence calls, a rich walnut, egg and parmesan sauce is wickedly satisfying.Pappardelle with parmesan, creme fraiche and toasted walnuts (pictured top)You need to be hungry for this one, and I recommend eating it after you’ve done some form of exercise, so you feel as if you’ve earned it.

Put the creme fraiche, marjoram, a good pinch of ground black pepper, the grated parmesan and 20ml cold water in a nonstick saucepan and stir over a very low heat for five to eight minutes, until they melt into a smooth, oozy sauce; make sure the sauce doesn’t boil, otherwise it will split. Take off the heat.Melt the butter in a frying pan on a medium-low heat, then add the walnuts and saute, stirring, for two minutes, until lightly toasted. Tip on to a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain and cool, then roughly chop or pound into 5mm pieces.Loosen the fresh pasta bundles with your fingers, so they won’t stick together as they cook, then drop into the boiling water and cook for a minute to a minute and a half; if using dried pappardelle, cook for eight to 10 minutes, or according to the packet instructions, until al dente. Drain the pasta, saving two mugs of the cooking water.Off the heat, return the pasta back to the empty pot, add half a mug (about 120ml) of the reserved water and stir. Add the parmesan and creme fraiche sauce, using a spatula to scrape all of it out of the pan, then stir over a low-medium heat for about a minute, until the liquid reduces a bit and the sauce turns oozy; if the sauce seems a bit dry, add splashes of the reserved water to loosen it, and keep stirring until you hit that sweet spot. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if required.Divide the pasta and sauce between four hot plates, sprinkle over the nuts and, if you’re feeling racy, nestle an egg yolk in the centre. If you’ve added the egg yolk, encourage your guests to stir it into the pasta before they start eating, so the residual heat gently cooks it. Eat immediately, topped with more grated parmesan, if you like. I’d recommend crunchy bread on the side to mop up the sauce.Fettuccine with ’nduja, lemon and mascarponeView image in fullscreenTim Siadatan’s fettuccine with ’nduja lemon and mascarpone.I’ve always wanted to make a pasta dish using ’nduja where the chilli doesn’t blow your head off. Here, the addition of mascarpone mellows the spiciness of the sausage and creates a smooth, creamy yet rich sauce. The strength of ’nduja varies, so you may need to use a bit more or less – taste it first and adjust accordingly. The acidity in the lemon, meanwhile, brings balance, harmony and zing. This sauce also works well with freshpici, or dried spaghetti, bucatini, linguine, penne, fusilli and farfalle.Prep10 minCook30 minServes4About 75g ’nduja500g mascarponeFinely grated zest and juice of 1 lemonSea salt450g fresh fettuccine, or dried4 tbsp finely chopped flat-leaf parsleyParmesan, finely grated, to finishPut the ’nduja in a bowl and bring to room temperature, so it becomes malleable. Add the mascarpone and lemon zest, and mix to a smoothish paste. It can now be stored in a sealed container in the fridge for up to five days.Bring four to five litres of water to a boil in a large pot and add a fistful of salt. Put the ’nduja-mascarpone paste in a pan large enough to hold the cooked pasta easily. Add half a mug (about 120ml) of the salted pasta water and heat gently, stirring, to melt the paste and create a sauce. Take off the heat.Loosen the fresh pasta bundles, so they won’t stick together as they cook, then drop into the boiling water and cook for a minute to a minute and a half; if using dried fettuccine, cook for eight to 10 minutes, or according to the packet instructions, until al dente. Drain the pasta and reserve two mugs of its cooking water.Transfer the pasta to the pan of ’nduja sauce and add half a mug (about 120ml) of the reserved water, the lemon juice, chopped parsley and a pinch of salt. Stir vigorously for at least 30 seconds, until the sauce is mixed around the pasta and turns smooth and creamy; if the sauce seems too dry, add splashes of reserved pasta water to loosen it as you stir. You want the strands to slide freely over each other, and for a layer of sauce to cover the bottom of the pan; my visual reference for the sauce is a slow-moving lava field. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if required.Serve on hot plates with a creamy halo of sauce all around the pasta, then finish with grated parmesan. The sauce sucks up the parmesan quickly and can easily become dry, so be sure to have that excess halo around the plated pasta.Tim Siadatan is co-founder ofTrulloandPadella, both in London.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies has suggested, however, thathigh take-up rates could make the annual bill £1bn higher than the initial estimates.The impact of the expanded childcare offer has been immediate for Alec’s family: “The childcare fees for my child this month have been reduced by circa 55%, saving me a few hundred quid a month. It also says a lot about how unaffordable life is for most of the country when even those who are relatively well-off are genuinely relieved to have some extra money in the bank at the end of the month.”Alec’s verdict is not shared by everyone. Early years providers across the country have been campaigning for years against the funded childcare scheme, complaining that the government underfunds the “free” hours so that settings are forced to incur losses on every free hour offered, increase their fees elsewhere or hire less experienced staff on lower pay.This unresolved problem of funding shortfalls affects parents, their children and the sector in various ways. One unintended consequence of the scheme is that some settings simply refuse to offer parents the free childcare hours they are officially entitled to.“The nursery my child attends is simply not offering the free hours,” said Jennifer,a publishing professional from Oxford. “They have a waiting list of over two years as they are popular but more importantly there is an acute shortage of providers. The funding does not cover the cost of the sessions, so the only way for them to cope would have been to put up base fees to cover the shortfall – they felt this was unfair for ineligible parents so have opted not to offer the scheme.”“While we qualify for the 30 funded hours, our nursery can only accept 20 of them due to funding shortfalls that fail to cover their operating costs,” said Amy, from Kent.“As a result, our monthly childcare expense for one child remains £1,668.92, a significant financial strain.“The scheme is poorly thought out and barely scratches the surface. This is a systemic issue that desperately needs addressing.”Alec, Jennifer and Amy were among a host of parents who shared how they had been affected by the expansion of the funded childcare scheme, and how they feel about it.Amy was one of various parents who highlighted that while the government had decided to spend additional billions of pounds on expanding the funded childcare offer, parents’ nursery fees were often rising regardless as settings were trying to recoup rising operating costs.“Following Rachel Reeves’s increase in employers’ national insurance, childcare providers nationwide have raised their fees,” she added. “A recent survey carried out by National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA) found that nurseries are increasing feesby an average of 10%to offset rising employment costs. In our case, our nursery applied an 8% fee increase in September 2025, a staggering leap for already stretched budgets.”“Increased funded hours mean nursery prices in our town have all risen, to cover the [funding] shortfall,” said Roo, a civil servant in her 40s from Hampshire whose household does not qualify for the funded childcare scheme as her partner earns over the £100k income eligibility threshold per working parent.“Our fees went up by 30% in April, an increase of £330 per month. It does feel like we are paying [extra] for something we are not eligible to access.” She pointed out that many higher earners who narrowly missed out on being eligible for the free childcare were cutting their hours or paying more income into pension schemes to become eligible.“It’s people who are realising that they could work less, have more money in their bank account, and get more time with their children. This scheme is counterproductive in many ways, in a country that’s struggling economically with under-productivity.”Roo was also among multiple parents who reported that the free childcare entitlement itself had not meant improved access to the hours families actually needed. Such responses seemed to suggest that the expanded scheme had created a higher demand for places that settings have beenunable to accommodateeverywhere.“The increased demand at nurseries means that they are less flexible now,” Roo said. “We were not able to get a place at our first choice despite registering whilst pregnant, and there is little room for manoeuvre [in choosing specific days parents need childcare on each week].”Sarah, a mother from Liverpool, shared a similar experience.“I put my daughter’s name down for a nursery place two weeks after she was born, and the next available place was almost two years away,” she said.“After phoning 15 nurseries I was only offered a Friday afternoon, which is the only time I don’t work. My husband has been forced to stop work so that I, as the main earner, can return to work until a place is available when my child is nearly two. This is our third child, we didn’t have this problem at all with the older two, we could choose a nursery that we liked and the days that we needed – a distant dream now!”“I wish politicians would take a longer view and tackle this properly, rather than this sticking plaster which might make a good headline,” said Jennifer from Oxford. “On the ground it’s a different story.”Explore more on these topicsChildcareChildrenDepartment for EducationEarly years educationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The warm summer months are behind us and it is time to carry out some checks to make sure your home is ready for chillier weather.If your boiler has not had its annual service it is time to book one. This will ensure it is working as it should and uncover problems before they become bigger. Some boiler warranties will say the unit has to be serviced once a year to continue cover. Keeping a boiler serviced will also help you avoid repair costs in the future.The websiteCheckatradeputs the average cost of a service at between £80 and £120, although there may be further fees to fix any problems. Make sure you use aGas Safe registered engineer.Put the central heating on and check each radiator to see whether part or all of it stays cold. If so,you will need to bleed itto release the trapped air inside. You will need a radiator key (50p to £3 in a DIY shop). Turn off the central heating and then open the valve with the key, releasing the air and closing it once water comes out.To increase the efficiency of your heating, you can fit reflector panels behind radiators on external walls to reflect heat back into the room instead of losing it. Three panels are availablefrom B&Q for £23.90.Check that your thermostat is set to the lowest comfortable temperature, which is usually 18-21C. If you turn it down by 1C you can save £60 on heating bills, according to the Energy Saving Trust. Experts recommend that heating controls that are more than 14 years old be replaced with more modern versions.View image in fullscreenHave you checked each radiator to see whether part or all of it stays cold?Photograph: Bruno Sinnah/AlamyFix draughtsDraught-proof your home by checking for rattles, whistling noises and moving air around doors, windows, floorboards and other places with possible gaps. You can use foam, metal or plastic strips around the frames of windows to prevent gaps. Brush draught excluders can be fitted at the bottom of exterior doors, while holes in floorboards can be filled with a silicone-based filler, theEnergy Saving Trustadvises. It estimates you could save up to £85 a year by draught-proofing a home.Unused chimneys are another source of draughts. You can fit a terracotta cap on top (priced at about £150), which protects from moisture and birds, or a draught excluder inside the chimney to stop warm air going up and cold coming in. Chimney Sheep draught excludersstart at £19.View image in fullscreenThe Energy Saving Trust estimates you could save up to £85 a year by draught-proofing a home.Photograph: Scott Ramsey/AlamySort out your tariffEnergy bills will rise for millions of households in October when the energy regulator for Great Britain, Ofgem,increases the price cap by 2%to £1,755. That is the equivalent of just over £35 extra a year for those on a standard variable tariff, although how much you pay will depend on your usage, location and method of payment.If you are on an SVT, you can probably make savings by moving on to a fixed-rate or tracker deal. Look at comparison sites such as Uswitch or Compare the Market to see what deals are available to you. You will need to put in your address to see what is out there.Uswitch says 41 fixed-rate deals will finish by the end of OctoberIf you are already on a fixed-rate deal, check when it ends. Uswitch says 41 fixed-rate deals will finish by the end of October, and consumers on them may have to pay up to £202 a year more for their energy if they are not prepared. Households on fixed-rate deals are free to switch 49 days before the tariff ends without paying exit fees.Luckily, according to Uswitch’s energy expert Will Owen: “This is a particularly strong time for savings, with about 26 fixed deals currently available which beat the October cap, and savings of about £241 available on the market.”Two of the market-leading tariffs are from Outfox Energy, which is offering a 12-month fix at an average bill of £1,514 and two years at £1,516.You should be able to switch providers within five working days. If you do switch, you have a 14-day cooling-off period where you do not have to pay any exit fees.Safety test your gearIt could be months since you have thought about items you use to stay warm, and in the meantime they may have been deteriorating. Check they are still in working order before your need them.Make sure your hot-water bottleis not too old– they should be replaced every two to three years. You can check the date it was made by the flower on the neck: the number in the middle is the year the bottle was made; the petals represent months and the dots weeks.View image in fullscreenHot-water bottles should be replaced every two to three years.Photograph: Horst Friedrichs/AlamyCheck the wires on electric heaters. When plugged in a heater should be kept at least a metre (3ft) from surrounding objects and not left unattended for long periods of time or overnight. Plug them directly into the mains; do not use an extension lead as it may overload.Replace electric blankets if they are soiled or worn, especially if wires are visible. If a blanket has been folded rather than rolled up, check it has not become worn along the fold lines. Replace a blanket if it is 10 years old or more. Good quality, new ones range in price fromabout £30 to £140.Prepare any fireplace by having your chimney swept so your room will be well ventilated. The British Pest Control Association advises people to check their chimneys for nests of jackdaws before the arrival of autumn and cooler weather.Make sure you have a working carbon monoxide alarm in the same room.Test all of your smoke alarms to make sure they are working and have full batteries.Clean up outsideCheck your roof for missing, cracked or damaged tiles, particularly around the chimney, that could lead to leaks. If there are patches of green or black, this could be algae that can damage the roof. This can betreated with a soft brush, a cleaning solution or by installing zinc or copper strips, that prevent buildup. Replace any missing or slipped tiles.Clean out the gutters to avoid flooding and damage to the roof. To get a tradesperson in to do this will cost between £50 and £300, according to Checkatrade, with prices varying depending on the size of the house and where it is in the country.Strong winds during the autumn and winter could dislodge fence panels so make sure they are all secure.Barbecues, trampolines and garden furniture should be put away, as should any tools that are lying around outside. If there is not space in a shed for them, cover them and secure them to the ground with weights.If you have tender plants that will not survive colder weather, move them indoors and trim back any overgrown shrubs to reduce any risk of damage in high winds.Explore more on these topicsHome improvementsMoney hacksEnergy billsConsumer affairsSaving moneyHousehold billsPropertyDIYfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My insurer issued me with three successive courtesy cars while mine was out of action. I thereforebought courtesy permits for each vehicle so I could continue driving into the zone. I have a disability and I am dependent on my car.I’ve been receiving PCNs every week andmore arrive even while I’m appealing against them.I face a total bill of £3,000 and it’s causing me immense stress, but the council’s approach has felt inflexible and unsympathetic.IL,LondonHealthy school streets are a laudable initiative, adopted by several London boroughs, that restricts access to certain zones at the start and finish of the school day. It’s crucial, however, that those with disabilities can still reach the school gate and blue badge holders are eligible for access permits.You duly applied for temporary permits for each of the courtesy cars you were given after your accident, but due to the short notice with which the cars were changed by your insurer it seems there was a time lapse between one of the renewals.Since you were driving into the zone twice a day, five days a week, this triggered an avalanche of PCNs.I think Newham council should have cancelled them when you wrote in saying you are on record as a blue badge holder. Instead, it rejected your appeals.Its conscience only pricked when I questioned its intransigence. “In light of the circumstances, and to bring this matter to a fair conclusion, the council has taken the decision to cancel all of the PCNs issued in this case,” a spokesperson said. “Steps are also being taken to strengthen our processes around courtesy permits to reduce the risk of similar issues occurring in future.”We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

Its reasonably priced facial products are well worth your consideration. The body range may feel less economical, since even luxury skincare lovers are often used to parting with a fiver or less for a body lotion, but the brand delivers as well below the neck as above it.ItsBio-Lipid Restoring Body Lotion(£18) is close to perfect if you experience dry, itchy, perhaps eczema-prone skin but find heavy, unctuous creams a turnoff. This has a whipped, rich texture that hits the driest spots without stickiness, and the large bottle and generous, time-saving pump (one depression is enough for a leg, from hip to toe) make it feel luxuriously abundant.It passes the silk blouse test: you can get dressed soon after applying with no seepage on to thin fabricsI’m a longtime fan of Garnier’s Body Superfood, an affordable range of gratifyingly stout pots of cream. If you’ve found some too rich in texture, do try the watermelon variant, theGlycerin Hydrating Body Cream(£9.99). The lighter, refreshing silky gel consistency disguises a healthy dose of glycerin that leaves rough limbs soft and supple for hours. It’s a good option for body cream haters, but also for those looking to switch to something less cloying in warmer weather.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The families of local fishers do a brisk trade at stands piled high with still-wriggling sole, plaice, mackerel, crab and red mullet that have come straight from the nets of small boats docked below on the quayside.View image in fullscreenMonet painted several pictures of Trouville in 1870 including the boardwalk.Photograph: AlamyFor visitors who have booked one of Trouville’s numerous self-catering apartments, the market is an ideal place to shop for dinner or a picnic, but I carry on into the centre of town to the unbeatably pricedHôtel Le Fer à Cheval(doubles from just €59 room-only in winter/around€140 in peak season). Identical twins Virginie and Sonia Bisson created their smart, welcoming hotel from three adjoining mansions 20 years ago, and are a mine of insider tips. So after checking in my bags, I take their advice and head straight for the beach bar Le Galatée a couple of hundred yards away from the hotel.The Queen of Beaches now resembles a stately dowager, spoiling holidaymakers with classic seaside treats, from pony rides to petanqueAn iconic wooden boardwalk, Promenade Savignac,runs parallel to the lapping waves for more than a kilometre, the scene pretty much unchanged from Claude Monet’s 1870 impressionist masterpiece Promenade à Trouville. The terrace of Le Galatée is certainly the strategic place to sit, indulging in their famous chocolat chaud or an ice-cream sundae while taking the pulse of what is now a buzzing family resort.The Reine des Plages now resembles a stately dowager, spoiling holidaymakers with classic seaside treats such as pony rides on the beach, mini golf and petanque. The boardwalk is lined with Normandy’s distinctive 19th-century half-timbered villas and palatial mansions, each trying to outdo its neighbour for opulence and grandeur. The iconicHôtel Les Roches Noires– again immortalised by Monet, whose painting now hangs in the Musée d’Orsay – is a luxurious hotel, as many of these stately piles once were until they were converted into private apartments.View image in fullscreenThe town’s distinctive belle epoque architecture .Photograph: Mihai Barbat/AlamyWhile Deauville’s boardwalk is lined with art deco bathing cabins dedicated to Hollywood stars who have attended theDeauville American Film Festival, such as Gene Kelly, Kirk Douglas and Marilyn Monroe, Trouville offers plain wooden benches bearing the names of writers drawn here for inspiration: Gustave Flaubert, Marcel Proust, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas. Just behind Les Roches Noires, I walk uphill to the imposingVilla Montebello, home of the municipal museum, where I discover that Trouville was also a favourite destination for the 19th-century painters Courbet, Corot, Caillebotte and above all Eugène Boudin, later acclaimed as the father of impressionismAside from lazing on the beach, browsing retro fashion boutiques such as À La Petite Jeannette and Devred 1902, or exploring Trouville’s distinctive maze of narrow alleyways and steep staircases that climb high above the main town, the big draw here is eating out. Like every visitor, I am charmed by the raucous fishmongers lining the landmark Marché aux Poissons. With tables along the pavement, they serveplateaux de fruits de merpiled high with oysters, clams, prawns, whelks, cockles and mussels. Lunch is a memorable occasion, especially accompanied by a chilled bottle of Muscadet, though beware the bill – the prices you see on the stall are for takeaway, with a mark-up when served at the table. As Stéphane Brassy, president of the Trouville fishmongers association, tells me between shucking oysters: “We have queues of tourists lining up here every day of the week. Everyone loves the banter and understands that the quality of our fish and seafood comes at a certain price.”View image in fullscreenSeafood at the town’s fish market.Photograph: Image Professionals/AlamyIn the evening, plush brasseries such asLes VapeursandLe Centralare packed, but in the back streets I discover two exceptional addresses that have both been open for less than a year.

His name betrays Anglo-French roots, but Jarvis says that, “even though I was brought up on baked beans and fried sausages, my cooking inspiration is very much French. I was looking to escape the high-pressure cooking world of Parisian fine dining and Trouville was the perfect solution, especially with the wonderful local produce from small boat fishers and organic farmers.” His menu changes every week and includes dishes such as deep-fried artichoke resting on a creamy chicken liver mousse, frogs’ legs alongside spicy merguez sausage, smoked beetroot with tapenade and wild sorrel.But Trouville-sur-mer is not just a seaside destination, as the idyllic Normandy countryside of the Pays d’Auge begins just outside town.Les Trouvillaisesbike shop recommends hiring an ebike (€35 per day) to comfortably explore the region’s rolling hills, and a leisurely 22-mile (35km) ride allows for stop-offs at an artisan dairy farm and ancientcidrerie.AtLa Ferme Martin, Thierry and Caroline Martin are the fourth generation to produce artisan, raw-milk Pont-l’Évêque cheese. Each morning, Caroline takes the still-warm milk, fresh from their 60-cow herd, and makes cheeses in her tiny dairy, where a steady stream of locals and tourists turn up to buy direct from the farm.View image in fullscreenBeach huts on Promenade Savignac with 19th-century villas behind.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyJust outside the bustling market town of Pont-l’Évêque lies the sprawling 17th-century manor and orchards ofMaison Drouin, the perfect place to discover the secrets of cider and calvados. Half a dozen Normancolombage(half-timbered) outbuildings house a press for creating the apple juice, vats to ferment and age the cider, an alembic still for distilling, a barrel room to age the calvados, and a busy boutique. No reservation is necessary, and as Guillaume Drouin explains, “We offer the chance to taste all our products, take a tour explaining our orchards with 36 varieties of apples, then see how we make everything. There is no charge, because I want our visitors to try, to understand and enjoy, rather than thinking they are paying to enter some kind of tourist attraction.”Back in Trouville, on the way to the station, I cannot resist a glimpse inside the fabulous belle epoqueCasino Barrière, an opulent reminder that this was one of the early magnets drawing travellers to Normandy a century ago. Just outside, in a former police building, a new attraction is opening at the end of October:Le Ciné Bistrois the brainchild of Claude Lelouch, director of the acclaimedUn Homme et Une Femme(1966), which he filmed in Trouville, and will offer an evening movie screening followed by dinner. Definitely a good reason to come back.The trip wasprovided byCalvados Attractivité.

Paralysed from the chest down, he had to learn to live in a new, uncharted realityLucy KnightWed 24 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTShareMarc Brew was sitting in the back seat of a car on a motorway near Johannesburg, telling jokes and laughing with his friends, when a pickup came hurtling down the wrong side of the road towards them. “Out of nowhere, I just remember seeing this white flash,” says Brew, who was 20 at the time. The truck, which he later found out had a drunk driver at the wheel, drove straight into the car he was in. The crash killed everyone else in the vehicle.Nine months previously, Brew had moved from Australia to South Africa to join the Pact ballet company, based in Pretoria. That Saturday, he had attended his usual morning dance classes, before he and his friend Joanne, another member of the company, set off with her brother, Simon, and Simon’s fiancee’s brother, Toby, towards a game reserve where they had planned to go bush walking. When the truck hit, “it was like time froze”, Brew, now 48, recalls. “I remember my ears were ringing really loud, like I’d been at a concert.”View image in fullscreenYoung talent … Marc Brew before the accident, at the Australian Ballet School in 1996.Photograph: Courtesy of Marc BrewJoanne had fallen off the seat next to Brew’s and was at his feet. In the front of the car, Brew remembers seeing Simon slumped over the steering wheel and Toby, who was only 16, on the dashboard. “I was trying to yell out to them, but I didn’t know if I was being verbal. I just couldn’t move. And I remember my neck was hurting,” he says. “Then I must have lost consciousness.”When Brew came round, he could feel a pain in his neck and gravel digging in to the back of his head – he had been moved to the side of the road. “Well, I’m alive,” he thought, when he heard people talking. It was a hot day, and he could make out shadows, as people moved around him, and heard someone say: “You’ll be OK.”“Don’t worry about me – I’m fine,” he replied. “Just look after Joanne, Simon and Toby.” He still had the image in his head of them inside the car.He was bundled into an ambulance, then a helicopter, with just one thought racing through his mind before he lost consciousness again: “I’ve got to tell my mum.” Brew grew up in a single-parent family, living with his mother in a two-bedroom flat in Jerilderie, a small rural town in New South Wales. She had always been his biggest supporter. She sent him to his first dance class when he was a small child, and, after he was offered a scholarship to a dance boarding school in Melbourne, aged 10, she regularly drove the eight-hour round trip to visit him.The next thing he remembers, she was there. Brew had been in hospital for two weeks by the time his mother and aunt arrived from Australia – his mother had to get an emergency passport and borrow money for the flight, as well as organise childcare for Brew’s two half-siblings – but he doesn’t remember anything from that period. He found out later that he had been bleeding internally because of the impact of the seatbelt during the crash (“but the seatbelt also did save my life”) so the doctors, he says, “shoved me with ice packs” to try to stop the bleeding. That worked, and surgeons were able to operate on the organs that had been damaged. “My plumbing got reorganised a little bit,” Brew says. “Once I was stable from all those internal injuries, they then noticed my legs weren’t moving any more.”View image in fullscreenFlying high … Brew in the Sleeping Beauty, in 1997, before his accident.Photograph: Courtesy of Marc BrewThough hospital records showed Brew had been able to move his limbs when he was first admitted, he can only remember waking up in a body he could barely move. Initially, it wasn’t just his legs he couldn’t feel – he couldn’t speak or use his arms either, abilities that gradually came back to him. “I remember seeing my body and I didn’t recognise it,” he says. “My feet were swollen, they just weren’t moving, nothing was moving. So it felt totally foreign.” Being a dancer, he was used to feeling in tune with his body. “And now that was all cut off.”He was sent for a CT scan, which found that his spinal cord had been injured at the neck, leaving him paralysed from the chest down. While he was in the scanner, he suffered a cardiac arrest, waking up to someone resuscitating him. This was one of several times Brew felt close to death during his time in hospital: “I remember having lots of feelings and sensations like I was sinking in my bed and falling away to black,” he says. “I really had to keep on fighting hard, almost like coming out of water, trying to get up to breathe, to survive.”Dance is about expressing myself through movement, and I could still do thatFor a few weeks, he chose not to think about the possibility that his sensation might never return. “I was in denial completely,” he says. As a dancer, he was used to dealing with injuries and going through rehabilitation. “It’s fine,” he remembers thinking. He was keen to get back to Australia, where he believed he would “just go to rehab and do exercises and work hard”.It wasn’t until “this horrible moment” when a doctor informed him he was paralysed that he was forced to come to terms with what his future might look like. “It was like a movie, really, where the doctor comes in and then tells you, ‘Sorry, Mr Brew, but you’re never going to walk again’,” he says.View image in fullscreenA new direction … Brew in For Now, I Am, when he decided he needed to reframe his goals.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian“That can’t be happening to me,” was his first thought. “I’m Marc. I’m a dancer … I can’t not walk again.”It was at around the same time – about a month into his hospital stay – that Brew found out his friends had died. He “sort of knew” that Simon and Toby were dead, he says, having seen their faces in the car. But Joanne’s face had been covered by her hair. “I don’t know why, but I thought that Joanne was going to be OK,” he says – until her best friend came to visit him and told him she hadn’t made it. At the time, he was communicating via an alphabet board, using blinks to spell out words, letter by letter. When he asked where Joanne was, her friend pointed upwards. He thought she must be in the ward above him. “Then she said to me: ‘Joanne’s in heaven.’”It was a while before he was ready to ask what had happened to the driver of the other car. He was told that he was alive, and hadn’t suffered any serious injuries. He had been arrested and was later jailed. Joanne’s parents – who had lost their son and their daughter – were so angry “they couldn’t even bear to see me”, Brew says. Through therapy and rehabilitation, Brew’s own anger eventually passed, but he still didn’t buy the argument of some of his religious friends: “This happened for a reason.”He says: “Joanne, Simon and Toby were loving, caring, funny people. How come their lives were taken away and how come my life was left like this? I can’t see any reason for that.”View image in fullscreenBrew works with dancers at Zaccho Dance theater in San Francisco, California.Photograph: San Francisco Chronicle/Hearst Newspapers/Getty ImagesSo Brew decided to make the most of his life in his friends’ honour. He felt “a huge lot of responsibility”, as the only survivor. “I now had to survive for them as well. No one told me that I had to do that, but I felt that. I still feel that.”After three months in the South African hospital, Brew was allowed to travel back to Australia, where he spent a further four months in a residential rehabilitation centre. The flight was a “horrible, demeaning experience”, with other passengers peering up at him as he lay on a stretcher underneath the overhead luggage compartments.He grew to dread public attention: after developing his motor skills and learning to use his wheelchair in the safety of rehab, Brew joined some of his fellow residents on an outing to a shopping mall. “Everyone stared at me because I was in this wheelchair and it was just horrible,” he says. “That took a lot to manage to deal with.”At first, Brew found it hard to accept his physical limitations and the help he now required. “I was just naive and stubborn,” he says. “I didn’t want my nan to see me. I didn’t want family to see me. Because I was always the one making something of their life, you know, this country boy who moved to the city to be a dancer.”View image in fullscreenA life turned upside down … Brew in An Accident/A Life, a dramatisation of the crash.Photograph: Filip Van RoeAnd now?“I was so exposed and didn’t want anyone to see me vulnerable like that,” he says. As he struggled to come to terms with the fact he needed assistance with basic tasks – such as the time he had to ask his mum to help him have a bath – “there were moments that were really, really low and dark,” he says.Yet, throughout it all, “in my head, it was me”, Brew says. “I still felt like me: Marc the dancer.” Two years after leaving rehab, he began dancing again, having been put in touch with the disability activist and dancer Kitty Lunn by friends in the US. Lunn invited Brew to visit her in New York, where he went to ballet classes and “rediscovered dance again”.The dance style he has since developed relies on incredible upper body strength and complete precision of movement. Colin Hambrook described Brew’s “flawless, virtuoso dance skills” in a review of Brew’s 2015 show For Now, I Am ... forDisability Arts Online. “Slight movements of the fingers, hands, arms, torso and head are redolent with intention,” the critic wrote.View image in fullscreenAmbitious work … Brew on stage in An Accident/A Life.Photograph: Filip Van RoeSometimes, but not always, Brew incorporates a wheelchair into his work. His “biggest, most ambitious work to date” is his most recent project, An Accident/A Life, a collaboration with choreographer Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui that tells the story of the car crash.For most of the performance, he is on the floor, creating shapes with his upper body and lifting himself using his arms to move around the stage, only introducing a wheelchair in the final five minutes. “Navigating and moving from one scene to the next without having the support of a chair, that’s quite physically demanding,” Brew says – but it made the most sense for the story, given that, when the crash happened, he didn’t have a wheelchair. He was also interested in challenging audience’s perceptions of disabled artists: “It made me think about when the audience comes in, if someone doesn’t know me, or doesn’t know anything about this story and this work, what do they think when they first see me on stage?”Brew never thought he would make a piece about the car crash, but the performance is “not just about the crash”, he says. “It’s about finding a life again.”When he first returned to dancing after the accident, though, “I had to stop looking in the mirror because I’d get frustrated,” he says. “I wanted to just get up and show everyone how to move and how to dance like I used to and I couldn’t.” It took him a while to realise that “dance wasn’t about having beautiful legs, turnout, flexibility, how high you jumped.Danceis about expressing myself through movement, and I could still do that.” Though it was completely different from the career he had in mind previously – after spending a couple of years in South Africa, he had planned to move to the UK or the Netherlands to dance with Rambert or the Nederlands Dans Theater – new possibilities opened up to him.Since the crash nearly 30 years ago, Brew has danced and choreographed all over the world, moving to London in 2003 to joinCandoco, a dance company that includes disabled and non-disabled dancers. Now he has his own dance ensemble, theMarc Brew Companyin Glasgow, where he lives with his partner, Matthew, and son Jedidiah, born via surrogacy two-and-a-half years ago. Jedidiah is “the light of our lives”, Brew says.I spent my childhood in and out of hospital. At 19, I finally realised I had a terminal diseaseRead moreSince the accident, “my identity has shifted”, the dancer says. “I’m a gay man, I’m now a father – I identify in many different ways.” Brew has reached the point where he feels empowered by his disability. That’s not to say frustrations don’t still creep in: he still catches himself thinking, “I could just get up and just do it and it would be much easier.”But when those thoughts come, he tells himself: “Marc, take a breath. You know you’ll find another way of doing it.” Being disabled has encouraged him to be more creative and adaptable. “Things don’t have to be the way you think,” he says.Brew has never taken no for an answer: as a child, he stuck with his dance classes, despite being told he shouldn’t because he was a boy. Later, he met those telling him he couldn’t dance because he was disabled with the same determination. “How lucky am I?” he says. “I’m still able to do what I love to do, and dance and share and create and perform my work for other people, and to be an artist, even though I was told I couldn’t.”Marc Brew and Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui’s show, An Accident/A Life, is atSadler’s Wells East theatre, London, from 25-27 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsDanceHow we surviveDisabilityBalletfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But our lost relationship became the furnace that forged meJodie HarshWed 24 Sep 2025 01.55 EDTShareIn 2000, my dad wrote me a letter saying he found it hard to love me. “I don’t even understand you,” he said. He slipped it under my bedroom door when I was at my lowest point. The sentences split me wide open.I was always the pretty little boy in the corner of the playground, plaiting girls’ hair, dreaming of spotlights. My flamboyance didn’t seem to have an off switch. Dad tried his best to steer me into his version of a “proper” boyhood: football boots, muddy knees, the whole shebang. He’d tap my limp wrists into place and drag me to self-defence lessons in an attempt to turn them into karate chops.Maybe I embarrassed him – I wasn’t just different, I wasloudlydifferent. Maybe he saw me as a reflection of himself – if his son was soft, then what did that make him? Maybe it worried him, too – it’s a dangerous world out there, and his paternal job to protect might have felt compromised.When I was 15, London became like sticky flypaper to me. I’d get the train from Kent, fake ID in my pocket, to wallow in a fug of sweat, smoke and pulsing bass. I began to live a double life, blissfully shielded from what society – and my father – expected me to be. I found booze and party drugs, and tethered myself to a motley crew of older friends. I was on an adventure.Weekdays in suburbia moved in polite, predictable slow motion. School slouched by. Then, on Saturday nights, everything shifted into light speed. Nightclubs felt fast, dizzying, alive – and I got lost in their pace.It all came crashing down, of course. My growing truancy sparked suspicion, and my school outed me – not explicitly, but with concerned calls home, a comment about “behaviour” or “peer dynamics”. I was dragged out of the closet – and off the dancefloor – in one brutal swoop.I remember a Friday evening, after school, being called into the living room for “a talk” with my dad. I was so nervous I could taste my own heartbeat, my guts twisting into knots.“Are you queer?” he asked – blunt, no frills. I replied, defiantly, “yes”, then turned to hide my trembling lip. I told him I was proud to be who I was and had no plans to change. He slid the letter in question under my door that night.From then on, a silence settled between us. He couldn’t even face eating dinner in the same room as me and I found myself slipping into a profound and non-negotiable depression.View image in fullscreenJodie Harsh, pictured circa 1991.Photograph: Courtesy of Jodie HarshWe looked alike – identical, in fact, when I saw pictures of him at my age – but in that moment it became my mission to reject every one of his character traits. At 18, I moved to London, the city that promised reinvention. There, I could be someone else entirely.I learned early to mask, to put my guard up.Dragbecame my canvas. I worked in nightclubs, and suddenly I was getting attention from adoring crowds, but only by disguising myself. I was caught somewhere between a fierce desire to be seen and the reluctance to be truly known.Behind the DJ decks, I earned respect for my creativity – something my dad once nurtured, even if he couldn’t have seen where it would take me. My partying multiplied – nights so wild they often left teeth marks.Many of my new friends shared similar stories: disappointment from their dads lurking beneath the glitter.Distance helped. Despite our differences, we strained a relationship, going through the motions for a few more years. But I kept my Jodie persona a secret – he already struggled to look me in the eye.One day, his wife called me. They’d been watching a TV makeover show, she said, and I’d popped up in a guest spot I’d filmed. I was in full drag regalia, but my dad recognised my voice, and mysecondcoming out took place. There was no confrontation; he simply stopped communicating with me for ever.This time, it wasn’t shocking; it felt almost procedural. But it hurt even more. I was rejected for my creative expression, the thing most dear to me. The parts of me that were deemed interesting to others were the parts of me that scared him.After a decade and a half, I’d stopped wondering if a birthday card was going to land on my doormat. I became grateful for his absence. The loss became the furnace that forged me – fuel for my unyielding drive to prove I could, andwould, make something of myself. Dad’s abandonment left a vacuum, and in that space, I built a career.“Should I write him my own letter?” I once asked my sister. “Don’t bother,” she said, flatly. “You won’t hear back.” I realised we were going to remain in this cold war until one of us died.And then, he did.Dad had a heart attack last year. It was too late to reconcile. No dramatic deathbed reunion, no final phone call, just a quiet conclusion.I’m glad I went to his funeral. I hid towards the back, realising almost no one there knew he had a son.My bitterness lifted, and I realised some relationships don’t need to be forced into repair.

Kirk’s podcast, The Charlie Kirk Show, now No 1 on the podcast charts, has had a rotating cast of hosts including Tucker Carlson, Glenn Beck and JD Vance, who used his appearance to announce a crackdown on “far-left” groups, promising to “dismantle” them in Kirk’s name.“Manosphere”mainstay Joe Rogan was initially quiet on the Kirk shooting, releasing prerecorded episodes while he was away elk hunting. On Tuesday he beganchallenging the official narrative of the killing, but has been more focused on the practicalities of the weapon used and the getaway than exploring the motivations of the killer, perhaps because Kirk was too much of an explicit rightwing partisan to chime with Rogan’s libertarianism.The students who debated with Charlie Kirk: ‘His goal was to verbally defeat us’Read moreWith Rogan steering clear of Kirk’s politics, other rightwing figures in the podcast space are pushing their own narratives and conspiracy theories about Kirk’s death and shooting up the podcast charts as they do so – chief among them Candace Owens, who is now No 2 on Spotify’s trending podcast chart, just behind Kirk’s podcast.Owens has spent the past week using her podcast to cast doubt that Kirk’s killing was the action of a sole shooter. (Tyler Robinson, 22, isfacing charges of aggravated murderand felony discharge of a firearm, among others, in the death of Kirk.) This week she published podcasts titled: “Charlie Kirk Suspect Charged. Something Isn’t Right…”, “Who Ordered the Hit on Charlie Kirk?” and “They Are Lying About Charlie Kirk.”But Owens is not convinced by the Donald Trump-led conspiracy that the organised left is to be blamed for Kirk’s killing. Instead, she is pushing an alternate theory that Kirk’s death is part of a large global conspiracy with Israel at the centre. She is not alone in believing there is an Israeli plot behind Kirk’s murder – a number of far-right influencersincluding Ian Carroll and Jackson Hinklehave suggested that Israel may have played a role, so much so that Benjamin Netanyahu has issued two separate denials of his involvement.View image in fullscreenCharlie Kirk and Candace Owens greet the crowd at a Turning Point USA event on the University of Colorado Boulder campus in 2018.Photograph: MediaNews Group/Boulder Daily Camera/Getty ImagesTo understand her conspiracy, you have to be very acquainted with a network of rightwing groups and podcasts that all reference each other. Essentially Owens believes that Kirk was wavering on his support for Israel, and had invited Carlson and Dave Smith – rightwingers who do not support the war in Gaza, to Turning Point USA events, where they took to the lectern to challenge the war and the influence of Israeli funding on US politics. She claimed Kirk told her that he was being threatened by the Israeli government and by Bill Ackman – the pro-Israel, pro-Trump hedge fund manager.Owens provides no conclusive evidence about these threats, instead leveraging her close friendship with Kirk to suggest she understands a deeper truth about the threats he was facing. In 2017, Kirk hired Owens at Turning Point USA as a “director of urban engagement”, after claims the rightwing organization had issues with racism. Owens was forced to resign from the group in 2019 (after saying Adolf Hitler would have been “fine” if he had focused on domestic politics) but the pair remained close; this week she described him as a “brother”. Her podcasts on his killing feel pained and unrestrained – as you might expect from someone who had just seen their friend assassinated.Owens is careful not say that Israel killed Kirk – but she uses implication and association to keep alive the idea that Netanyahu may be involved: “I’m not trying to mutter darkly or imply anything … but I think it’s important to say that out loud because it’s a fact, and there are many liars out there trying, Bibi Netanyahu No 1 among them, shamefully, who are trying to distort the truth, a truth that I know and can prove,” she said.These allegations are being taken seriously enough to have warranted rebuttals from Ackman and Netanyahu. Ackman posted cordial text messages between himself and Kirk as evidence that he never threatened him, adding: “at no time have I ever threatened Charlie Kirk, Turning Point or anyone associated with him.” Netanyahu has made two separate statements denying the “insane”, “false” and “outrageous” rumors that Israel was involved in Kirk’s death.Much of Owens’ theorizing repeats a mix of anti-Zionist and antisemitic sentiment. In her podcasts, she talks about the “Zionist-controlled publications”, that “Joseph Goebbels has nothing on the Zionists in America and the propaganda that they have pushed” and that Sigmund Freud, not Goebbels, is the “real father of modern propaganda”. Others are going further, including Carroll, the podcaster who is telling his 1.3 million followers on X that he thinks Israel is responsible for the death of Kirk. Carroll has previously been a guest on Owens’ and Rogan’s shows.View image in fullscreenTucker Carlson speaks at the Charlie Kirk memorial in Glendale, Arizona, on 21 September 2025.Photograph: Daniel Cole/ReutersAt Kirk’s funeral, Carlson more subtly invoked the idea of Jewish involvement. He compared Kirk’s death to the death of Jesus, which he blamed on “a bunch of guys sitting around eating hummus, thinking about: ‘What do we do about this guy telling the truth about us? We must make him stop talking.’” He was widely condemned by Jewish groups for doing so, including by a rabbi in Kirk’s home state of Arizona, who called it “bigoted blood libel”.“Carlson is very polished in that sense,” says Derek Beres, co-host of the Conspirituality podcast and expert in conspiracies and media literacy. “He’ll say the thing without saying the thing so he gets an out. That was straight up blood libel.”What is notable about the way the right is responding to Kirk’s death is the opportunism – initially Laura Loomer tried to blame “a trans terror cell”, then Steve Bannon suggested “there’s a vast conspiracy … potentially involving the Chinese Communist party”, while Trump and Vance went after the left. They kept floating targets hoping that one will stick.Everything I’ve seen over the last two weeks has been disgusting – the level of merch, the recruitment drivesDerek BeresIn a moment when Israel’s genocide in Gaza is leading to more open public criticism of Zionism – Owens is capitalising. She continually refers to “Zionists” controlling the media and Kirk’s speech while he was alive.“One thing about Candace is that she’s an opportunist – at every stage. She started off on the left, and since then she’s figured out different ways of getting attention. I don’t find any moral centre in her. There’s no consistency, it’s about whatever is going to get eyeballs on ‘me’,” says Beres. He says most rightwing podcasters are “vultures” trying to have their piece of Kirk’s legacy.“Everything I’ve seen over the last two weeks has been disgusting – the level of merch, the recruitment drives – all of it is craven opportunism. Turning Point USA are continuing Kirk’s scheduled college tour with all these people – Megyn Kelly, Tucker Carlson, Vivek Ramaswamy, Alex Clark – and they are all trying to cosplay Kirk to keep it going. Every one of them is going to look for their own angle.”The second Trump presidency has brought waves of constant disinformation and a new era of conspiracy, making it hard to trust any source including the government. Add in the history of political assassinations in the US and abroad, which is ripe with plots and government contract killings, and this is a particularly exploitable moment for conspiracy theorists. Many people on the left and right find the text messages sent between Robinson, the Kirk shooting suspect, and his roommate, and subsequently released by prosecutors in Utah, suspicious. Owens has claimed the messages are “so federally written” and that these are “obnoxious messages that someone strung together”, that there is a “federal level of corruption and conspiracy involved in this murder”.Even Beres says he is keeping his mind open. “I don’t know how the guy spoke or how he wrote,” he says. “That said, the idea that I’d trust an agency run by Kash Patel and Dan Bongino is absurd. I don’t trust any of that information, there’s no reason to. Between Trump’s ear and this kid coming out of nowhere, I can’t say I’m 100% certain there isn’t something going on. When you’re in an accelerationist, shock-doctrine environment, the whole point is you can’t really trust any of the information coming out.”Explore more on these topicsCharlie Kirk shootingFar right (US)PodcastingPodcastsDigital mediaThe far rightGun crimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

There’s something else new in the EU’s only one-party state: politics has returned.For 15 years, Viktor Orbán’s electoral victories have been a foregone conclusion. But a credible political challenger to Orbán has appeared. Péter Magyar is no messiah: in fact, he is a defector from the ruling Fidesz party. Butpolls show Magyarand his new-ish pro-western Tisza movement are on course to defeat Orbán in April elections.Such an outcome would not just be a big deal for Hungarians. After years of Orbán’s obstructionism within the EU, its future, and that of European democracy more broadly, is also at stake.Hungary is what Hungarian political analysts such as Péter Krekó call an“informational” autocracy. This means Orbánism deploys more artful ways to gag critics and maintain its grip than locking people up.Spinning populist narratives to turn public opinion against “liberal elites” is at the heart of how Orbán has maintained far-right populist rule for 15 years – at the expense, many would say, of the rule of law and democracy, even beyond Europe.Orbán’s model – curtailing the independent media and fighting culture wars, while slicing away constitutional checks and balances – may have provided Donald Trump with a blueprint for the assault he is accused of launching on the democratic system in the US.“I watched it happen in Hungary, now it’s happening here,” an ex-US ambassador to Hungarywarned in a New York Times columnrecently.Democracy Noir, a new Connie Field documentary about Orbán, is being talked about as essential viewing for Americans because of the parallels it highlights between the Trump and Orbán methods.Repackaged Maga ideology is nowboosting Europe’s insurgent partieson the populist right, in a remarkable feedback loop. Andrej Babiš, an ally of both Orbán and Marine Le Pen in France, is tipped for a return to power in the Czech Republic next month. Poland recently elected anationalist president. And in the UK all eyes are on Nigel Farage’s Reform.Orbánism is seen by many as the connecting thread.Backlash in Europe’s populism laboratoryView image in fullscreenPéter Magyar, leader of the Tisza party, addresses supporters in Kötcse – emerging as the strongest rival to Viktor Orbán in years.Photograph: Bernadett Szabó/ReutersThe Central European University could stand as a monument to Hungary’s fate as a laboratory for reversing democracy. Once a symbol of academic freedom and liberal thought in post-communist eastern Europe, its Budapest campus has no students. In 2017,Orbán passed a lawforcing the George Soros-affiliated institution into exile.The former lecture halls were busy last week though, as the capital’s progressive mayor Gergely Karácsony – a thorn in Orbán’s side – hosted a “democracy forum” and warned politicians from elsewhere in Europe to start defeating “the narratives that make people support populists”. Whether Hungarians themselves are ready for non-populist answers to their problems remains to be seen.“Orbán fatigue” is prevalent, according to the academic Zsuzsanna Szelényi, a former politician, even in the PM’s rural voter base. But the urgent issue for most people is the economy. Orbán is increasingly viewed as out of touch, with a growing gap between his conspiratorial, EU-baiting public discourse and people’s day-to-day conversations, which are dominated by high food prices, healthcare and endemic corruption.While a backlash against the cronyist “Orbán system”, in whicholigarchs run much of the economy, is not new, what is new is opposition energy. “We have had a leadership crisis for 15 years and that is over. That is what gives Magyar a chance,” said Szelényi.Katalin Cseh, an opposition MP, whose own party has decided not to contest the election to maximise chances of Orbán being unseated, agrees that Magyar’s centre-right policies are ill defined. “But we share a strong belief in restoring democracy and ending systemic corruption,” she said.Weakened… but don’t write him offOrbán has won four consecutive elections by a landslide. Underestimating him would be foolhardy.Nevertheless, Krekó, director of the independent Political Capital thinktank, detects a crack in the “total confidence” that has long typified the regime.Orbán’s attempt to ban Budapest Pride in June backfired. The march was the biggest ever,thanks in part to Karácsony– a massive show of rainbow flags and anti-government defiance.Krekó also cites a Fidesz wobble over a “chilling, draconian” bill that would have blacklisted organisations with any foreign connections. It has been put on hold, one theory suggests, because of internal Fidesz concerns that it could backfire on them.“This shows the government is weaker than before; the economic situation is dire; in opinion polls it is lagging behind Tisza; diplomatically within the EU its lack of allies has become quite desperate,” Krekó said.Yet, Orbán commands a formidable armoury. A suite of generous exchequer-funded enticements, such as top-ups for pensioners and tax cuts for mothers of two children or more, can be expected.“In 2022, Fidesz spent 6% of Hungary’s GDP in transfers which people received before the elections. A lot of women and nobody under 25 pays income tax any longer. We can expect more of the same this time,” Szelényi said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the 2018 election, fears were whipped up by linkingrefugees to terrorism. This time, it is Ukrainians; Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s face appearing as an enemy alongside Ursula von der Leyen on posters. Magyar is implausibly portrayed as an agent of Kyiv.“Orbán’s methodology is all about narratives and storytelling and threats and emotions,” Szelényi said. “Interestingly, migration is no longer discussed. By 2019 it was a non-issue because, of course, in Hungary we need migrants.” State-sponsored agencies have quietly recruited hundreds of thousands of migrants from the Philippines and Vietnam to fill job vacancies.Game ofdronesView image in fullscreenA still photo published by Swedish armed forces of a Russian MiG-31 fighter jet that took part in a 12-minute violation of Estonian airspace.Photograph: Swedish Armed Forces/ReutersOrbán’s head-spinning geopolitical contortions – simultaneously friends with Trump, the Kremlin and China – could work against him, or help him remain in power.Hungary is a Nato member state.Russian military provocations, such as theincursion by Russian fighter jetsinto Estonia’s airspace, could make Orbán’s proximity to Putin awkward to defend. Even Trump is now saying Nato shouldshoot down Russian aircraft.Some Hungarians, including Karácsony, would like an end to Orbán’s ambivalence on Russia. “My great-grandparents were taken away to forced labour camps by Russian soldiers and they never returned alive. There are many such stories engraved in the soul of Hungarians,” he said.On the other hand, energy deals keep cheap Russian oil and gas flowing – for now – to Hungarian consumers.Trump may be wary of Hungary’s ties to China. But Orbán’s courting of Beijing guarantees investment, while “China gets a Trojan horse in the European Union” in exchange, Katalin Cseh said.The fight to shape the narrativeIn the claustrophobic basement rooms of Budapest’s Terror House – where visitors get the Fidesz-approved narrative of 20th-century Hungarian history – avideo plays on a loop: it is a leaner, younger Orbán, delivering a speech about the evils of foreign invaders, to rapturous applause.Szelényi knew Orbán well in the 1990s, when they were both in the early Fidesz leadership team and the party was on the liberal-centre. She quit as he radicalised the party, but remembers his reaction to defeat in the 2002 election. “That’s when he became very angry; he thought it was unjust, and the fault of the liberal elites in the media. It became a kind of bug in his head.”Now that his Christian nationalist ideas have made him the spiritual leader of a global Maga movement, would he accept electoral defeat at home? She has a hard time imagining it. “Orbán does not want defeat. He has completely reorganised the Fidesz campaign and has put himself in the lead.”New EU rulesprohibiting political advertising on social media come into effect next month, but Fidesz is organising its own online army, to spread the Orbán message in so-called digital “fighters clubs”. Szelényi sighs, contemplating the battle for control of the narrative. Whoever can seize it, will win, she said.“It will be a brutal campaign.”To receive the complete version of This Is Europe in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsThis is EuropeEuropeViktor OrbánHungarynewslettersShareReuse this content"

As it was, on the morning of 11 August, she found herself bent double in a trench, awaiting the next onslaught.It arrived after dawn. She aimed her ancient AK-47 at the pickup trucks racing towards her. Rockets screeched overhead. Suicide drones the size of light aircraft loomed above. Shells rained down.A nearby row of mud-brick homes vanished. The blasts came closer. Too close. Abdelghaffa was blown backwards. Her neck was wet with blood.The mother of five was carried from the frontline: El Fasher’s ambulances had run out of fuel months earlier. Someone pressed a rag on the 75-year-old’s neck. Bandages, too, were exhausted. There was no medicine either.“We couldn’t lose Mariam. She was our oldest fighter,” says Fatima Ali.Across the city, Sāra Bakhit crouched beside artillery near the disused airport. She ordered suppressive fire to prevent the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) overwhelming Abdelghaffa’s position.Q&AWhat is happening in Sudan?ShowFighting broke outin Khartoum, Sudan’s capital, on 15 April 2023 as an escalating power struggle between the two main factions of the military regime finally turned deadly.On one side are the Sudanese armed forces, who remain broadly loyal to Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the country’s de facto ruler. Against him are the paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a collection of militias who follow the former warlordGen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti.The RSF was initially founded by the former dictatorial ruler Omar al-Bashir as an Arab counterinsurgency militia called theJanjaweed, which quickly became synonymous with widespread atrocities. In 2013, Bashir transformed the group into the RSF, deploying them to crush a fresh rebellion in South Darfur.The conflict has plunged Sudan into“one of the worst humanitarian nightmares in recent history”, according to UN officials. It has created theworld’s worst displacement crisis, scattering more than 10 million people internally and 4 million who have fled into neighbouring countries, putting mounting pressure on Chad and South Sudan.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Famous for her gap-toothed perma-grin, the 43-year-old single mother was an El Fasher legend, the survivor of more than 150 battles. If she fell, everyone agreed, so would the city.“But the fighting is getting very dangerous. Their snipers constantly target me,” she says.Reports indicated the RSF was advancing south, deeper into the city, in its push to capture theSudanmilitary’s final stronghold in the Darfur region. Women were abducted. Others, executed on the spot. “We fight to survive. We have no choice but to protect our families,” says Bakhit.A map showing Sudan and th areas controlled by different forcesFor six hours the battle swung to and fro.

In May 2024, the UNwarnedit teetered on the “brink of famine”. No aid has entered since.The August battle that wounded Abdelghaffa was the RSF’s 228th attempt to seize the city.The struggle for El Fasher remains the defining showdown of Sudan’scataclysmic warbetween its army and the RSF. Victory for the RSF means total control over western Sudan, cleaving the vast nation in half.Somehow, against all odds, El Fasher has not fallen. Its defenders – a hotchpotch of volunteers like Abdelghaffa, rebels such as Bakhit and a depleted infantry battalion – have been shoehorned into a shrinking slice of the pulverised city with 260,000 trapped residents, half of them children.“It’s a medieval siege; something you’d expect in the middle ages,” says Sheldon Yett of Unicef.Yet aid has not entered for nearly 18 months. The reason, according to leaked documents, intelligence sources and senior UN officials, raises profound questions over the international community’s priorities.The evidence indicates a key US and UK ally intervened to effectively derail lifesaving humanitarian aid entering El Fasher.TheUnited Arab Emirates(UAE) intruded at a critical stage; hundreds of children are believed to have since died from starvation in the city.The US state department officials have directly implored the petrostate to back a pause in fighting and allow aid into El Fasher.Senior UN humanitarian officials also negotiated directly – to no avail.The UAE,repeatedly accused of supplying arms to the RSF, denies it supports the group.Informed sources monitoring the crisis claim that one of the longest urban sieges of modern warfare has only been possible because of such backing.“The UAE is the lifeline to the siege. Without its support, the RSF would have called it off.”Intelligence assessments indicate that the RSF is bent on ethnic cleansing should El Fasher fall. Model scenarios forecast thousands will be massacred.The assessments confirmed the RSF wanted to overrun the city during the rainy season, which started in early June and brought cloud, which the aggressors knew would make it harder for satellites to capture war crimes.And as the June skies above El Fasher darkened, Abdelghaffa was summoned to the city’s northern front. RSF reinforcements were massing. The endgame had begun.June 20252 JuneVulnerable people exposed to famine and deathView image in fullscreenA UN truck carrying aid to El Fasher destroyed by an RSF drone attack.Photograph: X/PresstvExtraA convoy trundled across north Darfur’s desert, three hours from El Fasher. Fifteen trucks: each driver as nervous as the next. No truck had reached the city since April 2024.Four thousand kilometres north, David Lammy – then UK foreign secretary – was holding court at a five-star hotel in Marrakech, Morocco. Earlier, he had unveiled the UK’s new approach to Africa, yet one country now held his attention.Castigating the world for its “ambivalence” towards Sudan’s war, Lammy confirmed it as the world’s “worst humanitarian catastrophe”.Ground zero was El Fasher, and the situation was about to worsen. Shortly after Lammy’s speech, the Darfur convoy wasdevastated by an airstrike. In El Fasher, the news brought despair.Abdessalam Kitir, 50, who lived near the university with his wife and son, says: “It confirmed we were on our own.

Food supplies soon dried to a trickle. More fighters were needed. “I had no option. To the front I must go,” she told her friend Ibrahim Ahmed.The RSF, the latest iteration of theArab militias who perpetrated the genocide, had embarked on a recruitment surge. Thousands of their fighters encircled the city. Keeping them at bay was getting harder. The attackers wielded hi-tech weaponry which, sources allege, was being flown into Nyala, 120 miles (193km) south.The nearest advancing friendly forces were 350 miles east. Their ranks included Bakhit’s youngest son. “He will come to liberate us,” she laughs.Unlike Abdelghaffa, Bakhit had fought before. She had battled Darfur’s Arab militias as a teenager. Later, they had killed her husband. The RSF was even responsible for her trademark grin: a fighter had jabbed his rifle into her mouth.View image in fullscreenSāra Bakhit, who is fighting to defend El Fasher.Photograph: Sāra BakhitThe 214th attack on El Fasher concentrated onAbu Shouk, the immense displacement camp at the city’s northern edge. It was the biggest for months. “They had new weapons. The whole city shook,” says Adam Mohammed, a resident.Howitzers obliterated homes. Suicide drones approached from the east. Fighters advanced.Abdelghaffa could not let Abu Shouk fall, a safe haven for those who had fled the genocide. Plus it held El Fasher’s final functioning market, Naivasha, where supplies were down to five sacks of millet.A zoomed in map showing key points within the cityAt 5pm the RSF withdrew. Abdelghaffa’s unit of volunteers had defended the market – for another day, at least.Kitir heard the guns fall silent. A former official for the UN’s dissolved Darfur peacekeeping operation, he did not abandon the city he cherished.But another long night lay ahead. Staples such as sorghum had almost disappeared. Most community kitchens were closing: there was nothing to cook. Children ate locusts. Well-connected individuals like Kitir sporadically acquired meat, but it was getting harder.

There were candid warnings ofethnic cleansing.Anemergency sessionof the UN security council (UNSC) on Sudan was called. El Fasher was careering towards cataclysm. Malnourished children were dying daily.Some diplomats felt the siege was not being taken seriously. “Where was the action? The urgency?” says one.A UNSC resolution had urged an end to the siege, but that was a year ago. The noose around El Fasher’s neck had since tightened.Concern was mounting over the UK’s approach. As council “penholder” on Sudan, it was responsible for galvanising global response.Yet Russia had vowed to veto any UK resolution, negating its influence. A solution was engineered. Representing Africa, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Algeria offered to look after Sudan.The UK refused to cede control. “The UK was providing political cover for the UAE,” alleges a UN investigator. Silencing the security council on El Fasher, they claim, blocked scrutiny of the UAE’s role. Jenny Chapman, development minister, said the UK used its position at the UN and elsewhere to “apply diplomatic pressure”.27 JuneEmirati investments versus starving childrenView image in fullscreenShayna Lewis, a Sudan specialist, briefs the UN security council meeting on 27 June.Photograph: Loey Felipe/UN PhotoAnother UN security council session on Sudan was called. Internal pressure was growing to secure a reprieve for El Fasher. Inside the city, families had started chewing leaves to survive. Presenting evidence to the council was Sudan specialistShayna Lewis. Days earlier she had returned from the country, enraged.Without naming the UK, Lewis condemned the complicity of states “who continue to prioritise Emirati investments” over El Fasher’s starving families.Where, she wondered, was the council’s conscience? A year earlier, discussions involved UN troops in Darfur forcing their way into El Fasher if needed. States privately discussed sanctioning the UAE.Now, ambitions had lowered. The UNSC settled on pursuing a week-long humanitarian pause.Lewis left the UN’s headquarters deflated. Convinced genocide was impending, she feared the council was “satisfied issuing statements”.30 JuneSecret negotiations take placeThe UN’s humanitarian pause was rejected by the RSF. To reinforce this, rockets pounded El Fasher. RSF fighters stormed towards the centre, reaching Tijaniya Mosque.In the north, Abdelghaffa held her position. Bakhit’s artillery helped push back the attackers. Throughout, the mother of three was targeted by snipers.Despite the RSF’s public rejection of a humanitarian pause, internal documents reveal a different story.A secret meeting at an undisclosed location occured between US and UN officials and chief RSF negotiator, Brig Gen Omar Hamdan.The meeting was considered a triumph. Hopes soared that aid would shortly be allowed into El Fasher.Documents state: “While no formal commitment was made regarding the pause in El Fasher, RSF leadership indicated the proposal would be reviewed internally. A response would follow pending further consultations.”Such consultations, said sources, would involve the UAE. Previously, the Emiratis had stated support for humanitarian pauses.Optimism was so high that UN officials felt it was now a question of when, not if.Articulating the mood, one document adds that “in anticipation of the pause in El Fasher,” preparations are to immediately begin to “strategically preposition critical relief supplies across key locations in Darfur to enable rapid deployment”.Convoys laden with aid for El Fasher were readied.July2 JulyLondon silent as new burial mounds revealedView image in fullscreenThe then foreign secretary David Lammy speaking at the Africa Debate in London on 2 July.Photograph: Ben Dance/FCDOA capacity crowd squeezed into London’s Guildhall for a keynoteAfrica speechby David Lammy.

Abdelghaffa and Bakhit survived on a single daily serving.At this stage, academics believed El Fasher’s population was likely enduring unprecedented levels of starvation.Unpublished provisional data documenting the impact of alengthy siege in Jebel Aulia, central Sudan, detected “extremely elevated” levels of malnutrition, higher than ever previously documented there.11 JulyHungry defenders are outnumberedDaylight heralded another offensive, this time from the south. Lookouts confirmed that the 220th attempt to seize the city was the biggest yet.Bakhit tried forcing the attackers back, but the city’s hungry defenders were outpowered and outnumbered.“So much new weaponry was arriving at El Fasher that even the RSF was overwhelmed by the pace of its arrival,” says an arms investigator.For seven hours the RSF advanced, capturing the cattle market, prison and a military headquarters. By mid afternoon, the attackers were only a mile from Bakhit.Dusk fell; the RSF retreated. Bakhit viewed this as a hollow victory. The attack was the first time the RSF had invaded her city in sizeable numbers since the siege began.In London and Washington, real-time satellites had tracked the incursion. The assessment from analysts was ominous.A security source says: “El Fasher was wobbling. How long could it hang on?”15 JulyHumiliation, torture and executionThe siege deepened. Anyone leaving or entering El Fasher was apprehended. Traders were whipped and beaten. Some were humiliated: forced to jive to Arab music or “baa” like sheep. Others were simply executed.Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is alink to the videoinstead.Two videos show RSF fighters humiliating civilians – videoInside the city, Kitir endured the constant shelling. Any fledgling hopes of fleeing with his family faded. All he could do was wait for help that might never materialise.“We will never, ever escape,” he says.Bakhit, meanwhile, insisted victory was achievable. “We will win this!” she told everyone she met.Two decades ago, she had met the then UN secretary-general Kofi Annanin Darfuras the west rallied to safeguard survivors of the genocide.Bakhit wondered why the world wouldn’t come to their rescue again. Regardless, she was prepared to fight to the death.She had no inkling that, three hours away in Nyala, help for El Fasher was being assembled. In a central warehouse, 28 trucks waited with medical equipment and food for 100,000 people. A UN source says: “We were all set. What was the hold up?”18 JulyFood aid for 40,000 people is destroyedFinally, the RSF responded to demands for a humanitarian pause. Hopes of a reprieve for El Fasher shrivelled. A written response from the group concluded aid into the city was “not feasible”.A shred of hope, however, emerged from the RSF correspondence: it was willing to open humanitarian corridors to facilitate the “safe exit of civilians”.Was it a trap? Intelligence indicated the RSF believed “no more civilians” remained in El Fasher. It also wanted to kill every fighter.In Nyala, the convoy was partly disassembled. Significant quantities of aid had spoiled: food for 40,000 people was destroyed.27 JulyRSF walls in the cityAround El Fasher, satellites observed something odd sprouting from the desert. Imposing earthworks – at least 9 miles long – encircling the city.The city was beingwalled inby the RSF. Access to El Fasher was increasingly restricted to a 50-yard gap between the berms where RSF guards executed passersby.View image in fullscreenAbdessalam Kitir“It is like a moat. Entering the city has become forbidden,” says Kitir. Even less food was entering the city: ambaz was becoming scarce. The shelling, meanwhile, was getting heavier. His neighbours joined first aid classes in case relatives were hit.While the giant berms stopped food getting in, they also prevented people leaving. People were shot scrambling over the earthworks at night. A “kill box” suffocated the city.“Anyone who leaves is abducted, robbed or worse. We have no choice but to stay,” says Kitir.But staying meant starvation. El Fasher’s fate had been effectively decided at another secret meeting days earlier. UN officials had again met RSF negotiator Hamdan, pleading for a show of clemency.Hamdan’s mood had hardened. Lingering hopes of a humanitarian pause were dashed. Allowing aid in, said Hamdan, was now “untenable”.August3 AugustRSF hire mercenaries to increase their firepowerAttempts to overrun El Fasher became international. Foreign fighters congregated outside its periphery. Bakhit says she witnessed Libyans, Ethiopians and Colombians alongside the RSF. Friends reported they had heard shouting in Spanish.Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is alink to the videoinstead.Fighters purported to be Colombian mercenaries shoot near an El Fasher mosqueRSF reinforcements poured in from the Sahel, too. Inside El Fasher, the worst time was the pre-bombardment calm, says Kitir.“Everybody fears the first shell – the bomb of the martyrs. So unpredictable. After, everybody finds cover.”Cover meant trenches. Everyone crouched in them, counting the shells, for hours at a time. Kitir became adept at distinguishing the sounds of the weaponry deployed to kill him: the booming of an AH-4 howitzer, the scream of Katyusha rocket launchers.But it was the suicide drones that most shredded the nerves. Day and night they buzzed above his neighbourhood.7 AugustThe ‘safe passage’ trapIt was a trap. The RSF’s promise of safe passage was precisely the opposite. Entire groups who made a break for freedom were murdered. A party of 50 civilians was abducted.Sporadic footage surfaced of atrocities. The most notorious involved a Naivasha market restaurateur, executed by an RSF officer. Kitir knew his neighbour. He left behind a young son.The little food on sale was prohibitively expensive: seven times higher than usual.Priced out, Kitir turned to ambaz. He sent an image of a bowl he shared with his chickens.Priced out of the market, Abdessalam Kitir turned to ambaz. Here is an image of a bowl he shared with his chickens.Photograph: Abdessalam KitirBakhit worried where her next meal was coming from.The shelling worsened, running continuously from 10am to 6pm. Kitir waited in the trenches, counting the bombs. “Between 200 and 300 at a time, all targeting civilian areas.”10 AugustNo reprieveFaced with overwhelming evidence that the RSF was readying to overrun El Fasher, senior UN officials agreed they had to pressure those the RSF obeyed: the Emirates.Documents confirm “intensified” diplomatic pressure directed towards the UAE.The US came fully on board. Senior state department figures, includingPeter Lord, implored officials from UAE’s ministry of foreign affairs to lift the siege.Lord knew what was at stake. Second in command of the bureau ofAfrican affairs, his previous role was senior adviser for Sudan.Lord understood the potential for genocide should the RSF take El Fasher.But the US’s efforts – described as “sustained pressure” in documents – yielded no late reprieve.Increasingly exasperated, the US wanted the RSF and army in the same room. A summit on Sudan was arranged for Geneva, Switzerland. There, US officials would meet UAE representatives in another attempt to secure clemency for El Fasher.Far from acquiescing, documents reveal that the UAE appears to have actively intervened to thwart prospects of a humanitarian pause for the besieged city. The UAE declined to comment.Instead of supporting aid into El Fasher, the UAE advocated tying the city’s predicament to the agreement of a series of other humanitarian pauses for besieged towns inneighbouring Kordofan.The plan all but killed off help for El Fasher. The UAE’s suggestion meant a significantly more onerous, complex strategy was required.“UAE informally indicated that there may be more traction if El Fasher and Kordofan were discussed as a set – ie the RSF could be seen as ‘having lost the political game’ if they allow the pause to happen only in El Fasher,” the documents reveal.Digesting the Emiratis’ intervention, UN officials reluctantly began identifying “operationally viable locations” within Kordofan, a process that meant new negotiations with no guarantee of success.Cajoling the Emirates was seen by many as the last throw of the dice. Help for El Fasher had never felt so elusive.11 AugustAttack on Abu ShoukView image in fullscreenDisplaced people from El Fasher are transported to Tawila.Photograph: Jérome TubianaVolley after volley of artillerypounded the flimsy homes in Abu Shouk. Hundreds of residents, many carrying children, streamed south. Abdelghaffa waited near the market. Dozens of RSF pickups sped south, shooting at residents crawling away.Abdelghaffa was injured and had to be carried towards the airport. Two of her children were among 19 wounded. When the RSF withdrew, more than 50 civilians lay dead amid the camp’s ruins.13 AugustAid convoys restocked as hopes riseThe attack on Abu Shouk – a blatant violation of international law – focused the attention of the UNSC. A councilstatementagain urged an end to the siege and confirmed the RSF was deliberately targeting civilians. No fresh sanctions, however, were directed against the RSF’s leadership.In Nyala, the convoy for El Fasher was restocked. Blind optimism according to some, but expectations were galvanised by the prospect of talks in Geneva the following day.Hopes quickly curdled: neither the RSF or Sudanese armyturned up.In El Fasher, Bakhit visited Al Saudi hospital where Abdelghaffa was recuperating. “I offered Mariam my support for a full recovery.”Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is alink to the videoinstead.Mariam Abdelghaffa, the oldest soldier in El Fasher, says she was hit in the neckBakhit was worried whether Abdelghaffa would survive. With no medicines, not even painkillers, any injury could prove fatal.“We use herbal medicines, leaves – and lots of praying,” says Ibrahim Suleman, who lives in the city.The last functional hospital was bustling. “Constant shelling meant many civilians suffered,” says Bakhit.But the biggest killer did not fall from above. Youngsters were “dying immediately” from starvation says regional expertHala Al-Karib. Nutritional supplements for children expired months earlier.Rates of miscarriage were “very high” she adds. Childbirth was becoming a death sentence.17 AugustUN hatches audacious aid ployAttention turned to the skies. The UN explored using its humanitarian air service to drop aid over El Fasher. The possibility of enrolling the Jordanian air force, fresh from its airdropsover Gaza, was floated.The obstacle was anti-aircraft missile systems scanning the skies above El Fasher.The RSF warned that UN aircraft were legitimate targets. “They refused us safe passage,” says a UN source.At any rate, the need was massive. “You can’t airdrop your way out of a situation like El Fasher: a plane holds a fraction of a truck’s capacity,” says the source.Humanitarian officials were frantic. Could the RSF be deceived somehow? An audacious plot was hatched. With the RSF’s consent, aid trucks would travel into Darfur but not to El Fasher.In reality, their cargo was destined for the besieged city.20 AugustStarvation and the frontlineThe convoy reached Mellit – 56 miles north of El Fasher – around lunchtime. The RSF must have suspected something. Soon after, a drone thudded into the convoy, destroying three of the 16 trucks.Undeterred, the plan went ahead. A network of smugglers started lugging the surviving aid south.But could they navigate the gauntlet of berms, kill squads and checkpoints that lay ahead?Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is alink to the videoinstead.'Nothing enters El Fasher': RSF fighters stop a man carrying foodInside El Fasher, ambazwas sought after like a delicacy. Residents eked it out with water. Kitir ate grass that sprouted in the streets. Others chanced a foul juice made from leaves calleduqtulni– “kill me”. Stomach cramps were guaranteed.A family of six died in their sleep after consuming food waste. Naivasha market limped on. Rice hit £50 a kilo. A sack of ambaz sold for £110. Desperation thrived.Abdelghaffa recovered – and immediately returned to Abu Shouk’s frontline.She was busy. The RSF were pushing further into the displacement camp. Targeted relentlessly by drones, the decision was taken to fall back.It was the same story across the city. To the south, defenders retreated from the livestock market, scene of much bloodshed. Units on the eastern axis gave ground.El Fasher’s fall felt inevitable.27 August500 days of siegeFive hundred days since the siege began, El Fasher’s nightmare continued to worsen.Inconceivably, the shelling intensified. Between 700 and 1,000 shells fell daily. Bakhit’s neighbour’s home was flattened.Kitir spent whole days in the trenches. To the north, near Abdelghaffa’s position, RSF snatch squads crept closer, abducting dozens of women and children. None were seen again.Much of Abu Shouk was now controlled by the RSF. Outside the city, the RSF kept building berms. El Fasher was entirely encircled.UN humanitarians, though, refused to concede defeat, haranguing the RSF. It was like screaming into the void. One says: “We reached stalemate. Nothing is going to give.”September4 SeptemberOne-off aid convoy gets throughFood unexpectedly arrives in El Fasher. “The situation is suddenly much better,” says a buoyant Kitir. He even predicted prices might fall.Residents were baffled at the influx. But the UN’s secret ploy had worked.It was a brief reprieve. UN officials knew there could be no repeat. From now, El Fasher was on its own.In London, Lammyentertainedan Emirati delegation. It was one of his final acts as foreign secretary. A day later he was gone.15 SeptemberHope is abandonedAny pretence that help might reach El Fasher was entirely abandoned. Accepting impending annihilation, the military had planted a minefield around its territory.A humanitarian pause was now impossible. “The de-mining you’d need to deliver aid would be massive and time-consuming,” says a UN source. “You need a full ceasefire that no one will agree to.”Inside El Fasher, the mood was remarkably upbeat. Abandoned, its residents invested faith in their own people to save them.Bakhit was convinced her son’s battalion – 300 miles to the east – would arrive to save them. “He will come. Watch!” she laughed. Kitir felt similarly sanguine. “The people are very optimistic for our advancing fighters.”22 SeptemberOn their ownWorld leaders gathered in New York for the UN general assembly. Several debates on El Fasher are planned. Too little, too late.The city’s defences werecrumbling. With the rains almost over, the RSF launched its most ferocious offensive yet.Naivasha market fell. Attackers stormed a key military base, headquarters of former peacekeeping force UNAMID. Abu Shouk, home to 190,000 genocide survivors, was overrun. Families streamed south, desperate for shelter.Backed by newly arrived drones, entire neighbourhoods were devastated. Kitir’s house was struck by a shell, collapsing his ceiling. A mosque next door was obliterated. Bodies of friends were strewn across his street.Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.

RSF fighters are 600 yards from their oor. “These days are very difficult,” says Kitir.Nearby, Bakhit is fighting around the clock, hemmed in as attackers advance from three sides.In the pandemonium, Abdelghaffa disappeared. Repeated attempts to locate her have failed. Last sightings suggest she ventured north, clutching her rifle, to defend Abu Shouk.“It was her duty,” says friend Zubaida Ahmadi. “She knew there was nobody coming to help us.”Maybe, somehow, the grandmother is still out there, refusing to budge, fighting with every last breath for her doomed home.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentSudanAfricaConflict and armsUnited Arab EmiratesWar crimesDavid LammyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

About two-thirds of nearly 11 million eligible voters registered to vote and, of those, 76% voted.Mutharika’s resounding victory marks the third election in a row that power has changed hands in Malawi. Chakwera had defeated Mutharika inthe last ballot, known as the “Tipp-Ex election”, which was re-run in 2020 after judges ruled that outcomes had beenchanged using correctional fluid.Sex work and abuse: the women trapped in Malawi’s growing refugee campRead moreMutharika, a former law professor, was accused by the country’s anti-corruption agency in 2018 of receiving a $200,000 kickback from a multimillion-dollar contract to supply food to the police. He was cleared of charges, which had prompted protests, and said he thought the money was an “honest donation” to his party.“When Peter Mutharika was governing in the first term, things did not go so well. For him to come back with such an emphatic win … it shows you how badly Chakwera has done,” said Victor Chipofya, a political science lecturer at Blantyre International University.Malawi’s economy never really recovered from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. For the past three years,inflation has been above 20%and the economy has grownmore slowly than the population. Meanwhile, a scarcity of foreign exchange has led to regular shortages of fuel, fertiliser and medicine.Some of this has been due toclimate disasters. Since the last election, the country of 21 million has been hit with multiple cyclones, including Cyclone Freddy, which killed more than 1,000 people in 2023. Last year, there was adevastating drought.The southern African country, which had an average annual income of just $508 in 2024according to the World Bank, has also been badly affected by aid cuts. AnIFPRI studyin April estimated that US aid will fall 59% this year, slashing 1% from Malawi’s GDP.Malawi set to run out of TB drugs in a month after US, UK and others cut aidRead moreMalawi, whose major export is tobacco, has also long imported more than it exports. However, many researchers and economists have argued that the central bank made foreign exchange shortages worse by fixing the exchange rate against the US dollar. Theofficial exchange rateis 1734 kwacha to $1, but it is as high as 5,000 on the hidden market. The government contributed by pulling out of an IMF programme that was providing a 0% interest US dollar loan.Chipofya said: “Not that I agree personally with all the terms and conditions the IMF would bring, but as a country we need the IMF because without it then … other donors or development partners are not going to come in.”Malawi’s economic issues are so deep-rooted that Mutharika may be unable to improve on his longtime rival’s record, said Boniface Dulani, an associate professor of political science at the University of Malawi.“If there was an election that one would want to lose, then maybe this was one election to lose for Chakwera, because I don’t really think they are going to be able to turn things around,” he said.Explore more on these topicsMalawiAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The film’s title is inspired by the Peking University professor’s pioneering work –the “sponge city” concept– on how to help cities cope with extreme weather and floods in an era of climate change.Turning cities into sponges: how Chinese ancient wisdom is taking on climate changeRead moreYu used ancient Chinese water systems to reimagine modern architecture, building systems to help cities conserve and re-use rainwater. This helps to regulate water flows across monsoon and dry seasons. “It’s important to make friends with water,” he once said.Yu’s architecture firm, Turenscape, works in hundreds of cities across China. In one project on the outskirts of Beijing, Turenscape built holes in the banks of a river to slow the flow of water and create natural filtration pools.Beijing and other cities across China have suffered fromsevere floodingand rainfall this year, highlighting the need for urban adaptation to climate disasters to prevent densely populated areas from being overwhelmed.Turenscape recently picked up two awards from the American Society of Landscape Architects. It won atop prizefor a “floating forest” in Jiangxi province, which turned a 126-acre degraded landscape on the Yangtze River floodplain into an urban wetland that manages stormwater and restores natural habitats. The park was praised by the judges for offering a “template for other cities seeking to resuscitate blighted waterfront landscapes”.Yu and his companions were reportedly travelling to Fazenda Barra Mansa, a famous riversidehaciendawhere the Brazilian television giant Globo has filmed one of the country’s most famous soap operas, Pantanal.The Folha de Campo Grande, a local newspaper, said the pilot had been attempting to abort a landing when the plane lost altitude and fell “causing an immediate explosion” on the ground. Police chief Ana Cláudia Medinaconfirmedfour people had died in the incident and said officers had been sent to the remote crash site to investigate the causes.The Pantanal, which straddles the border region between Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay, is the world’s largest tropical wetland and one of South America’s most biodiverse regions. Home to hundreds of species of birds, fish and mammals, it is a popular tourist destination famed for the presence of animals such as the hyacinth macaw, the jaguar and the giant anteater.The celebrated Chinese landscape architect had recently participated in a conference organized by the Council of Architecture and Urbanism of Brazil in the country’s capital, Brasília, where he spoke about his “sponge city” philosophy. “[Cities must] retain water, slow down water, embrace water,” Yu said inan interview on the sidelines.The conference in September celebrated the 65th anniversary of the foundation of Brazil’s futuristic capital, created by the renowned architect Oscar Niemeyer and urban planner Lúcio Costa in the 1950s.“Bringing specialists such as Kongjian Yu is crucial so we can reflect on innovative solutions that can be applied to Brazilian cities, especially when it comes to urban sustainability and resilience, as well as learning from other cultures,” the council’s president, Patrícia Sarquis Herden, said on the eve of his arrival.On Chinese social media, fans of Yu expressed disbelief at the news. “How could Professor Yu Kongjian leave us so suddenly?” wrote one Weibo user.Brazil’s president​, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva​, voiced “sadness and consternation”. “During times of climate change, Kongjian Yu became a global reference for sponge cities, which combine quality of life and environmental protection: something we want​ – and need – for the future,” Lula said in a statement.Explore more on these topicsBrazilAmericasArchitecturenewsShareReuse this content"

Now they realise the degree to which the world’s superpower seems bent on the destruction of everything they believe.Immediately after the shocked, and even embarrassed, UN delegates had recovered from Trump’s performance, the general assembly was addressed by leaders of two large Muslim states, the Indonesian president, Prabowo Subianto, and the Turkish president,Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Subianto was strongly applauded when he asserted: “Might cannot be right; right must be right. No one country can bully the whole of the human family. We may be weak individually, but the sense of oppression and injustice will unite us into a strong force that will overcome this injustice.” Erdoğan insisted that the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was completely out of control, and those that were silent in the face of his barbarity were complicit.Brazil’s president says in UN speech that democracy can prevail over ‘would-be autocrats’Read moreAnd immediately prior to Trump’s address, the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, without mentioning the US, had givena sophisticated warning about the threat posed by the new authoritarians. “Today the ideals that inspired the UN’s founders in San Francisco are under threat as never before in their history. Multilateralism is at a new crossroads. This organisation’s authority is in check. We are witnessing the constellation of an international order marked by repeated concessions to power play. Attacks on sovereignty, arbitrary sanctions and unilateral interventions are becoming the rule.“There is a clear parallel between multilateralism’s crisis and the weakening of democracy. Authoritarianism is strengthened when we fail to act in the face of arbitrary acts when international society falters in defending peace and sovereignty. All around the world, anti-democratic forces are trying to subjugate institutions and suffocate freedoms. They worship violence, glorify ignorance, act as physical and digital militias, and restrict the press,” Lula said.Others, such as South Korea’s president, Lee Jae Myung, insisted that the climate crisis was far from being a hoax, and that it represents a threat to global humanityYet the Trump speech also made even more stark and urgent the unavoidable question of how the world will operate in the absence of reliable American leadership.This is not just a question for the global south, but also for Europe as it confronts Russia, for Asia as it wrestles with Chinese power and for the Gulf as it grapples with Israel’s military dominance. One response isthe alliance of autocrats on display in Beijing at the beginning of the month led by Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin.But another is the still forming anti-Trump alliance led by democratic leaders. This is operating apart from the UN, because the reality is that the UN institutions, gridlocked by the veto of competing power blocks, and abandoned financially by America, is being bypassed.The US president’s claim to have ended seven “unendable wars”, all without any help from the UN, is absurd, but it is true that the UN security council is no longer capable of bringing conflicts to an end. As Lula explained: “The tyranny of the veto sabotages the very reason for the UN’s existence.”In his speech, the UN secretary general,António Guterres, made a pitch for the UN’s continued relevance, but he acknowledged the pillars of peace and prosperity were buckling, and multilateralism was suffering. “Multipolarity without effective multilateral institutions courts chaos – as Europe learned the hard way resulting in world war one,” he said.By the end of his speech he was left to comfort himself by insisting “we must never give up”.But the efforts to develop a strong anti-Trumpian alliance bringing together the global south and Europe have been weakened by the issue of double standards – the belief that Europe’s outrage with Russia’s invasion ofUkraineis not matched by similar outrage at Israel’s destruction of Gaza.Pedro Sánchez, the Spanish prime minister, in a speech to 500Columbia Universitystudents on Monday, repeatedly warned his fellow Europeans to realise how much damage the double standards charge had caused to their image.Indeed, Sánchez is rapidly becoming the European leader most willing to stand in Trump’s way. At Columbia, he drew applause defending the positive virtues of migration and said: “Open societies are the best antidote to fanaticism” – remarks that had a special relevance given Trump’s attempts to silence the Columbia campus protests.He added: “When the voice of a society is silenced, it ends up dying. Open societies thrive on words. Freedom of expression, of belief, the right to participate in public life empowers citizens. Losing the freedom to dissent is opening the door to tyranny.”Trump tariffs are reshaping old alliances as the global south plots its own pathRead moreSánchez is also one of the front-rank politicians trying to build alliances to stand up to Trump, convening on Wednesday with Lula and Chile’s Gabriel Boric an alliance entitled In Defence of Democracy focusing on issues such as reinforcing multilateralism, the rule of law, and cooperation against extremism and the algorithms that weaken social cohesion.But these global alliances are still in their infancy and ill-coordinated.The greater danger is that each nation-state, driven by internal politics and assessments of their economic strength, will make their own decisions on how to combat, or bow, to American power.In making that decision, each country will know the strength of Trump’s shakedown diplomacy. Bymixing trade, security, or immigration into one negotiation, Trump maximises his leverage– and however much he is reviled, it is a brave country that resists.Explore more on these topicsUnited NationsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS foreign policyXi JinpingVladimir PutinBenjamin NetanyahuanalysisShareReuse this content"

This includes the senior official who gave the order, President Trump,” Petro said.The Trump administration last week decertified Colombia as an ally in the fight against drugs, but stopped short of economic sanctions.The countries are historical allies, but ties have soured under Petro – Colombia’s first-ever leftist leader.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsColombiaUnited NationsDonald TrumpAmericasVenezuelaCaribbeannewsShareReuse this content"

But I don’t think it is reformable.”Regenvanu’s comments came after Trump used his speech at the UN general assembly to call the climate crisis a “con job” and make thinly veiled threats against countries backing renewable energy projects, which he is dismantling in the US while boosting fossil-fuel production.The production and use of fossil fuels are driving the climate crisis, which is turbocharging deadly extreme weather including heatwaves, hurricanes, drought and wildfires across the US – none of which were mentioned in Trump’s climate denialist rant at the UN.In stark contrast, Vanuatu, an archipelago located east of northern Australia whose 330,000 inhabitants, culture, food sources and land are facing existential threats from the climate crisis, has a long history of leadership in climate diplomacy.Vanuatu began calls for a loss-and-damage fund in 1992 – which was finally established atthe 2023 Cop in Dubai– and was among the first countries to call for the recognition of ecocide as a fifth crime against humanity under the Rome statute. It was also among the first backers of the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty and then led the charge on the ICJ case after a group of law students lobbied the government in 2019.The ICJ judges found that 1.5C is a legally binding non-negotiable limit and all states are obliged to implement evidence-based measures to cut greenhouse-gas emissions to curtail global heating and protect the climate system.Fossil fuels are causing widespread harm to human health, ecosystems, the oceans and the climate, and government support for the production and consumption of oil, gas and coal through subsidies and licenses may “constitute an internationally wrongful act which is attributable to that state”, the advisory opinion found.“The fossil-fuel industry has captured everything, from politics, to the media, and general discourse. It is the power of the fossil-fuel industry that is the central power in the current world dynamic” and the biggest obstacle to tackling the climate crisis and implementation of the ICJ ruling, according to Regenvanu.The fossil-fuel industry spentat least $445m in the last US electioncycle to influence US politicians, especially Trump and Republicans. Since winning re-election and taking control of both Houses, Trump has slashed environmental regulations while his signature legislative package gives oil and gas firms$18bnin tax incentives.Trump’s actions are not limited to domestic policy.In recent months, the US, the largest historical greenhouse-gas emitter, has rescinded climate finance commitments that it owes, according to international law, to countries harmed by its dependence on fossil fuels. Trump has also withdrawn from key international forums including the UN climate talks and the International Maritime Organization (IMO), threatening to retaliate against international efforts to decarbonize shipping and transition to renewable energy sources.Amid unprecedented hostility from the US and widespread geopolitical tensions, Vanuatu is now working on a resolution to the UN that will likely be tabled after Cop30 in Belen, Brazil.The resolution is unlikely to be passed unanimously like the March 2023 Vanuatu resolution which led to the ICJ case, but is expected to gain the support of a large majority of countries and would be an important step in the ICJ findings becoming workable obligations.“We’re not getting anywhere with consensus-based decision-making because a few states can hold everyone else to ransom and stop new environmental safeguarding conventions like the plastic treaty, the universal levy on shipping and at Cop. The only place that’s kind of safe from that is the UN general assembly, where it’s a majority vote,” Regenvanu told the Guardian.“In certain forums it’s better the US isn’t there. We have less obstruction and less resistance in the room, so we can get more done … But look, every month there is another disaster in the US, people are already dying here. Eventually the day of reckoning will come for the US, and sooner or later something has to change.”Explore more on these topicsVanuatuClimate crisisParis climate agreementPacific islandsInternational court of justiceAsia PacificGreenhouse gas emissionsnewsShareReuse this content"

It follows the journey of a young couple who move to the countryside and encounter mysterious and grotesque changes to their bodies.In one scene, which features a wedding between two men, one of the men’s faces was altered to look like a woman’s. Cinemagoers in China only noticed the change when side-by-side screenshots of the scene circulated on social media.“AI face-swapping is really unacceptable – it completely changes the original creative vision,” wrote one social media user.Films have to be approved by China’s censorship authorities to be released on the mainland. For imported films, this often leads to scenes featuring themes that the government deems sensitive or racy being cut. But the use of technology to alter scenes rather than just cut them is relatively new. Some viewers complained that it made the censorship harder to spot.UK academics studying topics sensitive to China face harassment, survey findsRead more“What’s happening outside the film is even more terrifying than what’s shown in it,” wrote one Weibo user.Homosexuality is decriminalised in China but it is still widely stigmatised, with nuclear, heterosexual relationships promoted as the ideal norm. The government’s longstanding stance of “neither supporting nor opposing” homosexuality has given way inrecent yearsto acrackdownon LGBTQ+ groups. It is very rare to see same-sex relationships in mainstream films or television shows. In 2021, China’s television regulatorbanned“sissy men” from appearing on screen.But public opinion is increasingly supportive of LGBTQ identities.

It is the first time Beijing has committed to an absolute target to cut its emissions.Albanese told a climate conference hosted by the New York Times that China could do more, including closing coal-fired power stations, though he acknowledged China had beaten previous commitments.He credited US leadership with the creation of the international rules-based order, a system which he said had delivered generational economic transformation.“But we cannot ask – and should not expect – any one nation to uphold the rules or guarantee the security on which all of us depend,” Albanese said.“We all have a role to play in making sure that the system which has enabled the rise of new powers, safeguards the rights and aspirations of every nation big and small.”The prime minister said Australia would seek a temporary seat on the UN security council in 2029-30, a bid first launched bythe Turnbull government in 2015. If successful, it would be the first time since 2013-2014 Australia has sat on the council.In a rebuttal of Trump, Albanese called climate change an existential threat for low-lying Pacific countries. Trump told the general assembly this week that climate change was “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”.Albanese said the federal government was on track to meet its 2030 target of 43% emissions reduction on 2005 levels and called the 2035 targetof 62% to 70% ambitious and achievable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was the only foreign government minister in attendance.Photos obtained by Guardian Australia show Bowen and Erdoğan posing with other guests.Bowen also spoke to the president of Azerbaijan’s Cop29 summit, Mukhtar Babayev.Turkey is adamant its time has come to host the annual eventafter withdrawing from the race to host Cop26, which ultimately went to Glasgow.Any decision on the host country has to be made through consensus, or the event will default to Bonn in Germany.Both Bowen and Albanese have declined to discuss the status of negotiations with Turkey, but describe Australia’s support among partner countries as overwhelming. Australia has at least 23 votes among the critical 28-country Western European and Others Group whose turn it is to host the annual summit.“I’ve had good and positive conversations with Türkiye, and when there’s more to say, we’ll say,” Bowen told journalists a day before the event in New York.“We do want a very investment-focused Cop, on investing in Australia’s renewable energy superpower, as well as lifting the agenda of the Pacific, whose very existence of several countries is at stake.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The pledges most notably include one from China, the world’s leading emitter, which said it would cut emissions by 7-10% from its peak level by 2035.António Guterres, the UN secretary-general, convened the special summit for the new goals and urged countries, most of which are badly lagging in efforts to avoid breaching agreed temperature limits, to enact “much further, much faster” cuts.“Your new plans can take us a significant step forward,” Guterres told government leaders. “We are in the dawn of a new energy era, we must seize this moment of opportunity.”Guterres, whoadmittedthis week that the international goal of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C (2.7F) is at risk of “collapsing”, said that the upcoming UN climate talks in Brazil, known as Cop30, must produce “a credible global response plan to get us on track”.“The science demands action, the law commands it,” Guterres said, in reference to a recent international court of justiceruling. “The economics compel it and people are calling for it.”Until now, few countries had submitted updated emissions reduction plans ahead of the Cop30 talks in November, which is meant to feature new targets to help the world avoid worsening heatwaves, droughts, floods and other maladies.Currently the planet is set tovastly exceedthe 1.5C warming limit agreed a decade ago in Paris, with temperatures set to rise by as much as 3C (5.4F) beyond the pre-industrial average, triggering catastrophic consequences for many countries.This stuttering global effort has been further imperiled by the actions of the US, the world’s largest historic emitter of carbon pollution. On Tuesday, Trump gave a discursive speech littered with falsehoods to the UN, in which he dismissed accepted climate science and scolded leaders for shifting their countries to cleaner forms of energy.“Countries are on the brink of destruction because of the green energy agenda,” said the US president, who added that climate science is a “hoax”, that wind turbines are “pathetic” and outlined how he has pressed other countries, such as the UK, to drill for more oil.“If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail,” Trump said. “You need strong borders and traditional energy sources if you are going to be great again … All of these predictions made by the UN, often for bad reasons, are wrong. They were made by stupid people.”Trump, who hasdemolishedclimate regulations,haltedclean energy projects andwithdrawnthe US from the Paris climate deal, has long denied the realities of the climate crisis and his comments drew swift condemnation from activists.“Anyone looking outside their window knows climate change is here and happening,” said Manish Bapna, chief executive of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “The real question is why any responsible leader would try so hard to convince us otherwise.”Other climate advocates at the UN general assembly and concurrent climate week events also happening in New York said the world should rally on climate regardless of a Trump-led US and accelerate the transition to renewable forms of energy. Last year, $2tn wasinvested globallyin renewables such as solar and wind – double the amount going to oil, gas and coal.“All of the jobs, all of the opportunity that comes from clean economies is there,” said Rachel Kyte, the UK government’s climate envoy. “So don’t get distracted by the noise. Follow the signal, and I think we’ll get there.“One hundred and ninety-five countries ratified the Paris agreement and minus one is 194, not zero. There’s plenty of people that would seek to undermine, to threaten the Paris agreement, but 194 countries are showing up in Belém to keep the show on the road.”Of these countries still engaged in the climate effort, the greatest focus will be on China. It is responsible for around a third of all global emissions but has also become the world’s leading clean energy superpower. On Wednesday,Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, said the country would install more than six times as much wind and solar capacity in 2035, compared with 2020 levels.“It’s a great tragedy that the United States of America is hobbling itself and allowingChinato become the global leader in confronting the climate crisis,” Al Gore, the former US vice-president, said on Wednesday.But Gore said he was optimistic that the world would follow the clean energy path rather than the fossil-fuel revanchism espoused by Trump. “We are going to win this struggle, we are going to be successful,” he said. “The remaining question is whether or not we will win it in time to avoid the terrible negative tipping points that are out there.”Regardless of the latest round of announced emissions cuts, known as nationally determined contributions (or NDCs), the world is still on course to blow past 1.5C, a situation that countries vulnerable to sea-level rise and other threats consider to be existential.“Many of them need to be better,” said Tina Stege, climate envoy of the Marshall Islands, of the pledges. “There has to be a real honest assessment that they won’t be. We already know that these will not get us to where we need to be.”Governments will convene in Belém, Brazil, in an attempt to bridge this shortfall in November, although delegations may be shrunken due toa lack of available hotel roomsin the Amazon city.Juan Carlos Navarro, Panama’s minister of the environment, said the logistics of Cop30 have been “a nightmare” and that he has scant optimism of a positive outcome in Brazil. “To be frank, I have seen a lot of hot air and BS and very little progress,” he said.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisEuropeAntónio GuterresChinaUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Indian national, who arrived in the UK on a small boat in August, was flown into Paris from Heathrow.A fifth man, who is from Eritrea, has won a high court ruling placing a temporary block on his deportation. The Home Office wasrefused permission to appealon Tuesday.Three other people whose claims have been rejected – men from Afghanistan, Eritrea and Iran – have been flown toFrance.The move comes days after Donald Trump told the prime minister to “call out the military” to stop small boats as the number of crossings had hit a then record high, and claimed illegal migration could “destroy” countries.The business secretary, Peter Kyle, later said the Royal Navy could be called upon to tackle the crossings “if needed”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will continue to detain and remove those who arrive by small boat. And we will work with France to operate a legal route for an equal number of eligible migrants to come to the UK subject to security checks.”More than 1,000 people reached the UK on small boats on Friday, bringing the total to more than 32,000 so far this year.The director of external affairs at the Refugee Council, Imran Hussain, said of the first arrivals under the “one in, one out” scheme: “This is a really welcome step. No family should ever have to risk their lives in a flimsy boat just to reach safety.“By opening up safe and legal routes, we not only give children and parents the chance to rebuild their lives with dignity, but we take power away from the smugglers who profit from people’s desperation.”In a separate development, the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has ordered a review into the multimillion-pounduse of taxis by asylum seekersin hotels to transport them to medical appointments. The BBC reported on Tuesday that asylum seekers were being taken by taxi to GP or hospital appointments hundreds of miles away, with one running up a bill of £600 for one journey.The broadcaster gained access to four migrant hotels where it claimed there appeared to be a “constant stream of cabs arriving and leaving”. After the report, Mahmood asked the Home Office to investigate the use of taxis to transfer asylum seekers at the public’s expense.A Home Office spokesperson said: “The home secretary has asked the department to urgently look into the use of taxis to transfer asylum seekers.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficeFranceForeign policyEuropeRefugeesMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

They sicken the human conscience and shame the entire international community.”Diplomatic relations between Spain and Israel have curdled as a result of the Gaza offensive, with Madrid introducing several measures, including an arms embargo, and Sánchez accusing Benjamin Netanyahu’s government of“exterminating a defenceless people”by bombing hospitals and “killing innocent boys and girls with hunger”.Israel has responded by accusingSpainof waging “a continuous anti-Israel and antisemitic attack” and by barring entry to two members of Sánchez’s cabinet.Felipe said Spain was proud of its Sephardic Jewish history and proud to have introducedthe 2015 law that granted Spanish citizenshipto the descendants of the Jews who were expelled in 1492.“That’s why we find it so hard to understand what the Israeli government is doing in theGazaStrip and why it hurts us so much,” he said. “That is why we cry out, why we implore, and why we demand: stop this massacre now. No more deaths in the name of such an old and wise people who have suffered so greatly over the course of history.”His references to the Sephardic legacy echoed those of the Spanish foreign ministry, which has previously stressed Spain’s Jewish past when confronted with what it has termed “false and slanderous” accusations of antisemitism from the Israeli government.The king also said Spain had “forthrightly condemned the abominable terrorism of Hamas and, especially, the brutal slaughter of 7 October 2023”, and that Israel had a duty to adhere to international humanitarian law in Gaza and the West Bank.He called for humanitarian aid to be let into Gaza, for a ceasefire, and for Hamas to immediately release the hostages “it so cruelly continues to hold”. Felipe said the international community needed to push for the two-state solution, adding that the growing diplomatic recognition of the state of Palestine should help to secure a “just and definitive” regional peace.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Jim Gavin, who managed Dublin’s Gaelic football team, will represent its centrist coalition partner, Fianna Fáil. Catherine Connolly, an outspoken pro-Palestinian voice, is backed by small leftwing opposition parties as well asSinn Féin, which declined to field its own candidate.The election on 24 October will end the 14-year tenure of Michael D Higgins, who has drawn praise and criticism for turning the largely symbolic post intoa platformfor global issues, notably with regard to Gaza.View image in fullscreenThe mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor was one of several political outsiders to express interest in running for the presidency.Photograph: Noam Galai/Getty Images for Cantor FitzgeraldSeveral prominent figures,including Michael Flatley, Bob Geldof and the anti-immigration mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor – who was endorsed by Elon Musk – had expressed interest in running butfailed to win the backingof four local councils or 20 legislators that was required to get on the ballot.Gareth Sheridan, a pharma tycoon, and Maria Steen, a social conservative activist, narrowly failed to reach the threshold. “I regret to say it was not enough and that time has now run out,” Steen said on Wednesday. The public’s “hunger for an alternative candidate” would now go unsatisfied, she said.Several commentators, including liberals opposed to Steen’s views, had expressed hope she would make it on to the ballot to give voters more choice.The presidency was once a sinecure for establishment grandees but Mary Robinson’s insurgent victory in 1990 ushered in an era of unpredictable campaigns focusing more on candidates’ personalities than party affiliations.A 14 September opinion poll taken before Sinn Féin endorsed Connolly gave her 17%, behind Gavin on 18%, and Humphreys on 22%. Analysts said most voters in Irish presidential elections paid little attention until the final two weeks of campaigning, around the time of televised debates.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Connolly, 68, has been criticised for meeting Bashar al-Assad supporters during a 2018 trip to Syria and for telling the BBC this week that Hamas was “part of the fabric” of the Palestinian people, a comment that unnerved Labour and the Social Democrats, which are part of the coalition backing her campaign.Gavin, 54, a political novice parachuted in after successful careers in sport, aviation and the military, has assailed social media companies for allowing what he said were “completely unacceptable” lies and misinformation about him and his family on their platforms. “I’m not going to stand for it and at a broader context society shouldn’t stand for it,” he said.Humphreys, 62, a Presbyterian from the border county of Monaghan, faced questions over her inability to speak Irish and her family’s historical links with the pro-union Orange Order in Northern Ireland. Humphreys has said she favours Irish unity and supporters said her Protestant heritage could help win over Northern Ireland’s unionists.Explore more on these topicsIrelandFine GaelSinn FéinFianna FailEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Local reports suggested the drone had hit the ground next to a hotel, damaging several rooms.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, which occurred on the second day of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.Israel attack on Yemeni newspaper was second deadliest on journalists ever recordedRead moreIn an interview with Israel’s Channel 12 Eli Lankri, the mayor of Eilat, called on the government to “strike the Houthis hard” in retaliation, adding that repeated Houthi attacks have disrupted operations at the Eilat port.The Israeli military said interception attempts had been made but gave no further details.The local newspaper Israel Hayom, citing an initial investigation, said air defence systems had failed to intercept the drone.The drone attack on Wednesday comes days after the Houthis fired a drone that crashed in Eilat’s hotel zone, resulting in material damage but no casualties.The Houthis, who are backed by Iran, have been launching missiles and drones thousands of kilometres north towards Israel, in what the group says are acts of solidarity with the Palestinians. Most of the dozens of missiles and drones have been intercepted or fallen short of Israeli territory. Few have caused significant damage, though one temporarily shut down Israel’s main international airport earlier this year.King Felipe pleads with Israel to ‘stop massacre and abhorrent acts’ in GazaRead moreIsrael has retaliated by bombing Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen,including the vital Hodeidah port. The Houthis, who control the most populous parts of Yemen, have also been attacking vessels in the Red Sea since the start of the war in Gaza in October 2023.In Gaza, the Israeli military on Wednesday pressed its assault on Gaza City, from where hundreds of thousands of Palestinianshave been forced to flee.The war was triggered by Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel in which militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage. The ensuing Israeli military campaign has killed more than 65,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and injured more than 160,000,and has spread famine, reduced swathes of the territory to ruins and displaced most of the population, in many cases multiple times.Benjamin Netanyahu had told the family of Alon Ohel, a hostage still held in Gaza, that a combined military and diplomatic effort was being pursued to defeat Hamas and bring back all hostages, the Israeli prime minister’s office said on Wednesday.Explore more on these topicsIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

We have not got enough of anything.”Griffiths said the emergency department of the 90-bed field hospital where he was working in al-Muwasi had received 160 injured in a single night, with 600 people seeking treatment from its small primary health care clinic.Albanese warns Netanyahu expansion of settlements in West Bank risks putting two-state solution ‘out of reach’Read moreApproximately 320,000 people have already complied with Israeli military evacuation orders and fled Gaza City, according to the latest figures from the UN. Many are sick, injured or malnourished.The crisis has been made worse by the closure of a series of medical facilities in northern Gaza in recent days as Israel presses its offensive there.“People have been referred from the [hospitals in Gaza City] or are just making their own way. There is a huge number of kids, some very small, and a lot of younger men, [but] the blasts effect everyone. We are seeing this tsunami coming towards us, with more and more injuries and less and less [supplies to treat them],” Griffiths told the Guardian.With vehicles rare, roads clogged and many displaced people making the journey on foot, some patients were arriving with week-old injuries.“Even if you have a vehicle it can take a day or two at least. If the bullets or bombs don’t get them, then infection will. My message is just: please, we just need to stop the fighting.”At Nasser, the only large-scale facility still functioning in Gaza, new arrivals in the paediatric wards are being treated in corridors because all beds for children are full.“We are really just hanging on here. It is really bad. We are at our absolute limit. All the staff are exhausted and we are low on stores of essentials,” said Mohamed Saqr, the director of nursing at Nasser.In private messages seen by the Guardian, the Israeli military has told aid workers that only hospitals would be considered “protected” and that all other humanitarian sites in Gaza City must evacuate.The Jordanian field hospital in Gaza City’s south-western neighbourhood of Tal al-Hawa received orders to evacuate on Monday morning, according to a senior health official.Dr Munir al-Bursh, director general of Gaza’s health ministry, said the hospital had at least 300 patients, as well as medical staff. The order came as residents reported that troops were approaching the facility, with dozens of families trapped in their homes and shelters around the hospital.The Gaza health ministry said services had been suspended at two other Gaza City hospitals: al-Rantisi children’s hospital, which was badly damaged a few days ago by an Israeli bombardment, and the Eye hospital.“None of the facilities or hospitals have safe access routes that allow patients and the wounded to reach them,” the ministry said.Medics in Gaza City said al-Rantisi remained partly open as a first aid point, staffed by two nurses and a single doctor, though continuous shelling and shooting has made it impossible for people to access the hospital.IDF may launch new offensives after Gaza City, says ex-generalRead moreApproximately half of patients requiring dialysis in Gaza City have been forced to leave, according to Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP), an NGO working in Gaza, which also said that its rehabilitation unit in the central town in Deir al-Balah has reported a doubling of patient numbers in recent days.Israel launched its offensive into Gaza City, which it describes as the last stronghold of Hamas, last week.On Monday, Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, said he was determined to achieve his war aims in Gaza: the elimination of Hamas, the release of Israeli hostages held there and ensuring that Gaza “will no longer pose a threat to Israel”.Israel controls all access to Gaza and says it allows enough food, aid and supplies into the territory. Zikim crossing has remained closed since 12 September, however, significantly constraining the delivery of humanitarian aid in the north.The war was triggered by Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel in which militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage. The ensuing Israeli military campaign has killed more than 65,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and injured more than 160,000, and has spread famine, reduced swathes of the territory to ruins and displaced most of the population, in many cases multiple times.Abed al-Hayek, an MAP project manager, said on Tuesday that oxygen and fuel stocks at the al-Sahaba medical complex in Gaza City, which offers intensive care for newborns, were nearly depleted.“The situation remains extremely difficult and fuel is essential for providing the medical services we offer. Yesterday, we received 1,000 litres of fuel, which is only enough for four days, as we consume around 250 litres per day. We don’t know what will happen in just two days’ time,” al-Hayek said.Some supplies have got through. On Sunday, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) supplied the al-Shifa medical complex with fluid infusions, dressing kits, medicine and 500 body bags. Unicef also reached Gaza City, delivering hygiene supplies,a spokesperson said.1:13France, UK, Australia and Canada recognise Palestinian statehood – video“Much more is needed to adequately meet the astronomical levels of need that exist on the ground,” the ICRC said in a statement, blaming ongoing military operations and restricted humanitarian access for limiting aid deliveries.Griffiths, who travelled to Gaza withUK-Med, a frontline medical aid charity, said that the clinic in al-Muwasi where he was working was “short of everything”, including antibiotics and painkillers, and described how he had been unable to save a 14-year-old boy who had been shot in the head and neck.“He was clearly dying in front of us. There was nothing we could do. His dad was pleading with us to do something, but all we could do was to find somewhere quiet for them both,” said Griffiths.One of Britain’s leading specialists in the treatment of traumatic injuries, Griffiths described performing multiple operations on a younger boy with head, leg and torso injuries.“He is deeply, deeply traumatised. Emotionally, he is in pieces. He has lost his family, his parents, everything. Every day he is going to the theatre to have more shrapnel pulled out. I sit with him and hold his hand. I can make him better physically, but there is nothing I can do for the emotional trauma. It is horrific,” Griffiths said.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Now will international law die in Gaza too? | Raji SouraniRead moreShe added that her government had proposed to hand over the flotilla’s aid to Cyprus and the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem to prevent further risks and was expecting an answer from the flotilla activists about this compromise proposal.The attack late on Tuesday marked the third time this month that the flotilla had been targeted by drones. There have been no reports of injuries.Israel has repeatedly criticised the flotilla, accusing its activists of complicity with the Hamas militant group.“Multiple drones, unidentified objects dropped, communications jammed and explosions heard from a number of boats,” the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), organiser, said in a statement. “We are witnessing these psychological operations first-hand, right now, but we will not be intimidated.”Italian defence minister, Guido Crosetto, said in an earlier statement the convoy had been targeted by “currently unidentified perpetrators” and expressed the “strongest condemnation” of the attack.0:54Explosions and drones targeting Gaza aid flotilla boats, activists say – videoHe said the navy ship, which had previously been sailing north of Crete, was “already en route” towards the flotilla “for possible rescue operations”.Life Support, a search and rescue vessel that is accompanying the flotilla to provide medical and logistical support, said it witnessed drone attacks on several boats in the fleet.“From the bridge, we saw a large number of drones approaching from different directions, and the flashes of explosions hitting several boats,” said Anabel Montes Mier, head of mission on board Life Support.“The flotilla has informed us that no one was injured, but some boats were damaged. We would like to remind everyone that this is a non-violent, humanitarian mission and we strongly condemn any act of violence or attack on the flotilla,” she added.The German human rights activist, Yasemin Acar, said in a video posted on Instagram that five vessels had been attacked.In an earlier video, Acar said the activists had “sighted 15 to 16 drones”, adding that their radios had been jammed as loud music could be heard.One video posted by the flotilla’s official Instagram page showed an explosion it said it recorded from the Spectre boat.Benedetta Scuderi, an Italian MEP with the Greens-European Free Alliance group, told La Repubblica that the drones had dropped stun grenades, with one of them hitting the mast of the sailing boat on which she is travelling.In another video posted by the same page the Brazilian activist, Thiago Avila, said four boats had been “targeted with drones throwing devices” just before another explosion was heard in the background.Earlier this month, the GSF said that it wasattacked by drones over two dayswhile stationed in Tunisia. None of the passengers or crew were harmed during those events.At the time Tunisia’s interior ministry said at least one of the reports of drones had “no basis in truth”.The flotillaset sail from Barcelona in late Augustto “break the illegal siege of Gaza”, organisers said.It currently numbers 51 vessels, most of which are situated off the Greek island of Crete.Israel said Monday it would not allow the flotilla to reach Gaza.

Some cases were adjourned, while others were moved online or transferred to different venues.One respondent in South Shields, South Tyneside, said: “The court had to close early for two days within the last 12 months or so. This was because dead and rotting seagulls were within the roof insulation. The court had to close because maggots were literally raining down on to the lobby.”More everyday problems included inadequate air conditioning, dilapidated toilets and poor technology, ranging from poor quality remote hearings to software problems and a lack of working plug sockets.The Law Society president, Richard Atkinson, said: “The poor state of court buildings across England andWalesis both a contributor to the huge backlog of court cases and an illustration of the woeful lack of investment in our justice system. Government underfunding is denying us, our children and our businesses a vital public service.“The backlog in our crown courts stands at more than 76,957 cases, while two-thirds of care cases in family courts take longer than the 26-week time limit. There are currently 35,475 open family court cases, according to recent statistics.“Behind each of these statistics are tens of thousands of adults and children who could be freed from limbo and move forward with their lives if they could have their day in court.”The survey found the same proportion of solicitors considered the physical state of the court fit for purpose only “to some extent” (55%) or “to a large extent” (17%) as inthe last poll in 2022.One in five of almost 300 respondents in the latest survey, which was published on Thursday, said the technology in the courts was “not at all” fit for purpose.The Law Society said problems in the courts could deny clients access to justice – with many at risk of losing jobs and facing insecure housing situations – as well as wasting time and money.Solicitors with a disability were significantly more likely to find the physical state of the courts “not at all fit” for purpose (45%) compared with those without (25%). This was owing to limited accessibility in court buildings, such as an absence of ramps and working lifts.Issues withreinforced autoclaved aerated concrete(Raac), associated with crumbling schools and other buildings, were highlighted at courts in Doncaster, Preston and Harrow.A judicial office holder at Doncaster crown court said: “The magistrates court has Raac in the ceiling. Nobody has sought to fix it so the magistrates court has decamped to one half of the crown court (the other half occupied by the coroner’s court). If I am not in the one available court with a dock, I am operating in an office room being used as a courtroom with a kitchen as my retiring room.”Atkinson said more must be done to address the £1.3bn courts’ maintenance backlog.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “This government inherited a justice system in crisis but is working flat out to ensure our courts and tribunals are safe, secure and equipped with the latest technology.“We have already boosted capital funding to £148.5m and carried out around one million maintenance visits this year to make our buildings become fit for everyone who uses them.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandCourts in crisisWalesUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

We’re here for pandemic preparedness, for the vaccine programmes, and to help protect British patients over the winter.”Ricks said the UK’s rigorous pricing regime, under which it pays less for medicines than other developed countries, meant it would miss out on new drugs if it did not increase prices and scrap a contentious rebate scheme, known as VPAG, the voluntary scheme for branded medicines’ pricing, access and growth. VPAG negotiations over drug pricing between government and the industry broke down last month, and the government has yet to formally restart talks.Hughes said Moderna was in a different position, as vaccines do not come under the VPAG scheme. “The uptake of innovative vaccines is very, very good across the NHS, and the payment of those is done through central contracts.”Moderna’s new centre at the Harwell science campus, which hosts more than 250 organisations across health, technology and energy, will produce mRNA jabs for the NHS’s seasonal vaccination programmes. It has been granted a licence to make Covid jabs and will also apply for a licence to make flu vaccines.Beyond respiratory diseases, the Moderna site will be researching how to use mRNA science in areas such as cancer, rare diseases and immune disorders. It employs 80 people in manufacturing as well as 60 scientists and lab technicians at the clinical research and development facility. The latter will also analyse samples from Moderna’s clinical trials globally.The Moderna site can produce up to 100m mRNA vaccine doses a year, which could be ramped up to 250m in the event of a pandemic.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Messenger RNA trains the body to recognise and destroy harmful cells.Moderna’s chief executive, Stéphane Bancel, said its new centre marked “the first facility in the UK to manufacture an onshore supply of mRNA vaccines”.He added: “Our strategic partnership with the UK has already delivered more than 20 clinical trials across 110 sites nationwide, making Moderna the largest commercial sponsor of trials in the country.” He said the centre, which was built in less than two years, “underscores the UK’s commitment to improving health security, both against global health emergencies and ongoing seasonal respiratory threats”.Moderna’s opening was attended by the science minister, Patrick Vallance, who said last week that the government wasdetermined to resolve the standoffwith industry. He acknowledged that the UK’s spending on new medicines needed to rise from 9% of overall NHS spend.Vallance said on Thursday: “The pioneering work Moderna will be doing, here in the UK, on mRNA is a prime example of the opportunity we want to grasp.”This week the US drugmaker Bristol Myers Squibb said it would sell its new schizophrenia treatment in the UK for the same price as in the US, the first time it has done this. Cobenfy will have a list price of $22,500 (£16,553) a year.

They urge Threadneedle Street to commission a review of monetary policy, given the increasing frequency of climate-related shocks that can push up food prices, for example.Some economists have argued that central banks should be prepared to tolerate temporarily higher inflation, and even that governments should consider building up buffer stocks of staple foods to cushion the impact of price spikes caused by droughts or floods, which are becoming more common.The briefing warns that by raising interest rates to respond to such price rises, the Bank increases the cost of the huge public investment needed to transition away from fossil fuels.“The UK just experienced its worst inflationary crisis in four decades, triggered by fossil fuel price spikes and supply chain bottlenecks, which the UK’s monetary policy approach proved ill-equipped to address,” it says.A Bank spokesperson said: “Whilst the government is responsible for climate policy, climate risk threatening our objectives is part of the Bank’s remits, and we work to take action accordingly.”The Bank’s most recent monetary policy report, published as itcut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 4%, acknowledged the upside risk to inflation if “extreme weather events due to climate change were to negatively impact food production”.The campaigners are also calling on the Bank to ensure that climate risks are reflected in capital requirements for banks – the rules that determine what assets they must hold. And they would like to see the Bank discount fossil fuel-related assets when these are offered as collateral in its lending operations. The European Central Bank recentlysaid it would take account of “climate-change related uncertainties”in valuing the assets it accepts in exchange for loans.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On one side the progressive view where change came through democracy, the other driven by populists including Trump wanting a return to an older, more conservative worldview.View image in fullscreenBarack Obama who is on a European speaking tour was interviewed by historian David Olusoga at the O2 Arena.Photograph: PR IMAGEHe said: “My successor has not been particularly shy about it. That desire is to go back to a very particular way of thinking about America, where ‘we, the people’, is just some people, not all people. And where there are some pretty clear hierarchies in terms of status and who ranks where.”Obama was also critical of progressives who he said became “complacent” and “smug” in the 90s and 00s, “posturing that we believe in all these values because they were never tested. Now they’re being tested”.The former president has generally kept a low profile after leaving office. But he has made increasingly frequent interventions as the political landscape in the US becomes more violent, restive and divided along partisan lines.In London, Obama did not refer to Trump by name, only as “my successor”.The evening started with Olusoga welcoming the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, who had been criticised by Trump on Tuesday during his speech at the UN in New York.Khan had respondedby saying Trump had “shown he is racist, he is sexist, he is misogynistic and he’s Islamophobic”.Obama is in London as part of a European speaking tour, which includes another date in Dublin on Friday.

I know people are proud of their area, which is why they are so desperate to look after what they love and to get rid of the boarded-up shops, shuttered youth clubs and crumbling parks that have become symbols of a system that stopped listening.“That’s why we’re not handing down promises from Westminster. People have the answers to the problems in their communities and now they’ll have the tools to fix it. More power to restore pride in where they live – and on their terms.”Starmer heads to Liverpool this weekend for what is likely to be one of his toughest party conferences as Labour leader. With the party 10 points below Reform and close to its lowest ever poll rating, the prime minister is under more pressure than ever to show his strategy for government is bearing fruit.Andy Burnham, the man who would be kingRead moreThe pressure increased on Wednesday when the New Statesmanpublished an interviewwith Burnham in which he said the Labour party faced an “existential” threat and that the country needed “wholesale” change.“Am I ready to work with anybody who wants to sort of put in place a plan to turn the country around? I’m happy to play any role,” Burnham said, in comments that were widely interpreted as expressing an interest in the Labour leadership. “I am ready to play any role in that, yes. Because the threat we’re facing is increasingly an existential one.”On Wednesday eveningthe Telegraph published an interviewwith Burnham in which he said MPs had privately urged him to challenge Starmer for the party leadership.“People have contacted me throughout the summer – yeah. I’m not going to say to you that that hasn’t happened, but as I say, it’s more a decision for those people than it is for me.”Thursday’s announcement forms one part of a multi-day fightback by Starmer during which he also intends to give a speech about the threat of populism on Friday, before giving his conference speech on the theme of “reclaiming patriotism”.Under the regeneration plan that the prime minister will announce on Thursday, 330 deprived areas will receive tens of millions of pounds over a decade to be spent on renewal schemes. Officials say many of those areas will be in coastal communities, former coalfields and market towns – the kinds of places that voted heavily for Brexit and where Reform is performing strongly.They described them as “places that fell through the cracks of previous regeneration schemes”, with many of them having lost libraries, youth centres, pubs and post offices in recent years. The scheme has echoes of the previous government’s levelling up agenda, which was a plan championed by the former prime minister Boris Johnson as a way of reducing Britain’s yawning regional inequalities.Unlikethe levelling up funds, local authorities will be given the freedom to decide where the money will be spent, as well as extra powers to help them regenerate their high streets. Experts warn, however, that the money will need to be allocated and spent quickly to make a difference on either an economic or political level.Jack Shaw, the director of the thinktank Groundwork Research, said: “[This] announcement makes clear that investment in the public realm and high streets is back as a political priority – and on a bigger scale than under the Conservatives.Keir Starmer to launch progressive fightback against ‘decline and division’ fuelled by far rightRead more“But history tells us funding like this has been too slow to reach communities. If ministers want to deliver real change, they’ll need to move quickly and get spades in the ground without delay.”Alongside the money, local authorities will also be given extra power to take over derelict buildings and block certain businesses from setting themselves up on the high street. The government is planning to bring new legislation to allow local authorities to block bookmakers and other gambling businesses, vape shops and barbers that are deemed to be “fake”.The proposals are part of a wider devolution drive being spearheaded by the new communities secretary, Steve Reed. The Guardianrevealed this weekthat Reed was keen to give mayors more powers, with ministers exploring the possibility of handing over power on some health and education services to mayoral authorities.Downing Street believes Labour’s best hope of winning the next election is to show that there have been tangible improvements to people’s daily lives and local communities, if only small ones.Officials liken the strategy to the “broken windows” theory of policing pioneered by the New York police chief William Bratton in the 1990s, which prioritised dealing with low-level vandalism and antisocial behaviour as a way to foster local pride and help stop more significant crime.“It’s about demonstrating progress is possible,” said one No 10 official. “You can’t be progressive if people no longer believe in the idea of progress.”Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerReform UKPovertyCommunitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

The Dallas police chief, Daniel Comeaux, said that the FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence. The shooter died from a “self-inflicted gun wound”, according to the DHS secretary,Kristi Noem.TheDHS said no members of law enforcement were hurt in the attack.But Comeaux also said that officials would not be releasing the identities of any victims at this time.DHS officials say thiswas “an attack onIce law enforcement”.At both today’s press conference and in a statement, law enforcement said that shell casings found near the shooter had “anti-Ice” messaging on them.Texas Ice facility shooting: two dead and one injured, and ‘anti-Ice’ shell casings foundRead moreThe shooter has been identified as 29-year-oldJoshua Jahn,according to NBC News – which cited several senior law enforcement officials.Dallas police said that shots were fired “from an adjacent building”. The DHS later added that the shooter “fired indiscriminately” at the Ice facility, “including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot”. All three victims were inside the van at the time the gunman opened fire.The Dallas field office where the shooting occurred is used for short-term processing of people in custody. The victims may have been recently arrested by Ice. The facility is along Interstate 35 East, south-west of a large commercial airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and just blocks from hotels catering to airport travelers.Despite the fact that no federal agents were wounded in the shooting, the Texas governor,Greg Abbott, called the attack an “assassination”.For her part, Noem said that “these horrendous killings must serve as a wake-up call to the far left that their rhetoric about Ice has consequences”.Donald Trump instantly politicized the shooting,claiming ina social media postthat it “is the result of the Radical Left Democrats constantly demonizing Law Enforcement, calling for ICE to be demolished, and comparing ICE Officers to ‘Nazis.’”Thevice-president, JD Vance, claimed without evidence that the shooting was carried out by “a violent leftwing extremist” who was “politically motivated to go after law enforcement”.While the FBI has said that authorities recovered shell casings with “anti-Ice messaging” near the shooter, officials have neither confirmed a motive nor corroborated Vance’s claims about the shooter’s ideological background.Explore more on these topicsTexasIce (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US immigrationTrump administrationKristi NoemJD VanceGreg AbbottnewsShareReuse this content"

The president and his allies, however, were quick to frame the shooting as an attack on Ice and place blame on the “radical left”.The department previously said two detainees were killed, but later issued a clarifying statement saying the shooting killed one detainee. It said two other detainees were shot and are in critical condition.Texas Ice facility shooting: what we know so far about deadly attackRead moreOfficial statements have lacked focus on the victims having been detainees, and at a press conference officials said the identities of the victims would not be released at this time. Figures on the left have centered on the victims’ families, pushed for greater gun control and urged a rejection of anti-immigrant sentiment.Donald Trumprushed to politicize the incident, blaming the violence squarely on “Radical Left Terrorists” and theDemocraticparty. “This violence is the result of the Radical Left Democrats constantly demonizing Law Enforcement, calling for ICE to be demolished, and comparing ICE Officers to “Nazis,” hewroteon his Truth Social platform.JD Vancecalled the shooting an “obsessive attack on law enforcement” that “must stop”. The vice-president claimed it was carried out by “a violent left-wing extremist” who was “politically motivated to go after law enforcement”.Homeland security secretaryKristi Noemalso said: “This shooting must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about Ice has consequences. Comparing Ice Day-in and day-out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols has consequences.”TheFBIsaid authorities recovered shell casings with “anti-Ice messaging” near the shooter, but officials said the investigation was continuing and have neither confirmed the motive behind the attack, nor corroborated claims about the shooter’s ideological background.The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence. The DHS said the shooter “fired indiscriminately” at the Ice facility, “including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot”. The attacker died from a self-inflicted gun wound.Greg Abbott, the Republican Texas governor and staunch Trump ally, called the attack an “assassination” and said that “Texas supports Ice”. He wrote on X: “This assassination will NOT slow our arrest, detention, & deportation of illegal immigrants. We will work with ICE & the Dallas Police Dept. to get to the bottom of the assassin’s motive.”Texas senator Ted Cruz also invoked the killing of rightwing commentator Charlie Kirk as he told reporters that political violence “must stop” and rebuked politicians who have been critical of Ice. “Your political opponents are not Nazis,” Cruz raged atDemocrats, who he accused of “demonizing” Ice. “This has very real consequences,” he said.Later, after a reporter brought up reports that the victims were detainees, Cruz acknowledged that the motive of the shooter was not known.The attack comes amid fears the Trump administration plans a crackdown on leftwing organizations and amid the censorship of critical or nuanced commentary in the aftermath of Kirk’s killing, targeting people fromvisa holdersto late-night talkshow hostJimmy Kimmel.Marc Veasey, a Democratic representative for Texas who represents the area where the shooting took place, told the Notus website that political “gamesmanship” was spiraling out of control, and said hewas “sickened”by officials’ focus on law enforcement and lack of acknowledgement that the victims were detainees.He added that he lacked trust in the FBI, which had become “overly political” under Trump, and said smears against Democrats were not helpful, citing that the GOP also routinely call colleagues on the left “Marxists”.“We have to start condemning this rhetoric from both sides,” Veasey said. “I was hoping that after the assassination of Charlie Kirk that we would have learned lessons and that we realize that this is not about gamesmanship. This is not about one-upsmanship … This is about public safety.”Former Arizona congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who leads the gun violence prevention group Giffords, said her heart broke for the victims’ families and urged leaders to take action against the “gun crime crisis” gripping the country.Congresswoman Summer Lee of Pennsylvania, wrote on X: “Leave it to this administration to use a shooting against immigrant detainees to score political points and further provoke violence. We have to get guns off our streets and reject xenophobic and anti-immigrant sentiment that makes all of us less safe.”Pennsylvania state representative Malcolm Kenyatta said: “Kristi Noem couldn’t get to Twitter fast enough to use the Dallas Ice shooting for political points.

Jimmy Kimmel Live! typically averages about 1.6 million broadcast viewers per night.Jimmy Kimmel says silencing comedians is ‘anti-American’, as his show returns to air after suspensionRead moreKimmel’s previous most-watched monologue on YouTube was from another emotional occasion in 2017, when Kimmelrevealedthat the birth of his son, Billy, with a congenital heart condition required immediate open-heart surgery. Other highly viewed monologues include his reaction to Will Smith’s infamous slap of Chris Rock at the 2022 Oscars (13m views), his response to the mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas in 2017 (10m views) and his thoughts on Trump’s re-election last November (9m views).The spike in viewership comes after Disneysuspendedhis late-night show under pressure from the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) over hiscommentson the shooting of rightwing activistCharlie Kirk. The decision quickly became a cultural flashpoint, prompting nationaloutcry over free speechand condemnation over the bullying tactics of the Trump administration. Disney reversed course on Monday, following “thoughtful conversations with Jimmy” and pressure fromHollywood stars,free speech advocates, consumerboycotts, unionprotestsand even Republicans such asTed Cruz.0:32Jimmy Kimmel returns to air with emotional monologue – videoShortly before Tuesday’s show aired,Donald Trumplashed out at the host, a longtime needler and critic and criticized ABC for allowing his return to broadcast.“I can’t believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back,” Trumpwroteon Truth Social. “The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled! Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his ‘talent’ was never there.”“I think we’re going to test ABC out on this,” he added.“Let’s see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative,” Trump said, seemingly referring to thesettlement he reached with ABC Newslast year in a defamation lawsuit filed against the network.In his return, Kimmel was neither conciliatory nor fiery. He decried his suspension as “anti-American” – “this show is not important,” he said, “what is important is that we get to live in a country that allows us to have a show like this” – and clarified his stance on Kirk’s death. “It was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man,” he said. “I don’t think there’s anything funny about it.”The rise and fall of Disney: how the company found then lost its backboneRead more“Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions of what – it was obviously a deeply disturbed individual,” he added. “That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make, but I understand that to some that felt either ill-timed or unclear, or maybe both. And for those who think I did point a finger, I get why you’re upset. If the situation was reversed, there’s a good chance I’d have felt the same way.”Kimmel also praised Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, for offering the accused killer forgiveness in a televised memorial service over the weekend.“Look, I never imagined I would be in a situation like this,” he later said. “I barely paid attention in school. One thing I did learn from from Lenny Bruce and George Carlin and Howard Stern, is that a government threat to silence a comedian the president doesn’t like is anti-American … Let’s stop letting these politicians tell us what they want and tell them what we want.”Jimmy Kimmel Live! will air as usual on Wednesday night, except on the 28 affiliates owned by Nexstar and the 38 owned by Sinclair. On Wednesday, Nexstar toldVarietythat it is “continuing to evaluate the status of ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’ on our ABC-affiliated local television stations, and the show will be preempted while we do so. We are engaged in productive discussions with executives at The Walt Disney Company, with a focus on ensuring the program reflects and respects the diverse interests of the communities we serve.”Explore more on these topicsJimmy KimmelComedyTV comedyUS televisionTelevisionYouTubeTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Plans with Disney+, Hulu and ESPN, with ads, were previously $16.99 and are soon to be $19.99, according toDisney’s website.Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Consumers have been vocal about Disney’s handling of Kimmel in recent days,responding by cancelingtheir subscriptions to Disney+ and bundles with Hulu and ESPN Select. However, a company spokespersontold Bloombergthat the price increases were planned for months and unrelated to the Kimmel controversy.The comments that culminated inKimmel’ssuspension came earlier this month in the aftermath ofCharlie Kirk’s death. Kimmel said on his show that the Make America Great Again movement was “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it”.A few days later, Nexstar Media Group, which owns 28ABCaffiliates, announced that it was pulling Kimmel’s show because his comments were “offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse”.Disney, also facingpolitical pressurefrom the Federal Communications Commission, followed suit by suspending the show.The New York Timesreported that the “cancel Disney+” campaign caused more “subscriber churn” than previous efforts to boycott Netflix over some of its controversies.This is the fourth consecutive year thatDisney+has raised its streaming prices since launching Disney+ in 2019. It follows suit with many other streaming services, including Netflix and Peacock, which both announced price hikes earlier this year.Explore more on these topicsWalt Disney CompanyJimmy KimmelABCESPNHuluDisney+US television industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Prices on the firm’s website begin at $5,800.The invitation from Rolex to Trump, who attended the US Open final alongside senior administration officials including the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent; the attorney general, Pam Bondi; and the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, as well as his son-in-law Jared Kushner, “raises questions about whether you are cultivating a relationship with President Trump in attempts to secure lucrative tariff exemptions for Rolex products”, said Warren.She added: “Other corporate executives have used these tactics to escape tariffs, and it would be deeply troubling if your efforts provided another example of the Trump administration’s brazen corruption and capitulation to special interests.”Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, using Trump’s favored jibe about Warren, said: “Pocahontas should find a better use of her time than conjuring up asinine conspiracy theories.”Rolex did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS Open Tennis 2025SwitzerlandWatchesTrump tariffsTrump administrationUS Open tennisShareReuse this content"

Under the legislation the commissioner can seek fines of up to $50m for non-compliance.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailIn its submission, X said less than 1% of the platform’s Australian users were under 16, and while the company agrees strategies for mitigating the risk of harm to children are fundamental, it had concerns about the social media ban.The company’s submission echoed similar concerns raised when the legislation was before the parliament.“We have serious concerns as to the lawfulness of the Social Media Minimum Age, including its compatibility with other regulations and laws, including international human rights treaties to which Australia is a signatory,” X said in its submission published on Wednesday.Australia’s under 16s social media ban could extend to Reddit, Twitch, Roblox and even dating appsRead more“We are especially concerned about the potential negative impact that the Social Media Minimum Age will have on the human rights of children and young people, including their rights to freedom of expression and access to information, principles which are enshrined in international treaties including the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and which must be protected.”Xpointed to commentsfrom the Australian Human Rights Commission in November expressing significant reservations about the legislation.X argued age assurance for users was a disproportionate response, and there was no evidence banning young people from social media would work to protect young people online or reduce harms without creating new ones.3:12YouTube included in Australia's social media ban for children, communications minister says – video“Not least amongst these concerns is the risk that when minors are barred from mainstream, regulated social media services, they will migrate to less moderated or entirely unregulated alternatives, thereby exposing them to greater potential harms including privacy breaches or unmoderated content,” X stated.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Luke Donald and his team may have been booed at the opening ceremony on Wednesday, but the reception they got from the tens of thousands of liquored-up golf fans who had hung around to watch was a warm welcome compared to the one they gave New York state’s governor, the Democrat Kathy Hochul, who was jeered so loudly that her short speech was just about drowned out. Donald should maybe think about bringing her in as a last‑minute vice-captain, just to draw the fire away from his team.“Relax everybody, she’s not Roger Goodell,” said the master of ceremonies, Carson Daly, referencing the unpopular NFL commissioner. It didn’t help. “What should everyone coming here for the first time know about New York?” he asked Hochul. (“She has no idea! She lives in Albany!” bellowed a man standing nearby, “Get her outta here!” roared another.) Hochul, a rictus grin fixed on her face, said something about how “we have the most friendly people you will ever meet” and was immediately shouted down by the locals. “That went well,” Daly said, deadpan, after Hochul beat a retreat from the stage.View image in fullscreenNew York state’s governor, the Democrat Kathy Hochul (left), was jeered by fans at the Ryder Cup opening ceremony.Photograph: Maddie Meyer/PGA of America/Getty ImagesDonald got off lightly in comparison. “New York is a place where if you show up with talent and a fighting spirit the city will get behind you” he said, gamely. “No it won’t!” someone cried back at him. He nearly broke out laughing when they booed him again for saying: “You’ll make us earn every cheer.” He couldn’t help himself but slip in a couple of subtle little digs at the USA team over the way they are being paid to play here this week, but they were so subtle you needed to speak diplomat’s English to pick up on them.Morikawa urges ‘absolute chaos’ from US fans but Rose backs Europe to focusRead more“We’re fuelled by something money can’t buy,” Donald said, a wry smile passed across his face while he let the comment settle, “by resilience, togetherness, and proving people wrong”.You get the impression he has enjoyed every awkward question which has been fired at the US players about it this week. And there have been a lot of them, especially from the European journalists. Before he finished, Donald made a point of offering his thanks to Hochul, who was roundly booed again, just for having the temerity to be mentioned in someone else’s speech.Keegan Bradley followed him on. He spoke about his formative memory of theRyder Cup, which turned out to be one of the most infamous moments in its history. When he was 13 his father had taken him along to watch at Brookline in 1999, when the USA came back from four points back to win in the singles on Sunday. He was one of the people charging around the 17th green when Justin Leonard’s putt went in. Only he misspoke and told everyone it was Justin Rose. Given Rose is 46, and 1999 was his second year as a professional, he couldn’t have been so very offended by the suggestion he was old enough to have done it.View image in fullscreenUS Captain Keegan Bradley leads his team out on to the stage.Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPAIt was a good speech regardless. He told everyone the story about how he used to climb over the fence by the maintenance sheds to play here at Bethpage when it was supposed to be closed while he was a student at St John’s University, and how he once got busted by the park service while he was midway down the 17th, and how he used to work in the coat check room at the Wheatley Hills course, a few miles up the road. He’s a New Englander by birth, but a New Yorker by upbringing, and he closed with: “Go Giants!” The crowd lapped it up.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The opening ceremony of the Ryder Cup is usually one of the most painful spectator events in all sport, especially when it’s held in Europe. This one moved along at a brisk clip, and was soundtracked by the Beastie Boys and Jay-Z, and studded with a helicopter fly-by which was timed to arrive during the closing notes of the national anthem, and a parachute display team who landed just off the 18th fairway. Actually, that last part might have been a better idea on paper, because it took them an awfully long time to arrive, even falling at 80mph, and there was a long pause to fill while everyone watched them drop.View image in fullscreenUS military helicopters perform a flyover at the Ryder Cup opening ceremony as the locals wave the Stars and Stripes.Photograph: John Angelillo/UPI/Shutterstock“This might take a while,” said Daly. “While we’re waiting, does anyone have any questions for the governor?

As Fry collapsed in the batter’s box and immediately grabbed his bloodied face, a visibly shaken Skubal threw off his glove and cap as Vogt and trainers rushed on to the field. Fry lay in the dirt for several minutes before being slowly helped to his feet. He gave a thumbs-up signal as he sat up and was driven off in a cart before being taken to a local hospital for observation.The Guardians said Fry was discharged on Wednesday afternoon and is resting comfortably. Imaging showed the 29-year-old sustained multiple facial and nasal fractures. A timeline for recovery is six to eight weeks and Fry will not need surgery. He was placed on the 10-day injured list before Wednesday’s game. Outfielder Johnathan Rodríguez was called up from Triple-A Columbus as a replacement.After the game, Skubal said seeing Fry in distress was difficult. “Really tough,” the left-hander said. “I’ve already reached out to him. I’m sure his phone is blowing up. I just want to make sure he’s all right. Obviously, he seemed like he was OK coming off the field and hopefully it stays that way.After the incident, Skubal threw a wild pitch to George Valera, who replaced Fry, allowing Cleveland to score. Skubal also had an error – he inexplicably tried to make a blind throw to first between his legs – and was also called for a balk in the sixth inning as the Guardians rallied for three runs to take a 3-2 lead without hitting a ball out of the infield. The Guardians won the game 5-2, putting them into a tie for first place with the Tigers in the AL Central.Explore more on these topicsCleveland GuardiansDetroit TigersMLBBaseballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Just as it seemed he would record his first victory asNottingham Forestmanager in a competition he won last season, Antony levelled for Real Betis to kill the impending party.Igor Jesus scored twice as Forest recovered from Cédric Bakambu’s opener and hit the woodwork in pursuit of a first-half hat-trick but the former Manchester United winger, derided in some quarters after struggling in the Premier League, struck a 85th-minute equaliser.Nottingham Forest’s last European adventure: ‘Klinsmann knows my name!’Read moreCompared to the capitulation last Wednesday in altogether different surroundings at Swansea, this was nothing – the Championship club scored in the 93rd and 97th minute to earn a comeback Carabao Cup victory – but it was a galling finish all the same.Forest under Postecoglou have so far been a double-edged proposition but the overriding feeling for the travelling fans at the final whistle – about 5,000 flocked to Seville, 3,385 were stationed up in the gods in the away end – was probably pride. “Europe again, olé, olé,” they sang as the players headed in their direction.The most appetising takeaway was undoubtedly Igor Jesus’s first goal, a slick team move and an explicit example of Postecoglou’s vision. “I guess that’s the challenge: to make sure the players don’t drop their heads because we’re not getting the victories,” the Australian said. “Some of the football we played was outstanding.”This was a big moment, Forest’s first competitive game on the European stage since March 1996 and, as Postecoglou highlighted, finally an opportunity for the generations of supporters who have heard the stories of yesteryear but not lived the experiences. The thing Postecoglou now craves is that first win and Forest will hope it comes at the fifth time of asking, when Sunderland visit the City Ground for his first home game. “We are in a results business and ultimately we need to convert our good into victories,” Postecoglou said. “If one goes in off one of the boys’ backsides, I won’t be disappointed with that either because we’re missing a bit of luck.”View image in fullscreenIgor Jesus scores Forest’s first European goal for 29 years.Photograph: Marcelo del Pozo/ReutersThe Forest fans sang about trips to Gillingham, Huddersfield, Hull and Rotherham; five years ago on Thursday they lost 1-0 at Huddersfield, with Ryan Yates, a late substitute here, the sole survivor from the squad that day. Evangelos Marinakis has spent millions furnishing the squad since, including £200m this summer so that the squad could compete on all fronts, and amid the celebrations after promotion three years ago, the Greek billionaire vowed to return Forest to Europe. “Sometimes you don’t see the future because you always talk about the past,” he said.Consider this a vision fulfilled, then, Marinakis present as Igor Jesus became Forest’s goalscorer in Europe since Steve Stone’s consolation against Bayern Munich 29 years ago.Betis began quicker and gained the lead after quarter of an hour, Antony skating past Morato and punching a pass into Bakambu, who blasted high into the top corner of Matz Sels’s goal. But they had the upper hand for just three minutes, Igor Jesus applying a simple finishing touch to a wonderful Forest move.Quick GuideEuropa League roundup: Celtic earn point in BelgradeShowThe half-time substitute Kelechi Iheanacho firedCelticahead in Belgrade before the Scottish champions had to settle for a point againstRed Starin their Europa League opener. Iheanacho finished brilliantly as Celtic made a flying start to the second half but they were pegged back by former West Ham, Stoke and Inter forward Marko Arnautovic, who scrambled the ball home after a corner.Brendan Rodgers’ side could not get back on the front foot and would have been more than satisfied to take a 1-1 draw back from Serbia given the overall balance of play in the Rajko Mitic Stadium.Iheanacho had replaced Daizen Maeda at half-time after the Japan international struggled in the centre-forward role. Celtic had failed to make any chances from open play by half-time but they immediately improved, forcing three saves before Iheanacho took an excellent touch in the box and stroked the ball into the top corner in the 55th minute.On the performance of Maeda, who was denied a summer move because of the club's failure to source an adequate replacement, Rodgers told BT Sport: \"He wasn't at his best, or nowhere near it. However, he's a good guy and sometimes that happens in the game. I could have made a couple of changes at half-time. I wanted to make that one certainly to give us that greater reference at the top of the pitch. I thought Kels coming in was very, very good for us.\"We needed someone centrally to hold the ball up. I felt that we arrived into the final third in the first half and then we were either loose with the ball or didn't hold the ball up.\"It's one of Kels' great strengths. He can take the ball in, he can use his body well and obviously allows you to progress up the pitch. So he gave us a really much better platform in the second half.\"Romabegan their campaign with a 2-1 victory atNice,sparked by quickfire goals from defenders Evan N'Dicka and Gianluca Mancini within three minutes early in the second half, after a cautious and uneventful opening period.Terem Moffi pulled one back for the hosts from the penalty spot in the 77th minute after Niccolo Pisilli brought down Antoine Mendy inside the area, setting up a tense finish, but Nice could not find the equaliser despite late pressure.Nice captain Dante became the oldest outfield player in the competition's history at 41. Portuguese sideBragacelebrated a 1-0 home victory over Feyenoord,sealed by Fran Navarro's decisive strike in the 79th minute.PA Media, ReutersWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Forest shifted the ball from left to right, Oleksandr Zinchenko, the left-back having floated to the edge of the opposition 18-yard box, and Elliot Anderson playing one-touch passes before Douglas Luiz located Morgan Gibbs-White, playing on the right of a three-pronged attack. Gibbs‑White slid a diagonal ball across goal and Igor Jesus converted from inside the six-yard box. Postecoglou retreated towards the away dugout, applauding as he went, and more joy followed five minutes later. Douglas Luiz whipped an inswinging corner into the box and Igor Jesus headed in.Forest were in control after acquainting themselves and at half‑time they could reflect on 13 shots to Betis’s one, with Igor Jesus, who also scored twice at Swansea, rattling a post as he came within inches of a 14-minute hat-trick. Forest were rampant and should have extended their lead. Arnaud Kalimuendo, who replaced the cautioned Igor Jesus, fluffed his lines as Forest soared upfield; Zinchenko ignored Dan Ndoye, another substitute, to his left and instead fed Kalimuendo, whose first touch hindered his progress.The size of the task facing Forest was clear at the outset given Betis, eighth in La Liga, had lost just one of their previous 18 home games in European competition. The Betis substitute Pablo Fornals flashed a shot wide and it proved a warning sign the visitors did not heed. Natan, the centre-back, then made a mess of a golden chance a minute later, but Antony seized his.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueReal BetisNottingham ForestEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

As part of his broadcasting role, Brady has access to others teams’ players and coaches, an option unavailable to owners of other NFL teams. Some believe his dual role brings upa conflict of interestand gives Brady and, by extension, the Raiders an unfair advantage over other teams. The topicdrew even more debate last weekwhen Brady was seen in the Raiders’ coaching booth during the team’s loss to the Los Angeles Chargers. The NFL said Brady did not break any rules.Tom Brady’s jaunt into the Raiders’ coaching booth exposed an NFL blind spotRead moreInWednesday’s edition of his weekly newsletter, Brady addressed the criticism.“When you live through uncertain and untrusting times like we are today, it is very easy to watch a person’s passions and profession intersect, and to believe you’re looking at some sort of dilemma. Because when you’re blinded by distrust, it’s hard to see anything other than self-interest,” Brady wrote.The seven-time Super Bowl champion added that he is aware of the ethics of his roles in retirement.“I love football. At its core it is a game of principles. And with all the success it has given me, I feel I have a moral and ethical duty to the sport; which is why the point where my roles in it intersect is not actually a point of conflict, despite what the paranoid and distrustful might believe. Rather, it’s the place from which my ethical duty emerges: to grow, evolve, and improve the game that has given me everything,” he wrote.On Sunday, Brady was in theFoxcommentary booth for the Chicago Bears’ victory over the Dallas Cowboys. In the run-up to that game, Brady had access to coaches and players for the Bears, who the Raiders face this week. However, Chicago head coach Ben Johnson said he was unbothered by Brady’s presence. Johnson said he had no intention of giving “trade secrets” to Brady.Explore more on these topicsTom BradyLas Vegas RaidersFoxNFLUS television industryUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The Cubs lost the game 1-0. They are aiming to securethe top wildcard slot in the National League, which would give them home-field advantage in the first round of the playoffs. Shaw’s absence was also a boost for the Reds, who are in a battle with the New York Mets and Arizona Diamondbacks for the final wildcard spot in the NL.The robots are (almost) coming: MLB players allowed to challenge balls and strikes in 2026Read moreShaw was asked about his decision on Tuesday, before the Cubs’ game with the Mets. Kirk’s widow, Erika, invited Shaw to the memorial and the infielder said he felt it was his duty to attend. Kirk was from the Chicago area and got to know Shaw when they lived in the same apartment complex in Arizona. Shaw said the pair bonded over their Christian faith.“My connection with Charlie was through our faith,’’ Shaw said. “And that’s something that drives me every day, the reason why I’m able to do what I do every day, and that’s something I’m extremely thankful for. I know without my faith and without the many blessings I’ve been given in my life that I wouldn’t be here, be able to talk to you guys, able to help this team eventually go and win championships. That’s something I feel really, really blessed about, so whatever backlash comes is OK.”The Cubs were not allowed to bring in a replacement to their roster for Shaw as he was ineligible for the bereavement list, which is reserved for players who have lost family members. The rookie said he had talked to his teammates and manager before making the decision to attend.“For him to go and be a part of a celebration of life and grieve, from a human level, I understand it,” Chicago’s veteran outfielder Ian Happtold the Chicago Sun-Times. “We’re baseball players, and that takes up a ton of our life, but there’s a huge human element to this game, and it’s really hard to lose a friend and really hard to lose someone you’re close to.”The Mets’ popular play-by-play announcer, Gary Cohen, gave his thoughts on the SNY broadcast for Tuesday’s game.“I don’t want to talk about any of the politics of it, but the thought of leaving your team in the middle of a [wildcard] race for any reason other than a family emergency, really strikes me as weird,”said Cohen.The Cubs selected Shaw with the 13th overall pick in the 2023 MLB draft. He is batting .224 in his rookie season with 12 home runs. He was back in the Cubs lineup to face the Mets on Tuesday but his team gave up a 6-1 lead ina 9-7 defeat.Explore more on these topicsChicago CubsMLBCharlie Kirk shootingBaseballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Particularly at a crucial moment in 2012Timothy M GayWed 24 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 24 Sep 2025 08.05 EDTShareHas it really been 13 years since rosy-cheekedRory McIlroycaused teammates, coaches, and a continent’s worth of fans to hyperventilate by coming within a hairsbreadth of missing his tee time for a crucial singles match?The scene at the 2012Ryder Cup, recall, looked like something out of The Blues Brothers, except there weren’t any nuns or Nazis around. Having barreled down Illinois highways at upwards of 100mph, its siren blaring, an unmarked cop car came screeching into the parking lot of the Medinah Golf Club, skirted the camera crews huddled to record McIlroy’s frenzied arrival, and deposited him just steps away from the locker room.USA will have to win Ryder Cup to escape pay-free Europe’s money talk | Ewan MurrayRead moreMcIlroy at that instant had all of nine minutes to grab something to eat, “warm up,” and get to the first tee for his match against Keegan Bradley, otherwise he’d be forced to forfeit. Since his team was trailing 10-6 going into Sunday singles, a McIlroy no-show would have ruined one of the most storied comebacks in Cup history,the Europeans’ “Miracle at Medinah.”Today, it’s hard to imagine the Northern Irishman, who has seized the mantle of the late Seve Ballesteros as Team Europe’s unflagging leader, being so slipshod about the Ryder Cup. But in September 2012, McIlroy was a tender 23, the world’s newly crowned No 1, and the winner that summer of two legs of the FedEx Cup, not to mention the PGA Championship, his second career major. To the young McIlroy, the staid old Ryder Cup must have seemed like weak tea.That tea has gotten much stronger for a player who just won the Irish Open in spectacular fashion. At the 2023 Cup in Rome,McIlroy had to be restrainedafter a US caddie interfered with his putting preparation on day two.At this week’s Cup, which starts on Friday at Bethpage Black outside New York City, McIlroy and his mates will be trying to become the first team to win on foreign soil since the Medinah crew pulled off their miracle. McIlroy has added fuel to the fire by claiming that winning a Ryder Cup on hostile turf is the hardest thing to do in sports. His hyperbole will only make New York fans chant “USA!! USA!!” that much louder.What caused McIlroy to be so tardy back in 2012? Well, he said he confused Central and Eastern Time that morning as he began a lengthy Facetime session with his then-girlfriend, Caroline Wozniacki. His conspicuous absence was noticed by two PGA of America officials, one of whom, Erica Stoll, would five years later become his wife. The pair arranged for a local police officer to provide McIlroy with an emergency ride. Only their quick thinking and the “Ryder Cop’s” lead foot kept McIlroy from a lifetime of humiliation.To tease McIlroy, US fans began chanting “Cen-tral Time Zone! (clap, clap, clap-clap-clap!) and “What’s Your Tee Time?”“It was funny for the first two holes,” McIlroy said later, “and after that I just wanted to shut them up.” Fans also loudly inquired about the severity of McIlroy’s “hangover,” as well as bellowing, “Was She Worth It?!” with more handclaps thrown in for good measure.It’s testament to McIlroy’s self-belief that he never let Bradley get ahead of him. The match’s most amusing moment came on the short par-four 15th hole. Led by captain Jose-Maria Olazábal, the brain trust of the European team gathered behind Rory on the tee box. It pained McIlroy to lay up on a drive-able par four, but with a one-up lead and his coaches (plus an entire continent) breathing down his neck, he smartly hit a four-iron into the left-center of the fairway.Captain Olazábal got into McIlroy’s grill and sarcastically “congratulated” him for his judicious tee shot. McIlroy responded by taking off his golf glove and playfully tapping his captain’s nose. Everyone on the tee box, Olazábal included, had a good chuckle. McIlroy’s subsequent birdie all but clinched the match.McIlroy’s win was part of the Euros’ clean sweep of the first five singles contests, catapulting them to victory. McIlroy not only became a champagne-drenched hero that day, he (eventually) ended up getting the girl.More than anything, his near mess-up at Medinah is the thing that made McIlroy desperate to be a Ryder Cup warrior in the mold of Ballesteros.What would have happened if Stoll and company hadn’t been so conscientious and saved his bacon? We don’t know exactly, but it probably would not have been pretty.This muchiscertain: today’s Rory McIlroy, the guy hellbent on kicking butt in Ryder Cups, would not abide for one millisecond any slaphappy behavior from a young teammate.Timothy M Gay, an American writer and historian, is the author of Rory Land: The Up-and-Down World of Golf’s Global Icon, now available from Regalo Press/Simon & Schuster-UK.Explore more on these topicsRory McIlroyRyder Cup 2025Ryder Cup 2012Ryder CupGolfUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Monday that parting was formallysealed with a multimillion-pound settlementand Horner is free to move on. It is all but impossible to imagine he will not attempt to hurl himself back into Formula One, doubtless spurred-on by having a point to make to his former employer.On Monday Horner and Red Bull’s parent company,Red BullGmbH, announced they had reached an agreement worth £80m to end his career with the team, after he had been removed from his post as team principal shortly after the British GP in July.Even Michael Schumacher had weekends like Piastri, McLaren chief insistsRead moreHorner had led Red Bull since its first season in 2005, taking them from humble beginnings to eight drivers’ and six constructors’ titles. His credentials as a team leader, for all that some dislike his style, his attitude and his singular approach to going racing, cannot be questioned. Alongside Mercedes’ Toto Wolff and Jean Todt at Ferrari, he has been the most successful team principal of this millenium.It is understood the 51-year-old is indeed eager to return to the fray. While no details have been released, it is believed as part of his settlement his period of gardening leave could end after spring next year, after the opening flyaway rounds but before the summer. However, quite where he might be then remains moot.View image in fullscreenAston Martin would like to sign Max Verstappen, so the clash between his father, Jos (right), and Christian Horner makes it less likely the former Red Bull team principal would go there.Photograph: Ali Haider/EPAHaving taken his treatment by Red Bull hard, returning as an employee, subject again to the whims of the board, would understandably not be his preferred choice. He is thought to be far more interested in becoming at least a part owner of a team as well as its boss. No easy task. The days of setting up a team from scratch on a shoestring are long gone and approval for new entries are as rare as hen’s teeth and could take years.Buying into an existing outfit would be the likely path. However, for all that his settlement was eye-wateringly large, it is nowhere near enough to go it alone. McLaren were recently valued at £3.5bn and 2024 estimates on even the underperforming Alpine put it at $1.5bn (£1.1bn).Buying in at the lower end of the scale would also require investment backing but would offer the chance of being at least a co-owner, similar to Wolff at Mercedes. The most attractive option in this case would be Alpine. He is close friends with Flavio Briatore, the team’s executive adviser and de-facto boss who is running it on behalf of the owner, Renault. Moreover they have long been an outfit underperforming given their facilities, resources, experience and personnel. Exactly the sort of environment Horner transformed to reap such success at Red Bull.When asked about it before Horner’s settlement with Red Bull, Briatore, wily as ever, evaded the issue by noting: “Christian is not inFormula Onein this moment any more. I hope he comes back soon but, for the moment, he’s not in the picture of Alpine.” That moment has now passed and for all that Renault protest they do not want to sell the team, they no longer manufacture their own engines and their ownership now has the sense of a legacy waiting to be dealt with. A Briatore-Horner team-up also has a heady air of drama about it that the pair would doubtless adore.Haas too could also offer a potential buy-in on a slightly cheaper scale but they do not have quite the sleeping giant promise of Alpine and would present a challenge of immense longevity.In terms of just taking a team principal role again, Ferrari too have been suggested. John Elkann, the Ferrari chair, admires Horner and before his dismissal he was being linked to a potential move to the Scuderia. However, since then they haverenewed Fred Vasseur’s contractas team principal.Aston Martin have also been in the frame as a destination and certainly a big name like Horner would fit the grand ambition of the owner, Lawrence Stroll, but for one potential major stumbling block. Aston and Stroll have made no secret of their desire to sign the four-time world champion Max Verstappen.Given the breakdown in relations between the Verstappen camp and Horner at Red Bull, in particular the acrimony from Verstappen’s father, Jos, toward Horner, it is impossible to imagine they would countenance joining a team with him in charge. While Verstappen remains a potential target for Aston Horner is unlikely to be worth taking the risk of alienating their prize for.Now his deal is done Horner will surely be considering these and other options, albeit with the Alpine path seeming most likely. However, he may yet also play a waiting game. With major regulation changes due next season, including new engines, there may be no little upheaval in the air by mid-2026. Teams that have adapted badly and are off the pace will be looking for fresh blood and Horner would make for an enormously enticing proposition. His time at Red Bull might have ended in turbulence but it is extremely doubtful he has lost his touch.Explore more on these topicsChristian HornerFormula OneMotor sportRed BullcommentShareReuse this content"

Today, the nation’s successful clubs and leagues (which can merely mean the ones that didn’t collapse and fold), tend to have something in common: A home stadium that they control. By building or owning the place where the soccer is played, the franchisees or operator-owners, and by extension the leagues themselves, found a way to grow the sport in the US in a more sustainable, stable manner.It’s a dynamic that has long since taken root inMLS, where 23 of the league’s 30 teams play in soccer-specifc stadiums. But, with the World Cup on the horizon, a real legacy within US soccer is already being built in the shape of striking, sensibly sized soccer venues for smaller teams, including many in the lower divisions.USL adds ex-Carlyle Group CEO as vice chair with eye toward new first divisionRead moreWomen’s soccer has been an integral part of this stadium boom. The NWSL and the USL Super League, already operate as parallel Division I leagues, which in some ways has paved the way for USL to attempt the same in the men’s game. Many women’s teams share soccer-specific stadiums with the men, but in 2024,Kansas City Current’s CPKC Stadiumbecame the first in the world to be built specifically for a women’s soccer team. Teams like Tampa Bay Sun (USL) and Denver Summit FC (NWSL) have plans to do the same.On the men’s side, US Soccer’s pro league standards have minimum requirements for teams wanting to participate in a top-tier league, which includes a minimum stadium capacity of 15,000. This has led to teams revamping existing facilities, or building brand new ones, as they make their case to be among the first group of teams to take a place in a new Division I.In the United Soccer League (USL), the organization that oversees most lower-division soccer in the US, stadium building has been such a prominent part of plans that the league has its own chief real estate officer. The league hastaken on new investmentwith an eye to expand its real estate portfolio, especially important given itsplans to launch a D1 league in 2028and institute promotion and relegation.A rundown of stadium projects with capacities 15,000 and below in the United StatesThe issue of promotion and relegation is often looked at through rose-colored glasses, focusing on the idea of teams growing, improving, and moving up the leagues, but often ignoring those going in the other direction. A pro/rel system will only work if the teams dropping down a division, or even two, can survive such a fate and remain relevant and stable within their markets. For proof of how a stadium can improve those prospects, one need only look at MLS.From 2003, when an original 1996 MLS franchise, LA Galaxy, moved to a new stadium now known as Dignity Health Sports Park, MLS’s expansion was as much about new stadiums as it was new franchises. When the new teams began to arrive in 2005, they often did so with soccer-specific stadiums or at least plans for one.“The league could have disappeared, and spent 12 to 15 years worrying about collapsing more than growth,” says David Gass, founder and host of the Soccerwise podcast. “But the way you ensure that you exist is by having a physical representation of yourself, and building a stadium means ‘we’re going to be here, we have this building, we are part of this city, we have a physical footprint.’skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A soccer team is going to play in Nashville, for example, for the next 20-plus years, no matter what happens, because the building has been built, the facility is there, and the fan engagement has been created.“Let’s say something happens to MLS or Nashville SC, someone else is going to take over that space, the same as we’ve seen in minor league baseball and college football, and I think that’s a pretty big step to take in terms of ensuring the future.”Only three MLS teams (the New England Revolution, New York City FC, and Chicago Fire) are playing in stadiums that feel like lodgings rather than homes, and New York and Chicago have plans to move into their own soccer-specific stadiums in 2027 and 2028, respectively.Chicago Fire’s previous attempt at such a move was an example of what can go wrong, but the downtown location of the proposed site at South Loop in the heart of the city should mean there is no repeat of the problems encountered out in Bridgeview.Even some of the teams that play in facilities shared with NFL franchises, like Atlanta, Charlotte, and Seattle, feel more like homeowners than lodgers. “Many in Atlanta think of the Mercedes-Benz Stadium, not as the Atlanta Falcons stadium that they rent to Atlanta United, but as a stadium that was built largely for the World Cup and for Atlanta United,” says John Parker, CEO ofKickback Soccer Media.“The reason Arthur Blank said he needed it was because he said he needed the World Cup, and Atlanta United, too, and couldn’t do that in the old stadium. It debuted with Atlanta United, and though it’s not soccer-specific, I think you’re going to see more instances where, if the MLS team is really big, the NFL owner is usually the richest guy in town, they’re often going to own the MLS team. I think this is fine, as long as you build it so that it works for soccer, and you treat soccer fans right and not as just second-rate citizens.”Explore more on these topicsUSL ChampionshipBusiness of soccerMLSUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They did not have the requisite quality and Arsenal scored again, the second coming late from Leandro Trossard. There was doggedness in abundance but Vale’s inability to have a shot on target summed up their shortcomings.Arsenal, Spurs, Man City and Newcastle through to Carabao Cup fourth round – follow the draw liveRead moreThe hosts offered the anticipated blood-and-thunder approach in the opening seconds of the match, spurred on by the biggest Vale Park crowd this century. But before the smoke from the pre-match pyrotechnics settled,Arsenalwere in control and ahead. Gabriel Martinelli found Eze in the middle of the box in the eighth minute, aided by a Myles Lewis‑Skelly dummy, and the former Crystal Palace playmaker calmly placed the ball beyond Joe Gauci.“I’ve been waiting to score for this club for a long time and the first is very special,” Eze said.Mikel Arteta put out a strong team, the only debutant being the world’s most expensive goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga. For all their domination, enjoying more than 80% possession in the match, Arsenal did not test Gauci until Mikel Merino flicked the ball through for Eze but the goalkeeper was off his line quickly to block. Port Vale hassled their way back into the game, lifting the crowd through work-rate as they did their best to pressurise the Gunners. Considering how early Arsenal took the lead, the League One side were boosted by reaching half-time with a single-goal deficit.View image in fullscreenLeandro Trossard doubles Arsenal’s lead in the 86th minute.Photograph: Chris Radburn/ReutersArsenal needed something to silence the majority inside Vale Park but were unable to find their rhythm against a team set up to frustrate. There was greater confidence in the Vale ranks the longer the score stayed at 1-0. They were more eager to send the ball into the Arsenal box and make them think, rather than the conservative approach that was the hallmark of the opening 45 minutes. “In the second half we lost a little bit of grip of the game, especially with the direct play, with all the throws from the sidelines and winning territory and then again,” Arteta said. “We lacked a bit of dominance and control.”Quick GuideCarabao Cup fourth-round drawShowArsenal v Brighton & Hove AlbionGrimsby Town v BrentfordSwansea City v Manchester CityNewcastle United v TottenhamWrexham v CardiffLiverpool v Crystal PalaceWolves v ChelseaWycombe Wanderers v FulhamMatches to be played w/c 27 OctoberWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.If the idea was to get players into a rhythm, Bukayo Saka struggled to cause Vale problems. He was slow in possession and rarely had a chance to run at the defence, often needing to turn back. Saka was booed off in the 63rd minute by the home supporters, who were upset by his reaction to an earlier challenge.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Port Vale could have equalised if they were more dynamic after a misplaced Cristhian Mosquera pass across his own box and a rising drive from Devante Cole kept Arrizabalaga interested until the last second when it whistled over the bar.Instead of celebrating, supporters were silenced, apart from complaints about a potential offside, when a direct ball from William Saliba found Trossard. The substitute took a few touches and fired into the bottom corner from the edge of the box to send Arsenal into the next round and break Vale hearts.“To see this ground packed,” the Port Vale manager, Darren Moore, said of the positives to be taken. “I told the boys if they can bottle tonight and take it into the league we won’t go far wrong. We played an elite team with a top manager. I am proud of the boys tonight.”Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupPort ValeArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Because there have been a few of those since 3 February 2024, when they began a surge from the lower reaches of League Two.Grant McCann’s team missed out on promotion via the playoffs, then went up as champions last season and they have started well in League One this time out. During the period, they have collected 143 points; no team in England has more.Phil Foden pulls strings as Manchester City outclass Huddersfield in Carabao CupRead moreTottenham, though, were always likely to prove too much for them. Thomas Frank made it clear when he was unveiled as the club’s manager that he wanted them to compete in all four competitions they were in, and they are up and running in theCarabao Cup.Spurs impressed in the first half, fluffing up a two-goal cushion and, if they coasted after the interval, they never looked in danger of leaving the back-door open, of offering any encouragement for the fairytale.João Palhinha’s goal for 1-0 was the standout moment and after a Jay McGrath own goal it was Brennan Johnson – a threat on the right throughout – who completed the scoring at the very end.It is the Premier League manager who is supposed to make the most changes to his lineup and Frank could have picked a powerful XI from those he started among the substitutes, rested entirely or was unable to select because of injury. Yet McCann outdid his seven changes with nine of his own, the Doncaster manager staying true to his rotation policy in this competition. When he changed all 11 players for the first-round tie at Middlesbrough, his team won 4-0.Doncaster travelled with optimism; their travelling band of 4,000 supporters with characteristic Yorkshire confidence. It was punctured early on when it became clear that Spurs had the pace and skill to hurt them up the wings. How did Mathys Tel miss his kick from point-blank range from a Johnson cross at the outset? It was a mystery.View image in fullscreenJoão Palhinha jumps for joy after scoring an especially fine goal for a centre-half.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PASpurs did not dwell on it and they were ahead when the Doncaster goalkeeper, Ian Lawlor, made a hash of his punch on a Xavi Simons corner and compounded the error by feeling his momentum take him away from goal. Seán Grehan did not get enough distance on the clearing header and Palhinha, who played at centre-half, adjusted his feet before hooking the ball over his shoulder and into the empty net. It was anything but a centre-half’s finish.Spurs made it 2-0 when Wilson Odobert skated past Tom Nixon and crossed low. Lawlor could get nothing on it and the ball went in off the unfortunate McGrath, who was facing the wrong way.It was possible to fear for Doncaster because they were loose at the back, Spurs moving around and through them too easily, the spaces big, the chances coming. When Archie Gray, who played as a right-sided No 8, popped up in the left of the area on to a breaking ball and shaped a curler for the far corner, Lawlor made a fine save.Doncaster came to play. They had flickered at the very start, Toyosi Olusanya fluffing one chance when well placed while there was the moment on 39 minutes when the captain, Owen Bailey, sculpted a lovely volley that Antonin Kinsky pushed against a post.View image in fullscreenBrennan Johnson scores Tottenham’s third goal past Doncaster’s Ian Lawlor.Photograph: Jacques Feeney/Offside/Getty ImagesDoncaster brought the tempo after the second-half restart, trying to get on to the front foot and ask questions. The No 10, Joe Sbarra, flitted with intent while Bailey looked polished in his deeper midfield role. Frank seemed happy to contain, to play on the counter.It felt as though Spurs were sleepwalking a little, the home crowd were subdued – apart from the screaming kids behind the press box – and there were a few worries for Frank, chiefly another dreadfully scuffed finish from Tel. It was disappointing to see a dive in the area from Pedro Porro, for which he was booked.Quick GuideCarabao Cup fourth-round drawShowArsenal v Brighton & Hove AlbionGrimsby Town v BrentfordSwansea City v Manchester CityNewcastle United v TottenhamWrexham v CardiffLiverpool v Crystal PalaceWolves v ChelseaWycombe Wanderers v FulhamMatches to be played w/c 27 OctoberWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Doncaster, though, could not make it happen. Glenn Middletone swelled the side-netting with a free-kick after Kevin Danso had wafted a high boot at Brandon Hanlan, on as a substitute, and it was Spurs who finished the stronger.Frank was able to introduce the 16-year-old Luca Williams-Barnett for his debut on the left and the final word went to Johnson, who finished after being released by another substitute, Lucas Bergvall.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupTottenham HotspurDoncaster Roversmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Football doesn’t work like that – we conceded one chance, in 88 or 89 minutes, and I know from my 10 ­seasons away in the FA Cup orCarabao Cup[playing teams] in the Championship or League One it is tricky – we have always behaved really good.”Guardiola believes Foden is again the force he was 18 months ago. “We have seen already in the last few games – against Arsenal, Napoli and United he was really good,” the manager said. “Phil when playing that position [behind the striker] is a real threat.”Only Foden and Nico O’Reilly were retained from City’s 1-1 draw at Arsenal, with James Trafford given a first start between the sticks since Gianluigi Donnarumma’s signing on transfer deadline day, and Divine Mukasa his debut. The 18-year-old, listed as a midfielder and operating as the No 9, saw a shot blocked, then his header from Foden’s corner gathered by Lee Nicholls, Town’s keeper.Lee Grant’s team had defeated Leicester and Sunderland, both on penalties, in previous rounds, so this tie was the reward in a 13th game of his nascent managerial career. The former Manchester United ­goalkeeper told his men to press, from Dion Charles at the tip to the backline, but the ball moved as quick as the opponents’ collective brain.As for Foden’s opener: the No 47 drifted into a right-hand pocket, received Matheus Nunes’s pass and turned and fed Mukasa, who returned the ball. At long range, Foden executed an expert low finish.View image in fullscreenManchester City’s Savinho scores their second goal in the win at Huddersfield.Photograph: Ed Sykes/Action Images/ReutersCity’s possession was north of 80% and Foden seemed to enjoy most of it, as he orchestrated the contest. Stones was Guardiola’s nominated captain and Foden the spiritual leader, who sprayed balls left to Savinho, popped along the right to feed Oscar Bobb, wandered over to deliver a corner, then rushed back when Town broke.City’s stranglehold raised the premium of any glimmer for Grant’s team so Zépiqueno Redmond’s blast over in the visitors’ area was significant.Foden showed far more composure when he took over in midfield and curved a ball into Rico Lewis; the No 82’s pass into Town’s area was then the correct option, the lack of a colleague to meet it a travesty.Now, though, ­Redmond did far better. He swooped along the left and fed Ben Wiles, whose attempt gave City their first scare, careering past Trafford’s goal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Next up, Savinho dribbled infield and unloaded: the ball went wide of Nicholls’s right post and City seemed right to claim a corner for a deflection that the referee, Michael Salisbury, was not interested in.Instantly City had their hands on Town’s throats again but O’Reilly was ­unable to escape Nicholls’s clutches. Moments later Redmond was, once more, unable to keep his attempt down near Trafford’s goal.Quick GuideCarabao Cup fourth-round drawShowArsenal v Brighton & Hove AlbionGrimsby Town v BrentfordSwansea City v Manchester CityNewcastle United v TottenhamWrexham v CardiffLiverpool v Crystal PalaceWolves v ChelseaWycombe Wanderers v FulhamMatches to be played w/c 27 OctoberWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Kalvin Phillips, whose last City appearance was on 19 December 2023 at the Club World Cup, was spotted of a group of substitutes warming up, and the midfielder watched on when Sean Roughan lifted a rare Town free-kick into the area – Murray Wallace headed over but City knew the game was not yet closed out.Phillips entered on 83 minutes to jeers because of his Leeds United connection; then ­Cameron Ashia hit Trafford’s left post to give Town’s fans a highlight to recall.Of Phillips, Guardiola said: “Yester­day he was a father to Ari and he came this morning from London and is now going back to his wife and the kids.”Grant said he was “super-proud of the group”.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupHuddersfieldManchester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It was not quite raining goals for Eddie Howe’s side but two apiece from Joelinton and Will Osula at least showed they remembered how to score, on a night when Bruno Guimarães excelled in midfield.Granted, Graham Alexander’sBradfordbelong to the third tier but the League One leaders proved competitive and well-organised opponents who thoroughly deserved their own consolation goal, registered, evocatively, by their Newcastle-supporting No 9, Andy Cook.‘I screamed the house down at the draw’: Bradford’s Andy Cook on facing NewcastleRead more“We wanted to entertain,” said Howe, whose team will face Tottenham at home in the fourth round. “But it wasn’t easy, we needed to be patient. Now we just want to keep going in this competition again.”It is sometimes easy to forget that Joelinton originally joined Newcastle as a £40m centre-forward. Howe eventually discovered the Brazilian to be an infinitely better midfielder but when the rebound from Anthony Gordon’s blocked shot fell his way here, Joelinton’s muscle memory kicked in and the resultant low shot settled his side’s early nerves.Until then Bradford had frequently succeeded in disrupting Newcastle’s one and two touch passing rhythm, with Aaron Ramsdale doing well to save Bobby Pointon’s deflected shot.Once in front, though, Howe’s team seized control. With the £70m Germany striker Nick Woltemade starting on the bench again, Osula had another chance to prove his worth.This time, he took it. Two minutes after Joelinton’s opener, Osula collected a gorgeous pass from Guimarães, retained his poise and, left one-on-one with Sam Walker, swept a fine shot beyond the goalkeeper’s reach.As a senior player coming to the end of his career at Burnley a decade and a half ago, Alexander had clashed with a young manager named Eddie Howe. These days fences have long since been mended but Alexander, who, at 53, is six years his Newcastle counterpart’s senior, readily admits that, back at Turf Moor, they could not stand each other.View image in fullscreenJoelinton may have been converted to a midfielder, but his striker’s touch has not deserted him.Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PANow Howe, who acknowledges he should probably have played Alexander more frequently, had the upper hand again.With Guimarães glittering and Lewis Miley gradually asserting himself in midfield, Newcastle were passing and moving with pleasing fluency. Only a strong save on Walker’s part denied Osuala a second goal yet the stadium was unusually quiet; more a library than the citadel of sound that greeted Barcelona here last Thursday.Quick GuideCarabao Cup fourth-round drawShowArsenal v Brighton & Hove AlbionGrimsby Town v BrentfordSwansea City v Manchester CityNewcastle United v TottenhamWrexham v CardiffLiverpool v Crystal PalaceWolves v ChelseaWycombe Wanderers v FulhamMatches to be played w/c 27 OctoberWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“Where’s your famous atmosphere,” chorused the 4,900 Bradford fans who had made the 100-mile road trip from West Yorkshire. Alexander’s players responded by refusing to fold but their best attacking moves tended to founder in the face of the immensely impressive Sven Botman, finally fit again, and his new partner Malick Thiaw.No matter; for a team promoted from League Two only this spring, Bradford are evidently on a steep upward trajectory and never looked overawed by their multimillion-pound hosts. They might even have pulled a goal back had Stephen Humphrys not directed a header straight at Ramsdale after meeting Pointon’s clever delivery.On the hour, Alexander made Cook’s evening by liberating the No 9 from the bench. Cook grew up idolising Alan Shearer and, in playing at St James’ Park for the first time, he finally fulfilled a longstanding dream. Before the 34-year-old could make his mark, though, Joelinton scored his second goal of the night, showing Gordon and Anthony Elanga how to finish.View image in fullscreenIt may have just been a consolation, but scoring at St James’ Park was a dream come true for Andy Cook.Photograph: George Wood/Getty ImagesThat pair had missed opportunities to increase the scoreline but now Joelinton’s steadying touch and assured left-foot finish following another smart Guimarães pass ruined Bradford’s night.Or had it? Undeterred, Cook, recently recovered from an anterior cruciate ligament rupture, responded by scoring the best goal of the night. When Newcastle failed to clear, he was perfectly placed to smash a stupendous half-volley in off the crossbar.As Bradford’s entire bench applauded, sustained chants of “Andy, Andy Cook” echoed down from the Leazes End. “It’s something Andy will always remember,” said Alexander. “But Newcastle are very strong, they showed they’re a Champions League team.”But there was still time for Osula to lash home his second goal as Newcastle sealed that fourth-round tie with Spurs and Bradford banked a very welcome sum of around £350,000 from their excursion to Tyneside.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupNewcastle UnitedBradfordmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Once inside, an image of Beard and his trademark smile was displayed on a screen above a table where red and white flowers – one bouquet accompanied by a handwritten note expressing love from Sunderland – lay next to the books of condolence that were quickly filling up with messages of love.The scene was so sombre, it was, momentarily, difficult to imagine there was a game of football to watch, but soon the Liverpool fans were inside the stadium for the first match since the news ofBeard’s sudden death at the age of 47.The attendance was – as expected for a League Cup group-stage fixture against lower-league opposition – on the low side but more than 4,000 will be in this ground on Sunday when Liverpool host Manchester United in the Women’s Super League and the tributes to Beard will continue. Still, the Wednesday match programmes, dedicated to Beard, all rapidly sold out.Among the crowd were Beard’s brother, Mark, and his mother, Margaret, as well as several players from Beard’s time in charge, including the former England and Liverpool striker Natasha Dowie.View image in fullscreenMatt Beard’s contribution to the club will be fondly remembered by supporters.Photograph: Nick Taylor/Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesThe players walked out to an emotional rendition of You’ll Never Walk Alone, which was sung quietly, like the gentle whisper of a prayer compared with the roaring versions usually heard at Anfield, but the sound was no less stirring. The coaching staff of both teams all linked arm-in-arm before a moment’s silence was observed impeccably.And while in many ways the outcome of the game had scarcely felt less important, it was also a salient time for Liverpool to secure their first victory of the season – not just for Beard but for themselves, after two defeats from their opening two WSL game.On this emotional night they outplayed Sunderland for a 5-0 victory, much to the delight of their supporters, some of whom waved a flag bearing the words: “Liverpool was made for Matt and Matt was made for Liverpool”.The home fans sang “Matt Beard’s mighty Reds” loudly throughout the 13th and 14th minutes, in reference to the years 2013 and 2014 when Beard led the club to back-to-back WSL titles.View image in fullscreenJenna Clark was one of four Liverpool players to get their names on the score sheet.Photograph: Nick Taylor/Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesBy then, they were already 1-0 up, and fittingly the opening goal had come from Gemma Evans, a player Beard signed for Liverpool in 2024 and had also played under him at Bristol City briefly in 2021. She blew a kiss up towards the sky in celebration after she headed home from Fuka Nagano’s seventh-minute cross.From another header from a defender, this time Jenna Clark, the hosts doubled their lead, and after the game she said: “It’s been a very emotional few days for everyone – we’ve pulled through as a team as best as we could.”Risa Shimizu scored the goal of the night as she skilfully lobbed the goalkeeper with a volley. Sophie Román Haug, on as a substitute, added two close-range finishes in the second half to complete the rout.Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballLiverpool FC WomenSunderland WomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was subjected to racial abuse in my DMs. Racism in any form is unacceptable and [it] is important to address this behaviour and ensure that steps are taken to prevent it from happening again.”The game finished 0-0 in normal time, before the hosts Tottenham won 7-6 in a penalty shootout to claim an extra point for the group stage.There were also wins in the opening group games on Wednesday for Manchester City, Nottingham Forest, Leicester City, London City Lionesses, West Ham, Brighton and Liverpool, while Sheffield United and Birmingham City – like Tottenham – both claimed two points after penalty-shootout victories.Explore more on these topicsTottenham Hotspur WomenWomen's footballRaceOnline abusenewsShareReuse this content"

But in playing the last two minutes of Spalding’s backs-to-the-wall away win atBurySt Edmunds, Lewis White was carrying a guilty secret: he had gone to the wrong Bury first.The 24-year-old had travelled for the Southern Football League Premier central fixture against Bury Town under his own steam and driven from his home in Leicestershire. Instead of heading east to Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, however, he drove north to Bury in Greater Manchester, and added 200 miles to his journey in the process.First reportedby LincsOnline, White appears to have driven all the way to Bury FC’s Gigg Lane before realising his error. After schlepping back down the A14, he arrived at Getaway Cars Stadium, home of Bury Town, in time to help close out victory for the Tulips, with Spalding winning 2-1 despite playing with 10 men.Their manager, Jimmy Dean, said: “I asked the people at Bury if it had ever happened before and they said it hadn’t,. He must have been in a world of his own, but he’s come and helped see the game out for us and it’s always a fantastic feeling to win a midweek match.”Spalding moved up to fourth on the back of the result, ahead of Quorn on goal difference but four points off the leaders, Harborough. Their next fixture is an FA Cup qualifying round fixture against Dagenham & Redbridge on Saturday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While Messi famously wheeled away in celebration, removed his shirt andpointedly held it upin front of the Bernabéu crowd after scoring a late, late winner for Barcelona in a five-goal thriller at Real Madrid in 2017, Ekitiké has now rather more infamously done the same thing after scoring a tap-in from an excellent Federico Chiesa assist against Championship opposition in the third round of Fizzy Cup. And while both players were routinely shown yellow cards for what has now been a bookable offence for more than 20 years, at least the one brandished in the direction of Messi was only his first of the match, so he wasn’t sent off.“The first one was already needless and, to a certain extent, stupid, as you have got to control your emotions,” seethed Arne Slot of the first yellow his striker was shown for an act of dissent. “With the second one I told him that if you score in the [Bigger Cup] final in the 87th minute after outplaying three players and hitting it in the top corner … I can maybe understand he is like: ‘This is all about me.’ But I’m old-fashioned. If I scored a goal like this I’d have walked up to Federico Chiesa and said: ‘This goal is all about you, this is not about me.’ Needless, not smart … I called it stupid right away.” While the price of Ekitiké’s act of over-exuberance is a one-match ban that rules him out of Liverpool’s trip to Crystal Palace this weekend, he may find himself on the periphery for longer now that Alexander Isak has opened his account for the Reds and is fast approaching full fitness.Issuing an apology on Social Media Disgrace Instachat that could scarcely have been more sheepish if had been covered in wool while being herded into a pen by a border collie, Ekitiké explained that “the emotion got the better of me tonight” and issued multiple “apologies to all the Red family”. In the fullness of time, when it’s OK for him to look back and laugh at his own tomfoolery, he may even take perverse pleasure in discovering he has become a member of a different kind of “red family” – specifically one whose members also forgot they had already been booked before deciding to disrobe as part of late goal celebrations.Last year, Amad Diallo was dismissedin similar circumstancesafter scoring Manchester United’s winner in an FA Cup quarter-final against Liverpool, while Cameroon’s Vincent Aboubakaralso received his marching ordersfor taking off his shirt in celebration after scoring what would prove to be the only goal of the game for Cameroon against Brazil at the last World Cup. Despite seeing his Southampton side lose 2-1 at Anfield, Will Still was certainly able to see the funny side of the early departure of a young player he knows from his days at Reims. “Hugo cracks me up,” he honked. “He’s a funny lad. We caught up before the game, and he said he’d come on and score and then give me a shirt and bugger off, which is exactly what he’s done.”LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Rob Smyth from 7.45pm BST for red-hot Bigger Vase goal updates , while Scott Murray will be on hand at the same time with a Milk Cup clockwatch.QUOTE OF THE DAY I“When we defend deeper it is because the other [team] are better or we are sh!t. I prefer us to regain the ball high up the pitch, [have] a lot of possession to disturb the structure of the opponents and try to punish them. It’s always been like that and always will be like that. If it doesn’t happen it is because we were bad, not because we want to [be defensive]” – Pep Guardioladefends his, at times, José Mourinho-style tactics that earned the team a draw at Arsenal.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersQUOTE OF THE DAY II“How can you be dominant against such a team if you have … what was the word that was used?

I will learn more to have a different vision” – Mikel Artetadefends his, at times, José Mourinho-style tactics that earned the team a draw against Manchester City.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Javier García/ShutterstockFOOTBALL DAILY LETTERSI am already bored with the current trend of Liverpool grabbing a winner by way of a late goal in so many games. The ‘will they/won’t they’ has all but disappeared and jeopardy is obviously important as a neutral. The predictability is on a par with an episode of Columbo. As the viewer, already party to the guest star character’s guilt, you know that Columbo is absolutely going to nail the killer with a novel demonstration of how they committed their supposed ‘perfect murder’. Liverpool now allow teams to believe they have snatched a very hard and well-earned point before turning to them in the dying seconds and saying: ‘Oh, just one more thing …’ Perhaps the opposition managers should be replaced by stars such as William Shatner or Faye Dunaway (not many other former Columbo guest stars survive) – Tony Forrest.Martin O’Neill hits the nail squarely on the head (yesterday’s Quote of the Day). The nonsense of expected goals and the rest of the infinite analysis of seemingly every second of every game and the ever increasing level of statistics is drowning what is basically a simple game. Bill Nicholson summed it up many years ago: ‘Just score one more goal than the other side.’ Another of his tenets was: ‘Keep it simple but keep it quick.’ I, for one, would be happy if journalists would apply the latter. More in hope than anticipation” – Stewart McGuinness.Re: players booked for taking a free-kick too quickly (yesterday’s Football Daily letters). I was at Loftus Road in October 2009 watching Reading away at QPR. In the first half Ben Watson picked up his second yellow card for taking a free-kick too soon, prompting celebrations among Reading fans. It all went a bit wrong a few seconds later when the replacement taker, Akos Buzsaky, happily curled it past Adam Federici in goal, the first of four for QPR in their victory that night” – Richard Moseley.If you have any, please send letters tothe.boss@theguardian.com.Today’s winner of our letter o’ the day is … Tony Forrest, who wins some Football Weekly merch.

At his spiritual home, Headingley, a minute’s applause was observed, the players lining up on the pitch, and a bouquet of flowers and trademark umpire’s white cap placed on Bird’s dressing‑room balcony chair.Bird, who funded the balcony in 2015, would have enjoyed the first five overs of the day whenYorkshirereduced their fellow relegation candidatesDurhamto seven for two, but 93 from David Bedingham and an unbeaten 87 from Ben Raine turned the tables.Yorkshireneed eight more points to be sure of Division One cricket next year, Durham may require a win because ofSurrey’s impression of a soggy paper bag at the hands of fellow strugglersHampshire.Surrey, champions for three years on the bounce, needed a maximum point win to put pressure on the leaders,Nottinghamshire. But, albeit with a side weakened by illness and the withdrawal of England players, they were dismissed for just 147, their lowest total of the season. Dan Lawrence top scored with 36. There were three wickets each for James Fuller, Washington Sundar and Kyle Abbott, who passed fifty wickets for the summer for the sixth time. Hampshire then sailed calmly to a seven-run lead at stumps.All of which was music to the ears ofNottinghamshire, who bowled outWarwickshirefor 258 in a frenetic last session and now need just two more points – 300 runs – to secure the title.Warwickshirehad revived at 244 for five but lost their last five wickets for 14 runs, Dan Mousley last man out for 74.Elsewhere, Steve Eskinazi made a first century forLeicestershireagainstNorthamptonshire,Middlesex’s captain, Leus du Plooy, biffed an unbeaten 171 againstGloucestershire, theSomersetacademy graduate Josh Thomas hit a run-a-ball fifty on his championship debut proper, and James Rew his fifth 50 of the summer to frustrateEssex, who remain in relegation danger.After a season of wrangling, meetings, more meetings, letters and votes, the England and Wales Cricket Board announced that the motion to remodel theCounty Championshipstructure had not received the required two-thirds majority of votes it needed to pass. The 18 first-class counties were tied at 9-9, which means the current two-division 14-game, two up, two down, competition remains.The announcement drew an immediate retort from the Professional Cricketers’ Association. The union’s chief executive, Daryl Mitchell, said the current structure was “not fit for purpose,” while its chair, Olly Hannon-Dalby, said: “Over the past two years, we have seen increasing levels of genuine concern for player health and wellbeing and as an association we represented this in the strongest possible way. Ultimately the required minimum number of 12 county chairs did not see player welfare as a priority.”Share"

If so, the final act wasbravely walking out to bat in a sling at the Oval.“It’s been as tough a time for someone,” Key said. “In cricket terms, it is the timing of it as much as anything else and the chance of reoccurrence [of the injury]. He was running out of time to be ready for the start of the Ashes. Then once you get out of an Ashes series you’re often looking at the next cycle, really. So Chris Woakes isn’t in our plans at the minute.”If Woakes’s injury underlined the unforgiving nature of international sport, the same can be said of Pope’s removal as vice-captain. After three years in the role, the demotion comes on the eve of an Ashes tour that will define the Test project under Key, Stokes and the head coach, Brendon McCullum.Key insisted it came down to Brook, the white-ball captain, simply being a better leader but is aware that, withJacob Bethell’s star on the rise, he has reopened pandora’s box as regards thedebate around the No 3 spot. Pope, who he said was at ease with the call, was given no assurances, however.“We think now is the right time,” Key said. “It’s pretty simple, really. When Popey has [captained], he’s done it well. He’s fitted into so many different roles. Harry Brook is just the better leader and will be the better leader going forward, so that’s why he gets that job.“There is not like an elaborate scheme where if we take the vice‑captaincy off Ollie Pope it makes him easier to drop. It doesn’t matter if you are vice-captain or not. If we don’t feel you are the right person – whether that’s an opener or No 5 – we’ll bring in someone we think can do the job better.View image in fullscreenRob Key (left), Brendon McCullum (centre) and Ben Stokes have chosen their 16-man England squad for the Ashes.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PA“At the moment, Ollie Pope is the man in possession [at No 3]. There is a white-ball series [against New Zealand] that Jacob Bethell is playing in, things like that. You never make your decisions too early because things happen. We tend to leave the decisions as late as possible.”When asked if Brook was therefore the next Test captain, Key replied: “Who knows? I might not be in this job when that decision is made.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The expectation, however, is that seamers will dominate the wicket charts.On that score Key expressed no concerns about Mark Wood’s inclusion after knee surgery and a year without first-class cricket, citing his record of building towards Test matches through training. If fit, Wood will augment an attack that, with Jofra Archer, Gus Atkinson, Byrdon Carse and Josh Tongue, is already blessed with more pace than witnessed on previous tours.Key said: “I’m probably more excited than anybody who has to face them. We’ve worked so hard to get to this point. This is the last little step, get it right and hopefully we have every option available to us going into that first Test. That may be Wood and Archer together, it may not.“But to have that battery of bowlers, every one of them fit … fingers crossed, but that is the exciting thing.

There was more discussion over possible rule changes at a meeting in central London on Tuesday, but no vote. The likelihood is that the executive will call a vote in November, with sources arguing the issue needs to be resolved. If a vote is not called, or fails to pass, the chances of any new system being introduced by next season will fall away.Sources suggest discussions at the meeting on Tuesday were focused on addressing issues raised by individual clubs, with perspectives often diverging according to a club’s position within the competition. One of the two proposals, known as the squad-cost ratio, would limit spending on wages to 85% of revenue. Nine of the league’s 20 clubs are already committed to such a system as a result of qualifying for Europe and are understood to value the flexibility PSR provides domestically.The second proposal, known as anchoring, would limit spending for all clubs to a multiple of the revenues of the bottom-placed side. It has provoked further dissent, with Manchester United and Manchester City among the clubs to have voted against such plans in the past. The case for the rules was made again, with clubs in favour arguing anchoring could be key to maintaining the league’s competitive balance, seen as one of the selling points for the competition at home and abroad.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Levy left the board suddenly this month after 25 years as the club’s most senior director and has been replaced by Peter Charrington, a long-time adviser of the Lewis family who own ENIC, as non-executive chairman. In other significant changes Lewis’ children, Vivienne and Charles, have become more involved at Tottenham without taking formal positions on the board.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Europe face broader challenges after the USA team member Collin Morikawa called for home fans to cause “absolute chaos” for the visitors. Morikawa believes the early part of Ryder Cup week has proved “tame”.Trump’s arrival on the first day of the 45thRyder Cupwill trigger airport-style checks for fans and a ban on several items including folding chairs, umbrellas and vapes. The Bethpage gates will open at the unprecedented time of 5am, more than two hours before play gets under way, in an attempt to alleviate an inevitably tricky situation. Security bubbles and additional screening will be in place around certain areas where Trump could be present.Trump looms large at Ryder Cup where home rules and spicy support are always on showRead moreThe focus of Rose and his European teammates is on retaining the trophy won in Rome two years ago. The Englishman, who is taking part in his seventh Ryder Cup, revealed he does not expect the US president to appear on the 1st tee and promised Europe will not lose their focus from the task in hand.“Obviously he is going to bring certainly a lot of attention and patriotism to the event,” said Rose of Trump. “I don’t think he’s going to necessarily be on the tee box with us or roaming the course. So from that point of view, I think there will just be a lot of noise around it but I’m not sure there will be the continued distraction of it. I could be wrong, just based upon what I’ve heard, how they’re going to handle his movements around the property.“Listen, it’s great for golf that he’s engaged in the game and obviously he brings a lot of eyeballs with him. Fan-wise, I’m sure Friday afternoon will be certainly very intense and entertaining.”Rose’s comments suggest Trump will take the advice of the PGA of America and appear for the second rather than opening session on Friday. The Ryder Cup organisers had asked the White House to ensure the president did not come in the morning, in an attempt to alleviate security pressures at this 1400-acre site. About 50,000 spectators are expected at Bethpage on each tournament day.Security around Trump has been intensified by the recent killing of Charlie Kirk. On Wednesday morning, Ryder Cup organisers announced a string of measures never previously encountered at the biennial event. “Ticketed attendees are strongly urged to arrive as early as possible and should budget extra time as they plan their day,” said a PGA of America statement.“In addition to security screening at the entrance, spectators will be subjected to TSA [Transportation Security Administration]-style screening points around the clubhouse, adjacent grandstand and surrounding areas. If spectators leave these secure areas, they will need to be screened again prior to reentering that area.“Gates will open for ticket holders at 5am. Guests should make every effort to restrict personal items to a minimum.“Guests should expect temporary delays moving around publicly accessible areas inside and outside of the Bethpage Black golf course. These areas may briefly become restricted or frozen spaces before, during or after the event.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Items banned in the vicinity of the 1st hole are portable folding chairs, large vapes, torch-style lighters, metal or hard plastic beverage containers and large umbrellas.Morikawa did his bit to crank up pressure on Europe. “I think it’s kind of tame so far,” said the two-time major winner. “I hope Friday is just absolute chaos. I’m all for it. I think it feeds into who we are as the American team. We want it. We want to use that to our advantage. I think we really have to tap into that.“I hope they come strong. Watching all these kids, I know they want autographs, but come Friday I hope they go crazy.”A further layer of Ryder Cup complication has been added by a forecast of thunder storms in this part of Long Island.

The US team trounced Europe 19-9 at Whistling Straits four years ago.Paul McGinleyfound himself under scrutiny as part of a European Ryder Cup committee that also includes Damon Buffini, Richard Scudamore and Ian Ritchie.“The narrative was that this was a tired European team and there were no players coming through the ranks to change things against young, dynamic Americans who have figured out how to win Ryder Cups,” McGinley says.Trump looms large at Ryder Cup where home rules and spicy support are always on showRead more“People said they were going to win the next 10. It’s fair to say I got a bit of a talking to from that committee about taking a more active role in overseeing what we were doing.”McGinley was involved when thetrophy was reclaimed by Europe in Rome. Soon, his position was formalised to strategic adviser to Luke Donald. This was a smart appointment; McGinley has forgotten more about the Ryder Cup than most will ever know. At Bethpage, he will be on the sidelines but will provide an important sounding board as Donald and his players try to break the mould with a win on the road.“We have nailed the home Ryder Cup templates but we have not nailed the away ones,” McGinley says. “If we go out and lose by five or six points again, that will be crushing for us. I don’t see that happening. If we don’t win, I think we will narrow the gap of away match defeats. We may well nick a win, we have a strong team.”Europe have also left nothing to chance. McGinley was lauded for his attention to detail as captain in 2014. More than a decade on, there was a scouting trip to Bethpage and virtual reality headsets were given to players so that they could sample how ferocious the opening tee may be. Is this the best prepared European team ever? “I think that’s fair to say, including the one I captained,” McGinley says. “This is another level up now.“One of the things that has grown exponentially behind the scenes is the cost to prepare the team for the Ryder Cup. The budget that we are spending runs into the millions in terms of preparing this team. Sports scientists, data, food, dietitians making trips out there to meet chefs and see the kitchen or share recipes. America has decided the players will be paid whereas we put our money back into the DP World Tour as well as into the preparation of the team. The money spent on preparing the team is a massive multiple of what it was in my day.”The influential figures behind Donald will be worthy of high praise if Europe prevail. Like McGinley, the performance coach Owen Eastwood is a crucial source of advice for the captain. Edoardo Molinari, one of Europe’s vice‑captains, is a statistical guru. It was therefore no coincidence that Europe retained not only Donald from Rome but 11 of his 12 players.View image in fullscreenEurope’s golfers lift the Ryder Cup trophy in 2023 after prevailing over the USA at the Marco Simone golf club in Rome.Photograph: David Davies/PA“We have relied heavily on analytics and history when making up what this strategy is,” McGinley says. “Edoardo plays a hugely important role, he is the guy who came up with the qualification system. I think one mistake we were making was hitting the ground with a new captain all the time, trying to learn the job and deal with an away match. Having someone with credibility who would do it again was important.“Data led us in this direction; experienced players, from a European perspective, are the ones who deliver on the road. What we wanted data to do was point us in the right general direction, then we can bring in our golfing IQ and figure out what might work in a Ryder Cup context.”McGinley sat as an interested observer in 2010 as Corey Pavin, the then US captain, revealed advice from Bill Belichick. “Always remember to make the big thing the big thing,” the legendary NFL coach had told Pavin. McGinley says: “You can look for marginal gains, the extra 1-2%, and then lose sight of the big things.“Communication with the players is so important. The biggest challenge here is the crowd, playing in a hostile environment and one players are not used to. They are ducks out of water. What were the lessons under Bernhard Langer [from Oakland Hills in 2004], what were the learnings from Medinah?“I don’t think there has been a captain who has communicated as much to players as Luke has. That detailed, regular communication has been focused on mindset and preparing them for what is going to be a very difficult environment to play in.”Explore more on these topicsRyder Cup 2025Paul McGinleyRyder CupGolfUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Tigers had led the division since 23 April and had a 10-game lead over Cleveland as recently as 6 September. But the Guardians have the best record inMLBthis month (17-5) while the Tigers have lost seven straight games and 10 of their last 11.Cubs’ Matt Shaw defends missing team’s defeat to attend Charlie Kirk’s memorialRead moreWilliams allowed two runs on four hits and walked only two to outduel Tigers ace Tarik Skubal, who gave up three runs (one earned) on four hits while fanning eight and walking three.It was a shaky outing for Skubal, who has been excellent for most of the season. After he hit Cleveland’s David Fry in the face with a pitch, he looked shaken and threw a wild pitch to George Valera, who replaced Fry, allowing Cleveland to score. Skubal also had an error – he inexplicably tried to make a blind throw to first between his legs – and was also called for a balk in the sixth inning as the Guardians rallied for three runs to take a 3-2 lead without hitting a ball out of the infield.“We did a lot of uncharacteristic things, and it’s hurting us,” Tigers manager AJ Hinch said after the game.Fry was taken to a local hospital for observation after being hit by the 99 mph pitch and Skubal admitted the incident had affected him.“Really tough,” said the left-hander. “I’ve already reached out to him. I’m sure his phone is blowing up. I just want to make sure he’s all right. Obviously, he seemed like he was OK coming off the field and hopefully it stays that way.”With the victory, the Guardians now have a better head-to-head record against the Tigers this season and own the tiebreaker over Detroit should the teams finish joint-first in the division.“I feel like we’ve been this way for a couple of series now,” Tigers catcher Dillon Dingler said. “It’s not quite pressing but we definitely feel some of the pressure and we’ve got to mitigate it. We’ve got to eliminate it. We’ve still got to find ways to stay loose, focus in and hone in on what we need to do and go out there and do it.”The teams play each other again on Wednesday and Thursday before the Tigers complete their season with a series against the Red Sox and the Guardians face the Rangers.Explore more on these topicsMLBDetroit TigersCleveland GuardiansBaseballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It had just gone nine in the morning when the speakers started blasting out Village People’s YMCA. Scottie Scheffler, the world No 1, had arrived on the putting green and everyone was whooping and hollering at him. Scheffler bumped fists with one of his coaches, wrapped another up in a hug and, BAH-BA-BADA-BADA-BAH!, walked on up and across the bridge to the practice ground where there was a crowd of 500 or so waiting.They started chanting. “YEW-ESS-AY! YEW-ESS-AY!” Scheffler’s a big man. By the time he made it on to the range he seemed to have swelled twice the size.USA need Ryder Cup glory if they are to escape pay-free Europe’s money talkRead moreThere are a few hundred thousand reasons why the home team wins two out of three editions of theRyder Cup. One of them is the nature of the courses, which, like the English language, are the same, but different either side of the Atlantic. The second is that the captains are allowed to tweak the widths of the fairways, the height of the rough and the speed of the greens to suit their own team.The rest are all paying upwards of $750 to attend. The Ryder Cup always draws the rowdiest crowds in the game. The tribalism, says the US’s Patrick Cantlay, “has become such an integral part of this event, it’s just to be expected”.But this year, no one is sure what is coming.Donald Trumpis due on Friday afternoon and his visit is looming over the tournament like a balloon at the Thanksgiving Day parade.The only thing anyone can predict with any certainty is that Long Island is going to be gridlocked. The organisers, who are already trying to funnel tens of thousands of fans in and out of the grounds, have been in endless negotiations over the arrangements.The US Open men’s tennis final was held up for the best part of an hourwhen Trump decided to come along and watch. Organisers here have asked him to delay his appearance until later in the day because they were so worried about the hold-ups caused by his security. The admission conditions include rules against bringing in backpacks, banners and stools, but it is less clear what the policy is on a nuclear football.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump went to the US Open men’s singles final at Flushing Meadows in September and the match had to be delayed for an hour.Photograph: Manuel Balce Ceneta/APThe European team are so worried about what they are going to be up against thatthey have been using VR headsetsto condition themselves to all the heckling they are expecting. The first day of practice felt like trying to play 18 in the middle of a Maga rally.Trump got a mixed reception at Flushing Meadows, but US golf is further to the right than my slice and Bethpage is in Trump country. He won Nassau County by 4.2 percentage points in the 2024 election, a 14-point swing from 2020. In 2016, he chose the town for his homecoming rally before the New York primary. He told the crowd how he used to get up at 2am so he could get a tee-time here.View image in fullscreenPresident Trump arrives at the LIV Golf tournament in Doral, Florida, one of his courses. His attendance at Bethpage will lead to heightened security.Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesWhich, like everything else Trump claims in the game, may or may not be true. He also says he has a2.8 handicap and has won 36 club championships, including six in a single year, achievements that would mean a lot more if he ever registered his scores or played in tournaments at clubs he didn’t own against competitors he couldn’t boot out.It is one of thesport’s open secretsthat he is an inveterate cheat.Rick Reilly wrote a book about it. The only honest thing about Trump’s golf is how much he loves it. Pretty much every player here can tell you a story about how he has called them to talk through their latest victory in excruciating detail.He will be the first sitting president to attend the competition. George HW Bush went to Valhalla in 2008 and his son turned up at Brookline in 1999, when he was running for the presidency. The US captain, Ben Crenshaw, invited him in to address the team on the Saturday night when they were four-points down. Bush decided to read them William B Travis’s letter from the Alamo: “The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion, otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken – I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, & our flag still waves proudly from the walls.”View image in fullscreenGeorge W Bush (left) attended the Ryder Cup at Brookline in 1999 with his family and spoke to the US team on the Saturday night.Photograph: John Mottern/AFP/Getty ImagesBy the time Bush was done the team were so worked up that the next day they became the first team to come back from more than two points down before the singles to win the Cup. Along the way, one of the European player’s wives was spat at, the father of another left the course early because of the amount of abuse being thrown at his son and the US team ended up barnstorming the 17th green before José María Olazábal had the chance to make his last putt.On the BBC, Alistair Cooke said the day would “go down in infamy”. It was, everyone agreed afterwards,one of the most ignominious days in the history of the competition. It also, as Trump might point out, set a TV ratings record that stood for 13 years.Who knows what Bethpage is going to be like on Friday. The US captain, Keegan Bradley, suggested he was expecting Trump to set himself up by the first tee. “I’m just thrilled he’s going to be here. I really look forward to what that first tee is going to be like with the president on the tee. It’s going to be something everyone will remember for ever.” He is probably right about that, one way or the other.View image in fullscreenThe US’s huge comeback at Brookline in 1999 included many unsavoury aspects, notably after Justin Leonard holed his putt on 17.Photograph: Richard Sellers/SportsphotoScheffler, who you can only assume is too busy playing to listen to many of his president’s speeches, described Trump as “one of those guys when you’re around him, he does such a good job of feeding confidence into everybody around him. That was one of the things I noticed a lot with the little bit of time I spent with him, he treats everybody the same and treats people with the utmost respect.” Maybe Scottie does a fine line in irony, but my guess is he thinks it is the thing he packs in his bag next to the 3-wood.There is another irony here. Bethpage Black was built by Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Works Progress Administration, one of 250 municipal courses constructed as part of a drive to open up the game “to a new kind of average golfer” during the New Deal. Roosevelt was a golfer too, club champion, secretary and treasurer at Campobello in Maine. He designed a course especially for people recovering from polio at Warm Springs in Georgia; it has roads and reinforced bridges so patients could be driven in between holes. It is a very different idea of the game to the one we are going to see played out in the next few days.Explore more on these topicsRyder Cup 2025Ryder CupGolfUS sportsDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the deleted posts, seen by the Guardian, she said: “A lot of this has already happened and it can continue to happen outside the UK, whatever our laws say.”She added: “This might be a bitter pill to swallow for some.”TBI has received donations from the Oracle tech billionaire Larry Ellison, which reached $270m (£210m) last year. Oracle is a backer of the $600bn Stargate project to build AI infrastructure across the US with OpenAI and the Japanese investment firm SoftBank.Labour has been atloggerheads with the UK’s creative communitysince launching a consultation on reforming copyright law, with the preferred option of letting AI companies use copyright-protected work without seeking the owner’s permission – unless they signal a desire to opt out of the process.Some content creators including the Guardian and the Financial Times have signed deals with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, to licence and monetise their content for use in the San Francisco startup’s technology.The government has said requiring creatives to opt out is no longer its preferred option and it has convened working groups – drawn from the creative and AI sectors – to come up with solutions to the issue.Ed Newton-Rex, the founder of Fairly Trained, a non-profit that certifies generative AI companies that respect creators’ rights and a leading campaigner for creatives’ rights, said: “It is alarming that Liz Kendall will be getting advice from someone who seems so bought into big tech’s dreams of upending the UK’s copyright law.“I hope she will balance this out with advisers whose views more closely align with those of the general public – who are rightly anxious about the impacts of AI and the power of big tech.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This appointment, of someone who has said big AI firms will never have to pay creatives and has echoed big tech’s calls for copyright reform, suggests Liz Kendall may not take that opportunity.”Innes and Kendall declined to comment.Beeban Kidron, a cross-bench peer who has mobilised opposition to any relaxation of copyright law, said: “Last week the creatives sent a letter to the PM asking him to explain why the government was breaking human rights law, which clearly states a person’s right to copyright in their scientific and creative work. If his government’s policy is to undermine UK citizens human rights, that will be a particularly ironic outcome, for which the creative sector is unlikely to forgive him.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Liz KendallnewsShareReuse this content"

Under the legislation the commissioner can seek fines of up to $50m for non-compliance.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailIn its submission, X said less than 1% of the platform’s Australian users were under 16, and while the company agrees strategies for mitigating the risk of harm to children are fundamental, it had concerns about the social media ban.The company’s submission echoed similar concerns raised when the legislation was before the parliament.“We have serious concerns as to the lawfulness of the Social Media Minimum Age, including its compatibility with other regulations and laws, including international human rights treaties to which Australia is a signatory,” X said in its submission published on Wednesday.Australia’s under 16s social media ban could extend to Reddit, Twitch, Roblox and even dating appsRead more“We are especially concerned about the potential negative impact that the Social Media Minimum Age will have on the human rights of children and young people, including their rights to freedom of expression and access to information, principles which are enshrined in international treaties including the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and which must be protected.”Xpointed to commentsfrom the Australian Human Rights Commission in November expressing significant reservations about the legislation.X argued age assurance for users was a disproportionate response, and there was no evidence banning young people from social media would work to protect young people online or reduce harms without creating new ones.3:12YouTube included in Australia's social media ban for children, communications minister says – video“Not least amongst these concerns is the risk that when minors are barred from mainstream, regulated social media services, they will migrate to less moderated or entirely unregulated alternatives, thereby exposing them to greater potential harms including privacy breaches or unmoderated content,” X stated.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wayward son of the underworld Zagreus’s repeated attempts to abscond from his purgatorial prison offered catharsis at a time when none of us could leave our homes. It did no harm that it was genuinely, unapologetically sexy: all of artist Jen Zee’s character designs had abs hewn from Olympian rock, and just about everyone addressed you as if they’d seen you from across the bar and really dug your vibe. Winning the favour of these absurdly attractive Greek gods was the key to finally getting above ground. It was – apologies – a hell of an escape.And a hell of an act to follow, too. But in Hades II, composer Darren Korb delivers a thunderously dramatic score for the closing stages of your Olympian ascent that reaches alevel of operatic grandeurto trump anything in the original game. Zee’s new character illustrations (including onereturning favouritein a leopardskin posing pouch) are, if anything, likely to inspire even more aggressively thirsty fanart and fanfic. And writer Greg Kasavin’s wonderful script is wittier, wiser and flirtier than ever.Zagreus has absconded for the sequel: this time you’re his sister Melinoë, who finds herself at a crossroads.Not the motel, but the woodland clearing she calls home, alongside a clutch of spectral Shades and mentor Hecate. It might be gloomy and damp, but unlike Zag, she’s not looking to get away: she ventures out to fight each night because the Titan of Time, Chronos, is up to no good. Yes, in a wry subversion of what we were all doing five years ago, Supergiant is now literally inviting us to kill Time. It’s a battle on two fronts, and at two extremes: deep beneath the surface, and at the peak of Mount Olympus.View image in fullscreenToil and trouble … Hades II.Photograph: Supergiant GamesYou probably won’t even beat Hecate on your first attempt – a fight against your “headmistress” is only the first test of your combat skills. But therein lies the appeal of run-based games such as Hades II. Each night represents a chance to improve, to hone your (witch)craft. There are lessons to be learned in failure, but on each run you’ll makesomemeasure of progress. It leans fully into its occult theme: you’ll forage ingredients to drop into the cauldron between runs, and your spells and incantations improve your chances of survival.It draws inspiration, too, fromanother pandemic favourite. Animals crossing your path can sniff out resourcesandhelp in battle. Pale raven Raki pecks at rocks and foes alike, while faithful hound Hecuba can leave opponents stunned while digging up restorative snacks. I personally found it hard to look beyond wildcat Toula, who lunges, claws bared, at nearby opponents – when she can be bothered, at least. She also allows you to defy death once per run; with nine lives, she can afford to spare one.You’ll need the help of these unfamiliar familiars, and every bit of godly assistance besides, to conquer Chronos. Encounters are every bit as intense as you’d hope for, and it takes a minute to adjust to Melinoë’s enchanted arsenal. Fittingly, even as you wield her witch’s staff like a spear, combat feels closer to sorcery. A black coat that allows you to punch opponents into the ether doubles as a magic jetpack. The umbral flames have become my go-to, usually powered up by blacksmithHephaestus. As difficult as Hades II gets, you have more ways than ever to weight the dice in your favour. Conversely, you can make Olympus’s slopes even steeper: nightmarish boss-fight variants, for instance, demand mastery of the game’s most deliciously evil risk-reward mechanic.One of the joys of Hades II is getting caught up in the internecine discord amongthe dysfunctional extended family. But it’s ultimately aboutresolvingconflict. Sure, not everyone has read the memo: Scylla, front woman of a pop-punk trio of Sirens, cheerfully sings aboutclawing out your eyes and drowning youin the dank depths ofOceanus. But even the likes of power-suited Chaos and grumpy Nemesis (so affronted by you effectively doing her job that she’ll sporadically show up to challenge you to a contest, before barricading a potential exit) can be won over with a gift of nectar – or ambrosia. The game’s ending, too, makes it abundantly clear that any fight against forces of oppression requires us all to play a part, no matter how small; that whether you go low or high, resistance requires strength that can only come from solidarity.Explore more on these topicsGamesAdventure gamesAction gamesPCNintendo SwitchNintendo Switch 2reviewsShareReuse this content"

It started out as essentially a house party: a gathering of 27 people in the living room of Atari designer Chris Crawford. By the mid-90s it had left Chris’s house and grown to more than 4,000 attenders, and in 2005 found a permanent home in San Francisco’s Moscone Center. These days, about 30,000 game development professionals of all kinds attend every year. The online GDC Vaultis a precious troveof game development history and useful advice for any gaming discipline.GDC has developed a bit of an image problem in recent years, however, as we havereportedbefore. It’s prohibitively expensive for developers: a conference pass is more than $1,500, and travel and accommodation in one of the world’s most expensive cities quickly multiplies the total cost to anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000 (even for a hotel room with approximately the dimensions and safety of a phone booth).On top of that, since Trump was re-elected president, a large percentage of the global video game development community is reluctant to visit the US. And the vibe of the event has been somewhat soured by the sudden withdrawal of funding from the entire games industry, alongside the threats to developers’ livelihoods from AI and ever-present layoffs. If nobody is funding games, what’s the point of travelling for days and spending thousands to attend some meetings?As Jon Ingold, founder of UK studio Inkle, puts it: “GDC as an industry brokerage doesn’t make sense when there’s no money, no hiring, and the US is a hostile place to be … I fear whatever they do instead is too little too late; the executive club don’t leave much behind when they move out.”Perhaps this is why the event has decided to rebrand. On Monday night it was announced that Game Developers Conference is now GDC: Festival of Gaming. Avision presentationpromises “a full week of opportunity” in “a space where the full B2B games ecosystem connects”. It is quite hard to discern from this presentation what will actually be changing, but the key takeaways seem to be that getting a pass will be simpler, and events will now be all over the city rather than just at its Moscone conference centre.View image in fullscreenCalifornia calling … inside the GDC: Festival of Gaming.Unfortunately this rebrand does not address the concerns that developers have been expressing for years: namely, that access isn’t good enough, and that San Francisco (and perhaps, at this point, the US more broadly) is a terrible place for a global games conference. “Despite clear Covid-era evidence that GDC could be digitally accessible, and there being no reason but [organiser] Informa’s bottom line for the event being so expensive, GDC remains offline-only and the ticket prices obscene,” says independent game developer and consultant Rami Ismail, who has long been vocal about GDC’s problems on behalf of the global developer community. “Many developers around the world spend thousands to have their visas rejected after months or even years of wait. Even if they get the visa, the US has never been a safe place to visit, in terms of weapons, crime and health costs. [And] the Trump administrations’ institution of alt-right populism has made it unacceptably dangerous to even enter the country for most.”This statement is not overblown. Stories about visitors to the US being refused entry to the country anddeportedor – much worse – detained by Ice have been everywhere since Trump’s re-election. People aretravelling with burner phonesand scrubbing their social media. Anecdotally, many European developers and journalists, myself included, are reluctant to travel to the US under the current administration. For people coming from Arabic or South American countries, the concerns are significantly greater.I think most of the global game development workforce would agree that the US doesn’t make sense as a hub for the industry any more. San Francisco used to be one of the world’s centres of game development, and it still is home to some top-class companies and studios, but I can’t be the only one who feels that the city has been hollowed out by Silicon Valley types and no longer has the creative atmosphere that it did.There’s an easy alternative: Canada’s generous tax breaks have made it a very attractive place to develop games, and its current government is not actively hostile to foreigners. Local game developer gatherings exist in most countries, from Brighton’s Develop in the UK toGamesConnect in Australia. Gamescom now takes place in Cologne, Singapore and Brazil, with growing developer events alongside the public-facing ones. There’s nothing that the GDC organisers can do about the Trump administration, but if it wants to retain its position as a professional gaming nexus, it’s going to take more than a rebrand to make the case.What to playUncomfortably funny … Consume Me.Photograph: Jenny Jiao HsiaVideo game season is ramping up and there’s plenty to choose from: Supergiant’s painfully stylish mythological action game Hades II is just out of early access, and it’s excellent. Horror reboot Silent Hill f is also delighting (most) critics.I am playingConsume Me,developer Jenny Jiao Hsia’s uncomfortably funny game about surviving high school at the height of 2000s diet culture. As you go about Jenny’s relatable teenage life – involving absurd mini-games about trying to concentrate in class and walking the dog – you’re also having painfully awkward conversations with your parents about your weight, trying to Tetris foodstuffs on to your plate and waking up with food anxiety.This will be an uncomfortable topic for many people; it brings back depressing memories about the disturbing female body standards of the 2000s, and it may feel difficult to enjoy if you’ve ever struggled with disordered eating (or known someone who has). But these things are handled with humour, compassion and enough satirical bite (sorry) to make the discomfort worthwhile.Available on:PCEstimated playtime:five hoursskip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For some reason, hisoriginal 2020 storyabout this remains one of our most-read articles ever, and has prompted a group of scientists to start investigating. Well, those researchersfinally have an answer: it’s to do with how your brain perceives 3D space.Question BlockWords of wisdom … The Legend of Zelda.Photograph: NintendoOn the back of last week’s issue about video game dialogue-worms, readerWilliamasks:“I feel like there are quotes from various video games that can act as words to live by. Two of my favourites include: “Don’t hesitate; when the time comes, just act” (Wolf O’Donnell, Star Fox Assault) and “A stubborn enough person can survive just about anything; rage is a hell of an anaesthetic” (Zaeed Massani, Mass Effect 2).Which video game words of wisdomhave struck a chord with you?”This is perhaps an unpopular opinion, but I believe that video games are usually profound by accident. Many of the stickiest quotes from games arise from some quirk of translation or voice acting (“I used to be an adventurer … but then I took an arrow to the knee”, “All your base are belong to us”, “Jill, the master of unlocking”). They’re often memorable for their absurdity rather than their deep meaning.That said, the phrase “It’s dangerous to go alone – take this” from the original Legend of Zelda has somehow made its way into my avoidant heart as genuine words of warmth, and “The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world” from Half-Life 2 has stuck with me.This is a good one to open up to the readership: do you have a video game quote that actually means something to you?If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter, including your favourite game quotes – hit reply or email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yet progress on clean energy shows what’s possible. With political will, cooperation can still avert the worst of the climate crisisWed 24 Sep 2025 16.17 EDTFirst published on Wed 24 Sep 2025 13.20 EDTShareAll is not lost, Simon Stiell, the UN’s climate chief, told the Guardian last week. But the latestplanetary health checkfrom the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research is a brutal reminder of how close the Earth is being pushed beyond repair. Seven of the nine planetary boundaries are now breached, with ocean acidification added to the danger list. Yet the world has proved that cooperation works: the ozone layer is healing, air pollution controls are working. A decisive test looms at the end of the month, when governments must file new climate pledges, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs). This is no time to ease off: the fossil-fuel era must end, and the clean‑energy transition must accelerate.There is real concern that big emitters,including Australiaand the EU, will fall short of what is needed to avoid extreme heating. The EU is set to miss this month’s NDC deadline, while mostfossil-fuel producersplan to cut emissions at the margins instead of phasing out production. Since Donald Trump has withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement, the US will make no fresh commitments at all. At the UN, Mr Trumptrottedout the same stale oil-industry talking points he’s been peddling for years.But there are also encouraging signs, including the fact that global investment in renewables keeps rising. In the first half of 2025 it reacheda record $386bn, 10% higherthan the same period last year. China alone installed more than 250GW of solar power capacity in this brief period –more than twice as muchas the rest of the world combined. However,China’s new NDC targets just 7% to 10% cuts in emissions by 2035– not enough to hit Paris’ goals. It’s the right direction but the wrong speed.Global investment in clean energy, including nuclear and grid upgrades, is also up, and expected to reach around $2.2tn in 2025 – roughly twice the amount being spent on fossil fuels. Since inadequate grids have been an obstacle to the expansion of clean power in many countries,including the UK, this too is good news. However, the rise of anti-climate populists in European states includingGermanyis deeply concerning, and perhaps explains theEU’s increased caution. A “statement of intent” by the bloc last week indicated that it expects to commit to emissions cuts of up to 72.5% by 2035 (compared with 1990 levels), which falls short of the 79% or more that campaigners have pushed for.Responsible politicians everywhere must proactively address voters’ concerns about the impact of green policies on their lives, and keep reminding them how much more costly and dangerous the alternatives to a green transition are. In the US, too, climate policies are progressing – despite the Trump administration’s opposition.About 19 states, and corporations covering two-thirds of US corporate revenues, still back net zero.Renewables growth is essential, but unless carbon emissions are reduced at the same time, net zero is impossible. If planned fossil-fuel projects proceed, global output in 2030 will be more than double the limit for keeping heating to 1.5C. Mr Stiell is right to point to progress as well as threat. The crisis won’t be solved at thisCopor the next. But abandoning the process would mean abandoning hope – and handing victory to the wreckers.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Unfortunately, when that man is the US president, his opinion cannot be ignored.Earlier this year, Donald Trump asserted that Vladimir Putin had “all the cards” and urged Volodymyr Zelenskyy to make peace in terms that resembled surrender. This week,Mr Trump declaredthat Kyiv might achieve total victory, liberating all territory currently under Russian occupation.This assessment follows a process described by the president as “getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia military and economic situation”. Mr Trump offered to continue supplying American weapons for Nato “to do what they want with them”. Asked about Russian incursions into airspace over alliance members, the president suggested the offending jets could be shot down. This was later qualified as a prescription to be followed only “if they’re attacking”.Given Mr Trump’s capacity for hyperbole, self‑contradiction and spouting nonsense, it is hard to evaluate the significance of his sudden enthusiasm for Ukrainian liberation and gung-ho attitude to Moscow’s military provocations.It is not wholly new. His attitude to Mr Zelenskyy has evolved quite gradually, and with assiduous encouragement from European leaders, fromcontempttocourtesyand now something like respect. With Mr Putin he has veered fromcredulous admirationto wary patience to tetchy frustration and back again. He hasset deadlinesfor the Kremlin to stop the killing or face more robust sanctions, and failed to follow through. Asked this week whether he still trusted the Russian president, Mr Trump said he would know in a month’s time.Judging by recent precedent, that leaves ample scope for yet another shift in position; another round of craven indulgence for Kremlin narratives about the war.Such inveterate unreliability makes it hard to divine motive in the White House. Sincere interest in protecting democracy against authoritarian attack and strategic investment in the security of the US’s historical allies are, sadly, not plausible explanations. They wouldn’t be consistent with Mr Trump’songoing assaulton the US’s own constitutional order, or with his well-attested tendency to see everything through the lens of ego and self-aggrandisement.In that context, the likelier reason is ongoing determination to earn plaudits as a great peacemaker, coupled with belated realisation that Mr Putin will not end a war that he still believes he can win. Having tried to bully Ukraine into capitulation, Mr Trump may now be attempting something more like deterrence – ramping up the cost of the war for the Kremlin to see if that moves the dial towards a ceasefire.If so, it is certainly a better plan than appeasement, which only encouraged further aggression. Mr Trump’s assessment of the balance of strength on the battlefield is more optimistic on Ukraine’s behalf than most independent analysis, but it would also become self-fulfilling if followed up with sufficient military aid. The same applies to his gloomy prognosis forRussia’s economyif tougher sanctions are expedited.If Mr Trump is indeed converted to the cause of maximising pressure on the Kremlin as a means to end the war, it is a transformation that Kyiv’s more stalwart allies should welcome but cannot rely upon. It presents a strategic opportunity to be seized and maximised on the understanding that it may not last.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Brendan Carr, the Federal Communications Commission chairperson, pressured the Disney company toindefinitely suspendJimmy Kimmel, the late-night talkshow host on ABC, for a remark he made about the right wing’s attempts to shape perceptions about the murderer of the far-right political operative Charlie Kirk. (Kimmel is now back on the air.) It was the opening riff of Carr’s stand-up routine.Carr’s choice of venue to issue his threat – a hard-right podcast – indicated the kind of media of which he approves. His pressure against Kimmel is no isolated gesture, but the execution of a calculated plan he himself helped hatch to eradicate critical political speech. But Carr’s exploitation of the death of Charlie Kirk to serve as the trigger for Trump’s repression only succeeded in turningJimmy Kimmelinto a free speech symbol before his return to television on Tuesday.“Free speech is the counterweight – it is the check on government control,” Carrwroteas an FCC commissioner in 2023. “That is why censorship is the authoritarian’s dream.” Then, on 17 September, hetold the podcast: “We can do this the easy way or the hard way.Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert … who is the next to be silenced? | Moira DoneganRead more“These companies can find ways to change conduct to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”Now, Carr was fulfilling “the authoritarian’s dream”. He seems indifferent to his duplicity, boldly tossing aside pretense. Dealing with Kimmel, he posed as a stereotypical gangster speaking in clichés from a 1930s movie: “the easy way or the hard way.” Carr seems excited by his own rough language. His display of brass knuckles, however, demolishes his legitimacy to wear a badge. As the violator of free speech, he betrays his office as a protector. He also destroys conservative posturing as the special victim of speech suppression.Carr is using government power to eliminate criticism. He is implementing a policy of censorship he himself authored in the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 playbook. Even when he imitates a mobster, he does not issue his threats in a raised voice. His tone does not rise to the histrionics ofStephen Miller. Carr is a zealot of a certain type, the rightwing Leninist with the grim resolve of a commissar, the bureaucrat rigorously checking off boxes – in this case, purging late-night comedians – to fulfill the larger ideological agenda.The operation of Trump’s purge involves not the slightest bit of persuasion, debate or discussion. Carr is executing the will of the leader who is not to be questioned and above all never to be ridiculed. “We’re not done yet” with the changes in “the media ecosystem”,Carr told CNBCon 18 September. He called the erasure of Kimmel a “market correction”. Carr is incapable of comprehending when he is unintentionally funny in a way that is self-undermining. He’s not only Trump’s executioner. He’s Trump’s straight man.Before the identity, let alone the motive, of the Kirk assassin was known, Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff,raged against“an ideology at war with family and nature”. Weeks before, on Fox News, he had alreadydeclaredthe Democratic party “a domestic extremist organization”. Now, after Kirk’s assassination, taking Miller’s cue, the rightwing sitethe Federaliststated: “After a long history of condoning, advocating, and participating in political violence, it is time to designate the Democrat party adomestic terrorist organization.”Carr is a zealot of a certain type, the rightwing Leninist with the grim resolve of a commissar, the bureaucrat rigorously checking off boxes ... to fulfill the larger ideological agendaThe influential anti-woke activist Christopher Rufotweeted: “The last time the radical Left orchestrated a wave of violence and terror, J Edgar Hoover shut it all down within a few years. It is time, within the confines of the law, to infiltrate, disrupt, arrest, and incarcerate all of those who are responsible for this chaos.”JD Vancethreatened: “We are working very hard to ensure that the funding networks for leftwing violence, that the radicalization networks for leftwing violence – that if you encourage or fund your fellow Americans or anybody else to commit acts of violence because you disagree with political speech, you are going to be treated like a terrorist organization and we are going to go after you.”Trump went on Fox & Friendsto point his finger: “The radicals on the left are the problem – and they are vicious and horrible and politically savvy.”All of this occurred before Jimmy Kimmel’s ouster.Meanwhile, gaggles of feverish far-right influencers, whose stock-in-trade is conspiracy theories, tried to debunk one fantasy spinning around the internet that threatened to boomerang on them. Within the Maga hothouse, Kirk had faced backlash in 2019 from the Groypers, led by Nick Fuentes, who once dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, and accused Kirk of being too moderate. Kirk latershiftedhis position to the hard right on immigration. “I’ve noticed people like Charlie Kirk … are now calling for an immigration moratorium,” Fuentessaidin June. “That means they want to shut down all immigration. And suffice to say, the Groypers have won. It’s just not even a question at this point.”The theory spread like wildfire that the killer’s cryptic inscriptions on shell casings could beGroyper messages. If they were, he would be an errant rightwing extremist, not a leftwing one. Those etched messages, however, apparently referred to a range of things, including gaming memes. No evidence has emerged that Tyler Robinson, the suspect, had political connections to any group or the involvement of anyone else in his act.But with the far-right’s history of heated factional warfare flaring in the background, Jimmy Kimmel said in his monologue on 15 September : “The Maga gang [is] desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”Yanking Jimmy Kimmel’s show is a new low for free speech in America | Margaret SullivanRead moreKimmel’s comment condensed, into a line that was not a joke, a complicated and fraught situation, down the rabbit hole of the far right, involving the frenzied Maga effort to pin the blame on the “radical left” and by extension the whole Democratic party, and to deflect scrutiny of their own infighting. Kimmel’s remark assumed a lot of arcane knowledge on the part of his audience.At the same time, the FCC, which Carr chairs, wasconsidering a $6.2bn mergerbetween Nexstar Media, a large owner of TV stations, and the Tegna media company.Within days of Kimmel’s rather innocuous comment,Carr statedthat the comedian was “appearing to directly mislead the American public”. Nexstar announced it would no longer broadcast Jimmy Kimmel’s show. Disney followed by suspending him from ABC. Carr praised Nexstar “for doing the right thing”.Ironically, during the Red Scare, in 1950, when Gypsy Rose Lee, soon to be the host of an ABC radio gameshow called What Makes You Tick?, wasaccusedof being a Communist by the American Legion and Red Channels, a conservative publication seeking to root out subversives in the media, ABC executives stood by her. CBS, on the other hand, demanded all of its employeessign a loyalty oath. Gypsy Rose Lee said about the efforts at censorship: “This may be all right for Russia, but I hope not for us.”Sinclair, a rightwing-controlled media outlet that broadcasts ABC shows,announcedthat suspension of Kimmel was insufficient and that it would pre-empt his program until further notice. But even that was not enough. Sinclair demanded that Kimmel “make a meaningful personal donation to the Kirk Family and Turning Point USA”. Instead of airing the show, Sinclair said, it would offer to its affiliates a “remembrance” of Kirk, “who boldly and tirelessly defended biblical values and truth as he challenged a new generation to stand firm for Christ”. The piece was sanitized of hisracist, nativist,antisemiticand misogynistviews, and hisassertionthat Joe Biden “should honestly be put in prison and/or be given the death penalty for his crimes against America”. Kirk, extolled as an exemplar of free speech and debate, had in fact created a “Professor Watchlist” to blacklist liberal academics across the board. Sinclair made Kirk, touted as an advocate of free speech, into a symbol of its suppression. But, after further stoking the firestorm, Sinclair put its “remembrance” on YouTube and instead ran an episode of Celebrity Family Feud. Once Disney restored Kimmel’s show, Sinclair and Nexstar stated their affiliates would not air it.Carr launched his attack on Kimmel on a podcast called The Benny Show, hosted by Benny Johnson, the former chief creative officer at Kirk’sTurning Point USA. Carr had plunged down a deep rabbit hole of the right with a dubious character.Johnson was fired fromBuzzFeedin 2014 after being accused of plagiarism. He was later associated with a political consulting firm called Arsenal Media – “a chaotic working environment, rife with internal bullying, toxic HR practices, and an intense culture of secrecy”, where some contractors said they were not paid, according to an investigative report inthe Verge. (Johnson’s own website described him as a co-founder and chief creative officer of the site until April 2022, according to the report, but a spokesperson for Johnson told the Verge in April 2022 that he “is not currently, nor has ever been an owner, executive, or even employee of Arsenal Media”.) Johnson was also exposed last year to be among a group of six rightwing influencers who werefunneled $10m from two Russian agentsindicted by the justice department. Johnson and the others claimed to have been duped.When Pam Bondi, the attorney general, created an uproar, including on the right, by stating: “We will absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech,” Jonathan Karl, the former ABC White House correspondent, asked Trump his reaction.“She’ll probably go after people like you, because you treat me so unfairly,” Trumprepliedto Karl. “You have a lot of hate in your heart. Maybe they will come after ABC. ABC paid me $16m recently for a form of hate speech. Your company paid me $16m for a form of hate speech, so maybe they will have to go after you.” Trump was referring to hissuitagainst ABC for This Week anchor George Stephanopoulos’s comment coming out of the E Jean Carroll trial describing Trump’s sexual violence. It was generally believed that ABC would have won the case, but the prospective threat to the Disney company from the Trump administration prompted its first capitulation.Trump, on his state visit to Britain,slammed Kimmelat a press conference with Keir Starmer, saying the host had been “fired because he had bad ratings” and was “not a talented person”. The old reality-TV host’s jealousy for an actual show-business star shone through. In fact, Kimmel’s show was ratedNo 1with the highly valued young adult demographic.On Air Force One, Trump suggested that the FCC look intorevoking the licensesof other networks, saying: “They give me only bad publicity or press. I mean, they’re getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away.”If there are further attempts at impertinent humor, they will be met with even more severe punishments. Will Carr issue a full report to meet the crisis, perhaps to a newly created House committee on the weaponization of humor, the Trump era version of the Red Scare’s House un-American activities committee? Will witnesses be subpoenaed from the writers’ room? Will comics be permitted to sign confessions regretting their past gags? What about the audience members, fellow travelers all, who laughed? An inquisition of comedy would take everyone’s minds off the Epstein files. Are you now or have you ever been a comedian? No joking! That’s an order – an executive order.Sidney Blumenthal is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsJimmy KimmelOpinionTrump administrationUS televisionTelevisionUS politicsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Doubtless, some will have persuaded themselves that the real Trump was the onewe saw in Windsora week ago, fawning over the royals, treating Keir Starmer with respect, and claiming that Britain and the United States were two notes in the same chord. Well, maybe.Perhaps the more plausible version was actually the one whowent to the United Nationsthis week. This Trump went not to fawn but to boast and trash, whingeing about everything from the UN’s supposed failure to back his claims to have ended seven “un-endable” wars, to its refusal to award him a renovation building contract – “I said at the time that I would do it for $500m, rebuilding everything, it would be beautiful” – for its New York headquarters complex.Which one is the real Trump? There is probably no single version of the US president’s huge personality that makes complete sense of all the competing others. To be fair, Trump is not alone in this. Centuries ago, Michel de Montaigne wrote that none of us is ever one person alone; “every sort of contradiction can be found in me,” the French sage concluded. Never a truer word was written, especially as far as Trump is concerned.Another clue that may help unlock the puzzle is that Trump’s explosive mix of often contradictory qualities seems increasingly to resemble that of Otto von Bismarck. The founder of modern Germany is many people’s idea of a master politician – not something that many – except maybe Trump himself – would say about the president yet.Like Trump, however, Bismarck had the ability both to charm and brutalise, to calculate and to rage, to dominate the room, to never forgive his critics – and to lie shamelessly in pursuit of his goals. Bismarck was far more consequential in his career than Trump has yet been in his, but there are some disturbing parallels already, not least in the fateful instability of what Bismarck eventually left behind.It would be a mistake to read too much too soon into Trump’s unexpectedcomments about Ukraineon Tuesday. What he said was, all the same, a very striking U-turn for a man who thought his Alaska summit with Vladimir Putin could unlock a peace deal. Now, he has switched to backing the shooting down of Russian planes violating European airspace; dismissing Russia as a paper tiger not a real military power; and claiming that Ukraine could win back all of its lost territory since 2022. “Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act,” Trump posted later.Trump also promised “to supply weapons to Nato for Nato to do what they want with them”. That would also be very big, if true; the issue has bedevilled Nato’s negotiations with Washington for months. If Volodymyr Zelenskyy is also right that Trump is offering US postwar military guarantees to Ukraine, then this looks like something more substantial than mere hardening of the president’s language against Russia.There is a case for asking whetherthe UN speechmay have been something of a smokescreen, designed mainly for an isolationist US domestic audience. Meanwhile, off-camera, some potentially significant stuff was actually going on nearby over Gaza and Ukraine. Trump’s New York meetings with Zelenskyy and with Arab and Muslim world leaders suggest as much.Yet it would be foolish to dismiss the UN speech as a mere diversionary exercise or tactical ploy. It was more substantive and significant than that. Yes, there were the familiar lies and false claims on everything from the un-endable wars, through Sadiq Khan’s wish to introduce sharia law to London, to Trump’s own poll numbers. “The highest … I’ve ever had,” he asserted; in fact, his approval ratings are ata second-term low.And, yes, the narcissism and the language were at times outrageous. “I’m really good at this stuff. Your countries are going to hell,” he told nations that are supposedly still the US’s loyal allies – before denouncing “the green energy scam” and adding: “Trump was right about everything, and I don’t say that in a braggadocious way, but it’s true. I’ve been right about everything.” At 57 minutes, not the expected 15, it was a hard speech to listen to.Yet there was content in it too. There was also a clear argument. The White House had billed the speech as an exposition of how US power would be deployed on the world stage. The first part of the answer was predictable: not through the United Nations. So, as the tariff wars have shown, was the second: its power would be exercised unilaterally by a sovereign independent US. As theWhite House news releasesuccinctly put it: “At UN, President Trump champions sovereignty, rejects globalism.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Starmer’s invitation was a big mistake | Frances RyanRead moreTrump asked at one stage what the UN’s purpose was. His real quarrel, though, is with the international rules-based order itself, of which the UN forms merely one part. This stretches beyond the wider postwar settlement that the US shaped in the 1940s. In fact, as the speech made increasingly clear, Trump is more opposed to recent global regulatory accords and international law than he is to the post-1945 institutions that the US can dominate. This is why he hates the climate accords, and why he will always dislike the EU. It is also why he wants to export his ideas to Europe and Britain, and thus weaken the rules-based order’s principal champions.For Trump, the speech’s key issues are to end the threat to sovereign nations, as he sees it, from migration and the green agenda. These are not passing fancies. They are his enduring priorities, and they will remain so. This is likely to have continuing repercussions in the domestic politics of Europe, and perhaps, because the two countries insist so much on their special relationship, in British politics most of all. In the end, that’s why this speech matters.Nothing else can explain why Trump used the UN speech to attack Britain so insistently. Britain got it in the neck more than China, than Russia, than Venezuela or than North Korea. Trump attacked Britain relentlessly, sometimes seemingly more in sorrow than in anger, over migration, over international law, renewable energy, North Sea oil and on the recognition of Palestine. Less than a week after Trump’s state visit, the transatlantic chord sounds more dissonant now. It was as if Trump has looked at the world and at last found an unexpected adversary – us.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But Trump delivered a long and humiliating rant, filled with personal grievances andattacks on the UN, European leaders, migration policies and clean energy.Trump set a low bar with his often rambling and incoherentcampaign speeches, but it was still an embarrassing performance for the US president on the global stage. In his past appearances before the general assembly, Trump generally stuck to his prepared remarks and did not hector US allies sitting in the audience. But this was Trump unfiltered and unleashed – as he has been since the start of his second term, with no domestic or international restraint on his power and no need for even the mildest diplomatic niceties.Early in his speech, Trump complained that his teleprompter had malfunctioned and that a UN escalator had stalled when he and the first lady, Melania Trump, stepped on it on Tuesday morning. “These are the two things I got from the United Nations: a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter,” Trump joked, drawing laughs from the audience. But it quickly became clear that Trump was nursing a decades-old grudge against the UN: In the early 2000s, he had been denied anopportunity to rebuildthe organization’s New York headquarters.“Many years ago, a very successful real estate developer in New York, known as Donald J Trump, I bid on the renovation and rebuilding of this very United Nations complex,”Trump toldhis fellow world leaders – in a digression that would have been ridiculed if any other leader had done it. “I remember it so well. I said at the time that I would do it for $500m, rebuilding everything. It would be beautiful.” Trump went on to muse that he had promised UN officials marble floors and mahogany walls, while other contractors would ultimately deliver terrazzo and plastic, as part of amassive renovationthat ended up costing over $2bn.Even at the height of his power, Trump can’t resist being an insecure businessman who whines about losing a construction contract more than 20 years ago.And that wasn’t the most cringeworthy part of Trump’s performance at the UN. He went on several lengthy tirades against immigration, calling on European countries to emulate US policies and close their borders and expel migrants. He accused the UN of leading a “globalist migration agenda”, and told western leaders that the organization was “funding an assault on your countries”. As he lectured other leaders about how they’re failing, Trump bragged about his own immigration crackdown and foresight as a populist demagogue. “It’s time to end the failed experiment of open borders. You have to end it now … I’m really good at this stuff,”he said, adding nonchalantly: “Your countries are going to hell.”As part of his attack on migration, Trump also insulted Sadiq Khan, who was elected London’s mayor in 2016 and became the first Muslim leader of a western capital. “I look at London, where you have a terrible mayor, terrible, terrible mayor, and it’s been changed, it’s been so changed. Now they want to go to sharia law,”Trump said, falsely claiming that Khan wants to place the British capital under Islamic religious law.While Trump’s insult seemed ad-libbed, it’s another example of the president using his platform to settle petty political scores. Trump has held a grudge against Khan since late 2015, when Khan (then a member of parliament and candidate for mayor) called Trump’s campaign pledgeto ban Muslims from enteringthe US “divisive and outrageous”. The feud between the two politicians has continued for years. In an article for the Guardian published last week, shortly before Trump’s state visit to the UK,Khan wrotethe US president has “perhaps done the most to fan the flames of divisive, far-right politics around the world.”As he flew back to the US,Trump saidKhan was “among the worst mayors in the world”, and claimed that he had asked UK officials not to invite Khan to a state dinner hosted by King Charles in the president’s honor.Unfortunately, the long list of grievances Trump laid out in his UN speech was not limited to politicians and global institutions that he believed had wronged him. Trump spent about a quarter of his speech undermining UN-led efforts to address climate change and ridiculing renewable energy policies. He denied the scientific consensus that humans, through the burning of fossil fuels, are causing global warming,calling it“the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”. Trump added that warnings of severe floods, widespread droughts, extreme heat waves and other climate-related disasters “were made by stupid people”.Trump also celebratedhis decision to withdrawthe US from the Paris climate agreement, which committed nearly all countries in the world to reducing greenhouse emissions and limiting global warming below levels that could lead to catastrophe. He denounced renewable energy sources like solar power and wind farms as a “joke” and praised “clean, beautiful coal”.By the conclusion of his meandering and unhinged speech, Trump tried to advance a dark narrative: that immigration, along with reliance on clean energy sources, posed an existential threat to western nations. “Immigration and the high cost of so-called green, renewable energy is destroying a large part of the free world and a large part of our planet,”Trump said, warning his fellow leaders that, if they don’t emulate his policies restricting migration and expanding the use of fossil fuels, it would “be the death of western Europe”.In the end, Trump wanted what he always craves: attention and adoration – even if he has to unleash fear and chaos to get it.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor, at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicsUnited NationscommentShareReuse this content"

While estimates for next year vary, it is possible that industry will invest a comparable amount. This suggests that the industry is receiving more capital than has been invested in the rest of the tech industry since the modern era began in 1956, the year the justice department’s consent decree with AT&T gave birth to Silicon Valley.In a technology investing career that now spans 43 years, I have never seen a phenomenon remotely like large language model AI. Big tech, journalists, politicians,CEOsand investors are all convinced that AI is an inevitable Next Big Thing thatwill change everythingin our economy and society for the better.AI will make the rich unfathomably richer. Is this really what we want? | Dustin GuastellaRead moreMuch has been written about LLMs, includingbooksthatchallengethe promises of the industry,in at least one casesuggesting LLMs are a confidence game. One issue that remains unaddressed is that even if the technology delivers on its promise, many, if not most of the current players are bound to fail. The knock-on effects of these failures may be catastrophic, especially for equity investors.Depending on how you count, there are either five or six essentially identical LLM development programs in AI from big tech players in the US:Google,Amazon,Meta, xAi, andMicrosoft/OpenAI, who may be either allies or competitors. This does not includeNvidia, which supplies semiconductors and software to the industry,Apple, which has a large program for internal use, Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI team members, and many others. Each one of the five or six big tech programs appears to be seeking a global monopoly, the cost of which will be measured in hundreds of billions of dollars.Investment in AI in by corporate customers in 2022 was$91.9bn, which does not include investments from industry, investors and other sources.Gartner group estimatesthat total investment in LLMs, related infrastructure and other AI services will be $1.48tn, up nearly 50% on 2024. Even though that number includes investments that are AI-adjacent, the level of investment in AI is without precedent.The huge gap between capital investment in infrastructure and end user license revenue from AI software is not sustainableAccording toEpoch.ai, total sales of LLM products to the public by market leaders OpenAI, Google and Anthropic were about $1bn in 2023, growing to about $4bn in 2024. Revenue from all sources this year may be between$235bnand$244bn, but the vast majority of that will go to the infrastructure required to train and operate LLMs. Almost every forecast anticipates continued high revenue growth for many years, reaching$1tn by 2031. At least oneforecasteris predicting global revenues in excess of $3tn by 2033. But to achieve those figures, investment will have to remain gargantuan.The huge gap between capital investment in infrastructure and end user license revenue from AI software is not sustainable. Every participant is confident that the gap will close with a huge increase in end user revenue, but they may be wrong. In the meantime, investors take comfort in the fact that one company’s investment is another company’s revenue. For example, cloud services revenue atMicrosoft, Google and Amazon has exploded during the industry’s investment phase. A similar thing has happened with semiconductor sales at Nvidia. Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia have made large investments in startups, providing capital that then comes back to them as revenue.All of this investment has not yielded equivalent success for customers. Media has reported failures with AI in thelaw,education,wellness,software developmentand other categories that range between disappointing and catastrophic. The industry promises that it will fix the problems with AI, and perhaps it will. But that is a big bet, and not the only one investors and customers are making today.Investors have assumed that every major US player in LLMs will be a winner. This assumption is essential, as the monopolies that power big tech – such as Microsoft’s Office suite,GoogleSearch, Gmail, and Docs, and Meta’s Facebook – are, without exception, approaching the end of their useful lives. The vast majority of customers believe that these products have gotten worse – and made users less productive – over the past decade or more. Each big tech company needs a global monopoly in AI to sustain their success and market value. They are not all going to get one.Tech companies are stealing our books, music and films for AI. It’s brazen theft and must be stopped | Anna Funder and Julia PowlesRead moreThe former General Electric CEO Jack Welch made famous the notion that only two players can be profitable in a competitive industry. Below the top two, it is a struggle to survive. That means that at least three, and perhaps more, of the current players will be forced to write off their investments in LLMs. Each of the big tech companies has invested in the range of$100bn through this year, and by next year that number could easily double. If LLM technology does not improve rapidly, their corporate customers will also face write-offs.Who is best positioned to succeed? The team of Microsoft and OpenAI have the best marketing, but their internal squabbles may pull them apart. xAi built an early lead with the US government, which may be jeopardized by Elon Musk’s falling out with President Trump. Google,Amazonand Microsoft all believe their cloud services will protect them, but have forgotten that capacity built for six or more major players in AI may be more than the winners will need for at least the next few years.The day may come sooner than many expect when shareholders, directors and executives will demand evidence that the massive investment in LLM technology will generate an adequate return for them. The answer will be no for many, if not most, players, and the reckoning will ugly for everyone.Roger McNamee is managing director at Elevation Partners and an early stage investor in Google and FacebookExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionChatGPTOpenAIMicrosoftAmazonGoogleMetacommentShareReuse this content"

One for the billionaire class. And one for everybody elseWed 24 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 24 Sep 2025 14.07 EDTShareLet’s take a deep breath and, for one moment, forget aboutDonald Trump,Jimmy Kimmel, theUN,Charlie Kirk, Gaza, a government shutdown and the other crises that we face.Let’s talk instead about the reality which the corporate-controlled media and the corporate-controlled political system don’t talk about very much.What we are witnessing right now is the rise of two Americas. One for the billionaire class. And one for everybody else.In one America, the richest people are becoming obscenely richer and have never, ever had it so good. That America is overflowing with unimaginable wealth, greed and opulence that makes the Gilded Age seem very modest.And then there is a second America – an America where a majority of people live paycheck to paycheck, struggling to secure the very basic necessities of life – food, healthcare, housing and education.The simple truth is that never before in our history have so few had so much wealth and power while so many live in economic desperation.In the first America, one man –Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, worth more than $480bn, owns more wealth than the bottom 52% of American households. After spending $290m to put Trump back into the White House, Musk has become more than $180bn richer since election day. That’s a pretty good return on his investment.But that’s apparently not good enough for Musk. In order to keep him “motivated” as CEO, Tesla’s board proposed giving him a $1tn pay package if he meets certain goals. A trillion dollars.Jeff Bezos, the fourth wealthiest person in the world, has a fortune of $233bn. He can sail to Venice on his $500m yacht for his reported $50m wedding, where he gave his wife a $3m-$5m ring – because, among other things, his effective tax rate is just a reported 1.1%.Mark Zuckerberg, the third richest person in the world, is worth $258bn. He has spent $110m to buy 11 homes in Palo Alto, California, to create his own private compound, and another $270m for more than 2,300 acres in Hawaii with a 5,000 sqft underground bunker and three yachts reportedly worth more than $530m.In the other America, where the vast majority of our people live, the economy is not just broken, it is collapsingLarry Ellison, the second wealthiest person in the world – worth $377bn – recently became nearly $100bn richer in a single day. He owns a private island in Hawaii and a fleet of jets, and now he’s reportedly trying to buy up major media companies such as Warner Bros and CNN.Together, these four men alone are worth more than $1.3tn. But it’s not just them. The top 1% now owns more wealth than the bottom 93%.The 1% lives in a world completely removed from ordinary Americans. They don’t ride overcrowded subways to get to work or sit in traffic jams to get home. They fly on private jets and helicopters they own. They live in mansions all over the world, send their kids to the most elite private schools and vacation on their own islands. And, for fun, some spend millions to fly off into space on their own rocket ships.And then there is the other America, where the vast majority of our people live. For them, the economy is not just broken, it is collapsing. In this America, despite a massive increase in worker productivity, real weekly wages for the average American worker are lower today than they were more than 52 years ago.In this America, people are unable to afford a doctor’s visit (if they’re lucky enough to find one); are paying over half of their limited incomes on rent or a mortgage; and are unable to afford the outrageous cost of childcare or send their kids to college. In this America, the price of vegetables, fruit and other healthy foods is beyond the budget for many.For most Americans, the system is not just broken, it is collapsing and is increasingly resembling life in the third world.Everyone needs healthcare. Yet today, more than 85 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured – a number that will rise by at least 15 million under Trump’s so-called big, beautiful bill.Everyone needs housing. Yet today, nearly 800,000 Americans are homeless and more than 20m households pay more than 50% of their limited incomes on rent or a mortgage. Since 2000, average rents have more than doubled and the median price of a home has soared to more than $435,000.Will the Democrats learn from Zohran Mamdani’s victory? | Bernie SandersRead moreEveryone needs a decent education. Yet today, our childcare system is broken and wildly expensive. Many of our public schools are dilapidated with teachers underpaid and underappreciated, and American students are falling behind in math, science and reading compared with their international peers. College education is unaffordable for millions and vocational schools fail to train the workers we desperately need.Everyone needs a secure retirement. Yet, nearly half of older workers have no retirement savings and no idea how they will ever retire with any shred of dignity or respect. Meanwhile, 22% of seniors are trying to survive on an income of less than $15,000 a year.Enough is enough.As supreme court justice Louis Brandeis said in 1933: “We can have democracy in this country or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of the few, but we cannot have both.”That warning is even more relevant today.In this pivotal moment in American history, we must create a government and an economy that works for all, or we will continue sliding into oligarchy – where the billionaire class controls our government, our economy and our future.Let me say to my fellow Americans: I know day-to-day life can take a toll, but we must not allow ourselves to fall into despair. If we do not allow ourselves to be divided up by Trump and his oligarch allies, we can change the path we are on.The choice is clear. Let’s stand together for democracy and justice.Explore more on these topicsUS economyOpinionMark ZuckerbergElon MuskDonald TrumpThe super-richEconomicsUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But the US president’s ‘tough it out’ message could harm mothers and babiesKate Womersley is a doctor and academic specialising in psychiatryWed 24 Sep 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 24 Sep 2025 10.36 EDTShareOn Monday, Donald Trump, flanked by Robert F Kennedy Jr and the former talkshow host and head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,Dr Mehmet Oz, announced thatwomen should avoid paracetamol(known as acetaminophen or by the brand name Tylenol in the US) throughout pregnancy because of a spurious link with childhood autism.This political theatre highlights a longstanding and harmful problem: pregnant women, and their babies, are routinely let down by partial, poor-quality and missing medical evidence. Pregnant women deserve better than irresponsible headlines raising fear based on shaky research that has failed to convince the scientific community.Compounding the problem, Trump’s announcement centred women’s choices as the driver of childhood outcomes. Only “if you can’t tough it out” as a pregnant woman, should you resort to treating your own pain and fever, Trump advised. This mistakenly and cruelly pitches women’s needs against the best interests of their baby, rather than seeing a mother and foetus as interdependent. Many women, however sceptical of the Trump administration’s approach to science, will now be burdened with unsubstantiated concerns about how their choices might endanger their pregnancy. Whatever they choose, there is a pathway for them to be blamed.To be clear: there is no credible evidence linking autism with maternal paracetamol use. The best available research points to the contrary:a large study from 2024that analysed data from 2.5 million women who gave birth in Sweden, and their babies, found no association between paracetamol use in pregnancy and childhood neurodiversity. The researchers looked at whether mothers of neurodivergent children took paracetamol during pregnancy, but also assessed the presence of known risk factors for autism, the indication for taking paracetamol, and family history of neurodiversity. After accounting for these factors, a childhood autism risk from paracetamol exposure was not identified. No new contradictory evidence was mentioned by Trump that should prompt us to review this reassuring conclusion.Cases of autism have been rising in recent years, in large part owing to shifting diagnostic categories as well as professional and public awareness about neurodiversity. Risk factors for autism are not fully understood, but include genetic, environmental, pregnancy and social variables. The main factor is your family history: if you are born into a family with siblings and parents who are autistic you are more likely to be too. It is important to underline the stigma that Trump’s announcement will add to neurodiversity diagnoses and the people who live (and thrive) with them.It is absolutely appropriate to ask the question whether pregnancy exposure to common medicines affects babies in utero and beyond. However, it is dificult to produce definitive answers here; the research is difficult to do well,requiring meticulous design and careful reporting of results. Trump’s announcement was nothing like this; it was essentially speculation, and it could have serious consequences.Untreated illnesses during pregnancy can be harmful, not only for women’s long-term health, but also for their baby. The “precautionary approach” is often mentioned: if there is any concern about paracetamol, shouldn’t women avoid it to be better safe than sorry? But precaution should go both ways. There is a cost when encouraging pregnant women not to take a effective medicine for pain and fever. These symptoms affect women’s health, functioning and wellbeing, while untreated fever could pose risk to the baby. Research is ongoing, but it appears that maternal fever could have negative effects on thebaby’s brain development.Discouraging paracetamol use risks pushing women who are in need of pain relief towards unlicensed treatments or alternative analgesia such as ibuprofen. Unlike paracetamol, ibuprofen poses proven risks in pregnancy in different trimesters, including miscarriage, foetal kidney damage and premature closure of an important blood vessel (the ductus arteriosus) in the foetus. These risks far outweigh any possible link between paracetamol and childhood autism.Today is an opportunity to discuss how we assess the safety of medicines in pregnancy. Few research studies include equal numbers of women and men, and the data is often not compared appropriately to see if there are sex differences in outcomes. Even fewer medicines are studied in pregnancy. After the thalidomide andsodium valproatescandals, there are still understandable public fears about the potential harm of medication on babies, although neither of these drugs were studied in pregnant women before reaching the market. Rather than exporting risk at scale into the population, efforts should be made to build the evidence base safely by bringing pregnant women who want to be involved into biomedical research.That’s why Dr Ed Mullins, an obstetrician, and I are collaborating onMessage Maternity, a project to bring together healthcare researchers, research funders, medicines regulators, legal experts and medical publishers and most importantly women themselves to understand why those who are pregnant are routinely excluded from research, and how we might safely and respectfully change the culture from exclusion towards inviting women’s inclusion in support of patient autonomy, and informed decision making. We want to minimise harm on an immense scale, which could occur when pregnant women are given incorrect medical advice.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The lead-up to the event elicited a torrent of recollections.A thought-provoking outcome of sharing stories with people I have barely thought about in decades was the realisation of just how individual, unique and incomplete our memories can be.I know some peoplefind the prospect of school reunions terrifying. I’m fortunate that high school was an OK time for me. I was studious, had a great group of friends and was perhaps protected from some adolescent angst by the fact I was a full year younger than everyone else.As the event approached, I teamed up with friends I’m still in regular contact with to try to place the various ex-classmates into the reunion-planning group chat. Being at high school in the 1980s meant we preceded the social media era where it’s easy to keep connections.Unlike private schools, we never had a formal alumni program. In fact, our school doesn’t even exist any more, thanks to being “Jeffed” during the 1990s Kennett era of school mergers and closures in Victoria.Readers reply: Are school and college reunions good for us?Read moreAs I travelled to Melbourne from far northern New South Wales, I thought about various events from my school years that would be fun to share with my former classmates.The memories were decidedly adolescent-themed; like how shocked I was by two students who fuelled their year 12 studies with No-Doz caffeine tablets. Similarly, I wanted to share about how impressed I was during year 11 camp by those who drank alcohol from tin mugs around the campfire, who avoided being caught and punished like others who snuck their drinks away.I was also keen to revisit the shared saga of how – in my memory – we were dismissed from school only to be enveloped in the great Melbourne dust storm of 1983.I expected to have some fun sharing these recollections but, instead, I was disconcerted to repeatedly discover my memories didn’t stand up to others’ retellings.It turns out some of my memories only scratched the surface of the truth; with one of the No-Doz-takers revealing these tablets were the lightest of the drugs he and his friend took during our school years. Other memories proved to be as insignificant to the other parties as they were life-changing for me, illustrated by one of the campfire alcohol drinkers having no memory of their actions.Yet more of my memories turned out to be somewhere between inadequately recalled or plain wrong. I clearly remember being told by teachers to leave school mid-afternoon on 7 February 1983 in order to get home before the dust storm. Yet others recall being locked inside and watching the day turn to darkness from classroom windows as teachers screamed.Given my research showed the storm approached right at the end of the school day, perhaps the truth lies in the middle. One woman admitted she chose to ignore announcements made to departing students to head back inside. Yet, I can’t imagine I – an obedient non-risktaker – would have been this brave, leaving my memories and understanding of this event almost as hazy as the skies were that day.So beneath the chat, hugs, laughter, selfies, serious conversations and even a few tears, the reunion turned out to be as thought-provoking as it was fun. Even when dealing with relatively light memories unaffected bytrauma, substance use or external pressures to remember things a certain way, my memories turned out to be scarily fickle, situation-specific and labile.It’s tempting to want to defend the veracity of our recollections, as memory is effectively our personal versions of the truth. Yet sharing (or not sharing) details of past events with old classmates has left me more open to accepting that,philosophically speaking, we can never fully rely on our memories.It’s also left me very glad that I’ve had no need to testify in a court case. I’m not sure I would trust my memory enough to feel sure I could tell the whole truth.The reunion did unearth one standout contrast to my woolly and even discombobulating experiences of memory, courtesy of the one person who was significantly older than my ex-classmates.Despite having taught me English for only one year nearly 40 years ago, Mr Lyons floored me by recalling that I had three sisters and told me how much he enjoys reading my articles.So, after musing on memory for a full year after the reunion, I would like to award Mr Lyons an A+ in the subject of amazing high-school teachers. And, I have set myself the ongoing homework of reading and understanding more about the incredibly complex world of memory.Vivienne Pearson is a freelance writer.

It was the second time I had defeated the government-backed candidate. The first was in 2019 when the mayoral electionswere annulledon flimsy pretexts; voters returned to the polls andhanded us a victoryby an even larger margin.But this year, democracy in Turkey has entered its most perilous phase. The process started in Marchon the eve of my nomination as the presidential candidate of the CHP, the century-old Republican People’s party. This was when my university degree wasabruptly annulled. Why is this relevant? Because, under the Turkish constitution, one must have a university degree to be able to run for president. Soon after, I was accused of corruption and “aiding a terrorist organisation”. For six months, I have been behind bars, arrested on politically motivatedcorruption chargesbased on“anonymous” witnesses. In a country bound by the European convention on human rights, this is an outrage.Nor am I alone. Across Turkey,more than a dozen mayorsfrom the oppositionare now imprisoned. Sadly, the numbers arerising all the time; more than a quarter of Istanbul’s districts have hadtheir elected leaders arrested,silencing millions of voters in one of the world’s great cities.From mayors inAdana and Antalya, to municipal staff in Istanbul, repression has reached every level. Hundreds of peoplelanguish in prison, including journalists, academics, businesspeople and students.Enes Hocaoğulları, a youth delegate to the Council of Europe,was detainedfor merely speaking out under Turkey’s vaguely worded lawson “misleading” the public. This shows how far the crackdown has gone. His release, after protests at home and abroad, is a small but telling victory for democratic resistance.I’ve never seen such clampdowns in Istanbul. Turkey’s democracy is fighting for its life | Orhan PamukRead moreLet me be clear about what is happening. In the arrogance of unchecked power, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is once more weaponising the courts against the democratic opposition. This time, opponents are being imprisoned and replaced with loyalists. Unable to shut down the CHP, the government is pursuing a case that will have the effect of erasing the CHP’s rising leadership by overturningthe outcomeof its 2023 national party congress. Earlier this month, a court moved to annul the CHP’s local congress in Istanbul,remove its chairand install a trustee.The case against the CHP, which the government keeps dragging out in hopes of destabilising the main opposition and removing its legitimate leadership, marks a turning point in the effective dismantling of political pluralism. A system where judges replace elected leaders with handpicked stand-ins is no democracy at all.Having hollowed out the republic’s institutions to build an authoritarian regime, Erdoğan now seeks to fabricate a compliant, hollow opposition. He intends to rewrite the rules so no genuine rival could survive, securing power in the style of Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak or Syria’s Assads. These are deliberate methods likely to be copied elsewhere tomorrow unless democrats everywhere stand together to resist them.Erdoğan’s increasingly repressive tacticsexpose his eroding popular supportand his desperatebid to preserve power. To avoid another defeat in the ballot box, he rewrites the rules. He relies on smear campaigns, corruption charges, efforts to divide the opposition and the ever-present “terrorist” label. Yet, this display of power has further undermined his legitimacy, leaving him increasingly dependent on a narrow minority and the machinery of the state.The people of Turkey are no longer deceived. Protests fill the streets, and polls consistently place CHP as the country’s leading party. Since 19 March, the day I was detained and jailed, millions of citizens, even in Erdoğan’s supposed strongholds, have been participating in peaceful protests to demand justice and change, despite the risk of arrest and police violence. This resistance reflects Turkey’s 150-year tradition of parliamentary democracy. But resistance alone is not enough.That is why the CHP is preparing a comprehensive roadmap for democratic transition, to build a resilient and inclusive alliance: win elections; stabilise the economy; restore judicial independence; combat corruption and organised crime; expand social rights; rebuild trust in institutions; and redefine Turkey’s role in a changing geopolitical landscape.Turkey’s fight for democracy, freedom and justice is not Turkey’s alone. If a nation whose experience proves that democracy is a universal project slides deeper into autocracy, the consequences will reverberate far beyond its borders.Yet I remain convinced: the will of the people will prevail. Our outrage in the face of injustices must be turned into a strategy. That strategy must involve building a new political culture and institutions that honour Turkey’s democratic legacy. If we achieve that, we will not only reclaim our democracy at home but help it rise again across the world.Ekrem Imamoğlu is the elected mayor of Istanbul and the presidential candidate for Turkey’s main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP)Explore more on these topicsTurkeyOpinionRecep Tayyip ErdoğanFreedom of speechProtestEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Parliament’s two biggest parties see each other as arch enemies – status that affords some mutual respect. The Lib Dems are treated more like pests, ideological shapeshifters, wheedling their way into voters’ affections, burrowing into local politics. If allowed to nest in a constituency, they are notoriously hard to shift.Kemi Badenoch has asevere infestation in her back yard. Of the 72 seats currently held by Ed Davey’s party, 60 were taken from Conservatives. The former seats of three Tory prime ministers – David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson – are now represented by Lib Dem MPs. That pattern was repeatedin this year’s local elections, when the Lib Dems gained 163 seats almost entirely at the Tories’ expense.Badenoch shows no inclination to fight back, nor any comprehension of why her party surrendered its heartland. Earlier this year shedismissed Davey’s troops as peoplewho “don’t have much of an ideology other than being nice”; the sort of busybodies “who are good at fixing their church roof”.Such disdain for undogmatic civic engagement explains why the Conservatives, who once defined themselves aslittle platoonsfired by that spirit, are slumped in irrelevant torpor. It gives Davey hope of advancing further into areas with a critical mass of voters who were amenable to the Conservatism of Cameron or May, receptive at first to Johnson’s bonhomie, latterly disgusted by his mendacity and appalled by the chaotic aftermath. Dismay turns to alarm at the sight of Tories shrivelling and hardening in cowardly imitation of Reform UK.Davey’s keynote speechat this week’s Lib Dem conference in Bournemouth led with an invitation to make common cause with “millions of one-nation Conservatives who reject the divisive politics of Badenoch and Farage”.Kemi Badenoch says Lib Dems are people who fix church roofs. Yes: that’s why we’re popular and she isn‘t | Ed DaveyRead moreTheReform UKleader is central to the pitch because he embodies a style of politics that horrifies Davey’s target audience, galvanising an electoral coalition that would otherwise lack coherence.Alongside queasy centre-right ex-Conservatives, the Lib Dems need to recruit more left-leaning voters who might support them out of tactical necessity, or who backed Keir Starmer in 2024, hoping for muscular social democracy, and feel demoralised by his compromises in office.It is a familiar conundrum for a party with a history of poaching seats by tacking alternately left and right in opposition to whatever the incumbent government happened to be doing. Davey knows the dangers of weather-vane opportunism. He wasone of 49 Lib Dem MPsblown out of the Commons in 2015by the typhoon of voter scornfor a party that had swapped pious leftish opposition under Labour for cosy cabinet jobs under a Tory prime minister five years earlier.Last year’s success at borrowing millions of votes from Labour supporters to turf out Tories suggests the sin of coalition has been expiated. The passage of time helps. A bigger factor is the seismic disruption of Brexit, scrambling allegiances and burying grudges.For many remain voters, pre-referendum politics now appears in rosy retrospect as a time of general moderation and rationality.Liberal democracy, broadly defined as support for institutions and cultural norms that uphold individual freedom, representative government and the rule of law, was the undisputed mainstream consensus. There were plenty of liberals on Labour and Conservative benches. The party that wears the doctrine in its name seemed sometimes otiose.Brexit changed that. It was a nationalist programme. The pseudo-liberal free-trading school of Euroscepticism soon revealed itself to be nothing more than a lobby for subordination to America-first protectionism. The cause of liberal democracy started to look imperilled in Britain, as it has across Europe and the US.The Lib Dems briefly looked like the nation’s primary electoral vehicle for expressing alarm at that trend and grief at separation from the EU.They came secondto Farage’s Brexit party in the 2019 European parliament elections.Then they wildly over-reached with a pledge torevoke the commitment to leave, dispensing even with the courtesy of a second referendum – an affront to democracy that made even passionate remainers flinch. The subsequent general election was settled by Johnson’s double appeal as purveyor of a quick fix to get Brexit done and the man who would stop Jeremy Corbyn entering Downing Street. It was another near-extinction event for the Lib Dems.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionSince his voter base is stacked with ex-Conservatives, Davey can’t risk evangelical Europhilia, but he leans further into the economic case for re-integration than Starmer. His conference speech restated the policy of a customs union to put Britain “on a path to the single market”.More significant was the Lib Dem leader’s readiness to cite Brexit as evidence of Farage’s general unfitness for office. He was, as Davey said, “champion” for the cause. That ought to be an electoral liability when a majority of British people now judge it on a scale from disappointment to calamity.An even clearer majority dislike Donald Trump. Farage’s enthusiasm for the US president – on a personal level and as a model for aggressive xenophobic policy – is a clear vulnerability for Reform UK; an open goal.But Starmer dribbles delicately around the box for fear of causing offence in the White House. Badenoch is stuck at the back of the stands, chanting for a more cerebral, less popular brand of populism. That has left Davey clear to take the shot. His speech outlined the contest between a “silent majority” of moderate, compassionate patriots who actually like their home country, and Faragist fanatics who hate modern Britain and would twist and fold it into Trump’s America.This argument can be pressed hard without fear of alienating potential supporters. Lib Dem MPs aren’t at riskfrom direct voter traffic to Reform. There is hardly any overlap between the two parties’ intended audiences and their existing backersbarely even consider switching from one to the other. That clarifies Davey’s task as a project to organise the local anti-Farage coalition in target seats. It brings a relatively sharp focus to a party whose identity has often been blurred as a function of showing different faces in different seats, depending on the party of the closest local rival.The old contradictions aren’t ironed out. Lib Dems participate in the same fiscal fictions as everyone else. They demand costly improvements in public services while complaining about tax rises. They reject any budget measure that grazes the wallets of their affluent suburban and rural voters and spend hypothetical revenue from growth to be generated by unexplained economic alchemy.But there is no ambiguity on the question of what kind of country Britain wants to be; whether we want to see the finely interwoven sinews of cultural diversity and social tolerance picked apart by sharp-suited thugs and vaporised under flamethrowers of Trumpian demagoguery. In the lost era of liberal democratic consensus, it wasn’t always clear what the point was of a party called the Liberal Democrats. Now they have an urgent cause to align with their name.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLiberal DemocratsOpinionEd DaveyReform UKConservativesNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

Their weakness is undermining the democratic principles on which the EU was builtWed 24 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 24 Sep 2025 07.00 EDTShareWhen Ursula von der Leyen made her pitch to become president of the European Commission back in 2019, she put the“European way”at the heart of her appeal. Under her direction, she said, Europe would be a principled power built on multilateralism, fair trade and the rules-based order, standing firm and united against authoritarianism, protectionism and the politics of zero-sum thinking.Six years on, she is again calling on Europe to “fight” for that future. But the vision is fading fast. This summer brought a cascade of negative headlines decryingEurope’s “humiliation”; it was the worst in years, if not in a century, some critics said. All pointed to the same reality: European leaders, fearing both a trade war and the loss of US support for Ukraine, had bowed to the wishlist of the Trump administration and left their tariff-retaliation toolbox untouched. Τhey lavished the US president with praise and applauded an agreement that was anything but balanced. Dressed up as pragmatism, it felt like capitulation to many Europeans.But the issue runs much deeper than a lopsided trade “deal”. Europe’s overt submission to Trump is emblematic of a broader malaise. EU leaders and institutions are not only bending to the hardening authoritarianism across the Atlantic. They also routinely placate far-right forces at home. In doing so, they corrode the very values and principles – democracy, rule of law, open markets and climate responsibility – that they claim to uphold. And often, with a tone of moral superiority, remind others to follow.The pattern plays out across several policy areas.In recent years, EU migration policy has become a clear marker of how Europe’s values have drifted. Under pressure from the far right, EU governments and institutions alike are framing migration as athreatinstead of a source of strength for Europe’s societies and economies. This has consequences for the rule of law and human rights. Illegalpushbacksare routinely tolerated. NGOs conducting rescue missions in the Mediterranean faceobstruction. And “migration deals” with countries such as Tunisia effectivelyoutsourceEurope’s accountability to governments that openly flout human rights. The Schengen Agreement, once a symbol of European integration, risks becoming collateral damage as temporary border checks turnsemi-permanentin several EU countries under the pretext of migration pressure.A similar political dynamic has begun to undermine the EU’s climate ambitions. The European Green Deal, once hailed by Von der Leyen as “Europe’s man-on-the-moon moment” has increasingly fallen prey to a far-right crusade casting climate policies as an elite imposition burdening farmers, businesses and ordinary citizens. Centre-right parties, eager to capitalise on the momentum, have joined in. They profess commitment to Europe’s climate ambitions. But instead of making a forthright case for the Green Deal’s economic and societal benefits, and engaging in a serious debate among democratic forces on the best path forward, these parties have increasingly chosen todilute or delaykey measures – even if it means aligning themselves with parties on the far right, and far from the EU’s democratic centre.Many of these decisions are defended in the name of pragmatic realism. Submission to Trump, some argue, buys Europe time since de-risking, strengthening defence and implementing deeper reforms cannot happen overnight. Stricter migration policies are presented as reflecting the will of the overwhelmed people, irrespective of possible human rights violations. Climate ambitions are to besloweduntil economic growth and innovation “catch up”. And with elections always looming somewhere in the EU, many mainstream parties warn they must act on voters’ “real issues” or risk handing victory to the far right.View image in fullscreenA man waves a giant Palestinian flag in Berlin, Germany, 20 September 2025.Photograph: Clemens Bilan/EPAUnder pressure from illiberal forces at home and abroad, leaders are increasingly deciding to trade longstanding principles for the illusion of stability. However, history shows this damage-limitation strategy cannot win over authoritarian actors. And each concession chips away at the stigma that once kept far-right ideas at the margins. What was once extreme is increasingly treated as normal, putting the rule of law and democracy under strain across the continent. The problem is no longer confined to specific policy areas or individual member states such as Hungary or Slovakia. From German local authorities attempting to oppress pro-Palestiniandemonstrations, Italy’s prime ministerdiscreditingthe judiciary for blocking her migration policies, the European People’s party campaigning in Brussels todelegitimise NGOs, to several EU governmentscallingto reinterpret the European convention on human rights, a dangerous pattern is emerging across the EU.Once European leaders begin treating fundamental rights, the courts and civil society as obstacles to the popular will, they open the door to a dangerous slide, where upholding values shifts from obligation to discretion.Nowhere is this selective application of values more glaring than in the EU’s response to Gaza. Its persistent failure to take meaningful action against Israel’sflagrant violationsof human rights and international law risks leaving a lasting scar on its global credibility. Even the commission president’sfreezing of bilateral supportfor Israel, and proposal to sanction extremist ministers and violent settlers and partially suspend the EU-Israel association agreement, came only after two years of inaction.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Defending them is not naive idealism – it is a strategic necessity, both to counter authoritarianism at home and to shape a rules-based, multipolar world abroad.If European leaders remain still and silent, hoping Trump will simply fade away, they risk giving up not just their dignity but their political agency. By doing so, they are allowing far-right forces to fill the void and tilt the balance permanently. Globally, the only viable path is to build new partnerships – but these will only take root if Europe remains united and defends the values it professes to hold with the same conviction it demands from others. The same is true at home: placating the far right by adopting far-right policies does not neutralise extremism: it legitimises it and hollows out the union from within. Instead, Europe must actively champion pluralism, the rule of law, open societies and climate action as sources of strength.If the “European way” is to mean anything, Europe must finally stand up for what it stands for – not just in words, but in action.Thu Nguyen is deputy director of the Jacques Delors Centre at the Hertie School in Berlin.Jannik Jansen is a policy fellow at the same instituteDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Loneliness makes them get sicker and stay sicker for longerRanjana SrivastavaOne of the greatest acts of love is simply bearing witness to the vicissitudes of ageingTue 23 Sep 2025 22.56 EDTLast modified on Wed 24 Sep 2025 02.53 EDTShareOf the many patients over age 75 on my medical unit, half arewhat providers describeas “young old” and the remainder as “old old”. Admittedly, this delineation is somewhat arbitrary and the subsequent assessment provides more nuance, but it helps us triage patient needs.Before the actual round, my team does a paper round. We run through the bread-and-butter issues of any internal medicine ward: heart failure, bad emphysema, rampant diabetes, cognitive decline, frequent falls, frailty.Besides the medical details, we scrutinise the social circumstances. Does the patient live alone? (about 35% ofpeople over 85do).Is there any home help? (thewaitlist for servicesis painfully long).Who takes them out and how often? From the time patients enter the hospital, we need to know what it will take to get them safely out of hospital.The first of five nonagenarians is sitting expressionless in his room. He is cognitively impaired and has had a fall. To help him, I need more history.“Sir, do you have any family?”Labor’s Measuring What Matters is a worthy goal – but one that has utterly failed to live up to its promise | Greg JerichoRead more“My children.”“Where are they?”“I don’t know.”It will be three full days before we manage to contact someone.An 87-year-old lady complains bitterly about “rattling” from all the pills but can’t name even one. For safe prescribing, we ask if someone might bring in her medications. She starts crying that her children are too busy to care for her, and we hastily say we will call her pharmacy.We weave our way through patients, all elderly and almost all alone, even though it is the weekend. Some are too sick to talk or sound asleep from exhaustion. Most of those awake look forlorn and trapped. A patient asks if we can rub her feet like her husband used to. Another asks who can trim his toenails. The best we can do is nudge their food closer or stick a straw into an array of unopened drinks.One patient looks especially dire on paper. Age 90, lungs decimated by years of smoking. A respiratory episode that may just spell the end of his life. In case there is no interpreter, I prepare myself for a Google Translate encounter.But we are astonished to see the man sitting up brightly, no oxygen in sight. Three amicable men flank him, dressed in attire ranging from a suit to paint-stained overalls, laughing and joking with him.One son provides a history, the other furnishes his medications, the third serves up mouth-watering Turkish fare to put the hospital food to shame.They all confirm that their dad feels fine and jump at the thought of taking him home. One son will spend the night with his parents, and the others will take turns. Their confidence is infectious. When he understands what’s happening, the patient attacks his food with gusto and gives us a high five – the sickest patient has the best outcome!This happy scene on an otherwise sombre round feels like a gift. We see how the most useful “intervention” was the physical presence and moral support of the patient’s children.In the empty stairwell, out of earshot, a young doctor sighs, “It’s so sad to see all these lonely people with no visitors.” Another observes that this treatment of elderly people seems a particular feature of western culture, recounting that our elderly Vietnamese patient has been attended day and night by his two children and the Greek lady had so many concerned nephews and nieces that we had to beg for space.Then, as if discomfited by our observations and not wanting to “be judgy”, we reach for reasons why the children of our patients might stay away. They are working, raising children and grandchildren and grappling with competing demands of their own. Some children can’t face a parent’s vulnerability. Others are tired of caring, and the hospitalisation is their break. Conflict and estrangement also fray family ties.But what we also know for sure is that loneliness makes elderly patients get sicker and stay sicker for longer: doctors can’t medicate the way out of this societal malady.I treat this issue with added interest, the product of an Indian tradition that has observed filial piety without necessarily stating such a notion.When my grandparents were ill, the men did the earning and the women (all) the caring.By the time illness visited my parents’ generation, the responsibility was spread across their sons and daughters, although not always evenly.Birth control: why are influencers turning away from the pill and towards natural contraceptive methods? | AntiviralRead moreMy extended family is like any other modern family, pressed with the usual obligations, but we will crisscross continents to be at the side of parents without being asked or told. In this, we are not unique.But there is a sense that, in this age, only the economically privileged, flexibly employed or uncommonly devoted can afford to take time off to help their ageing parents. I question this when I see some of the most personally tested and socially disadvantaged adults being the most selfless providers to their parents.No one I know finds attending to the needs of ageing parents convenient or necessarily desirable. After all, it is surely a rite of passage to drive your parents nuts and then be driven nuts by your parents. But it seems to me that those who show up don’t frame it as a matter of choice but, rather, priority. And if you consider something or someone your priority, you are more likely to make the time.I don’t know the answer but I see the dilemma.Hospitalspacked with elderly people whose every problem is magnified by loneliness and a dearth of love and attention. Our costliest medicines don’t touch them and the fleeting kindness of strangers is unfortunately just that.I have begun to think that one of the greatest acts of love is simply bearing witness to the vicissitudes of ageing.Better social policies might help but they will never replace individual obligation.Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

So, up top: I don’t know anyone depicted in The Hack, Jack Thorne’s seven-part drama about Guardian journalist Nick Davies’s investigation into the scandal of the phone-hacking perpetrated by various members of Rupert Murdoch’s News International, which led to seven major police investigations, nearly 40 convictions and the closing of theNews of the World. I’ve never met Davies or the then editor of the paper, with whom the drama is almost as concerned, Alan Rusbridger (beyond a handshake from on high, literally and metaphorically – he’s much taller than Toby Jones, who plays him here – in a crowded tent at Hay-on-Wye 20 years ago). Disclaimer ends. Let’s get cracking!‘We should have been shouting about this earlier’: David Tennant on his shocking TV show about phone hackingRead moreThe Hack opens in 2008, when Davies – played byDavid Tennantwith his customary tension and earnestness, which I always find distractingly effortful, though I remain aware that I am in the minority – is tipped off about the News of the World hacking into the voicemails of celebrities to garner gossip and stories, with pictures and other evidence gathered after the fact to disguise the illegal source. The editor, Andy Coulson, had resigned in the wake of “one rogue reporter” doing so the year before. In fact, the practice is endemic. And Coulson is now director of communications for the then prime minister, David Cameron, which puts the story firmly within the public interest. Davies starts the painstaking business of stacking it up, then re-stacking as it becomes bigger and bigger and the Metropolitan police’s connection – sliding into complicity? cooperation? corruption? – with the tabloids becomes an ever more prominent part of his discoveries over the next six years.View image in fullscreen‘Get it on the record!’ … Toby Jones as then Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger in The Hack.Photograph: ITVThe problem is that stitching together a sprawling story as Davies did is, in televisual terms, very boring – especially when played out across a very indulgent seven-hour run. More failed phone calls. More dead ends. More reluctant celebrities. More lawyers telling him to be patient, more Rusbridger telling him he needs more quotes, more documents, more names on the record. Small breakthroughs. Cowardly silence from the rest of the press. Thorne tries to liven things up with many breakings of the fourth wall by Tennant – wryly commenting on this and that, looking knowingly at the camera, taking part in little dreamlike sequences – but this only undermines any sense that the writer trusts his story and his viewers and further detaches us from a narrative that until the final couple of episodes cannot build up a head of steam.More propulsive is the secondary strand, about detective David Cook (brilliantly played by Robert Carlyle) and his gradual realisation, as he works the murder case of the private investigator Daniel Morgan, of how enmeshed the media and the Metropolitan police were. But they are too long apart for the one to borrow much energy from the other.The Hack is stymied, too, by the fact that unlike, say, another drama about an appalling scandal,Mr Bates vs the Post Office, it deals mostly in ideals (and journalistic ideals at that) rather than the human emotions that make ideals real and valuable to us in life and as viewers. Abstraction is harder to care about.View image in fullscreenFar more propulsive … Eve Myles as Jacqui Hames and Robert Carlyle as Dave Cook.Photograph: ITV StudiosOn top of that, the script is deeply lacklustre. It is repetitive (there is barely a character that doesn’t tell Nick he looks tired and he twice apologises to Rusbridger “for making your life difficult”). It simply has bad lines (“We’re in a firefight here! They’re going to keep slinging mud until something sticks”) and bad ideas (such as the recurring dung beetle trundling across the screen to remind us of the aphorism about eating lots of faeces before you can fly).Also, it has a suffocating reverence for its subject that frequently borders on risible. Davies is a saint whose violent childhood has given him “a deep-seated urge to hit back against anyone who takes power and abuses it” and whose ex-wife still tells the children they have “an impressive dad” while making them watch and read everything he does. Rusbridger is full of cringe-makingly heroic lines (“My life? This is bigger than me”), and the air of smug righteousness that suffuses the drama (apparently unironically, for those who are about to write in saying there could be no better commentary on the leftwing media) is deeply unendearing.Between the sprawl and the tone, much is lost. What remains feels oddly quaint. So many worse instances of police corruption, abuses of political and institutional power, the erosion of personal and collective privacy and other rights have emerged since the world was convulsed by social media that the damage News International did seems to sit in a different landscape. The Hack almost transforms into a period piece about – God help us – simpler, happier times.The Hack aired on ITV1 and is on ITVX now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDavid TennantToby JonesPhone hackingNational newspapersNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesreviewsShareReuse this content"

It wasn’t that Porter was angling for another collaboration. On the contrary: “I felt it was unadaptable because of it being a kind of weather system in Shy’s head. Also, I was a bit worried about all my content being wrung out for adaptations.”By the end, I was knitting bootees for one of the young actors who’d just become a dadFast-forward two years and Shy was out in the world. Murphy, meanwhile, had set up his own film company, Big Things, and was “trying to dream up a project” to follow its award-winning debut, Small Things Like These, about abusive church workhouses for unwed mothers in Ireland. “Myself and Max talk all the time,” he says. Both have sons. Murphy comes from a family of teachers, while Porter has a sideline teaching in prisons and spent part of lockdown mentoring boys excluded from school. They decided that they would like to do something about care. “Not anything particularly about masculinity at that stage,” says Porter, “but something to do with the care system.”View image in fullscreen‘I wondered what I’d got myself into’... Tracey Ullman and Murphy in Steve.Photograph: Robert Viglasky/Netflix/PAThere was just one problem. “While I adore Shy as a piece of literature,” says Murphy, “I recognised that it was unadaptable.” In the background of the novel, though, was the shadowy figure of the headteacher, Steve, a benign but minor presence. “Then,” Porter picks up, “I said, ‘How about we do Steve and I just leave the book behind?’ I started again completely.”The result is a virtuosic piece of expressionistic storytelling set in a last-chance remand school in the 1990s, where overworked and underpaid staff struggle to nurture boys written off by society. It is simultaneously a cry of rage about a dysfunctional system, cut beyond the bone by a previous era of axe-wielding Tories, and a demonstration of why teenagers like Shy are worth saving, despite their often monstrous behaviour. Shy, for example, has trashed a shop, crashed an Escort, stabbed a finger (his stepdad’s) and broken a nose (we don’t find out whose).Porter wrote the screenplay himself – his first – with a starring role for Murphy as the embattled headteacher presiding over a rabble of boys. There was a trio of women: a fierce but motherly deputy head, a student counsellor and a timid new staff member. Before long, Tracey Ullman, Emily Watson and Simbiatu Ajikawo – AKA Little Simz – had signed up.Casting the pupils was a bigger job. “We saw 3,500 kids,” says Murphy. One stood out for Shy. Jay Lycurgo was born in 1998, two years after the film takes place. In the mid-90s, his dad played for Manchester United, but had since switched to work in pupil referral. “I got the email saying I had the audition,” says Lycurgo, “and I was like, ‘Dad, can I come and see you?’ I went to his office and ended up going to schools for a few weeks.”I’m interviewing them all in a rabbit’s warren of hotel rooms the morning after the red-carpet London premiere of Steve. It has been a whirlwind few days, with well-received premieres also in Toronto and Cork. “A drama suffused with gonzo energy and the death-metal chaos of emotional pain,”wrote Peter Bradshaw in this paper, “cut with slashes of bizarre black humour.”Variety’s Peter Debruge enthused: “A profoundly moving and superbly acted diamond in the rough.”View image in fullscreenHoliday reading … Murphy and Max Porter.Photograph: Mat Hayward/The Hollywood Reporter/Getty ImagesPorter, Murphy and director Tim Mielants sit in separate rooms, looking washed out. Ullman is stuck in bed upstairs with a croaky voice, but Lycurgo and Ajikawo are in the same room, fizzing with energy and banter. They are delighted to discover that they were both rejects of the Brit school of performing arts. Ajikawo admits that she didn’t even get an audition, while Lycurgo recalls turning up with a tear-jerking audition speech he had done for GCSE and forgetting the first line. “I didn’t get in because I thought acting was crying,” he says.The film takes place over a single day and was shot in sequence over 29 days with a two-week rehearsal period beforehand for the boys to get to know each other. Mielants, who is Belgian and talks in metaphors, was still working on post-production for Small Things Like These when he was presented with the script. It could hardly have been more different, he says. Whereas Small Things had “a very small top-of-the-iceberg dialogue over a lot of silences, Max wrote a script that built a cathedral of words on top of the iceberg. So it’s like, ‘Wow. How am I going to do this?’”It helped that he had been suffering a midlife crisis, he adds, caused by his father’s Alzheimer’s and the death of his brother, which had sent him back to family videos from the 1990s. “I wanted to see my parents, my grandparents again. And I understood the value in seeing them talking to camera.” This experience informed the film’s grainy, handheld aesthetic, and the idea of getting every resident of the house to do an interview direct to camera, describing themselves in three words. While the boys are boisterous, Steve is tearful and lost for words. “I’m looking at him instead of trying to understand him,” says Mielants. “And that’s where the surrealness comes back.”The film is partly a love letter to the clashing musical cultures of the 1990s. “Max was sending me all these playlists,” says Mielants. “So I was story-boarding while listening to drum’n’bass, which wasn’t my kind of music. Then I started seeing stuff upside down, which was more like getting inside the minds of Steve and the boys. I was 16 in 1996 when that music was around. And I remember the energy and all these chemicals going through your body. I felt that the visuals should represent that feeling.”The idea of filming in sequence over a short period came from Murphy, inspired by working with Ken Loach on The Wind that Shakes the Barley. Normally before taking a role, he says: “I lock myself away for months, reading and just walking around, talking to myself and developing a physicality and a voice. For this one, because I grew up in a house with teachers as parents, and I was a relatively troublesome kid at school – not in a malicious way but just annoying – I felt I had it to draw on. And because we were shooting chronologically, and Steve is so behind the curve with everything – underfunded, lacking in sleep, with a boy who is deteriorating – I wanted to be behind the curve all the time, stumbling over words and trying desperately to hold everything together. I didn’t want to be super-prepped.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s a love letter’ ... Jay Lycurgo, left, and Simbiatu Ajikawo AKA Little Simz.Photograph: Robert Viglasky/Netflix/PAThe unspoken subtext to the film is the differences – and similarities – between the mid-1990s and today. While dictaphones, Sony Walkmans and rackety old Renault 5s might seem quaint, underfunding of the care system and the vilification of young men are only too familiar. “Hopefully what it highlights is that the problems that these kids have are for ever,” says Murphy. “They existed pre-technology and pre-internet and pre-social media. They’ve just been exacerbated by the development of this stuff.”Teenage boys, it seems, are all too easy to write off. “I think they’re an easy target, statistically and ideologically. And certainly in Ireland and in the UK the suicide rate among young men is staggeringly and tragically high,” he adds. For all that, in person, Lycurgo seems nothing like the tempestuous Shy, he knows all too well what Murphy is talking about. “I deal with mental health every day in my own personal struggles,” he says.At school, Lycurgo was cheeky and distracted, more interested in football than studying. It wasn’t until he was 19 that he discovered he had dyslexia and could have done with the sort of personal attention he saw in his father’s referral units. His breakthrough as Shy was to realise he could use that vulnerability. “I felt like it was a piece of me that I just had to show to everyone. So it’s not necessarily like, ‘I’ve got this character.’ It’s like, ‘OK, cool. How can I use it to respect Shy and to respect the material?’”By the time Ullman and Ajikawo arrived on set, the actors playing the boys had boisterously bonded. “They were so feral and hostile I wondered what I’d got myself into,” says Ullman. “But as a grandmother, I get that boy energy, and their vulnerability. I began to enjoy it. By the end, I was knitting bootees for one of them who had just become a dad.”Shy by Max Porter review – lyrical study of troubled youthRead moreAjikawo had the added pressure of balancing rehearsals with the run-up to an appearance alongside Coldplay on Glastonbury’s Pyramid stage, which was booked for the weekend filming wrapped. While in person, she is stylish and articulate, in the film she is a dowdy mouse. “I missed the workshops,” she says, “which I think was kind of cool and true to where I fit into the story – because I’m new to the school.”In her other persona, as Little Simz, she wrote a song for the film. “I wanted it to feel like a 90s banger, as well as having moments of tenderness,” she says. “But also, Shy loves jungle, so let’s get some great beats in there.” The track is called Don’t Leave Too Soon. Looking at rough-cuts of the film, she realised, at heart, it was a race to save Shy from himself. She looks warmly at the actor who brought the story to life and tells him: “In the song, I was saying, ‘You want to be seen and I see you.’ It’s a love letter to you.” Which is a pretty good summary of the film.Steve is in cinemas now and on Netflix from 3 OctoberExplore more on these topicsFilmCillian MurphyMax PorterMenMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In Joe Orton’s 1964 treacle-dark comedy, greed and desire form a nasty compact.Sloane – no first name – is sizing up Kath’s spare room. Jordan Stephens (of hip-hop duo Rizzle Kicks) gives the mysterious stranger a bold, open smile, and Tamzin Outhwaite’s Kath blinks like a moth to flame. “You have the air of lost wealth,” she breathes, running what she insists is a motherly leg up his calf. She’s soon straddling him on the chaise (“I shall be so ashamed in the morning”), and when brother Ed arrives it’s clear Sloane will similarly wriggle like an eel into his affections.Orton’s first full-length play announced a distinctive voice: highly polished speech and murky behaviour. Orton, who cut a swathe through the public conveniences of north London, knew that sex was the body’s unbeatable trump card. His dialogue is a tightrope of propriety quivering above the lewd, every step an innuendo.Set designer Peter McKintosh’s in-the-round stage is a neat circle of chintz lapped by filth. Above hangs a collage of coal-black domestic objects (pram, cot, birdcage), a happy family home blown apart.

Was he the man who brought jazz to British folk as a founder of Pentangle, as a collaborator with John Martyn, with Nick Drake, with June Tabor, the Incredible String Band and more? Was he the bringer of class to the mainstream, recording with Cliff Richard, Johnny HatesJazz, Rod Stewart, T-Rex and others? Was he the elder adding gravitas to the recordings of younger pop experimentalists and formalists: ABC, Everything But the Girl, Graham Coxon, the The, David Sylvian, Kate Bush and Talk Talk?Danny Thompson was all of those things because he was always Danny Thompson. Artists worked with him not so they could have someone hold down a root note in 4/4 on an electric bass; they hired him to be Danny Thompson. And Danny Thompson was extraordinary: a man who played the upright double bass as if it were a lead instrument, who may have been an accompanist but who was never a sideman. Whoever he played with and whatever he was playing, he sounded like himself.Thompson, who has died at the age of 86, was a bass player from the beginning. He made his first bass from a tea chest when he was 13, using stolen piano wire for strings and fitting a hinged neck so he could fold it to catch the bus. By 16 he was playing in Soho clubs, and after his two years’ national service he went on tour playing electric bass for Roy Orbison – the only time he ever played electric bass.Although his first recording was with Alexis Korner’s Blues Incorporated, on the album Red Hot from Alex in 1964, unlike so many young musicians of the British blues boom he was no purist: playing was his job. He loved both jazz and folk, and Soho in the mid-60s gave him an ideal chance to straddle the two scenes. His freewheeling, melodic, propulsive style was an accident: he simply didn’t have an ear for root notes, so his fingers went where his ears led him.Pentangle – Hunting Song (in concert, 1971)With Pentangle, which he founded with Jacqui McShee, John Renbourn, Bert Jansch and Terry Cox, he helped revolutionise British folk music. If Folk, Blues & Beyond, the 1965 album by Davy Graham on which Thompson played, had shown that folk’s limits could be pushed, Pentangle exploded them: a group of virtuosos fascinated by the traditional repertoire but with no care for blind respect of tradition.Folk purists condemned Pentangle – and their contemporaries Fairport Convention – for what they perceived as a bastardisation of the songs preserved by Cecil Sharp, Francis Child and the other folk song collectors of the Victorian and Edwardian eras. But what Pentangle and Fairport did with folk songs was revolutionary: they returned them to their original state of being ever-evolving. And by crossing folk with jazz and with psychedelia and with blues, Pentangle provided a version for their own times, and one that still sounds remarkable today.View image in fullscreenPentangle’s Danny Thompson, Bert Jansch, Terry Cox, Jacqui McShee and John RenbournPhotograph: Brian Shuel/RedfernsDuring the Pentangle years, Thompson became known as what he would later call “a bit of a raver”. It didn’t stop him becoming a hugely productive and in-demand session player, especially with John Martyn, though the fact of his closeness with Martyn reflected the raving. The two of them formed what the writer Mark Cooper called “a notorious double act as they slurred their way between sentimental tenderness and barely camouflaged rage”.By 1976, Thompson was telling Karl Dallas in Melody Maker that the phone wasn’t ringing as much as it used to. “I’m thought of as a wild animal at the moment, but that’s my nature, innit? So they wanted to calm me down and become an introvert, which would have fazed everybody, I think, if they’d seen me walking around like an introvert.”John Martyn ft Danny Thompson – I don’t want to know about evil (Transatlantic sessions, 1996)The following year, he confronted his alcoholism, but it took until the 80s for the phone to start ringing again – it was Donovan who called first, but then the new generation started getting him in for sessions. He played on The Dreaming and Hounds of Love for Kate Bush. But they didn’t have to be high-end jobs: he played on Shelleyan Orphan’s debut album, Helleborine, because he was so tickled by the love for Nick Drake shown by the band.It wasn’t until 1987 that he released his first album under his own name: Whatever. In it you could hear the threads of Thompson’s musical life pulled together to his own design – melody lines from English folk played as if by a man from New Orleans. And while he played plenty of sessions, he was by now a name in his own right and his name started appearing alongside others on album covers – Richard Thompson, Eric Bibb.It was entirely fitting that the last record with his name on it was so true to character. First, it was plainly a job. Second, it reunited him with Pentangle’s Jacqui McShee. Third, it was not at all what one might have expected, even if it was completely true to his interests: Song of Joy for Christmas – An Album of Christmas Carols.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockFolk musicJazzcommentShareReuse this content"

Discussions range from the philosophical: “What do you value more – kindness or intelligence?” to cultural lore: “Have you watched The Princess Diaries?”View image in fullscreenIstha performs First Trimester in Dublin, Ireland: ‘When we did the show in Dublin, it didn’t matter what the question was – it always led back to their grandma, which I thought was really sweet.’Photograph: Szymon LazewskiOn their very first date seven years ago, Istha told their partner, Logan Rea, that they wanted to have children. The couple started looking into donor sperm properly four years ago, in the UK, Australia and Aotearoa (New Zealand), where Rea was born. It’s worth noting that the number of sperm donors is relatively small, which also means it’s predominantly white.“We were looking through sperm banks and we didn’t really connect with people from the information we were given,” Istha says. “In the UK every sperm bank had eye colour, height, PhD or no PhD. I was like, I don’t know how to pick someone from this information. I thought we could speak to lots of people and find whoever this ideal person is.”Why trans art matters more than ever: ‘It reflects how people live and love’Read moreNoticing what was missing in their search led to the creation of First Trimester, which has been staged in London, Copenhagen, Dublin, Switzerland and Auckland so far. (There’s even a Netflix documentary,Sperm Donors Wanted!, directed by Rea.) As the show has moved around the world, Istha has observed distinct values held by the prospective donors in each country.“When we did the show in Dublin, it didn’t matter what the question was – it always led back to their grandma, which I thought was really sweet,” they say. “In Switzerland, there was a real emphasis on people raising kids in co-ops, which I was very surprised by. It’s interesting to work out what people’s landscape of family making and ideas of family are.”When we speak on Zoom – Istha in London and me in regional Victoria – I’ve just apologetically exited the mayhem of post-Taco Tuesday cleanup with my wife and our own donor-conceived children. Having a known donor was important to us; we understand family to be both logical and biological, as it is for many members of the LGBTIQA+ community.My partner definitely said no to it at the start – now he’s completely on board and he loves it.Krishna IsthaWhen my wife, our donor and I met up in a cafe all those years ago, we asked him what would happen if he suddenly felt a desire to be an involved parent once a child was born. His honest response, that he genuinely didn’t know, confirmed he was the right person for us. We didn’t know until talking it through as a trio that humility was one of the qualities we were looking for.For both Istha and Rea, it feels essential to know the person who would be part of their lives – either now or when their child turns 18. And a face-to-face conversation will hopefully ensure their donor is not “a horrible person who is a transphobe or a queerphobe”.So First Trimester is a genuine search for a donor – but for the audience, it is also an eye-opening show about trans reproductive healthcare that puts conversations often held behind closed doors on stage. Istha explores the intersections of fertility and human connection with warmth and charisma, welcoming people to explore the myriad layers of this living artwork together.View image in fullscreenIstha and Rea are looking for a donor who is ‘kind and fun, who would add to the child’s life in some way’.Photograph: Jordon Rossi and Emily DrakeFor Istha and Rea, their initial conversations about seeking their donor through theatre were more whimsical wondering than concrete plan. Rea was initially worried about their privacy. “[He] definitely said no to it at the start,” says Istha. “Now he’s completely on board and he loves it – he sits in the audience for every show.”Part of why Rea changed his mind is also why First Trimester is so important. “As we spent more time looking into how trans people might go about having kids – adoption v carrying, the logistics, and the legal landscape of how we might be protected as parents – we almost immediately realised the lack of adequate information to help us through it,” Istha says. “We, of course, were very lucky to have queer friends and family who have done this before and had access to information that way, but the thing that made Logan go ‘yes we should do this show’ was wanting to create resources for others in the future.”The generosity of the LGBTIQA+ community flows in many directions, and responses to the show have been no exception. “Our friends have offered [to donate sperm] way more than they would have otherwise,” says Istha. “But we did set a rule, because I am a performance artist: if you offer [a donation], you have to be in the show. It’s unfair to set up a process and then not stick to it.”In broad terms, Istha and Rea’s ideal donor would be “someone we can get on with, someone we would want in our lives as a friend forever after that point”.“It’s much like looking for a partner – good communication, and to believe in the same thing,” they add. “Someone kind and fun who would add to the child’s life in some way.”In their dreams, what does Istha’s future family look like? “The first thing that pops into my head is matching outfits,” they reply. “Me and Logan and this baby in some sort of incredible silver onesie. The first dream is to have a child. I’ll dream about the rest if and when that happens.”First Trimester is on at Arts House,North Melbourne, 16-18 October.

Director Emily Burns puts these strongmen in slick modern-day suits to hammer it home and the parallel becomes all the clearer in Frankie Bradshaw’s set which resembles a political battlefield of glass, chrome and parliamentary green. But the production also lays bare how puritanical morality and religion are weaponised by politicians in ways that seems utterly applicable to the machinations of the right wing today.An opening screen montage designed by Zakk Hein includes leaders whose reigns have been rocked by sex scandals (such as Bill Clinton and Donald Trump) as well as images of Jeffrey Epstein and Prince Andrew. What is ingenious, and counterintuitive, is that the villainous Angelo (Tom Mothersdale) is still made human. Outwardly he has an accountant’s dead-eyed way, following his morality laws to the letter by sentencing Claudio (Oli Higginson) on a technicality: he is waiting for dowry matters to be resolved when he is caught in flagrante with his wife-to-be, Juliet (Miya James). But when Angelo proposes to Claudio’s sister, Isabella (Isis Hainsworth), that he spare her brother’s life in exchange for her virginity – effectively blackmailing her for sex – he is shown to be tormented by his desire. You are repelled by his bald hypocrisy but understand it arises from weakness.View image in fullscreenDoubt cast … Isis Hainsworth and Adam James.Photograph: Helen Murray/c/o RSCWhat also seems so modern in the production is the doubt cast on women’s testimonies. “Who will believe thee?” Angelo says, when she threatens him with exposure, knowing the world will take his word over hers. Recent plays such asRed Like FruitandPrima Facieillustrate this fact, and it is truly horrifying that Angelo’s words ring so true today.This razor-sharp production has crisp, clear direction. A major high-wire edit is made by Burns who cuts the entire subplot involving Elbow, Mistress Overdone and co. It becomes a solemn play, with no distraction or light relief from the central storyline, but that works in its favour, with tension and dread turned up and up. Single notes of music (composed by Asaf Zohar) recur and spotlights heighten them further (lighting design by Joshua Pharo), along with unexpected use of Elvis Presley’s Can’t Help Falling in Love to accompany the vital bedroom swap between Isabella and Mariana (Emily Benjamin). The sex is made explicit and surprising in its power games.Even in spite of the excision of the more comic scenes, the production manages to wring out humour from certain lines spoken by these men, for their hypocrisies: Angelo’s shame at the end is both terrible and ridiculous as he tries to hide himself under his jacket like a naughty schoolboy, while Lucio (Douggie McMeekin)’s attention-seeking interruptions – and lies – during Duke Vincentio’s returning speech are laughable.Each performer brings fullness to their part, with crystalline verse delivery. Every inflection of Adam James’s Duke resembles that of a power-playing politician. Hainsworth, as Isabella, begins as the wide-eyed novice nun – a kind of Christian Dorothy of Oz with her gingham dress and scrubbed-face sense of right and wrong – but reveals steel and anger to become a mighty force. Benjamin’s hard-faced Mariana is another highlight but it is Mothersdale who soars the highest in making Angelo both appalling and human.The women’s testimonies dotriumph over Angelo’s in the end albeit with the vital help of the Duke. This production navigates his queasy marriage proposal to Isabella, which usually carries the sense of yet more sexual coercion, with an open-endedness that is more satisfactory for our times – and possibility brings Isabella her much-earned liberation.AtRoyal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 25 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreRoyal Shakespeare CompanyMeasure for MeasurereviewsShareReuse this content"

But Cardinale perhaps had something her contemporaries didn’t: a kind of simplicity and frankness to go with the sensual allure. She often played opposite Alain Delon, whose own beauty complemented – almost merged with – hers.In Visconti’s early masterpiece Rocco and His Brothers from 1960, Cardinale played Ginetta, engaged to one of Rocco’s brothers from the uncouth south and her parents are openly hostile when their son-in-law’s entire family make their chaotic appearance. She was radiant in Luchino Visconti’sThe Leopardin 1963, as wealthy merchant’s daughter Angelica on whom Burt Lancaster’s Prince bestows his frank admiration even as she is engaged to his nephew Tancredi, played by Delon. In the famed final ball sequence, she plays her part by inviting Lancaster’s ageing lion to dance, and perhaps also to offer him an elegant symbolic exit from his own prestige.View image in fullscreen‘Ideal woman’ … in Fellini’s 8½.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyOther auteurs gave her significant roles – Alberto Cavalcanti gave her a part in his 1959 romantic comedy Venetian Honeymoon with Vittorio De Sica and Abel Gance cast her as Napoleon’s sister Pauline in Austerlitz in 1960 – but the most pivotal moment of Cardinale’s early career was to be cast byFederico Fellini in his cinephile meta comedy 8½. She played the up-and-coming screen star whom Marcello Mastroianni’s creatively blocked movie director impulsively decides is his ideal woman who must redeem his emotionally wrecked leading character – but who tells him this figure is incapable of real love. It is perhaps a subconscious, subtextual joke in 8½ that her surname riffs on cardinal importance, cardinal truth and religious authority. She also scored a hit in an authentic leading role in Girl With a Suitcase from 1961, directed by Valerio Zurlini, in which Cardinale played a young woman with the Verdi-esque name of Aida, who survives on the unreliable attentions of many different sorts of besotted men.Claudia Cardinale: a life in picturesRead moreHollywood didn’t entirely do Cardinale justice, making her an international star chiefly for being the sozzled, glamorous princess who owns the titular jewel in The Pink Panther, one of many cast-members destined to be upstaged by Peter Sellers’s Inspector Clouseau. She also lent her charm to many generic war pictures, her Italianate image being often considered appropriate to this kind of material, but the most important was Sergio Leone’s widescreen westernOnce Upon a Time in the Westfrom 1968, personifying the movie’s Italo-Hollywood fusion as former sex worker Jill, the tough woman with a past and the owner of a ranch that others want to destroy. Werner Herzog was later to give her the not entirely dissimilar part of brothel madame in his 1982 picture Fitzcarraldo.Back inItaly, she was paired with her country’s legends: playing opposite Franco Nero in the mafia drama The Day of the Owl in 1968, and with Alberto Sordi in the mail order bride comedy A Girl in Australia, in which Cardinale had a reformed tart-with-a-heart role. Another award-winning role was her portrayal of Benito Mussolini’s mistress in Claretta in 1984, directed by her partner Pasquale Squitieri.Cardinale was an amazing, vivid presence – and an icon of Italian and Hollywood cinema.This article was amended on 24 September 2025.

The alt-pop star explains why she’s still so fired upWed 24 Sep 2025 10.01 EDTShareIt’s 11 years since Sarah McLachlan last released an album of original songs. The break had worried her. “What do I have to say at this point in my life?” she says. “I’m a 57-year-old white woman of privilege. Does anybody want to hear from me?”Looking tanned and relaxed on an early morning video call from Vancouver Island, the Nova Scotia native admits she had “stayed busy”: she released a Christmas album (2016’s Wonderland) and worked as the principal fundraiser and founding board chair for her three namesake music schools, which provide lessons and education to at-risk youth. At the same time, she was a self-proclaimed dance mom raising two daughters; the second recently went off to college. But there was still “trepidation around being out of the game for so long”.McLachlan, though, has never been one for reticence. In the 1990s, with her otherworldly voice and knack for cathartic lyrics, the three-time Grammy winner was part of a galvanising movement of bold female singer-songwriters, from Alanis Morissette to Fiona Apple and Indigo Girls. Her US breakthrough, 1994’s Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, contained the haunting single Possession,based on obsessive fan lettersshe received.Several years later, she founded Lilith Fair, a revolutionary all-female artists festival that upended the music industry’s gendered power dynamics. At this week’s premiere of a documentary about the festival, Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery, McLachlan castigated the “insidious erosion of women’s rights, of trans and queer rights.” A subsidiary of Disney is distributing the documentary, and Disney’s temporary suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s talk show over his comments about Charlie Kirk prompted McLachlan to refuse to give a previously announced live performance “in solidarity in support of free speech”. On his return to TV this week (23 September), McLachlan was his musical guest.View image in fullscreenSarah McLachlan performs at the Lilith Fair at Shoreline Amphitheatre, California, in 1999.Photograph: Tim Mosenfelder/Getty ImagesMcLachlan’s honesty and willingness to subvert the status quo inspire intense devotion. Feist, Allison Russell and Muna’s Katie Gavin (who appears on Better Broken’s Reminds Me) are avowed fans. (You may not be aware of your own devotion: she sang the gutting When She Loved Me from Toy Story 2.) The rapturous response to a recent anniversary tour where she performed Fumbling Towards Ecstasy in full was “overwhelming”, she says. “I had no idea that many people had such an attachment to that record. Everybody I got to talk to about it was like, ‘Oh my God – this record got me through my first year of university.’”In recent years, McLachlan started trying to work out her next musical steps. She scrapped a bunch of songs, but found her direction with Rise, a song about embracing community when facing political headwinds. She wrote One in a Long Line, a steely response to the erosion of women’s rights and the overturning of Roe v Wade. “That song is about being mad,” she says with a laugh. “And upset, and going, ‘What the fuck is going on?’ I’ve never been overtly political. But I feel like this is a time where I have a platform, and whether I alienate fans or not, I feel like I need to make a stand.”Sarah McLachlan: Remind Me (ft Katie Gavin) – videoThe song acknowledges the generations of women who “foughtsohard to put [things] into place so that we would have agency over our own bodies,” she says. “To see that being taken away – and to see this idea that we should be back to being barefoot in the kitchen serving our men – is terrifying and enraging.” But she wanted to channel anger into action and interrogate the roots of these attitudes – “Is it just fear? Is it control?” – in order to “figure out a way forward” for future generations. To underscore this point, her two daughters add poignant backing vocals. “Because it is more about them than it is about me,” says McLachlan. “It’s about the generations coming forward and what we’re creating for them and what the world’s going to look like.”Growing up in Halifax, Nova Scotia, McLachlan first took ukulele lessons from a neighbour and later studied classical guitar and piano at a conservatory. “It was never the kind of music that I was that interested in, but it was a means to learn the instruments,” she says. “So I stuck with it.” She preferred listening to her mother’s folk records (Cat Stevens, Joan Baez, Simon and Garfunkel) and soon gravitated toward more progressive music. Genesis’s 1974 LP The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway was “a seminal record” – she gave one of her daughters the middle name Rael, the album’s main character – while Peter Gabriel, Cocteau Twins and Kate Bush became influential touchstones.At 19, after being spotted fronting her short-lived band the October Game, McLachlan signed with the Canadian indie label Nettwerk Records. They gave her “autonomy” and “full creative control” over her work. “Which is amazing,” she says. “I had no idea how lucky I was.”Missy Elliott, Lilith Fair 1998: a sensational burst of black fantasyRead moreThese halcyon days were short-lived. When she started promoting her music to radio in the 1990s, stations told McLachlan her single couldn’t be playlisted because another female artist had already been added that week, or that they couldn’t play two women back to back. Naturally, that didn’t apply to male artists. “It just seems so asinine to me,” she says. “As a music fan, I would just listen to music. I wouldn’t even think, ‘Is it a guy or a girl?’”Determined to prove the narrow-minded gatekeepers wrong, McLachlan booked a handful of all-female concerts in summer 1996. These shows sold out; buoyed by the enthusiasm, she started Lilith Fair the following year. The touring festival featured a rotating multi-stage lineup packed with mainstream and underground artists – the first year included Fiona Apple, Suzanne Vega, Tracy Chapman, Emmylou Harris and Sheryl Crow – and benefited local women’s charities.Promoters and radio employees were sceptical, she says, telling her: “People won’t come if you put more than two women on stage together.” But the tour became a phenomenon – and fringed with anti-abortion protesters and threats of violence. She held exhausting daily press conferences before each date, fielding questions that forced her to defend the tour’s very existence: “‘Why are you doing this? Why do you hate men?’ And I’m like, ‘What does celebrating women have to do with hating men?’” The constant pushback was “surprising and shocking to me at the beginning”, she says now. “And it wore me down a little bit, because I’m like, ‘You want to rip this thing apart, and you probably haven’t even come to see it.’”View image in fullscreen‘What does celebrating women have to do with hating men?’ … at Neil Young’s Annual Bridge Benefit in 1998.Photograph: Tim Mosenfelder/GettyLilith Fair raised McLachlan’s profile considerably. “I was playing to probably 3,000 people before I did Lilith,” she says. “And all of a sudden I was playing to 15, 18, 20,000. My audience exploded, and all the other [Lilith] artists’ audiences exploded as well.” By the end of the third and final Lilith Fair in 1999, McLachlan was itching to make new music, but found it increasingly difficult to balance overseeing the festival with songwriting. Musical trends had also shifted, with alt-rock earnestness replaced by regressive nu-metal and glossy pop.‘If men couldn’t have sex with me, they didn’t know what to do with me’: Alanis Morissette on addiction, midlife liberation and the predatory 90sRead moreShe enjoyed a massive UK hit in 2000 with dance remixes of Silence, a collaboration with her then-labelmates, the ambient electronic group Delerium, but over the next decade her commercial fortunes cooled. A 2010 Lilith Fair revival was marred by lacklustre crowds, negative headlines and financial woes.But today, momentum is on McLachlan’s side. Silence became a perennial summer dance staple. “A friend texted me last night from Burning Man,” she says. “It’s like, ‘Here’s your song with [DJ] John Summit.’ It’s had legs.”That long-awaited documentary on Lilith Fair alsopremieres this month. The film deftly illustrates the festival’s radical joy by juxtaposing new commentary from McLachlan and other artists (Jewel, Liz Phair, Indigo Girls, Paula Cole) with archival news, performance and interview clips. The artists come across as principled and full of integrity despite facing frankly horrifying sexism and misogyny; the artistic community that sprang up around Lilith Fair was clearly an oasis from this treatment.During filming, McLachlan re-read her diaries from this era and was struck by the juxtaposition of creative euphoria and operational stress: “So-and-so is not showing up. We’ve got a bomb threat.” She was gratified that the film itself captures the positivity of the tour. “I really got a sense of the joy, the exhilaration of meeting all these artists, of getting to perform with them, of getting to create bonds and friendships and this community that wasn’t competitive,” she says. “[It was] a safe space for us as artists, a safe space for the audience.”Many younger artists have called for the return of Lilith Fair, but McLachlan is ambivalent – and content to let those acts evolve her legacy. “It was all-encompassing, overwhelming,” she says. “And we did it – I already did it – so now I don’t want to do it again. Someone else can take the flame.”Better Broken is out now on Concord.

I also cannot ignore how this has been handled in the press. Not only was the story completely false but the language used by the Daily Mail has been deliberately inflammatory, crafted purely for clickbait, clearly designed to fuel online division.“It is always Free Palestine but exploiting a global tragedy in order to sell newspapers is something I find deeply troubling.”In its own statement, William Morris Endeavour said: “Reports suggesting that Dua Lipa or her management dismissed one of our agents because of his political views are categorically false.“David Levy played a role in Dua’s early career (2016-2019) and as is customary, is credited both internally and in industry journals as being a member of the team. When he moved out of London in 2019, he transitioned into an advisory role and has not been involved in Dua’s day-to-day business since. Levy fully removed himself from the project among others earlier this year.”The letter, whoseexistence was initially publicised by DJ Toddla T, came after Kneecap’s Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh wascharged with a terrorism offencefor allegedly displaying a flag in support of the proscribed organisation Hezbollah at a 2024 gig.Ó hAnnaidh has denied the allegations and said that the flag was thrown on stage and he picked it up without seeing what it was. His next court hearing is set for 26 September, during which a chief magistrate is expected to decide whether he will stand trial.Lipa is one of the few pop stars of her calibre to speak openly about the conflict in Gaza. She has repeatedly called for a ceasefire and in May posted on Instagram: “Burning children alive can never be justified. The whole world is mobilising to stop the Israeli genocide. Please show your solidarity with Gaza.” She has also joined calls for the UK to stop selling arms toIsrael.Explore more on these topicsMusicDua LipaMusic industryGlastonbury 2025Glastonbury festivalKneecapIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

Wow,” Osman said in response. “I assumed he was never going to die. This is terrible news.”Herron said that he figured out the character’s fate “relatively recently”. Asked what that moment was like, the author said that “like most plot elements, it was just solving a problem, I thought ‘Oh, that’s how that could be done’”.The fifth season of the Apple TV+ adaptation, starringGary Oldmanas Jackson Lamb, begins streaming today. The ninth full-length novel in the Slough House series, Clown Town, was published earlier this month.Osman, meanwhile, will publish a new book in the Thursday Murder Club series, The Impossible Fortune, this week. The first book in the series, which is about a group of residents from a retirement facility who band together to solve crimes, wasadapted for film and released last month.Osman’s series “has an awful lot in common” with Slough House in the sense that it’s about “a group of people who were high-powered and now find themselves sidelined”, said Osman. Underdogs “are incredibly useful to write about”.Osman said he sees the adaptation – which stars Helen Mirren, Pierce Brosnan, Ben Kingsley and Celia Imrie – as a “grandchild rather than a child”.“When you watch something, you think, ‘Oh I would have done that differently’, but I would have done everything differently, and my version would have been so long and boring,” said Osman.The author added that he knew in advance that Imrie was lined up to appear on The Celebrity Traitors that airs in October as he was asked by the production team whether she “would be good”, to which he responded that she would be “unbelievably good”.Slow Horses season five review – not even Gary Oldman can salvage this TV messRead moreOsman said he is 4,000 words in to a follow-up to We Solve Murders. “Mick will tell you that’s about the worst place you can be as a writer. Better to be zero words in or 80,000 words. Oh my God it’s a nightmare. How am I ever going to finish it? It seems an impossibility.” The second book will be set in Italy, and should be out next September.Talking about how he solves plot problems, Herron said: “There comes a point when you’re aware that this has happened before, and you got out of it then, and it will all be OK, you just allow the back part of your brain to do the work.” He will sometimes write down problems and “just go and do something else, and at some point – 24, 48, 72 hours later – the answer just pops into your head”.Osman and Herron also discussed their respective cats. Osman’s cat Lottie walks on the keyboard while he’s writing – in one instance deleting a paragraph of a novel. Meanwhile, Herron said his cat, Tommy, “helps me write emails”.Clown Town by Mick Herron (John Murray Press, £22). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

A collection of her possessions, includingChandler’s typewriterand a number of poems and private letters he had written, wassold at auctionin New York in December.Gulli has previously uncovered lost, unknown or rarely seen creations from a range of prominent writers includingGraham Greene,Truman Capote,HG WellsandChandler, the Chicago-born, British-American author of classics such as The Big Sleep; Farewell, My Lovely; The Lady in the Lake; and The Long Goodbye. Chandler died in 1959 aged 70.The personal story also features Chandler’s wife, Cissy, who, according to Gulli, said she thought Nightmare was “very funny”. It means the story was written prior to her December 1954 death, but dating it precisely gets “tricky” beyond that, he said.More notable, he said, was that the content of the short story, which Chandler probably never intended to be published. It suggests he might not have been as confident in his writing and self-promotion abilities as he liked to present.“The most revealing line in Nightmare is Chandler’s aside: ‘It will remind me of the days when I used to get returned manuscripts,’” Chandler biographer Tom Williams said.“Chandler loved to mythologize his own life. In 1933 he told his friend William Lever that ‘I sold the very first story I sent out’. This was Blackmailers Don’t Shoot, published inBlack Maskin December that year.“Nightmare casts doubt over this. Did he submit stories to Black Mask before Blackmailers Don’t Shoot that were turned down? Or was he thinking back to his first literary ambitions in London, or to the years after the [first world] war when he worked in the oil industry?”Williams said it was “entirely plausible” that Chandler, who lived in London between 1900 and 1912 and became a British subject before returning to the US, had struggled to sell his writings before turning to full-time crime writing in the early 1930s after losing a job in the oil industry.“Whatever the precise context, Nightmare complicates the neat origin story Chandler liked to tell,” he said.“It hints at a different and less successful literary trajectory. For all his efforts to make himself seem self-invented, Chandler remained, even to himself, his greatest mystery.”Sarah Trott, a UK-based author of the Chandler biographyWar Noir, said the discovery of the story, among other authenticated papers in the Vounder-Davis collection including love letters to Cissy, helped expose an “incredibly sentimental” side to him.“The publication of anything new by Chandler only makes him an even more multi-faceted writer. The more we uncover, the more complex he becomes,” she said.“Whether it’s his crime novels, his short stories or poetry, Chandler was a writer undoubtedly concerned by the human condition and many of the stories and vignettes uncovered over the past few years highlight just how he sought to understand human foibles, experience, and emotions.“Nightmare is interesting because on the surface it appears as a nightmare scenario, a man accused of a heinous crime that he can’t remember committing. The final bracketed sentence feels as though this is simply an account of a horrible dream, a literal nightmare.“Yet the mention of Cissy, Chandler’s wife of 37 years, suggests this nightmare was an even more personal connection for the writer: the horror of rejection by publishers. We get to see the real Chandler … It feels more personal and intimate than the Marlowe novels.”Explore more on these topicsRaymond ChandlerMagazinesNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

It follows the journey of a young couple who move to the countryside and encounter mysterious and grotesque changes to their bodies.In one scene, which features a wedding between two men, one of the men’s faces was altered to look like a woman’s. Cinemagoers in China only noticed the change when side-by-side screenshots of the scene circulated on social media.“AI face-swapping is really unacceptable – it completely changes the original creative vision,” wrote one social media user.Films have to be approved by China’s censorship authorities to be released on the mainland. For imported films, this often leads to scenes featuring themes that the government deems sensitive or racy being cut. But the use of technology to alter scenes rather than just cut them is relatively new. Some viewers complained that it made the censorship harder to spot.UK academics studying topics sensitive to China face harassment, survey findsRead more“What’s happening outside the film is even more terrifying than what’s shown in it,” wrote one Weibo user.Homosexuality is decriminalised in China but it is still widely stigmatised, with nuclear, heterosexual relationships promoted as the ideal norm. The government’s longstanding stance of “neither supporting nor opposing” homosexuality has given way inrecent yearsto acrackdownon LGBTQ+ groups. It is very rare to see same-sex relationships in mainstream films or television shows. In 2021, China’s television regulatorbanned“sissy men” from appearing on screen.But public opinion is increasingly supportive of LGBTQ identities. A survey published last year found that just over half of peopleagreedthat LGBTQ people should be accepted by Chinese society.View image in fullscreenTogether’s general release in China has not yet gone ahead because of the backlash to the change.Photograph: NeonOne user on RedNote said that the use of AI to gender-swap gay characters was “humiliating minority groups”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yikes!Hannah J DaviesWed 24 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTShareThe fifth season ofSlow Horsesstarts with a timely sequence: a gun attack perpetrated by a follower of a far-right politician (we even briefly glimpse a few St George’s crosses). Rightwing politics is an area that Apple TV+’s spy drama has tackled before; back in season one, a British-Pakistani student was memorably taken on a joyride by a nationalist group named Sons of Albion, who threatened to behead him on a live stream.However, like many things in the Slow Horses universe – based onMick Herron’s bestselling novels about a group of MI5 rejects – the opening proves something of a red herring. Season five isn’t really about white nationalists, or environmental activists, or hostile foreign actors, and yet it is also about all of those things, all at once. As a result, it is overstuffed and strangely lacking in substance.Worse still, people-pleasing agent River Cartwright (Jack Lowden) has undergone a personality bypass, and spends much of the series acting in a way that can only be described as unnervingly dickish. (Lowden pulls it off, but it does feel rather unbecoming for the show’s unofficial hero.) Still, it figures: as well as observing his grandfather David’s rapid descent into dementia, last season saw River discover that his real dad was an ex-CIA agent turned cult leader, who had impregnated multiple women in an attempt to raise a cabal of future assassins. Yikes.View image in fullscreenRather unbecoming for our hero … so River Cartwright is a baddie now?Photograph: Apple TV+Season five, then, is centred on the fallout of that aforementioned attack, and – somewhat separately – the possibility that Roddy Ho’s (Christopher Chung) new girlfriend is using him to get her hands on classified intelligence. Chung is more cringe-inducing and more pitiful than ever as the computer whiz who is convinced that his new squeeze couldn’t have possibly been a spy (after all, as he says, he doesn’t pay for sex, “sex pays forme!”). He’s got a purple man-bun and Prodigy-style dance moves now, too, which only makes the pathos more pronounced when it does arrive.View image in fullscreenMore cringe-inducing than ever … Roddy Ho.Photograph: Apple TV+Gary Oldman, of course, remains the reluctant leader of the pack as Slough House boss Jackson Lamb. Aimee-Ffion Edwards returns as Shirley, who has developed PTSD on top of her drug addiction, but is still as deliciously acerbic as ever (she describes Lamb’s notorious flatulence as smelling as though there’s “a pauper’s grave in your arsehole”).‘Directors would be like – this is the Asian part’: Slow Horses’ Christopher Chung on battling to become a leading manRead moreThe death of Marcus (Kadiff Kirwan) last season has robbed the show of its second-best double act, after the death of Min (Dustin Demri-Burns) robbed the show of its first-best double act, with Louisa (Rosalind Eleazar). (We tragically lose her, too, as she takes a much-needed mental health break from Slough House – although not before an excellently bad leaving party, catered by River with Tesco’s best snacks.) This series is now largely devoid of duos, which may be where it goes wrong. Still, it would have been more awkward to force something substantial between any of these asocial characters – not least Coe (Tom Brooke), who remains more discomfiting than most of the bad guys.View image in fullscreenThe worst ever leaving party? … the Slough House crew say goodbye to Louisa.Photograph: Jack English/Apple TV+The main problem here, though, is that the plot pinballs around far too much, and far too frivolously. In previous series, the enemy – the Russians, rogue ex-MI5 agents – has been identified early and given plenty of screen time. Here, a terrorist plot battles for relevance with meditations on “incel” culture and the environment; a blackmail threat against spineless service head Claude Whelan (James Callis); and a brief will-they-won’t-they between two characters that adds absolutely nothing to proceedings. Meanwhile, Nick Mohammed plays the platitude-heavy London mayor, Zafar Jaffrey, for about five minutes, and Diana Taverner (Kristin Scott Thomas) has nothing to do apart from frown and drink large amounts of wine.It is possible that someone somewhere decided there had been too many foreign dalliances, and was worried about either the budget or the climate impact.But having watched a scene set entirely at London zoo’s penguin enclosure, I can’t help but feel that the amount of CO2emissions expended by the series is proportional to its dramatic chops.There is, naturally, a late twist: no new paternity test results for River, sadly, but something that does change the mood of the series. But, really, it comes too late to salvage the thing. The sound editing at the end of episode five is really, really good. But the fact that I am so intensely taken by what I am listening to and not what I am watching says it all.Slow Horses is on Apple TV+ nowExplore more on these topicsSlow HorsesTV reviewTelevisionGary OldmanKristin Scott ThomasreviewsShareReuse this content"

But the Third Reich did, in Mark Mazower’s judgment, “discredit antisemitism as a positive programme for decades to come”.It is an arresting turn of phrase that makes reckoning with the Holocaust after the second world war sound more like a trend in public policy than a moral imperative. But that is the point. Mazower, a professor of history at Columbia University, is talking about a particular manifestation of anti-Jewish sentiment that rose and fell in a relatively short time frame.The operative word, dissonant in the context of mass murder, is “positive”. People didn’t stop hating Jews after 1945, but they found there was an electoral penalty for boasting about it. The loud, proud style of antisemitism was banished from the mainstream.Mazower’s book contains many such distinctions – subtle twists of the lens that bring different shades of personal and ideological animus into focus. The underlying thesis is not controversial, at least not as historiography. Medieval massacres, Tsarist pogroms, industrialised slaughter by Nazis, Soviet persecutions and terrorist attacks on Israel all belong to a single category to the extent that Jews are identified as the victims. But they are also functions of diverse economic, religious and political contexts that, from the historian’s perspective, defy being summed up by a single word.Before you even get to the task of comparing motives for prejudice there is the problem of defining the target. Judaism is ancient, but Jewishness as an identity and, by extension, a set of attributes to be vilified, has evolved. Many of its current secular expressions would have been scarcely comprehensible to devout religious communities in premodern Europe. And yet, centuries-old rituals of faith are a strong pillar of cultural association even for atheist Jews today. Such are the paradoxes that Mazower grapples with in order to bring some precision to the meaning of antisemitism.The story begins with the coinage of the word in late 19th-century Germany. The concept is embossed with intellectual and political fixations of that place and time – the emergence of nationalism as an organising principle for European states and the accompanying pseudoscience of racial difference and hierarchy.For Mazower it is important to distinguish this relatively recent coalescence of anti-Jewish feeling as a driver of political activism from previous generations of animosity. He is especially critical of the tendency to treat antisemitism as a phenomenon as old as Judaism itself – the plotting of 20th-century atrocities on a continuum of hatred that reaches back to biblical narratives of exile, and further still to slavery under the pharaohs. His point is not to deny the long list of regimes and societies that have mistreated Jewish populations, but to resist the fatalism that conflates modern political phenomena with scriptural and liturgical tales of suffering and persecution.It is possible to express fury at the deaths of innocent civilians in Gaza without tilting into old conspiracy theoriesThis becomes especially important, and inevitably controversial, when Mazower’s timeline reaches the creation of modern Israel. Differentiating between modes of hostility to Jews before 1948 was a challenge. It becomes spectacularly difficult once the scene shifts to the Middle East.In 1920, the place most Jews called home was somewhere in Europe. By 1950, it was the US. Now it is Israel, where a radical nationalist government presents itself as the embodiment and only legitimate political expression of Jewish interests worldwide. That is an extreme reconfiguration of the original Zionist project. It is not a view shared by many diaspora Jews, nor indeed by liberal Israelis.Mazower strives to be systematic in setting out legitimate reasons for political opposition to the actions of the Israeli state and identifying the place where a certain ferocity of condemnation shades into antisemitism. It is possible to express fury at the deaths of civilians in Gaza without tilting into old conspiracy theories about Jews as a uniquely bloodthirsty global power elite. It is possible to demand justice for Palestinians without insisting on the annihilation of Israel.Crowds of Israelis who protest against Benjamin Netanyahu’s government manage it all the time. Plainly they aren’t all antisemites willing destruction on themselves and their country. That doesn’t mean the charge isn’t levelled against them by fanatical ultra-Zionists, who themselves sometimes aren’t even Jewish. There is a disturbing trend for white supremacists and Christian fundamentalists to adopt extreme pro-Israel stances because they see Gaza as the frontline in a civilisational struggle against Islam.As Mazower engages with these present-day arguments, his book takes less nuanced, more polemical and US-centric turns. His partisanship for the progressive side in a culture war being waged against US universities by Donald Trump’s administration is understandable, but it comes at a cost in relevance to readers in European countries, where the balance of political forces and arguments is different.But it surely asks too much that a book on this subject, at this inflection point in history, might illuminate all angles equally. For Mazower to provide any respite of clarity on a topic befogged in rage and confusion is achievement enough.On Antisemitism: A Word in History by Mark Mazower is published by Allen Lane (£25).

Asher Baum, anxious and hypochondriac, with two ex-wives, a handsome home in Connecticut and a pied-à-terre in Manhattan, finds himself having cocktails in Bemelmans Bar with an attractive young woman. Whatever shocks you might expect from this novel, the shock of the new isn’t one of them.Reading What’s With Baum? is an eerie, almost unearthly experience, like being taken to some secret Narnia part of New York where a new Neil Simon play is about to open, or a record store where you can check out a Burt Bacharach LP in the listening booth, or a TV studio where you can watch a live taping of the Dick Cavett Show, with Robert Wagner, Rex Reed and Gore Vidal. Allen’s mannerisms, his themes, his comedy – and there are some very good gags here – are just the same as they ever were. In fact, this novel is more fluent, more plausible on its own terms, than any of his recent movies – though it finally collapses into perfunctory and unresolved farcical silliness in a very familiar way.So: will Allen use the more confessional interior possibilities of the novel to address some of the controversy about him personally, such as the 1992 allegation of sexual assault made by his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow? Will he investigate the culture wars, which in his case flared up recently with a visit to theMoscow film festival? The answer is no, although it seems at first as if he might do all these things – as if, in fact, they are the whole point of his story.Asher Baum has recently given an interview promoting his latest book to a young Japanese-American journalist called Cindy Tanaka (or as Baum distractedly says: “Cindy Mindy Woo – the Chinese one whatever her name was”), on whose shoulders he afterwards placed his hands and to whom he gave a deeply misjudged and inappropriate kiss. Now Baum’s agent is on the phone warning him that the interviewer is outraged, that the piece is going to be a #MeToo takedown, and that Baum’s career – moribund in any case – is now finished.This novel is more fluent, more plausible on its own terms, than any of his recent moviesThe reader may be on tenterhooks to find out how Baum’s shruggingly ironic, nervily sardonic worldview is going to hold up in the middle of this imminent political storm – and, by that token, what it is like to be Woody Allen. But the storm never arrives. Cindy Tanaka never appears in her own person in the story, which effectively finishes before the article comes out.The point is rather to show Baum’s general comic unravelling, and the surfacing of all his neuroses. Like Herzog’s compulsive letter writing in Saul Bellow’s novel of the same name, Baum starts openly talking to himself, a jabbering dialogue of self-confrontation and self-exculpation. Subjects include his more successful businessman brother (whom he suspects of having had a fling with his third wife) and an intellectual mentor who, to Baum’s consternation, intends to abandon the life of the mind to play tambourine in a New Orleans jazz band called the White Chocolate Dandies.But most importantly there is Baum’s wife, Connie, and her insufferable son – and Baum’s stepson – Thane. Here is where the novel comes to life. As a kid, when Connie and Baum were first dating, Thane was an appalling brat. Now, while Baum’s career flounders, with nasty reviews and tanking sales, Thane suddenly becomes a literary superstar with a smash-hit novel called The Bevelled Heart. It’s a title that annoys the hell out of Baum, eaten up as he is with envious rage, having apparently become Salieri to this appalling young Mozart.There are plenty of nice lines along the way. Baum despises animals for being “failed humans”. He says the sexual signal “goes round and round endlessly, like radar” and that guilt is that “powerful enveloping element as prevalent as oxygen and perhaps just as necessary”. Poor Baum just has to keep working, like Sisyphus: “Does anyone give a damn that I’m pushing a rock up a hill? And if I ever get it up there, then what the hell have I got? A rock on a hill.” Baum, and his creator, are still pushing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But this excellent culture wars documentary tells the story of book-banning in red states such as Florida and Texas, where religious rightwingers are crusading to protect children from “obscene” books. Usually that means titles about LGBTQ+ issues or race, and books about girls getting their period aren’t safe either. In Tennessee, a school board banned Maus, the graphic novel memoir of the Holocaust by Art Spiegelman,for mouse nudity. The utter nonsense of it would be funny if it wasn’t so disturbing.The most recent purge began in 2021 witha list of 850 bookscirculated by Texas state representative Matt Krause (over 60% were books with LGBTQ+ themes). Rightwing Florida governor Ron DeSantis piled in, followed byMoms for Liberty, a rightwing parents’ rights group(don’t ask them about big dollar funders). Documentary maker Kim A Snyder and her editors cleverly work in footage of Nazi book burning and clips from classic movies and TV into their film.Out on the frontline, in school board meetings and public libraries, conservatives vent their outrage. In Granbury, Texas mum of nine Monica Brown believes her pastor should pick the books stocked in the library. Her gay son has other ideas. The heroes of the film are the librarians. Ordinarily, it would be tempting to insert a joke here. But these (mostly) women risk being fired from their jobs, and are routinely targeted with hateful vitriol. “Pornographer!” “Paedophile!” yells one man at a meeting, blood vessels popping. Another guy brings along a firearm: “I know where you live.” Incredibly principled and brave, the librarians talk about their vocation and standing up for the young people for whom libraries are a safe space where they can discover their identity in the pages of books. They really are superwomen.The Librarians is out on 26 September in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsLibrariesCensorshipreviewsShareReuse this content"

Predictably, the result is a bit of a mess, but there are redeeming features that make it much more watchable than many early reports might have suggested.For instance, the film contains arguably Bill Murray’s best semi-dramatic performance in years, on a par with his melancholy, haunted and yet still droll-dry turns in Rushmore and Lost in Translation. Here he plays Leftie, an east coast mobster, once a bit of a capo but now semi-retired ever since he handed over the reins of the family business to his son Johnnie (Michael Angelo Covino). Something explained only later has brought Leftie back into the killing people business, with assistance from nerdy murderer-in-training Lonnie (Pete Davidson). The two of them are heading up to Maine to find their mark, which necessitates a few practice kills along the way; these make Leftie sad but not so sad he would consider not killing.That’s obviously the gangster stuff; the family comedy element features an extended, blended brood that includes contractor Vincent (Ed Harris), his uptight, bougie second wife Sandy (Gabrielle Union) and their dorky teenage son DJ (Miles J Harvey). Their plans to enjoy New Year’s Eve are interrupted when Vincent’s previous family shows up unexpectedly. That includes his blowsy ex-wife Ruth (Jennifer Coolidge, also on excellent form), Vincent and Ruth’s grownup son Rocco (Lewis Pullman), and Rocco’s very pregnant girlfriend Marina (Emanuela Postacchini). Rocco and Marina have got mixed up in something bad and are on the run, and they have brought Ruth along with them for her own safety – after they managed to drug her with a festive cocktail of Percocet and sambuca. Soon, long submerged secrets bob to the surface where they explode like depressurised deep-sea creatures.The film requires abrupt tonal pivots to manoeuvre around the plot’s blackest bits, and director Dito Montiel and his team don’t quite manage to pull it off. The indifference to the suffering of innocent bystanders becomes an increasingly repugnant issue; it feels at times like one of Quentin Tarantino’s shonkier, uglier late-career efforts or, even worse, like a Tarantino-imitator trying to ape their hero’s swagger. But the cast’s enthusiasm, especially that of Coolidge and Murray who are willing to play the most loathsome of people, makes up for a lot.Riff Raff is available on Prime VideoExplore more on these topicsFilmCrime filmsThrillersDrama filmsComedy filmsBill MurrayEd HarrisreviewsShareReuse this content"

At night, after her kids go to bed, mum of three Suzanne (Valérie Bonneton) gets a box down from a high cupboard. Inside is her stash of vodka, which she carefully siphons into mineral water bottles for the next day. There is no pleasure in her drinking; it makes her foggy at work and detached from her boys. Bonneton, better known inFrancefor comedy roles, is terrific, with her warm, worn performance, not a scrap of sentimentality in it.Suzanne hits her rock bottom after a car accident; the court puts her sons into the care of their grandparents and orders her into rehab. First comes denial. “Some wine with dinner,” she tells the doctor who asks her about her drinking at the all-female unit. Other residents include Diane (Michèle Laroque), a famous actor who haughtily lords it over the other women, and twentysomething Alice (Sabrina Ouazani), who describes herself as a party girl but whose stories, when she shares them in group, sound more self-destructive than fun.Better Days is for the most part a modest, honest-feeling drama, insightful about shame and stigma, particularly for female alcoholics, though it is let down a bit by some over-the-top supporting acting. It falters a bit in the last 30 minutes or so too, when Suzanne travels with Diane and Alice to the desert in Morocco for a dune race in jeeps. The trip is organised by mechanic Denis (Clovis Cornillac) who has been teaching the women car maintenance. The believability blows away with the sand, as a predictable plot about camaraderie and working together takes over.Better Days is in UK cinemas from 26 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsAlcoholismFranceAlcoholEuropeHealthreviewsShareReuse this content"

As the band build up the driving reggae skank of Toots and the Maytals’ Funky Kingston, the Jamaican capital awakens. A workman’s hammer and a cleaner’s brush help tap out the tune, the stage bustles with life and in one comic vignette a banana is brandished like a gun.Later in the show, a tamarind-switch punishment will provide a more brutal percussion and real pistols will be drawn – one in each hand, as in theiconic posterfor the 1972movie. Part of the phenomenal achievement of this musical adaptation is how the story is propelled from sun-kissed comedy to elegiac tragedy with the same front-footed energy as that opener, one of several reggae standards bolstering the film’s genre-defining soundtrack featuring Jimmy Cliff, the Melodians and Desmond Dekker.Suzan-Lori Parks’ book is lighter on patois but otherwise faithful to the screenplay, co-written by the film’s director Perry Henzell and Trevor Rhone. There are new songs, too, by Parks. If you love the movie but are allergic to musical theatre, fear not – they’re sweet and dandy. One of them, Hero Don’t Never Die, augments the irresistible film-within-the-film in which the characters watch Franco Nero’s Django lay waste to his opponents. Henzell’s film itself is a spaghetti western at heart, with the arrival of an outsider, “country boy” Ivan, in a violent town controlled by crooked enforcers, a tyrannical preacher and a powerful businessman (cynical music mogul Hilton).View image in fullscreenOnly aces in this deck … The Harder They Come.Photograph: Danny KaanBut Matthew Xia’s production also draws out the film’s galvanising spirit of protest, justice and power-to-the-people kinship, reinforcing just how Ivan could grow from wannabe reggae star to criminal to folk hero modelled on the real-life outlawRhyging. It’s a personal journey of self-mythology and self-determination, unfolding in the newly independent Jamaica.There are only aces in this deck. The cast are uniformly excellent, Simon Kenny has concocted a towering, ramshackle set, costume designer Jessica Cabassa has a sharp eye for unadorned spiritual and natty secular stylings while musical director Ashton Moore’s eight-piece band is as precise as Shelley Maxwell’s stunning choreography. Maxwell brings testifying church ladies across the stage in a parade but also creates blissful, hip-circling, high-stepping party scenes incorporating dance moves like whining and the bogle.View image in fullscreenScorching … Jason Pennycooke as the Preacher and cast in The Harder They Come.Photograph: Danny KaanIn the film, music is a constant backdrop and often used in a naturalistic fashion to suit the freewheeling tone rather than to power a set piece. This stage version does both and there is a scorching sequence in which the preacher’s congregation shed their robes for an unholy dancehall grind enacting their fantasies, complete with throbbing bass.Shelley Maxwell: the soul-stirring master mover who makes superheroes danceRead moreTime after time, lyrics deepen characterisation or plot: the play on words in Hitting With Music reflects Hilton’s aggressive campaign for chart-toppers, Pressure Drop serves not as breezy balm but doom-laden prophecy of Ivan’s fate while Rebel in Me comes with projections of lush Jamaican countryside on a shantytown’s makeshift bedsheet screen.The title song is robust enough to withstand several renditions, bringing out its grit and joy, performed by Natey Jones who returns to the role of Ivan after a different 2023 production at New York’s Public theater. Madeline Charlemagne’s devout Elsa, more defiant than in the film, is given a tender love song for Ivan, “a hymn of him”, by Parks. Jason Pennycooke (Preacher), Thomas Vernal (Hilton) and Danny Bailey (as hustling José) all manage to wring humour and menace from their roles.

A black hole could also be the gap that has opened up in the ceiling of a windowless A&E department, where a drip becomes a torrent, a metaphor for a crumblingNHS. And a “black hole of greed” is what playwright Uma Nada-Rajah sees in a system in which profit frequently comes before health.View image in fullscreenOperating theatre … Helen Logan in Black Hole Sign.Photograph: Mihaela BodlovicAs a staff nurse who works in critical care, Nada-Rajah writes with authority. All her characters, whether it is the recovering alcoholic with hours to live (Beruce Khan), the self-harming young woman who claims to have had a fall (Betty Valencia), the delirious octogenarian who thinks she is at a 1970s disco (Ann Louise Ross) or the man with a spike in his buttocks (Martin Docherty), have the ring of messy truth.So too does the playwright’s black humour. There are a lot of attempts at care in this overstretched ward but no room to be sentimental. This is where human bodies end up, with all their frailty, pain and incontinence, and it takes pragmatism to deal with them.That creates many laughs in a play that unfolds like a Brechtian parable of cause and effect: the more pressure bearing down on the nurses the more inevitably something will go fatally wrong. The senior charge nurse Crea (Helen Logan), her over-committed acolyte Ani (Dani Heron) and their clueless student Lina (Valencia again) are an accident waiting to happen.It is a shaming message, in a production fluidly staged by Gareth Nicholls for the Tron and Edinburgh’s Traverse. If its imaginative collision of pathos, comedy, polemic and drug-induced dream sequence creates an uneven pace and some bumpy shifts in tone, it is also a clear-eyed plea for cash as well as compassion.AtTron theatre, Glasgow, until 4 October.

Photograph: YushyAway from the light and glamour of mainstream clubbing, Yushy spent three years recording a shadowy parallel scene: one built on mutual trust and secret group chatsByUpasana Das; photographs by YushyWed 24 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 24 Sep 2025 02.01 EDTShareYushy was on a packed tube on New Year’s Eve when he heard voices yell his name. He recognised their faces from the squat raves he had been photographing. “We’re going to a party right now,” they whispered. “I have my camera,” he said, and followed them. He didn’t know anything else about them. In the squat rave underground, which thrives on anonymity and secret locations, it didn’t matter. “They trusted me with them, and I trusted them to take me to the rave,” he says.His new book, Section 63: Underground and Unmastered, documents three years in this London scene. Yushy started out as a fresher when he replied to a party promoter looking for a photographer. But he grew bored with the more mainstream events he was photographing, and started asking attendees about underground happenings. “I also asked around in group chats,” he says, “Which I later found out – once I was inside the official rave group chat – were placeholders for people to be approved. Purgatory, essentially!”View image in fullscreenPassing a cigarette over the decks.Once accepted into the scene, Yushy realised that amid multiple UK club closures every week, these squat raves were bringing back the rebellious energy of acid house raves, which which were outlawed in the Public Order Act of 1994: the book is named after section 63, which restricted public gatherings around music “characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats”.“Thirty years later, things are still awful and the cost of living is rising through the roof, leading to clubs closing,” he says, “Fun is being monitored – but the existence of these raves prove there’s ways to not succumb to that.”View image in fullscreenSmoking at a rave.It’s an unwritten rule that there’s no social media at these raves. “You have to pay an entry, but you know it’s a space where you can dance and not be bothered,” he said, “You can sit down with your friends and just chill for a few hours or leave and not worry about how you’re exiting the party.” The constant documentation of had-to-be-there moments in the mainstream, he says, makes letting loose “a lot harder as everyone is trying to create this fear of missing out online”. His work intentionally sits outside that. “I hope it is a visual language where people don’t know where or when the photos were taken,” he says. “I’ve had people come to me saying, oh this party was in 1993. I hate to break it to them.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenFollowing the co-ordinates, and the view from a venue.Community is key to the scene. Promoters send messages with various locations en route to the party; as hopeful revellers find one another, they group together and receive more coordinates. Once they reach a particular spot, promoters may share a phone number with an answering machine that reveals the final party location. “You may not speak to each other again until the next party, but you listened and trusted each other,” says Yushy.He feels similar when a party offers drug testing – especially since party drugs became more extreme post-pandemic. “They make people more aware about what they consume,” he says. “Approaching a medical professional, if they wanted [advice on how] to do [drugs] safely, could get them in trouble.” But at one of these raves, he says, “if someone isn’t feeling well, people would offer water, some paracetamol and see if you need help to get home. This level of kindness to your fellow raver isn’t there in the mainstream.”View image in fullscreenThe chillout zone under a bridge.The risk of police turning up and unceremoniously pulling the plug also means scene members have to keep their wits about them. Once, when some ravers didn’t recognise Yushy and objected to him taking photos, they pulled a knife – then he showed them his Instagram account and they realised they had mutual friends. And when police entered a party one night, he could easily have shown his press card and got away. But if he did that, he says, “all my credibility is lost. We all left together, and I fell into a deep puddle while running away. I got rid of the card that day.”View image in fullscreenA dancer in silhouette.Of course, shady promoters exist, sometimes dashing out the back of a building with a box full of cash from the entry fees. “You suddenly find yourself in an empty warehouse with no music and an empty speaker system that doesn’t work,” says Yushy. “And there’s no chance to know until you’re through the door. But it’s also about being adaptable for me.” In one photograph, a couple kisses on an empty dancefloor. “I took that after the promoters ran out. It’s a uniquely intimate moment that they’re having between them, despite the circumstances. It made it worth what happened.”Spending time in these empty premises also offers bleak insight into cultural closures and property ownership interests in the capital. Often, says Yushy, you arrive at a party location and realise you’ve been there before, in the space’s former life. One rave was in a former cinema. “It became apparent it had closed a few months prior because of bankruptcy. It felt strange and familiar.”View image in fullscreenDancers in front of speakers.Or, he says, parties take place in London buildings in hip parts of town that have been lying empty for two decades. “Which is crazy,” he says. “It could be turned into flats, but the landlord refuses. Sometimes promoters would enter a commercial building and have people who are homeless around the area keep the building occupied until a party, after which they leave the building as they found it. They’re doing more than any landlord or business-owner will for any community around them.”Section 63: Underground & Unmastered – Documenting Underground London Raves isout now on Velocity PressExplore more on these topicsThe Guardian picture essayPhotographyClubbingClub culturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He democratised the dancefloor, fearlessly blended genres and understood the power of personalityWed 24 Sep 2025 07.01 EDTLast modified on Wed 24 Sep 2025 07.02 EDTShareIf you are a fan of club culture, soul, Brit funk, acid house, all-dayers, the radio edit of Kraftwerk’s Autobahn, weekenders or Sinéad O’Connor then – whether you know it or not – you are part of the world shaped by Chris Hill,who died on 11 September after a short illness.Hill was an Essex-born, working-class DJ who loved Black music so much he made it his mission to bring it to the pubs, clubs, airwaves, pop charts and record shops of England by any means necessary. He started out in the 1960s trading blues records and landed a residency in 1967 playing jazz at The Orsett Cock in Essex; later came a soul residency at the Goldmine nightclub on Canvey Island, Essex, and from there to the Lacy Lady in Ilford, east London, and headlining the CaisterSoulWeekender in Norfolk.Along the way, he formed the Funk Mafia, a group of DJs including Greg Edwards, DJ Froggy, Jeff Young and a young Pete Tong, appeared on the pirate Radio Invicta 92.4 FM, and co-founded the Ensign label with Nigel Grainge, where he signed O’Connor, the Boomtown Rats, Eddy Grant and many more.‘There were pitched battles, fist fights’: how Britfunk overcame racism to reinvigorate UK popRead moreWhen I was a 15-year-old funkateer, Hill meant the world to me. His impeccable taste and understanding of music, fashion and audiences – all delivered in his broad Essex accent, with a missionary zeal and a flamboyant style – helped forge the template of the “cultural influencer” way before the architecture of influence-as-product was even a thing. He saw the club as a place of communion and community – diverse, multiracial, without prejudice or exclusion. He democratised the dancefloor, breaking the wall between dancers and onlookers opening hearts and minds by fearlessly blending genres.He was untouchable – he was to clubbing what jazz, funk and soul DJ Robbie Vincent was to radio. I was so committed to his gospel that one day I broke off from playing seven-a-side because rumour had it that Hilly lived near the pitches, so I went in search of what might be his home.I found my tribe, one formed in Hill’s image, at the club Tiffany’s in Purley: attired in leather pegged trousers and Pod shoes walking the gauntlet of taunting punks and skins. The perpetual soundtrack included Jingo by Cándido Camero, Night Cruiser by Eumir Deodato and Time by Light of the World, a group that Hill had signed and developed into the UK’s Earth, Wind & Fire. We once united at Bluebird Records in Paddington, west London, for a coach ride to join thousands of other kids from all around the country at the Caister Soul Weekender, where people of all backgrounds descended on an out-of-season Norfolk holiday camp for the day: the embodiment of one nation under a groove.View image in fullscreen‘One of the first British DJs that people would pay to see’ … Hill at an all-dayer in Brighton in 1979.Photograph: © Tony DearsleyThe kind of genre fluidity that Hill proselytised is now considered the norm, but he was the first. His residency at the Goldmine quickly became a southern mecca for soul pilgrims. In the mid-70s, it also became the centre of a swing revival, where kids would jive to Jimmie Lunceford and Count Basie, decked out in 40s clobber. Here, you could rub shoulders with a who’s who of the time, from Sade to Siouxsie Sioux. Then, at the Lacy Lady in the Ilford suburbs, he put on the Clash, the Damned and Subway Sect, while playing Fela Kuti and Krautrock alongside his beloved jazz funk and soul. (A little-known fact: the Clash’s Mick Jones was a revered dancer at Chris’s weekly soul session. After all, in the words of Andrew Weatherall: “The initial punk scene in London was a load of bored soul boys who liked dressing up.”Hill clearly understood the power of personality, making him one of the first British DJs that people would pay to see. He was from a theatrical background, with a lifelong passion for Shakespeare and could easily have taken that path. Uninterested in being cool, he doubled up as his own MC, urging the crowd to participate and, in so doing, continuing the lineage of a particularly British form of entertainer. I remember him playing Latin America by Cedar Walton to 2,000 kids at Caister at midnight on a Saturday: he told us to dance and we obeyed! That power also cultivated trends and dance fashions: he took the world-famous rowing-boat dance, normally associated with Oops Upside Your Head by the Gap Band, and popularised it, alongside Ring My Bell by Anita Ward.But Hill was less interested in advancing himself as a personality than he was using his platforms to evangelise and push forward the culture. While he never became a full-time radio jock, he broadcast frequently on Radio Invicta, the first specialist Black music pirate on the FM dial. As he put it: “The second you make it all about you … you’ve already lost. It’s about people – it always has been and it always will be.”When he got behind a record he loved, he could influence the charts – back when they were still a barometer of culture, not just sales: he supplied the energy behindJazzCarnival by Azymuth, British Hustle by Hi-Tension and Southern Freeez by Freeez. He fundamentally helped shape the UK’s broad taste in popular music – until the mid-80s, when the birth of acid house ushered in a new generation of DJs including Carl Cox, Paul Oakenfold and Danny Rampling. Hill’s approach was based on diversity and inclusion, preaching unity – something we would do well to remember today, alongside his memory.Thanks to Mark“Snowboy” Cotgrove for his help with some of these anecdotes and for flying the flag for Chris Hill until the end.Gilles Peterson is a BBC Radio 6 Music DJExplore more on these topicsMusicClub cultureSoulClubbingDance musicJazzcommentShareReuse this content"

Wayward son of the underworld Zagreus’s repeated attempts to abscond from his purgatorial prison offered catharsis at a time when none of us could leave our homes. It did no harm that it was genuinely, unapologetically sexy: all of artist Jen Zee’s character designs had abs hewn from Olympian rock, and just about everyone addressed you as if they’d seen you from across the bar and really dug your vibe. Winning the favour of these absurdly attractive Greek gods was the key to finally getting above ground. It was – apologies – a hell of an escape.And a hell of an act to follow, too. But in Hades II, composer Darren Korb delivers a thunderously dramatic score for the closing stages of your Olympian ascent that reaches alevel of operatic grandeurto trump anything in the original game. Zee’s new character illustrations (including onereturning favouritein a leopardskin posing pouch) are, if anything, likely to inspire even more aggressively thirsty fanart and fanfic. And writer Greg Kasavin’s wonderful script is wittier, wiser and flirtier than ever.Zagreus has absconded for the sequel: this time you’re his sister Melinoë, who finds herself at a crossroads.Not the motel, but the woodland clearing she calls home, alongside a clutch of spectral Shades and mentor Hecate. It might be gloomy and damp, but unlike Zag, she’s not looking to get away: she ventures out to fight each night because the Titan of Time, Chronos, is up to no good. Yes, in a wry subversion of what we were all doing five years ago, Supergiant is now literally inviting us to kill Time. It’s a battle on two fronts, and at two extremes: deep beneath the surface, and at the peak of Mount Olympus.View image in fullscreenToil and trouble … Hades II.Photograph: Supergiant GamesYou probably won’t even beat Hecate on your first attempt – a fight against your “headmistress” is only the first test of your combat skills. But therein lies the appeal of run-based games such as Hades II. Each night represents a chance to improve, to hone your (witch)craft. There are lessons to be learned in failure, but on each run you’ll makesomemeasure of progress. It leans fully into its occult theme: you’ll forage ingredients to drop into the cauldron between runs, and your spells and incantations improve your chances of survival.It draws inspiration, too, fromanother pandemic favourite. Animals crossing your path can sniff out resourcesandhelp in battle. Pale raven Raki pecks at rocks and foes alike, while faithful hound Hecuba can leave opponents stunned while digging up restorative snacks. I personally found it hard to look beyond wildcat Toula, who lunges, claws bared, at nearby opponents – when she can be bothered, at least. She also allows you to defy death once per run; with nine lives, she can afford to spare one.You’ll need the help of these unfamiliar familiars, and every bit of godly assistance besides, to conquer Chronos. Encounters are every bit as intense as you’d hope for, and it takes a minute to adjust to Melinoë’s enchanted arsenal. Fittingly, even as you wield her witch’s staff like a spear, combat feels closer to sorcery. A black coat that allows you to punch opponents into the ether doubles as a magic jetpack. The umbral flames have become my go-to, usually powered up by blacksmithHephaestus. As difficult as Hades II gets, you have more ways than ever to weight the dice in your favour. Conversely, you can make Olympus’s slopes even steeper: nightmarish boss-fight variants, for instance, demand mastery of the game’s most deliciously evil risk-reward mechanic.One of the joys of Hades II is getting caught up in the internecine discord amongthe dysfunctional extended family. But it’s ultimately aboutresolvingconflict. Sure, not everyone has read the memo: Scylla, front woman of a pop-punk trio of Sirens, cheerfully sings aboutclawing out your eyes and drowning youin the dank depths ofOceanus. But even the likes of power-suited Chaos and grumpy Nemesis (so affronted by you effectively doing her job that she’ll sporadically show up to challenge you to a contest, before barricading a potential exit) can be won over with a gift of nectar – or ambrosia. The game’s ending, too, makes it abundantly clear that any fight against forces of oppression requires us all to play a part, no matter how small; that whether you go low or high, resistance requires strength that can only come from solidarity.Explore more on these topicsGamesAdventure gamesAction gamesPCNintendo SwitchNintendo Switch 2reviewsShareReuse this content"

It started out as essentially a house party: a gathering of 27 people in the living room of Atari designer Chris Crawford. By the mid-90s it had left Chris’s house and grown to more than 4,000 attenders, and in 2005 found a permanent home in San Francisco’s Moscone Center. These days, about 30,000 game development professionals of all kinds attend every year. The online GDC Vaultis a precious troveof game development history and useful advice for any gaming discipline.GDC has developed a bit of an image problem in recent years, however, as we havereportedbefore. It’s prohibitively expensive for developers: a conference pass is more than $1,500, and travel and accommodation in one of the world’s most expensive cities quickly multiplies the total cost to anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000 (even for a hotel room with approximately the dimensions and safety of a phone booth).On top of that, since Trump was re-elected president, a large percentage of the global video game development community is reluctant to visit the US. And the vibe of the event has been somewhat soured by the sudden withdrawal of funding from the entire games industry, alongside the threats to developers’ livelihoods from AI and ever-present layoffs. If nobody is funding games, what’s the point of travelling for days and spending thousands to attend some meetings?As Jon Ingold, founder of UK studio Inkle, puts it: “GDC as an industry brokerage doesn’t make sense when there’s no money, no hiring, and the US is a hostile place to be … I fear whatever they do instead is too little too late; the executive club don’t leave much behind when they move out.”Perhaps this is why the event has decided to rebrand. On Monday night it was announced that Game Developers Conference is now GDC: Festival of Gaming. Avision presentationpromises “a full week of opportunity” in “a space where the full B2B games ecosystem connects”. It is quite hard to discern from this presentation what will actually be changing, but the key takeaways seem to be that getting a pass will be simpler, and events will now be all over the city rather than just at its Moscone conference centre.View image in fullscreenCalifornia calling … inside the GDC: Festival of Gaming.Unfortunately this rebrand does not address the concerns that developers have been expressing for years: namely, that access isn’t good enough, and that San Francisco (and perhaps, at this point, the US more broadly) is a terrible place for a global games conference. “Despite clear Covid-era evidence that GDC could be digitally accessible, and there being no reason but [organiser] Informa’s bottom line for the event being so expensive, GDC remains offline-only and the ticket prices obscene,” says independent game developer and consultant Rami Ismail, who has long been vocal about GDC’s problems on behalf of the global developer community. “Many developers around the world spend thousands to have their visas rejected after months or even years of wait. Even if they get the visa, the US has never been a safe place to visit, in terms of weapons, crime and health costs. [And] the Trump administrations’ institution of alt-right populism has made it unacceptably dangerous to even enter the country for most.”This statement is not overblown. Stories about visitors to the US being refused entry to the country anddeportedor – much worse – detained by Ice have been everywhere since Trump’s re-election. People aretravelling with burner phonesand scrubbing their social media. Anecdotally, many European developers and journalists, myself included, are reluctant to travel to the US under the current administration. For people coming from Arabic or South American countries, the concerns are significantly greater.I think most of the global game development workforce would agree that the US doesn’t make sense as a hub for the industry any more. San Francisco used to be one of the world’s centres of game development, and it still is home to some top-class companies and studios, but I can’t be the only one who feels that the city has been hollowed out by Silicon Valley types and no longer has the creative atmosphere that it did.There’s an easy alternative: Canada’s generous tax breaks have made it a very attractive place to develop games, and its current government is not actively hostile to foreigners. Local game developer gatherings exist in most countries, from Brighton’s Develop in the UK toGamesConnect in Australia. Gamescom now takes place in Cologne, Singapore and Brazil, with growing developer events alongside the public-facing ones. There’s nothing that the GDC organisers can do about the Trump administration, but if it wants to retain its position as a professional gaming nexus, it’s going to take more than a rebrand to make the case.What to playUncomfortably funny … Consume Me.Photograph: Jenny Jiao HsiaVideo game season is ramping up and there’s plenty to choose from: Supergiant’s painfully stylish mythological action game Hades II is just out of early access, and it’s excellent. Horror reboot Silent Hill f is also delighting (most) critics.I am playingConsume Me,developer Jenny Jiao Hsia’s uncomfortably funny game about surviving high school at the height of 2000s diet culture. As you go about Jenny’s relatable teenage life – involving absurd mini-games about trying to concentrate in class and walking the dog – you’re also having painfully awkward conversations with your parents about your weight, trying to Tetris foodstuffs on to your plate and waking up with food anxiety.This will be an uncomfortable topic for many people; it brings back depressing memories about the disturbing female body standards of the 2000s, and it may feel difficult to enjoy if you’ve ever struggled with disordered eating (or known someone who has). But these things are handled with humour, compassion and enough satirical bite (sorry) to make the discomfort worthwhile.Available on:PCEstimated playtime:five hoursskip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Two of my favourites include: “Don’t hesitate; when the time comes, just act” (Wolf O’Donnell, Star Fox Assault) and “A stubborn enough person can survive just about anything; rage is a hell of an anaesthetic” (Zaeed Massani, Mass Effect 2).Which video game words of wisdomhave struck a chord with you?”This is perhaps an unpopular opinion, but I believe that video games are usually profound by accident. Many of the stickiest quotes from games arise from some quirk of translation or voice acting (“I used to be an adventurer … but then I took an arrow to the knee”, “All your base are belong to us”, “Jill, the master of unlocking”). They’re often memorable for their absurdity rather than their deep meaning.That said, the phrase “It’s dangerous to go alone – take this” from the original Legend of Zelda has somehow made its way into my avoidant heart as genuine words of warmth, and “The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world” from Half-Life 2 has stuck with me.This is a good one to open up to the readership: do you have a video game quote that actually means something to you?If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter, including your favourite game quotes – hit reply or email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The families of local fishers do a brisk trade at stands piled high with still-wriggling sole, plaice, mackerel, crab and red mullet that have come straight from the nets of small boats docked below on the quayside.View image in fullscreenMonet painted several pictures of Trouville in 1870 including the boardwalk.Photograph: AlamyFor visitors who have booked one of Trouville’s numerous self-catering apartments, the market is an ideal place to shop for dinner or a picnic, but I carry on into the centre of town to the unbeatably pricedHôtel Le Fer à Cheval(doubles from just €59 room-only in winter/around€140 in peak season). Identical twins Virginie and Sonia Bisson created their smart, welcoming hotel from three adjoining mansions 20 years ago, and are a mine of insider tips. So after checking in my bags, I take their advice and head straight for the beach bar Le Galatée a couple of hundred yards away from the hotel.The Queen of Beaches now resembles a stately dowager, spoiling holidaymakers with classic seaside treats, from pony rides to petanqueAn iconic wooden boardwalk, Promenade Savignac,runs parallel to the lapping waves for more than a kilometre, the scene pretty much unchanged from Claude Monet’s 1870 impressionist masterpiece Promenade à Trouville. The terrace of Le Galatée is certainly the strategic place to sit, indulging in their famous chocolat chaud or an ice-cream sundae while taking the pulse of what is now a buzzing family resort.The Reine des Plages now resembles a stately dowager, spoiling holidaymakers with classic seaside treats such as pony rides on the beach, mini golf and petanque. The boardwalk is lined with Normandy’s distinctive 19th-century half-timbered villas and palatial mansions, each trying to outdo its neighbour for opulence and grandeur. The iconicHôtel Les Roches Noires– again immortalised by Monet, whose painting now hangs in the Musée d’Orsay – is a luxurious hotel, as many of these stately piles once were until they were converted into private apartments.View image in fullscreenThe town’s distinctive belle epoque architecture .Photograph: Mihai Barbat/AlamyWhile Deauville’s boardwalk is lined with art deco bathing cabins dedicated to Hollywood stars who have attended theDeauville American Film Festival, such as Gene Kelly, Kirk Douglas and Marilyn Monroe, Trouville offers plain wooden benches bearing the names of writers drawn here for inspiration: Gustave Flaubert, Marcel Proust, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas. Just behind Les Roches Noires, I walk uphill to the imposingVilla Montebello, home of the municipal museum, where I discover that Trouville was also a favourite destination for the 19th-century painters Courbet, Corot, Caillebotte and above all Eugène Boudin, later acclaimed as the father of impressionismAside from lazing on the beach, browsing retro fashion boutiques such as À La Petite Jeannette and Devred 1902, or exploring Trouville’s distinctive maze of narrow alleyways and steep staircases that climb high above the main town, the big draw here is eating out. Like every visitor, I am charmed by the raucous fishmongers lining the landmark Marché aux Poissons. With tables along the pavement, they serveplateaux de fruits de merpiled high with oysters, clams, prawns, whelks, cockles and mussels. Lunch is a memorable occasion, especially accompanied by a chilled bottle of Muscadet, though beware the bill – the prices you see on the stall are for takeaway, with a mark-up when served at the table. As Stéphane Brassy, president of the Trouville fishmongers association, tells me between shucking oysters: “We have queues of tourists lining up here every day of the week. Everyone loves the banter and understands that the quality of our fish and seafood comes at a certain price.”View image in fullscreenSeafood at the town’s fish market.Photograph: Image Professionals/AlamyIn the evening, plush brasseries such asLes VapeursandLe Centralare packed, but in the back streets I discover two exceptional addresses that have both been open for less than a year. The romanticChez Ginetteis decorated with checked tablecloths and chintzy wallpaper, presenting a bistronomique menu ofgrand-mèrerecipes such as eggs mimosa with smoked mackerel (€4.90), chicken cordon bleu (€17.90) or juicy bavette steak, frites and creamy camembert sauce (€18.90).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His name betrays Anglo-French roots, but Jarvis says that, “even though I was brought up on baked beans and fried sausages, my cooking inspiration is very much French. I was looking to escape the high-pressure cooking world of Parisian fine dining and Trouville was the perfect solution, especially with the wonderful local produce from small boat fishers and organic farmers.” His menu changes every week and includes dishes such as deep-fried artichoke resting on a creamy chicken liver mousse, frogs’ legs alongside spicy merguez sausage, smoked beetroot with tapenade and wild sorrel.But Trouville-sur-mer is not just a seaside destination, as the idyllic Normandy countryside of the Pays d’Auge begins just outside town.Les Trouvillaisesbike shop recommends hiring an ebike (€35 per day) to comfortably explore the region’s rolling hills, and a leisurely 22-mile (35km) ride allows for stop-offs at an artisan dairy farm and ancientcidrerie.AtLa Ferme Martin, Thierry and Caroline Martin are the fourth generation to produce artisan, raw-milk Pont-l’Évêque cheese. Each morning, Caroline takes the still-warm milk, fresh from their 60-cow herd, and makes cheeses in her tiny dairy, where a steady stream of locals and tourists turn up to buy direct from the farm.View image in fullscreenBeach huts on Promenade Savignac with 19th-century villas behind.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyJust outside the bustling market town of Pont-l’Évêque lies the sprawling 17th-century manor and orchards ofMaison Drouin, the perfect place to discover the secrets of cider and calvados. Half a dozen Normancolombage(half-timbered) outbuildings house a press for creating the apple juice, vats to ferment and age the cider, an alembic still for distilling, a barrel room to age the calvados, and a busy boutique. No reservation is necessary, and as Guillaume Drouin explains, “We offer the chance to taste all our products, take a tour explaining our orchards with 36 varieties of apples, then see how we make everything. There is no charge, because I want our visitors to try, to understand and enjoy, rather than thinking they are paying to enter some kind of tourist attraction.”Back in Trouville, on the way to the station, I cannot resist a glimpse inside the fabulous belle epoqueCasino Barrière, an opulent reminder that this was one of the early magnets drawing travellers to Normandy a century ago. Just outside, in a former police building, a new attraction is opening at the end of October:Le Ciné Bistrois the brainchild of Claude Lelouch, director of the acclaimedUn Homme et Une Femme(1966), which he filmed in Trouville, and will offer an evening movie screening followed by dinner. Definitely a good reason to come back.The trip wasprovided byCalvados Attractivité.

This is a global Slow Food initiative to record and protect traditional and indigenous foods, from the black salt of Boke, Ethiopia, to the Tamworth pig, which I served from nose to tail as a main course at the banquet. Locatelli’s chosen ingredient was the bronte pistachio, which he showcased with the most luxurious tart. Here, I’ve adapted his recipe for a classic basil pesto to use up excess fennel fronds, and used pistachios instead of pine nuts, not only because they’re incredible in pesto but also as nod to that amazing tart.Fennel frond and bronte pistachio pesto (and an optional shaved fennel salad)Farmers’ market fennel often comes with an incredible plume of feathery fronds, but even supermarket fennel often has a few sprigs at the top of the bulb. They make the most wonderfully fragrant pesto, and if need be can be bulked out with some of the fennel stalk or other soft herbs (from stem to leaf) such as basil, parsley or coriander.Locatelli’s pesto recipe focuses on the use of a mortar and pestle, a tool I adore, but I’ve always found it hard to grind leaves to a paste, so I tend to use a blender instead. If you are using a mortar and pestle, start by crushing the garlic to a paste with a pinch of salt, then lightly crush the nuts, then grind in the fennel fronds a bit at a time, before mixing in the grated cheese and oil. Breaking from tradition, I’ve also included lemon at the end to lift the dish and help soften the fennel. The pesto is ready to use straight away, but I prefer to let it rest for a few hours, or even a day, to soften and meld together into a harmonious, glutamate-rich dressing. It can be used like regular pesto, simply tossed through pasta or gnocchi, or spooned over roast vegetables, as well as to marinate meat or to top salads.For the pesto (makes about 350g, or enough for about 6 servings)1 garlic clove, peeled50g shelled bronte pistachios, or another nut or seed, such as pumpkin seeds, walnuts or pine nuts125g fennel fronds and thin stalks(if need be, make up the weight with some other soft herbs such as parsley, coriander or basil, or even a slice or two of the bulb)Juice of ½ lemon, plus the finely grated zest if it’s organic and unwaxed25g pecorino, or parmesan, grated150ml extra-virgin olive oil1 pinch sea saltFor the salad2 fennel bulbsExtra-virgin olive oil, to tasteJuice of ½ lemon, plus the finely grated zest if it’s organic and unwaxedSalt and black pepperFennel frond and pistachio pesto, to taste (see above and method)Shaved pecorino, or parmesan, to tasteTo make the pesto, put the garlic, nuts, fennel, lemon juice and zest (if using), pecorino, oil and salt in a blender, and pulse to a coarse paste – you’ll probably need to stop the blender and scrape down the sides every now and then. Decant into a clean jar and store in the fridge for up to five days.To the fennel salad topped with fennel pesto, slice the fennel bulbs very thinly, ideally using a mandoline, then put in a large bowl. Drizzle over a little extra-virgin olive oil, then add the lemon juice and grated zest, if using, a pinch of sea salt and some freshly ground black pepper. Scatter over a platter, dot with pesto to taste and finish with pecorino shavings. The salad is lovely eaten immediately, but it holds up surprisingly well to waiting a while.Explore more on these topicsHerbs and spicesWaste notSauces and graviesFoodFood wasteVegetablesItalian food and drinkSaladfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the UK, with its distinct seasons, that weather influences mood, so pairing the right dish with the climate and season feels deeply nourishing, and goes far beyond mere sustenance. To me, pasta is the most versatile of food types and lends itself perfectly to such seasonal cooking: a walk through damp woodland, say, often makes me crave wild mushrooms, sauteed with garlic and herbs, then tossed with fettuccine, while, as the days shorten and the air cools, a slow-cooked game ragu with penne always hits the spot, as does a warming blast of ’nduja in a creamy sauce. And when indulgence calls, a rich walnut, egg and parmesan sauce is wickedly satisfying.Pappardelle with parmesan, creme fraiche and toasted walnuts (pictured top)You need to be hungry for this one, and I recommend eating it after you’ve done some form of exercise, so you feel as if you’ve earned it. It’s supremely indulgent and naughty, but boy oh boyis it good. The sauce also works with freshstracci, or dried penne and rigatoni.Prep10 minCook30 minServes4Sea salt and black pepper200g creme fraiche2 tsp marjoram leaves200g parmesan, finely grated, plus extra to finish50g unsalted butter40g shelled walnuts450g fresh pappardelle, or dried4 egg yolks(optional)Bring four to five litres of water to a boil in a large pot and add a fistful of salt. Put the creme fraiche, marjoram, a good pinch of ground black pepper, the grated parmesan and 20ml cold water in a nonstick saucepan and stir over a very low heat for five to eight minutes, until they melt into a smooth, oozy sauce; make sure the sauce doesn’t boil, otherwise it will split. Take off the heat.Melt the butter in a frying pan on a medium-low heat, then add the walnuts and saute, stirring, for two minutes, until lightly toasted. Tip on to a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain and cool, then roughly chop or pound into 5mm pieces.Loosen the fresh pasta bundles with your fingers, so they won’t stick together as they cook, then drop into the boiling water and cook for a minute to a minute and a half; if using dried pappardelle, cook for eight to 10 minutes, or according to the packet instructions, until al dente. Drain the pasta, saving two mugs of the cooking water.Off the heat, return the pasta back to the empty pot, add half a mug (about 120ml) of the reserved water and stir. Add the parmesan and creme fraiche sauce, using a spatula to scrape all of it out of the pan, then stir over a low-medium heat for about a minute, until the liquid reduces a bit and the sauce turns oozy; if the sauce seems a bit dry, add splashes of the reserved water to loosen it, and keep stirring until you hit that sweet spot. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if required.Divide the pasta and sauce between four hot plates, sprinkle over the nuts and, if you’re feeling racy, nestle an egg yolk in the centre. If you’ve added the egg yolk, encourage your guests to stir it into the pasta before they start eating, so the residual heat gently cooks it. Eat immediately, topped with more grated parmesan, if you like. I’d recommend crunchy bread on the side to mop up the sauce.Fettuccine with ’nduja, lemon and mascarponeView image in fullscreenTim Siadatan’s fettuccine with ’nduja lemon and mascarpone.I’ve always wanted to make a pasta dish using ’nduja where the chilli doesn’t blow your head off. Here, the addition of mascarpone mellows the spiciness of the sausage and creates a smooth, creamy yet rich sauce. The strength of ’nduja varies, so you may need to use a bit more or less – taste it first and adjust accordingly. The acidity in the lemon, meanwhile, brings balance, harmony and zing. This sauce also works well with freshpici, or dried spaghetti, bucatini, linguine, penne, fusilli and farfalle.Prep10 minCook30 minServes4About 75g ’nduja500g mascarponeFinely grated zest and juice of 1 lemonSea salt450g fresh fettuccine, or dried4 tbsp finely chopped flat-leaf parsleyParmesan, finely grated, to finishPut the ’nduja in a bowl and bring to room temperature, so it becomes malleable. Add the mascarpone and lemon zest, and mix to a smoothish paste. It can now be stored in a sealed container in the fridge for up to five days.Bring four to five litres of water to a boil in a large pot and add a fistful of salt. Put the ’nduja-mascarpone paste in a pan large enough to hold the cooked pasta easily. Add half a mug (about 120ml) of the salted pasta water and heat gently, stirring, to melt the paste and create a sauce. Take off the heat.Loosen the fresh pasta bundles, so they won’t stick together as they cook, then drop into the boiling water and cook for a minute to a minute and a half; if using dried fettuccine, cook for eight to 10 minutes, or according to the packet instructions, until al dente. Drain the pasta and reserve two mugs of its cooking water.Transfer the pasta to the pan of ’nduja sauce and add half a mug (about 120ml) of the reserved water, the lemon juice, chopped parsley and a pinch of salt. Stir vigorously for at least 30 seconds, until the sauce is mixed around the pasta and turns smooth and creamy; if the sauce seems too dry, add splashes of reserved pasta water to loosen it as you stir. You want the strands to slide freely over each other, and for a layer of sauce to cover the bottom of the pan; my visual reference for the sauce is a slow-moving lava field. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if required.Serve on hot plates with a creamy halo of sauce all around the pasta, then finish with grated parmesan. The sauce sucks up the parmesan quickly and can easily become dry, so be sure to have that excess halo around the plated pasta.Tim Siadatan is co-founder ofTrulloandPadella, both in London.
