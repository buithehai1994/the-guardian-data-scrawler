I have – and it was almost as miserable as my chest infectionSimon HattenstoneWes Streeting’s plan to make booking easier made sense. Then I encountered an AI triagist, a stubborn receptionist and a Kafkaesque vicious circleWed 10 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 12.44 ESTShareAcouple of months ago the health secretary, Wes Streeting, rolled out his latest master plan to save the NHS. From 1 October, it became compulsory for all GP practices in England to offer the online option for patients torequest non-urgent appointmentsor medical advice throughout core working hours (8am to 6.30pm, Monday to Friday).The doctors’ unionmight not have much liked it, but it made sense to regular punters like me. It seemed like a common sense means of avoiding the maddening early morning scramble for the few available appointments, hanging on for an age, only to be told all the slots have gone. Or worse, just have the phone go dead on you.Who wouldn’t prefer filling out a form in relative serenity? And, of course, it was just an option. TheNHSmade it clear that those who struggled with literacy or forms, or didn’t have access to the right technology, could still phone. So it seemed like the best of all worlds.Only Streeting hadn’t bargained for practices misusing the system.A few days ago, I started getting typical winter flu symptoms. I have a history of flu turning into bacterial pneumonia, and on one occasion sepsis. A course of antibiotics tends to knock it on the head early.I dutifully filled in the online form because it has always been a nightmare getting through to the GP. I explained my history – chest, pneumonia, sepsis. At the end, I discovered I had been triaged by AI and it had decidednotto refer me to the GP. I was told that my request for an appointment would be going no further and I had to talk to the GP directly. It explained that the symptoms I described sounded potentially dangerous. “We can’t safely assess your symptoms through this online request. You need to talk to somebody today instead,” the AI triagist replied in the name of my GP practice.It seemed to make sense. After all, the form is primarily for non-urgent cases, and it had decided mine could be serious. But I didn’t realise I was trapped in a catch-22 at that point.I did what I’ve always done before the introduction of the online system. I phoned the practice.Me: “Hi, could I make an appointment with the doctor please? I think I have a chest infection.”Receptionist: “You have to fill in an e-form. We are no longer making appointments by phone.”Even the language was alienating. God knows how I’d cope if I was much older or struggling to make sense of the digital world.“I have filled in the form. It rejected me, and said it wouldn’t pass on my complaint and I had to speak to the practice directly.”“Sorry, you need to fill in the e-form to get an appointment,” she repeated.I explained that meant it was now impossible for me to get an appointment if the online form rejected me as too serious and the practice simply didn’t want to know unless it was via the form. As Kafkaesque vicious circles went, it was up with the best of them. If I’d not felt so bad I might have found it funny. Briefly.But I was one of the fortunate patients – I knew the form was an option, not a replacement, and I was gobby enough to say so. Disturbingly, the practice website said that urgent calls as well as routine calls had to go through the online system. An FAQ document from NHSEnglandstates that the online “consultation tool” was primarily for “non-urgent appointment requests, medication queries and admin requests”.The NHS acknowledges that sometimes, practices might choose to refer urgent cases through the form, “but patients with urgent needsshould still call their GP practice or attend in person”. Dr Amanda Doyle, the national director for primary care and community services at NHS England, said: “This is unacceptable – GP practices must keep their premises, telephone lines and online consultation tools open from 8am until 6.30pm, as part of their contractual requirements.”I’m sure most GP practices will abide by the founding principle of the online form being a) an option and b) mainly for non-urgent appointments. But for those that don’t, the impact will be deadly. The NHS must clarify its position that the online booking system is an option, an extra choice, and that it is meant for non-urgent appointments. Practices that tell patients it is a replacement system must be penalised.Share your experienceHave you had a similar experience?

The receptionist said she would make an exception for me. Which made me more furious than if they’d simply turned me away. After all, doctors are now contractually obliged now to provide patients with access through three routes – online, via phone and in person.The doctor looked delighted when I told her that the new system was disastrous. She couldn’t agree more, she said. I told her why it didn’t work for me and how the practice was misusing the system, but before I finished she appeared to have lost interest and was gesturing me to the door. I asked her why she thought it was disastrous. “We’re getting too many referrals,” she said.Just before this article was published, the surgery got in touch to tell me that it was amending its website to make clear that patients can still make appointments by phone or in person.Simon Hattenstone is a features writer for the GuardianExplore more on these topicsNHSOpinionDoctorsHealthWes StreetingEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

But for this guide, I tried seven more palatable experiences to suit a range of tastes, ages and budgets: experiences that felt unusual but that your recipient might actually enjoy – and some (as I did with life drawing) they might want to take up as a hobby. Most experiences were local to me in London, but all activities selected have alternatives nationwide, of which we’ve listed a few below.The best experience gifts for ChristmasImmersive theatreView image in fullscreenExpect to get your dancing shoes on at the Lost Estate.Photograph: Victoria Richards/The GuardianIf, like me, your recipient loves any excuse to dress up and century-hop for a while, then I have the activity for you. Immersive theatre has gained a lot of traction in recent years, with large-scale productions such asSecret Cinemaallowing us to prance about like we’ve got a bit-part in movies such as Grease.Now we have the Lost Estate. This interactive theatre experience in Earl’s Court yanked me back a few decades to tropical Havana, with the help of some excellent live Latin music, impressive dance sequences (some performed by professionals, others where dancers and waiting staff encouraged us to join in), a lively retelling of Cuban myths and legends – and more than a few frozen daquiris.It was fun, silly and ended up with my date and me doing the conga at four in the afternoon (a win all round, even if it did feel a bit like being on a cruise ship). Tickets are pretty pricey – and the food definitely isn’t the bit you’ll remember – but I’d wholeheartedly recommend any of the Lost Estate experiences if you want to impress a new romantic partner, or do something a bit escapist with friends or family.Paradise Under the Stars (set in Havana) ran until the end of September, but tickets are now available for 58th Street (set in jazz-age New York), which runs into 2026. And the Chat Noir! cabaret, set in 1890s Paris, opens in March 2026. I’m going to dig out that corset …Give this gift to …a new romantic prospect, a family member who needs a bit of escapism, your work wife/husband.I tried:The Lost Estate, Earl’s Court, London, from £69.50ppAlternatives:Motown supper immersive dining and live showfor two (available in London, Manchester and Birmingham), £122,Virgin Experience Days;City of Spies immersive espionage experience, Whitehall, London, £226,WonderDays.Life drawing classView image in fullscreenReaffirming a love of the human body could be priceless.Photograph: Adrian DuttonI hadn’t realised there were quite so many ways to draw someone naked. Fromneon life drawingtodrag life drawing, the options for capturing someone in the buff are now endless.Still, I was nervous about sitting in a hall with 20 strangers as someone walked in and disrobed – until I did it. And something amazing happened.Far from giggling, blushing or offending the model with my terrible sketching, which I haven’t done since A-level art, I was influenced by everyone around me, who took it seriously. And what I produced in an hour using the charcoals and pencils provided was – well, if not objectively good, then at least passable. I felt artistic! It was deeply absorbing, and nice to exercise the creative side of my brain.The class reaffirmed my love of the human body – yes, even my own.Give this gift to …anyone in their 40s and 50s who’s dealing with the existential crisis that comes with ageing: forget Botox – try life drawing, instead.I tried:London life drawing, Bethnal Green, London, £13Alternatives:Bristol private life drawing class workshop, Bristol, from £35pp,Experience Days;life drawing workshop, Manchester, £16-20;Sheffield male life drawing, from £29.50pp;life drawing party in Leeds, £25ppA head spaView image in fullscreenGive the gift of pure bliss.Photograph: Victoria Richards/The GuardianYou’ve probably never wondered what your scalp looks like magnified and projected on to a screen. Yet this is how my treatment began – a closeup of my follicles and the “problem areas” we’d be aiming to tackle. Thankfully, there was nothing too sinister to report – so I opted for the relaxing lavender face mist and a hydrating head massage with conditioning treatment, as part of a 90-minute “ultimate” head spa.There was hair washing, a facial, a hand and arm massage, an insanely great twisty-rolly machine (I had my eyes closed so I don’t know what was going on up there on my head), and as soon as that was over, it was time for the metal-spider-plungey-contractor (scalp massager) that made every single nerve in my head tingle. Delicious. Finally, I was left to relax in the spa before being treated to a posh blow-dry and an impromptu analysis of my dating life (she was right, by the way, I’m glad I dumped him).This is, to put it clumsily, a very posh, very pricey hair wash: like when you go to the hairdresser and you wish they’d wash it for longer, because it feels divine to have someone massaging your scalp.To say it’s a luxury would be an understatement.Give this gift to …the person in your life who has everything.I tried:the head spa at Cloud Twelve, Notting Hill, London, from £245Alternatives:Ultimate head spa, Lee Marston hotel, Birmingham, vouchers available, £100;head spa day, the Abbey hotel, Redditch, vouchers available, £135Burlesque dance classView image in fullscreenGlow for it!Photograph: Victoria Richards/The GuardianI don’t remember exactly what our effervescent instructor Julie Jade said during our burlesque dance routine, because a) my friend and I had drunk two cocktails beforehand and b) I was focusing very hard on trying not to fall over, having been gifted with two left feet. But I do recall we were all “gorgeous creatures” and “naughty boys”, there to pucker our lips, wiggle, shake and flap our paper fans in front of our faces like Dita Von Teese.What I hadn’t realised was what a workout the class would be. We would have been sweating, except that in the burlesque world, women don’t sweat – they glow. I learned an entire, choreographed dance routine for the first time in my life – and somehow, unthinkably, felt sexy doing it. An absolute win. I will definitely go back – I might even sign up for a whole course.Give this gift to …your best friend (and go with them).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

I put my foot on the gas and crept forward at dazzling speeds of … 30mph. I was too scared to go any faster, but it was a beautiful drive: the machinery, the precision and responsiveness of the car – the slightest tap on the gas and it was raring to go.As someone who doesn’t even like theme parks, thrill-seeking of the “drive really fast” kind wasn’t high on my wishlist, but I do feel cool now I’ve done it, and have the pictures to prove it.Give this gift to …a thrill-seeker, a petrolhead, your dad.I tried:Ferrari driving experience and high speed passenger ride, at North Weald driving centre, Essex, from £89Alternatives:Supercar driving experience, in 20 locations including Brands Hatch, Canterbury, Devon, Dunsfold, Lochgelly, Tockwith, Wigan, Oxfordshire, North Weald, Leicestershire, Curborough, Sywell and Aldershot, from £34.99;Ferrari v Lamborghini passenger ride, available at 22 locations, £179,Virgin Experience Days;the Ultimate four-car Ferrari driving experiencefor one, available at 22 locations including Brands Hatch, Lichfield, Elvington, Pembrey, Wareham, Three Sisters, Derby and Snetterton Circuit, £119.99Wizard afternoon tea and potion-makingView image in fullscreenA ‘magical’ experience gift for Harry Potter fans.Photograph: Victoria Richards/The Guardian“This place really is magical,” my nine-year-old son breathed as we arrived for our wizard afternoon tea at the Georgian House hotel in Victoria, London. And it was – although the most magical part for me was being given pointy black hats to wear, which I insisted we keep on for the entire day.I was provided with a “potion set” that contained several test tubes of colour-changing liquids, one of which (for me) was gin. The kids got “goblin goo” (DIY bubble tea) and “werewolf fur” (candyfloss), which we mixed into some goblets (which were so pretty that I then spent the next five minutes trying to find them on Google – and telling my daughter I’d like some for Christmas). Then it was time to get stuck in to the tea itself: miniature egg mayonnaise and cream cheese sandwiches, salmon and avocado mousse canapes, an array of miniature cakes and desserts, scones with clotted cream, jam with popping candy … oh, my!What made this experience really special – aside from the standout dry ice cauldron that welcomed us to the table – was that they went above and beyond to cater for our diets: no butter on the sandwiches, thanks, and my son only eats Marmite. A rare family outing where everyone came away happy – and full up.The all-important review? “Fun – really fun,” my Harry Potter-obsessed son said.Give this gift to …your kids, nieces, nephews, grandchildren or wannabe wizards of any age.I tried:the Wizard Experience at the Georgian House hotel, London, gift vouchers available, from £20 (kids) to £40 (adult) – potion-making extra (from £20pp)Alternatives:the Making of Harry Potter, Warner Bros studio tour, Watford, vouchers available, from £45 (child) to £56 (adult) or a family ticket (two adults, two children) £188;the Oxford Harry Potter tour, Oxford, from £75ppGong bathAnd relax …To say I was cynical about gong baths would be correct, because I’ve never been much of a believer in activities you might file under “woo-woo”. But then, I’d never had a gong bath – also known as a sound bath – before. What I discovered, once I lowered my sceptical eyebrows and gave it a chance, was that modern life doesn’t give much room to stop and rest.It’s “normal” to race around madly from work to school pick-ups to exercise classes to that dinner with friends you really wish you’d cancelled months ago. So the idea of taking an hour out – with 20 strangers, while someone talks about how the vibrations can do “magical things” because the human body is mostly made of water and the gongs can pick up on that – is laughable.That’s why I’m so glad I did it. Sure, it was weird, woo-woo and well out of my comfort zone to lie still and listen to a giant cymbal crashing in my ears (and half the class when they started snoring), but it did lure me into a sort of hypnotic state. Afterwards, I can only describe the feeling I had as “zen”.If you want to get someone a relaxing gift that feels a bit different from a massage – and is marginally more affordable – then this is a great option.Give this gift to …a friend or family member who needs to switch off, or yourself.I tried:theAkasa deep connection and relaxation gong bath, London, from £23.46Alternatives:Farm Club yoga and sound bath serenity session for two, Cheshire, £50,Virgin Experience Days;the Sound Alchemist 1:1 sound therapy session, Knaresborough, Yorkshire, from £50;Sound Spa, Amersham, £18,private 60-minute sound bath, Middlesex, £60.For more, read theChristmas gifts that Filter readers have loved the mostand thebest Christmas gifts for 2025Victoria Richards is a freelance columnist, opinion editor and agony aunt.

Demob happy. A few minutes in to the year’s penultimate prime minister’s questions with MPs from both sides shouting and cheering, the speaker interrupted proceedings to say: “We don’t need the panto auditions any more.” To which the natural response was: “Ooh yes we do.” Because that’s pretty much the whole purpose ofPMQsat the best of times. A feelgood experience for some. A feelbad experience for others. Noise with no substance.No one embraces the panto spirit more thanKemi Badenoch. Kemi has come to realise that the bar is actually quite low for her to remain as Tory leader. All she has to do is be a little bit better than Keir Starmer at PMQs. Which is turning out to be a lot less difficult than she imagined. Sometimes just standing up is enough.Though being good at PMQs does nothing to shift the polls – the Tories are still tanking behind Labour – it does wonders for the morale of her backbenchers. And they are the men and women keeping her in a job. If you had suggested that Kemi might last longer than Keir just six months ago, you would have got long odds. But now she’s an odds on favourite. It’s still unlikely she will be Tory leader at the next election, but that’s a long way off. And Kemi isn’t that bothered. She’s happy to bank whatever wins she can get. For almost the first time in her life, her confidence is not entirely misplaced.Credit also to Kemi’s minders. Somehow they have managed to steer her away from her late-night browsing of far-right conspiracy theories on the dark web. Instead they have instructed here to try to keep it simple at PMQs. By all means adopt some cutesy Cinders panto repartee if you must. But play the questioning straight. Stick to the basics of, “how are things going?”. Because the reality is that most people think the answer is, “badly verging on terribly”. There’s only so long a prime minister can carry on blaming the other party. People expected things to have noticeably changed by now.So that’s what Kemi did. Took a few potshots at Starmer being a caretaker leader and then cherrypicked her way through areas of health, education, policing and energy on which Labour were weak. Job done. This was politics 101 for any opposition leader. Keir could only sound defensive in reply. Try to imply that Kemi’s job was also on the line when everyone knows it’s his backbenchers who are having the change of leadership chats. His cabinet ministers eyeing up the perfect time to make a move. The country doesn’t much care whether Kemi comes or goes. That’s her blessing and her curse.View image in fullscreenIf Keir couldn’t commit to closer economic ties with Europe, Ed doubted he would still be standing at the dispatch box this time next year.Photograph: House of Commons/PAStarmer could only hope for damage limitation. Some days you win, some you lose. This was always going to be one of the latter days. Right now Keir is living his worst life. Deep-rooted problems in the economy and his own party turning on him. Nothing to be done other than adopt full-on survival mode and hope to catch a break some time soon. As for this PMQs, it would soon be yesterday’s social media fodder. The Westminster bubble were the only people who cared and they would soon move on to the next crisis.But Keir did not come off unscathed. Though it wasn’t Kemi who inflicted the wounds that really hurt. It was the ever so polite Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader who would never resort to panto in the chamber, who cut Starmer to the quick. Kemi could not go near Donald Trump’s latest rants on Europe – she is far too invested in staying close to the far right in-crowd – but Davey could. And did. Why the silence on the new US security strategy? Did the prime minister appreciate the irony of Agent Orange talking about Europe trampling on democratic principles? Any comments on “civilisational erasure”?Nothing. Starmer couldn’t bring himself to say a word against the US president. Couldn’t believe that everyone who had told him The Donald was uber fickle and that his support could not be counted on were correct. Couldn’t defend Sadiq Khan from Trump’s grotesque racism. Would rather say nothing and let the Russians believe Europe was a pushover.Davey went on to ask about closer economic ties with the EU. If Keir couldn’t commit to that then Ed rather doubted the prime minister would still be standing at the dispatch box this time next year.Et tu, Ed?He could take that sort of line from Kemi any day of the week. She calls for him to resign almost on a daily basis. Sometimes twice on the same day for different things. Keir is often unsure whether he is meant to unresign and then resign again. But to hear it from Gentleman Ed was too much to bear. More in sorrow than in anger.It wasn’t just Starmer who was having a bad day.Rachel Reeveshad her own ordeal to face in the guise of a 90-minute appearance before the Treasury select committee to answer questions on the budget. The main focus was on the process. How come so much of the budget was leaked in advance? In fact all of it, even down to the bits that had been planned and then dropped. It had been as if the whole country had been on a Zoom call with Starmer and Reeves during the build up.Keir Starmer appoints 25 Labour peers in bid to strengthen support in House of LordsRead moreRachel was horrified by all the leaks. No one was more horrified than her. It turned out there were key differences between leaks and briefings. Briefings were leaks that were authorised. Leaks were unauthorised leaks. Though it was all so long ago she couldn’t remember which bits were leaks and which bits were briefings. So she would be setting up an inquiry to investigate which leaks she had leaked and which she had briefed. Confused? She was. But the inquiry would run in parallel to the one Keir was conducting into what Keir had leaked to the media about the leadership challenge leaks.Thankfully for Rachel, the questioning moved on to growth. It was there even if you can’t measure it, she said. It was just her luck to have delivered a budget that had proved a big hit with both her leftwing backbenchers and the financial markets, but been rubbished by almost everyone else.

Her facilitator reveals why her victory is so seismic – and the secrets of her party playlistWed 10 Dec 2025 12.22 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 13.04 ESTShareThe morning after theTurner prizeceremony, the winner of the UK’s most prestigious art award, Nnena Kalu, is eating toast and drinking a strong cup of tea. Everyone around her is beaming – only a little the worse for wear after dancing their feet off at the previous night’s party in Bradford, and sinking “a couple of brandies” back at the hotel bar. I say hello to Kalu, offer my congratulations, and admire the 59-year-old’s beautifully manicured creamy pink nails. But the interview is with her facilitator, Charlotte Hollinshead, who has worked with the artist since 1999. Kalu has limited verbal communication skills; she has learning disabilities and is autistic.As for Hollinshead, she is struggling to encapsulate the enormity of the win: for Kalu herself; forActionSpace, the organisation that has supported her for 25 years; and for the visibility and acceptance of artists with learning disabilities within the wider art world. “It’s unbelievably huge,” she says. “I have to think back to where we started, when there was absolutely no interest whatsoever. I’d sit at dinner parties with friends in the art world. Nobody was interested in what I did, or who we worked with. We couldn’t get any exhibitions anywhere. No galleries were interested. Other artists weren’t interested. Art students weren’t interested. We have had to claw our way up from the very depths of the bottom.”View image in fullscreenShimmering forms … a videotape piece in the Turner prize show.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe previous night, in her speech on behalf of Kalu, she described the win as “seismic”. Kalu’s exhibition – which wastippedto win by Guardian art critic Adrian Searle – leaps out joyously at the Turner prize show at Bradford’sCartwright Hall Art Gallery. First the sculptures hit the eye – bulbous, bulging, shimmering multicoloured forms that snake and pretzel into themselves. They are built in layers of materials, wrapped and bound, bundled and draped in tape, ribbon, mesh, plastic. Videotape, one of Kalu’s favoured materials, dances and shimmers in a draught too faint to feel against your skin. Second, you are pulled into the drawings, which are all diptychs and triptychs, the pairs and trios near-echoes of each other. Whorls and spirals express the artist’s precise bodily range, the reach of her arm: you can feel how human they are. I’ve seen a film of her working and the regular sweep-swoosh of the crayon or pencil on paper in its rhythmic flow is something beautiful to hear. The spiral shapes she often creates are like cochleas or the deep interiors of shells, receding into a darkened blue-black vortex at the centre.I’m curious to know how Hollinshead works with Kalu in thestudio. She puts to rest one misconception: Kalu is not non-verbal. She tends not to speak in a large group, says Hollinshead. But one-on-one, absolutely she does. Hollinshead tells me that earlier, in the lift down to their hotel breakfast, they’d been discussing the playlist for a celebration that’s being planned in London to mark the win. Kalu listed off, Hollinshead tells me: “The Bee Gees, Donna Summer, Stevie Wonder, Abba, Hot Chocolate.”Kalu works between two and four days a week in the studio. “She’ll tell me what colours she wants, what materials she wants,” says Hollinshead. “It’s my job to get all that ready for her and lay them out. We always call it her ‘buffet’. She dips in and out with whatever she wants to work with.” Kalu has echolalia – she often repeats what is said to her – “but you give her space, you give her time, and then she says what’s on her mind,” says Hollinshead.Kalu is very clear about when her works on paper are finished (many artists would give a lot for that particular sense of clarity). “The biggest part of my job,” says Hollinshead, “is watching her as well as listening and making sure that we’re always responding to her needs, that we’re not manoeuvring her and that we’re not pushing her in a direction, but we’re just sensitively ensuring that she’s got everything she needs to do what she wants to do.”The big sculptures are a slightly different thing: “She has reworked loads and loads of pieces, building them up to the point now where they become completely gargantuan, unruly pieces of art.” Usually, for a show, she’ll finish them in the exhibition space, which she did in Bradford, sometimes upending what curators had expected. But, as Hollinshead points out, that’s pretty normal for any artist working on a show.Hollinshead is clear about the long-term purpose she has had through the 30 years she has worked withActionSpace, which, aside from Kalu, supports dozens of other artists with learning disabilities. She wants the artists to be seen maturely as part of the contemporary art world, in the mainstream of its institutions. For her, it has been a case of the art world catching up with Kalu’s capabilities, not the other way around.View image in fullscreen‘A life commitment to the work’ … Kalu adding the finishing touches to a sculpture.Photograph: Jules Lister/Courtesy of Humber Street Gallery and the artist“Nnena was ready for this quite a few years ago, but everybody else wasn’t,” she says. And if Kalu has finally breached what Hollinshead called, in her acceptance speech, “a very stubborn glass ceiling”, there are many who have been totally overlooked.“We’ve got a whole storage unit filled with two decades of amazing art waiting for a massive ActionSpace retrospective. It breaks my heart that so many of those people didn’t have their moment in the limelight,” she says. “I’m so happy that this has happened while Nnena is all guns blazing, while she can really enjoy it. She does understand what’s happening. She really does – and it’s utterly, properly joyous.”I’m intrigued by Hollinshead’s determination to break down the barriers to the art world, perhaps because Kalu’s work, her very way of being, poses a challenge to so much of what is considered important in that world. The art world is, paradoxically for a visual art form, very concerned with the verbal: with artists talking about their work, explaining it, despite the fact that doing so is often a struggle for the artists themselves and not especially illuminating for audiences.“I have been told explicitly that Nnena wouldn’t be able to have an art career because she couldn’t conceptualise her practice and share it,” says Hollinshead.She couldn’t give a toss about the art world, but she does care about exhibitionsThe art world is also structured around questions of value and the market that seem not to impinge much on Kalu – she is obviously deeply invested in making her work, but it doesn’t seem as if she cares much about the outer trappings.“She couldn’t give a toss about the art world,” agrees Hollinshead, “but what she does care about is putting exhibitions together. If we want to do more exhibitions, and for them to be really big and juicy and have a budget so she can let rip and do her thing, we need to play the game a bit. And I think last night we did turn the art world upside down a little.”It has been a slow, incremental road to mainstream acceptance for Kalu. Hollinshead talks of the early years, when the only exhibitions available for her and other artists with learning disabilities were in the town hall and libraries in the London borough of Wandsworth, where their work together began. A turning point for Kalu was being invited to make a solo show as part ofGlasgow Internationalin 2018 (the city where she was born, of Nigerian parents, in 1966). “It was the first time curators and gallery directors and other artists came and saw the work,” says Hollinshead.An exhibition in Hull followed – a solo show atHumber Street Gallery. Hollinshead laughs as she tells me about observing a man watching Kalu at work and then returning with his son, a student at Glasgow School of Art. “The man told his son: ‘Look:thatis an artist.Thatis a life commitment to the work.’”View image in fullscreen‘Unruly pieces’ … part of an exhibition in Barcelona in 2024.Photograph: Ivan Erofeev/Courtesy of Manifesta 15 Barcelona MetropolitanaThis year Kalu had herfirst solo exhibition overseas, at Kunsthall Stavanger. Hollinshead is still pinching herself. “We took a woman with really complex learning disabilities to Norway to install her solo show. I mean, that’s unheard of, for a UK artist. It really is groundbreaking stuff.”Hollinshead is still wearing a rosette on her jumper that all team Kalu were sporting the previous evening – in its centre a cheery photo of the artist and the words, “Idol, legend, winner, whatever”. They are a quotation from one of the participants in a workshop that Kalu led recently. Hollinshead tells me her ActionSpace colleagues have been flooded today with messages from day centres and special educational needs schools. “I think the ripple effects of this are going to be massive,” she says. “Schools are doing art projects based on Nnena. All these students are wrapping and drawing; we’re being sent pictures by teachers.”She tells me about a visit they made this week to a special educational needs unit at a mainstream school in Bradford. Kalu got stuck in with the kids who were making wrapped sculptures. Hollinshead pulls out a picture: it shows a little girl, with Down’s syndrome, embracing Kalu’s leg. Apparently she stayed there for the duration of the session. This week’s win for Kalu may be a watershed moment for the art world, a redefinition of what is regarded as valuable and worthy of its highest accolades. But maybe the real significance of it lies in what it might one day mean for little girls like this.The Turner prize is atCartwright Hall Art Gallery, Bradford, until 22 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTurner prizeArtAwards and prizesinterviewsShareReuse this content"

For example, the focus right now is on migrants, in large part. But who is it going to be about next time around? ”O’Flaherty said it is “very important” that politicians point out the significance of the ECHR’s core principles, such as that people are equal in terms of the universality of human rights.“The idea that we would create or foster the impression of a hierarchy of people, some more deserving than others, is a very, very worrying one indeed,” he said.11:40Will weakening human rights really stop the far right? | The LatestHis comments come after some of Europe’s hardline governments including the UKmoved a step closer to “constraining” human rights lawsto allow Rwanda-style migration deals with third countries and more foreign criminals to be deported.Twenty-seven of the 46 Council of Europe members including the UK, Hungary and Italy signed an unofficial statement that also urges a new framework for the European convention of human rights, which will narrow the definition of “inhuman and degrading treatment”.The statement follows a meeting of the council in Strasbourg on Wednesday as part of a push to change the way the laws apply in migration cases.Signed by 27 countries, the statement said that article 3 of the convention, which bans “inhuman or degrading treatment”, should be “constrained to the most serious issues in a manner which does not prevent states parties from taking proportionate decisions on the expulsion of foreign criminals … including in cases raising issues concerning healthcare and prison conditions”.It also argues that article 8 should be “adjusted” in relation to criminals so that more weight is put on the nature and seriousness of the offence committed and less on a criminal’s ties with the host country.Can weakening human rights ever protect them? Labour’s gamble raises fears on the leftRead moreThe council has resolved to reconvene in May to make a declaration – a political statement reaffirming commitments or guiding principles, carrying significant political weight but not legally binding in itself.Declarations from the council are intended to have an effect on case law and on European court rulings.However, it may be possible for a two-thirds majority, or 31 members, to force through a decision that would give their views of interpretations of articles 3 and 8, sources have said.Senior Labour figures have expressed concern at the plans. Lord Alf Dubs, the Labour peer who came to the UK on the Kindertransport in 1939, said: “I’m worried it will be the thin edge of the wedge and just about taking human rights away from people. Obviously a lot of this will be in the detail and how it’s interpreted, but I’m alarmed and concerned that 27 countries are ganging up to do this in Europe to their citizens.”Baroness Shami Chakrabarti, a human rights barrister, said: “To ‘reinterpret’ or justify inhuman and degrading treatment is to strike at the very heart of postwar rights and freedoms.”Veronika Fikfak, a professor of international law at University College London, said the proposed changes to article 3 will be of concern for people who are arrested for protesting or held in detention in dire conditions.“To be allowed to expel a handful of criminals, states are today embarking on a path that will reduce human rights protections for all of Europe. This reinterpretation will not primarily affect migrants, but those who need medical attention and those who find themselves in harsh prison conditions. The move seems to be disproportionate and set us on a dangerous path,” she said.Akiko Hart, director of the human rights organisation Liberty, warned the government “risks taking us down a road of no return by jeopardising the legal framework that protects us all”.“These discussions must be rooted in facts and evidence, not exaggerated narratives and the demonisation of our communities,” she said.Others have offered their support for the proposals. The former Labour cabinet minister Lord Hain said: “I’d be opposed to pulling out of the ECHR, that would leave Britain deeply isolated and discredited, but finding a way of curbing the excesses of the Strasbourg court in a sensible fashion – which is quite feasible within the treaty and the act – is a much more creative way to do that.”It also emerged on Wednesday that a senior government minister has declined to rule out “pushing back” small boats in the Channel.In an interviewwith Politico, Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, was asked if the government would consider taking up an offer by Jordan Bardella, the leader of France’s far-right National Rally, to conduct “pushbacks” of migrant boats in the Channel if his party wins power.When asked if pushback was not “totally off the table”, Cooper – who was until recently home secretary – replied: “We will look at any mechanism that can work effectively and also can work safely.”Labour, unlike the Tories and Reform UK, is committed to remaining within the ECHR, which was drawn up in the aftermath of the second world war.Labour’s poll ratings have plummeted since the general election, with the rise of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK partly attributed to concerns about the impact of immigration – both authorised and through small boat crossings of the Channel.Explore more on these topicsEuropean court of human rightsKeir StarmerCouncil of EuropeHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

It promised it would cancel the five-day stoppage due to start on 17 December if that was what those taking part wanted.The strike has caused huge alarm across anNHSthat is struggling to deal with a record number of people for the time of year in a hospital bed with flu – 1,700 – and a growing number of hospitals having to declare a “critical incident” because they cannot cope.Sir Jim Mackey, the chief executive of NHS England, last weekcriticised next week’s industrial actionas “cruel and calculated to cause mayhem at a time when the service is pulling out all the stops” in the run-up to Christmas when it comes under intense pressure.Interviewing future medical students gave me that rare thing: hope for the NHS | Devi SridharRead moreStreeting has doubled from 2,000 to 4,000 the number of specialist training places he is pledging that the NHS in England will create to try to unblock a “bottleneck” that has developed in recent years and led to thousands of doctors being unable to progress their careers. He will table emergency legislation in January to make the change.The government’s 10-year health plan proposed only an extra 1,000 training places a year but Streeting doubled that to 2,000 last month in an offer that the BMA rejected out of hand.Competition among doctors to secure a training place has intensified sharply in the last few years as up to 30,000 doctors a year chase as few as 10,000 places.The BMA said Streeting’s much improved offer proved that striking does help doctors achieve their goals.“This offer is the result of thousands of resident doctors showing that they are prepared to stand up for their profession and their future. It should not have taken strike action but make no mistake: it was strike action that got us this far,” said Jack Fletcher, the chair of the BMA’s resident doctors committee.Streeting accompanied his offer with renewed criticism of next week’s planned five-day strike. “I cannot understand the wilful casualness with which the BMA’s leadership have chosen to inflict this pain on patients, other staff and the NHS itself. It is one of the most shameful episodes in the long history of the BMA,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They have withdrawn their labour for a total of 49 days. The BMA will announce the result of the survey on Monday 15 December.Daniel Elkeles, the chief executive of the hospitals group NHS Providers, said: “This offer shows the government has been listening to genuine training concerns raised by the BMA and has come up with a constructive, sensible, and we hope, decisive solution.“The NHS is coming under enormous operational pressure and the possibility of further industrial action next week is a huge worry, particularly as we’re facing a tidal wave of flu.”Rory Deighton, the acute care director at the NHS Confederation, said: “It is very pleasing that the BMA is considering this new offer from the government to end this long-running dispute and potentially avert hugely disruptive strikes next week.“These strikes would come at the worst possible time, with rapidly rising flu levels putting huge strain on hospitals, and despite NHS leaders working incredibly hard to prepare, we are concerned it could put patient safety at risk.“These strikes are disproportionate given the generous pay rises resident doctors have already had. We would urge resident doctors to seriously consider this offer, which aims to address access to specialty training places and concerns over exam and membership fees.”Explore more on these topicsDoctorsIndustrial actionNHSHospitalsHealthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

At least six hospitals across the UK have told patients to stay away due to a surge in flu cases sweeping the country this week.Daniel Elkeles, the chief executive of NHS Providers,said on Tuesdaythat “if you are coughing and sneezing, but you’re not unwell enough to not go to work, you must wear a mask when you’re in public spaces, including on public transport”. His comments received widespread coverage.But health experts told the Guardian his advice could undermine public faith in official guidance from government bodies such as the UKHealthSecurity Agency (UKHSA), which says people should “consider” wearing a mask in such circumstances.“One thing we learned from Covid is how important it is that messages from health authorities and governments are clear and aligned,” said Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist and public health researcher at Swansea University.“When people receive conflicting, unclear or mixed messages about health advice, such as when to wear masks, this can be confusing for people and can undermine the messages.”NHS braces for ‘unprecedented flu wave’ as hospitalised cases in England riseRead moreWilliams added this could also prompt “alert fatigue”, where the public “ultimately get confused by, or switched off from health advisories”. Another risk is that the difference in language could be used by those spreading misinformation online “to make false statements”.Ultimately, wearing a mask in indoor crowded spaces was “a good idea” when cases of flu were high and rising – “particularly if you yourself have symptoms of the flu”, Williams said. But detail in health advice from officials still mattered, he added.“There is a big difference between saying that people ‘must’ wear masks and [that] they are ‘recommended’ to wear them.”Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, voiced similar concerns. “In public health … one of the biggest problems with miscommunication is if experts disagree. So if you’ve got people arguing different things, that undermines the message, whatever it is.”He added: “If people who are allegedly representing the consensus view, or are perceived by others to be part of that official view, then giving advice which conflicts actually undermines the advice full stop.“It always causes confusion. It’s not just me saying that – there’s research to support that going back decades.”Hunter said mixed messaging on masks also risked creating confusion over vaccines.“It undermines not only that advice [on flu and masks] but more general advice. You know … ‘If the experts can’t agree about whether or not we have to wear masks, what about their advice on vaccines?’”NHS Providers is a trade body that represents the 204 health trusts in England and speaks for the senior managers who run them, but is not part of the health service itself.Last week Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, a consultant epidemiologist at UKHSA, said if someone had flu-like symptoms and needed to go out while unwell, they could “consider wearing a face mask”.Asked about Elkeles’s remarks yesterday, No 10 said there were different measures people “can consider taking to help limit the spread of winter bugs if they have flu-like symptoms.” That was “neither new nor an instruction, but simply something people can consider when trying to limit the spread of winter respiratory illnesses”.When asked if they endorsed Elkeles’s view that those with flu symptoms “must wear” a face mask, other NHS and health organisations distanced themselves.Rory Deighton, the director of acute care at the NHS Confederation, which also represents trusts, and with which NHS Providers is merging next year, pointed to the UKHSA’s advice, saying: “There are a range of sensible measures that people can take to help to reduce the spread of flu, including getting vaccinated I they are eligible and either staying at home if they feel unwell or wearing a mask if they have to go outdoors.”Prof Mumtaz Patel, the president of the Royal College of Physicians, did not offer a view on masks and instead urged people, including NHS staff, to get vaccinated against flu.More and more hospitals are asking staff, patients and visitors to wear a mask in at least some wards to combat flu.“Some hospitals have introduced mask wearing on certain wards, such as A&E, intensive care units, oncology and renal dialysis services where the risk is higher,” Deighton said. “As rates of flu continue to rise, we expect this to continue.”Explore more on these topicsFluHealthNHSHealth policyPublic services policyHealthcare industryInfectious diseasesShareReuse this content"

The school will never open because of lack of demand, forcing the DfE to pull the plug late last year.Instead the DfE agreed with Nottingham city council to convert the building into a special school, as a satellite to the existing Rosehill special school, to provide more places for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send).A regional breakdown shows in London £55m was spent on eight free schools that closed or were “rebrokered”, where a school is moved from one academy trust to another. In the West Midlands, £16m was spent on two failed free schools, while 57 existing schools in the region were listed under the DfE’s rebuilding programme.Gove’s free schools increase segregation and harm nearby schools, says studyRead moreMeg Powell-Chandler, director of theNew Schools Network, argued that the programme had “injected new energy” into England’s school system, allowing fresh thinking and innovations by teachers and leaders.Powell-Chandler said: “Free schools now outperform other non-selective state schools from the phonics check to A-levels, raising standards, increasing choice and improving outcomes for hundreds of thousands of pupils.“We urge the government to move forward with the 44 mainstream projects that would transform education in many left-behind areas, as well as the stalled special and alternative provision schools needed to provide vital, high quality specialist places.”In October last year Bridget Phillipson announced thatplanning for the 44 schoolsapproved under the programme would be paused while the government carried out an evaluation of their value for money. A decision on their fate is expected soon.Explore more on these topicsFree schoolsDepartment for EducationSchool fundingSchoolsSchool building programmeAcademiesEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

We want to end the use of B&Bs by the end of the parliament.“It will take people having access to better temporary accommodation, increased social housing and so on. But I think we can do it. If we don’t manage it, no one will judge me as harshly as I’ll judge myself.”She said the latest figures from Shelter, which show that more than 380,000 people in England are now homeless, with a record 350,000 in temporary accommodation, demonstrate the scale of the challenge facing the government.“We’ve had people’s incomes being constrained and costs going up, and then austerity for town halls over the past decade and a half,” she said. “When the force and momentum of those three big challenges is so great, it’s going to take more than a year of a Labour government to turn that around – but we will.”Even as she launched the strategy, her government came under fire from campaigners and the Labour mayor for Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, for freezing housing benefit until at least 2026.Burnham told ITV News on Wednesday: “The Westminster world, because sometimes they pose as tough on benefits, [says]: ‘Let’s freeze local housing allowance.’“All that means is families in private rented accommodation see a growing gap between the rent that being has to pay and the level of support they’re getting from the system, and it gets bigger to the point where they’re made homeless and they have to present to the council.”Sarah Elliott, the chief executive of Shelter, said: “The failure to unfreeze local housing allowance rates will condemn thousands to another grim winter without a secure home. Even more people will find it impossible to either avoid or escape homelessness in the months ahead unless the government throws them a lifeline.”McGovern hit back however: “The root of this problem is not housing allowance, it is the private rented sector.“If we want to move forward on this issue, we have to get to the root cause of it, and that means building more homes and making sure that people have got sustainable incomes.”As part of the government’s homelessness strategy, ministers have pledged hundreds of millions of pounds to various schemes to improve temporary accommodation, including a £124m fund for more supported housing for people with complex needs.The cornerstone of the strategy is a proposed “duty to collaborate” law that would force public bodies to work together to ensure people are not released from prison or discharged from hospital on to the streets.It would for the first time set clear targets on this issue, including halving the number of people who become homeless on their first night out of prison, and ensuring no eligible person is discharged to the street after a hospital stay.But ministers have refused to raise housing benefit – something campaigners say is essential to reduce homelessness in the short term.Jasmine Basran, the head of policy and campaigns at the charity Crisis, said its research showed homelessness among people discharged from hospitals, prisons and other institutions had increased by 22% in the last year.“We see people who have been in hospital and still have medical needs, but are discharged on to the streets, and then have to deal with the trauma and dangers of rough sleeping on top of physical and mental health conditions that they simply can’t manage,” she said.“It is not a place to recover. It just means we see people cycling back into A&E because they haven’t got the care they need. And if you are homeless once you leave prison, you are much more likely to reoffend. So this approach is absolutely right.”David Robinson, the assistant director of operations at the housing association Riverside, said: “This is something we see all the time – lots of the people we help have previously been in prison, hospital or social care, and left the system without anywhere to go.“But the devil is in the detail and we need to know who is going to have to do this, what the timescale is, and what resources will be there to support them.”Explore more on these topicsHomelessnessHousingSocial exclusionPovertyLabourCommunitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

He is now calling for “responsible” litter enforcement.East Lindsey district council (ELDC) told the BBC the enforcement teams, who work on behalf of the authority, would “only approach individuals who have been seen committing environmental crime offences”.The story emerged in a Facebook post by his daughter Jane Fitzpatrick.She wrote: “Recently dad who has walking difficulties but does his best to walk every day around the boating lake, inhaled a small leaf that made him choke.“Dad has severe asthma and a heart condition, he managed to cough up the leaf and spit it out. (just the leaf).“He was immediately approached by the local enforcement officer who was incredibly rude to him told him he had violated the law by spitting and fined him £160 !!! Dad tried to explain but the guy wouldn’t listen, dad showed him the leaf and no spit but he still got fined £160 !!!!“On another walk a week or so later, dad stopped to wipe his nose, and took a Hankey out of his pocket.“Even before he could put his hankey back into his pocket he was tapped on the shoulder by another enforcement officer and asked what he had done with his tissue !!!! (so dad was being followed !!) the tissue was still in dad’s hand !”Marsh claimed he was reprimanded as he stopped for a rest while walking across the South Parade car park in February.He told the BBC: “As I was sitting there, a gale blew a big reed into my mouth. I spat it out and just as I got up to walk away two guys [enforcement officers] came up to me.”He added: “It was all unnecessary and all out of proportion.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The moment they were marking felt like a miracle: after more than five decades of brutality and repression, the Assad regime had fallen.A day later, however, the ripple effects ofwhat had happened2,000 miles away in Syria were laid bare. A dozen European statesannounced plansto suspend asylum applications from Syrians, in a show of how western statesare increasinglytreating refugees as transients. As the fall of Bashar al-Assad collided with politicians’ quest to beseen as taking a hard lineon migration, the lives of Syrians around the globe were plunged into uncertainty.In Austria, where Alshater had spent the past decade painstakingly rebuilding his life – learning German, upgrading his professional certifications and raising his family – the governmentsaidit had ordered a review of cases where asylum had been granted to Syrians and that a programme of “orderly repatriation and deportation” was being prepared.A year after fall of Assad, a divided Syria struggles to escape cycle of violenceRead more“It’s alarming and disappointing,” said Alshater, who heads the Free Syrian Community ofAustria, a group that supports Syrian newcomers and helps them build bridges with Austrian officials and the wider society. “And it’s a breach of trust, especially for those who have already built a life here.”In September 2024 he was one of dozens of Syrians whospent hours volunteeringto help clean up after torrential floods battered the small Austrian town of Kritzendorf. It was a small gesture of gratitude towards their new home, one also aimed at rebutting thefar-right’s rhetoricand disinformation on migrants.Months later, Austria became the first country in the EU totemporarily suspendfamily reunification for refugees, a decision that disproportionately affected Syrians. In July this year it became the first to seize on the fall of Assad toreturn a Syrianwith a criminal conviction to his birth country.Alshater said the government’s actions had caused “significant fear” among the nearly 100,000 Syrians in Austria, leaving some grappling with depression and anxiety.In neighbouring Germany, home to Europe’s largest Syrian diaspora, the chancellor, Friedrich Merz, hassaid he expectsmany of the nearly 1 million Syrians living in Germany to voluntarily return home.“There are now no longer any grounds for asylum inGermany, and therefore we can also begin with repatriations,” he said last month. Those who refused to return could face deportation “in the near future”, he said.His view clashed with the many employers, trade unions and business associations who pointed to the vital role that Syrians play in alleviating the country’s deep labour shortages, as well as reservations raised byhis own foreign minister.View image in fullscreenA flag hangs in the rear-view mirror of a car driven by Syrian man in Lübeck, Germany.Photograph: Zohra Bensemra/ReutersThe German Economic Institute said last year that about 80,000 Syrians worked in sectors plagued by shortages. This included more than 4,000 mechatronic technicians in the auto industry, about 2,470 dentists and dental hygienists, 2,260 childcare workers and 2,160 medical carers.The study also found that more than 5,000 Syrian doctors were fully employed in Germany and that their return could lead to “critical shortages” in medical services.The threat of deportations now dominates conversations among Syrians, said Anas Alakkad, a refugee who runs a startup that seeks to train migrants for the job market in Germany.“They are afraid that they will get deported,” Alakkad said. Others question whether it is worth learning the language, starting businesses or settling down. “For the refugees who arrived recently, they don’t know if they will be able to get residency, and even if they do, they’re not allowed to bring their families here. So they’re really frustrated,” he said.Governments’ push to return Syrians home have transformed how many in the community see the fall of Assad, said Ahed Festuk, a Syrian activist who moved to the US in 2015. “It’s really bittersweet,” she said. “It’s true that we got our home back, but we shouldn’t ignore the fact that our home has been destroyed completely.”In autumn, a World Bank reportdescribed the challengesof reconstructing Syria as “immense”, estimating that it would cost more than US$200bn (£150bn)Weeks later, Donald Trump’s administration said it hadended temporary deportation protectionsand work permits for more than 6,100 Syrians in the US. Last month a federal judgeblocked the order, leaving these Syrians in limbo.Festuk visited Syria in June and saw first-hand how the infrastructure was severely lacking, leaving the government struggling to provide basic services, such as electricity and potable water. While the situation has improved since then, violence continues to flare up sporadically. “So to add millions of people right now I think would be really challenging for the people, for the government and for the country itself,” Festuk said.View image in fullscreenSyrians arrive at Turkey’s Cilvegözü border gate to cross into Syria in December 2024.Photograph: Dilara Senkaya/ReutersShe was certain that many Syrians would eventually return, echoing a recent UN survey thatfoundthat more than 80% of refugees hoped to return to Syria one day. More than a million people – about 15% of the nearly 7 million refugees forced out of the country by the civil war – had already headed back to Syria in the past year.But Festuk called on countries to give them space to decide. “It’s still too early to force people,” said Festuk, who works for the New York-based Multifaith Alliance, which supports refugees and internally displaced people around the world.M Murat Erdoğan, a migration researcher who has studied the wave of Syrian arrivals in Turkey, said about 500,000 people last year returned to Syria from Turkey, which took inabout 4 million Syriansduring the war.“So far the voluntary return has been truly voluntary,” he said. “They were relatively ready to go back.”Others, however, had forged deep ties in Turkey: more than14,000 businesseshave been launched or co-launched by Syrians in the country since the war started. “It will not be easy,” Erdoğan said. “They work in Turkey, they have children in schools there or they have access to services in Turkey.”In recent years these roots have come up against ahardening of attitudestowards Syrians in some quarters. A 2023 presidential candidate vowed to send all Syrians home if he was elected.In the German town of Ostelsheim, population 2,500, Ryyan Alshebl listed the topics that dominate his day-to-day life: wind turbines, combating loneliness among elderly people, and land use planning. In 2023, eight years after he had arrived in Germany as a refugee, he was elected mayor of the municipality.View image in fullscreenRyyan Alshebl, the mayor of Ostelsheim, giving a press conference in Berlin in May 2023.Photograph: John MacDougall/AFP/Getty ImagesIt is a hint of the kind of integration achieved by many Syrians in the country, a feat that has been overshadowed by far-right efforts to turn migration into a political talking point. “People told me after the election that they had biased ideas about Syrian refugees, what they might look like or what they could do,” said Alshebl, whostood as a non-party candidatein the elections despite being a member of the German Greens.In the past year, since the fall of Assad, he said, the German government had created a “dangerous” expectation that Syrians would return – a promise that if not kept, he said, could push voters into the arms of the far right and pave the way for forced deportations.The view has left Alshebl calling for an approach that could strike a balance: allowing Syrians who have learned the language and joined the workforce to stay, while eventually deporting the minority who continue to rely on state assistance.“It is not an act of benevolence for Germany to say that those who are well integrated should stay,” he said. “Germany needs these people. But those who for whatever reason have not been able to gain a foothold so far must also be told in no uncertain terms that they cannot stay. That’s a legitimate deal, I would say.”Explore more on these topicsSyriaFall of Assad: one year onRefugeesMigrationAustriaGermanyTurkeyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Could they all fit into a floating mega-yacht, or is the group much bigger, possibly the size of a dazzling mega-rich city?Thanks to an inequality report out on Wednesday, we now have a snapshot of the size of the topmost layer floating above everyone else – the 0.001%.The report estimates there are 56,000 of these zero-point-zero-zero-one-ers,and if they gathered for a party, the group would fit into the seats of a medium-sized football stadium, such as Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium or the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.Poland’s National StadiumThese wealth hoarders mostly own hundreds of millions of euros, and the average person in the group has close to €1bn.But why is it important to visualise this? The report’s authors say the comparisons “will help illustrate just how concentrated the very top” is and serve as a reference to allow people to “grasp the magnitude of global inequality”.To do that, it is helpful to compare their wealth with everyone else’s. Global inequality is well known, and the report shows how the top 10% own 75% of all global wealth.Bar chartBut one of the starkest findings of the report is that the ultra-rich 0.001%control three times the wealth of the poorest half of humanity. Not only that, their wealth is growing at a faster rate – close to 5%, compared with 3.4%.It is very hard to compare these two sections of society, since the 0.001% is a relatively tiny number of 56,000, when compared with the 2.8 billion adults in the bottom 50%. It would take 50,000 stadiums to fit them.But to give an idea of the disparity, the image below shows how big the bottom half is. Each dot represents one stadium of 56,000 people.These people collectively own only a third of the wealth of the super-rich who would fit in the stadium above.About 50,000 dotsRead the full reporton how just 56,000 people control three times as much wealth as the entire poorest half of humanity.Explore more on these topicsThe super-richInequalityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereKatherine Butler, associate editor, EuropeWed 10 Dec 2025 10.30 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 10.32 ESTShareAlmost half of EU citizens regard Donald Trumpas an enemy of Europe, a new survey across nine countries revealed last week. The poll, conducted for the French debate platform Le Grand Continent, found that across Europe, Trumpism is considered “a hostile force”.The newUS foreign policydoctrine published by the White House on Friday will have heightened these respondents’ worst fears. The 30-page National Security Strategy landed like a bombshell in Europe. And citizens may have been out in front of their political leaders in figuring out what Trump’s worldview could mean for Europeans.The strategy outlines a radical shift away from the ethos underpinning the Atlantic alliance, the doctrine that has bound the US toEuropesince the second world war. The US, now frames the EU – the continent’s core political community – as a legitimate target for ideological warfare.Its most astonishing pivot is a threat to meddle directly to “cultivate resistance” in Europe and restore the supposedly lost national sovereignties of the EU’s ailing individual nations.This is not just the familiar threat to withdraw troops or demand that Europe shells out more money for its own defence. It suggests that theTrump administrationwants to help “patriotic” far-right parties to power, while legitimising racist conspiracy theories. It makes the extraordinary claim that Europe faces the risk of “civilisational erasure” if “non-European” immigration is allowed to continue.For the Dutch political scientist Cas Mudde, an expert in the far right, this strategy means Europe must count the US from now on as “a willing adversary”.Writing in the Guardian, Mudde said: “Perhaps now that it is published in an official document, European leaders will finally understand that ‘daddy’ is serious … The current US government believes that its national security is best served by the destruction of liberal democracy in Europe.”Trumpdoubled downon Tuesday, using an interview with Politico to again lay into “decaying” European nations and their “politically correct” leaders whose immigration policies were “destroying” their countries. He complained about Paris and London in particular: the problem, as he viewed it was that the French and British capitals were becoming less white, or,wrote the Guardian’s Peter Beaumont, that they are “not racist enough”.Coercive consequencesView image in fullscreenKeir Starmer gives a warm welcome to Volodymyr Zelenskyy outside 10 Downing Street.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesThe US military and political alliance with Europe is clearly in crisis.Inan opinion pieceon Monday, Georg Riekeles and Varg Folkman predicted that Washington will, as it draws back militarily, pull harder on other coercive levers to reshape Europe in the political direction the US wants. Not just on trade, either: as Mudde also noted, this could mean the US demanding protection for far-right free speech.One of the biggest questions to be asked, according toPaul Taylorof the European Policy Centre, is why there is such an unequivocal embrace of Russia but no mention of it as a threat. Is there a longer game involving pulling in Vladimir Putin to isolate China? Are influential US interests eyeing juicy business deals? Either way,the document was warmly welcomedby the Kremlin.Yet, European governments’ reaction (in public, at least) has been muted. Leaders have grovelled to Trump for so many months, desperate to keep him engaged in the defence ofUkraine– and to avoid any peace plan that won’t harm their security, too (or provoke another trade war) – that they seem immobilised from speaking up. Germany’s Friedrich Merz has gone the furthest, saying it underscored the need for a more independent European security policy.The White House’s efforts to bully Ukraine into a bad “peace” deal could be entering another treacherous phase. But Washington’s priority is not – the strategy made clear – a European security architecture that shields Ukraine from future Russian invasion. It is an “expeditious cessation of hostilities” and the desire to “reestablish strategic stability with Russia”.These words (coupled with the accusation that Europe is not interested in making peace with Putin) must have been the elephant in the room when Merz, Starmer and Emmanuel Macron hugged Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy closeat Downing Streeton Monday.In his interview the following day, Trump again threatened to cut Ukraine adrift if Zelenskyy does not “play ball” in the talks. Europe has been sidelined from direct involvement in the US-led negotiations, yet it has helped Ukraine to hold the line against a dangerous Trump-Putin carve-up. Kyiv is now running out of money however soEurope must urgently find billionsto keep Ukraine in the fight, either by using frozen Russian assets or joint borrowing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Merely hoping that Trump’s embracedrives a wedgebetween Europe’s leading far rlght parties is a risky strategy. As Timothy Garton Ash implored of the continent’s leadersin this column: “How much more clarity do you need?”Nathalie Tocci, director of the Italian Institute for International Affairs, believes that Europe has the means to stand on its own, even in the short-term, to defend Ukraine. “Europe can prevent Kyiv’s capitulation, if we jolt ourselves out of our learned helplessness and stop sucking up to Trump. It’ll be tough but we can do it.”Being heard to stand up to Trump right now might even put Europe’s centrist leaders in good stead with their anxious voters. Le Grand Continent’s survey also showed that 51% of Europeans believed, even before Putin’s chilling statement last week about being “ready for war right now with Europe”, thatthey too are in Moscow’s crosshairs.To receive the complete version of This Is Europe in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsThis is EuropeEuropeDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinUkraineRussianewslettersShareReuse this content"

He upgraded the shed at one point, to make it soundproof. One of the men who suffered at Smyth’s hands as a boy remembers bleeding for weeks after. Another says: “I honestly thought I was going to die.” Another says that despite the pain the worst part was afterwards, when Smyth would cover the boy’s bloodied body with his and nuzzle his sweaty face into the boy’s neck and give him butterfly kisses. In his nightmares it is “that draping” he relives.Smyth, who died in 2018, was also a husband, a father of three children, a respected barrister, a prominent Christian evangelist, a moral campaigner, a man deeply involved with Winchester College (where he would give talks about the law andAnglicanismand invite interested boys to his family home for further discussions over Sunday lunches) and with the Church of England. He ran the Iwerne Christian summer camps for boys in Dorset and Zimbabwe throughout the 70s and 80s. All of this gave him uncountable opportunities to indulge his sadism. One boy in his care, Guide Nyachuru, died. An accidental drowning, said Smyth. Nyachuru was a strong swimmer. His family remains convinced that their 16-year-old boy died as a result of abuse by Smyth and was placed in the water afterwards. Smyth succeeded in discrediting the lawyer who was set to prosecute him for culpable homicide and fled back to England.See No Evil, an immaculately made, deeply harrowing two-part documentary about the man a report (that came far too long after the fact) would say was probably the most prolific serial abuser ever associated with the Church of England, covers all this and more. The details from the men who remember him are viscerally upsetting, not just when they recount what happened in the shed but the quiet reflections in between. “He turned into someone whose intentions I couldn’t calculate,” says Andy Morse, a Wykehamist who suffered from terrible homesickness and was drawn to the charismatic visitor to the school who offered himself as a perfect father figure. He, his best friend, Mark Stibbe – an orphan by the time Smyth met him and sniffed out his vulnerability “like a pheromone” – and “Graham” talk with such eloquence and dignity through their mass of internal strife that it is humbling to witness.There were, as there so often are, chances to stop this diabolical predator over the course of his 35-year career of inflicting terrible harm under the guise of punishing boys for their sins and calling them back to the Lord. The story of Channel 4’s investigation into who knew what and when is interwoven with the testimony of survivors (though “Graham”, with unfailing politeness, says that he would prefer not to be referred to as such. “I know this is very contentious,” he says, “but I remain a victim. I am not sure I have or will ever come out the other side of this.”)The former archbishop of canterburyJustin Welbywas, as a young man, an instructor at the Iwerne camps at the same time as Smyth, but denies knowing anything that happened at the time. The independent Makin report later found that from at least July 2013 Welby, along with many other senior Church of England figures, were made aware of the severity of Smyth’s abuse, and that Welby “had a personal moral responsibility” to reassure himself that the matter was being pursued by authorities.See No Evil also takes in Smyth’s family’s experiences. Theirs was a household riven with dread, built round the command not to “dishonour” their father. Daughters Fiona and Caroline lived in fear of his temper and always knew, as Fiona puts it, that their father was “an unsafe grownup … always something ‘off’ about him”. Peter John, the only son and – his sisters used to tease him with this – the “golden boy”, lived to please his father and followed him into Christian ministry. His memories, when they come, are awful. Anne, their mother, met Smyth when she was 16 and dedicated herself to being the perfect Christian wife. Fiona considers her “his first victim” though the question of whether this entirely absolves her of responsibility for what she knew of his crimes is raised among them.The film gives all its participants’ contributions time to breathe, and time for the viewer to reflect on the many delicate, intelligent insights offered. The grace and – towards Anne – forgiveness offered are breathtaking and only throw into further relief the evil of the man who made, who makes it necessary. The family still believes in God. Those of us who don’t will probably find ourselves hoping that there is at least a hell.I hope too that Welby is watching.See No Evil is on Channel 4Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionChristianityAnglicanismJustin WelbyreviewsShareReuse this content"

The app’s premise of logging reviews of every film you watch felt like counting steps, and I generally prefer to exercise my pretension the old fashioned way – such as getting a BFA or frequenting art house cinema screenings where I am usually the only person under 50 in the theater.But after I wrote aboutmy feelgood moviefor the Guardian – that would beSullivan’s Travels, Preston Sturges’s perfect 1941 satire – I was swayed by two newsroom colleagues. “Hey Alaina, we heard you like movies,” one of them said. “What’s your Letterboxd?” I wanted to be part of the club, and signed up later that night. Now, I write thoughts on every movie I see, usually before I’ve even left the theater or closed out the streamer.Swear, self-promote and pretend you’re on a first date: a celebrities’ guide to Letterboxd’s Four FavouritesRead moreThough the movie-cataloging app has existed since 2011, it grew in popularity during Covid lockdown, when people stuck at home had little else to do than peacock their film taste. Most Letterboxd usersskew young, between the ages of 18 and 34, and tend to spend more money on movies than the typical American. In 2024 the app hit 17 million users, around the same time that the rapid-fire, red carpet interview series Letterboxd Four Favorites started going viral. This modest popularity is set against a film industry in crisis, with productions down and unemployment up. Last week’s announcement ofNetflix’s acquisitionof Warner Bros – or will it be ahostile takeoverbyParamount Skydance? – felt especially depressing to those who cherish the act of moviegoing, as many fear the streamer’s triumph will be the death knell for cinemas.On Wednesday, Letterboxd launched an in-app video rental “store” – which, pointedly, it isnotcalling a streaming service. “Think of it as curated shelves instead of just scrolling lists endlessly without being able to make up your mind on what to watch,” a press releaseread. The films will include festival circuit darlings that have yet to acquire mainstream distribution (such as It Ends, Alexander Ullom’s horror debut about four friends stuck on an increasingly creepy night drive, which TikTok is particularly excited about), reissues and rediscoveries of forgotten classics, and limited-time drops.It reminds me of the old days of social media, when you just shared your opinions with friendsGigi LealThat makes sense, given Letterboxd’s reputation as a haven for the type of A24-pilled film viewer who might wait in line for hours for Marty Supreme swag, or carry a Metrograph-branded tote. We have made fun of archetypal film bro since at least Annie Hall, when Woody Allen’s character cannot stand the man behind him at the movies who over-intellectualizes the latest Fellini film while speaking over his date. Many of Letterboxd’s users come from film Twitter, a masculine-leaning space where outrage, irreverence and purposefully bad takes run rampant. (See: theflurry of discourseabout the use of a Nick Cave song in Train Dreams, Clint Bentley’s Netflix drama about the life of a Pacific north-west railway worker.)Still, many of the most-followed people on the app are not your average film bro: the actor Ayo Edebiri is known for her now-deletedaccountwhere she called Yoda from Star Wars “ugly” and called a Fast and Furious installment “really and truly post-God”. The pop star Charli xcx has logged more than 1,000 films, with Céline and Julie Go Boating (1974) and Phantom Thread (2017) among her top four. Some Letterboxd reviews go viral. Zoë Rose Bryant, a film Twitter stalwart and critic recently posted avery personal takeon Joachim Trier’s Sentimental Value, relating the family drama to her parents’ divorce.View image in fullscreenThe author’s ‘crash out cinema’ list on Letterboxd.Photograph: Alaina DemopoulosLetterboxd likes to tout itself as a means of film discovery; users make “watchlists”, some of which are hyperspecific. (One of my friend has cultivated a list of 30 movies about “Fucked-Up British People”, while I made “crash out cinema”, a collection of films to watch when you’re in the throes of a maybe-unrequited crush.) You can browse a feed of your friends’ activity, see what’s popular this week, and search any movie to see every single Letterboxd review on it ever written by anyone.In an email a representative for Letterboxd wrote: “Letterboxd is less a social media platform, more a community.” It doesn’t have an infinite scroll, or rely on algorithms to inspire a user’s next movie night.Gigi Leal is a 33-year-old content creator and film horror buff who loves Letterboxd. “It’s like a movie diary,” she said. “It reminds me of the old days of social media, when you just shared your opinions with friends.” Most people agree that Letterboxd’s strength as a social networking site lies in what itdoesn’thave: there’s no way to message people or post pictures.“In a way, it’s in its early stage of what it wants to be,” said Chris Hite, a professor of film at Allan Hancock College in Santa Maria, California. “If Letterboxd opens up the types of interactions people can have, then the fear is it goes the way of the toxic environment of Twitter or Facebook that we’ve all witnessed.”Ezgi Eren writes 11am Saturday, a Substack where she interviews film people about going to the movies; she took the title from her favorite time to catch a screening. “I think there is a danger in Letterboxd becoming a full-on social media platform,” said Eren, who is 35 and lives in Los Angeles. “Maybe people would be incentivized to take pictures in the middle of a movie, or crack jokes at a screening. There’s a joke that Letterboxd should launch a dating app, but I think they should never do that.”That’s Letterboxd’s sweet spot: finding those films that you’re surprised haven’t been given the light of daySpencer TurneySpencer Turney runs Rewind Room, a pop-up that operates monthly screenings out of the back of a Chicago coffee and plant shop. He scours Letterboxd like a record store cratedigger, looking for films to add to the series. One of those was Chameleon Street, Wendell B Harris Jr’s 1989 Sundance darling about a conman who impersonates doctors, reporters and sports stars.“That’s Letterboxd’s sweet spot: finding those films that you’re surprised haven’t been given the light of day,” said Turney, 34. “It’s cool to have this shared reference point and language for discussing movies, but you don’t drown away in the brain rot of watching someone throwing Oreo cookies into a lasagne, or whatever else you’d see on TikTok.”Leal, the horror-movie obsessive, said that Letterboxd has become her “first form of information” when she is researching film, a sort of Rotten Tomatoes that prioritizes friends’ takes over, say, that of New York Times chief film critic Manohla Dargis. “A lot of times, I’ll just go there to see how other people have perceived it,” she said. “It’s not limiting for me, because I love to watch movies people say are bad and judge for myself. But my boyfriend will see an average review of 2.1 and be like, ‘No, that’s a bad movie’ and not watch it.”Letterboxd lives in a fractured film ecosystem; few people rely on establishment critics to make a decision about what they want to watch these days. Instead, fans digest culture through YouTube plot breakdowns or TikTok reaction videos, along with their Letterboxd network’s viewing history.Ali El-Sadany, editor-in-chief of film review site FilmSlop, is an enthusiastic Letterboxd user – even if he is not the biggest fan of its basic premise of distilling a film down to a five-star rating. “I hate that we exist in a world where everything has to be quantified, and I think that we should just watch movies for what they are and tell us how they made you feel as a human being,” he said. Still, he believes that Letterboxd “is an app that brings so many voices together, and has been platforming the better ones most of the time”.Covid was supposed to kill cinema – but did lockdown and gen Z save cinephilia?Read moreLeal said that she sometimes gets distracted during a movie, thinking about how she will rate it on Letterboxd. This happened during a screening of Marty Supreme, the new Timothée Chalamet ping-pong drama directed by film Twitter favorite Josh Safdie. “Every 15 minutes, I kept thinking ‘don’t forget this line, you want to put it in your review.’”I know the feeling. A few weeks ago, while sick in bed, I rewatched Singin’ in the Rain, which I first saw when I was 10 years old and have screened countless times since. In the middle of Donald O’Connor’s mind-bogglingly athletic performance of Make ‘Em Laugh, where the former vaudevillian completes multiple backflips and pratfalls, I lazily opened Letterboxd to see what the audience had to say. It took about five minutes of scrolling through reviews to realize I had missed the best part of the movie – one of the best parts of any movie, ever. Sending my cosmic apologies to the long-deceased, but always legendary O’Connor, I closed Letterboxd and went back to watching.Explore more on these topicsFilmSocial mediaDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, it marks a sea change for retailers accustomed to paying search engines to promote their listings.LLMs allow users to ask questions in conversational language, perhaps by speaking into their computer or phone. Instead of just providing a list of links, they offer specific suggestions with the potential for big sales for items that are regularly recommended.The chatbots produce their responses by scraping the internet and inbuilt datasets for relevant information, with some sources given more trusted status than others.Companies large and small are scrambling to adapt to this new world where the keywords and advertising deals previously central to web marketing hold less importance than the reviewers’ opinions, accurate availability information and product details read by LLMs such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini and Meta’s Llama.The shake-up may create an opening for independent businesses to cut through online, but some big brands are concerned they will be lost in a wild west where it is unclear how to reach the consumer. Marketers must now appeal not only to shoppers directly but also to their AI bots.“Retailers can’t buy their way into the search – they have to earn it,” says Emma Ford, the director of digital transformation for PwC UK. “The experience, expertise, authenticity and trustworthiness [of a brand online] help. Sentiment across the internet is really important.”Several large UK retailers have told the Guardian they already have teams on the case looking at a wide variety of tactics, from making sure they appear in Reddit forums – akey source for some platforms– to responding to reviews on Google or Trustpilot, and ensuring AI models can access the correct product data.While some say they are being cautious with resources, amid signs certain individual LLMs could disappear as rapidly as they have sprung up, the belief is that this new way of interacting online is here to stay.Nickyl Raithatha, the chief executive of the online card and gift seller Moonpig, says AI search’s relevance for companies this year is relatively low but his company iswell-prepared for rapid change.He says Moonpig is ensuring its products are picked up in AI search by using generative engine optimisation (GEO) techniques such as “online content with people discussing the best way to make someone happy on Mothers Day” in its own content or on discussions boards and in YouTube videos. He adds: “There is a growing science around this and we are all learning.”Ford says businesses are still feeling their way into the nuances of how the technology will find and respond to their online presence. Online reviews, for example, are clearly a factor in AI decision-making, but it is not clear how much importance is placed on particular platforms or how they rank against other factors such as reliable availability data, longevity of a brand or secure payment options.It may be that suppliers that have been around longer and have a broader profile are foregrounded, but their long history of ups and downs could also play against them.“I do think AI will change retail for the next 20 years,” says Peter Ruis, the managing director of John Lewis. He contends that established brands such as his will benefit from having a strong reputation with the technology in place to sell online, while shoppers could discover they stock items previously assumed to have been available only at a specialist.In future, industry watchers believe, ChatGPT, Amazon and Google are likely to try to monetise their AI platforms with some form of paid search or featured ads.More sophisticated “AI agent” models are also being developed – bots that can autonomously perform complex multistage tasks such as seeking out the best deals, placing orders and organising delivery.For example, it could be possible for these digital secretaries to negotiate offers tailored to particular customers, such as bundling together a number of furniture purchases from various outlets during a move, which have been customised to fit budget, style and delivery preferences, according to the advisory firm McKinsey.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Retailers will need systems that can cope with a potential flurry of queries and to have clear rules on who might be responsible for glitches such as unwanted purchases made by a bot.In the US, the online marketplace Etsy was the first toteam up with ChatGPTto make it possible to pay for goods via the LLM’s instant checkout service. The e-commerce platform Shopify and the retailers Walmart and Target swiftly followed. While the deals do not appear to prioritise their products in searches, the inclusion of a “buy” button for their goods could put them ahead of the pack.Anna Bancroft, a partner in PwC’s digital transformation team, points out that under current UK rules it is not possible for an AI bot to make a purchase on behalf of a human, and regulation would need to change for such systems to run without human oversight. She says retailers and shoppers are cautious about giving the robots access to customer data and handling payment.There are also concerns about agents being susceptible to manipulation, as Microsoft has found inresearch simulations. Meanwhile, tech retail players are becoming territorial about who gets to crawl whose data.Last month, Amazonsued the AI company Perplexityover its shopping feature that automates placing orders for users. Amazon accused the startup of covertly accessing customer accounts and disguising AI activity as human browsing. Perplexityhit back, defending users’ right to delegate their shopping to AI agents and calling the suit “a bully tactic to suppress competition”.In this rapidly shifting landscape, Ford suggests independent retailers may have a chance to shine. “Independents have potential to go faster,” she says, with the ability to respond nimbly without having to sign off large budgets.Michelle Ovens, the founder of Small Business Britain, which advises independent retailers on how to survive on the changing high street, agrees. “[Independent businesses] don’t necessarily need to spend a lot of money. You don’t necessarily need a big team,” she says.Ovens advises local shopkeepers to ask AI platforms themselves how best to make sure they can appear. “Be clear about who you are,” she says, with a description making clear that you are an independent specialist, up-to-date pictures and “encourage customers who have got experience of the brand to give a good review”.However, all of this should not stand ahead of making a website engaging and easy to shop on, Ovens adds. “There will not be a dramatic shift this Christmas. We’ll see change over time and operators will rise to the challenge.”Explore more on these topicsRetail industryArtificial intelligence (AI)ShoppingOnline shoppingConsumer affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Broadly appealing, well cast, neither strictly comic nor melodramatic, concerning ordinary people in non-IP circumstances, it’s the type of mid-budget adult film that used to appear regularly in cinemas in the 90s and aughts, before the streaming wars devoured the market. Even its lead promotional image, turned into a life-size cardboard cut-out at the theater – Emma Mackey’s titular Ella in a sensible trench coat, balancing on one foot as she fixes a broken block heel – recalls a bygone era of films like Confessions of a Shopaholic, Miss Congeniality or Little Miss Sunshine, that would now go straight to streaming.Merv review – a dog steals the show in Amazon’s by-the-book Christmas romcomRead moreTo be clear, I miss these types of movies, and want to see more of them. I want to see a lighthearted but realistic portrait of a 34-year-old woman serving as lieutenant governor of an unnamed state that is, judging by the college football paraphernalia and the vibe, probably Michigan. I want to still believe in the possibility of smart and sentimental popcorn fare whose low-stakes drama insists on the inherent inconsistencies and decency of people. I especially would like to say that Ella McCay is an admirable final salvo (or so) for Brooks, the 85-year-old writer/director/producer whose prolific career includes both iconic sitcoms (The Mary Tyler Moore show, Taxi and the Simpsons), and now-classic films (Terms of Endearment, Broadcast News and As Good As It Gets).Unfortunately, I cannot say any of that, as Ella McCay is, first and foremost, a mess – a clunky collection of incoherent characters and confounding plot that seem to defy basic story logic at every turn, and not in a surprising or intriguing way. It’s never a good sign when the lead character reads the literal definition for trauma, finger tracing the dictionary, in the first five minutes of a movie.As told by Estelle (Julie Kavner), Ella’s secretary and the film’s narrator, this is supposedly the story of the remarkable Ella McCay, a highly intelligent and moral woman who overcame the shame of a philandering father (Woody Harrelson) and the trauma (yes) of her mother’s untimely death (she’s played, too briefly, by Rebecca Hall), to become one of the youngest political fixtures of her home state. But that narrative spine frays quickly into strangely disconnected tangents that precede at a jarring rhythm, as the film insists on tying each scene into a sweet bow no matter how incongruous to the conversation preceding it. It would be transfixing, to watch a film so oddly and awkwardly constructed, if it weren’t also so disappointing.The would-be mosaic of characters in the Ella-verse include her beloved Aunt Helen, played byJamie Lee Curtisin what feels like a pantomime of a hammy Jamie Lee Curtis character; her prodigal father, returned to make amends for selfish reasons; her husband Ryan (Jack Lowden), a local restaurateur who is supportive of Ella’s career until, suddenly and without reason, he isn’t (I have to assume there were 45 sense-making minutes cut from this nearly two-hour film); and her younger brother Casey (Spike Fearn), an agoraphobic quant reeling from a breakup with Ayo Edebiri’s Susan, a classic awkward Edebiri character who in any other movie would be cut for time. Also, there’s Kumail Nanjiani as the friendly state trooper whose name may as well be Quippy Side Character, and Albert Brooks as Governor Bill, dispensing such clanging political wisdom as “you have to make dumb people feel less dumb”.Eventually, it becomes apparent that the film concerns McCay’s days-long stint as governor in 2008, a time conveniently without Twitter or Trump, after Governor Bill leaves for the Obama administration. How did this highly ambitious, undeniably beautiful policy wonk become the Lady Jane Grey of presumably Michigan, briefly lifted from obscurity and felled by forces largely outside her control? Ella McCay doesn’t seem that interested in telling you, instead stumbling about the story as if rummaging through a teenager’s unkempt room, pulling and replacing random objects on the pile.It would be impossible for most actors to rise above such disarray, or to play both 34 and 16 (in flashbacks). Though Mackey ably tries – my eyes lit up when she blisters through a cannabis-inflected rant, providing a too-brief window into the frantic inner monologue of a woman with a lot of liberal policy ideas – she can’t sell a heroine whose defining character traits are wonkish-ness and reactivity. Which is a shame, as there’s clearly something here, buried beneath the polished, inauthentic sheen of the movie politician. I saw a brief flash of it, late in the film, as Ella faces a choice between her morals and her marriage – a flicker of tough, contradictory and ineffable feelings, a hint of a better, thornier, lived-in movie. A second where she, too, wishes it were different.Ella McCay is out in cinemas on 12 DecemberExplore more on these topicsJames L BrooksJamie Lee CurtisWoody HarrelsonJack LowdenComedy filmsRebecca HallComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

This isn’t pragmatism – it’s crueltySteve Valdez-Symonds is refugee and migrant rights director at Amnesty UKWed 10 Dec 2025 10.25 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 12.28 ESTShareWhen Keir Starmer and Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, argue that asylum protections must be rewritten for a new “era”, they are not simply adjusting policy. They arereshaping the moral groundour societies stand on.Their message is clear: hardening rules so that fewer people receive protection is the way to restore confidence in their leadership. They present this as measured and responsible, even progressive. But what they propose is not a new centre ground; it is a retreat into a politics that regards some lives as less worthy than others.And there is a dreadful irony in seeing such a message conveyed just as the UK justice secretary, David Lammy, and Richard Hermer, the attorney general,travel to Strasbourgon International Human Rights Day – an occasion createdto commemoratethe Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the recognition, set down by the postwar generation, that dignity must not depend on borders, status or political fashion.Human rights were never designed only for safe, comfortable times. They were written precisely for moments like this: when pressure mounts, when scapegoating becomes tempting, when compassion is portrayed as weakness. These protections exist to prevent us from repeating history’s worst mistakes. The whole point of human rights is that they are neither negotiable nor temporary.Yet according to reports, UK ministers are seeking to reinterpret or restrictprotections enshrinedin the European convention on human rights (ECHR) – including the absolute ban on torture and inhuman or degrading treatment under article 3, and article 8, which protects the right to a private life and a family life. These proposals would strip fundamental protections from people fleeing war, persecution or serious harm. Article 3 contains no exceptions. Once you accept that some suffering is acceptable for some people, the principle collapses for everyone.What is even more concerning is the political calculation behind this shift. There appears to be a belief inside government, shared with its predecessors, that if they only appear tougher, if they tweak legal guidance or pick fights with the ECHR, anger over asylum seekers will subside. Advisers who have spent years managing headlines rather than solving problems now tell leaders: this is how you defuse the issue.We have seen exactly where this approach leads. It is the Brexit playbook: concede the premise of those demanding dismantlement, accept their framing, and hope your softer edge keeps you safe. It did not work then and it will not work now. Because once you agree that rights are the real obstacle, you have already handed victory to those who want rid of them altogether.Starmer says he wants the UK to remain in the convention. Yet by echoing the diagnosis of Nigel Farage and others, that human rights protections prevent governments taking back “control”, he is already on their path. The destination becomes harder to avoid once you have set out in their direction.We are not talking about abstract principles. We are talking about children separated from parents. Trafficking survivors sent back to abusers. Torture survivors returned to torture. Real human beings whose futures depend on whether our leaders uphold protections or erode them.If ministers were genuinely interested in fixing the system, they would stop pretending that cruelty is capability. The UK’s costly asylum backlog is not caused by rights. It is the product of years of deliberate mismanagement: banning people from working, trapping them in limbo and relying on expensive, unsuitable accommodation that helps no one.There are solutions that actually work. The UK could provide safe routes so that fewer people are forced into dangerous journeys. It could restore swifter, fairer asylum decision-making, clearing the backlog and allowing people to rebuild their lives, while ensuring the return of people without good claims is carried out with dignity. It could support communities instead of leaving them under-resourced and resentful. It could work internationally to address the conflicts and instability that drive people from their homes.Starmer and Frederiksen say they want to protect the fabric of our societies. But that fabric is not torn by people seeking sanctuary. It frays when leaders imply that some people’s suffering counts for less. It weakens when governments teach the public that fellow human beings should be treated harshly to make a point.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it’s a startZoe WilliamsWe need people from Europe to move to the UK – but also a way to give Brits the opportunity to build the futures they craveWed 10 Dec 2025 12.01 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 18.14 ESTShareAnnouncing her new Youth Matters plan – £500m to “boost resilience and teach skills” – the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, spoke of a “violent indifference” from the political establishment towards young people that had been going on “for decades”. She’s not wrong. We can look at all of the ways in which young people have seen their economic prospects and work opportunities systematically destroyed – and see that they all date from 2010.First, the tripling of the tuition fee cap saddled them with debts that have become astronomical, particularly for degrees that are socially beneficial, such as medicine and nursing; this, incidentally, from a coalition in which one partyexplicitly promisednever to do that. Yet for all its boldness in setting fire to manifesto promises and playing fast and loose with a generation’s future, the tuition fees policy didn’t actually deliver a sustainable funding plan for tertiary education – instead leaving it to cross-subsidise with foreign students, whom the political establishment has spent the past five yearstrying to chase out of the country.Then,Brexitremoved young people’s freedom of movement, while making their country permanently poorer. I didn’t vote for that, but at least Icouldhave; I cannot imagine the indignation I’d feel if I’d been under 18 for the referendum and still had to deal with its consequences every day, while simultaneously being told that it was my fault the “red wall” was angry, because I was too woke.Political cliche offers us a simple explanation: old people vote, young people don’t, therefore the old are rigorously prioritised, whether by the benefits system with the triple-lock, or the political culture, which puts their abstract notions of sovereignty and amorphous concerns about Britishness above anything an 18-year-old might think about finding a bar job in Split.To accept that, though, is to accept that politics has been profoundly debased; the principle that each new generation should have it better than the last was what the whole thing was supposed to be all about. To casually replace that with a presumption of electoral self-interest above all is not just cynical and narrow, it freezes the discourse in a perpetual, circular present, with MPs fighting to retain their power for no better reason than that their power is retained.It’s only when organisations pop up and advocate for the young that you realise how rare that now is. This morning the cross-party UK Trade and Business Commissionproduced a reportrecommending terms for a time-limited youth experience scheme, capped at 44,000 visas in the first year. They wouldn’t be tied to any particular job or study, and young people could use them in combination with student visas to get more years in the UK. GB News was quick to respond, interviewing the Conservative MP Gareth Davies, who said: “We want less migration not more migration and we know that Labour are cosying up to the European Union”. The fact that this is untrue – 72% of Britons support such a scheme – is just detail.In the neutral, pragmatic, sleeves-rolled-up language of a trade organisation, this report delivers an important warning: they arrived at that figure of 44,000 because that’s how many more young people are leaving, for New Zealand, Canada and Australia, than are coming in. You could pinpoint proximal reasons for that – student debt, wage stagnation and the underfunding of services are making it much more attractive to be a doctor in Australia than in the UK, for example. Our political establishment, with its “violent indifference” to young people, has made a forceful case for emigration.Whether that’s because you can’t ignore an entire generation for ever without breaking the bonds of patriotic loyalty, or whether it’s because a bunch of young people could just use a break from the tedium and stasis of their own political culture, has yet to become clear. But it would be foolish not to consider the real danger of the scheme, which is not the arrival of energetic, adventurous, ambitious young Europeans. Rather, it’s that young Britons, their interests disregarded so openly, so shamelessly, will leave and move mountains to not come back.That’s not an argument against the scheme, incidentally. As Sting would tell you, if you love them, set them free.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But was Tarantino’s pronouncement just bluster and flex? Will he end up casting Dano in his next film – a turnaround like Donald Trump making nice with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un after pretty much threatening him with nuclear war? Or are we witnessing a kind of midlife emotional crisis in the heart of one of the most brilliant directors of his generation? I speak as a superfan with reservations.In his recent podcast interview with the legendary controversial author Bret Easton Ellis – and therefore perhaps in a mood to provoke andépater les bourgeoisde la critique– Tarantino unveiled his top 20 best films of the 21st century. Asked why Paul Thomas Anderson’sThere Will Be Bloodwas only at number 5, Tarantino declared that Dano was the problem: “[Dano] is weak sauce, man. He is the weak sister … He’s just such a weak, weak, uninteresting guy.”Daniel Day-Lewis defends Paul Dano after Tarantino criticismRead moreHmm. This isn’t an accurate assessment of Dano. But it could be that Tarantino’s feelings about Anderson are in any case more complicated than that.The top 10 half of his picks is an almost ostentatiously normie list, a Letterboxd civilian list, in reverse order: Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris, Edgar Wright’s Shaun of the Dead, George Miller’s Mad Max: Fury Road, Tony Scott’s Unstoppable, David Fincher’s Zodiac, PTA’s There Will Be Blood, Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk, Sofia Coppola’s Lost in Translation, Lee Unkrich’s Toy Story 3 and Ridley Scott’s wartime action-thriller Black Hawk Down at the very top. Well, OK. No one should patronise a cinephile connoisseur like Tarantino by dismissing this selection as populist – almost all of them are absolutely great, although I am baffled by the inclusion of Tony Scott’sdire Unstoppable.Is Tarantino trolling the wokesters by including Woody Allen? I would have gone for Allen’s Blue Jasmine. I am not every bit as saucer-eyed about Miller’s Mad Max revivals as other people, but they’re certainly really good, and Scott’s Black Hawk Down is a wildly impressive two-hour-plus action sequence – but, please, Scott’s Gladiator is surely a better film, released in 2000, and only a pedant would say that doesn’t count as 21st century. As for the others: yes, absolutely great – and on a patriotic note, it’s nice to see Wright’s Shaun of the Dead, which way back at the beginning of the 00s revived self-respect for the British film industry.It is certainly not the hipster-obscure selection that you might expect, certainly from, say, reading Tarantino’s fascinating memoirCinema Speculation.The more recondite titles (and non-English-language titles) come in the 10 lower down, in reverse order from 20 to 11: Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story, Eli Roth’s Cabin Fever, Bennett Miller’s Moneyball, Prachya Pinkaew’s Chocolate, Rob Zombie’s The Devil’s Rejects, Mel Gibson’s The Passion of the Christ, Richard Linklater’s School of Rock, Jeff Tremaine’s Jackass: The Movie, Aharon Keshales and Navot Papushado’s Big Bad Wolves, and Kinji Fukasaku’s Battle Royale.That seems more to be the QT we know and love. There’s Fukasuku’s badass survival-reality masterpiece Battle Royale – which Tarantino correctly says was ripped off by the Hunger Games franchise – the Thai martial-arts actioner Chocolate and the Israeli horror-thriller Big Bad Wolves. I agree with Tarantino that Spielberg’s West Side Story is great (although here too Tarantino is a bit salty about the cast: “I couldn’t believe I liked the lead [Ansel Elgort] as I didn’t like him in anything else” ). I like his praise for Brad Pitt’s movie-star mystique in Moneyball, although Pitt is far better in Tarantino’s own Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. I’m not down with Roth’s Cabin Fever or Zombie’s tiresome Devil’s Rejects, and Gibson’s Passion is a non-sacred turkey fit only for the culture wars. Linklater’s School of Rock is great fun, but only a contorted inverse snobbery pose can put that in there and not Linklater’s real masterpiece, Boyhood.View image in fullscreenPaul Dano and Daniel Day-Lewis in Paul Thomas Anderson’s There Will Be Blood, 2007.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyBut we’re back toPaul Thomas Andersonand There Will Be Blood; Tarantino wouldn’t be human if he wasn’t aware of PTA’s status as a rival to his own and of Anderson as a film-maker who seems to be creating work with more fluency and productivity than Tarantino right now, and he might have picked a quarrel with Dano on the spur of the moment just to take PTA down a few pegs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This intriguing and amusing list, in which commercialism and cinephilia are such a complex mix, may in fact constitute the “movie critic” performance that his abandoned film was going to be.So how does Tarantino see himself now? Does he think he has one big masterpiece left in him? I think he does. More than one, probably. He has said he doesn’t want to go on past 10 films, having so far made nine, and said that a great master like Don Siegel should have quit while he was ahead after Escape from Alcatraz in 1979.But the time has come for QT to stop sulking in his tent, stop making irrelevant pronouncements on podcasts. Tarantino created this 10-film idea; he certainly can’t quit at nine films – but there’s an enormous amount of self-imposed pressure. This 10-and-no-more thing has pointlessly paralysed him, and his Dano outburst is just a symptom of that. My prediction is that Tarantino will go for an adaptation, his first since Jackie Brown: he will find a novel and supercharge the pulp with shock and flair. AndPaul Danowill be in it.Explore more on these topicsQuentin TarantinoPaul Thomas AndersonPaul DanocommentShareReuse this content"

Brexit, Covid, austerity and the rise in the cost of living haven’t helped.From the students’ perspectives, they’ve gone through a lot to get here too. Not just the usual high-level academic performance and résumé-building either. This is a group who dealt with school closures and lockdowns during impressionable years, many come from crowded schools with little support and coaching, and yet they’ve found a way to persevere.Having spent years teaching in medical schools and talking to students, my main feeling is hope. They’re smart, respectful and polite, with interesting backgrounds and ideas. Rather than being put off by the pandemic, some have been drawn to medicine because of the key role of the NHS during those difficult years, and remember joining the Thursday “clap for carers” and putting rainbow signs in their windows at home. Quite a few are keen to get into public health research and want to combine clinical and academic careers.These are young people who could walk into finance, tech, consulting, influencing … careers where their intelligence and work ethic would be rewarded with salaries unthinkable in medical pay packets. They could choose a different life. But they have chosen medicine.What lies ahead isn’t pretty: night shifts, weekends on-call and a future of working in intense environments. This could be in A&E or surgery, where treatment is literally about life and death. Or working in a GP practice where they’ll meet patient after patient where the suffering isn’t only medical, but also social – financial precarity, loneliness, bad housing – and they’ll be expected to find a solution. As Covid showed us, it could be working through a pandemic and watching your colleagues get sick and die (sometimes because of inappropriate PPE), or burn out and walk away from medicine.And don’t even mention the pay: after all those years of training,pay starts at £18.62/hour in England, although with overtime over nights and weekends this can go up to £20-30/hour. Yes this is a good wage, but is it in line with the qualifications, responsibilities and expertise the job requires? They used to be officially called “junior doctors”, but the newly introduced title “resident doctor” is more appropriate given they’re often the first point of contact for sick patients and have independent clinical responsibilities. The allocation system for resident doctors means that they can’t commit to living in a specific city or location: they can note their preferences but could end up being placed in hospitals hundreds of miles away, depending on the match between request and need.Medicine used to, at least, be a stable profession with a job at the end of the long training road. But what awaits many graduates is uncertainty, whether it’s training bottlenecks, chaotic rotas or even unemployment, given funding cuts. The UK already hasfewer doctors per capitathan many comparable nations and struggles to retain the ones it has, given more attractive careers abroad, for example in Australia or Ireland. As a GP colleague said to me: “When many GP registrars finish their full training, there are no jobs for them, because of the lack of investment in general practice. So, they are forced to locum [ad hoc work] and many are leaving the country.”I have mixed emotions thinking about the past week. Sitting across from these candidates, who are articulate, values-driven and hard-working, I felt enormous hope. They are exactly the sort of people you’d want making decisions in a crisis, breaking difficult news to a family, or calmly helping someone put together a life that has gone physically or emotionally off track.But I also felt sadness, because I know that the system they are stepping into may not treat them with the same care they plan to offer others. We need to ask: if we expect these young doctors to invest their lives into the NHS and the values underpinning publicly provided universal healthcare, shouldn’t we make sure this commitment isn’t betrayed? That at the very least there’s a job at the end of the long road? And that they are not wasted in a system that undervalues their training and increasingly replaces them with less-trained practitioners simply to fill staffing gaps?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not just a lumberjack, Duffy also made waves on late-90s reality TV shows The Real World: Boston and Road Rules: All Stars. And now Duffy is parlaying his experience on Road Rules into his role as US transportation secretary.Duffy has got a lot on his big lumberjack hands: transport infrastructure in the US is, to use the technical term, a hot mess. More than a third of the country’sbridges need major repair workor replacement. There has been little historical investment in railways and the country lags behind the rest of the industrialized world when it comes tohigh-speed trains. Meanwhile, there’s a chronicair-traffic-controller shortage, which was exacerbated by the recent government shutdown when a number of controllers, fed up with the dysfunctional system, took earlyretirement.Don’t worry, though, Sean Dog is on the case! On Monday the transportation secretary held a flashypress conferencewith health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr at Washington DC’s Reagan national airport to talk about his plans to usher in a golden age of air travel. The pair didn’t spend much time on the boring ins and outs of air-traffic-controller recruitment, which Duffy has made afew movesto address elsewhere. Nor did they discussshrinking airplane seatsor junk fees that force you to pay more for basic things like seat selection. Instead, they did a lot of pull-ups for the camera. Duffy did 10 pull-ups. RFK Jr, who is 71 years old, did 20.I can’t think of anything more pleasant than ... [being] surrounded by travelers who just worked up a sweatWhy were we treated to this testosterone fest? Because Duffy has a plan to make air travel more pleasant – and has managed to conjure up $1bn in grant money to do so – seemingly by transforming airports into wellness spaces. “Maybe I want a workout area where people might get some blood flow doing some pull-ups or some step-ups in the airport,” the transport secretary mused.Paul Saladino, an influencer who has been a big believer in the “carnivore diet” andraw milk, was brought on to flesh out this plan. “What if we could create small spaces for Americans in airports to get mini workouts?” Saladino enthused. “Maybe some treadmills for people who want to walk near their gate … maybe some exercise bikes?”Why not indeed? I can’t think of anything more pleasant than cramming myself into a tiny seat in a crowded airplane surrounded by travelers who just worked up a sweat doing pre-flight push-ups.If the thought of stale sweat at 30,000ft doesn’t make you queasy, I have something else that might turn your stomach: RFK Jr payingtributeto “a mother’s breast”. The press conference touched on airports needing more breastfeeding spaces, which, to be fair, is a valid point. It’s just a shame Duffy and RFK Jr had to make it creepy andpronatalistby bringing on conservative podcaster Isabel Brown to talk about encouraging young women “to embrace the beauty of motherhood”.Duffy has plenty of ideas for upgrading air travel. Last month he unveiled acivility campaigncalled The Golden Age of Travel Starts With You. The website explains that it’s supposed to “jumpstart a nationwide conversation around how we can all restore courtesy and class to air travel”.If we’re going to have a conversation aboutcivility,any chance we can start with the people, I don’t know, running the country? Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, is constantly posting on X about “cucks” and telling journalists to “shut the fuck up”. And then there’s Potus himself. Trump recently called a journalist “piggy” during a press gaggle on Air Force One, which is certainly one way to jumpstart a nationwide conversation about restoring courtesy to air travel.Welcome on board this aircraft. Please return your seat to the upright position – for ever | Arwa MahdawiRead moreLikewise, Duffy has a sartorial vision for this golden age of air travel; he wants people to dress up for their basic-economy flights. In a press conference before Thanksgiving, Duffy urged flyers to “dress a little better”. Don’t ask how you’re supposed to simultaneously dress fancyanduse the airport as a workout space, by the way. On that he was unclear.I’m not the only skeptic: various TikTokers are wearingpyjamasto the airport in protest against governmental entreaties to dress better. Even the Magasphere thinks Duffy has some weird priorities. “I’m sick of people in government going: ‘Well, the golden age of travel starts with you. Dress up. Be courteous,’” rightwing podcaster Tim Dillonsaid on a recent episode. “Hey Sean, no one has any money. No one has any goddamn money, you fool.”Of course, that’s not entirely true. The ultra-wealthy are living in agolden ageof private air travel. And I’ve got a funny feeling that you’re not going to catch any of them doing pull-ups at the airport next to the likes of me and you.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionAir transportUS politicsRobert F Kennedy JrHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

There’s nothing I like more than submerging myself in a subject area for a couple of weeks, grabbing as many stories as I can, and then turning to my friends and saying, “Did you know …”If this makes me sound insufferable, it’s because I probably am, but at least I make up for it by providing little anecdotes about the life of Ludwig von Köchel, the man who invented the system for organising the music of Mozart (he was also an accomplished botanist). It doesn’t even really matterwhatthe area of interest is. Over the course of a couple of weeks this year, I read back to back biographies about Malcolm X before discovering the Swedish band Bob Hund, who sing exclusively in a language I don’t speak, and who I could now deliver a short-ish university lecture on, if anyone was interested (my email’s available on my website).Sure, people tell you about sleepless nights. But why does no one mention the hell that is a parent WhatsApp group? | Sean SzepsRead moreThe reason for these scattershot research areas is because I am not really addicted to acquiring knowledge, though that’s a nice bonus. I am addicted, rather, to the high of realising just how much I don’t know. The thrill that drives me happensbeforeI buy the biography or delve into the article. It’s the thrill of coming face-to-face with my own ignorance and watching the horizons of the world suddenly and dramatically expand. In short: when I realise I don’t have a clue, the landscape of my life gets bigger.For some time, I thought this high was exclusively to be found in bookish pursuits. And then I started to run.Running tends to get characterised as an entirely physical pursuit, which is probably why I avoided it for so long. But although I can feel drastic changes in my body since I started running pretty much every day, much more notable are the ways it has drawn me into closer acquaintance with my own mind: with my own ignorance.Almost every single run, there comes a point when I think to myself,I literally cannot run any more. That point shifts deeper into the run every single time, but it does always come. I’m not sure I’ll ever really be able to escape it. It’s as inevitable as death or taxes and it has the sort of grim, insisting finality of both. When the thought hits me, it feels absolute, and every single muscle in my body saystime to stop then, I guess.But, almost immediately, another thought invariably creeps into my head. It says:I bet you can keep going. And suddenly I am filled with the realisation that what I had previously considered true is not; that I spend a lot of life unaware not only of vast swathes of beauty and research that are only a book away but also of my own capabilities. Because time after time, Icankeep running.The generational divide is so overrated – here’s how I crossed it and forged new friendships | Zoya PatelRead moreWe do not live in a world where ignorance is well regarded. It’s often described as the reason why the world is shifting dangerously towards the far right; for our growing societal callousness. Furthermore, in the age of AI, everyone is expected to have the answer for everything; to be completely informed on every matter. But if there’s one thing that running has taught me, it’s that certainty not only shrinks the world: it can also resemble a kind of death. If you are certain that you cannot run, you will not run.By contrast, saying, “I don’t know” is not a failure. It’s a way of gesturing out to a horizon that goes on forever: picking a point in the distance of total, supreme knowledge that, thankfully, we will never actually be able to reach. A point that, if we want to, we can run towards every single day, the sound of a Swedish rock band ringing in our ears.Joseph Earp is a critic, painter and novelist.

This is the danger inherent in the prime minister’sambition to “modernise”interpretations of ECHR articles relating to torture and entitlement to a family life.The claim is that, while the humanitarian essence of those protections is sacrosanct, they are applied too loosely. They are invoked in cases of economic and social privation that, while grim, do not conform to the spirit of provisions drafted for cases of war and persecution. The kernel of the argument is that economic migrants are gaming human rights protection, using asylum as a way to circumvent legal border controls, and that it should be easier to deport such people. It is true that volumes of asylum claims have increased and that this is a function of globalisation. In the 1950s, it was much harder to cross continents in search of sanctuary – or in pursuit of a better life. The difference between economic and humanitarian flight has always been more blurred than advocates of draconian control maintain.A common rhetorical device is to profess compassion for the “genuine” deserving refugee and then imply that such cases are few, relative to the majority who must, by extension, be bogus interlopers. That way, the asylum claims of people crossing the Channel in small boats are made to seem tenuous by default. The fact that they come by an illegal route is then used to portray themas criminals.That is an administrative trap. If there were more legal channels, fewer asylum claimants would make illegal crossings. The validity of their claims, the wars and torture they fear if forced to return to the countries they flee, would be the same. But their status on arrival would be less easy to vilify.This has been recognised by the government. A commitment to open safer legal routes does feature inLabour policy, albeit on a modest scale and never trumpeted because the primary message is tougher border controls. That imbalance points to a deeper flaw in the prime minister’s approach. Sir Keir’s claim when calling for reform of the ECHR is that adaptation to political pressure for migration control is a prerequisite for securing public consent for refugee protection. But the assertion of immutable values seems always to be deferred in favour of yet more expedient action.The prime minister would be more convincing if he dwelt less on public discontent as proof that support for human rights protection is being lost and applied himself more to making – and winning – a principled argument.Explore more on these topicsHuman rightsOpinionImmigration and asylumKeir StarmerLaboureditorialsShareReuse this content"

A broken safety net now shuts out the poorest and drives rising homelessnessWed 10 Dec 2025 13.45 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 14.56 ESTShareMoral logic is flipped on its head in England’s benefits system, which systematically excludes the poorest people from the only housing that was ever intended for them. Social homes were supposed to be for those who couldn’t afford private rents. However, anew report by Crisisshows that, because the stock of homes has been allowed to collapse, housing associations now ration supply by applying strict affordability tests. The homeless charity found that seven in 10 people with a history of rent arrears and no repayment plan would “sometimes” or “always” be excluded from housing registers. Perversely, England’s welfare system induces the very homelessness that it claims to alleviate.Financial checks, along with rules requiring “local connections”, sharply narrow who can join the queue for social housing. For those who do, a further round of pre-tenancy checks means that about a third of housing associations refuse accommodation because applicants cannot afford even modest rents, a problemrootedin benefit levels that are simply too low. Homelessness therefore rises by design rather than accident. Its origins lie in the coalition’s austerity programme: instead of building social homes, which would haveeasedpressure on welfare, the government redefined who could qualify. The then chancellor George Osborne,it was said, resisted building houses that might create Labour voters.Housing associationsbeganas charitable ventures, with an ethos ofpersonal responsibility. But for most of the 20th century, social housing in England was built and run by councils with central government funding. Then Margaret Thatcher introduced the “right to buy”– selling offmillionsof units of public housing. Only a fraction were ever replaced. Because local authorities lost stock and revenue, the state shifted responsibility to housing associations, which by2012 were governedby financial viability requirements. New-builds were constructed with expensive loans.What was once a moral mission to house excluded people has been replaced by acorporate logicthat screens them out. Rent collection became crucial, arrears became a “business risk”, and tenant assessment was prudent stewardship. Thelocalism actof David Cameron’s government, as Crisis says, shifted the responsibility to councils, which could narrow eligibility for housing so that need disappears. This is a cruel system. People with “complex needs” such as disability need support to sustain tenancies, but cuts to local council budgets mean there is no cash to do so.At the heart of the current dilemma is a catch-22: people are too poor to rent privately, yet too poor to pass affordability tests to get social housing. Scotland shows that this is a policy choice. Scottish housing associations are legally required to rehouse homeless households. In England just 27% of new social lettings go to homeless households. InScotlandthe figure is double that.Walesis looking to follow Scotland’s lead; so should England.There needs to be a wholesale rethink on welfare – not least so those on the lowest incomes can access, and afford, social homes. Crisis says the£39bndecade-long funding for Labour’s “affordable homes” programme is a good start. But it argues that 90,000 homes at social rent need to be built annually for the next 15 years. Without being expanded, the current plans amount to “rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic”. Clearly, if social housing is not rebuilt as a public good in England, the poorest will go under the waves.Explore more on these topicsSocial housingOpinionCommunitiesHousingLabourConservativesAusterityGeorge OsborneeditorialsShareReuse this content"

While it is sad that he was widowed early, he and his wife were able to travel and make choices – choices shaped principally by fear. That does not mean the law should be altered.What his account overlooks are the thousands of patients in the UK denied genuine choice because they lack access to palliative care. The House of Lords is rightly undertaking line‑by‑line scrutiny of the proposals, and expert testimony has raised serious concerns and widespread opposition. The current law already affords dignity and protection to vulnerable, elderly and disabled people. What we lack is sufficient palliative care and hospice provision, as repeatedly shown byHospice UKandNational Audit Officereports.Mr Sowry refers to differing moral frameworks, yet does not grasp the consequences of elevating autonomy above all other ethical principles. Healthcare staff cannot be detached from patients or the process; nor can families remain unaffected by a loved one’s decision to seek assisted suicide. To leave poor and vulnerable people unsupported, and potentially pressured into an assisted death, would be a grave injustice.If the bill is to proceed, it should be removed from the health service – assisted suicide is not a medical treatment. Only by recognising the social context in which decisions are made can we understand why this legislation is so deeply flawed.Dr Sarah DaviesConsultantphysician, Old Colwyn, ConwyDave Sowry writes: “Watching theHouse of Lordsdebate, it would be easy to forget who the bill is about. Terminally ill people should be the focus of all the deliberations.” Mr Sowry is entitled to represent his own situation, but legislators have an obligation to consider the second-order effects of laws that are going to affect everyone. This is a classic individual v collective dilemma. Individuals with terminal illnesses who are very clear in their own mind that they want to die are disadvantaged by our current laws – but in a compassionate society oriented around trying to prevent suicide, legalising assisted suicide for terminally ill people undermines all suicide-prevention efforts.Five per centof all deaths in Canada are now attributable to assisted suicide. Countries with state-assisted suicide programmes have seen their overall suicide rate increase. It would become a nonsense to have suicide-prevention programmes if this bill were passed into law. Assisted suicide is not legislation that can be passed in principle and the details worked out later, when every tweak means unnecessary deaths. If supporters of the assisted dying bill are frustrated by its progress, they should have crafted a better bill.Sarah McCullochBorehamwood, HertfordshireLike Dave Sowry’s wife, my sister-in-law also died with the help of Dignitas. She was in the final stages of untreatable mesothelioma, and had access to the best possible palliative care, but knew that even with that, the process of dying would be frightening as she gasped for breath. Gordon Brown (It is not too late to put the brakes on assisted dying, and focus on what is really needed, 2 December) is right to argue for more funding for hospices to make them more accessible, but that still doesn’t address the issue that people want a change in the law to allow people to make a choice about the manner and timing of their death.I am sure I am not alone in opposing the lords’ use of their unelected privilege to subvert the expressed will of those who wish to see this bill passed. We are capable of managing the risks. I have tried to convey my concerns about the lords’ obfuscation through their 1,000-plus amendments to the Speaker of the House of Lords without success.Jean FarrerBerkhamsted, HertfordshireThe data cited by Gordon Brown in his argument against assisted dying make for grim reading. But it’s the people behind the data that matter most. A gentleman we recently spoke to said he’d have gladly accepted an assisted death while in his local hospital. For all the efforts of the staff, his pain was unmanaged. He wanted to die.Once in the care of his local hospice, though, he changed his view. He enjoyed several more weeks with family and friends close by. That same hospice, like most, regularly turns patients away. It can’t afford to run services in line with demand. This same heartbreaking decision is happening thousands of times each year.And so while there is a legitimate discussion about the clinical limitations of palliation, we should be clear that the limiting factor on palliative care in this country is not medical science, but how the service is planned, delivered and paid for.Hospices are collectively neutral on whether assisted dying should be an available choice. But the question which parliamentarians must reckon with, is how to guarantee, as close to practically possible, that no one makes that choice because of a fear of not getting the care they need.Charlie KingDirector of External Affairs, Hospice UKHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It is worth remembering that Wales does not have a women’s prison. Women given custodial sentences in Wales are sent to prisons in England (Cheshire or Gloucestershire, for example). This clearly has a negative impact on families, especially children.The Welsh government’s preventive and trauma-informed approach favours the creation of residential women’s centres as a community-based alternative to short prison sentences. A pioneering project in Swansea, in development with the Ministry of Justice, is shockingly delayed. It can’t come soon enough for the hundreds of Welsh women (the majorityof whom are themselves victims of domestic abuse or trauma) currently serving sentences several hours away from their families.Mary WrennLlandenny, MonmouthshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I joined the NHS as a research fellow at a large teaching hospital after completing my PhD in public health. I wanted to make a more meaningful impact in the most deprived communities in England but, after two gruelling years of continuous bullying by senior leadership, I was forced to leave.If I could describe my time at the hospital, it would be soul-destroying – not from working with extremely poor and marginalised communities, but from the toxic culture imposed by senior management.Bullyingwas widespread, with senior management (who were mostly consultants that had pivoted to research) being the main instigators. On day one I was told that I was going to be made to work “until I drop” by my manager. I had comments made about clothing, which followed the dress code but was labelled “too bright” and “parrot-like”. I tried speaking up, and quickly realised that the director was just as much part of the bullying as the rest. I left and have never looked back.Your article about Blackpool misses an important point: bullying and harassment cannot be fixed if those in charge are the main instigators. The NHS is in need of a major overhaul. We know Blackpool is not an isolated case. Years ago, we all learned about thesurgeon who burned his initials on patients’ livers. To me, this is not just an indication of a remnant culture of 20th-century clinical elitism, but also of a systemic problem in how the NHS currently operates.Working in theNHSis hard and mentally draining. It should come as no surprise then that those in power turn to bullying to deal with the effects of poor organisational structure. You can implement procedures all you like, but until you create an environment where staff have access to all the necessary resources to do their job, you will not fix bullying.Name and address suppliedHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Everything was fine at the beginning of November, results forReal Madridexcellent. Since when precious little has gone his way. The manager desperately needed something here. When this latest game eluded him, it was easy to fear the worst. Time is not a commodity afforded to men in his position.Alonso has now won twice in eight matches in all competitions and the pain was deep, the frustration given an extra twist by the reality that his players did put it in for him. They were unable to bend the occasion to their will. The margins were against them.Madueke and Martinelli wondergoals make it perfect six for Arsenal at Club BruggeRead moreFor Pep Guardiola, there was simply satisfaction. The Manchester City manager had arrived in Madrid needing a responseto the home defeat against Bayer Leverkusenin the previous Champions League game.Guardiola got his lineup wrong that night and he took no chances on a return to a venue that has inspired so many emotions for him over the years, going as strong with it as possible. The result was a come-from-behind victory that tasted extremely sweet. It was not a vintage City performance and yet there was still plenty to like about it. Not least the scoreline. City were good enough.Madrid were set fair when Rodrygo scored for the first time in 33 club-level appearances and ran into an embrace with Alonso during the celebrations. Much would be made of that.But the whistles from the home fans would be shrill when it was all over. Nico O’Reilly equalised for City, his firstChampions Leaguegoal embellishing a thrusting display and Erling Haaland scored what proved to be the winner from the penalty spot.View image in fullscreenRodrygo fires Real Madrid in front during the first half.Photograph: Kieran McManus/ShutterstockMadrid fought and they had the chances to pinch something, not least when the substitute, Endrick, headed against the crossbar in the closing stages. Alonso had introduced him for the central defender, Raúl Asencio, in an all or nothing move. Ultimately, it was nothing. Alonso grasped for the positives in the aftermath. The footballing gods are not in his corner.It was Alonso’s 22nd game in charge and among his problems was a defensive injury crisis plus Kylian Mbappé being unfit. The striker was named among the substitutes, but when he did not warm up before the kick-off it was revealing. He would remain on the bench.Everybody had expected goals and the initial exchanges suggested they were a racing certainty. Alonso almost got the early one he craved when Vinícius Júnior swayed one way and then the other on the edge of the City area and was fouled by Matheus Nunes’s swiping challenge. The referee, Clément Turpin, pointed to the penalty spot only for the video assistant referee to rule that the offence was fractionally outside the area. Federico Valverde’s free‑kick deflected and flashed past the far post.Madrid did not look like a team in crisis at the outset. There was a fluidity about them, width on both sides. Jude Bellingham had the licence to roam; ditto Vinícius. Madrid were able to stretch City.Vinícius went close on seven minutes, dinking wide from Rodrygo’s glorious low cross and the breakthrough had been advertised. When Álvaro Carreras sparked a break from left-back, having wrestled Bernardo Silva off the ball, Madrid worked it via Bellingham out right to Rodrygo. He was too quick for the covering O’Reilly. The finish was arrowed into the far corner.And relax? Hardly. The vulnerabilities of this Madrid team were stamped all over the remainder of the first half, their descent from a position of strength startling. They would have been 3-1 down by the interval had Thibaut Courtois not made a double save to keep out Haaland and Rayan Cherki after O’Reilly had crossed from the left.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

[an overseas match] is still our goal. We keep getting closer and hope soon we will achieve it.\"La Liga had proposed hosting a match between Barcelona and Villarreal at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium in December, but the plan collapsed amid fierce criticism, player protests and legal challenges. Real Madrid filed complaints with Spain's sports ministry, accusing the league and Spanish FA of bypassing clubs.\"One match out of 380 matches is nothing, and it would really help us grow our audiovisual product,\" Tebas said. \"And not just in the US; we'd also love to bring [a La Liga game] to Saudi Arabia. It is still our objective, and each time we've got closer to achieving it. The next time, we trust we will achieve it.\"ReutersWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The match turned when Josko Gvardiol rose above Bellingham to work Courtois from Cherki’s corner; the goalkeeper could only shovel the ball out to O’Reilly who shot home. Madrid argued that Rúben Dias had fouled Antonio Rüdiger, Mbappé gesturing at the numerous screens up in the rafters to make the point. The offence was not there.O’Reilly was involved in the goal for 2-1 and so was Rüdiger, who endured a difficult night. Guardiola would say he was fortunate not to collect a second yellow card in the second half. When O’Reilly crossed, Haaland was too sharp with his movement and Rüdiger seemed to panic, grabbing him and falling on top of him. The only surprise was that Turpin did not give the penalty straight away. He needed a nudge from the VAR. Haaland relished the responsibility from the spot.How much did Alonso’s players want to fight for him in the second half? It was a legitimate question given the leaks from the dressing room that indicated they have not exactly been enthused by him. They did fight, Bellingham blowing a golden chance for 2-2 when his chip was too heavy with only Gianluigi Donnarumma in front of him.City grew into the game. Cherki wanted to showcase his tricks and he almost helped his team to another goal; he narrowly missed Haaland with one pass. Jérémy Doku was brave and direct on the ball; Guardiola would lavish praise on him.Vinícius could not release Rodrygo on the hour, O’Reilly getting back to tackle and Madrid, gripped by increasing desperation, would push in the last 15 minutes. Vinícius headed off target and volleyed another chance high. When Endrick was denied by the woodwork, the writing was on the wall.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueReal MadridManchester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The England forward was subjected to a ridiculous online petition that opposed his move across London from Chelsea in the summer. But on a rare appearance on the right flank as Bukayo Saka was given a welcome rest, Madueke scored a fantastic individual goal before adding a second after half-time to set up a comfortable victory for Mikel Arteta’s side.It means Arsenal have become only the fifth English team to win their opening six matches of aChampions Leagueor European Cup campaign and now need only a point from their remaining two to rubber‑stamp their progress directly to the last 16, even if in reality it is already a formality thanks to their superior goal difference.Haaland seals Manchester City win at Real Madrid to leave Alonso on brinkRead moreMartinelli was not to be denied his moment either, as the Brazilian’s superb curling effort made him the first Arsenal player to score in five successive Champions League matches. His compatriot Gabriel Jesus made his first appearance in almost a year after an anterior cruciate ligament injury, meaning it was pretty much the perfect response that Arteta was looking for afterlosing their 18-match unbeaten recordon their last outing.“Unbelievable goal,” the Arsenal manager said of Madueke’s opener. “When you talk about individual quality and individual action and magic moments, that’s it. A player that is able to pick the ball that far, dribble past people and finish with the quality and the power that he’s done. The same as Martinelli as well. I think at this level you want to win games, you need individual players to step up and to do something different. So I’m very happy because now we have some players back in the frontline and you can tell how much better we are with them.”With Declan Rice not having travelled to Belgium because of illness, Arteta had suggested that he would look to rotate his starting lineup after the defeat by Aston Villa. But there was further bad news when he revealed before kick-off that Jurriën Timber had not recovered from a knock in time to play, meaning Christian Nørgaard and Piero Hincapié became the seventh central defensive partnership Arsenal have fielded this season.Given all that, it might not have been the best time to face aClub Bruggeside desperate to impress their new manager, Ivan Leko, after Nicky Hayen was sacked on Monday. Yet despite impressing in a 3-3 thriller against Barcelona earlier in the competition, their weakness has been at the back and Arsenal were ruthless in exploiting it. The pace of the former Wolves loanee Carlos Forbs was a constant handful for Myles Lewis-Skelly but the England left-back managed to get forward in the 21st minute and saw his wayward shot diverted on to the post by Hincapié’s quick thinking.View image in fullscreenNoni Madueke lets fly from the edge of the box to score Arsenal’s first goal in their 3-0 victory.Photograph: PA Wire via BelgaNot much appeared to be on when Madueke picked up the ball midway inside the Brugge half a minute later until a stunning piece of skill took him away from his marker. The England forward seemed to glide away from two more defenders before unleashing an unstoppable shot that went in off the crossbar.It was a goal worthy of winning any game, although Brugge continued to look dangerous, in particular through Forbs. David Raya denied the Portugal forward before Aleksandar Stankovic went close from distance. The hosts were growing in confidence. Christos Tzolis was able to find space inside the area just before half-time but Raya read his intentions before the Spaniard produced a brilliant full-length save to deny Stankovic again.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This time there was no way he could miss Martín Zubimendi’s brilliant cross from the left that picked him out unmarked at the back post.There was nothing simple about Martinelli’s personal piece of history soon afterwards as the Brazilian – who had previously scored against Athletic Bilbao, Olympiakos, Atlético Madrid and Bayern Munich – cut in from the left flank and unleashed an unstoppable curling shot to make it 3-0.Jesus almost capped his return with a goal but saw his strike cannon back off the crossbar. Marli Salmon, who starred alongside Max Dowman for Arsenal Under-18s last season, became the fourth youngest player to appear for the club at just 16 years and 102 days and looked the part for the final stages as his side took another significant step towards potential silverware.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueClub BruggeArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

There’s frustration but we’re hopefully moving in the right direction.”Newcastle’s manager saw his side fall apart – and behind – at an early corner and now must address his players’ vulnerability to set pieces ahead of Sunday’s Premier League Tyne-Wear derby at Sunderland. Then there is the question of whether the suddenly jaded Sandro Tonali should be replaced by the impressive Lewis Miley at the Stadium of Light.Howe had been expecting a tactical technical area duel with Kasper Hjulmand but Bayer Leverkusen’s manager was absent for personal reasons.That left his assistant, Rogier Meijer, to take charge of the team currently fourth in Germany’s top tier. Meijer must have been extremely content with a first half ­characterised by much slick, sharp, passing and movement as his pleasingly fluid side constantly interchanged positions.They were ahead in the 13th minute after Newcastle got themselves into a terrible tangle at a corner.When Leverkusen’s captain, Robert Andrich, dodged Tonali he was left free to direct a header goalwards. Its journey took a detour via Bruno Guimarães’s backside and the deflection left a well beaten Ramsdale thoroughly deceived. Although Andrich claimed the credit it was a Guimarães own goal.“We gave ourselves a mountain to climb,” said Howe. “But my players deserve credit for coming back.”Shortly afterwards things very nearly took another wrong turn for Newcastle. Once Patrik Schick met Malik Tillman’s fine through ball and accelerated towards the area a wrong-footed Malick Thiaw ended up felling Schick on the edge of the area.View image in fullscreenLewis Miley heads Newcastle into the lead.Photograph: Ulrik Pedersen/NurPhoto/ShutterstockThe referee initially awarded a penalty but downgraded it to a free-kick when a video assistant referee review detected the offence had occurred fractionally outside the 18-yard box. A relieved Thiaw, meanwhile, was shown a yellow card before watching Leverkusen’s set-piece specialist, Grimaldo, lift the ensuring free-kick over the crossbar. “We maybe had a bit of luck with Malick and the penalty,” Howe conceded. “That was a big moment.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even so, the home goalkeeper, Mark Flekken, did extremely well to prevent an equaliser when Grimaldo deflected Tino Livramento’s cross goalwards.Howe’s problem was that, whenever the hosts broke, his defenders looked bewildered in the face of Schick’s habit of dropping deep and dragging them out of position while leaving Tillman and Ernest Poku free to burst into the box.With half-time beckoning Thiaw – who, uncharacteristically, was struggling badly – and company had Ramsdale to thank for a stunning fingertip save from Jarell Quansah, whose advance from the back three and connection with Arthur’s right-wing delivery had proceeded unchecked.Then, five minutes, into the second half Leverkusen, or more specifically Flekken, self-destructed. As the former Brentford goalkeeper prepared to clear, he lost concentration and dawdled, permitting Woltemade to not merely close him down but, courtesy of some seriously nifty footwork, dispossess him.Flekken responded by pushing Woltemade over and Anthony Gordon made no mistake from the penalty spot. As Gordon celebrated his fifth Champions League goal this season the mortified keeper pulled his jersey over his face.There was to be no hiding place for Flekken though and he was very nearly beaten again when Gordon’s shot rebounded off the inside of a post.Miley, who had just replaced the injured Joelinton in midfield, thought he had won it when he headed Gordon’s cross home before Grimaldo eased a little of Flekken’s pain by enjoying the final word.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueBayer LeverkusenNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

You can see from the league standings that the points are so close, so you’ve got to take every opportunity that you get.”Making her first appearance since a frustrating 1-1 draw with Liverpool on 16 November, Bright returned to the starting XI for Sonia Bompastor’s team after two games sat on the bench. Bright was one of six changes to the Chelsea side defeated 1-0 by Everton on Sunday.Quick GuideRoundup: Pajor keeps Barcelona in top spotShowEwa Pajor (pictured) was on target for Barcelona in a 3-1 home win over Benfica that all but guarantees their place in the Women's Champions League quarter-finals.Pajor opened the scoring just before the half four – her 15th in 16 appearances in the tournament's group or league phase. According to Uefa, only Chelsea striker Kerr has more at this stage of the Champions League, with 16 goals.Chandra Davidson equalized for Benfica just after half-time, but two goals in the space of four minutes effectively sealed the win for Barcelona. Christy Ucheibe turned Alexia Putellas' cross into her own net in the 54th minute, and Laia Aleixandri forced the ball home to make it 3-1.There was still time for Barça to win a penalty, but Benfica keeper Lena Pauels saved well to deny Putellas. Victory means Barcelona top the league phase with one game to go, three points clear of Real Madrid in fifth and Juventus in sixth, with a vastly superior goal difference.Twelve teams advance from the league phase, with the top four going straight to the quarter-finals and the other eight sides entering playoffs.Paris FC, who host Barça in their final game, boosted their hopes of a playoff place as a late Lorena Azzaro penalty at Vålerenga, who had Karina Saevik was sent off.Bayern Munichsit fourth after battling to a 2-2 draw atAtlético Madrid. The hosts started well and took the lead through Vilde Bøe Risa's penalty, with Giulia Gwinn missing a spot kick for the visitors.Pernille Harder levelled just after the hour and then volleyed Bayern in front with 12 minutes to go, but Fiamma's stunning late strike crashed in off the bar to earn Atlético a point and all but assure them of a playoff place.AP/Guardian sportPhotograph: Quality Sport Images/Getty Images EuropeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I want to be on the pitch, I want to be playing, but it’s more important we came out with the right attitude, right mentality. Getting a clean sheet is what we want,” Bright said.Bompastor said: “I really liked her performance and I’m pleased for Millie. It’s never an easy position to be put in by the decisions I’ve made … the perfect answer you can give to a manager is the performance tonight on the pitch.”Chelsea started brightly at Stamford Bridge and Roma, despite a disappointing Champions League campaign which means they are unable to progress beyond the league phase, looked like they wanted to make a statement early on, with Giulia Dragoni and Rinsola Babajide effective on the right.View image in fullscreenJohanna Rytting Kaneryd scores Chelsea’s third goal from close range before half-time.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersAn shot from the captain, Manuela Giugliano, flew over the bar from distance in their best effort of an open 10 minutes but their hard work was undone in the 13th minute, as Valentina Bergamaschi headed powerfully into her own net after Sandy Baltimore’s cross evaded Sam Kerr. It was a hammer blow for the visiting team and momentum swung Chelsea’s way. It was two before the half-hour, Rytting Kaneryd headed the ball into the middle and Kerr stepped away to allow Kaptein to fire in.It was a deserved lead and the Blues extended it shortly before the break, Olivie Lukasova saved from Kerr after Niamh Charles’s ball in but Rytting Kaneryd was at the far post to turn in.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nüsken converted from the spot to put Chelsea four up.Bompastor’s side were ruthless in their pursuit of more goals, the defeat by Everton perhaps lighting a fire in frustrated bellies after they handed Manchester City a six-point advantage at the top of the Women’s Super League table.“It’s probably about players’ confidence and the quality of the team we are facing,” the manager said when asked why the goals came so comprehensively against Roma but not against Everton or in their preceding 1-1 draw with Liverpool.The home team’s fifth arrived via Maika Hamano, Guro Reiten’s run exposing the chaotic Roma backline. She collected Bright’s ball over the top before prodding it to the Japanese midfielder to send past Lukasova. The sixth came from the veteran defender Lucy Bronze.Job done, a trip to the two‑time Champions League winners Wolfsburg in Chelsea’s final match of the group phase next Wednesday is the only thing standing between Bompastor’s side and an automatic place in the last eight.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueChelsea WomenRoma WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Yes, Christmas at Alexandra Palace is always a good time for spotting superheroes. But only one of them will not be wearing a costume.In fact, it is when he is in his normal human clothes, doing normal human things, thatLuke Littlerlooks at his most incongruous. Standing with his fellow Manchester United fans in the away end at Molineux. Proudly brandishing a fresh driving certificate after finally passing his test. And it is in these more unguarded moments that you remember that the man they call The Nuke, the phenomenon who has detonated the sport of darts, is really still just a kid, a regular lad from Warrington with a deeply irregular talent.Michael van Gerwen: ‘Of course I love darts, but I love my kids much more’Read moreTwo years after the tournament that changed everything for ever, Littler returns to north Londonas the defending champion, the world No 1, the indisputable titan of the game. The UK Open champion, the World Matchplay champion, the World Grand Prix champion, the double Grand Slam winner, the Players Championship Finals winner. He has won more than twice as much ranking money as his closest competitor. But he would trade it all in for a successful title defence on 3 January, becoming the first man to retain the world title since Gary Anderson a decade ago.And frankly, who will stop him? Who might stop him? Who genuinely believes theycanstop him? Over the months an irresistible aura seems to have grown around the boy king, a relentless consistency on both rings, a sense of inevitability and predestination that paralyses his opponents’ game and stirs his own, the unswerving belief that he can win from any position, in whatever way he wants.Two sets down to Gerwyn Price at the World Grand Prix, 7-2 down to Jermaine Wattimena at the World Matchplay, 5-0 down to James Wade in the final of the same tournament, 9-6 down to Josh Rock at the Grand Slam. Each time Littler looked down but never did he look truly beaten, aware – as was everyone else – that there is not a player on earth who can live with his surges of acceleration, those bursts of four and five-visit legs that leave a trail of utter devastation in their wake.View image in fullscreenLuke Humphries (left) has been overtaken by Luke Littler in the world rankings.Photograph: John Walton/PAEvery single member of the chasing pack bears the scars of multiple Littler maulings. Luke Humphries, the world No 2 and still theoretically his closest challenger, had a cathartic victory over Littlerin the Premier League finalin May but has since lost to him in three straight finals. Michael van Gerwen has lost eight of his past 11 against him, including last year’s bruising world final. Price has been defeated seven times in a row. Rock has never beaten him.And so, paradoxically, the biggest threat to a Littler coronation may lie earlier in the draw, in the shorter format games, before the teenage terror has had time to build a head of steam. Last year Ryan Meikle and Ryan Joyce gave him more trouble than anyone else later in the tournament. Darius Labanauskas of Lithuania, his first-round opponent this time, can be safely discounted. But Joe Cullen or Bradley Brooks could lurk dangerously in round three, while his potential fourth-round opponent, Damon Heta, can boast a nine-darter on the Alexandra Palace stage.Quick GuideThree challengers … and a dark horseShowLuke HumphriesThe 2024 champion remains Littler’s closest rival and beat him to this year’s Premier League title, although has looked a little weary in recent months, losing his last three major finals – and the world No 1 ranking.Gerwyn PriceOne of the few players with both the game and the personality to rattle Littler. But it’s been three years since his last major title, and there remain questions over his consistency in the longer formats.Josh RockThe rise of Littler has allowed this former youth prodigy to rebuild his game under the radar, and a stunning World Cup win with Northern Ireland displayed his ability to perform under pressure. Has all the talent, but still awaiting his big breakthrough.Dirk van DuijvenbodeVolatile, larger-than-life Dutchman whose promising career was derailed by a persistent shoulder injury. Now back to full fitness and showing cautious glimpses of his scintillating, 180-hungry best.Jonathan LiewWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.If the crown unexpectedly slips, who might instead pounce? Humphries, Van Gerwen, Price and Rock look best-placed, and to those you might add the brilliant young Dutchman Gian van Veen, the only man with a winning head-to-record against Littler on the senior tour. Beyond those a second tier of candidates might include Stephen Bunting, Nathan Aspinall, Chris Dobey, Anderson, Jonny Clayton, Danny Noppert and James Wade. Meanwhile the former champions Michael Smith, Rob Cross and Peter Wright have all endured torrid years and while all are capable of springing a shock on their day, it’s hard to envisage any of them going the distance.Asfor Beau Greaves, the greatest female talent the sport has ever seen, it is probably best to restrain the hype train for a few more days. Her dominance of the Women’s Series has been extraordinary, her talent is frightening and at last month’s Grand Slam she ran Anderson and Van Gerwen achingly close. But she is still learning her trade on the big stage, the consistency and composure and killer instinct that will determine her true ceiling. She plays double major champion Daryl Gurney in round one. If she gets past that test, you officially have permission to get excited.View image in fullscreenBeau Greaves is the greatest female talent the sport has seen.Photograph: Ben Roberts Photo/Getty ImagesBut the rise of Greaves, one of a record five women in this year’s tournament, is symbolic of a broader trend in the sport. Gradually and by degrees, darts has broken out of its traditional demographic and laid down roots on every continent. The field takes in the 18-year-old Littler and the 71-year-old veteran Paul Lim; Kenya and Argentina are represented for the first time; German fans make up a quarter of all ticket sales at this year’s tournament. There will be YouTube stars and influencers in the crowd, record-breaking audiences on television, a new generation of players who learned their trade not in the pub or the working man’s club but the bedroom and the live stream.Truly this is a sport for everyone, and with a prize to match. Along with the Sid Waddell Trophy this year’s winner will take home a record £1m, the biggest jackpot ever seen in the sport, around double the prize for winning the Tour de France or the world snooker championship.And perhaps this largesse strikes you as incongruous or absurd, an offensively large amount of money for throwing arrows into a wall. But then darts has always been a place of wild schemes and big dreams, where ordinary folk perform extraordinary feats. A palace built for the people; a stage fit for superheroes.Explore more on these topicsLuke LittlerDartsPDC World ChampionshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And while the International Olympic Committee insisted on Tuesday that everything would be ready on time, the NHL commissioner, Gary Bettman, made it clear he was not entirely happy.“The fact that the building at this point still isn’t completed is – and I won’t use any other adjectives – disappointing,” Bettman said.Meanwhile the NHL deputy commissioner, Bill Daly, warned organisers that the 14,700-seat arena had to be able to withstand three games in a day otherwise the players would not show up. “If the ice isn’t ready and it’s not safe, then we’re not going,” Daly said. “I mean, I think that’s pretty self-evident.”Construction delays have meant that there will be no ice in the arena before the new year – with the test event now being pushed back to 9-11 January. The IOC president, Kirsty Coventry, insisted that despite the hiccups, it would be a case of all right on the night.“We need to push through and continue until the very last moment,” she said. “But we’re very impressed, very happy with everything that we’re seeing and hearing. As we get close, we just need to keep our finger on the pulse in terms of the ice hockey rink.The IOC sports director, Pierre Ducrey, also insisted that concerns around the small rink size had now been “successfully resolved” with the NHL and its players. “So we are very happy with where we stand at present,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterOur picture editors select their favourite sporting images from the past week, from the spectacular to the powerful, and with a little bit of fun thrown inEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rainbow flags will also be allowed into the stadium byFifa.Egypt and Iran ask Fifa to prevent LGBTQ+ Pride celebration at World Cup 2026 matchRead moreHomosexuality is illegal in Iran, and in Egypt morality laws are often used to prosecute LGBTQ+ people. The Egyptian football federation said this week that it had written to Fifa’s general secretary to complain about the Pride Match, saying it did not want to be associated with celebrations that “directly contradict the cultural, religious and social values … in Arab and Islamic societies”. The head of Iran’s football federation, Mehdi Taj, was quoted by the local news agency ISNA as saying it too had raised “objections against the issue”.The organising committee for Seattle said in a statement that its plans for activities were outside the stadium and would go ahead. “As the local organising committee, SeattleFWC26’s role is to prepare our city to host the matches and manage the city experience outside of Seattle Stadium,” said Hana Tedesse, the vice-president of communications for Seattle FifaWorld Cup 2026.“SeattleFWC26 is moving forward as planned with our community programming outside the stadium during Pride weekend and throughout the tournament, partnering with LGBTQ+ leaders, artists and business owners to elevate existing Pride celebrations across Washington.”Fifa has operational control of stadiums on matchdays, and it is understood there have been no plans in place to acknowledge Pride weekend inside the ground. Although Fifa prohibits banners and flags with political messages from being taken into stadiums during the tournament, it allows flags expressing “sporting and social symbols”, which includes the rainbow flag. This policy was applied at the lastWorld Cupin Qatar, and reinforced after reports of rainbow flags being seized by local authorities.The Pride Match concept was devised by the Seattle committee and highlights “our city’s proud history of advocating for equality” while the world’s eyes are on the city. It has commissioned a design contest to create images to commemorate the occasion, with one webpage illustrated by a photo of the rainbow flag being paraded through Seattle Stadium.Tedesse said the organising committee would work to ensure all fans felt welcome in the city during the 48-team tournament next summer. “The Pacific Northwest is home to one of the nation’s largest Iranian‑American communities, a thriving Egyptian diaspora and rich communities representing all nations we’re hosting in Seattle,” she said in a statement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lyonnes are now all but guaranteed of their place in that quartet and they demonstrated a gulf in quality between themselves and the Women’s Super League side.Skinner’s team selection raised eyebrows, not least because of the surprise inclusion of Rachel Williams as the central striker. The 37‑year‑old veteran’s involvement came while creative midfielders such as Ella Toone and Jess Park were left on the substitutes bench. Skinner said: “You can lose a game against Lyonnes on set-pieces, on physicality, so we had to have balance. We looked at four games in 10 days, so we’ve got to be able to rotate.“I won’t have anyone go ‘Oh, well, you don’t rotate’ and then you do rotate and it’s not right, so, you’ve got to. There’s got to be a plan ahead of all of the games coming. But we needed to match them physically and then adapt it and change it in the second half.

Their arrivals did prompt an injection of fresh intensity into the midfield, but Lyonnes were still creating dangerous chances, with Ada Hegerberg lashing narrowly wide with her left foot around the hour.The record eight-time European champions –who won away at Arsenal, the defending champions, in October and whose only dropped points came in an away draw at Juventus – have looked genuine contenders to go all the way this season and their composure on the ball only added to that impression.Dumornay was already the star of the show before she produced two late finishes of the highest quality, first collecting a Jule Brand cut-back and finding the top corner expertly in the 81st minute, before another equally clinical finish as the clock ticked past the 90th minute. At the other end, the hosts had failed to produce a single effort on target.Skinner described Lyonnes as “probably one of the best teams that will ever walk the planet”, as he played down the significance of the defeat.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueManchester United WomenOL LyonnesWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The 34-year-old double Rugby World Cup winner also appeared to distance himself from the act by drawing attention to “other factors”. Along with three videos accompanying the post, Etzebeth claimed two Welsh players involved in the fracas, along with Mann, changed “the dynamic of the entire picture”.South Africa’s Eben Etzebeth handed 12-week ban for eye-gouging against WalesRead moreEtzebeth will be sidelined until April after an 18-week ban, for what was deemed a mid-range offence, was reduced to 12 weeks due to mitigating factors including his previous good disciplinary record.“I’ve been quiet, but now that my hearing is done, I think I owe everyone an explanation,” Etzebeth wrote. “I accept guilt. I made a mistake and I’m willing to serve a suspension which I deserve …“I don’t want young kids who look up to the Springboks to think that it’s OK to eye gouge someone, because it’s not, but unfortunately mistakes happen … I would never do something like this on purpose, I know what the consequences will be after playing rugby for a few years.”As in his evidence to the ­disciplinary hearing, Etzebeth said he had been struck by Mann in his neck/chin area, which was not spotted by the officials, before retaliating with an open-handed blow.“You can clearly see my first point of contact is against his shoulder with an open hand, just like he did, except he got me on the chin,” Etzebeth wrote.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And we said, before we go to a meeting, we want to know some things,” Trump said. “They would like us to go to a meeting over the weekend in Europe, and we’ll make a determination depending on what they come back with. We don’t want to be wasting time”.A British readout of the call said that all leaders agreed it was a “critical moment” and “intensive work on the peace plan is continuing and will continue in the coming days.”Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, will be on Thursday’s call, along with Starmer, Macron and Merz, whohad a meeting in Downing Street on Monday. They will be joined by numerous other leaders of nations supporting Ukraine.Zelenskyy, was expected to hand over a revised version of a peace plan to US negotiators on Wednesday before the call with leaders and officials from about 30 countries.“This week may bring news for all of us,” Zelenskyywroteon X. “We believe that peace has no alternative, and the key questions are how to compel Russia to stop the killings and what specifically will deter Russia from a third invasion.The European leaders have also been working to draw up security guarantees forUkrainein the event a peace deal is struck, though it is far from clear any western nations are willing to offer meaningful guarantees against further Russian aggression in the event of a peace deal.‘He served with honour’: Starmer pays tribute to British soldier killed in UkraineRead moreTrump has vacillated between appearing supportive and dismissive of Ukraine since taking office at the beginning of this year, but hisrecent peace drive on terms that seem beneficial to Russia, combined witha new US national security strategy that attacks European nations, has worried allies. In a repeat of previous cycles of Trump-led peace efforts, Zelenskyy has mobilised European leaders to come to his assistance when under pressure from the US president.Trump claimed earlier in the week that Zelenskyy had not even read his draft peace plan. “Russia is, I believe, fine with it, but I’m not sure that Zelenskyy is fine with it,” said Trump.Numerous Russian officials have praised the Trump team’s peace efforts, and Vladimir Putin welcomed the White House envoys Steve Witkoff andJared Kushnerfor five hours of talks in the Kremlin last week. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Trump was the only western leader with “an understanding of the reasons that made war in Ukraine inevitable”.But sceptics say there is little sign that Russia is ready to sign a peace deal, even on the terms proposed by the White House, which include Kyiv giving up control ofthe entire Donbas region. Putin has instead said repeatedly that Moscow wants a “comprehensive settlement” to the conflict.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But clearly feeling pressured by statements from Trump and others in his orbit, Zelenskyy said on Tuesday evening he was “ready for elections”. He said he would ask the US to supply proposals on how to hold a vote safely and request that MPs prepare legislation to allow an election.“I am asking … the United States to help me, possibly together with European colleagues, to ensure security for the elections, and then in the next 60 to 90 days Ukraine will be ready to hold the elections. I personally have the will and readiness for this,” Zelenskyy said.On the frontline, Russia continued its assaults on the city of Pokrovsk and nearby Myrnohrad on Wednesday. The Ukrainian military said Russia was using “armoured vehicles, cars and motorcycles” to storm the northern part of Pokrovsk from the morning. Russia has already claimed control of the whole city but Kyiv says it holds the northern part.On Tuesday, Russia’s top general, Valery Gerasimov, said Moscow’s forces now controlled 30% of nearby Myrnohrad and that Putin had ordered them to complete the takeover of the town. A Ukrainian military source who had just returned from Myrnohrad confirmed that street battles are going on in the town. “It’s absolute hell,” said the source.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeKeir StarmerVolodymyr ZelenskyyFriedrich MerzEmmanuel MacronRussianewsShareReuse this content"

Everyone who has stolen from this country will return every last cent and be held to account.” The vice-president is a former police officer who became famous on TikTok for making alleged corruption accusations.The state broadcaster Bolivia TVpostedthat Arce was “giving a statement before” the police “while staff from the office of the ombudsman accompany him”. It noted the involvement of the Special Force to Fight Crime’s department for the investigation of illicit gains.Outside the headquarters of the FELCC in the capital, La Paz, where the former president had supposedly been taken, Tejada told journalists she was trying to enter the building to obtain more information.She said Arce “was alone” in the Sopocachi neighbourhood of La Paz, when he was allegedly “put into a minibus with blacked-out windows” and taken to the FELCC.“I’m arriving now to find out … No, there was no notification of any kind, and I’m coming to see under what procedures they brought him here,” she added.Tejada said she learned from “unofficial sources” that the reason for the detention “would be the Indigenous fund case”, referring to a government fund intended to channel part of hydrocarbon tax revenues into development projects for Indigenous peoples.During the early years of the administration of the former presidentEvo Morales, under whom Arce served as finance minister, Bolivia experienced astonishing growth, lifting thousands out of poverty – particularly many Indigenous and rural communities – thanks to a natural gas boom.The “Indigenous fund” was shut down in 2015 after a corruption scandal involving the alleged misappropriation of resources.Investigations were revived after Paz Pereira took office – the president established at least10 commissionsto audit and investigate Mas administrations, one of them focused on the “Indigenous fund”.Last Friday, the former Mas deputy Lidia Patty was also arrested by the FELCC. She is accused of having received, in her personal account, funds for the execution of projects that were never carried out.Local media reported that, in the request for Arce’s detention, the public prosecutor Miguel Ángel Cardozo alleged that when Arce was economy minister he had “violated existing regulations by authorising the transfer of public funds into personal accounts”.Explore more on these topicsBoliviaAmericasEvo MoralesnewsShareReuse this content"

We continue to be more efficient and absorb increasing costs where possible”.Toffee Crisp was created in 1963 by John Henderson, the great-nephew of the man known as the toffee king John Mackintosh.Blue Riband, which draws its name from the prestigious transatlantic liner award, was launched in 1936 by Gray Dunn & Co in Scotland, a subsidiary of Rowntree’s, later becoming part of Nestlé in 1988.The cost of chocolate has increased sharply as cocoa prices have soared after poor harvests in the key growing regions of Ghana and Ivory Coast over the past three years, amid extreme temperatures and unusual rainfall patterns driven by the climate crisis.In October, McVitie’s reduced the amount of cocoa in the recipes of Club and Penguin bars so much they are now only “chocolate flavour” after parent company Pladis chose to use cheaper alternatives to the main ingredient in chocolate.Chocolate pricesin Britain rose 18.4%compared with last year, analysts at the market research firm Worldpanel said on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsChocolateFoodNestléFood & drink industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Once a vast white artery feeding rivers, fields and forests, it is now retreating steadily, leaving bare rock, crevassed ice and newly exposed alpine meadows.The glacier’s meltwater has sustained paddy fields, apple orchards, saffron fields and grazing pastures for centuries. Now, as its ice diminishes, the entire web of life it supported is shifting.Alpine flowers bloom earlier, confusing pollinators. Musk deer and ibex lose grazing grounds, and snow leopards are increasingly spotted near villages as they run out of food to hunt.For scientists, Kolahoi represents one of the most dramatic ecological changes in the region. Shepherds report shrinking grasslands and shifting streams that affect livestock.“Even the animals seem confused by the changing landscape,” says Mohammad Siraj Khan, a 55-year-old shepherd.We couldn’t irrigate even half the crop. This didn’t happen even during the worst years of the 1990sAbdul Gani Dar, farmerHistorical records show that Kolahoi has been shrinking since the mid-19th century. A2020 satellite assessmentfound it had lost almost a quarter of its area over nearly six decades, while its snout had retreated about 900 meters since 1978. Between 1980 and 2018, agricultural land in the glacier’s Lidder watershed fell by almost 40%, reflecting the direct link between glacial retreat and water availability.“This glacier is the lifeline of the Lidder and Sind rivers,” says researcher Labeeb Gulzar. “Its loss could reshape the future of Kashmir’s water, agriculture and ecosystems.”View image in fullscreenThe changing glacier could reshape rivers, such as the Lidder, which in turn affects agricultural land and surrounding ecosystems.Photograph: Yawar Nazir/Getty ImagesThe shifts are transforming landscapes and communities across the region, says Dr Talib Bashir Bhat, a research scholar at Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology of Kashmir (Skuast). “Changes in glacier melt and snowline elevation alter river flows, affecting irrigation, orchards and pastures, linking the glacier directly to biodiversity and livelihoods.”He says alpine plants face changes as lower-elevation species move into newly exposed land, altering the delicate balance of ecosystems.Rising temperatures and pollution from vehicles, wood burning and construction all darken the ice, accelerating its melt. Deforestation and growing tourist infrastructure in the upper catchment have worsened the problem.‘Like walking through time’: as glaciers retreat, new worlds are being created in their wakeRead moreFor local farmers, the changes are tangible. “The canal dried up by late June, much earlier than usual,” says Abdul Gani Dar, from Pulwama.“We couldn’t irrigate even half the crop. This didn’t happen even during the worst years of the 1990s. Now the snow is gone, and the streams vanish before summer starts.”Scientific observations underline these concerns. Prof Shakil Ahmad Romshoo, vice-chancellor of the Islamic University of Science and Technology, says Kolahoi’s mass balance is highly sensitive to temperature. “For every 1C rise, it loses about 0.65 metres of ice thickness annually,” he says.Now and then slider of the retreating glacier in 2007 and 2015The snout of the Kolahoi glacier in 2007 and 2015, when rocks are visibleAll 18,000 glaciers in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh are melting, and the pace of retreat is increasing.“We have lost 25-30% of glaciers in the past 60 years and could lose up to 70% by the end of this century if the trend continues,” says Dr Irfan Rashid, assistant professor at the University of Kashmir. He says projections indicate a temperature rise of 4C to 7C by century’s end, making further retreat inevitable.View image in fullscreenThe habitat of the Kashmir stag, or hangul, is being degraded as the glacier shrinks.Photograph: Hindustan Times/Sipa USA/AlamyAnimal habitats are being lost as the makeup of vegetation shifts. Only about7% of the western Himalayas is nowsuitable musk deer habitat, and this may shrink further by 2030 due to grazing and deforestation.“Human activity is shrinking the spaces where musk deer can survive,” says forest guard Danish Ahmad.The Kashmir stag, or hangul, has also been affected, says Dr Mir Muskan Un Nisa, who studies forestry at Skuast.“Shrinking glaciers change water systems, forests and grasslands, causing wetlands to dry and vegetation patterns to shift,” she says.“These changes degrade habitats that the hangul relies on for food and shelter. Reduced water availability and altered climatic conditions push animals closer to human settlements, increasing risks of conflict, poaching and habitat loss. Glacial melting threatens the survival of sensitive species and disrupts the balance of ecosystems in the region.”The pattern is mirrored across the Himalayas. In Nepal, the Yala glacier has lost more than66% of its volumeand is expected to vanish by 2040.View image in fullscreenResearchers build a weather station on Yala glacier, which has lost more than two thirds of its volume.Photograph: Jitendra Raj Bajracharya/ICIMOD/ReutersAcross mountain ranges, ice loss creates a new world: rivers that run earlier in spring, alpine meadows colonised by pioneer species, and wildlife adjusting to shrinking habitats. Some species retreat upward, others move toward villages, and humans adapt to water shortages and changing landscapes. The glacier’s fading ice is not just a retreat of frozen water but a reminder of the interconnectedness of water, wildlife and human life in Kashmir.Each summer, the silence above Pahalgam deepens: fewer birds, fewer grazing animals, less snow.Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsGlaciersThe age of extinctionKashmirConservationBiodiversityWildlifeFarmingAccess to waterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This includes atranche of 30 peers announced last December, and seven who have been created so that they can take up ministerial roles.The decision is likely to draw criticism from electoral reform campaigners who argue that the appointment process is undemocratic and used by prime ministers to reward their allies.Labour committed in its manifesto to modernising the Lords by reforming the appointments process, introducing a mandatory retirement age of 80, and ultimately replacing the Lords with “an alternative second chamber that is more representative of the regions and nations”.Party figures argue that the composition of the Lords needs to be rebalanced in its favour so that the government can push ahead with implementing its legislative agenda.A Labour source said: “⁠The Tories stuffed the House of Lords, creating a serious imbalance that has allowed them to frustrate our plans to make working families better off. This needs to be corrected to deliver on our mandate from the British people.“We will continue to progress our programme of reform, which includes removing the right of hereditary peers to sit and vote in the Lords.”The Lords has been accused of blocking progress in a number of areas in recent months, including government legislation to strengthen renters’ rights, workers’ rights and abolish hereditary peers.The Conservatives appointed three new peers – the former Conservative MP and head of Margaret Thatcher’s policy unit John Redwood, the gender-critical campaigner and Olympic swimming silver medallist Sharron Davies, and the historian Simon Heffer.The Liberal Democrats appointed five, including the hereditary peers Dominic Hubbard and John Russell, who had faced removal from the upper chamber as their seats were being abolished.The others are Sarah Teather, who served as children’s minister between 2010 and 2012, Rhiannon Leaman, who has been Ed Davey’s chief of staff since 2019, and Mike Dixon, the party’s chief executive.Davey, the Lib Dem leader, said his party’s appointments would work to “deliver the change our country desperately needs, including reform of the House of Lords”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are 177 cross-benchers and 40 non-affiliated peers.Darren Hughes, the chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said​: “It is absurd for the Lords, which at more than 800 peers is already the second-largest legislative chamber after China’s National People’s Congress, to be getting even more members. It is also patently ridiculous that the government has now added more peers into the Lords than the 92 hereditary peers it is in the process of removing.​”David Cameron created 245 peers during his time in office, 120 of them in his first 18 months,according to the Lords library. Tony Blair created 374, more than any other prime minister, with 101 in his first 18 months.Boris Johnson created 87 peersdespite pledging to shrink the Lords. Theresa May created 43, Rishi Sunak created 51 and Liz Truss, who held power for just 49 days, created 29.Legislation to remove 91 hereditary peers from the upper chamber is going through parliament. The bill is in the final stages of parliamentary scrutiny, known as ping-pong, where it is batted back and forth between the Commons and Lords.Should it become law, it will remove 44 hereditary Tory peers from the red benches, but will still leave the opposition party with a majority over Labour.Angela Smith, Labour’s House of Lords leader, is due to begin the next stage in a series of changes to the upper chamber at the start of 2026.Explore more on these topicsHouse of LordsKeir StarmerLabourHonours systemLords reformnewsShareReuse this content"

We know that listening to parents saves lives. So it is especially concerning that the CQC found that these issues show no improvement since last year.”The survey also found that only 57% of people surveyed had “always” been able to get a member of staff to help them when needed after the birth of their child, while one in 10 said they could not access any help at all.Despite the concerns the survey raised, the results also indicated some improvements in maternity care. Almost nine in 10 (89%) of survey respondents said they had always been spoken to in a way they could understand, a 1% increase.The same proportion of respondents (89%) said they had been offered mental health support during pregnancy, compared with 83% in 2021.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These improvements reflect the dedication of midwives working hard to provide quality care.“These findings highlight the immense pressure midwives are working under due to chronic workforce shortages. When midwives are stretched too thin it becomes harder to provide the attentive care that allows them to truly listen and respond to concerns, especially when they’re often caring for multiple women simultaneously.”Dr Jyotsna Vohra, the director of research, programmes and impact at the pregnancy charity Tommy’s, said the results of the survey were “yet more evidence that families are being let down.“Just one day after the publication of Baroness Amos’s initial findings [from the National Maternity Investigation], which were deeply concerning, the results of this survey are yet more evidence that families are being let down,” Vohra said.“Pregnancy should be a time when women and birthing people feel safe and cared for. These results clearly show that too many people are not being heard and left alone at crucial moments”.Duncan Burton, the chief nursing officer for England, said: “It’s clear that too many women are still not receiving the care they need despite the signs of improvement that these results show, and I am determined to ensure every woman and their family is listened to and receives safe and compassionate care.“We have put in place dedicated teams across the country working to improve services, and we are introducing daily performance monitoring of every maternity service to ensure we can quickly intervene if issues arise.Explore more on these topicsNHSPregnancyChildbirthCare Quality Commission (CQC)HospitalsHealthRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

She has been with Mr Markle in hospital every day, providing him with care and support.“As soon as Mr Markle gave consent for his contact details, the name of his hospital and his room number to be provided to his daughter’s spokesman, Caroline shared them.“It is entirely untrue that each interaction has been broadcast, and the suggestion that Caroline has breached ethical boundaries is demonstrably false and vehemently denied.”It also follows a tense few days in which Meghan is understood to have been attempting to reach her father with a message. Her team claim they have struggled to locate him or find a way to reach him directly.The row comes weeks before the Duke of Sussex isdue to begin a lawsuit against the publisher of the Daily Mailover allegations of unlawful information gathering.Meghan has been estranged from her father since 2018, when she marriedPrince Harry. Markle was supposed to walk Meghan down the aisle, but pulled out of the ceremony because of health problems.The two were then engaged in a row over whether he had spoken to the press, and it later emerged he had worked with newspapers and staged paparazzi photographs before the wedding.The duchess has also said that a private letter she wrote to her father, extracts of which were published in the Mail on Sunday, begging him to stop talking to the media“actually signalled the end of our relationship, not a reconciliation”.In the court case scheduled for next month, the publisher of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday is being sued by Prince Harry, Sir Elton John, David Furnish, Liz Hurley, Sadie Frost, the campaigner Doreen Lawrence and the former politician Sir Simon Hughes.The claimants allege Associated Newspapers Limited carried out or commissioned unlawful activities such as hiring private investigators to place listening devices inside cars, “blagging” private records and accessing private phone conversations.

Instead, the inhabitants were probably early Neanderthals, based on fossils of around the same age from Swanscombe, Kent and Atapuerca, Spain, which preserve early Neanderthal DNA.View image in fullscreenArtist’s impression of sparks from flint and pyrite.Photograph: Craig Williams, the trustees of the British Museum“So early Neanderthals were making fire in Britain about 400,000 years ago,” said Prof Chris Stringer, of the Natural History Museum and part of the team behind the findings. “Of course, our species was evolving in Africa, while these people were living in Britain and Europe. We guess that our species, too, would have had this knowledge, but we don’t actually have the evidence of it.”The far earlier timeframe for fire-making suggests it may have played a significant role in key evolutionary advances, such as the emergence of language and the ability to survive in a wide range of climates. The control of fire provided warmth, light, protection from predators, andallowed humans to process a wider range of foods, supporting better survival, larger groups and freeing up energy to fuel brain development.“All these things were combined to enable humans to be more adaptable, to be able to spread into harsher, colder environments and to start occupying northern latitudes more successfully – places like Britain,” said Davis.“Fire becomes a hub for social interactions, for food sharing, for the development of language, for early storytelling, myth-making,” he added.The investigation focused on a disused clay pit, where stone tools had first been discovered in the early 1900s and which scientists returned to most recently in 2013 as part of the Pathways to Ancient Britain project.View image in fullscreenA heat-shattered handaxe found adjacent to the 400,000-year-old campfire at Barnham in Suffolk.Photograph: Jordan Mansfield, Pathways to Ancient Britain Project.“It’s taken many, many years to get to the point where we are today,” said Prof Nick Ashton, the curator of Palaeolithic collections at the British Museum, who co-led the research. “The first inklings of fire first emerged around about 2014.”It was not clear, though, whether this was opportunistic use of wild fire, or a human-made campfire. A turning point was the discovery of two fragments of iron pyrite, a naturally occurring mineral that creates sparks when struck against flint.Pyrite’s extreme rarity in the local area – it was not present in a database of 33,000 samples from Barnham – strongly suggested it had been sourced from chalky coastal outcrops tens of kilometres away and brought to the area for use as a fire striker. “It’s incredible that some of the oldest groups of Neanderthals had the knowledge of the properties of flint, pyrite and tinder at such an early date,” said Ashton.Geochemical tests also showed that a patch of reddened clay had been heated to temperatures of over 700C (1,292F) with repeated fire-use in the same location of the site. Together, this strongly suggested that a campfire, or hearth, that had been used by people on several occasions, according to the paperpublished in Nature.Ségolène Vandevelde, an archaeologist at the University of Québec in Chicoutimi, who was not involved in the research, said the findings were convincing.“The discovery of pyrite associated with these traces of fire is the icing on the cake, providing the earliest-known instance of fire making by humans,” she said.“If the ability to light fires is so ancient, we can assume that the mastery of fire and its habitual use may date back even further. These results encourage a closer search for traces of fire on ancient sites, even where they may be difficult to perceive due to alteration processes.”Explore more on these topicsAnthropologyEvolutionBiologynewsShareReuse this content"

But the nine-to-three vote to lower rates to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%was divisive among the committee that tends to vote in unanimity.The split highlights the overalluncertainty within the Fedas the US economy absorbs major economic shakeups, including tariffs, changes to the labor force from Trump’s immigration crackdown and massive government cuts.Making matters harder for Fed officials is the lack of comprehensive price and labor market data, the collection of which was halted during the government shutdown. And Trump is weighing his choice for replacing the Fed’s chair.The latest economic data has shown slight increases to both inflation, which went from 2.3% in April to 3% in September, and unemployment, which went from 4% in January to 4.4% in September.The dual increases, while relatively small, put the Fed in a tough spot. Keeping rates too high could stall the economy, but bringing rates down too quickly could mean higher inflation.New projections from officials suggest hesitance to cut rates further next year, a refusal that could further rifts between the Fed and the White House. In a press conference on Wednesday, Powell said the Fed was trying to balance “significant downside risks” in the jobs market with inflationary pressures from Trump’s tariffs that are “pretty clear to see”.Powell repeatedly said official figures were likely currently overestimating the strength of job creation in the US. He said officials will “need to be careful” in assessing economic data that will be released over the coming weeks on prices and the labor market due to the impact of the government shutdown on data collection.“Data was not collected in October and half of November, so we are going to get data, but we are going to have to look at it carefully and with a somewhat skeptical eye,” he said.Earlier in the year, Fed officials said they were waiting to see how Donald Trump’s tariffs would impact prices before making any changes to interest rates, pausing a rate cutting campaign that had started last fall.For months, Trump and his allies in the White House have publicly attacked Fed officials – typically, US presidents respect the nonpartisan nature of the central bank – for not lowering interest rates. Even with rising inflation, Trump has continued toinsistthat any price increases are holdovers from Joe Biden’s presidency, despite some corporate leaders saying that their price increases are directly attributed to tariffs.Next year, Powell’s term as chair will be up in May, leaving room for Trump to nominate his pick for the most influential economic role in the country. Trump has suggested Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, could be his nominee, though it is unclear how popular Hassett is among other Republicans.Hassett told Fox News on Wednesday that Trump will befinalizing his choice within the next few weeks.Asked about his legacy, Powell said: “My legacy? My thought is that I really want to turn this job over to whoever replaces me with the economy in really good shape.”Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveUS economyJerome PowellDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is therefore the conclusion of RÚV to notify the EBU today that RÚV will not take part in Eurovision next year.”10:21Eurovision in crisis? Israel’s inclusion causes rift | The LatestRÚV added that it had raised concerns numerous times with the EBU, which it felt had not been addressed.The war in Gaza has caused ructions at Eurovision, spurring protests outside venues and forcing organisers to clamp down on political flag-waving.The EBU held a general assembly last week, where members met to discuss concerns about Israel’s participation. Members voted to adopt tougher contest voting rules in response to allegations that Israel manipulated the vote in favour of their contestants, but took no action to exclude any broadcaster from the competition.The walkouts cast a cloud over the future of what’s meant to be a feelgood cultural party, dealing a blow to fans, broadcasters and the contest’s finances.Before the board meeting, RÚV’s vice-chair, Diljá Ámundadóttir Zöega, gave a hint of things to come. “Today is International Human Rights Day and I think the outcome will be in that spirit,“ she said.Earlier on Wednesday, Poland confirmed it would be participating in the contest. Its national broadcaster said: “We are aware of the scale of tension surrounding the upcoming edition. We understand the emotions and concerns. However, we believe that Eurovision still has a chance to once again become a space filled with music. And only music. We, like the overwhelming majority of EBU members, offer this opportunity.”Germany and Austria have also confirmed they will be taking part, arguing that Eurovision was conceived as an apolitical song contest to unite Europe.RTÉ, the Irish broadcaster, said participation was “unconscionable given the appalling loss of lives in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis there” while RTVE in Spain said participating would engender “distrust” in the organisation given the depth of feeling over Gaza.Spain’s culture minister, Ernest Urtasun, backed the boycott. He said: “You can’t whitewash Israel given the genocide in Gaza. Culture should be on the side of peace and justice.”Explore more on these topicsEurovisionIcelandIrelandSloveniaNetherlandsIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

It did not say how many roles could be affected.Vincent, who founded Leon in 2004 with Henry Dimbleby, who later became a government food tsar, and chef Allegra McEvedy, bought the business back in October, four years after he sold it to the billionaire Issa brothers’ EG Group petrol forecourts business in a £100m deal.The chain has now hired advisers from Quantuma after applying for an administration order, and aims to put the business into administration as soon as possible, a process which will help it to manage debt payments as it attempts to secure its long-term future.Since Vincent’s buyout, 10 outlets have already closed, including three overseas franchises, and the entrepreneur has announced plans to ditch Leon’s £25-a-month Roast Rewards scheme from January. Subscribers could claim up to five coffees a day and discounts on food.He has also signed up staff to training in wing tsun, a martial art, to improve coffee-making times “while lowering heart rates”.Asda, which the Issa brothers also invested in,bought Leonalong with most of EG’s UK arm in 2023, but it has struggled under theailing supermarket.The fast food chain’s sales fell almost 4% to £62.5m in 2024 when it made a pre-tax loss of £8.38m, according to the latest accounts filed at Companies House.Vincent said that, after a review, he had concluded that the company needed to downsize as the shift to working from home had reduced demand for takeaways.He said: “If you look at the performance of Leon’s peers, you will see that everyone is facing challenges – companies are reporting significant losses due to working patterns and increasingly unsustainable taxes.“Today for every pound we receive from the customer, around 36p goes to the government in tax, and about 2p ends up in the hands of the company. It’s why most players are reporting big losses.”Vincent added that the “immediate priority” was to close the most unprofitable restaurants. The group has either found other brands to take on leases, or will be asking landlords to release the business from its commitments.“We will rebuild Leon on its core values and I hope to be providing jobs to many more people once we have returned to profitability and can continue to grow again,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They met at the management consultancy Bain & Company, where they bonded over a “dislike of premade sandwiches served from neon-lit chiller cabinets”, the company has said.Explore more on these topicsRetail industryFast foodAsdaFoodJob lossesHospitality industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The fund will invest in companies in the UK working in robotics, longevity, gaming, space, defence and AI, the FT reported.Hiro was co-founded by Ian Livingstone, the co-founder of Games Workshop and the Lara Croft-maker Eidos. The venture capitalist firm aims to announce its first investment from the fund in the first half of next year.“Having an understanding of how government and regulators work is relevant to helping our portfolio flourish and building global leading companies from Europe,” said the Hiro co-founder Luke Alvarez, commenting on Clegg’s hiring.Yann LeCun, who recently announced he was to leave his post as chief scientist ofMetaAI at the end of the year, is also joining Hiro as an adviser to assess investments in AI companies.“We are entering a new phase of AI – an era of systems which can understand the physical world, have persistent memory and which can reason and plan complex actions,” said LeCun. “Hiro … is exceptionally well placed to capitalise on this new wave of opportunity in Europe.”As Liberal Democrats leader, Clegg managed to get his party into power through a coalition with David Cameron’s Conservatives in 2010.Clegg resigned as leader five years later after taking the blame for Lib Dems 2015 election defeat, which he described as“immeasurably more crushing and unkind”than he had feared.Helost his seat in the 2017 general electionand subsequently said he “never had any desire to sit in an unreformed House of Lords”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The shares rose almost 9% after news of the potential sale or breakup.One industry source said they did not believe there was much appetite for Evoke’s assets and speculated that bondholders might take control of the company and strip its assets, such asWilliam Hillhigh street shops, to recoup some of their money.Evoke, which is headquartered in Gibraltar, has net debt of £1.82bn.Last month, after the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, announced significant increases in the duty levied on online sports betting and casino games, Evoke said it expected to pay extra tax of up to £135m a year.It withdrew its medium-term financial targets at the time and said the decision would “drive customers to the black market, reduce overall tax generation, lead to thousands of job losses, and decrease investment in UK sports”.On Wednesday, Evoke told investors it had “decided to undertake a review of the company’s strategic options, which will include the consideration of a range of potential alternatives to maximise shareholder value, including, but not limited to a potential sale of the group, or some of the company’s assets and/or business units”.Reeves increased duty on online gaming from 21% to 40%, while duty on online sports betting was increased from 15% to 25%, with an exception for horse racing.Evoke, founded in the late 1990s by a group of Israeli web tech specialists, said it would be hit hard by tax rises in the budget.Its troubles have not been limited to external pressures, however, with a series of high profile compliance problems that have weighed heavily on the business.In 2023, itremoved its chief executive and suspended VIP customer accountsin the Middle East amid an internal investigation into a failure to follow anti-money laundering processes.The company said certain “best practices have not been followed” in relation to “know your client” and anti-money-laundering regulations, sending its shares down by more than a quarter on the day.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Both men have since been charged with conspiracy to bribe and conspiracy to defraud.Explore more on these topicsWilliam HillGamblingBudgetnewsShareReuse this content"

This year OpenAI, Perplexity, Google and Microsoft all launched AI features that allow users to search for products through their chatbots, with agents that can complete orders on behalf of consumers.Tui said it was using AI to help create “inspirational videos, content and translations to improve trip planning”, as well as AI-powered voice and chat agents for customer services.It is the latest effort by the German travel operator to incorporate AI technology into its customer experience, after it started using ChatGPT in its app to provide holiday recommendations in 2023. Its first launch had some hiccups, with the Guardian finding at the time that the botstruggled with basic conversation.Tui reported annual pre-tax profits up 20% to just over €1bn (£904m), close to a record high. Revenue rose 4% to €24.2bn but is expected to grow at a slower rate next year, between 2% and 4%, reflecting “prevailing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties”, Tui said.The company, which has been struggling in its core German market, also laid out plans to cut costs by €250m by 2028, though Ebel insisted “there is a big difference in having less jobs versus cutting jobs”.He said: “Our workforce is changing and we are getting more efficient. We will not get less people in total. We want to grow and we want to be more efficient.”The company, which has its headquarters in Hanover, employs about 67,000 people around the world. Its shares fell by 2.8% in early trading on Tuesday and are down by about 34% over the past five years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sign up hereJason OkundayeWed 10 Dec 2025 09.46 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 09.48 ESTShareAfter more than 50 editions surfing across the waves of the global Black diaspora with Nesrine, this will be my final dispatch for the Long Wave, as I move on to a new role on the Opinion desk at the Guardian. I am heartbroken to be leaving, but I am so thankful to all of our readers for being so encouraging and engaged throughout the past year.Any who, time to cut the sad music (this is myfarewell tune of choice), as I have one more edition for you. In late autumn, I took my first trip to Ghana for Accra Cultural Week. While there, I visited the historic area of Jamestown, which was reflected in an exhibition by artist Serge Attukwei Clottey.Inside Accra Cultural WeekView image in fullscreenSpiritual experience … opening night of Serge Attukwei Clottey’s exhibition at Gallery 1957.Photograph: Nii Odzenma/Gallery 1957Visiting the exhibitions, installations and performances of Accra Cultural Week, I saw how the finest art nourishes and constructs a country’s history and identity. The centrepiece was no doubt Serge Attukwei Clottey’s exquisite [Dis]Appearing Rituals: An Open Lab of Now for Tomorrow, which put his pioneeringafrogallonismon full display: a concept that transforms yellow jerrycans into illusory art pieces, mosaics of yellow, brass and gold. The show was conceived in tribute to the resilience of Jamestown, an historic area of Accra, which I take a walking tour of with designer, historian and exhibition co-curator Allotey Bruce-Konuah.Here I learn that the area – predominantly inhabited by the Ga people, a fishing community – is also where many formerly enslaved people returned from Brazil and settled in the 1830s. The community, known as the Tabom people, brought Portuguese language and culture. Throughout Jamestown, you can see a mix of architecture. There’s Franklin House, or Fort Vicentia, with its distinct European-style brickwork and arched doorways – it was built in 1660 by the Portuguese to facilitate their trade with the then named Gold Coast, as well as to then auction enslaved people. And there is also theJamestown Lighthouse, built by the British in 1871 (though its red-and-white-striped facade is the result of a 1930s revamp).View image in fullscreenSubsistence v triumphant exit … fishing boats in Jamestown and a funeral poster.Composite: AlamyAlso striking about Jamestown, is the presence of funeral posters. Everywhere you turn, whether plastered over alleyways or on larger billboards, you’ll see funeral details and the general tone of mourning (“painful exit” v “triumphant exit”). In Jamestown, as throughoutGhana, funerals are large-scale community celebrations and social events. Indeed, as my walking tour passes one on the street, we are invited to watch as a band plays music for us.In Clottey’s spectacular exhibition, all of the sights, sounds and religious textures of Jamestown are present – particularly in the Jamestown nshonaa installation, which captures its beach. In this, you’re soothed by the sound of crashing waves and the sand at your feet, while beach huts and hanging fishing nets and the vision of boats honour its spirited, multigenerational fishing community. Yet standing in this exhibition space, I couldn’t help but think of the mountains ofdiscarded clothing, plainly visible whenever you walked near water, that threatened the beauty and serenity of this area. Clottey’s work makes such incredible use of recycled materials that it conjures a spiritual and atmospheric quality, profoundly meditating on consumption and the cycles of life. And so, even with this troubling knowledge of fast-fashion dumping, I’m left with a vision of Accra that feels like a manifesto for environmental protection and the preservation of culture.View image in fullscreenVisual cues … Denyse Gawu-Mensah with her work at Gallery 1957.Photograph: Nii Odzenma/Gallery 1957There is much more to Accra Cultural Week, too. Within an unfinished structure at the University of Ghana, and as part of a collaboration between Gallery 1957 and the Limbo Museum, the artist Reginald Sylvester II presented On the Other Side of Languish, an incredibly moving, minimalist exhibition that displayed sculptures and paintings created with welders from the city of Tema, as well as making use of found materials and objects.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Between Accra Cultural Week andArt X Lagos, what you’ll find are art scenes that are not simply nascent or “upcoming” but have built up an entire world that is here to stay.This trip was provided by Gallery 1957.To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsGhanaThe Long WaveColonialismWasteArtAfricaPaintingExhibitionsnewslettersShareReuse this content"

Our countdown of the very best kicks off hereMore on the best culture of 2025Wed 10 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 05.01 ESTShare50-4150The Last of Us(Sky Atlantic/Now) TV’s best ever video game adaptation screamed back to life with the year’s most traumatic killing off of a beloved character. Losing one half of the show’s central duo was no easy thing to move past, but The Last of Us morphed into a touching meditation on grief, loss and the pain of love left unspoken – with added mushroom monsters.What we said:“A gutsy and thoughtful rendering of humans on the edge.”Read more49All Her FaultView image in fullscreenNo one is more watchable … Sarah Snook and Dakota Fanning in All Her Fault.Photograph: Peacock/AP(Sky Atlantic/Now) Is anyone as watchable as Sarah Snook? Her performance as Marissa, whose son Milo was kidnapped when she thought he was on a play date, was an absolute powerhouse as we’ve come to expect from the Succession star. It started with the most profound fear a parent can face, before it turned out to be even worse: orchestrated from within her own inner circle. But the plight of Dakota Fanning as her friend Jenny, trying to navigate the incessant hell and guilt of being a working mother, was relatable and affecting too. Together, they deepened this thriller into something far more intriguing.What we said:“All Her Fault is fantastically well done. All the carefully planted seeds come to fruition. All the narrative cogs turn and interlock fast and seamlessly. You come for the terrifying premise and stay for the absolute pleasure.”Read more48The Last Musician of Auschwitz(BBC Two/iPlayer) This exceptional film told the extraordinary story of the now 100-year-old cellist Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, the only surviving member of the women’s orchestra at Auschwitz. First-hand testimonies – including from the stoic, straight-talking subject herself – plus archive footage and musical performances merged to show the emotional turmoil of prisoners playing beautiful music in a hellscape, as well as tiny glimmers of resistance.What we said:“This incredibly impressive programme does not let us forget about Auschwitz’s corpse mountains or stench of burning bodies for a second, all the while posing questions about art and humanity that should ring in your ears for years to come.”Read more47Apple Cider VinegarView image in fullscreenA tissue of lies … Kaitlyn Dever as Belle Gibson in Apple Cider Vinegar.Photograph: Ben King/AP(Netflix) A remarkable true story, superbly told; this series dramatised the rise and fall of Belle Gibson, an Australian woman who established herself as a “wellness guru” by falsely claiming to have mitigated cancer via dietary tricks and alternative medicine. The truth was simpler: Gibson didn’t have cancer and her career and persona was a tissue of lies. Kaitlyn Dever’s portrayal of Gibson was admirably nuanced; she’s deeply dishonest but also desperately needy and in denial about the consequences of her actions, not least for her followers, some of whom relied upon her hokum to combat life-threatening conditions.What we said:“A fast, drily witty, acutely intelligent, compassionate and furious commentary on greed, need, mass delusion, self-deception, the exploitation of the credulous and the enabling of insidious new forms of all of these by technology.”Read more46The ResidenceView image in fullscreenCharmingly good fun … The Residence.Photograph: Erin Simkin/Netflix(Netflix) Something terrible has happened at the White House! No, not Donald Trump’s new ballroom extension but a fictional murder at the heart of American power. This funny, quirky whodunnit starred Uzo Aduba as Cordelia Cupp, an eccentric detective (she’s a keen birder, dresses entirely in brown tweed and frequently utilises her binoculars for work purposes) sent to solve the case. It’s charmingly good fun – essentially a country house murder mystery with added snark and West Wing trappings.What we said: “A gorgeous, gleeful romp.”Read more45Common Side EffectsView image in fullscreenAn absolute triumph … Common Side Effects.Illustration: Adult Swim(Adult Swim/Channel 4) Has Mike Judge ever made a bad show? This is the question it was hard not to ponder while watching this impeccable animated thriller-comedy. The plot? A fungi expert discovers a mysterious mushroom that seems to cure all illness, and ill-advisedly tells his childhood crush Frances – who now works for big pharma. The resulting high-octane deep-state drama was a blackly humorous adventure with real heart that satirised the state of healthcare in a capitalist society. An absolute triumph of TV-making.What we said:“Not merely the best thing I’ve seen on TV this year but one of the best shows I’ve seen in my life.”Read more44Gaza: Doctors Under Attack(Channel 4) The film the BBC couldn’t broadcast. Thanks be, then, to Channel 4 for stepping into the breach and airing it – for this was an essential document of our times. Its unsparing look at the targeting of Palestinian medics showed a pattern that has emerged over the past two years at hospitals across Gaza. First, they are bombed. Then, they are raided and doctors detained and tortured. Then, when their workplaces are reduced to rubble, the cycle starts on the next hospital. The testimony by Dr Khaled Hamouda, whose home was bombed, killing most of his family … before a drone strike mere moments later hit the supposed safe house his remaining children had escaped to, was an unforgettable piece of television that really needed to be aired.What we said:“In an open letter before its broadcast, Channel 4’s Louisa Compton warned that Doctors Under Attack would ‘make people angry, whichever side they take’. She is right. This is the sort of television that will never leave you.”Read more43Am I Being Unreasonable?View image in fullscreenDangerously addictive … Daisy May Cooper as Nic in Am I Being Unreasonable?Photograph: Simon Ridgway/BBC/Boffola Pictures(BBC One/iPlayer) This riot of marital, sexual and social awkwardness (with a side order of murder and betrayal) came courtesy of Daisy May Cooper and Selin Hizli, who have created a worthy successor to Julia Davis’s scabrous 2004 sitcom Nighty Night. Cooper stars as Nic, a woman juggling guilt, trauma and parenting catastrophe, still finding time for extramarital hi-jinks and yetsomehowremaining deserving of sympathy, mainly because of the cavalcade of monsters around her. A dangerously addictive chamber of horrors.What we said:“Howlingly funny.”Read more42Task(Sky Atlantic/Now) This crime drama starring Mark Ruffalo as gone-to-seed cop Tom Brandis allocated a dangerous new assignment in Philadelphia certainly wasn’t for the faint-hearted. But if you could handle the all-pervasive air of impending catastrophe, it was a fine, gritty, twisty procedural centred on stick-up merchants, biker gangs and the grim ramifications of the fentanyl trade. An intense downer, in the best possible way.What we said:“A meditation on guilt, sin and the possibility of redemption.”Read more41The TraitorsView image in fullscreenThe worst traitor ever to roam the castle … Linda, with fellow traitor Minah and faithful Fozia.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio Lambert(BBC One/iPlayer) Before the celebrity version gave us Alan Carr, the third series of normies Traitors delivered Linda, AKA the worst/best traitor to ever roam the castle. Her head-turn when Claudia Winkleman said “traitors” wasn’t the only golden moment. Charlotte’s fake Welsh accent! Lisa the vicar’s bare-faced lie about her job! The shock return of Alexander! Rare is the show that makes appointment TV and creates national watercooler chat in 2025. But beyond all that – Claudia’s gothic outfits alone were worth tuning in for.What we said:“As a study of human behaviour – of deception, manipulation, self-preservation – it remains captivating. As perhaps the best example of social experiment-style reality TV, it has cemented its place in the cultural firmament.”Read more40-31 coming soonStay tuned for the next episode"

The director describes capturing their boats getting rammed by the Chinese coast guardWed 10 Dec 2025 09.47 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 11.41 ESTShareDuring a televised debate in 2016, populist presidential candidate Rodrigo Duterte made a typically belligerent statement that he himself would jetski to Scarborough Shoal in the SouthChinaSea and plant a Philippine flag there. Duterte claimed that he was ready to die a hero to keep the Chinese out of the bitterly contested maritime territory.“That made millions of Filipino workers and fishers vote for him because of that one promise,” says film-maker Baby Ruth Villarama. As her new Oscar and Bafta-contending documentaryFood Delivery: Fresh from the West Philippine Seareveals, it wasn’t a promise Duterte kept. “He would make excuses that the jetski has broken down. Eventually there was an official pronouncement that it had just been a campaign joke. From then on, the fisherfolk were really enraged.”In her film, Villarama follows the fishers as they traverse what they call the West Philippine Sea, which thePhilippinesregards as part of its exclusive economic zone. She spent 60 days filming them, as well as recording the work of the soldiers who supply local islands with food. It’s a tough and dangerous existence that has been made even more difficult by continuous harassment from the Chinese coast guard.Food Delivery has beautiful underwater photography and footage of bird colonies as Villarama patiently chronicles the everyday problems faced by the fishers and soldiers. They’re away from their families for long stretches; they have bills to pay; and when he is back on shore one of the main protagonists is shown undergoing tests for prostate cancer. It is in many ways an observational, human interest documentary about life at sea. Nonetheless, since completing the project in March, Villarama has found herself caught in the crosshairs of the Chinese government.View image in fullscreen‘Working in quiet dignity’ … Food Delivery: Fresh from the West Philippine Sea.Photograph: Voyage StudiosFood Delivery was suddenly pulled from the programme of the Philippines’ CinePanalo film festival two days before its world premiere. The reason became apparent when it was subsequently selected for the Doc Edge festival in New Zealand, whose organisers received a formal request from the Chinese Consulate-General in Auckland not to screen the movie. The Consulate-General’s letter,published by the festival,saidthe film was “rife with disinformation and false propaganda, serving as a political tool for the Philippines to pursue illegitimate claims in the South China Sea.”Villarama says the harassment of the fishers “cannot go on”. “The bullying, and boats being chased every week. If we are to live in a stable society, we have to respect certain boundaries. This 200-mile exclusive economic zone is a gift to every country. The UK has it, the US has it, the Philippines has it.”Food Delivery: Fresh from the West Philippine Sea review – gripping trip along supply lines in China standoffRead moreA certain strained civility still exists between the Chinese and the Philippines coast guards. This is a campaign of harassment that can include ramming and the cutting of ropes but both sides try to steer clear of outright physical violence. Villarama and her camera crew were themselves on board a ship that got rammed by the Chinese coast guard. She expresses her relief that the ship didn’t sink: “I am not a good swimmer. I can float – but I am not a good swimmer.”Villarama previously worked as a stringer for Reuters and as a TV journalist and her 2016 documentary Sunday Beauty Queen explored the plight of Philippine foreign workers looking for escape from their lives of underpaid drudgery by taking part in beauty pageants.Now, though, the stakes are high. It’s not just about the livelihoods of those working in the fishing industry – national food security is at risk. “I did not ask for this personally. Who would want to make a film that would go against a superpower like China? But where I was presented with the truth, the lived experience of our fisherfolk, the very people who are working in quiet dignity, and when I realised there are actual threats to our freedom and our food security, we had no choice but to embrace the story.”Explore more on these topicsFilmPhilippinesChinaDocumentary filmsAsia PacificFishing industrynewsShareReuse this content"

It really cannot be overstated how much of a rehash this boyband contest isStuart HeritageWed 10 Dec 2025 03.01 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 12.54 ESTShareLadies and gentlemen, the most cynical bait and switch of the year has finally arrived. To the casual viewer, Netflix’s new series Simon Cowell: The Next Act may appear to be yet another quasi-unvarnished authorised documentary series.And that would make sense, because those things are everywhere at the moment. Everyone fromDavid BeckhamtoRobbie WilliamstoCharlie Sheenhas made one, allowing a film crew into their lives to offer just enough grit to fool people into thinking they are watching anything other than a heavily sanitised publicity project. And, really, who deserves one of these more than Simon Cowell?Because here is a man who, as the face of The X Factor and Pop Idol, spent the first part of the 21st century at the top of the entertainment tree. He could make and break careers with a flick of his wrist. Discounting sport, royalty, Covid and (weirdly) Gavin & Stacey, the 2010 X Factor finale remains the most watched British TV show of the last 15 years. In his prime, Cowell was wealthy. He was powerful. He was everywhere.But then he disappeared. Much hyped projects – such as the “bigger than Disney” entertainment megabrand with Philip Green and the series of children’s books he announced five years ago – came to nothing. He broke his back. His appearance changed. There were whispers that he had become a devotee to a wealth of wacky-sounding health fads. Had he settled into semi-retirement? Was he a full-blown Howard Hughes-style hermit, growing out his fingernails? The world needed to know: what exactly does Cowell do with his life when there isn’t any X Factor to fill it?View image in fullscreenWill it make him famous again … Simon Cowell and Poo Bear in Simon Cowell: The Next Act.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixNow we know, for here comes the bait and switch. Even though it might be presented as a slice-of-life reality documentary, Simon Cowell: The Next Act is – wait for it – The X Factor. It’s literally just another bloody X Factor.No, really. One minute Cowell is semi-candidly bickering with his partner, Lauren Silverman, the next he’s junked that entire facade to find a new boyband. He holds auditions. He takes them to bootcamp. He uses pictures of their faces to decide who he wants to send home. There are unbelievably weak sob stories (one contestant, and please ready the hankies for this, works at a Nando’s). Short of Louis Walsh stumbling in to absent-mindedly take everything to deadlock, this is The X Factor. I cannot overstate this enough. It’s Cowell’s one idea, for the billionth time, in slightly different clothes.But, of course, Cowell wants to make a new boyband. His biggest success was creating One Direction, and he is openly envious of the rise of K-pop here, with their ultra-manufactured groups and rigidly controlled management. Which, admittedly, isn’t a particularly great thing to be envious of. The demands placed onK-pop acts are so great that abuse and suicide isn’t uncommon, as are “slave contracts” that forbid acts from gaining weight or falling in love.I’m prohibited from telling you how the series ends, but it might be best not to hold out much hope. Netflix’s last attempt at a singing competition – this summer’s Building the Band – was a dud. It was won by a group called 3Quency, whose first single failed to chart. And that show was specifically about a band, which is more than you can say about Simon Cowell: The Next Act. The star of this show is Cowell and Cowell alone. The group – all the identically haired 16-year-olds who did most of the work – are presented as an afterthought.The whole thing reminds me of Nathan Fielder’s brilliant comedy The Rehearsal, which did something similar this year. Fielder dragged a bunch of unknowing wannabes into a singing contest called Wings of Voice, only to reveal that it had been created specifically to help airline co-pilots be more confident during their inflight communication. That’s essentially what The Next Act is, although this time the secret goal is simply to make Cowell famous again. Those poor kids don’t stand a chance.Simon Cowell: The Next Act is on Netflix nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewSimon CowellreviewsShareReuse this content"

They discuss the man behind the headlines – and why they are continuing his mission to help others struggling with addictionWed 10 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 08.41 ESTShareWatch the third season of Friends, writes Matthew Perry in his memoir, and you can see how thin he had become by the end of it. “Opioids fuck with your appetite, plus they make you vomit constantly,” he writes. Look again, and yes – his fragile wrists emerge from a shirt that looks as if he has borrowed it from someone far larger, his trousers hang off him – and it’s unbearably sad now, with the knowledge that addiction would kill Perry nearly 30 years later, at the age of 54. At the time, most people watching probably wouldn’t have noticed, dazzled instead by Perry’s sharpness and immaculate comic timing as Chandler Bing, the show’s dry wit. He was having to take 55 Vicodin pills a day – an opioid - just to function and avoid terrible withdrawal symptoms, but he was never high while he was working, he writes inFriends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing, which came out in 2022. He just had to make it to the end of the season so he could get help. Had the series lasted for more than its 25 episodes, he thought it would have killed him.That was the first time Perry went into rehab. He was 26, and one of the biggest stars in the world. There would be more than 65 attempts to detox from drug and alcohol addiction over the next decades until his death in 2023. Last week, adoctor was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prisonfor supplying ketamine in the lead-up to Perry’s death (though not the ketamine that killed him); three others who have pleaded guilty will be sentenced in the coming months.View image in fullscreenThe Friends cast in 1994, from left: Jennifer Aniston, David Schwimmer, Courteney Cox, Matt LeBlanc, Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyPerry’s manager, Doug Chapin, and publicist Lisa Kasteler-Calio had been working with Perry for more than 30 years. After he died, they launched theMatthew PerryFoundation, to support addiction treatment and recovery, and campaign to reduce stigma. Perry had long talked about the idea of an organisation doing both. By October 2023, Kasteler-Calio, one of Hollywood’s powerhouse publicists, had already decided to step away from the agency she had co-founded. She texted Perry – he was a big texter, she says – to see when he was free so she could go over and tell him in person. He immediately called her. “I was going to continue to work with him on [the foundation] and a few other ideas that he wanted me to be involved in,” she says, when we speak over Zoom, joined by Chapin.That was three days before he died. “The tragedy on top of the tragedy of losing Matthew is that he was ready to do the work,” she says. Chapin says: “Here we were, stopped mid-sentence, so there was nothing except, well, I guess we have to complete this. That was the driving force.” Kasteler-Calio points out that Perry had always said he didn’t want to be remembered forFriends, but as someone who had helped others. “We didn’t have to search for the mission. We had it. He wanted to help as many people as he could, it’s that simple,” she says.View image in fullscreenPerry in the first series of Friends, 1994.Photograph: NBC/NBCUniversal/Getty ImagesChapin became Perry’s manager in 1992, and introduced Perry to Kasteler-Calio just before it became clear that Friends – which launched in 1994 – would become huge. He was “adorable”, remembers Kasteler-Calio. “I think the reason people fell in love with Chandler is because the real Matthew came through.” Chapin remembers Perry as a young man who didn’t really change over all the decades they knew each other, when he was “what he always was – lovely, smart, funny.”Chapin is clear that while Perry craved fame, his struggles pre-dated the pressures it brought (Perry had his first drink at 14). “The pressures and the demons are not unusual for people who are very talented. I don’t want to make a mass determination, but it’s a particular kind of person that looks to have everybody know them and to be famous.” But fame and attention, he says, “amplify the pressure to some degree. More importantly, it made it very hard to have his problems happen in private.”It also killed Perry’s fantasy that if only he could become famous, he would feel better about himself. “He found himself with the number one TV show and the number one movie [The Whole Nine Yards], and, boom, his other struggles still existed,” he says. That wasn’t specific to Perry, he adds. “What was specific to Matthew is crazy loyalty,” says Chapin, adding that that is vanishingly rare in Hollywood. “There’s a reason we worked with him for 30 years. He kept his group of friends close. He kept his representatives close. He inspired loyalty, but he also gave loyalty, that was just one of his characteristics.”I don’t want people to think Matthew was a victim of the disease, because he was engaged in trying to recover – alwaysNeither had any idea that Perry was struggling at the beginning. “He was working so much, he was doing the show and doing a movie in the breaks, there was such intensity of work that I think it masked some of it,” says Chapin. He adds that also, Perry’s addiction “was not as much of a challenge [then] as it became for him.” Kasteler-Calio says: “Matthew felt a deep sense of responsibility to the other five [on Friends]. He showed up every day and he did the work. He wasn’t somebody who was out in the clubs and all of that.” He was drinking at home, and taking drugs. “Because this disease is so isolating, he was not publicly, like a lot of others, displaying his disease.”By the seventh season in 2000 – he had signed the deal in hospital, while being treated for pancreatitis caused by excessive alcohol – Perry’s castmates were sufficiently worried to take him aside and tell him they knew he had a problem. Chapin and Kasteler-Calio say that Perry was always very open with them. “There was never the situation like, ‘Oh, we know something’s happening, but we can’t talk to him about it,’” says Chapin. “He’d be the person, when it got bad, who would say, ‘I need to stop and get help.’ I don’t want [people] to have the picture that Matthew was, for lack of a better word, a victim of the disease, because he was engaged in trying to recover, always.”View image in fullscreenPerry’s manager Doug Chapin and his publicist Lisa Kasteler-Calio at the Matthew Perry Foundation.Photograph: Eric Charbonneau/The Matthew Perry FoundationBut it must have been difficult at times for them to do their jobs, and keep Perry’s career going for him. And there were times, admits Chapin, “where the disease collided with the work. I think it’s better that those stories come from [Perry’s] book than from us.” Neither want to dwell on episodes where productions were postponed because Perry wasn’t well – the 2002 film Serving Sara, or some of his scenes in Friends – or the times he did show up, such as on the CBS show The Odd Couple, but was unreliable. If Perry’s addiction did make their jobs tricky at times – and it must have done – there was no question that the priority was always his health. Kasteler-Calio, still protective, points out that when Perry did have to remove himself from work, on his return to sets he would go around “and apologise to each and every single person”. Many big name actors would not have done that, she adds.Although it became the story, Perry’s addiction is far from the whole picture. There were also stretches of sobriety, one of which brought him an Emmy nomination for his role on Friends, and there was the play he wrote and opened in London, the dark comedy The End of Longing, the TV shows he wrote such as the ABC sitcom Mr Sunshine, which he also starred in. “I miss the creative side of him,” says Chapin. “He was very smart, creatively, and that’s very energising to be around.” Kasteler-Calio misses the way he made her laugh. “There are just many things, as life happened, that Matthew was a part of. I remember all of that, because that’s where his kindness and the compassion came through.”When he was struggling, she says, he didn’t hide it. “He wasn’t a difficult person. I’ve had plenty of difficult clients. I didn’t have a difficult day with him.” He was not, adds Chapin, “a temperamental guy. He was a lovely, sweet person who had a personal struggle and was always fighting to be the creative, engaged person he loved being, and trying not to succumb to this other thing, this disease.”View image in fullscreenPerry with his publicist Lisa Kasteler-Calio in 2008.Photograph: WENN Rights Ltd/AlamyFor Kasteler-Calio, the bigger challenges came from dealing with a media intent on getting stories about Perry – his struggles were excessively documented – not from the actor himself. In her five-decade PR career, the celebrity clients “that were the most challenging when they got into crisis are the ones that didn’t want to listen, that thought they had all the answers. That was not Matthew.”There were a couple of pivotal positive moments in Perry’s experience of addiction and attempts to get better. One was the therapist who told him it wasn’t his fault, that it was a disease. “Coming to the understanding that he was battling with a chronic illness changed his whole mindset around it,” says Chapin. The other was the publication of his2022 memoir– funny, self-deprecating and brutal. “He was always, throughout even his worst times, very helpful and engaged with other people,” says Chapin. “They would come to him because he had so much experience with the disease [and treatment] that he knew a million avenues to suggest.”View image in fullscreenPerry in 2008, the year the play he wrote and starred in opened in London.Photograph: David M Benett/Getty ImagesThe book was a way to reach people on a massive scale. “It was the big removing of the Band-Aid of shame, for him,” says Chapin. “It was a very important step for him. We come back to the stigma and he was always very conscious that the guilt and the shame around [addiction] was part of the struggle. The book was his way of going, ‘Here I am, everything about me, good, bad and ugly.’ Presenting that out into the world and getting all the love back that he got for it was transformational for him.”They had always told him how loved he was, says Kasteler-Calio, but Perry would shrug it off. Now, she says, with audiences coming to hear him speak or the people who wrote to him of their own struggles, “it was right in front of him. You couldn’t deny the impact, and it was Matthew having the impact, not Chandler. As hard as the struggle was for him, conversely, being able to help people was equal to that. That’s why, once we lost him, there was no question that we needed to create this foundation and do this work.”Tackling stigma is one of its fundamental missions. Only 50% of Americans, says Kasteler-Calio, “recognise that [addiction is] a disease. The rest feel like it’s a moral failing, and that you should just get over it, and that’s not right.” This includes some of the medical profession, she says. “Doctors are not trained in how to treat this disease.” It should be required training for all, not just for specialists, so that any doctor can recognise it, signpost people to the correct treatment – and be careful with their prescribing.We’re doing what Matthew wanted. He said it over and over: I want to help as many people as possiblePerry writes that had he not taken the painkiller one doctor gave him on a film set early in his career, after he had injured himself in a jetski accident, perhaps “none of the next three decades would have gone the way they did”. Coming out of a two-week coma in 2018 – the result of a burst colon, followed by pneumonia, caused by the stresses his body had been through – he was put back on opioids. The foundation works with Dr Sarah Wakeman, an expert in addiction medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, and they have established a fellowship in Perry’s name to help train doctors. “One of the things that is important when we’re talking about this is that recovery is possible, this is a treatable disease,” says Chapin. “The more skilled we get at treating it, the more we’re going to see examples of recovery.”A summit held by the foundation in September brought about 200 experts together, along with people and communities with experience of addiction, to build partnerships and share knowledge about everything from treatment to policy. A week later, the foundation was speaking at the Clinton Global Initiative, run by Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton, about the impact of stigma, and how to end it. At the less high-profile end, one of the first things the foundation did was to give money to about 20 grassroots organisations they had identified across California which were helping people with addiction and desperately needed funding. Kasteler-Calio smiles when she said she spent two days on Zoom calls, offering the money and trying to convince people it wasn’t a scam. “What people have to go through to apply for grants, it’s expensive, it takes a lot of time. We wanted them to have access to the money immediately,” she says.View image in fullscreenMatthew Perry’s 2022 autobiography, Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing.Photograph: Hamdi Bendali/AlamyThere are employment initiatives to support people in recovery with getting back into work, and the foundation supports Bridge, a project led by doctors that aims to provide joined-up treatment for people with addiction who are leaving prison. “Because of our experience with Matthew, [we know that] it’s a multi-pronged disease, and you’ve got to hit it from a whole bunch of different directions at once,” says Chapin. “There is a medical aspect, the psychological aspect. There is also a community aspect to it. People don’t heal from this alone in a room. What we experienced throughout the Matthew experience was that there are all these holes in the process of recovery.” For many trying to recover, “You can get six weeks of sobriety in a shelter, and then there’s nothing, you’re on the street. There needs to be a wholeness, because the process needs to be sustained for a really long time. What we are looking at is where are the holes that we can fill?”Perry, say both, is present in all of this. “The six months of crying, that happened already,” says Chapin. “The rest has been working on his project, so he’s still right here with us, every day.” As for his ongoing grief, this is, he says, “the treatment”. Kasteler-Calio smiles and says, “We’re doing what Matthew wanted. He said it over and over: I want to help as many people as possible. Of course, we wish we were doing this with him. I miss him like crazy, but the best thing that we can do is just keep doing this work.”Explore more on these topicsMatthew PerryFriendsUS televisionAlcoholismTelevisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

But his music is quite different: a slippery layer cake of samples, multitudinous keys and lo-fi pop production, with Brown singing of a world where “the ebb and flow isn’t ebbing right”, be it in love or civic life. There is still room for an instant-classic R&B ballad though, in Tossed Away.Ben Beaumont-Thomas49Rochelle Jordan – Through the WallEverything isjust soon the British Canadian producer’s sixth album: expensively plush deep house suggesting club lights low, gleaming mirrors, potent looks igniting across the dancefloor. As much as the cold beat and ballroom flow of Ladida or the slapping “body, body, body” incantations of On 2 Something suggest a steadfast commitment to abandon, Jordan maintains impeccable poise and control throughout, whether in diva mode on Words 2 Say, breaking hearts on Bite the Bait, standing up for her needs on Doing It Too (“I’m not too much / You just give too little”) or patiently waiting for a frustrated lover to see the light on Ladida. Commanding, wise and committed to atmospheric excellence, party hosts don’t come better.Laura Snapes48Jerskin Fendrix– Once Upon a Time … in ShropshireView image in fullscreenHarebrained prog cabaret … Jerskin Fendrix.Photograph: Tim GuttJerskin Fendrix’s high-profile scores for the last three Yorgos Lanthimos films can’t really help prime you for the Midlands composer’s eccentrically beautiful second album, which pairs pristine musical theatre with the harebrained prog cabaret of Faith No More and (particularly) the under-sung Morphine. At first, Once Upon a Time … casts the rural bliss of growing up in 00s Shropshire in a golden light, a haven of getting ratted on Baileys and listening to Kanye on a farm, then having a lovely hungover group breakfast in someone’s kitchen. But the unexpected deaths he has experienced in recent years intrude to spoil paradise, eliciting feverish, absurdist expressions of grief – Jerskin Fendrix Freestyle is a bravura wig-out – and fathomless devastation from his camp, craggy voice. It demands a full theatrical production.LS47Clipping– Dead Channel SkyClipping frontman Daveed Diggs is best known for being in the original cast of Hamilton, and for all that this album is filled with noisy industrial rap, you can easily imagine it being successfully adapted for the Broadway stage. Dead Channel Sky is set in a cyberpunk dystopia not dissimilar to the scorched-sun “real world” of the Matrix, humming with janky tech and populated with fascists and freaky hedonists. Producers William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes render it in acid squiggles and revving breakbeats, while Diggs delivers his mutoid poetry like a prophet jacked up on some amphetamine he’s synthesised in a backstreet lab.BBTTell us your favourite albums of 2025Read more46The Tubs – Cotton CrownIn different hands,the Tubs’ second album might be a crushing listen, and understandably so. In 2014, frontman Owen Williams’ mother, the songwriter and author Charlotte Greig,died by suicide. Grief, as these songs detail, made him a rubbish boyfriend. But Cotton Crown is often funny and ardent, and especially self-aware about how new love might feel like a life raft to a depressed mind ill-equipped to reciprocate: “Know it’s all in my brain / Caught in the middle of loving you and being insane,” Williams sings on Fair Enough. His striking voice, somewhere between Richard Thompson and Bob Mould, bolts through the band’s joyful jangle-pop. Clear students of the form, they’re virtuosos with zero patience for perfection, their riffs hurtling and plundering like seagulls going at a spilled catch as they vigorously rough you up with profundity.LS45Smerz – Big City LifeView image in fullscreenAn album of stilted beauty … Smerz.Photograph: Alva Le FebvreCatharina Stoltenberg and Henriette Motzfeldt feel like the pop girlies of the incredibly prolific and off-kilterCopenhagen Rhythmic Music Conservatory scene, making music that’s more outward-facing and arch than some of their insular and traditional (and equally great) classmates. Their second album lurches between throwing yourself at life – “you’re a girl in the city and you shouldn’t think twice”, they chant in deadpan harmony on Roll the Dice – and actually thinking twice quite a lot in existential spirals about purpose and desire. The dissonance between confidence and anxiety comes through in the album’s stilted beauty: one minute, their whorls of prepared piano carry you along like clouds amid perfectly turned pop-R&B and balladry; then they stab and stutter, like cracks in the pavement destined to trap your heels. In 2023, K-pop’s brightest hopes NewJeans hired them as co-writers: more pop bearing their imprint can only be a good thing.LS44Sabrina Carpenter – Man’s Best FriendReleased almost exactly a year after her superstar-minting breakthrough Short n’ Sweet, and using a palette of soft rock, 80s pop, light disco and yearning country melodies, Carpenter added rich colour to one of pop’s most distinctive self-portraits. Her blatant sexuality is offset by an ironising sense of camp and a deep streak of cynicism, as she wonders whether to wrap her little finger round a series of hot but useless men. But whether dialling her exes while hopped up on “go-go juice” or being toxic for the sport of it (“you think that I’m gonna fuck with your head / well, you’re absolutely right”), Carpenter knows she’s part of the problem. Her fake helplessness at her own worst impulses is just one part of a formidable screwball comedy arsenal – she’s a Rosalind Russell for the dating app era.BBT43Jennifer Walton – DaughtersView image in fullscreenBolt from the blue … Jennifer Walton.Photograph: Liam CosfordThis Sunderland producer’s previous work included one EP of power electronics, one of antic club tracks, collabs with Aya and 96 Back as Microplastics, gigging with Kero Kero Bonito and a smattering of other credits. So her staggering, fully formed songwriterly debut was a total bolt from the blue. A swarming orchestral epic with shades of Julia Holter and Phil Elverum, it addressed her grief for her late father in serenely surrealist images – hitting a deer with a car in the middle of the night – and the painfully mundane realism of sitting in hospital corridors together. The standout Miss America combined both to stunning effect, a numbed incantation of everything Walton had seen on the US trip where she learned of her father’s diagnosis, the familiar now remade horribly mythic.LS42Erika de Casier– LifetimeErika de Casier’s fourth album updates the Y2K R&B template that fought for body-to-body sensuality in the face of rising digital creep. The old-school dial tones that pierce Lifetime’s rapt, liquid atmosphere work both as Janet homage and ironic sigh at how good those forebears had it when emotional warfare could only be conducted via pager: “Took a screenshot so / I could look at your pretty face all the time now / Without a sign that I’m online,” de Casier sings on earworm Delusional, a low-slung anthem for contemporary dating anxiety. “Hit midnight / Not even a text to hold me warm,” she rues on The Chase. That’s one of the most inviting things about Lifetime: its seductively cool surfaces conceal de Casier frantically kicking her feet below the surface, just like the rest of us.LS41Danny Brown – StardustThe Detroit rapper’s first post-rehab record totally disprovedhis fearsthat sobriety makes artists boring. On Stardust, Brown is still hard-wired with cartoonish verve, coupled with a genuinely touching sense of gratitude: “Sleeping real good at night ’cos I’m proud of myself,” he raps on Book of Daniel. While you probably wouldn’t describe someone who ponders “going bonkers and knocking out your chompers” as a wise elder, his hunger for life, opportunity and unmediated sensation blares through in how evidently gagged he is to centre younger producers from the digicore and hyperpop undergrounds: his unruly kids 8485, Jane Remover, Underscores, Frost Children and more make Stardust trip with glitch, rave, squealing riffs and overdriven noise. The rare record that makes you want to riot and shed a smiling single tear emoji.LS40-3140YHWH Nailgun – 45 PoundsView image in fullscreenChews you up … YHWH Nailgun.Photograph: Steve GullickIn 21 minutes, the New York band’s debut chews you up and spits you out the other side in a tentacular whirr of rototoms, guitars that shriek and whine like neglected machinery, erratic tempos and frontman Zack Borzone’s choked-out vocals. The way the record lurches and reels brings to mind the classic horror film scene in which a human undergoes a violent, magnificent transformation into some sort of beast: much like Gilla Band’s Most Normal, 45 Pounds is a font of mutant rock pleasures.LS39Sudan Archives – The BPMThe title refers to the beats per minute of dance music, but for an album that is so totally alive, it surely also refers to a pounding heart. Sudan Archives (AKA Angeleno producer-singer-songwriter-violinist Brittney Parks) announces that “life’s a game and I got VR goggles” as she revels in the epicurean joys of sex, dancing, travel and music itself with an almost superhuman appetite: “The rest are cowards / They choose to eat and we devour.” It’s all done with breezy good humour but there’s something inspiring, even quietly political about this mindful rejection of the straight life. Her backings – full of pop-R&B and ethereal electro – also dart away from obvious mainstream paths.BBT38Ethel Cain – Willoughby Tucker, I’ll Always Love YouView image in fullscreenRomantic slowcore … Ethel Cain.Photograph: Dollie KyarnIt’s easy to see why US singer-songwriter Cain has become so adored. This album further sketches out the kind of storytelling universe that attracts footnote-writing fandoms: it’s a prequel to the events of her debut album Preacher’s Daughter, deepening the tale of Ethel and a cast of young peers as they fumble towards connection and understanding. Her moody, romantic slowcore is also perfect music for listening to on headphones as you walk around boring suburban streets wishing you could leave for bigger things. It’s also great for road trips: songs between five and 15 minutes that seem to make a long, slow blur of the pell-mell world outside.BBT37Olivia Dean – The Art of LovingThe British breakthrough of the year, as Dean – already doing decent business with her pleasant but rather neat debut Messy – reached a completely new level of songcraft. Bossa nova, folk and soul (classic and neo) are warmed together with beautiful production, evaporating any sense of pastiche to make a sound that’s both easy on the ear but distinctly Dean’s. Every song has a superb top line, Dean stretching them into loose jazzy shapes (Let Alone the One You Love, Lady Lady) or tightening them into brisk pop (Man I Need, Something Inbetween). But it’s the lyrics that make these songs so red-blooded: every stage of love, from the first flutter of flirtation to the adrenal shock of rejection, is made so true to life.BBT36Anna von Hausswolff – IconoclastsView image in fullscreenSense of awe … Anna von Hausswolff.Photograph: Philip SvenssonAnna von Hausswolff is no stranger to a monumental statement: her primary instrument is the pipe organ,a towering edifice of tin and arsenicthat offers her an ever-renewing sense of awe. But the Swedish composer’s sixth album goes bigger than ever, grappling with mortality, transcendence and evil in a series of stormy epics that also lash a little pop structure to her prow. “Oh, I’m breaking up with language / Oh, in search of something bigger than this,” she screams on Stardust, an exhilarating co-pilot on the path to absolution.LS35Bon Iver – Sable, FableIf, as Justin Vernon recently suggested, this is the last ever Bon Iver album, it’s a beautiful redemption arc: a loving send-up of his anxious, myopic sad-sack self blossoms into a radiant appreciation of possibility, sensuality, risk. Everything Is Peaceful Love has one of the year’s best refrains: “Damn if I’m not climbing up a tree right now!”, giddy with thrill and absolutely no idea of what to do when you get up there other than enjoy the view. And while there are gorgeously passionate songs here, it’s the ones about gracefully letting go of an unviable love that really underscore the admirable humility in Vernon’s bowing out.LS34Snocaps – SnocapsKatie Crutchfield’s full-throated transformation into country doyenne on her last couple of albums as Waxahatchee almost makes it easy to forget her indie-rock origins. Fourteen years since she and twin sister Allison wound down their teen band PS Eliot, the DIY stalwarts got back together – with a little help from MJ Lenderman and producer Brad Cook – and went back to brass tacks for their surprise album as Snocaps. What a treat it was: full of punchy indignation – “I could never just …coast!” they exclaim on Coast – crunchy ruminations and sing-songy contemplations of what it means to depend on and grow alongside one another. You’d follow them anywhere.LS33Amaarae – Black StarView image in fullscreenIrrepressible … Amaarae.Photograph: Salomé Gomis-TreziseWe all need an Amaarae in our lives: the person who, when you weakly protest that you’re a bit tired to go out, will soon have you holding a bottle of decanted rum in the back of an Uber, while alongside you she looks quizzically at a series of resealable plastic bags. “Ketamine, coke and molly,” she chants on Starkilla; “I spiked this drink so please open your mouth,” she tells her lover on Fineshyt. And this club-ready album from the irrepressible Ghanaian-American pop star ends up being a sensual body high, as she chases sex and glamour into the ends of the night.BBT32Perfume Genius – GloryWith typical grace and humour Mike Hadreas sends up his self-defeating tendencies on his seventh album, and wonders how old you have to be to escape those lifelong patterns: like the contradiction of struggling to face the world while also fantasising about violence and romanticising “all the poems I’ll get out” of it. It feels apt that Glory starts with the western twang of It’s a Mirror, suggesting a fixed, brawny masculine archetype – then breaks it down over the course of the record, a gothic, celestial voyage into the interior, and the latest addition to a uniquely beautiful American songbook.LS31Horsegirl – Phonetics On and OnView image in fullscreenFinely tuned … Horsegirl.Photograph: Ruby FayeSpindly rock à la the Velvets and the Raincoats is as spartan in its constituent parts as it is high on reward, and Chicago trio Horsegirl demonstrated the inexhaustible pleasures of this 60-year-old form on their second album. With production from Cate Le Bon, they wove magic from just a few thrumming guitar and bass notes and Nora Cheng’s nonchalant, near-spoken vocals, as well as a knack for melodic hooks as finely turned as intricate woodwork: the bittersweet, skipping chorus of Information Content is an all-timer.LS30-2130Oklou – Choke EnoughTrance, medieval polyphony and Y2K pop may seem like odd bedfellows, but French singer-producer Oklou cast them all in a dawn-like haze on her gorgeous debut album, flowing these distinct disciplines together until they swooped and soared like a flock of starlings. Choke Enough was no academic exercise, either, with standout pop moments including Take Me By the Hand with Bladee – a winsome conjuring of how Alice Deejay might sound in collaboration with a piping minstrel.LS29Jacob Alon – In LimerenceView image in fullscreenRustling with life … Jacob Alon performing at the ZYN Rolling Stone UK Awards, in London’s Roundhouse.Photograph: Sue Moore/Hogan Media/ShutterstockOne of the star-making moments of the year was at the Mercury prize, as Scottish singer-songwriter Jacob Alon reduced the arena audience to a hush with just a voice and an acoustic guitar (though there were delighted whoops when a call of “free Palestine” was folded into their rendition of Fairy in a Bottle). It hopefully brought a broader audience to their debut album In Limerence, which has shades of Adrianne Lenker, Jeff Buckley and even Paul McCartney’s cadences to its unguarded indie-folk. It would have been easy to make this music blandly beautiful, but Alon and producer Dan Carey keep it rustling with life, as they reach for a burbling synth, trumpet improvisation or dusty-sounding drum kit.BBT28KeiyaA – Hooke’s LawThe title of the Chicago producer’s second album references the law of physics that reflects how stretch is proportional to load, how a spring always bounces back when tested within its elastic limit. The whistlestop Hooke’s Law expands and contracts accordingly as KeiyaA’s trifles with loss and romantic disappointment find their embodiment in racing breakbeats and collagist chaos one minute, gorgeous, soul-weary stillness – as with the liquid Stupid Prizes – the next. Listening can feel like being pleasurably blitzed with sensation, with each repeat revealing new details: an invitation to submit to KeiyaA’s masterful grip.LS27Wet Leg – MoisturizerIn 2022 they released one of the 21st century’s biggest indie debuts, which scored a UK No 1 and Grammy and Brit awards. The pressure was there for the follow-up, but not only did it top the charts again and earn another couple of Grammy noms, it had even more swagger and heart. “You wanna fuck me, I know, most people do,” Rhian Teasdale shrugs on Mangetout, and she actively intimidates a lustful bloke on Catch These Fists – but much of the album is given over to her wonderment at falling in love. “I’ll be your Davina, I’m coming to get you … I’ll be your Shakira, whenever, wherever”, she sings: great new vows for millennial weddings.BBT26Wolf Alice – The ClearingView image in fullscreenSomething symphonic … Ellie Rowsell of Wolf Alice performing at Manchester Arena.Photograph: Andy Von Pip/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock“English bands are so hesitant to ever admit ambition, but I am ambitious with this record,” Wolf Alice’s drummerJoel Amey saidas The Clearing was announced – and sure enough, this was a huge step up and out for a band who were already one of British indie’s biggest. There’s something symphonic about the heft of it and not just because of the string sections, thanks to superb production by Greg Kurstin: the bass and toms are heavy yet warm, the piano pounding yet not overbearing. Ellie Rowsell sings about suitably big themes, too, from universe-bending love on Leaning Against the Wall (“it really, really made the room sing, the way you said my name”), invaluable friendship on Just Two Girls, and The Sofa’s uplifting manifesto for being wild and indolent instead of toeing the line.BBT25Wednesday – BleedsThe North Carolina band’s sixth album is littered with endings, some violent – the title of Carolina Murder Suicide tells you all you need to know – some devastatingly mundane, as Karly Hartzman examined the cracks that led to a long relationship’s end. Her unique gaze unites both, noticing the details and dynamics that other songwriters might write off as inconsequential: like the “mounted antlers in the kitchen on a crooked nail” at a wake in Wound Up Here (By Holdin On). Full of screaming noise and riffs that evoke knee-sliding through the mud, as well as moments of unexpected sweetness, Bleeds shows the fullest picture of her band yet.LS24Titanic – HagenView image in fullscreenUncontainable euphoria … Mabe Fratti and Hector Tosta of Titanic.Photograph: Janet ChauThere can be few faster-evolving ensembles than that of Mabe Fratti and Hector Tosta, who in just two albums have leapt from sparkling cabaret jazz to … whatever the uncontainable euphoria of Hagen is. It’s a record that vaults from blast beats to choral beauty, eerie splendour to nervy cacophonies, like nothing else you’ve heard. Despite these bold stylistic clashes, it hangs together beautifully, thanks also to Fratti’s spectacular voice, as capable of cirrus-like delicacy as parched sharpness.LS23Cate Le Bon – Michelangelo DyingWhere two of this year’s most prominent breakup albums were savage (Lily Allen) or spectacular (Rosalía), Welsh innovator Cate Le Bon’s hypnotically murky seventh album reflected the circular sadness of love faltering – the catch-22 of wanting to escape heartbreak while knowing that letting go means relinquishing something that was once profound. Michelangelo Dying contains some of her very best choruses and melodies, powerful enough to penetrate the album’s billowing haze of guitar, sax and synths, like a hand reaching out in the dark.LS22Little Simz – LotusView image in fullscreenWider reckoning … Little Simz performing at the Co-op Live arena in Manchester.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianSimz’s sixth album came amid a dispute with the Sault producer Inflo – she has sued him for allegedly failing to repay a loan – and a couple of tracks target him in all but name (“You talk about God when you have a God complex / I think you’re the one that needs saving”). But Simz seems to be having a wider reckoning: she revels in how far she’s come from once just having “a dream and a pushbike”, and reflects on self-preservation, creative frustration and – in a gorgeous, naturalistic back-and-forth with Wretch 32 – push-pull family dynamics.BBT21John Glacier – Like a RibbonFor all that you can link her to trip-hop and cloud rap, what British MC has ever really sounded like this? It would be easy to call Glacier monotone, but in truth her careful, even flow holds so much musicality: her deliberately limited melodic and rhythmic range means that the subtle distinctions in her vocals are fascinating, as she goes from bored to wry to boastful to poignant within one-degree turns on the emotional thermostat. The grainy, faintly corrupted beats are superb, but it’s that delivery, and her lyrics themselves – stoic and even amused as life blows her from place to place – which make this album an all-timer in UK rap.BBT20-11 coming soonCome back tomorrow for the next 10 albums in the countdown!

In fact, the advent of digital media marks the third information crisis humans have lived through: the first came after the invention of writing; the second followed the printing press.These were periods of great social conflict and upheaval, and they profoundly altered our social and political relationships as well as our understanding of the world around us. Writing ushered in the Axial Age, the period between the eighth and third centuries BC, when many of the world’s most influential religious figures and thinkers lived: Laozi, Buddha, Zoroaster, the Abrahamic prophets and the Greek philosophers. Gutenberg’s printing press helped bring about the Reformation. While it is too early to know where the internet era will take us, in her new book, which she describes as a “speculative historical project”, Alderman suggests that those earlier crises offer clues.She is already well known as the author ofThe Power, a feminist sci‑fi novel that won the 2017 Women’s prize for fiction, a games writer, and a science presenter for Radio 4. It is enjoyable to spend time with an author who reads widely, thinks deeply and possesses the intellectual confidence to take such a lofty, historical view of the messiness of our current political moment. Alderman gives us a lively introduction to work by theorists such as Walter Ong, who studied how literacy changes culture, and Elizabeth Eisenstein, who explored how the printing press transformed our relationship to the truth. Ong observed that oral cultures were more conservative and less exploratory than literate ones because learned people had to spend so much time memorising information. Writing made possible more complex, reflective thought.It’s all too easy to forget that the person you’re arguing with is real and has feelingsSimilarly, the internet is changing us in profound ways. It makes it easier to think as a group, it has vastly increased the amount of information we each encounter and altered who can publish and broadcast it. It leads to “disintermediation”, because people can do for themselves things they once relied on specialists for – book flights, research vaccines. It has undermined the print-era institutions that once acted as gatekeepers to the truth. Eventually, Alderman writes, we’ll develop new institutions that will help us manage the firehose of information we’re now exposed to. For the time being, she argues, we would do well to shore up some old ones: broadcasters such as the BBC and public libraries.Alderman has a keen eye for the many subtle ways that digital media is changing us psychologically, and she is wise to note the fact that these shifts are often double-edged. The anonymity and vastness of the internet mean more people are sharing their inner thoughts and feelings online, which in turn means more people are learning that the weird quirk they thought was totally unique to them – the pleasurable tingle of ASMR, say – is something they have in common with others. It has never been easier to understand that “there isn’t a kind of person who isn’t a person”, Alderman writes and yet, online, it’s all too easy to forget that the person you’re arguing with is real and has feelings.With each new technology things get faster, she observes: printing a book is faster than copying one by hand; posting something online is quicker than printing it. Internet culture is evolving at an astonishing pace, and Alderman doesn’t even go into the disruptions of AI. We can’t possibly know how all of this will unfold, but it’s hard not to feel swept up by the sense of hope that underlies her speculations about our collective future. “We made a wonderful, catastrophic thing with writing. With printing. With the internet … We are making our minds do something they never evolved to do,” she writes. “It’s hard, and painful, and often makes us angry and afraid. And yet … every time we end by seeing each other more clearly.”Don’t Burn Anyone at the Stake Today (And Other Lessons from History About Living Through an Information Crisis) by Naomi Alderman is published by Fig Tree (£16.99).

Frances is a rich and beautiful twentysomething who becomes a “reluctant celebrity in certain circles” after her film, “an experimental documentary about rural isolation and rightwing conspiracy theories” in the modern-day United States, premieres to critical acclaim at a gallery in New York. Avery, meanwhile, is struggling to write what she describes as “a book of cultural reports”.Frances’s success isn’t easy for Avery. The two women met as undergraduates, but Avery hasn’t got family money. She maxes out her credit card and does occasional escort work to meet tuition payments. What makes her most resentful, though, is that Frances has dropped out of grad school to get married. Back in New York, panicked about her prospects, Avery goes out with a string of men – none significant enough to be referred to by their actual names – and ends up taking a job at a rightwing dating app called Patriarchy.While this is Levy’s first book, she has made a name for herself – in certain circles – as a founding editor of Forever Magazine, a trendy publication for alternative literature and arts. “A big thing,” Levy has said when describing its editorial preferences, “is style over plot. We really care about language.” This approach is reflected in Flat Earth – and some passages from the book are edited versions of stories that Levy wrote for the magazine. The prose is, for the most part, simple and precise, punctuated with bursts of imagery (“I fluttered around the windowless room like a pigeon in an airport”) as well as short extracts from what appear to be Avery’s cultural reports, which read almost like poems – strange visions of an apocalyptic present or near future.Avery is, of course, miserable – cynical participation in a rigged system can only get you so farIt’s true, too, that there is not much in the way of narrative here. Levy sneaks in a joke about this, with Avery admitting that “when I did manage to write there was no plot, just prose. I told myself this was because I was a socialist or something, uninterested in the commercial potential of books.” There’s a wedding, a funeral, gallery openings and other events – but really these are occasions for Levy to describe the world that her characters move in.The book is itself, in a sense, a cultural report. Sometimes it gets a little too hyperspecific, as in the satirical depictions of New York’s downtown arts scene. But the bigger picture – late-stage capitalism segueing into techno-feudalism, eco-pessimism, a moral arc of the universe that seems to bend not towards justice but away from it – is bleakly relevant to all of us.Perhaps the most vivid aspect is how thoroughly Avery has absorbed the worst values of the contemporary moment, especially in the way she sees herself and Frances as competing objects of sexual commerce. She has no time for feminism, which she notes is no longer fashionable. “It comes as a relief when our romantic relationships reconfigure around regressive ideas about gender,” she writes in one of her reports. She takes tips from an online life coach on how to behave as femininely as possible so that men will want to look after her. She is terrified of ageing. At one stage, she wears a cow-print outfit to a party “to signal fertility”.It would be funny if it weren’t so sad. Avery is, of course, miserable – cynical participation in a rigged system can only get you so far. Flat Earth is not, unsurprisingly, a joyful book. But somewhere in all the irony we might find a glimmer of hope: the hint from Levy that there might be other ways to see the world, which our narrator has not discovered. A therapist, for instance, suggests that she work to “cultivate an inner life”. Avery may feel as though her youth is already dwindling, but she’s only in her 20s. There’s still time for her to grow up.Flat Earth by Anika Jade Levy is published by Abacus (£14.99). To support the Guardian order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Sign up hereNaomi AldermanWed 10 Dec 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 10.02 ESTShareAfew days ago, I clicked a button on my phone to send funds to a company in Singapore and so took ownership of the video game I co-created and am lead writer for:Zombies, Run!I am a novelist, I wrote the bestselling, award-winning The Power, which was turned into an Amazon Prime TV series starring Toni Collette. What on earth am I doing buying a games company?Well. First of all.Zombies, Run! is special. It’s special to me – the game started as a Kickstarter and the community that grew up around it has always been incredibly supportive of what we’re doing. And it’s special in what it does. It’s a game to exercise with. You play it on your smartphone – iPhone or Android – and we tell stories from the zombie apocalypse in your headphones to encourage you to go further, faster, or just make exercise less boring. Games are so often portrayed as the bad entertainment form, but I made a game that fundamentally helps people to be healthier.The experience of playing Zombies, Run! is also completely focused on storytelling. My co-creator Adrian Hon and I were talking about doing a project together. He said: “Let’s do something to make running more fun.” I said: “How about if we do a story where you’re being chased by zombies?” And here we are.When you play the game, you’re immersed in a world where every run makes you a hero – you’re collecting supplies, saving a child from no man’s land, investigating the mystery of how the apocalypse started. I’ve always focused on the storytelling being good. And it works. Players of the game become so attached to the characters that many of them report laughing out loud or even “crying while running”.One of my jokes about storytelling in video games is that the way we tend to talk about it – in the games industry, in games journalism, even in marketing copy – is very much “never mind the quality, feel the width”. We say things like “this game has 100-plus hours of story” or “this game contains more than a million words”. Imagine marketing a movie saying that the script contains 29,000 words. Or selling a novel on the basis that it’ll take a long time to read.View image in fullscreenChasing the narrative … Zombies, Run!Illustration: Simon Garbutt/Zombies Run! LtdThat’s not how you do it. You tell the story. You give a hook. You say: “A single woman comes home one evening to find a man claiming to be her husband living in her house. And when he goes up to the attic, a different husband comes down in his place.” Now you can’t wait to find out what happens next. (That, incidentally, is the brilliant comic novelThe Husbands by Holly Gramazio– who I think is the only other bestselling novelist to be also making her own video games.)So, now I own a games company, what am I going to do? My feeling is that I must focus on the fundamentals. There’s a world of games out there that thinks it can replace writers with AI large language models. I think that’s going to make writing worse and worse. AI writing is fine for boilerplate text that is always roughly the same. It’s fine for non-writers to get their expertise into the world. But storytelling is different. It is human minds finding companionship with other human minds – we need stories, fundamentally, to feel less alone. To know that other people have been through things a bit like what we have. Things that make us laugh, and cry, even while running. You get that from work that is not the same as everything else, you get it from the unique work of other individual human minds.And actually, Zombies, Run! has always been a universe with strong values. We’re not a rightwing, rugged-individualism apocalypse, where one lone person can get through with just their guns. In our world – as in the real world – humans survive by working together.While we’re still going to have many exciting fleeing zombies, battling-the-undead storytelling, I think there’s probably also room in the ZR! universe for a 10-mission arc where you have to find all the figurines and paints you need to complete an expansion set in “Demons and Darkness”; or one where you’re working on bringing an overgrown garden back to blooming, beautiful life; or setting up and running the first post-apocalyptic travelling library while also trying to work out what happened to the first librarian who’s mysteriously disappeared, leaving only a series of cryptic notes in an old manuscript.After all, I do think this is quite a good time in the world to be thinking about how to rebuild after a series of catastrophic events.Selling story by the yard and not by a story hook is a marker, I think, of a lack of confidence in the form. We don’t need to lack confidence. Games arethe biggest entertainment industryin the world. If we want to be taken seriously, we need to take ourselves seriously. Stop talking about the width, start talking about the quality.What to playView image in fullscreenShoot everything that moves … Evil Egg.Photograph: Ivy SlyIt was the 20th anniversary of Xbox 360 recently, and one name that’s cropped up in every list of the console’s best games is the compulsive retro twin-stick shooter Geometry Wars. If you’re yearning for something similar, you must immediately downloadEvil Egg, a frenzied twin-stick blaster with gorgeous Commodore 64-style visuals and sound effects. Shoot everything that moves, hit the left trigger to boost and collect hearts to stay alive.At first it’s a bewildering mass of rainbow pixels but as you detonate wave after wave of glitchy space pests, you begin to understand the patterns of different enemies and earn upgrades such as the executioner’s sword, which takes out foes in an orbital slash of laser particles. Evil Egg is polished, exciting, wild to look at, and has such a brilliant understanding of the genre and its unique dynamics.

It had its premiere in 1735 at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, where the RoyalOperaHouse now stands. Then it was positively demanded that composers and librettists magic up a happy ending from even the most tragic story, sending audiences away uplifted, and Handel duly delivered. However, audiences for the Royal Opera’s new production – surprisingly, its first since that premiere, unless you count a streamed concert during lockdown – might come away with more contradictory feelings.The directorJetske Mijnssen, making her Covent Garden debut, is not convinced by that forced happy ending – which, after her staging of Wagner’sParsifal at Glyndebournethis summer, won’t come as a big surprise. Like the latter piece, here again is a dysfunctional royal family. We’re in the modern palace of a besuited, ailing king; the five children playing at weddings around the dining table during the overture reappear as adults, becoming his two daughters and their three suitors.Spoilt princess Ginevra, who throws designer dresses (courtesy of costume designer Uta Meenen) around for her sister Dalinda to pick up, initially seems to deserve brattish Polinesso rather than playful, earnest Ariodante. But they all have some growing up to do. By the end, when Ariodante is singing his joyful final aria while comforting his traumatised brother, it feels as though Mijnssen is making a dramatic point at the music’s expense, stretching the disjunct between drama and music just too far.View image in fullscreenNo weak link … (from left): Elena Villalón, Emily D’Angelo and Christophe Dumaux in Ariodante.Photograph: Marc BrennerMijnssen’s detailed work shows, and there’s a level of intensity that’s maintained by everyone, right down to the silent uniformed staff enduring the young royals’ thoughtlessness.The cast has no weak link. The countertenor Christophe Dumaux, the only singer to remain from this production’s first run at the Opéra National du Rhin last year, is the jovial yet predatory Polinesso, with Ed Lyon as Ariodante’s nerdy brother Luciano and Elena Villalón as Dalinda. Peter Kellner, his bass exuding gravitas and vulnerability, plays the king.The mezzo-soprano Emily D’Angelo as Ariodante and soprano Jacquelyn Stucker as Ginevra have the long, lonely scenes of introspection that are the opera’s centres of gravity and both have the gleaming tone, technique and magnetism to carry them. Yet neither projects much text: it almost feels as though this is instrumental music.The disjointed feeling is reinforced in the raised pit, where Stefano Montanari conducts the Royal Opera House orchestra, sometimes from the violin. With chamber organ and theorbo standing out starkly, and with Montanari weaving his own embellishments on top of the orchestral violins, it’s inventive and dynamic but often self-consciously so, and doesn’t always let the singers breathe.AtRoyal Opera Houseuntil 21 December.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Firstly, an animal is played on stage, a tiger shot in a Baghdad zoo that returns from the dead to haunt the US marine who pulled the trigger. Secondly, it talks. Wisecracks, in fact, and interrogates the existence of God. A twisted version ofLife of Pi? Certainly it’s less of a dream than a nightmare in which anything could happen.View image in fullscreenThe dead haunt the living … Sayyid Aki as Uday Hussein.Photograph: Ellie KurttzAnd things do lurch from one thing to another with illogical effect. To add to the frisson of unpredictability, Kathryn Hunter performs as the tiger afterDavid Threlfallbowed out, until further notice, due to illness. The part was played on Broadway in 2011 by Robin Williams but Hunter brings her own comic swagger.Director Omar Elerian has shown himself adept at handling absurdist black comedies includingThe Chairs(also starring Hunter) and this is an inspired match. She makes for a reluctantly rock’n’roll tiger, droll in spirit and looking like a female version of Keith Richards with bandana and electric guitar at one point.This is primarily a play about men’s experience of war, following two marines, Kev (Arinzé Kene) and Tom (Patrick Gibson), a Dumb and Dumber double-act with sharper edges, along with their Iraqi interpreter, Musa (Ammar Haj Ahmad), who used to be a gardener to Saddam Hussein’s sons, Uday and Qusay. The few women here are relegated to bit parts: leper, sex worker, abused sister, all reduced to types (is this what war does?). Apart from the tiger, that is, whom Hunter emphatically calls “she”.A wholly unconventional play in which the dead haunt the living, often comically, it seeks to do many things at once. It is theatrical but stilted, ambling in structure as characters wander from a literal landscape of urban collapse into a more symbolic realm of a burnt out Eden.‘It went gangbusters’: the play about the Iraq war – told through the eyes of a starving Baghdad zoo tigerRead moreThe pace is baggy and the tragedy is diffuse, its drama undercut by cerebral questioning. The production’s most enraged moments are downplayed when it could go for the jugular. But the high-wire mix of comedy, horror and intellectualism is brave, the imagination and profundity a breath of fresh air in a theatrical landscape that cleaves to easy entertainment and distraction from darkness. Joseph stares into the Nietzschean abyss, sniggering, and it sniggers back.Rajha Shakiry’s set is a burning city that turns biblical, characters lost in the wilderness of a strange, liminal afterlife, trapped by grief or guilt, especially Musa, who feels perpetual regret for unwittingly putting his sister into the predatory hands of Uday (Sayyid Aki). The latter is his tormentor, coming back with Qusay’s (whispering!) head in a bag, and becomes a deliciously dark comic highlight.As a play, it repeats itself and does not know how to end.

An adaptation of Dahl’s 1982 book about a counter-intuitive ogre who befriends an orphan is a hoped-for Christmas gift to the coffers of an organisation makingbudget-trimming job cuts.But, where Matilda was always confidently a comedy musical, The BFG feels stylistically to be juggling different shows. Adapted by Tom Wells with additional material from dramaturg Jenny Worton, the show has a strand of spoken drama, somewhat reminiscent of Sue Townsend’s The Queen and I, with a quasi-Elizabeth II, sweetly played by Helena Lymbery, saving the nation with child superhero helpers.Lilliputian to-and-fro  … John Leader as The BFG at the Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon.Photograph: Marc BrennerA second element is a sort of puppet ballet (mannequin designer and director Toby Olié) where giants and “human beans” are choreographed to music with no lyrics. Blame Matilda but I had to fight the expectation or hope that the characters would sing; sometimes a line of dialogue, such as the need to dream big, seems so clearly to cue a number that we can almost hear it.Visually, the show plays with perspective, a Lilliputian to-and-fro in which sometimes the 12ft-high mechanical BFG looms over the human Sophie (Ellemie Shivers on press night) but otherwise the actor playing the giant, John Leader, towers above a tiny puppet Sophie. There seems, though, no clear logic to why either main character is big/small or flesh/fabric at any moment other than that the alternative featured in the previous scene.Dahl’s work became the subject of contention in 2023 whenPuffin Books released expurgated editionsremoving language and attitudes considered offensively dated. After a public row, the first versions continued to be published, as The Roald Dahl Classic Collection, alongside the cleansed texts, effectively giving the RSC the choice of two books to stage.Readers of sanitised rather than legacy texts are more likely to recognise Wells’ and Worton’s work. Their excisions include a section about how humans of different nationalities taste to giants. Bad taste is such a part of Dahl that the risk is to leave the residue with little tang at all.The performers are impeccable under the direction of RSC co-head Daniel Evans. Yet with the BFG and baddie giant Bloodbottler divided between an actor, a puppet and four on-stage puppeteers, coherent characterisation can be lost;Paddington: The Musicalmore seamlessly combines acting, animatronics and voices projected from backstage.Showing the complexities of theatrical funding now, The BFG is a co-production with theatres in Chichester and Singapore. Audiences will have enough fun but, while intermittently showing the RSC’s artistic power, this sadly doesn’t feel like the giant hit its finances need.AtRoyal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 7 February.

She studied music at New College, Oxford, before switching to Philosophy, Politics and Economics. After graduation, she became a financial journalist, but she said she found the job dull. During the long commute to central London, she would read paperbacks by the likes of Mary Wesley and Joanna Trollope, and began wanting to write a book.At 24, she wrote her first novel, The Tennis Party, about a group of friends who take part in a weekend tournament. “My overriding concern was that I didn’t write the autobiographical first novel,” Wickhamtold the Guardianin 2012. “I was so, so determined not to write about a 24-year-old journalist. It was going to have male characters, and middle-aged people, so I could say, look, I’m not just writing about my life, I’m a real author.”The Tennis Party was the first of seven novels Wickham wrote under her real name, published yearly between 1995 and 2001, including Cocktails for Three, The Wedding Girl, Sleeping Arrangements and The Gatecrasher. Sleeping Arrangements was adapted as a musical by Chris Burgess.The Madeleine Wickham books are “rather different” from her later Sophie Kinsella books, said the author. “They’re a bit more serious, a bit darker and are all ensemble pieces without a main heroine, but groups of characters whose lives interlink in some way.”View image in fullscreenIsla Fisher in the film adaptation of Confessions of a Shopaholic.Photograph: Robert Zuckerman/APWickham submitted her first manuscript written under the name Sophie Kinsella, The Secret Dreamworld of a Shopaholic, without revealing her identity to her publishers. The book – issued as Confessions of a Shopaholic in some countries – was published in 2000 and became the first of 10 instalments in the Shopaholic series. The stories follow Becky Bloomwood, a financial journalist with a spending problem. “I thought, wait a minute, shopping has become the national pastime, and nobody has written about it,” said Wickham. “It felt very much like an experimental project.”The series’ first and second novels – the latter titled Shopaholic Abroad – were adapted for film. Confessions of a Shopaholic, directed by PJ Hogan and starring Isla Fisher and Hugh Dancy, was released in 2009.Beginning in 2003, Wickham also published standalone novels as Sophie Kinsella. These include Can You Keep a Secret?, The Undomestic Goddess and Remember Me?. Her most recent standalone, published in 2023, is titled The Burnout, which she was inspired to write after experiencing it herself and seeing it “around [her] everywhere”. Protagonist Sasha goes to a Devon beach resort she loved as a child to recuperate from burnout, but finds the once grand hotel now dilapidated, and has to share the beach with the grumpy Finn.“The wonderful response to The Burnout has really buoyed me up during a difficult time,” wrote Wickham in the announcement of her cancer diagnosis. Public messages of support came from Fisher, who played Becky inConfessions of a Shopaholic, as well as romance writer Moyes and thriller writer Gillian McAllister.Sophie Kinsella: ‘You can be highly intelligent – and also ditzy and klutzy’Read moreWickham’s novels have often been classified as “chick lit”, owing to the romcom-esque situations her often ditzy heroines find themselves in. Yet Wickham considered the term “chick lit” to mean “third-person contemporary funny” novels. “You can be highly intelligent, and also ditzy and klutzy,” said Wickham. “You can be unable to cook, you can like lipstick. And I think it’s more realistic to represent women having all these facets.”Wickham also created the children’s book series Mummy Fairy and Me, published between 2018 and 2020. In 2015, she wrote a young adult novel, Finding Audrey, about a teenage girl with social anxiety.Wickham met her husband, Henry Wickham, on her first night at Oxford University, and married him when she was 21. She is survived by her husband and their five children.Explore more on these topicsBooksSophie KinsellaRomance booksFictionnewsShareReuse this content"

Over the years, it has been home to the first screenings of films including Get Out, Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Blair Witch Project, Past Lives, Napoleon Dynamite, Precious and Little Miss Sunshine.Charli xcx will be seen in three films premiering at the 2026 festival, led byThe Moment, a mockumentary where she plays a version of herself. “It’s not a tour documentary or a concert film in any way, but the seed of the idea was conceived from this idea of being pressured to make one,” she has said of the film. It also stars Rachel Sennott,Alexander Skarsgård, Kate Berlant and Kylie Jenner.She will also appear alongside Portman in dark comedy thriller The Gallerist. The film centres on a gallerist trying to sell a dead man at Miami’s Art Basel. It’s co-written and directed by Cathy Yan, whose last film was DC spin-off Birds of Prey. The cast also includesJenna Ortega, Sterling K Brown, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Zach Galifianakis.View image in fullscreenCooper Hoffman and Olivia Wilde in I Want Your Sex.Photograph: Lacey TerrellThe singer’s third film is I Want Your Sex, an erotic thriller from Mysterious Skin director Gregg Araki, marking his first film since 2014. It stars Cooper Hoffman as a young man who starts working for a provocative artist, played byOlivia Wilde, and soon finds himself in “a world of sex, obsession, power, betrayal, and murder”, according to the synopsis.Wilde will also premiere “provocative date night comedy” The Invite, her directorial follow-up to Don’t Worry Darling which follows two couples spilling secrets at a dinner party. She stars with Seth Rogen, Edward Norton andPenélope Cruz.Rushdie heads up a strong section of documentary premieres withKnife: The Attempted Murder of Salman Rushdie, a new film directed by Alex Gibney that will feature unseen footage captured by the author’s wife as he recovers from the 2022 attack. “The opportunity to make this film about his recovery – in the broadest sense of the term – comes at a critical time,” Gibney said. “It gives me hope.”There will also be documentaries onMarianne Faithfull, Brittney Griner, Courtney Love, Nelson Mandela, Billie Jean King and the Harlem Renaissance as well as the new project from John Wilson, where he learns how to make a Hallmark movie and uses the same template to try to sell a film about concrete. Ta-Nehisi Coates will also collaborate with director Dawn Porter for wrongful conviction documentary When A Witness Recants while Navalny director Daniel Roher returns with a cautionary film about AI.View image in fullscreenOlivia Colman in Wicker.Photograph: Lol CrawleyOlivia Colman, who has previously premiered The Father and Jimpa at Sundance, will return with offbeat romance Wicker which sees her star as a “smelly, single and perpetually ridiculed” fisher who commissions a basket maker to create a husband, leading to “outrage, jealousy and chaos”. Skarsgård, Peter Dinklage and Elizabeth Debicki star alongside.As he gains Oscar buzz for his role in Richard Linklater’s Blue Moon,Ethan Hawkewill next be seen in The Weight, a 1930s drama about gold smuggling that co-stars Russell Crowe. Chris Pine will star opposite Jenny Slate in Carousel, a film where he plays a doctor whose life unravels. That film will be playing in competition alongside titles including Run Amok, about a teenage girl staging a musical based on a shooting that happened at her high school, and the Channing Tatum-starring Josephine about a young girl who witnesses a crime which causes her to spiral.Sundance has become a key destination for new horror films with previous years seeing films including Saw, Hereditary and The Babadook premiering.

Todd herself wrote Kiss and Kill (with Ann Mitchell) about domestic violence (1977-78), and – in 1979 – collaborated with me on the company’s first play involving a male writer, bringing the worlds of student revolution and schoolgirl romance into crashing contradiction, inTeendreams. As in all of the early Monstrous Regiment shows, Todd was also a member of the acting company.Bryony Lavery’s Weimar-style cabaret show, Time, Gentlemen, Please (1978), caused controversy in its exploration of sexual desire and glamour (howled down in Leeds by what Todd described as “the Anti-Glitter Brigade”), as did an adaptation of Anita Loos’s Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (intended to rescueLoos’s feminist classicfrom the grip of the Monroe film) the following year.View image in fullscreenAfter her period with the Monsters, Todd combined directing with teachingDifferences within the company led Todd to leave the Monsters in the early 1980s, but she put her skill at and affection for iconoclastic theatre to work as co-director of the endearingly titled NationalTheatreof Brent. Led by Patrick Barlow in the persona of the quixotic Desmond Dingle, the company aimed to demonstrate that, with enough persistence, two actors could perfectly well present the stories of The Charge of the Light Brigade, The Black Hole of Calcutta and Götterdämmerung.As a freelance director, Todd returned to Monstrous Regiment to direct their 10th anniversary production (My Song Is Free, by Jorge Díaz) in 1986. Other noted productions include her own adaptation of Benefits by Zoe Fairbairn at the Albany Empire, Deptford (1980),Stephen Lowe’s Keeping Body and Soul Together at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs(1984), and the acclaimed English language premiere of Marguerite Duras’s Savannah Bay for the Foco Novo company (1988).In the mid-80s, she directed two plays by Deborah Levy: Pax forSphinx theatreand Heresies for the Royal Shakespeare Company. Todd joinedAnnie Castledineduring the latter’s directorship of Derby Playhouse between 1987 and 1990, the pair producing highly visual theatrical presentation of rediscovered classics, such as Gaslight and Arsenic and Old Lace, continental plays and plays by women.Todd was born Lily Susan into a working-class family in Stourbridge in the West Midlands (she was to use her middle name professionally, but reverted to Lily in later life). Her mother, Violet (nee Harrison), had a wide range of jobs, from working at a greyhound track to teaching assistant at a primary school. Her father, Peter, found it hard to hold down jobs, but was a passionate amateur actor, which opened his daughter’s eyes to the wonders of theatre.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Chris Montag/Courtesy of Monstrous RegimentShe hated school, but her A-levels (studied by correspondence course) won her a place at the newly founded Sussex University in the mid 60s, which she adored, studying English and philosophy and being recruited into the Communist party by the aspirant theatre directorBuzz Goodbody. The Communist party was attractive to Todd for its genuinely working-class base, but she was also increasingly influenced by the emergent women’s liberation movement, and caught up in the theatre that promoted it. There is still documentary footage of Todd on a demonstration singing – with bitter irony – Keep Young and Beautiful (“It’s your duty to be beautiful … if you want to be loved”).In 1969, Todd inherited Goodbody’s first RSC job as the directorJohn Barton’s assistant. Having directed As You Like It on the company’s main stage, Goodbody was asked to run the new, experimental studio space (the Other Place) that she had campaigned for. Her thrilling 1975 chamber production of Hamlet (with Ben Kingsley as the prince) would have turned the tide of her career, but proved too late: she killed herself four days into its run. In 2005, Todd would produce a commemorative event at the RSC, Remembering Buzz, to mark the 30th anniversary of her death.Following her own apprenticeship at the RSC, Todd won a place on ATV’s repertory theatre trainee programme, learning her director’s craft in various regional theatres, with productions of Arthur Miller, Noël Coward, Arthur Schnitzler and others. By the mid-70s, however, it was clear that small-scale, alternative theatre had become the leading cultural site for the growing feminist movement of which Todd was a part.In 1973, the expatriate American director Ed Berman handed over his Almost-Free theatre for a short season of plays by women. Todd was one of the directors of this groundbreaking season, which included work byPam Gems, Michelene Wandor and Jane Wibberley, and gave birth to the first two of many feminist troupes, the Women’s Company and the Women’s Theatre Group. By 1975, there was also a growing cohort of feminist theatre-makers who were dissatisfied with male-dominated leftwing theatre groups such as 7:84 and Belt and Braces, including Hanna and McCusker, and Monstrous Regiment was born.View image in fullscreenThe Monstrous Regiment theatre company, with Todd sitting on the far left.Photograph: Courtesy of Monstrous RegimentAfter her period with the Monsters, Todd combined directing with teaching, first at Wimbledon School of Art, where she headed an MA in scenography, and then at Dartington College of Arts, where she added further physical theatre skills to her rigorously text-based, Stanislavski-influenced approach. At Rose Bruford College she taught – among others – the writer Bernardine Evaristo and the director Paulette Randall. From 1997 to 2003, she was acting training tutor at Trinity College Dublin, where her productions included Brecht’s The Good Person of Szechuan, Ostrovsky’s Artists and Admirers, and Marivaux’s The Triumph of Love.Returning to London, she both taught and directed at Central School until 2012, where her noted productions ranged from the American radical Clifford Odets’s Paradise Lost to Gorky’s Children of the Sun and Coward’s Semi-Monde.In 1966 Todd had married Peter Horne. They divorced, and in 1998 she married Chris Wicking, who died in 2008. In 2011, after Peter was diagnosed with Parkinson’s, he and Todd remarried, moving to Aldeburgh in Suffolk until Peter’s death six years later.Todd’s brother predeceased her.

Past co-chairs have included everyone from Zendaya to Harry Styles, Rihanna to Donatella Versace and Lin-Manuel Miranda to Sarah Jessica Parker.This year’s co-chairs will be presiding over a Met Gala themed around Costume Art, to tie in with the Costume Institute’s spring 2026 exhibition. Announced last month, the exhibition, which will be on view to the public from 10 May, aims to explore the body and fashion in art by pairing paintings, sculptures and other objects from the Met’s collection with 200 historical and contemporary garments from the Costume Institute: a 16th-century painting of Adam and Eve by Albrecht Düre with an ensemble by Belgian designer Walter Van Beirendonck, say, or a photograph of a body called La Poupeé with a Rei Kawakubo creation for Comme des Garçons.As curator Andrew Bolton said in a press release at the time: “I wanted to focus on the centrality of the dressed body within the museum, connecting artistic representations of the body with fashion as an embodied artform.”The exhibition will be organised into a series of thematic body types, including the naked body, the anatomical body, the ageing body and the pregnant body. It will be the first exhibition at the Costume Institute’s new permanent galleries at the Met: the new, nearly 10,000ft Condé M Nast Galleries have been named for the company’s late founder.The exhibition’s theme, which is famously interpreted, sometimes to spectacular effect, by stylists and celebrities, is likely to inspire some interesting outfits at the Gala. It seems likely that there will be takes on naked dressing, musings on mannequins and celebrations of physicality, not least from the newly announced co-chairs. The Met has in the past famously hosted Rihanna in her so-called “omelette dress” and Diana Ross in a train so long it needed two assistants.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos were also recently announced as the main sponsors for 2026’s Met Gala,marking a deeper push into the fashion world and drawing criticism on social media.Anthony Vaccarello, creative director of Yves Saint Laurent, and the actor Zoë Kravitz will co-chair the Met Gala host committee, with additional members including Doja Cat, Sabrina Carpenter, Gwendoline Christie, Lena Dunham and Wintour’s successor at Vogue, Chloe Malle.Explore more on these topicsFashionMet GalaNew YorkCelebritynewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Retailers, from supermarkets to artisan independents, are developing huge ranges of scented candles, and it’s hard to know where to start, and what’s any good. Many of us have been disappointed by a candle that smelled divine when we had an in-store sniff, only to be distinctly underwhelming once it’s home. So we’ve sniffed, burned and rated dozens of candles for you.Most of our picks are an affordable £28 or below (scented candles can routinely cost £70 and upwards). Fragrance can be extremely personal, so we asked companies for their most consistently popular candles.A candle’s ability to fill a room with its scent – or not – is known as its “throw”. We concentrated our hunt on candles with a superb aromaanda great throw, ignoring branding and packaging – although apothecary-style brown glass jars seem to be pretty much compulsory now.

In cheaper candles, paraffin wax is frequently the main ingredient as it’s inexpensive and a good vehicle for fragrance. Many luxury brands will still include a little paraffin, because it’s effective at maximising scent throw. But it’s a petroleum derivative and releases harmful VOCs and soot into the air when burned.Any fragrances used in the home will impact indoor air quality to some extent, so use them sparingly and make sure the space is well ventilated. You can also help to offset your candle habit by using an air purifier, regularly dusting and cleaning, and using a vacuum cleaner with a Hepa filter. To minimise the risks, look for candles made with natural waxes such as soy, rapeseed, coconut or beeswax, and scented with pure essential oils.If you’re buying high-street candles that come in various sizes, avoid the smaller versions where possible, and buy those with the widest diameter you can afford to maximise the throw. If you do end up with a candle that gives out limited fragrance, use it in a smaller room: zhoosh up the loo when guests come over, or create a home-spa feel in the bathroom.To get the most out of your candle, burn it for at least two hours and up to four hours at a time to avoid tunnelling – that’s when a candle burns down the centre but the outer wax doesn’t melt. Some cheaper candles will tunnel regardless, though. On the flip side, burning a candle for too long can mean it gets too hot and produces unnecessary amounts of smoke. Before relighting a candle, always trim the wick to about 5mm, again to prevent smoke.To use candles safely, place them on a stable, heat-resistant surface, away from draughts and flammable materials, and never leave them unattended. Discard the candle when there’s a centimetre or two of wax still left to burn, to prevent overheating.Kate Jacobs is awriterspecialising in design, interiors and gardens.She gets the biggest buzz from finding pieces for her own home at car boot fairs and charity shops, and even things dumped in the street.

Here are some of their stories.‘Within weeks, something beautiful happened’When Jemma Brown set up a community choir in Wiltshire in April 2021, she was worried no one would turn up. In fact, 50 people attended, and the choir has gone from strength to strength.‘A mega-mechanism for bonding’: why singing together does us goodRead more“We began as a small group of people who just loved music, but within weeks, something beautiful happened,” says Jemma, from Devizes. “The sound grew stronger; people started to smile more, friendships formed, and our weekly rehearsals became the highlight of the week for everyone, me included.“Some have found new best friends. We have one member who joined when she was 17, and she became friends with an 82-year-old. Others say it’s helped them through grief, isolation, or anxiety. After one practice, one of my members came up to me and thanked me, adding: “This is the first time I’ve laughed since I lost my husband.”The choir has sung across the UK, including in the Fultone Festival and with Aled Jones, but Jemma says there is also something special about their practice sessions.“The most powerful moments are still when we sing together in our local hall – hearing 80 voices rise as one, feeling the room buzz with energy and connection. A choir isn’t just about music; it’s about community, wellbeing, friendship, and joy.”Jemma Brown, 50, who runsthe Big Sound Choir in Devizes, Wiltshire‘Choir kept my dad going for such a long time’Jill’s father, Byron, had to give up playing clarinet when Parkinson’s took hold.Photograph: Jill/Guardian Community​​When Jill semi-retired from teaching, it meant she was able to take her father, Bryon, who had Parkinson’s, to the community choir Music for Everyone.“Music had always been part of his life; he sang in a church choir, played clarinet, and after he retired from lecturing in maths at a university, he ran a sheet music shop from his garage until he was 80,” says Jill from Nottingham.“Once Parkinson’s took hold, he had to give the shop up; he could no longer play the clarinet, and he left the church choir because he couldn’t manage it. Then he couldn’t drive anymore. Gradually, the social life he’d had kind of shut down, and he wasn’t really interested in doing anything much.”Jill suggested she go with him to Music for Everyone. “Going to the choir was fantastic for my Dad’s wellbeing; it lifted his spirits to be part of a community again,” she says.Byron went to choir for about three years before a fall in August 2018 meant he could no longer attend. He died aged 88 in December that year.“When we first went, Dad was able to walk in, he could join the cup of tea queue and chat to people,” says Jill. “Singing helped the muscles to prolong his ability to speak, it kept him connected to a community, and the feel-good factor lasted for days after. Our family were even able to watch him perform at the Albert Hall in Nottingham, years after we thought his performing days were over.”Jill Gaunt, 66, teacher, Nottingham‘I feel more connected to my community’View image in fullscreenSome of the Lewisham Creative Chorus (Bea in the front centre in the black-and-white dress).Photograph: Handout/Guardian CommunityBea has been singing in the Lewisham Creative Chorus for the past two years, and says she loves being part of “an eclectic group with all ages, colours and nationalities”.“Tom, our artistic director, is so lovely and sometimes I think: ‘My God, how does he have the patience?’” she says. “We’re all such different characters, yet he just pulls us all together. People are singing from the heart, and when you’re singing from the heart, you can’t go wrong.“Anyone can join the choir. You don’t really have to be a good singer, although some people can really sing. We write our own songs and put on various performances. We did an opera last year – our own made-up one, and the music was lovely.“I think being in the choir has changed me. It has widened my social circle, made me feel more connected to my local community and aware of issues on my doorstep. It has also given me a love and appreciation for opera, as well as an outlet for creativity and singing.“I do really have to pinch myself that I am involved in such a marvellous community choir.”Bea Joseph, 59, careers adviser, south-east London ​​‘It’s just nice to be a part of something where difference doesn’t matter’View image in fullscreenKatie, who studied performing arts, says singing provides a form of ‘escapism’.Photograph: Handout/Guardian CommunityKatie has been part of the Chelmsford Musical Theatre Choir on and off for the past two years and says she has made lifelong friends there.“I’m disabled, and for me it’s escapism when I sing,” says Katie, who studied performing arts and lives in Chelmsford. “It’s so amazing to feel a part of something when society normally feels so separated. I get so much out of it and have met so many incredible people. It’s just nice to be a part of something where difference doesn’t matter. We also have other wheelchair users in our choir – it’s nice to feel like you’re not the only one.“Because I am looking for work, choir practice is my only real sense of routine in my week, and I really look forward to it. The community events we do are so incredibly exciting, from singing in care homes to performing at Christmas markets and at events to raise money for charity.”“I have made lifelong friends, and I’m really proud to be a part of it.”Katie, 23, Chelmsford, a member of the Chelmsford Musical Theatre Choir‘Choir is the highlight of my week’After Pat moved to Wales from Nuneaton, he realised he needed to do something if he was to make new friends.“Like, I suspect, a lot of middle-aged men, I had focused on work and family for decades and had let many friendships slip,” he says. “I got divorced, and my social circle diminished further; then, during the pandemic, my employers decided that we would work from home full-time.”He was browsing on Facebook when he saw a group inviting people to join the Porthmadog Pop Choir. “I knew I had to get out of my comfort zone,” says Pat. “I wasn’t sure what to expect. Would there be an audition? There wasn’t, thankfully.“I’m not exaggerating when I say that Wednesday nights are the highlight of my week now. I’ve always loved music, been moved by music, so of course, singing is a huge part of it. But so, too, are the people I’ve met, the friends I’ve made, the sheer level of banter and hilarity we have some nights.“It’s been a little under two years since I joined, and it’s one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.”Pat Ryan, 58, NHSdata analyst,Trawsfynydd, north WalesExplore more on these topicsCommunitiesChoral musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You wouldn’t believe it’s the same home!”The space, lined with sound-blocking panels, is a sanctuary for her autistic son: a quiet cocoon for decompressing after school. “He loves to go in there to game online with his mates,” Clonan says.Diagnosed autistic at 37, Clonan lives in a weatherboard cottage with her husband, Chris, and her two neurodivergent teenagers. Since buying the house five years ago, she has been reshaping it around their needs. “Our family’s split half-half – 50% sensory-seek versus sensory-avoidant,” she says. “I chase light. I love light-filled everything. But my son really is the opposite.”View image in fullscreenClonan’s son has a sound-blocked sanctuary to retreat to after school.Photograph: Charlie Kinross/The GuardianAs diagnoses of autism and ADHD rise, Clonan is among a growing number of Australians rethinking how their homes can support neurodivergent needs. “We all deserve to live in a home that’s designed for the way our brains work,” Clonan says. “We spend so much of our lives trying to fit into spaces that were never built for us.”It’s an idea echoed by architect and design psychology researcher Dr Jan Golembiewski, who studies how the built environment affects the mind. “It can ease symptoms, even heal,” he says. “For someone with ADHD, it’s about building in positive affordances – things that invite focus, calm and a sense of ease.”He likens it to “designing the stage set for the behaviour you want to see”: arranging a space so it supports what you need to do. “Even in a small apartment, you can create distinct zones for work and rest,” he says.A home in balanceClonan’s redesign began with a family conversation, mapping each member’s “sensory quadrant” using the Dunn Model of Sensory Processing, which helps people understand how they respond to sensory input. Two of them seek stimulation; two prefer calm.View image in fullscreenClonan’s main living areas are bright, colourful and open-plan – which suits her sensory-seeking daughter and husband.Photograph: Charlie Kinross/The GuardianView image in fullscreenA second living space in Clonan’s home has black-painted walls and soft, calming fabrics.Photograph: Charlie Kinross/The GuardianThe result is a home in balance. Their bright, colourful, open-plan living area suits her sensory-seeking daughter and husband, while their second living room provides a quiet counterpoint, with black-painted walls, light-filtering shutters and soft, calming fabrics. “Myself and my son are both sensory avoidant,” Clonan says. “The only thing with me is I can handle a lot of light, as long as it’s natural and daylight. I can’t stand fluorescent lighting.”We’re designing around how someone actually lives: their sequencing, their rituals, their sensory patternsEddie Page, architectHer approach is also practical. “It’s a highly organised home,” she says. “It has to be because we’ve got a lot of forgetful souls. If we can’t see something, we forget it exists. There’s one tray in our fridge that isn’t see-through. We call it the Bermuda Triangle, because what goes in doesn’t come out.”Reducing the daily dragEddie Page, a Newcastle-based architect and co-founder of firm Maxwell & Page, was diagnosed with ADHD at 13. He says it gives him a sharper sense of how spaces make people feel.That philosophy guided the J-Pod, a compact studio he designed in a suburban back yard for 22-year-old Josie, who has ADHD and autism. The 16 square metre home had to do everything. “Sleeping, cooking, washing, resting, all within the footprint of a single room,” he says.To avoid sensory overload, Page kept the palette simple. “With ADHD and autism, clutter can be the enemy,” he says. Walls are lined with hoop pine plywood, which he describes as “like a nice cocoon, like a hug”. Storage is neatly out of sight. “The kitchen and storage are tucked away so when you’re in bed you can’t see the mess,” he says.View image in fullscreenClonan’s back yard has cocoon-like slings for the kids.Photograph: Charlie Kinross/The GuardianLight and temperature were tuned to Josie’s preferences. “She’s a bit of a cold frog,” Page says. “She wanted a sealed, air-conditioned box with the blinds down all the time.” Blockout blinds and insulation keep the space cool and quiet, while a high window allows in filtered northern light.Page designs around the flow of daily life. “We’re not just ticking off a list of rooms – we’re designing around how someone actually lives: their sequencing, their rituals, their sensory patterns. It’s about finding ways to reduce the daily drag of getting tasks done.”For Josie, the shift into a purpose-built space has been transformative. “Having the independence of living on my own has been great for my wellbeing … and though it’s too small to have many separate rooms, it still has clear zones so I can separate my headspace.” She describes the studio as having a “natural and calming feeling”.View image in fullscreenNeurodivergent-friendly toys and crafts are kept under the kitchen bench at Clonan’s house.Photograph: Charlie Kinross/The GuardianClinical psychologist Luisa Livingstone says many people with ADHD or autism spend their days “masking” – working hard to focus, filter out noise and keep up socially – and often come home mentally spent. “Everyday chores can feel impossible when your motivational energy is already gone,” she says.“Design and layout can make a real difference. If everything you need is in one place and you don’t have to search or decide, it’s far more achievable.”Clonan believes shaping a home around her family’s sensory needs has brought them closer together. “My son’s a teenager and yet he respects us so much because he feels safe here. Whatever happens out there, you’ve got the safest place to come home to, and it’s a home that knows your brain. It won’t mock you for the things that that brain needs.”View image in fullscreenWeighted blankets on one of the children’s bedrooms at Clonan’s house in Melbourne.Photograph: Charlie Kinross/The GuardianPage takes a similar view. He’s focused on building a future where difference is part of the design process rather than an afterthought. “I think the best designers are empathetic,” he says.“You’re designing for somebody else, you’re designing for somebody’s experience. You’re trying to see the world through their eyes. That’s what good design is about.”Explore more on these topicsHomesAustralian lifestyleAutismAttention deficit hyperactivity disorderInterior designNeurodiversityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sticky, sweet and complex, these boozy treats are wonderful spooned over rice pudding, porridge, yoghurt, ice-cream or even panna cotta.Don’t waste a fresh tea bag, though – enjoy a cuppa first, then use the spent one to infuse the prunes overnight. Earl grey adds fragrant, citrus notes, builders’ tea gives a malty depth, lapsang souchong brings smokiness, and chamomile or rooibos offer softer, floral tones. It’s also worth experimenting with other dried fruits beyond prunes: apricots, figs and/or dates all work beautifully, too.Tea-soaked prunes (or dried fruit)I like to give a jar of preserves as a gift whenever I’m invited somewhere for dinner, and this recipe turns a handful of dried fruit and a spent teabag into something that feels like a real treat. It’s the perfect way to stretch the lifespan of ingredients that might otherwise be forgotten: dried fruit at the back of the cupboard, a heel of citrus, even a used teabag. The tannins in tea balance the sweetness of the fruit beautifully, while a splash of whisky, brandy or rum lends a gentle warmth.50g dark brown sugar1 piece citrus peel(optional)1 used teabag200-250g dried prunes, or apricots, figs and/or dates1 cap whisky, or brandy (optional)Put the sugar (I use dark brown for richness), an optional piece of citrus peel and a used teabag in a clean 500ml jar. Pour in about 350ml just-boiled water and leave to infuse for about 10 minutes, until the water is warm but not hot. Add 200-250g dried prunes), cover, seal and leave to infuse overnight. I like a strong brew, so I leave the bag in until the next morning, so take it out earlier if you prefer a subtler flavour.The next day, strain the syrup from the jar into a small pan, bring to a boil and reduce by about two-thirds, until thick and glossy. Pour the syrup back over the soaked fruit and, if you like, add a splash of whisky or brandy. Seal the jar, give it a little shake and put in the fridge, where the prunes will now keep for at least a month, ready for spooning over desserts or gifting to a friend.Explore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkWaste notFoodFood wasteFruitTeaDessertChristmasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For spice lovers, this moreish Mexican brittle, which is inspired by salsa macha (a delicious chilli-crunch), is sweet, salty, smoky, crunchy and has hints of anise. Then, for savoury lovers, some cheesy pinwheel cookies enlivened with XO sauce. XO is a deeply umami condiment from Hong Kong made from dried seafood, salty ham, chilli and spices. Paired with tangy manchego, it adds a funky kick to these crumbly biscuits.Mexican pumpkin seed and salted spice brittlePrep5 minCook25 min, plus coolingServes6-8100g pumpkin seeds125g salted peanuts2tbsp coriander seeds2tbsp fennel seeds2tsp caraway seeds1tsp dried oregano2tbsp sesame seeds2tsp ancho chilli powder or smoked paprika2tsp smoked salt, crushed to powder70g butter300g caster sugarIn a large, dry frying pan or skillet, toast the pumpkin seeds, stirring the whole time, for two to three minutes, until they start to pop and tint brown. Tip into a large bowl and leave to cool completely. Repeat with the peanuts, until they just tint brown, then tip into the bowl.In the same pan, dry toast the coriander seeds, fennel seeds, caraway seeds and dried oregano for a minute or two, until they take on just a little colour and release their aromas; take care not to burn them. Pour into the nut bowl.Finally, dry toast the sesame seeds for 30-45 seconds, until they just tint brown, then tip into the bowl. Add the chilli powder and smoked salt, mix well and set aside.Have ready a large rectangle of nonstick baking paper or a large silicon baking mat. Heat the butter in a large pan until fully melted, then add the caster sugar and 50ml cold water. Swirl the pan gently over a medium-high heat (do not over-stir, because the mix can easily crystallise) for five or six minutes, until the mix turns a deep caramel colour and reaches 155C on a sugar thermometer – this is important, because it’s the hard crack point for the sugar.Quickly pour in the nuts, seeds and spices, mix thoroughly, then pour evenly on to the baking paper – take care, because it will be hot. Put a sheet of greaseproof paper on top of the mix and use a rolling pin to flatten it out into an even layer about ¾cm thick. Peel off the top sheet of paper, leave to cool completely, then snap into shards and enjoy. They’ll keep for a month in an airtight container.Manchego and XO-poppyseed pinwheelsView image in fullscreenCheesy whatsits: Gurdeep Loyal’s manchego and XO-poppyseed pinwheels.Prep15 minChill45 minCook50 minMakes25-303tbsp XO sauce(I use Lee Kum Kee) – if you can’t find any, mix 3 tbsp Chinese chilli crisp with ¾ tsp shrimp paste50g black poppy seeds2tbsp white-wine vinegarSugar350g plain flour,plus extra for dusting½tsp baking powder1½tsp black pepper, coarsely crushed1½tsp English mustard powder2tbsp coarse semolinaFine salt200g butter, cold and cubed150g manchego, finely grated50g parmesan, finely grated2 large egg yolks, whiskedIn a small blender, whizz the XO sauce, black poppy seeds, white-wine vinegar and a pinch of sugar for one to two minutes, scraping down the sides halfway, until you have a consistent coarse paste. Add a splash of water to loosen, if need be, then scrape into a bowl, cover and chill.Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, black pepper, mustard powder, semolina and a half-teaspoon of fine salt. Using your fingers, rub in the butter cubes until the mix resembles even, small, damp breadcrumbs with no lumps. Mix in the cheeses.Add the eggs yolks, then use your hands just to bring everything together into a dough, adding two teaspoons of ice-cold water. (Don’t over-knead; add an extra one or two teaspoons of water, if needed.) Press into a very tight ball with no cracks, then shape into a flattened square about 20cm x 20cm x 2½cm. Wrap in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for 15 minutes.Put the dough on a floured surface, cut it in half vertically, then put one half on top of the other. Roll into a large rectangle about 40cm x 30cm x ½cm, pressing together any cracks.Use a spatula to spread the XO-poppy seed filling in an even layer over the dough. Carefully and tightly roll from the top to the bottom, a bit like a Swiss roll (don’t worry if it cracks). Slice the log into 1cm-thick cookies, then arrange on two oven sheets lined with baking paper. Rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Bake the cookies for 16-18 minutes, rotating the trays once halfway, until golden brown. If you like, sprinkle with an extra grating of manchego three minutes before the cooking time is up. Remove, leave to cool completely on a rack, then store. The cookies will keep for a week in an airtight container.Flavour Heroes: 15 Modern Pantry Ingredients to Amplify Your Cooking, by Gurdeep Loyal, is published by Quadrille at £27.

The Guardian put the idea to the test.First we tried asking for possible gifts for a middle-aged man who enjoys running and photography. The market-leading chatbot ChatGPT suggested: a Canon lens for £129 from Argos; a Koospur tennis racket sensor tracker for £71.72 on Amazon; and a Boondocker recycled camera bag for £34.98. The AI platform insisted the “ideal present” would be the camera bag, plus maybe the tennis sensor tracker. It also threw in experience ideas such as tennis coaching, whisky tasting or live music.When asked to work with a more restricted budget it suggested tennis racket-emblazoned socks for £18, which were ugly and definitely not worth the high price tag.The answers skewed heavily towards big online retailers, with seven of the nine initial suggestions from Amazon. Asking for ideas from more niche companies led to a minimalist tennis court print for £30 from a website called theSmart Party Shopand vague advice to buy from “Etsy or Not On the High Street-type sellers”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, with a nudge for more cult picks it steered towards a £17.50 Odylique rose moisturiser gift set, which it described as “luxurious but not mainstream”. It also put forward a £30 Floris sandalwood and patchouli-scented candle, which it claimed was “more personal than just another lipstick”.When asked to recommend DIY tools, it suggested a small, pink kit with some rather useless-looking pliers, rather than the usual all-purpose devices such as drills, sanders and staple guns – a sign that the longstanding complaint thatAI reinforces gender stereotypesremains.The Guardian then instructed the AI to try shopping locally, using the example of homeware ideas in south London. ChatGPT said to tryALKEMI, an independent lifestyle store in Nunhead. When the area was narrowed down to Herne Hill it suggested two shops: Jo’s House and Forget Me Not And Green.Trying other AI models did not appear to vary the quality of responses much. Searching on Google’s Gemini for gifts for a man who likes chess, video games, reading and music, specifically techno and house threw up these top suggestions: a book on chess strategy for £22; a £50 Bandcamp gift card; or a hot sauce tasting kit for about £30-£40.So what were the main takeaways from the exercise? AI seems to favour bigger brands (especially Amazon) unless you tell it not to. It can find you a gift, just not necessarily one that says anything more than “an algorithm picked this”. Perhaps you’ll have a bit more luck if you are willing to spend the time to steer it towards more relevant answers, but then it sort of defeats the point.Explore more on these topicsShoppingOnline shoppingChristmasRetail industryArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingConsumer affairsnewsShareReuse this content"

Its new awards celebrate the ‘teams who never get to walk a red carpet’Lauren CochraneWed 10 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 05.26 ESTShareAt the Fashion awards – a lavish event at the Royal Albert Hall this month – Jonathan Anderson was named designer of the year for a third time for his work at his own namesake brand and Dior, Anok Yai was named model of the year and Delphine Arnault, the CEO of Dior and scion of fashion’s wealthiest family, gained a special recognition award for her work supporting new talent through the LVMH prize. Think of it as fashion paying tribute to its biggest stars.Since the night, there has been praise for the British Fashion Council’s new CEO Laura Weir but also criticism. The anonymous Instagram accountboringnotcom, which often shares strong opinions on the industry, wrote: “As predicted, the same names got rotated and won the fashion awards … how utterly boring.”A week or so later, a new awards is being introduced – one where all the winners’ names might not be so well-known. Overseen by 1 Granary, a platform that focuses on helping emerging and existing fashion talent beyond those who are figureheads at brands, the Design awards aim to give credit to those behind the scenes. For every winner, 1 Granary will list the entire team involved – from junior designer to creative director.“Instead of repeating the industry’s habit of celebrating one figure at the top, we wanted awards that reflect how fashion really operates: collectively, collaboratively, and through thousands of decisions made by teams who never get to walk a red carpet,” reads the press release. As Anderson said in his acceptance speech at the Fashion awards: “I am only the show girl up here. There’s an entire team … I can’t do it without them.”View image in fullscreenOlya Kuryshchuk of 1 GranaryThere are 20 categories in the 1 Granary Design awards and winners have been voted for by other designers, including heads of brands such as Veronica Leoni at Calvin Klein and Julian Klausner at Dries Van Noten, along with people who work in the brands’ studios, with about 1,000 voting overall. Big names such as Alaïa, Phoebe Philo and Chanel have still won big, with Miu Miu picking up four awards, including best womenswear collection. But the names of the team producing that influential collectionwill now be known to 1 Granary’s 19,000 Substack subscribers.The format fits with 1 Granary’s ethos. It was set up as a student magazine by Ukrainian-born Olya Kuryshchuk with the help of other students, while studying fashion design at Central Saint Martins in 2012. Now, 13 years later, it is known for its advocacy for those in the fashion industry but out of the public eye; a mouthpiece to draw attention to problems in the work culture. Kuryshchuk and a team of six part-timers work across everything from recruitment for brands to student projects at 50 universities across the world.These awards come from a desire to set a wrong right. “We just want to follow a very simple principle, to credit the people who create the work,” says Kuryshchuk. “Architecture does it, music does it. Fashion, weirdly, is an outlier and it should not be like this.”Named after the address of the famous London fashion college, 1 Granary is now also a website, Substack and Instagram feed (with 314,000 followers). It’s read widely, well respected in the industry and, with those numbers, it’s increasingly influential. When Seán McGirr was named creative director at Alexander McQueen two years ago, meaning all of the top jobs at fashion conglomerate Kering were taken by white men,1 Granary sparked a wider debatewith anInstagram postpointing that out. More recently, they have tackled everything from the impact of AI on stylists, to the collapse of online store Ssense. In October, theypublisheda list of all the brands owed money by the retailer for their paid Substack subscribers.1 Granary was early on a wider shift in fashion towards speaking out about problems in the industry, ones that in the past might have been tolerated in order to not be seen as a troublemaker. There are now others that aren’t afraid to share opinions. The aforementioned boringnotcom Instagram account began in 2024 and is often outspoken and cutting, sometimes giving shows 0 out of 10 in their reviews. And Diet Prada, which began in 2014, still posts regularly on Instagram. The account has called out cultural appropriation andshowcased allegedly racially offensive posts by Dolce & Gabbana(the brand went on to sue the account’s founders for defamation).But Kuryshchuk is clear to make a distinction between 1 Granary and this wider landscape. “We never shame anyone,” she says. “We only talk about structural issues. We never highlight individuals or specific brands. We’re not about gossip, we’re not about stirring the pot to get likes. None of us hide our faces. We don’t publish anything we don’t stand for.” She says they have never received any legal pushback from a 1 Granary story partly because they are mindful of what they publish. “Our work is solution-oriented,” says Kuryshchuk. “If a story doesn’t help move the industry forward, we leave it.” Instead, she says, “we’re more of a community hub that advocates for [jobbing] designers.”View image in fullscreen‘The names of the team producing influential collections will now be known’ … a model on the catwalk at the latest Chanel show.Photograph: Guerin Charles/ABACA/ShutterstockDal Chodha, the leader of Central Saint Martins’ fashion communication image course, says the biggest contribution that 1 Granary has brought to the fashion landscape is exactly that: its “advocacy for those that are behind the scenes”. He describes it as “almost a union in lots of ways. Who do you go to if you work at a major design house?”For him, Kuryshchuk’s presence at international fashion weeks and contacts with teams “in every house” is pivotal. “She’s not used that to grow her own profile,” he says. “She’s used that to try to re-establish what the hell fashion is and what it looked like when she started, what it looks like today, and more critically, how we could maintain it, or maintain something, for the future.”Kuryshchuk says she is still motivated by her experience as a design student. “We all entered fashion education with a very romantic idea of the industry,” she says. “And we started discovering that the majority of graduates will never work in design, won’t get jobs.”She believes 1 Granary’s influence is starting to show. When students graduate now, “and they see that the expectations don’t match what they believed, or what is right, they are actually pushing back.” Because of its work, some quarters of the industry are wary of 1 Granary. “I think [Kuryshchuk] makes people nervous in the way that union members make people nervous,” says Chodha, “because she upsets the apple cart. There aren’t many bold voices in our industry talking about the exhausted, exploited designers who are making these collections and are locked in studios overnight.”Chodha hopes that 1 Granary can keep doing what they’re doing, supporting those within design teams, rather than “show girls” such as Anderson. Because it’s “so inside that it’s kind of an outsider, it gets to have that opportunity to be more fearless, perhaps, than a lot of others are.”Explore more on these topicsFashionFashion industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What also looks fabulous and much more grownup than it sounds is a sparkly lip, such asDior’s newRouge Dior Sequin Liquid Duos(£45). These comprise two products in one very giftable package: at one end, a liquid lipstick that becomes glittery upon application; and at the other, a gloss to either add a shiny topcoat or be worn day-to-day like any other. All the shades are wearable and flattering, but Illusionist, a cool mauvey nude, and Spectacular Nude, a warm pinky beige, go with everything.Glitter in any application will turn some of you off, and I sympathise. In which case, I would centre my party look around a deep brown lipstick or gloss. It’s less obviously festive than red, but gives the same drama and focus. There are some stunning new chocolate shades just out.Jones Road’sThe Classic Lipin Chocolate(£30), is as it sounds: a rich, creamy ganache that looks very elegant with eveningwear.

As a student, long nights would end, not infrequently, with a swim at sunrise (until, one morning, the police arrived to remind us that sharks feed at dawn). So it’s hardly surprising that, after moving to Norwich to study in my 20s, the British seaside trips I made felt tepid. Cromer, with its swathe of beige sand sloping into water an almost identical colour, seemed to suggest that over here, land and sea were really not that different from one another. That the sea as I’d known it – with all its ecstatic, annihilating energy – was an unruly part of the Earth whose existence was best disavowed.A map showing Portscatho in CornwallIt was only several years later, burnt out from a soul-destroying job, that I took a week off and boarded a train to Cornwall. I was 25, poor and suffering from the kind of gastric complaints that often accompany misery. With a pair of shorts, two T-shirts and a raincoat in my backpack, I arrived in St Ives and set off to walk the Cornish coastal path.On my second day, to my surprise, I was joined by an Iranian philosophy student I’d met at my local cafe – perhaps he was lonely and ill at ease too – and we skirted the cliffs in single file talking Hegel and subsisting almost entirely on the blackberries which burst from the verges demanding to be eaten. Beneath us, the sea shifted between being darkly rageful and a blue so pure that, if you squinted, could be the Mediterranean. By day three, we were sleeping together, and by day five, having suddenly become allergic to each other, I carried on alone.I didn’t discover Portscatho on that trip, but I did discover the pleasures of tracing the Cornish coastline on foot. Which is how, a decade later, coming round the headland of the Roseland peninsula while hulkingly pregnant, I laid eyes – in the next bay – on a group of oddly gentle-looking Georgian houses surrounding a small harbour.View image in fullscreen‘Georgian houses surround the small harbour.’Photograph: PA Images/AlamyThe feeling I had, coming into that village, reminds me of a passage in a Nabokov story,Cloud, Castle, Lake. A bachelor, who’s been forced to go on a communal holiday by the “Bureau of Pleasantrips”, unexpectedly comes upon a configuration of elements – a dark castle overlooking a lake on which a cloud is reflected in its entirety – whose particular arrangement simultaneously reveals and fulfils a longing so deeply buried in himself that, until then, he hadn’t known it existed.I love being in Portscatho when the clocks change … I’m often still on the beach at 5pm when the clear night sky brings out its waresIt was late autumn. As the narrow path dropped from the cliffs, the landscape became almost tropical: dry grasses turned into passionflowers. Crepey pink rhododendrons peered from the front gardens of the houses on the outskirts of the village. I remember the clouds that had brooded over the landscape for days suddenly clearing, giving way not to a half-hearted sunshine, but to the kind that makes you want to strip off your clothes and inhibitions and become your true self. In the village square, above a pier, off which a group of children were throwing themselves into the sea, was a pub that spilled on to the pavement, where a group of men sang sea shanties watched by people leaning against the low walls of houses over the road, sipping pints.Writers, in my experience, prefer disillusionment to transcendence. I, for one, suspected – even as it occurred – that my Cloud, Castle, Lake experience would, on repeat visits, turn out to be false: the product of novelty or pregnancy hormones. And yet, in the decade since – and not a year has passed when I’ve not gone back to Portscatho at least once – it hasn’t lost its sheen.View image in fullscreenKatharine Kilalea on the beach with her children.Photograph: Karni ArieliWhat does one picturesque seaside village, with its two pubs and its fish and chip shop, its Harbour Club hosting cover bands on Saturday nights, give that another does not? Sometimes, my love for it seems embarrassing. An indictment on my heart. As though, if I were less naive, less needing of tenderness or comfort, I’d give myself over to wilder, more difficult beaches – like Towan Beach, a mile or so further along the coast, whose crescent of empty sand resembles the beaches in New Yorker cartoons where a bearded man washes up to spend eternity eating coconuts.I love New Year, when local celebrity chef Simon Stallard cooks up a meal on the slipway and everyone gathers for the annual fireworksI should be able to enjoy a wild sea surrounded by nothing but wilderness, rather than a sea, like Portscatho’s, in which one is always a few steps from humanity and the comforts of the low-ceilingedPlume of Feathers, or a chowder cooked by local celebrity chef Simon Stallard (whose latest venture,the Standard Inn,is up the road in Gerrans). Or a grocery shop selling artisanal cheeses and New World wines. Or a gallery with paintings in the style ofGeorges Braque, instead of the bits of driftwood bric-a-brac and watercolour paintings of boats that wash up in most coastal towns. I ought to join the local wild swimming group for its daily 8am dip without needing the comforts of an espresso from a beachfront coffee bar to warm me afterwards. But, just as ghost stories are best enjoyed from a cosy chair by the fire …View image in fullscreenThe author takes a cold water dip.Photograph: Karni ArieliWhat redeems me, in my own eyes, is my preference for the winter months over the summer ones. I love being in Portscatho when the clocks change, and we’re meant to stay indoors watching whatever’s done well at the Emmys, but are often still on the beach at 5pm when the clear night sky brings out its wares. I love New Year, too, when Stallard cooks up a meal on the slipway – one year it was paella – and everyone gathers for the annual firework display.I love, best of all, the moment when, turning down the steep road into the village at the end of the long drive from London, I see the Plume, and the two roads extending from either side of it like outstretched arms towards the bay. How the sea, every time I arrive, seems to say: “Here you are, at the edge of the world, you’ve arrived at the end of the place where you’ve carried out your labours, so you can finally relax.”Katharine Kilalea is the author of OK, Mr Field, published by Faber at £8.99.To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

My best friend, Helen, and I were on our way to Blackburn to catch up with an old university friend who had recently moved there for work. Thrilled to see each other, and basking in the prospect of the party weekend ahead, we chatted nonstop as we made our way by train from York.We stashed our bags – full of essentials such as bottles of wine and my new pair of black clogs – above our heads and settled down in a cosy two-seater. About 50 minutes into our journey, I was dimly aware of a bang. Then came another, this time impossible to ignore. A woman screamed as our carriage was thrown up into the air in what felt like slow motion. Suddenly, Helen and I were somehow on our feet in the middle of the aisle, hugging each other. Head down, eyes screwed shut, I waited for the carriage to roll over and burst into flames, as I’d seen in films. I remember thinking about our families and friends getting the news. Then I heard the little girl crying.She was about seven or eight years old, and appeared to be completely on her own. Her crying shook me out of my trance; this was my opportunity to be useful. I made my way to where she was standing and put my arm around her. “You’re all right,” I whispered, my voice sounding croaky. “It’s all over,” I murmured, more to myself than her. “Don’t look round,” Helen shouted, too late. I saw a man with his face covered in blood. A huge metal object had crashed through the window behind us. Later, we learned a runaway digger had rolled down the hill and into the side of the train, causing us to derail.Our carriage was stuck with its front end in the air. Then came the noise of sirens and a fellow passenger asked me to pass the little girl to him so he could pass her through the window, where children were being evacuated to waiting firefighters. A few minutes later, Helen and I were also climbing out of the train window and scaling a ladder down on to the track.View image in fullscreen‘It is always a privilege to grow older.’Photograph: Anna WoodfordBack on terra firma – next to a goods shed in Pudsey – my body started to shake uncontrollably. I looked for the little girl and saw her being scooped up by her mum, who it turned out had been in the toilet at the time of the accident. A firefighter kindly retrieved my clogs. A fellow passenger sat down heavily on Helen’s case, causing it to burst open – though luckily our wine remained intact. After a half-hour wait, we made our way in a complimentary taxi to Blackburn, with a teenage boy and the woman who had broken Helen’s case. Our friend was waiting, ashen-faced. She knew there had been a derailment and a guard had taken her into his office and made her a cup of tea while she waited for news.With the invincibility of youth, we put the train crash to one side and carried on with our night out, which included a memorable turn by Blackburn drag queen Clitheroe Kate. No one died in the incident, although several people were taken to hospital. Helen and I escaped with bruises and aches and pains from the impact of being thrown forward in the carriage. The train had been slowing to come into Leeds station, which had been the key factor in avoiding serious injury. The fact that nobody was badly hurt made it easier not to dwell on the “what ifs” but it was the little girl who left a lasting impact on me. Taking care of her and calming her down helped take my mind off myself and taught me the value of looking outwards in a crisis. Over the years, I have often wondered if she remembered anything about it, and how big a deal it had been for her.Helen and I have now been friends for over 30 years and Pudsey has become shorthand for our ability to cope with anything, so long as we are together. Being with her that day made it feel as if I was insulated from the worst of the situation. The crash also changed the way I approach other types of crises, giving me perspective – and reminding me that, however bad things seem, it is always a privilege to grow older.Everything is Present by Anna Woodford is published by Salt Publishing.

So what is it to be this year? An ironic wreath made from brussel sprouts? Oh-so-zeitgeist decorations in the shape of Perelló olive tins or Torres crisp packets? Or are we thinking a minimalist all-white theme?Wrong, wrong and wrong again. My front door wreath – it went up two weeks ago because I’m a Christmas superfan – is huge and trad, with a tartan bow the size of a dinner plate. There are wooden nutcracker soldiers the size of toddlers by the fireplace. When I put my tree up this weekend, it may well collapse under the weight of old-fashioned round baubles.View image in fullscreenMcCallister-coded ... the poster for Oh. What. Fun.Photograph: PrimeThere has been a Christmas vibe shift: let’s call it Ho-Ho-Home Alone. After all, the first family of 2025’s holiday season are Kevin and the McCallisters, from the festive movie that is on everyone’s guilty pleasure list. Laura Jackson, co-founder of the homeware marketplace Glassette and east London’s premier tastemaker, had a pre-Christmas family sleepover at a London hotel and posted that “the kids all in their dressing gowns running down the halls felt very Home Alone”. The poster forOh. What. Fun, Michelle Pfeiffer’s new streaming-for-Christmas film, shows Pfeiffer in festive knitwear in front of a very McCallister-coded gingerbread-style suburban American mansion. The look is everywhere: we’re talking tartan pyjamas, Santa hats, stockings lined up over roaring fires. Marks & Spencer reports that candy-cane striped baubles and six packs of tinsel rosettes have been Christmas bestsellers. The vibe is cosy, but also unashamedly jolly. Forget everything you have learned about oatmeal-toned hygge chic; bring Will Ferrell in Elf levels of enthusiasm to your decorating. Let me put it this way: if you can still see your stairs, you need to drape more cedar branches around them.“Ralph Lauren Christmas” is this year’s social media phenomenon, with 5m searches racked up on TikTok even before Halloween. This sounds like a transparent commercial play by Ralph Lauren, except that the brand itself isn’t promoting the trend and has declined to comment on it. Instead, it has been named and adopted by gen Z, who have fallen hard for a vision of December that Ralph Lauren has sold for decades.View image in fullscreenSocial media phenomenon ... Ralph Lauren Christmas.Photograph: Ralph LaurenChristmas with Ralph Lauren is like a visit to an imaginary posh grandma: lots of blankets, central heating cranked up, maybe an outing to a Nutcracker matinee or ice-skating. It is sophisticated, but not in a chilly fashion-world way – and, crucially, while it feels abundant and splendid, it is not expensive to recreate. Should you be in London and fancy a refresh on the look, there are pop-up Ralph Lauren log cabins in Sloane Square until Christmas Eve, where you can take a cookie decorating class or just buy a hotdog, but the key pieces of a Ralph Lauren Christmas do not have a designer price tag. All you need is velvet ribbon tied on to everything (easy to do, cheap as chips), good lighting (nothing unites gen Z like their hatred of the big light) and a tree (fake and/or wonky works fine once you carpet it with decorations). Plump up your scatter cushions and you are good to go.I don’t actually need to spell out to you what this year’s fashionable Christmas looks like. It is basically the picture that comes into your head if you close your eyes and think of Christmas. And this is precisely the appeal. It channels nostalgia for a time that we almost remember, a rose-tinted glow-up of Christmases past that we see in family photo albums. It takes the emotional anchors of Christmas – family, sanctuary, abundance – and quite literally puts a bow on them. And it turns out, this is what all of us want. Boomers and gen X are tired of being shamed for not remembering the difference between gorpcore and goblincore. Millennials have finally grown out of everything having to be pink. Gen Z, whose popular culture has mostly centred on irony and cynicism, have suddenly discovered the importance of being earnest instead. To paraphrase Netflix: Everybody Wants This.View image in fullscreenTimeless … a woman shops for nutcracker decorations.Photograph: Oscar Wong/Getty ImagesThe vision of Christmas that tugs modern heartstrings the hardest was invented not in Victorian Britain, but in the US. The first Home Alone film came out in 1990; Ralph Lauren’s popped-collared preppy fashion ruled the decade, before streetwear came along in the 00s. Mariah Carey’s All I Want for Christmas Is You was released in 1994 and, with its glossy Coca-Cola reds and pile-it-high fairy lights, this Christmas is a version of the US timestamped not by the Maga-era culture wars but with the cheerful, have-a-nice-day mood of 90s America. In our more fractious times, the deliciously uncomplicated glamour of the era of Cindy Crawford and Steven Spielberg is what everyone wants to unwrap.In Britain, Burberry has gone big on Christmas this year. This makes sense because Burberry shares some DNA with Ralph Lauren, standing for mainstream style rather than edgy fashion, cross-generational and proudly but inclusively British in a way that mirrors Ralph Lauren’s wholesome Americana. Burberry’s chief creative officer, Daniel Lee, has decorated the 16ft tree in the lobby of Claridge’s hotel, which was unveiled at a party where Olivia Colman did a reading of ’Twas the Night After Christmas while standing beside the hotel’s grand piano. Jennifer Saunders – firmly in character as her 1990s alter ego, Ab Fab’s Edina Monsoon – stars in Burberry’s Christmas advert, hosting a festive party for friends including Naomi Campbell (this is giving 1990s, again), as well as the actor Ncuti Gatwa and the footballer Son Heung-min. The brand’s chief marketing officer, Jonathan Kiman, told the Business of Fashion website that the film “blurs the line between fantasy and a memory you feel like you’ve already lived”.View image in fullscreenGiving 90s ... Naomi Campbell in Burberry’s festive campaign.Photograph: BurberryWe can’t talk about Christmas in Britain, of course, without discussing the John Lewis advert, the release of which is basically stir-up Sunday for late-stage capitalism, so we should note thatthis year’s versionalso has a 90s heart. You’ve seen it, obviously, so you know that a teenage boy transports his dad back to the dancefloors of his youth with a copy of Alison Limerick’s 1990 track Where Love Lives. The ad has had mixed reactions from those of us old enough to feel vaguely insulted at having our misspent youths repackaged as an “aren’t-old-people-adorable” message – are 1990s house bangers the new Vera Lynn? – but in sticking the needle on a 90s record, John Lewis is right on this season’s zeitgeist. Lisa Cherry, head of Christmas at John Lewis, confirms that it is “seeing that timeless, luxurious feel reminiscent of the Home Alone or Ralph Lauren Christmas vision being picked up, with a rush on traditional elements like classic candle lights for the tree”. Cute mini knitted stockings in traditional red are also on its bauble bestseller list.Here’s the thing: joy is not beige. Christmas should not look like a conceptual art installation, or a wellness retreat for introverts. If the 90s taught us anything, it is that life is better with a soundtrack, a huge bow on everything and a healthy disregard for minimalism. So go ahead: deck your halls, your staircase, your cat. The more it looks like a Home Alone out-take, the better. Because all we really want for Christmas … is Christmas.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Photograph: Jouni Porsanger/The GuardianChristmas tourists are noticing a growing military presence in Lapland, where Santa Park doubles as a bomb shelterByMiranda Bryantin Rovaniemi. Photography by Jouni PorsangerWed 10 Dec 2025 07.39 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 13.07 ESTShareBilled as the official home town of Santa Claus, orjoulupukkias he is known inFinland, the city of Rovaniemi offers every imaginable Father Christmas-related experience – from a visit to his “office” on the Arctic Circle to reindeer sleigh rides. He even has his own branch of the Finnish design house Marimekko.But this Christmas season, in addition to the hundreds of thousands of tourists from around the world coming in search of Santa, Finnish Lapland’s snow-covered capital is becoming an increasingly popular destination for international military visitors.In recent weeks, thousands of Nato soldiers have been through Rovaniemi, which also has an airbase, for training exercises at nearby Rovajärvi, western Europe’s largest military exercise area, where they are preparing for a potential attack by Russia. Rovajärvi is about 55 miles from the Russian border.View image in fullscreenLapland Steel 25, a joint military exercise, tested the capabilities of nearly 1,000 troops from Sweden, Finland and the UK.Rovaniemi, meanwhile, is soon expected to become a key base for Finland’s Forward Land Forces (FLF) – the Swedish-ledNatobattlegroup intended to act as a deterrent on the eastern border.The increase in military activity has not gone unnoticed by Rovaniemi’s tourists.Donna Coyle and her daughter Lyla, holidaymakers from Scotland, were surprised to hear military aircraft while on reindeer safari. “We didn’t know anything about it,” said Donna.Hannah Schlicker, from Stuttgart, Germany, said it was impossible to get away from the reality of Europe at war – even in Santa’s home town.View image in fullscreenDonna Coyle and her daughter Lyla, from Scotland, said they heard military aircraft while on a reindeer safari.“This morning we took a reindeer tour and we just saw military planes going around,” she said. “We felt the presence of reality being here. You cannot hide from it.”At Santa Park, the “home cavern of Santa Claus”, which is dug into a big mound, it is difficult to ignore the fact that it doubles up as a bomb shelter for the city’s residents.Hannah said: “It’s actually scary to think about it, how close we actually are [to Russia]. But at the same time the Santa Park is a bunker … maybe it helps a little bit.”View image in fullscreenHannah and Christine Schlicker travelled from Stuttgart in Germany to Lapland. Hannah said ‘you cannot hide’ from the reality of a Europe at war.There are growing tensions between Russia and western Europe, and last week Vladimir Putin said he was“ready” for war if Europe starts itamid stalled peace talks with Ukraine. In the event of a Russian invasion, Finland’s almost 900-mile-long border with Russia – 235 miles of which is in Lapland – is thought of as one of the potential routes of attack.The Finnish military has warned that once the war in Ukraine is over, Russia is preparing to move more troops to the border with Finland, where it is in the process of building up presence and infrastructure to be a “more formidable force”.Because of its geography and history with its eastern neighbour, Finland has long been prepared for war with Russia. The obligation to participate in national defence is enshrined in its constitution. Butjoining Nato in 2023 has resulted in considerable changes, including far more international cooperation and the opening of a new north-west Nato command centre in Mikkeli, south-eastern Finland, in October.Last week, while the amusement park Santa Claus Village was full of excited children – and quite a few adults – flocking to meet Santa under falling snow, a short drive away at Rovajärvi, nearly 1,000 troops fromSweden, Finland and the UK were participating in Lapland Steel 25. The exercise was held immediately after another, Northern Strike 225, which brought more than 2,000 Finnish and Polish soldiers together to train there.MapAs part of Lapland Steel 25, which the Guardian was given access to, rifle-carrying Finnish conscripts and soldiers and Swedish soldiers manoeuvred tanks, cross-country skis and helicopters through pine forests and knee-deep snow in mock combat with one another.“We are preparing for the worst,” said a Swedish soldier and tank driver, Alva Stormark, 19. “Because we know there is a war in Europe and we are close to the Russians.”Joining the Swedish army about a year and a half ago was, she said, a “difficult decision” in light of geopolitical tensions, but she remains committed to the job. “Defending Sweden is one thing that I want to do.”View image in fullscreenCol Marko Kivelä, the commander of the Jaeger Brigade, Finland’s northernmost unit, said Lapland was of extreme strategic importance.Although Maj Mikko Kuusisto,thechief of training for the Jaeger Brigade, which is Finland’s northernmost unit, said Lapland Steel was not following a “specific scenario”, a map of the exercise showed a big red arrow coming from the north-east in the direction of Russia.He also noted that while theArcticCircle “is moving all the time”, depending on how the Earth is moving, there is no doubt that Rovaniemi is the “real” home of Santa. “Where he spends most of the time of the year is here in Rovaniemi.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So in a way this base building is something that took place in the cold war and now they are doing more or less a bit the same thing.”As a woman, the Finnish conscript Rebekka Bruun, 23, volunteered to do military service. While long marches can be gruelling – including her equipment, gun and bag, she is often carrying half her bodyweight – she does not regret signing up, despite the increasing threat of war. “I wouldn’t say ‘I wouldn’t change a day’ because I would, but I don’t regret the choice that I joined the army.”While escalating tensions on the border sometimes cross her mind, she feels prepared for potential war. “We have trained well. So I’m not nervous.”“Someone has to do it,” said Joona Lahtelin, 20, a fellow conscript standing beside Bruun. “We are mostly here of our own volition anyway, so it’s not that big of a step to join the army for real when wartime comes.”View image in fullscreenSanta Park, a Christmas-themed amusement park, doubles as a bomb shelter.Last week, representatives of the Swedish, Finnish and Norwegian armed forces met in Rovaniemi to discuss plans for the establishment of Finland’s FLF, which the city will act as a base for. The battle groups, said the Swedish army brigadier general and 1st Division commander Michael Carlén, would come from over the Swedish border in Boden, Norrbotten.FLF Finland will, he said, play an “important component of strengthening the eastern flank” of Nato. “We have a geographical area with very challenging terrain, there are few roads, there is very little infrastructure, it’s a climate that is marked in winter by very severe cold.”The international training exercises, he said, were aimed at “showing our ability and deterrence”. He added: “Violence is to be avoided with Russia by demonstrating our ability.”In a joint statement released last week [1 December], the Finnish and Swedish prime ministers, Petteri Orpo and Ulf Kristersson, said they planned to “deepen bilateral cooperation” – including across defence and civil preparedness.Explore more on these topicsFinlandRussiaNatoEuropeVladimir PutinSwedennewsShareReuse this content"

He said the military personnel had been treated well by their hosts and that plans were under way to continue the mission. On Sunday, a domestic test flight in Niger state had also crashed, with both pilots surviving.The timing of the emergency landing on Monday intensified regional scrutiny, coming a day after Nigerian airstrikes at a military camp in neighbouringBenin, where some military personnel linked to a foiled coup were reportedly in hiding.A spokesperson for the government in Abuja said Nigeria acted in line with protocols of the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), following a request from Beninese authorities after soldiers briefly seized the national broadcaster and announced the removal of the president, Patrice Talon.Omar Touray, president of the Ecowas Commission has said the region is in a state of emergency, referencing the fragility of democratic institutions and security challenges facing member states.“Events of the last few weeks have shown the imperative of serious introspection on the future of our democracy and the urgent need to invest in the security of our community,” he told the bloc’s mediation and security council during a meeting in Abuja on Tuesday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Everyone who has stolen from this country will return every last cent and be held to account.” The vice-president is a former police officer who became famous on TikTok for making alleged corruption accusations.The state broadcaster Bolivia TVpostedthat Arce was “giving a statement before” the police “while staff from the office of the ombudsman accompany him”. It noted the involvement of the Special Force to Fight Crime’s department for the investigation of illicit gains.Outside the headquarters of the FELCC in the capital, La Paz, where the former president had supposedly been taken, Tejada told journalists she was trying to enter the building to obtain more information.She said Arce “was alone” in the Sopocachi neighbourhood of La Paz, when he was allegedly “put into a minibus with blacked-out windows” and taken to the FELCC.“I’m arriving now to find out … No, there was no notification of any kind, and I’m coming to see under what procedures they brought him here,” she added.Tejada said she learned from “unofficial sources” that the reason for the detention “would be the Indigenous fund case”, referring to a government fund intended to channel part of hydrocarbon tax revenues into development projects for Indigenous peoples.During the early years of the administration of the former presidentEvo Morales, under whom Arce served as finance minister, Bolivia experienced astonishing growth, lifting thousands out of poverty – particularly many Indigenous and rural communities – thanks to a natural gas boom.The “Indigenous fund” was shut down in 2015 after a corruption scandal involving the alleged misappropriation of resources.Investigations were revived after Paz Pereira took office – the president established at least10 commissionsto audit and investigate Mas administrations, one of them focused on the “Indigenous fund”.Last Friday, the former Mas deputy Lidia Patty was also arrested by the FELCC. She is accused of having received, in her personal account, funds for the execution of projects that were never carried out.Local media reported that, in the request for Arce’s detention, the public prosecutor Miguel Ángel Cardozo alleged that when Arce was economy minister he had “violated existing regulations by authorising the transfer of public funds into personal accounts”.Explore more on these topicsBoliviaAmericasEvo MoralesnewsShareReuse this content"

Despite fevered speculation that she would make a dramatic appearance at Wednesday’s event,having somehow slipped out of Venezuela,Machado was not present, although she was expected to arrive in Oslo in the coming hours.In a lecture delivered by her daughter, Ana Corina Sosa Machado, the former congresswoman and veteran pro-democracy campaigner pledged to continue leadingVenezuelaon its “long march to freedom”.“Venezuela will breathe again,” said Machado, who has lived underground since Maduro launched a wave of repression after refusing to accept he had lost last year’s vote,despite compelling proof.View image in fullscreenAna Corina Sosa, the daughter of María Corina Machado, at the Nobel Peace Center in Oslo before the prize ceremony.Photograph: Gorm Kallestad/NTB/AFP/Getty“We will open prison doors and watch thousands who were unjustly detained step into the warm sun, embraced at last by those who never stopped fighting for them … We will hug again. Fall in love again. Hear our streets fill with laughter and music,” added Machado, who some call Venezuela’s Iron Lady.Opening Wednesday’s ceremony, the chair of the Norwegian Nobel committee, Jørgen Watne Frydnes, said Machado was “safe” and “will be here with us in Oslo” after “a journey in a situation of extreme danger”, although not in time for the event.In an audio message released by her team, the activist thanked those who had “risked their lives” to get her out of Venezuela and confirmed: “I’m on my way … I’ll see you very soon.” It was not immediately clear how Machado had managed to escape Venezuela but the Wall Street Journal, citing US officials,reportedthat she had secretly travelled by boat to the Caribbean island of Curaçao on Tuesday.Latin America leaders and celebrities including the rightwing presidents of Argentina, Ecuador, Panama and Paraguay – Javier Milei, Daniel Noboa, José Raúl Mulino and Santiago Peña – travelled to Oslo to offer Machado their support as her movement continued its crusade to force Maduro from power.Also present was Edmundo González, the 76-year-old diplomat who filled Machado’s shoes in last year’s election after she was banned from running and is widely believed to have won. González was forced into exile in Spain by Maduro’s post-election crackdown.TheVenezuelan pianist and activist Gabriela Monteroflew to Norway to perform at Wednesday’s ceremony inside the redbrick Oslo city hall.View image in fullscreenNorway’s King Harald, Queen Sonja, Crown Prince Haakon, Crown Princess Mette-Marit and Princess Ingrid Alexandra attend the Nobel peace prize ceremony in Oslo.Photograph: Leonhard Föger/ReutersMontero said Machado had asked her to playMi Querencia(My Haven), a song by the Venezuelan composer Simón Díaz that the pianist believed spoke tothe exodus of more than eight million peoplewho have fled economic hardship and repression in Venezuela since Maduro took power in 2013.“The song is about coming home,” Montero said before the ceremony. “That has been [María Corina’s] mantra all these years: that we will all be able to return home and that families will come together and the country will rebuild with that enormous diaspora that has spread through the world for so many years.”Montero paid tribute to a politician she called “the most courageous, resilient woman that I know”.“María Corina never abandoned the fight despite her enormous personal sacrifices … She always kept the goal in sight: which has been to liberate a country that she loves and that she has given her life up for,” the musician said.Addressing the audience, Frydnes celebrated Machado’s “tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a peaceful and just transition from dictatorship to democracy”.Standing next to a portrait of Machado, Frydnes sent a direct message to Maduro: “You should accept the election results and step down … because that is the will of the Venezuelan people … Let a new age dawn.”Soon after the ceremony, Colombia’s leftwing president, Gustavo Petro, also turned up the heat on Maduro, tweeting it was time for an inclusive transitional government, an end to repression and an amnesty in Venezuela.The Nobel ceremony coincides with one of the most dramatic and uncertain moments in Venezuela’s turbulent recent history. Since August, Donald Trump has ordered a massivenaval deployment in the Caribbean Sea and a series of deadly strikeson alleged narco boats off Venezuela’s northern coast.On Tuesday,two US fighter jets flew within less than 80km of Venezuela’s second biggest city, Maracaibo, in a show of force.While the official justification for the military buildup is Trump’s “war on drugs”, most analysts and diplomats believe his fundamental goal is to topple Maduro by sparking a military uprising. Trump tried – but failed – to remove Maduro during his first term in the White House with a “maximum pressure” campaign of sanctions and military threats.“His days are numbered,” Trump told Politico this week – although allies, including the now secretary of state Marco Rubio, madealmost identical claimsduring the 2019 attempt to unseat Maduro, and were wrong.Speaking to Politico, Trump refused to rule out a ground invasion of Venezuela, although given his non-interventionist policy few expect that to happen. Still, some observers fear bloodshed if Trump intensifies his military campaign, possibly by launching strikes against land targets within Venezuela.Celso Amorim, the chief foreign policy adviser to Brazil’s leftwing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva,told the Guardian that a US attack could create a Vietnam-style “war zone”.Other observers remember the chaos unleashed by the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 to overthrow Saddam Hussein or the 2011 Nato airstrikes that helped bring down Muammar Gaddafi.Montero rejected such comparisons. “They try to compare it to other ‘regime changes’ in history – and it’s nothing like anything else that we have ever seen,” the pianist said.View image in fullscreenCorina Parisca de Machado, the mother of María Corina Machado, arrives at Oslo city hall before the award ceremony.Photograph: Ole Berg-Rusten/EPA“We have marched, we have voted, we have protested [against Maduro] … We’ve done everything to free ourselves of this terrible, terrible chapter of our history … and it’s very frustrating when we encounter public opinion that doesn’t understand what has happened to us and what we are up against.”In her lecture, Machado said Venezuela had once been “the most stable [democracy] in Latin America” but had been plunged into economic ruin and authoritarian rule in the years after the 1998 election of Maduro’s mentor, Hugo Chávez, as the country’s oil wealth was frittered away and stolen. “From 1999 onward, the regime dismantled our democracy,” she said. “[We have spent] almost three decades … fighting against a brutal dictatorship.”The Norwegian Nobel Institute’s decision to honour Machado is not without controversy. While the committeecelebratedher dogged struggle against Venezuela’s “brutal, authoritarian state”, critics pointed to Machado’s past support for military intervention to unseat the country’s dictator. Others have criticised her failure to condemn Trump’s deadly strikes in the Caribbean orhis treatment of Venezuelan migrantsdeported to a notorious prison in El Salvador. After her Nobel prize was announced in October, Machado dedicated the award to Trump “for his decisive support of our cause” and called the US president one of “our main allies to achieve freedom and democracy”.Dozens of protesters took to the streets of Oslo on the eve of the ceremony to denounce the award.“A peace prize must be awarded to actors who genuinely work for peace, dialogue, and justice. When the prize is given to a politician who supports military interference and actions contrary to international law, it breaks with the very purpose of theNobel peace prize,” Gro Standnes, an activist and member of the Norwegian Peace Council said in a statement.Explore more on these topicsMaría Corina MachadoNobel peace prizeVenezuelaAmericasNorwayEuropeNicolás MaduronewsShareReuse this content"

Here is a summary of the key developments from today:Donald Trump delivered a more than 90-minute, rambling, campaign-style address broadly focused on “affordability” to a rally of supporters in Pennsylvania today.The speech marked the first of several the president is expected to deliver in a slate of domestic appearances he said his chief of staff Susie Wiles encouraged him to give ahead of the 2026 midterms.Two American fighter jets flew over the Gulf ofVenezuelathe same day that Trump administration officials briefed the “gang of eight” on ongoing military strikes on boats in the Caribbean.Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries called the briefing “very unsatisfying” and called for the “full video” of the “double tap” strike on a suspected drug-trafficking boat be released.Miami elected its first Democratic mayor in nearly 30 years.County commissioner Eileen Higgins defeated investment manager Emilio Gonzales, who was endorsed byDonald Trump. Higgins’ victory in the Latino majority city comes as Latino and Hispanic voters increasingly disapprove of Trump.More than 200 former employees in the justice department’s civil rights divisionsigned a letterreleased on Tuesday decrying the “near destruction” of the agency that is supposed to enforce America’s civil rights laws.They accused political leadership of waging a campaign to purge career experts from its ranks.A federal judge in New York hasgrantedthe justice department’s request to unseal grand jury documents in the sex-trafficking case against Ghislaine Maxwell – the companion and accomplice of the late sex-offender Jeffrey Epstein.It comes after the passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which Trump signed last month.Bill Cassidy, the Republican who chairs the Senate health committee, pushed back against the recent decision from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to limit the hepatitis B vaccine.“We should be informed by medical science and empiricism, not by personal prejudice. And right now with ACIP, I see far more being informed by a personal prejudice,” he said.In aninterview with Politico published on Tuesday morning, Trump said defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, should testify under oath before Congress abouta “double tap” strike on an alleged drug-ferrying boat“if he wants”.He added: “I don’t care. I would say do it if you want, Pete.”ShareUpdated at21.46 EST"

The director describes capturing their boats getting rammed by the Chinese coast guardWed 10 Dec 2025 09.47 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 11.41 ESTShareDuring a televised debate in 2016, populist presidential candidate Rodrigo Duterte made a typically belligerent statement that he himself would jetski to Scarborough Shoal in the SouthChinaSea and plant a Philippine flag there. Duterte claimed that he was ready to die a hero to keep the Chinese out of the bitterly contested maritime territory.“That made millions of Filipino workers and fishers vote for him because of that one promise,” says film-maker Baby Ruth Villarama. As her new Oscar and Bafta-contending documentaryFood Delivery: Fresh from the West Philippine Seareveals, it wasn’t a promise Duterte kept. “He would make excuses that the jetski has broken down. Eventually there was an official pronouncement that it had just been a campaign joke. From then on, the fisherfolk were really enraged.”In her film, Villarama follows the fishers as they traverse what they call the West Philippine Sea, which thePhilippinesregards as part of its exclusive economic zone. She spent 60 days filming them, as well as recording the work of the soldiers who supply local islands with food. It’s a tough and dangerous existence that has been made even more difficult by continuous harassment from the Chinese coast guard.Food Delivery has beautiful underwater photography and footage of bird colonies as Villarama patiently chronicles the everyday problems faced by the fishers and soldiers. They’re away from their families for long stretches; they have bills to pay; and when he is back on shore one of the main protagonists is shown undergoing tests for prostate cancer. It is in many ways an observational, human interest documentary about life at sea. Nonetheless, since completing the project in March, Villarama has found herself caught in the crosshairs of the Chinese government.View image in fullscreen‘Working in quiet dignity’ … Food Delivery: Fresh from the West Philippine Sea.Photograph: Voyage StudiosFood Delivery was suddenly pulled from the programme of the Philippines’ CinePanalo film festival two days before its world premiere. The reason became apparent when it was subsequently selected for the Doc Edge festival in New Zealand, whose organisers received a formal request from the Chinese Consulate-General in Auckland not to screen the movie. The Consulate-General’s letter,published by the festival,saidthe film was “rife with disinformation and false propaganda, serving as a political tool for the Philippines to pursue illegitimate claims in the South China Sea.”Villarama says the harassment of the fishers “cannot go on”. “The bullying, and boats being chased every week. If we are to live in a stable society, we have to respect certain boundaries. This 200-mile exclusive economic zone is a gift to every country. The UK has it, the US has it, the Philippines has it.”Food Delivery: Fresh from the West Philippine Sea review – gripping trip along supply lines in China standoffRead moreA certain strained civility still exists between the Chinese and the Philippines coast guards. This is a campaign of harassment that can include ramming and the cutting of ropes but both sides try to steer clear of outright physical violence. Villarama and her camera crew were themselves on board a ship that got rammed by the Chinese coast guard. She expresses her relief that the ship didn’t sink: “I am not a good swimmer. I can float – but I am not a good swimmer.”Villarama previously worked as a stringer for Reuters and as a TV journalist and her 2016 documentary Sunday Beauty Queen explored the plight of Philippine foreign workers looking for escape from their lives of underpaid drudgery by taking part in beauty pageants.Now, though, the stakes are high. It’s not just about the livelihoods of those working in the fishing industry – national food security is at risk. “I did not ask for this personally. Who would want to make a film that would go against a superpower like China? But where I was presented with the truth, the lived experience of our fisherfolk, the very people who are working in quiet dignity, and when I realised there are actual threats to our freedom and our food security, we had no choice but to embrace the story.”Explore more on these topicsFilmPhilippinesChinaDocumentary filmsAsia PacificFishing industrynewsShareReuse this content"

More than 500,000 people have fled their homes to safety in Thailand and Cambodia since the start of the reignited conflict.Both sides have accused each other of violating a US-backed ceasefire deal brokered by Trump in July andsigned in his presencesix weeks ago.Tensions have simmered since Thailand suspended de-escalation measures in November after a Thai soldier was maimed by a landmine that Bangkok said was newly laid by Cambodia, a claim that Cambodia denies.What’s behind the Thailand-Cambodia clashes – explained in 30 secondsRead moreIn a sign that neither side was willing to back down, Thai prime minister Anutin Charnvirakul said on Tuesday that Cambodia had not yet contacted Thailand about possible negotiations and the fighting would continue.“We’ve got to do what we’ve got to do,” he said. “The government will support all kinds of military operations as planned earlier.” Earlier this week he said that military action was necessary to safeguard the nation’s sovereignty and ensure public safety.In a statement posted to Facebook and Telegram, Cambodia’s senate president and former longtime prime minister Hun Sen claimed that his country had refrained from retaliating Monday, but overnight began to fire back at Thai forces.“Cambodia wants peace, but Cambodia is forced to fight back to defend its territory,” Hun Sen wrote.As of Tuesday night, Cambodia’s defence ministry said nine civilians had been killed since Monday and 20 seriously injured, while Thai officials said four soldiers had been killed and 68 had been injured.With Reuters and Associated PressExplore more on these topicsThailandCambodiaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Prosecutors also have a very high conviction rate.Known for his Tony-nominated Slave Play, Harris was detained at Naha airport on 16 November when customs officers allegedly found 0.78 grams (0.028 ounces) of a substance containing the stimulant MDMA in the 36-year-old’s carry-on tote bag.“He was released on December 8 while we sent the case to the Naha District Public Prosecutors Office,” the Okinawa police official Tetsuya Shimoji said.A spokesperson for the Tomishiro police station in Okinawa’s Tomigusuku City declined to say whether Harris had been chargedwhen contacted by the New York Timeson Tuesday. A spokesperson for the prosecutors office also declined to comment to AFP on the case.It was unclear whether Harris was allowed to leave Japan while the probe continues. A representative for Harris told the New York Times that he had been released without charges, and that he would stay in Japan to write and research for an upcoming project.Harris arrived in the southern Okinawa region on a flight from Taiwan, where he had a layover after flying from Britain, according to local broadcaster RBC.He came to Japan for tourism, the broadcaster said.Slave Play earned a record-breaking 12 Tony nominations in 2018, but did not win any awards.Harris also serves as a co-producer of HBO’s popular series Euphoria.Explore more on these topicsJeremy O HarrisJapanDrugsAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Yet he has now become the first person in his family to complete year 12.“I didn’t think it would happen,” the 17-year-old says. “I didn’t think I’d be finishing year 12.”Bundle-Bell is among more than 65,000 Victorian students who will graduate with their Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) on Thursday.At the same time, Victorian students will become the first in the country to receive their Australian Tertiary Admission Rankings (Atar) scores, with the remaining states and territories to follow next week.The Australian school spearheading an Indigenous language revivalRead moreBundle-Bell, a Gunditjmara and Butchulla man, is the first in his family to complete year 12 after he undertook the vocational major program at Braybrook Secondary College in Melbourne’s west. The program is a practical and alternative pathway for students to secure a high school certificate.While the cohort does not receive an Atar score, they do receive their VCE and a statement of results.They account for 9,777 of the record 65,586 students graduating with their VCEs this year, according to the state government.More than 15,300 students received at least one study score of 40 or higher, while 664 students have received at least one maximum study score of 50.Additionally, more than 1,150 students received the Victorian Pathways Certificate, which prepared students for future studies or entry into the workforce.‘I’m a practical person’Bundle-Bell says, despite considering leaving school, he stuck it out for two more years to complete his VCE – and feels “very satisfied and glad with myself”.He opted for the vocational pathway because of its hands-on approach.“I’m a practical person. I learn better that way. I see something, do something – rather than being told what to do,” he says.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailDuring a work-experience stint with the Eastern Maar Aboriginal Corporation, he took part in horticulture activities, which sparked an interest in further study. He will begin an apprenticeship in horticulture in the new year.“It will be good to learn new stuff and be outdoors.

By convening a ministry meeting, interstate ministers attending the fundraiser would be able to claim their flights as an expense.Politicians embroiled in the growing expenses scandal –including Wells, Albanese, Don Farrell and others– have defended theiruse of the family travel rulesto bring their spouses and children to events such as the Australian Open and major NRL and AFL matches, saying it was within the rules.The IPEA is the parliament’s expenses oversight body. It is governed by the IPEA Act and associated regulations.Guardian Australia can reveal an explanatory document about the regulations says spousal travel for senior office holders is “relevantly unlimited in respect of total expenses claimable each year”.Backbenchers are allowed the equivalent of nine business-class trips between their home city and Canberra, as well as three economy-equivalent trips to other locations in Australia.Anika Wells’ expenses are within the rules but even many politicians know these perks should be wound backRead moreBut senior office holders – including government ministers, the Senate president, the House of Representatives speaker, the opposition leader and deputy opposition leader – are allowed to bring their spouses almost anywhere, with no cap on costs.Spouses can travel with or even without a minister if they have been invited to an “engagement” in their “capacity as the spouse of a senior office holder”.Guardian Australia has asked legal and transparency experts, as well as former senior politicians, about those rules.Transparency International Australia’s chief executive, Clancy Moore, said while the generous entitlements are within the rules, public confidence in the way politicians spend depends on both compliance and perception.“Taxpayer-funded business-class flights for a minister’s spouse to attend major sporting events, a helicopter trip to aLiberal partyfundraiser, or the current deputy prime minister’s extensive use of RAAF flights to Avalon airport all highlight the gap between what’s allowed and community expectations,” he said.“There’s a broader pattern of behaviour by some federal MPs where weak oversight of lobbying, secret cash-for-access meetings with donors and ministers sneaking off to industry lobbying jobs upon leaving politics weakens people’s trust in our democracy.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They’ll have a look at that – that’s appropriate.”Wells conceded that the amount of spending on entitlements “prompt a gut reaction in people” but maintained she believed she had not breached guidelines.“These rules were made under the previous government. I have abided by the rules the whole time I’ve been a parliamentarian,” she said.The shadow minister Melissa McIntosh – who herself came under fire after revelationsshe claimed $429.64 in 2021 to take family to the Bathurst 1000 car race– said family travel entitlements should be reformed.“I think possibly [rules around entitlements] could be dropped,” she told Channel Nine. “I think their public expectations of politicians have changed over the years and we do all want to be with our families, me included. I have three children. But if we don’t drop this, then we need to really restrict it.”McIntosh claimed Wells’ use of the entitlements were “not just [a] family reunion, this is rorting the system”.The independent MP Monique Ryan said it was important to support politicians forced to leave their young families for work but that rules needed to meet public expectations.“In a cost-of-living crisis, politicians have to be careful to ensure that their arrangements are sensitive to the need to spend public funds responsibly,” she said. “Given the repeated concerns around these issues, it makes sense for the government to review the travel allowance regulations.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicians' expensesAustralian politicsAnthony AlbaneseLabor partyLiberal partynewsShareReuse this content"

But as one ally says, quoting Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa’s seminal 1860s novel The Leopard: “If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change.”It was that sentiment that convinced Lammy’s predecessor,Shabana Mahmood, now home secretary, that the UK should join the push to seek a declaration to change how the European convention of human rights should be interpreted.It was Mahmood who made the determined argument from inside government thatLabourmust act to prevent the perceived overreach of human rights law or risk far worse if they lose the next election to the hard right.And it is that message – reform or die – that has won over a considerable number of Labour MPs, including Lammy, a veteran of the struggle for racial justice and Hermer, one of the most eminent human rights barristers of his generation, who were once considered sceptics of that mission.11:40Will weakening human rights really stop the far right? | The LatestFor many, it will be jarring to see how the UK has come to argue alongside countries like Hungary and Italy that the ECHR must advise domestic judges that they should narrow the definition of “inhuman and degrading treatment” as well as put curbs on the right to family life.But Lammy and Hermer are in Strasbourg alongside others on the centre-left inEurope– Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Ireland – because of their view that the only way now to salvage the ECHR is to change how it can be applied.Ministers believe the UK can be a particularly influential voice in the debate. Under Keir Starmer, another former human rights lawyer, there is no question of the UK leaving the convention itself. That matter is not up for discussion.But the UK wants to be able to demonstrate quickly that national interest can be served and the public protected while remaining a member of the ECHR.Since this autumn, the argument has become even more acute, with the Conservatives also now committed to leaving the ECHR, alongside Reform UK which has long made that argument.Starmer himself,who wrote his first article for the Guardianin 2009 in defence of human rights law, is convinced that there are genuine instances of the convention being interpreted too widely, especially by the lower tribunal.Too often, those are caricatures in the rightwing press, myths about how foreign judges won’t let criminals be deported because their children prefer the taste of British chicken nuggets.But there have been more serious cases in recent years that have worried ministers, ofchild rapists permitted to stay in the UKbecause of the overcrowded nature of Brazilian prisons or some instances where healthcare systems not deemed as advanced in other countries have prevented the deportation of criminals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThis, ministers say, is their target for narrowing the interpretation of the law, not preventing genuine survivors of torture from claiming asylum.In almost every case – despite what Nigel Farage or Robert Jenrick say – it is not actually judgments from Strasbourg causing the issue but the way that domestic immigration tribunals have been interpreting the convention.What the UK and its 27 allies are seeking is a spring declaration from the ECHR that sets out stricter ways that domestic courts should interpret family life and degrading treatment.Taken together, ministers hope those changes will see far fewer cases of dangerous individuals having their deportations prevented by the courts – and thus less ammo for the far right to use.The counter argument, which many charities and campaigners have made, is that the answer to the far-right challenge to human rights law is not to try to appease them, but to defend the principle more robustly.Unless Starmer is also prepared to be more vocal on that principle, there is a real risk that actions he hopes will help preserve human rights will alienate even more of his progressive voters and do little to convince anti-immigration voters on the right he has gone far enough.Explore more on these topicsEuropean court of human rightsHuman rightsLabourDavid LammyRichard HermerShabana MahmoodEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

And we said, before we go to a meeting, we want to know some things,” Trump said. “They would like us to go to a meeting over the weekend in Europe, and we’ll make a determination depending on what they come back with. We don’t want to be wasting time”.A British readout of the call said that all leaders agreed it was a “critical moment” and “intensive work on the peace plan is continuing and will continue in the coming days.”Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, will be on Thursday’s call, along with Starmer, Macron and Merz, whohad a meeting in Downing Street on Monday. They will be joined by numerous other leaders of nations supporting Ukraine.Zelenskyy, was expected to hand over a revised version of a peace plan to US negotiators on Wednesday before the call with leaders and officials from about 30 countries.“This week may bring news for all of us,” Zelenskyywroteon X. “We believe that peace has no alternative, and the key questions are how to compel Russia to stop the killings and what specifically will deter Russia from a third invasion.The European leaders have also been working to draw up security guarantees forUkrainein the event a peace deal is struck, though it is far from clear any western nations are willing to offer meaningful guarantees against further Russian aggression in the event of a peace deal.‘He served with honour’: Starmer pays tribute to British soldier killed in UkraineRead moreTrump has vacillated between appearing supportive and dismissive of Ukraine since taking office at the beginning of this year, but hisrecent peace drive on terms that seem beneficial to Russia, combined witha new US national security strategy that attacks European nations, has worried allies. In a repeat of previous cycles of Trump-led peace efforts, Zelenskyy has mobilised European leaders to come to his assistance when under pressure from the US president.Trump claimed earlier in the week that Zelenskyy had not even read his draft peace plan. “Russia is, I believe, fine with it, but I’m not sure that Zelenskyy is fine with it,” said Trump.Numerous Russian officials have praised the Trump team’s peace efforts, and Vladimir Putin welcomed the White House envoys Steve Witkoff andJared Kushnerfor five hours of talks in the Kremlin last week. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Trump was the only western leader with “an understanding of the reasons that made war in Ukraine inevitable”.But sceptics say there is little sign that Russia is ready to sign a peace deal, even on the terms proposed by the White House, which include Kyiv giving up control ofthe entire Donbas region. Putin has instead said repeatedly that Moscow wants a “comprehensive settlement” to the conflict.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But clearly feeling pressured by statements from Trump and others in his orbit, Zelenskyy said on Tuesday evening he was “ready for elections”. He said he would ask the US to supply proposals on how to hold a vote safely and request that MPs prepare legislation to allow an election.“I am asking … the United States to help me, possibly together with European colleagues, to ensure security for the elections, and then in the next 60 to 90 days Ukraine will be ready to hold the elections. I personally have the will and readiness for this,” Zelenskyy said.On the frontline, Russia continued its assaults on the city of Pokrovsk and nearby Myrnohrad on Wednesday. The Ukrainian military said Russia was using “armoured vehicles, cars and motorcycles” to storm the northern part of Pokrovsk from the morning. Russia has already claimed control of the whole city but Kyiv says it holds the northern part.On Tuesday, Russia’s top general, Valery Gerasimov, said Moscow’s forces now controlled 30% of nearby Myrnohrad and that Putin had ordered them to complete the takeover of the town. A Ukrainian military source who had just returned from Myrnohrad confirmed that street battles are going on in the town. “It’s absolute hell,” said the source.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeKeir StarmerVolodymyr ZelenskyyFriedrich MerzEmmanuel MacronRussianewsShareReuse this content"

The school will never open because of lack of demand, forcing the DfE to pull the plug late last year.Instead the DfE agreed with Nottingham city council to convert the building into a special school, as a satellite to the existing Rosehill special school, to provide more places for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send).A regional breakdown shows in London £55m was spent on eight free schools that closed or were “rebrokered”, where a school is moved from one academy trust to another. In the West Midlands, £16m was spent on two failed free schools, while 57 existing schools in the region were listed under the DfE’s rebuilding programme.Gove’s free schools increase segregation and harm nearby schools, says studyRead moreMeg Powell-Chandler, director of theNew Schools Network, argued that the programme had “injected new energy” into England’s school system, allowing fresh thinking and innovations by teachers and leaders.Powell-Chandler said: “Free schools now outperform other non-selective state schools from the phonics check to A-levels, raising standards, increasing choice and improving outcomes for hundreds of thousands of pupils.“We urge the government to move forward with the 44 mainstream projects that would transform education in many left-behind areas, as well as the stalled special and alternative provision schools needed to provide vital, high quality specialist places.”In October last year Bridget Phillipson announced thatplanning for the 44 schoolsapproved under the programme would be paused while the government carried out an evaluation of their value for money. A decision on their fate is expected soon.Explore more on these topicsFree schoolsDepartment for EducationSchool fundingSchoolsSchool building programmeAcademiesEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

We want to end the use of B&Bs by the end of the parliament.“It will take people having access to better temporary accommodation, increased social housing and so on. But I think we can do it. If we don’t manage it, no one will judge me as harshly as I’ll judge myself.”She said the latest figures from Shelter, which show that more than 380,000 people in England are now homeless, with a record 350,000 in temporary accommodation, demonstrate the scale of the challenge facing the government.“We’ve had people’s incomes being constrained and costs going up, and then austerity for town halls over the past decade and a half,” she said. “When the force and momentum of those three big challenges is so great, it’s going to take more than a year of a Labour government to turn that around – but we will.”Even as she launched the strategy, her government came under fire from campaigners and the Labour mayor for Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, for freezing housing benefit until at least 2026.Burnham told ITV News on Wednesday: “The Westminster world, because sometimes they pose as tough on benefits, [says]: ‘Let’s freeze local housing allowance.’“All that means is families in private rented accommodation see a growing gap between the rent that being has to pay and the level of support they’re getting from the system, and it gets bigger to the point where they’re made homeless and they have to present to the council.”Sarah Elliott, the chief executive of Shelter, said: “The failure to unfreeze local housing allowance rates will condemn thousands to another grim winter without a secure home. Even more people will find it impossible to either avoid or escape homelessness in the months ahead unless the government throws them a lifeline.”McGovern hit back however: “The root of this problem is not housing allowance, it is the private rented sector.“If we want to move forward on this issue, we have to get to the root cause of it, and that means building more homes and making sure that people have got sustainable incomes.”As part of the government’s homelessness strategy, ministers have pledged hundreds of millions of pounds to various schemes to improve temporary accommodation, including a £124m fund for more supported housing for people with complex needs.The cornerstone of the strategy is a proposed “duty to collaborate” law that would force public bodies to work together to ensure people are not released from prison or discharged from hospital on to the streets.It would for the first time set clear targets on this issue, including halving the number of people who become homeless on their first night out of prison, and ensuring no eligible person is discharged to the street after a hospital stay.But ministers have refused to raise housing benefit – something campaigners say is essential to reduce homelessness in the short term.Jasmine Basran, the head of policy and campaigns at the charity Crisis, said its research showed homelessness among people discharged from hospitals, prisons and other institutions had increased by 22% in the last year.“We see people who have been in hospital and still have medical needs, but are discharged on to the streets, and then have to deal with the trauma and dangers of rough sleeping on top of physical and mental health conditions that they simply can’t manage,” she said.“It is not a place to recover. It just means we see people cycling back into A&E because they haven’t got the care they need. And if you are homeless once you leave prison, you are much more likely to reoffend. So this approach is absolutely right.”David Robinson, the assistant director of operations at the housing association Riverside, said: “This is something we see all the time – lots of the people we help have previously been in prison, hospital or social care, and left the system without anywhere to go.“But the devil is in the detail and we need to know who is going to have to do this, what the timescale is, and what resources will be there to support them.”Explore more on these topicsHomelessnessHousingSocial exclusionPovertyLabourCommunitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

We continue to be more efficient and absorb increasing costs where possible”.Toffee Crisp was created in 1963 by John Henderson, the great-nephew of the man known as the toffee king John Mackintosh.Blue Riband, which draws its name from the prestigious transatlantic liner award, was launched in 1936 by Gray Dunn & Co in Scotland, a subsidiary of Rowntree’s, later becoming part of Nestlé in 1988.The cost of chocolate has increased sharply as cocoa prices have soared after poor harvests in the key growing regions of Ghana and Ivory Coast over the past three years, amid extreme temperatures and unusual rainfall patterns driven by the climate crisis.In October, McVitie’s reduced the amount of cocoa in the recipes of Club and Penguin bars so much they are now only “chocolate flavour” after parent company Pladis chose to use cheaper alternatives to the main ingredient in chocolate.Chocolate pricesin Britain rose 18.4%compared with last year, analysts at the market research firm Worldpanel said on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsChocolateFoodNestléFood & drink industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The state’s supreme court affirmed the judge’s findings in late 2024. But state lawmakers have since violated her ruling, enshrining new laws this year that contradict it, argue 13 of the 16 plaintiffs in a petition filed on Wednesday.“These new policies mean the state is going to just continue to act in a way that will increase greenhouse gasses which during the Held case were shown to be disproportionately harming youth,” said Rikki Held, the 24-year-old lead petitioner who was also the named plaintiff in the earlier lawsuit. “It means we’ll continue down a path we already know and have proven is detrimental.”The Held decision stated that state laws limiting state agencies’ ability to consider greenhouse gas emissions and climate impacts during environmental reviews are unconstitutional. It also said that though the climate crisis is a global issue, Montana bears responsibility to address the harms that are being caused by greenhouse gas emissions within the state.“The decision confirmed that laws which put blinders on agencies during environmental reviews are unconstitutional,” said Nate Bellinger, supervising staff attorney at Our Children’s Trust, the non-profit law firm that filed the petition in Held v Montana. “But now the state is essentially re-blindering agencies.”During the 2025 Montana legislative session, the new challenge says, elected leaders passed a law prohibiting the state from adopting air quality standards more stringent than those incorporated in the federal Clean Air Act. It’s a “complete inversion” where the federal standards will serve as a cap on regulation instead of a floor, Bellinger said.The legislature also amended the state’s Environmental Policy Act, naming just six climate warming gases for the state to inventory while conducting environmental reviews of energy projects. It also dictated that upstream and downstream emissions – or those resulting from transporting fossil fuels or out-of-state combustion of the fuels produced in Montana – should not be incorporated in the analysis, even though agencies used to consider these impacts.In an “even more egregious” provision, said Bellinger, lawmakers explicitly barred state agencies from using the resulting information about pollution to condition or deny permits for those proposals.“Those provisions are unconstitutional,” Bellinger said.The petition names the state of Montana, as well as its governor, Greg Gianforte, and the department of environmental quality, as defendants. The agency declined to comment on the challenge. The state of Montana was not immediately available for comment.Lawmakers behind the new policies made it “pretty clear” that their proposals were a response to the youth challengers’ 2023 victory, said Bellinger. Late last year, the incoming state senate president and house speaker even issued a joint statementtelling the court to “buckle up”for the following session.In the new petition, challengers are asking Montana’s supreme court to strike down these new laws. They say that is a necessary step to ensure the state is upholding duties laid out in its constitution, which guarantees the right to a “clean and healthful environment”.The challenge comes amid an assault on climate and environmental regulations from the Trump administration. Those attacks make it all the more important for states to protect their citizens, said the youth activist Held.“It’s a time when we really should be seeing more action from our government on greenhouse gas emissions,” said Held.Montana has moved in the opposite direction, said Bellinger, with the state’s governor creating a taskforce to provide recommendations to “unleash” fossil fuel output, echoing an executive order Trumpsigned in January. State officials areactivelyevaluatingproposals to expand coal, oil and gas in compliance with Trump’s pro-fossil fuel agenda, he said.“We need to get these laws off the books as quick as possible so they can have all the tools they need before them to deny those permits and not feel like they have to approve,” Bellinger said.Held says she has directly felt the impacts of the climate crisis, caused primarily by the burning of fossil fuels. On her family’s ranch where she grew up, drought has taken a toll on the health of livestock and crops, while extreme weather limited her ability to spend time outside. Between the filing of Held v Montana in 2020 and plaintiffs’ victory in the case three years later, global warming became worse, she said.“We don’t have another five years to wait for protections while the state keeps using fossil fuels,” she said. “This is really urgent.”Explore more on these topicsMontanaDemocracy and justiceFossil fuelsChildrenUS justice systemnewsShareReuse this content"

SO EXCITING! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent,” Trumpwroteon Wednesday on social media.An official governmentwebpagepromises US residency “in record time” with the new “Trump Gold Card” – once applicants have paid a $15,000 processing fee to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), passed a background check and paid up $1m.Per a Septemberexecutive order, individuals are required to pay $1m, while businesses sponsoring employees are required to pay $2m. Firms then need to pay a 1% annual maintenance fee of $20,000, and a 5% transfer fee of $100,000 each time they want to switch the visa from one employee to another.The program comes as the Trump administration devotes significant resources to deporting millions of undocumented immigrants. The gold card program has already faced heavy criticism by seemingly contradicting the US’s traditional reputation as a refuge for the hardworking poor.A “Trump Platinum Card” is also “coming soon”, according to the official website. This card will allow holders to spend up to 270 days in the US without being subject to US taxes on non-US income. It will cost $5m.According to Trump, proceeds from the new program will go to “an account where we can do things positive for the country” and that it will generate “many billions of dollars”.Trump signed an executive order in September announcing the official launch of the gold card. When the program was first reported in February, the price for a visa was $5m. The discounted price tag may give the card a competitive edge compared with similar “pay to jump the line” programs in other countries. For example, New Zealand’snew golden visaprogram costs nearly $3m (US dollars), but managed to attract strong interest from wealthy Americans following Trump’s re-election.“Essentially, we’re having people come in, people that, in many cases, I guess, are very successful or whatever,” the president said back in September. “They’re going to spend a lot of money to come in. They’re going to pay, as opposed to walking over the borders.”DHS secretary Kristi Noempraisedthe program on X, saying “under this historic initiative, qualified individuals and corporations, who contribute $1 million and $2 million respectively, will receive expedited EB-1 or EB-2 green cards following rigorous vetting”.Explore more on these topicsUS newsUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

But the nine-to-three vote to lower rates to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%was divisive among the committee that tends to vote in unanimity.The split highlights the overalluncertainty within the Fedas the US economy absorbs major economic shakeups, including tariffs, changes to the labor force from Trump’s immigration crackdown and massive government cuts.Making matters harder for Fed officials is the lack of comprehensive price and labor market data, the collection of which was halted during the government shutdown. And Trump is weighing his choice for replacing the Fed’s chair.The latest economic data has shown slight increases to both inflation, which went from 2.3% in April to 3% in September, and unemployment, which went from 4% in January to 4.4% in September.The dual increases, while relatively small, put the Fed in a tough spot. Keeping rates too high could stall the economy, but bringing rates down too quickly could mean higher inflation.New projections from officials suggest hesitance to cut rates further next year, a refusal that could further rifts between the Fed and the White House. In a press conference on Wednesday, Powell said the Fed was trying to balance “significant downside risks” in the jobs market with inflationary pressures from Trump’s tariffs that are “pretty clear to see”.Powell repeatedly said official figures were likely currently overestimating the strength of job creation in the US. He said officials will “need to be careful” in assessing economic data that will be released over the coming weeks on prices and the labor market due to the impact of the government shutdown on data collection.“Data was not collected in October and half of November, so we are going to get data, but we are going to have to look at it carefully and with a somewhat skeptical eye,” he said.Earlier in the year, Fed officials said they were waiting to see how Donald Trump’s tariffs would impact prices before making any changes to interest rates, pausing a rate cutting campaign that had started last fall.For months, Trump and his allies in the White House have publicly attacked Fed officials – typically, US presidents respect the nonpartisan nature of the central bank – for not lowering interest rates. Even with rising inflation, Trump has continued toinsistthat any price increases are holdovers from Joe Biden’s presidency, despite some corporate leaders saying that their price increases are directly attributed to tariffs.Next year, Powell’s term as chair will be up in May, leaving room for Trump to nominate his pick for the most influential economic role in the country. Trump has suggested Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, could be his nominee, though it is unclear how popular Hassett is among other Republicans.Hassett told Fox News on Wednesday that Trump will befinalizing his choice within the next few weeks.Asked about his legacy, Powell said: “My legacy? My thought is that I really want to turn this job over to whoever replaces me with the economy in really good shape.”Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveUS economyJerome PowellDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

This latest reporting portrays a pattern of pay-to-play donations and favorable actions by the administration,” said Jeff Merkley, senator for Oregon and senior member of the Senate appropriations and budget committees.“The timing of the stock trades certainly merits investigation for potential conflicts of interest and insider trading.”The Guardian reported the unusual share-buying spree by the billionaire Republican donors, who took the company public three days after Trump’s inauguration in January.In response to the findings, a spokesperson for Venture Global said the share acquisitions “fully complied with SEC rules and regulations” and the company “strictly adhered to all laws, rules and regulations relating to our interactions with government officials”.Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said: “The president has never engaged, and will never engage, in conflicts of interest.”Sabel was among about 20 people who attended an event in April 2024 atTrump’s private club, Mar-a-Lago, when he reportedly requested $1bn in campaign donations from the fossil fuel industry in return for favorable legislation. Venture Global was among the “top donors” to Trump’s inauguration, donating $1m, according to theWall Street Journal.Individuals connected to Venture Global spent $860,000 on lobbying on Capitol Hill in 2024, and another $810,000 so far this year,according to Open Secrets,a non-profit campaign financial watchdog. This is more than 12-fold the previous high of $70,000 in 2019.On his first day back in the White House, Trump issued an executive order rolling back regulations to favor fossil fuel production, including LNG export licences, while revoking existing climate and clean energy policies. He withdrew the US from the global climate action treaty, the Paris agreement, and boycotted this year’s UN climate negotiations.Still, 2025 is on track to be the third hottest in history, with catastrophic floods, fires and extreme temperatures killing Americans and causing billions of dollars in damages across the US.“Altogether, the fossil industry and Trump team are producing expensive, dirty energy instead of cheaper, clean energy,” said Merkley. “The result is higher utility prices for American households, and accelerated climate chaos.”Venture Global has been contacted for comment on the call for an investigation.Explore more on these topicsOil and gas companiesTrump administrationUS politicsShareReuse this content"

On Wednesday, Weiss promoted Tony Dokoupil, the co-host of the network’s morning show, to serve as the next anchor of CBS Evening News starting 5 January.In her first few weeks on the job,Weiss expressed interestin a handful of top anchors from rival networks, including Bret Baier and Dana Perino at Fox News, but both are locked into long-term contracts. Looking internally, Dokoupil, 44, was seen as a strong contender, along with Norah O’Donnell, who anchored the show from 2019 to 2025.Picking a new evening news anchor was also a matter of necessity. Earlier this year, the show launched with a dual-anchor format, shedding viewers in the process. But both of the anchors involved –John DickersonandMaurice DuBois– have already announced plans to leave the network, leaving CBS without anyone to host the show going into the new year.“We live in a time in which many people have lost trust in the media. Tony Dokoupil is the person to win it back,” Weiss said in a statement on Wednesday. “That’s because he believes in old school journalistic values: asking the hard questions, following the facts wherever they lead and holding power to account. Americans hungry for fairness will see that on display night after night.”Tom Cibrowski, president ofCBSNews, said Dokoupil “is what everyone wants in an evening-news anchor – authentic, compassionate, unafraid”.After serving as a correspondent on MSNBC, Dokoupil joined CBS News in 2016 and has served as co-host of CBS Mornings since 2019.In the fall of 2024, he became embroiled in a significant internal – and external – controversy at the network, after he conducted a combative interview of the author Ta-Nehisi Coates. Dokoupil suggested during the interview that Coates’s recently-released book could have been found in the backpack of an “extremist”, sparking significant blowback on social media, where clips of the confrontation quickly went viral.The controversy was turbo-charged after a top CBS News executive, Adrienne Roark,told network staffers during a morning staff meetingthat Dokoupil’s interview with Coates violated editorial guidelines about impartiality and had been “addressed” with the host.But Roark, and her boss Wendy McMahon, were quickly undermined by Shari Redstone, Paramount’s controlling shareholder,who said at an industry eventa few days later that CBS News leadership had made a “bad mistake” in upbraiding Dokoupil.The media newsletter Status first reported on Monday evening that CBS News had landed on Dokoupil for the role. “I’m honored to join a fearless team at this important moment, and with what I can promise is a commitment to trust and the plain truth,” Dokoupil said in a statement.The network said that Dokoupil will begin his tenure anchoring the show with a cross-country tour.While NBC News and ABC News have largely enjoyed consistency in their evening anchormen, CBS News has gone through a series of hosts over the last 15 years, with one network staffer likening the evening anchor chair to “the electric chair” because the role does not tend to last.After the lengthy tenure of anchor Dan Rather ended in controversy in 2005, after the network aired a flawed report about George W Bush’s service in the Texas air national guard, Bob Schieffer filled the role on an interim basis for about a year.CBS shelled out a lot of money to bring in NBC star Katie Couric for the role, but she left in 2011, after five years.Asked by an interviewerat the time why her broadcast remained behind NBC and ABC in viewers, Couric responded: “I believe we were in third place for 13 years before I got here, and I think habits, particularly with an evening news broadcast, move at a glacial pace.”Couric was replaced by Scott Pelley, who also lasted about six years before he was oustedwithout a successor in place. There was Anthony Mason, who anchored the show for a few months in 2017, and then Jeff Glor, who lasted less than two years in the role.Despite a great deal of fanfare, and a move of the show from New York City to Washington DC, O’Donnell was also unable to dramatically increase viewership in her tenure as anchor, when she was replaced by Dickerson and DuBois, who had the shortest recent tenure as permanent hosts. Under the guidance of Bill Owens, legendary executive producer of 60 Minutes, the CBS Evening News had tried a new format prioritizing longer segments less tied to the ins and outs of national politics. That format did not prove to be a hit with viewers either.“Good luck to him,” the CBS News staffer said of Dokoupil. “He’s gonna need it.”Explore more on these topicsMediaCBSTelevision industryUS television industrynewsShareReuse this content"

SO EXCITING! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent,” Trumpwroteon Wednesday on social media.An official governmentwebpagepromises US residency “in record time” with the new “Trump Gold Card” – once applicants have paid a $15,000 processing fee to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), passed a background check and paid up $1m.Per a Septemberexecutive order, individuals are required to pay $1m, while businesses sponsoring employees are required to pay $2m. Firms then need to pay a 1% annual maintenance fee of $20,000, and a 5% transfer fee of $100,000 each time they want to switch the visa from one employee to another.The program comes as the Trump administration devotes significant resources to deporting millions of undocumented immigrants. The gold card program has already faced heavy criticism by seemingly contradicting the US’s traditional reputation as a refuge for the hardworking poor.A “Trump Platinum Card” is also “coming soon”, according to the official website. This card will allow holders to spend up to 270 days in the US without being subject to US taxes on non-US income. It will cost $5m.According to Trump, proceeds from the new program will go to “an account where we can do things positive for the country” and that it will generate “many billions of dollars”.Trump signed an executive order in September announcing the official launch of the gold card. When the program was first reported in February, the price for a visa was $5m. The discounted price tag may give the card a competitive edge compared with similar “pay to jump the line” programs in other countries. For example, New Zealand’snew golden visaprogram costs nearly $3m (US dollars), but managed to attract strong interest from wealthy Americans following Trump’s re-election.“Essentially, we’re having people come in, people that, in many cases, I guess, are very successful or whatever,” the president said back in September. “They’re going to spend a lot of money to come in. They’re going to pay, as opposed to walking over the borders.”DHS secretary Kristi Noempraisedthe program on X, saying “under this historic initiative, qualified individuals and corporations, who contribute $1 million and $2 million respectively, will receive expedited EB-1 or EB-2 green cards following rigorous vetting”.Explore more on these topicsUS newsUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

It could join the stock market in about June or July, according Reuters, which cited an unnamed source familiar with the matter.A flotation could rival the market value that the oil company Saudi Aramco achieved during its listingin 2019, which remains the biggest in history. It raised $29bn at the time, at a valuation of $1.7tn.SpaceX could raise “significantly more than £30bn”, according to a separate report by Bloomberg, which said Musk was targeting an overall valuation of about $1.5tn.Reuters said SpaceX planned to use the funds from the public listing to fund its space-based datacentres, including buying the chips required to run them.The company was expected to make about $15bn in revenue in 2025, rising to between $22bn and $24bn in 2026, Bloomberg reported. Most of this is due to come from Starlink, its internet satellite business.Last week, media reports suggested SpaceX was in talks with investors about a share sale that would value it at $800bn, pitting it against OpenAI to become the most valuable private company in the world.However, Musk said the reports were inaccurate on Saturday. He wrote: “SpaceX has been cashflow positive for many years and does periodic stock buybacks twice a year to provide liquidity for employees and investors. Valuation increments are a function of progress with Starship and Starlink and securing global direct-to-cell spectrum that greatly increases our addressable market.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Everything was fine at the beginning of November, results forReal Madridexcellent. Since when precious little has gone his way. The manager desperately needed something here. When this latest game eluded him, it was easy to fear the worst. Time is not a commodity afforded to men in his position.Alonso has now won twice in eight matches in all competitions and the pain was deep, the frustration given an extra twist by the reality that his players did put it in for him. They were unable to bend the occasion to their will. The margins were against them.Madueke and Martinelli wondergoals make it perfect six for Arsenal at Club BruggeRead moreFor Pep Guardiola, there was simply satisfaction. The Manchester City manager had arrived in Madrid needing a responseto the home defeat against Bayer Leverkusenin the previous Champions League game.Guardiola got his lineup wrong that night and he took no chances on a return to a venue that has inspired so many emotions for him over the years, going as strong with it as possible. The result was a come-from-behind victory that tasted extremely sweet. It was not a vintage City performance and yet there was still plenty to like about it. Not least the scoreline. City were good enough.Madrid were set fair when Rodrygo scored for the first time in 33 club-level appearances and ran into an embrace with Alonso during the celebrations. Much would be made of that.But the whistles from the home fans would be shrill when it was all over. Nico O’Reilly equalised for City, his firstChampions Leaguegoal embellishing a thrusting display and Erling Haaland scored what proved to be the winner from the penalty spot.View image in fullscreenRodrygo fires Real Madrid in front during the first half.Photograph: Kieran McManus/ShutterstockMadrid fought and they had the chances to pinch something, not least when the substitute, Endrick, headed against the crossbar in the closing stages. Alonso had introduced him for the central defender, Raúl Asencio, in an all or nothing move. Ultimately, it was nothing. Alonso grasped for the positives in the aftermath. The footballing gods are not in his corner.It was Alonso’s 22nd game in charge and among his problems was a defensive injury crisis plus Kylian Mbappé being unfit. The striker was named among the substitutes, but when he did not warm up before the kick-off it was revealing. He would remain on the bench.Everybody had expected goals and the initial exchanges suggested they were a racing certainty. Alonso almost got the early one he craved when Vinícius Júnior swayed one way and then the other on the edge of the City area and was fouled by Matheus Nunes’s swiping challenge. The referee, Clément Turpin, pointed to the penalty spot only for the video assistant referee to rule that the offence was fractionally outside the area. Federico Valverde’s free‑kick deflected and flashed past the far post.Madrid did not look like a team in crisis at the outset. There was a fluidity about them, width on both sides. Jude Bellingham had the licence to roam; ditto Vinícius. Madrid were able to stretch City.Vinícius went close on seven minutes, dinking wide from Rodrygo’s glorious low cross and the breakthrough had been advertised. When Álvaro Carreras sparked a break from left-back, having wrestled Bernardo Silva off the ball, Madrid worked it via Bellingham out right to Rodrygo. He was too quick for the covering O’Reilly. The finish was arrowed into the far corner.And relax? Hardly. The vulnerabilities of this Madrid team were stamped all over the remainder of the first half, their descent from a position of strength startling. They would have been 3-1 down by the interval had Thibaut Courtois not made a double save to keep out Haaland and Rayan Cherki after O’Reilly had crossed from the left.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

[an overseas match] is still our goal. We keep getting closer and hope soon we will achieve it.\"La Liga had proposed hosting a match between Barcelona and Villarreal at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium in December, but the plan collapsed amid fierce criticism, player protests and legal challenges. Real Madrid filed complaints with Spain's sports ministry, accusing the league and Spanish FA of bypassing clubs.\"One match out of 380 matches is nothing, and it would really help us grow our audiovisual product,\" Tebas said. \"And not just in the US; we'd also love to bring [a La Liga game] to Saudi Arabia. It is still our objective, and each time we've got closer to achieving it. The next time, we trust we will achieve it.\"ReutersWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The match turned when Josko Gvardiol rose above Bellingham to work Courtois from Cherki’s corner; the goalkeeper could only shovel the ball out to O’Reilly who shot home. Madrid argued that Rúben Dias had fouled Antonio Rüdiger, Mbappé gesturing at the numerous screens up in the rafters to make the point. The offence was not there.O’Reilly was involved in the goal for 2-1 and so was Rüdiger, who endured a difficult night. Guardiola would say he was fortunate not to collect a second yellow card in the second half. When O’Reilly crossed, Haaland was too sharp with his movement and Rüdiger seemed to panic, grabbing him and falling on top of him. The only surprise was that Turpin did not give the penalty straight away. He needed a nudge from the VAR. Haaland relished the responsibility from the spot.How much did Alonso’s players want to fight for him in the second half? It was a legitimate question given the leaks from the dressing room that indicated they have not exactly been enthused by him. They did fight, Bellingham blowing a golden chance for 2-2 when his chip was too heavy with only Gianluigi Donnarumma in front of him.City grew into the game. Cherki wanted to showcase his tricks and he almost helped his team to another goal; he narrowly missed Haaland with one pass. Jérémy Doku was brave and direct on the ball; Guardiola would lavish praise on him.Vinícius could not release Rodrygo on the hour, O’Reilly getting back to tackle and Madrid, gripped by increasing desperation, would push in the last 15 minutes. Vinícius headed off target and volleyed another chance high. When Endrick was denied by the woodwork, the writing was on the wall.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueReal MadridManchester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Moore, who is married with three young daughters, did not return a message from the Associated Press seeking comment.Later Wednesday evening, ESPN reported that Moore was in police custody for an undisclosed reason.“The City of Saline Police Department assisted in locating and detaining former University of Michigan football coach Sherrone Moore,” the department’s statement to ESPNsaid. “Mr Moore was turned over to the Pittsfield Township Police Department for investigation into potential charges.”The 39-year-old Moore was 9-3 this year after going 8-5 in his debut season.He signed a five-year contract with a base annual salary of $5.5m last year. According to the terms of his deal, the university will not have to buy out the remaining years of Moore’s contract because he was fired for cause.College football’s winningest program is suddenly looking for a third coach in four years, shortly after a busy cycle that included Lane Kiffin leaving playoff-bound Mississippi for LSU.Moore, the team’s former offensive coordinator, was promoted to the lead the Wolverines after they won the 2023 national title. He succeeded Jim Harbaugh, who returned to the NFL to lead the Los Angeles Chargers.The 18th-ranked Wolverines (9-3, 7-2 Big Ten) are set to play No. 14 Texas on Dec. 31 in the Citrus Bowl.Biff Poggi, who filled in for Moore when he was suspended earlier this season, will serve as interim coach.Moore, in his second season, was suspended for two games this year as part of self-imposed sanctions for NCAA violations related to a sign-stealing scandal. The NCAA added a third game to the suspension, which would have kept Moore off the sideline for next year’s opener against Western Michigan.Moore previously deleted an entire 52-message text thread on his personal phone with former staffer Connor Stalions, who led the team’s sign-sealing operation. The texts were later recovered and shared with the NCAA.Just a few years ago, Moore was Harbaugh’s top assistant and regarded as a rising star.Moore, who is from Derby, Kansas, didn’t start playing football until his junior year of high school. He played for Butler County Community College in Kansas and as an offensive lineman for coach Bob Stoops at Oklahoma during the 2006 and 2007 seasons.His coaching career began as a graduate assistant at Louisville before moving on to Central Michigan, where he caught Harbaugh’s attention. Harbaugh hired him in 2018 as tight ends coach.Moore was promoted to offensive line coach and co-offensive coordinator in 2021, when the Wolverines bounced back from a 2-4, pandemic-shortened season and began a three-year run of excellence that culminated in the school’s first national title in 26 years.He worked his way up within the Wolverines’ staff and filled in as interim coach for four games during the 2023 championship season while Harbaugh served two suspensions for potential NCAA rules violations.Moore also served a one-game suspension during that year related to a recruiting infractions NCAA case.Earlier in the 2023 season, Michigan State fired coach Mel Tucker for cause after he engaged in what he described as consensual phone sex with an activist and rape survivor. In 2012, Arkansas fired coach Bobby Petrino due to a sordid scandal that involved a motorcycle crash, an affair with a woman who worked for him and being untruthful to his bosses.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsMichiganShareReuse this content"

With backup Riley Leonard dealing with a knee injury, the Colts turned to the 44-year-old Rivers, who retired at the end of the 2020 season. Rivers, who has been a high school coach since his retirement andrecently welcomed his first grandchild, played for the Colts in his final season after a long stint with the Chargers.Nick Sirianni slams ‘ridiculous’ calls to bench Jalen Hurts amid Eagles’ skidRead moreColts head coach Shane Steichen is close friends with Rivers and approached him about returning to theNFL.“I said, ‘What do you think?’” Steichen said on Wednesday. “He said, ‘Dadgummit, let’s freaking go.”Steichen did not rule out the possibility of Rivers starting Sunday’s game against the Seahawks.“We’ll see how the week goes,” Steichen said. “We’ll get to the end of the week and make that decision.”Rivers, known for his enthusiasm and intensity during his playing career, said he was delighted with his chance to return to the NFL.“Something about it excited me and it’s kind of one of those deals, the door opens and you either walk through it and find out if you can do it or you run from it,” he said. “I know there’s risk involved, what may or may not happen, but the only way to find out is going for it.”Rivers was listed at 6ft 5in and 228lb in his final season in the NFL. On Wednesday, he conceded he may be heavier now.“I don’t know [my weight now], just being honest,” he said, drawing laughter from reporters. “It’s not what it was when I walked away. I follow up with that, though, that I never ran away from anybody anyway.”Rivers said he was confident he could handle the physical challenges of the NFL in his fifth decade.“I’m trying to pick it back up,” he said. “I’ve still been very into [football since I retired]. But, yeah, it is a physical game and it’s fast and dudes are big and fast, just like they were. So, shoot, you take it a day at a time. And I do feel good. There’s something about being back in this building that feels right and I’m just thankful.”The Colts looked set for the postseason when they topped the AFC South with an 8-2 record, but have since lost three games in a row and are just outside the final playoff place in the AFC. The Colts’ remaining schedule is tough as they face four teams who look set for the postseason: the Seahawks, 49ers, Jaguars and Texans.Rivers, an eight-time Pro Bowler, is seventh inNFLhistory for passing yards (63,440) and sixth in touchdown passes (421). He led the Colts to the playoffs in his final season, throwing 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions.Explore more on these topicsIndianapolis ColtsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The news comes a day after the Mets’ long-term closer, Edwin Díaz,reached a three-year dealwith the Los Angeles Dodgers.Phillies near $150m deal for Schwarber while Dodgers reel in top closer DíazRead moreThe 31-year-old slugger had been unable to find a long-term deal last season and returned to the Mets on a shorter contract, which he opted out of after this year’s World Series. While the Mets were interested in re-signing him they reportedly never made an offer once other teams were willing to offer longer, more valuable deals to the the first baseman.Alonso has spent his entireMLBcareer with the Mets, and last season broke Darryl Strawberry’s franchise record for home runs. He ends his Mets career with 264 home runs. He was also incredibly popular with the team’s fans due to his good-nature and power, earning the nickname Polar Bear. The Mets also lost another long-term popular player, Brandon Nimmo, last month in a trade with the Texas Rangers.Alonso had one of the best offensive seasons of his career in 2025 – he hit .272 with 38 home runs and 126 RBIs – but there are concerns about his defense, a weak point for the Mets, and base running, and the Mets appeared reluctant to give him a multi-year deal when they have already have Juan Soto and Francisco Lindor on expensive, long-term contracts.Over his Mets career, Alonso hit .253 with 264 home runs and 712 RBIs and an OPS of .857. He was the NL rookie of the year in 2019, when he hit 53 home runs, and a five-time All Star.Alonso joins an Orioles team that finished last in the AL East last season, although they have several young stars such as Adley Rutschman, Gunnar Henderson and Jackson Holliday.Explore more on these topicsNew York MetsMLBUS sportsBaseballnewsShareReuse this content"

And while the International Olympic Committee insisted on Tuesday that everything would be ready on time, the NHL commissioner, Gary Bettman, made it clear he was not entirely happy.“The fact that the building at this point still isn’t completed is – and I won’t use any other adjectives – disappointing,” Bettman said.Meanwhile the NHL deputy commissioner, Bill Daly, warned organisers that the 14,700-seat arena had to be able to withstand three games in a day otherwise the players would not show up. “If the ice isn’t ready and it’s not safe, then we’re not going,” Daly said. “I mean, I think that’s pretty self-evident.”Construction delays have meant that there will be no ice in the arena before the new year – with the test event now being pushed back to 9-11 January. The IOC president, Kirsty Coventry, insisted that despite the hiccups, it would be a case of all right on the night.“We need to push through and continue until the very last moment,” she said. “But we’re very impressed, very happy with everything that we’re seeing and hearing. As we get close, we just need to keep our finger on the pulse in terms of the ice hockey rink.The IOC sports director, Pierre Ducrey, also insisted that concerns around the small rink size had now been “successfully resolved” with the NHL and its players. “So we are very happy with where we stand at present,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterOur picture editors select their favourite sporting images from the past week, from the spectacular to the powerful, and with a little bit of fun thrown inEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet it became a watershed that would alter US sport and global football politics alikeJonathan WilsonWed 10 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 09.42 ESTShare“The United States was chosen,” the columnist George Vecsey wrote in the New York Times in 1994, “because of all the money to be made here, not because of any soccer prowess. Our country has been rented as a giant stadium and hotel and television studio.” Nobody could seriously doubt that. The USA had played in only two World Cups since the second world war and hadn’t had a national professional league for a decade. And that meant there was a great deal of skepticism from outsiders, even after Fifa made it clear there would be no wacky law changes to try to appeal to the domestic audience: Would anybody actually turn up to watch?But there was also hostility in the United States. A piece in USA Today on the day of the draw told Americans they were right not to careabout the World Cup, what it sneeringly described as the biggest sportin “Cameroon, Uruguay and Madagascar”. “Hating soccer,” wrote thecolumnist Tom Weir, “is more American than mom’s apple pie, drivinga pickup or spending Saturday afternoon channel surfing with the remotecontrol.”Behind both, perhaps, lay the same thought. What if hosting the World Cup turned out to be the stimulus the United States needed to embrace soccer? Foreign skeptics perhaps feared too much growth in the United States and possible domination of the global game; American skeptics worried what a soccer boom might mean for the four major US sports. Fifa just hoped there was money to be made.What nobody doubted was that the United States would bring glitz, glamour, and razzmatazz. The draw was held in Las Vegas and starred such luminaries as Bill Clinton, Faye Dunaway, Jeff Bridges, and Jessica Lange. The opening ceremony, staged at Soldier Field in Chicago before the defending champion Germany – playing at a World Cup as a unified nation for the first time since 1938 – faced Bolivia, was a lavish, sun-drenched affair presented by Oprah Winfrey and featuring turns by Diana Ross, Daryl Hall, and The B-52’s. But the omens were terrible. Winfrey fell off the stage and twisted her ankle. Ross dragged a shot wide of an open goal from three yards. Germany won a desultory opening game 1–0. And the whole thing was overshadowed by the LAPD’s televised pursuit through Los Angeles earlier in the day of the American football star turned murder suspect, OJ Simpson.The United States had been awarded hosting rights, appropriately enough, on 4 July 1988. Chile had withdrawn from the race and Brazil had still not installed Havelange’s son-in-law, Ricardo Teixeira, as CBF president, which effectively left a straight fight between the United States and Morocco. It was a close-run thing, the United States winning out by 10 votes to Morocco’s seven, with Brazil on two. It was the third tournament awarded by the Havelange regime and already the process was drowning in paranoia and suspicion. Had the ban Mexico received from the 1990 World Cup for fielding overage players in a youth tournament been an attempt to smooth the USA’s passage to 1994 by giving them tournament experience?Havelange was certain the United States was a market ripe for exploitation, but even though Fifa talked boldly of hosting the World Cup as a way of stimulating interest in the game, there were plenty of doubters. Would it be possible to lay grass over the artificial surfaces at the Pontiac Silverdome in Michigan and the Giants Stadium in New Jersey? What would the impact be of staging the tournament over such a vast geographical area? And how would players cope in the heat and humidity, particularly with games kicking off at noon and midafternoon to accommodate European TV markets?More broadly, what did prioritizing potential commercial markets over traditional soccer countries suggest about the way the game was going? The Italian president of Uefa, Artemio Franchi, had been clear he could “never agree to a World Cup for multinationals” and he wasn’t the only one who disliked the overtly commercial route soccer was taking under Havelange. He was killed in a car crash in 1983 and there were enough unexplained details about his death to prompt an investigation by the journalist Alberto Ballarin, who identified two untraced foreign motorcyclists as potential suspects in a possible murder. Among the wilder theories about what happened on the road to Siena that night is the claim that elements at Fifa who had seen the USA miss out on hosting 1986 and 1990 took out a key obstacle to the success of their third bid.Like Colombia, Italy played with a back four and zonal marking, adapting the tenets of Total Football for their own market. And like Colombia, they had a brilliant and radical coach whose rise had been vertiginous. Arrigo Sacchi had been a shoe salesman for his father’s factory when, in 1979, aged 33, he quit to devote himself fulltime to coaching. His big break came in the 1986–87 Coppa Italia, when his Parma team, then in Serie B, beat AC Milan, which had just been acquired by Silvio Berlusconi. Berlusconi saw in Sacchi something of himself, a disruptor unbound by convention.Appointing Sacchi was an extraordinary risk, but one rapidly justified when Milan won the league in Sacchi’s first season and followed up with a pair of European Cups. After the first of them, in 1989, Milan faced Atlético Nacional in the Intercontinental Cup. They won 1–0 and Sacchi and Maturana, realizing how much they had in common, began to speak regularly.Like many who plan meticulously, Sacchi was extremely superstitious. He hated people wishing him luck; to say “good luck” to Sacchi was to lay a curse upon him. The night before Italy began their World Cup campaign against Ireland, the Italian president Oscar Luigi Scalfaro rang to wish the Italy squad good luck. What followed was, to Sacchi’s mind, typical: a classic Jack Charlton victory.One semifinal was played in New Jersey and one in California, which, with the final to be played in Pasadena, was a problem. At Giants Stadium on the East Coast, two early goals from Roberto Baggio effectively secured Italy’s win over Bulgaria. But the 2,700-mile journey cost Italy a day of preparation, which Sacchi thought decisive. In the second semi-final, Thomas Ravelli had already made a couple of fine saves before Sweden’s captain Jonas Thern was sent off for a studs-up jab on Dunga’s ankle. Romário headed the winner with 10 minutes remaining. Determined to avoid the misfortune of a good-luck message, Sacchi instructed reception in the team’s hotel in Los Angeles not to put through any calls to him. But at 4am on the morning of the final, his phone rang. It was “a girl from Bologna.” He had no idea who she was, but she uttered the fateful words: “Good luck.” Sacchi knew the game was up.Baresi made a miraculous recovery from his knee injury to start, but it wasn’t enough. Although Sacchi said that “in the defensive phase, we played very well,” he thought they were “mediocre” going forward, for which he blamed fatigue. The game was anxious and drab, ignited only after Viola had come on for Zinho with fourteen minutes of extra time remaining. It finished 0–0 and so, for the first time, a World Cup was settled on penalties.Roberto Baggio didn’t want to go first, so Baresi took responsibility and put his kick over the bar. Marcio Santos and Daniele Massaro both had their efforts saved, which meant that when Baggio stepped up to take Italy’s fifth kick, he had to score. He, too, shot over and Brazil had their fourth World Cup.In Brazil, the day after the final was declared a national holiday, but the players did not return to the adulation that had greeted previous World Cup–winning squads. When customs officials at the airport in Recife tried to get them to pay import tax on goods they’d bought in the United States, the result was a five-hour standoff that was ended only when the finance minister waved them through. A subsequent poll, though, showed that 70% of Brazilians thought they should have paid the duty; players were not the national heroes they had once been.Excerpted fromThe Power And The Gloryby Jonathan Wilson, copyright © 2025 by Jonathan Wilson.

The final mistake, an interception near the goalline in overtime, sealed another deflating loss for an Eagles side that has averaged just 16 points across the past five games. The 8-5 Eagles have not won since 10 November.Hurts’ performance tied several unwanted marks: the most giveaways by an Eagles player since tracking began in 1978 and the first four-interception game by a Philadelphia quarterback since Michael Vick in 2012.The struggles have not gone unnoticed. Boos rang out during the Eagles’ Black Friday home loss to Chicago while traveling fans voiced their frustration again in Los Angeles. With Hurts now up to six interceptions on the season – already surpassing last year’s total – the quarterback’s slump has cracked open a conversation that once seemed unthinkable less than a year removed fromhis Super Bowl MVP performance.Sirianni, however, isn’t entertaining thoughts of benching his quarterback though.“I know every time I go out in that field with Jalen Hurts as our quarterback, we have a chance to win the game,” he saidduring his weekly appearanceon Philadelphia sports-talk radio network 94 WIP. “And that’s something that’s proven. We’ve won a lot of football games. We don’t ever go in and assign something. This is a team game. You win together as a team. You lose together as a team.”Hurts’ ledger still reflects that broader truth: a 54-25 regular-season record, six wins from nine playoff games and multiple Super Bowl appearances. His teammates echoed the coach’s stance, with Saquon Barkley saying he had “all the confidence” in Hurts leading the offense in overtime, despite Monday’s mistakes.The options behind Hurts do little to strengthen the case for a change. Tanner McKee, a 2023 sixth-round pick, has made one career start; Sam Howell, acquired from Washington, remains a developmental backup. While McKee impressed in limited action late last season, neither quarterback is regarded internally as a threat to Hurts’ role.Sirianni pointed to “a lot of good things on offense” against the Chargers and insisted the group is “encouraged” heading into Sunday’s home game against the 2-11 Las Vegas Raiders, even as the wounds fromtheir epic 2023 collapsethreaten to resurface.“I come away encouraged from that game, knowing that we have things to clean up ... No one is pressing, everyone is just thinking, how do we get ourselves in the best position to win this game and play our best game this game?”Explore more on these topicsPhiladelphia EaglesNFLUS sportsShareReuse this content"

As hosts next year, little will changeSanjay SujanthakumarWed 10 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 13.15 ESTShareThe draw is done. The schedule is set. For the US men’s national team, all that’s left, aside from playing the games, are the emotional highs and lows. After the draw, US head coach Mauricio Pochettino referenced a “competitive stress” factor triggered by theWorld Cup. He said the friendlies against Belgium and Portugal in March are intended to simulate that stress so that it doesn’t surprise his players when the spotlight of the World Cup arrives.With the margins always thin at a World Cup, earning results that mitigate that pressure could prove to be the difference between the USMNT crashing out just when they capture the undivided attention of the nation, or enduring and soaring to a best-ever finish.The preparationStress can seep into the emotions of a team well before the World Cup. Landon Donovan, a veteran of three World Cups, described an excitement that’s “very palpable and different” when the squad convenes for a World Cup camp, but acknowledged “it also depends on where you are in the pecking order.”Head coach Bob Bradley had clearly conveyed to his core where they stood during the 2010 cycle, which included not just qualifiers but also the now-defunct Confederations Cup in 2009.“He had pulled us into a room a year prior [to the World Cup], about 15 of us, and said, ‘Guys, you are the 15 who are going to be there for sure,’” Donovan told the Guardian. “And over the next year, three or four more probably solidified their spot. But then there were three to six spots that were still up for grabs. Mentally, for guys who knew they were going and who were going to be contributors, it’s all about preparation. But there were other guys who were very much competing for their spots, and so everything was at stake every day.”Before the 2010 World Cup, 30 players were summoned to Bradley’s alma mater, Princeton, for camp. The first send-off friendly against the Czech Republic was the last audition for a lot of nervous players to make the 23-man squad.“When all is said and done, the hardest part is going from 30 to 23 [for the World Cup squad] in a short amount of time,” Bradley told the Guardian. “Would [I] do that exactly the same? I don’t know. You had certain decisions that had to get made. You needed to see certain guys up close, but there’s a lot of pressure, and guys felt that.”The United States must create big moments at World Cup 2026. Anything less is not enough | Leander SchaerlaeckensRead morePochettino has hinted that only the 26 players on the 2026 tournament squad will be heading to the new US Soccer national training center in Atlanta ahead of the World Cup.“I think from the beginning, if you say, ‘OK, that is the 26,’ that is a shock, but [eventually] you accept [it],” Pochettino said. “But after being involved and then that’s it, go home, I think it’s more cruel.”There’s also simply less time for late tryouts, with Pochettino’s pre-World Cup camp shorter than previous runways to the summer version of the tournament. They’ll be assembling on 27 May, with two friendlies instead of three. But it’s not quite as condensed as the preparation for World Cup in 2022, when most of Berhalter’s squad flew straight from Europe to Qatar.“It was a surreal feeling,” left-back Antonee Robinson said. “I can kind of remember the whole experience, going straight from the [Premier League] game with [Fulham teammate] Tim Ream straight to the airport and getting on the plane. And when we land in Qatar, that’s when the reality sinks [in]. ‘We’re actually here now.’”The USMNT had plenty of talent at Europe’s top clubs for the 2022 World Cup, but also boasted the tournament’s second-youngest roster.“No matter how much experience you have, when you play in a World Cup, it’s a different type of game,” Berhalter said. “And I’ll never forget the conversation with Yunus [Musah] after the Wales game, he was like, ‘Oh my God, this felt like a final of a tournament.’ That’s how intense the game was, and it’s exhausting. It’s physically exhausting, mentally exhausting, but that’s what the World Cup is.”View image in fullscreenThe US and England battled to a draw in Qatar.Photograph: Clive Mason/Getty ImagesThe group stageThere wasn’t a shortage of World Cup experience with Bradley’s squad in 2010, but Donovan was the only one set to start at his third straight tournament. In his World Cup debut in 2002 the US stunned Portugal 3-2, and eight years later they were set to face England in the World Cup opener.“I knew that the difference about a round robin World Cup tournament is that every goal is crucial, which means every play is crucial,” Donovan said. “We weren’t expected to win the [England] game – but we were confident that we were a team capable of beating them.”However, captain Steven Gerrard gave England the lead in the fourth minute.“I knew the chances of qualification [for the knockout round] go down significantly if you lose your first game,” Donovan said. “And so the pressure was on to get something out of the game.”World Cup 2026: a look at the United States’ group-stage opponentsRead moreThe US were gifted an equalizer by England goalkeeper Robert Green and held their own to secure a point, but the pressure mounted even more in their second group game against Slovenia after conceding two first-half goals.“When we got to half-time and we were down two, that was a key moment for that group. We knew we needed to get one or three points. Other than that, we’re out,” Bradley said.Less than three minutes after the break an authoritative Donovan strike cut the deficit in half. In the 82nd minute Michael Bradley tied it at 2-2. And a few minutes later, Maurice Edu buried a Donovan free kick to complete an exhilarating comeback win … but the goal was inexplicably disallowed.And in the group finale against Algeria, the pressure would keep climbing until second half stoppage time, when Donovan’s game-winner became the most famous moment in USMNT history. The win, though exhilarating, brought other issues.View image in fullscreenAntonee Robinson consoled several Iran players after a narrow US win.Photograph: Claudio Villa/Getty ImagesThe regroupAfter Donovan’s viral moment, the US had just three days to mentally reset and prepare for Ghana in the next round.“It’s really hard,” Donovan said. “It’s one of the hardest things in sports, and one of the least talked about things in sports. Of course there was a physical drain, but the emotional drain, it’s hard as a human, even as a trained athlete, to get yourself up again after such an emotional game … When you win a game in that fashion, it’s hard not to sort of let your guard down a little and feel relief. And so even immediately after the game, we’re in the locker room having a beer with President Clinton… it’s hard not to get caught up in the moment. And candidly, I’m glad we got caught up in the moment. That was one of the best few hours of our lives.”The 2022 team faced its own tense conclusion to the group stage. Although they hadn’t trailed yet in Qatar, three points slipped away late in the opener against Wales when Gareth Bale drew then converted a penalty kick. The US then held their own in another marquee group matchup with England, earning a point.“The England game was a very strong performance, but all it did was put us in position,” Berhalter said. “It was precarious. Iran, all they needed was a tie [against us], and they’re through.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The US held on for three points in an extremely tense finish.“We had a real few close calls in the match where Iran nearly equalized with us. And then on the flip side of it, that was why I was like so consoling to their players,” Robinson said. “Throughout the course of the World Cup, I had had some family things going on which was kind of why I was emotional anyway … the joy of the fact we’d actually got through, I did my ankle in that game, so the pain I was feeling, that was all swirling around at the same time and it busted me up a bit.”In 2010, with qualification secured, Bradley leaned on longtime US Soccer administrator Tom King to surprise the team by bringing their families – who were staying 20 minutes away – to celebrate at the team’s home base. Similarly in 2022, following the win over Iran, Berhalter gave his team the next day off to spend time with their families. It would be a much-needed rest before the stresses to come.View image in fullscreenThe US exited the 2010 World Cup in the Round of 16 after a loss to Ghana.Photograph: Jeff Mitchell/FIFA/Getty ImagesThe knockout roundBerhalter acknowledged that the Iran match “took a toll on the guys mentally” and the Round of 16 clash with the Netherlands “came really quickly.” The US benefited from a state-of-the-art recovery and medical setup along with a meticulously planned player lounge which Berhalter had fundraised for. But emotionally, they could only absorb so much.“We didn’t have that edge, and I don’t think we had it because there was an emotional toll that the World Cup took on the group, and we weren’t really prepared for that over time,” Berhalter said.Berhalter also points to the Netherlands’ extensive experience performing in big moments; a big contrast to his upstart US squad.“The guys were ready to play. But you have to understand that there’s a difference between playing well, and eliminating Holland in a World Cup knockout stage,” Berhalter said. “The coach has been there before, the team has been there before. These weren’t World Cup rookies, and they had the edge.”Infantino’s lickspittle World Cup draw promises a tournament autocrats will loveRead moreBradley believed his 2010 team were built for the psychological strain in South Africa, noting their high-profile friendlies during the cycle, plus their run to the Confederations Cup final the previous year.They weren’t fazed when they fell behind in the fifth minute against Ghana.“We used an expression sometimes, ‘play it on the edge,’ where you got to go for it, because now you’re behind or whatever,” Bradley said. “And we had experiences in those kinds of games where we knew how to push a game.”The US equalized with a Donovan penalty kick, but were eliminated in extra time.View image in fullscreenUS head coach Mauricio Pochettino has warned his players not to look past the group stage.Photograph: Emilee Chinn/FIFA/Getty ImagesThe expectationsIn both 2010 and 2022, the US arguably met expectations by advancing to the knockout round. But there is still disappointment, some of which is natural for any tournament exit, and some of which is rooted in the United States’ continuing quest to establish themselves among the world’s best sides.Robinson noted that the US had knockout experience and success in Concacaf, but face the challenge of translating it to a bigger stage.“We can’t lean on the fact that we’ve done it before,” he said. “It’s been a long, long time, and the players in our squad haven’t done it, but we’re just going to have to try and get into that mental gear of expecting ourselves to be able to win knockout games and go in with true belief that would go into [it] because if you turn up to the tournament and you don’t truly believe that you could actually go far and win the whole thing, then you’re putting yourself at a massive disadvantage to everyone else.”Donovan also underlined the importance of setting the bar higher than it has traditionally been in US soccer.“My opinion is that it boils down to expectations, and when we get to a point where we expect to get to a quarter-final or a semi-final or a final, like probably 8-10 other teams in the World Cup will be doing next summer, there’s a mentality piece where you’re not just satisfied to get to a certain point. You want to keep going,” Donovan said. “Everybody, of course, wants to keep going. But when we got to the quarter-finals against Germany in 2002, from an expectation standpoint we had already exceeded it. And so it was almost playing with house money.”Mauricio Pochettino urges USMNT to treat every World Cup game ‘like a final’Read moreThe expectations for those top international teams are, of course, primarily a function of their quality. While the US has not yet ascended to that tier of talent, they could get a boost from hosting the tournament in 2026. Berhalter highlighted Morocco in 2022 and Korea in 2002 as replicable examples of momentum and favorable crowds carrying those teams further than what seemed possible on paper. Robinson stressed that at a World Cup in particular, the game is not decided on paper.“It doesn’t always come down to who’s the best team, it comes down to which team wants to win more,” he said. “So making sure that we have our themes of how we want to play in the background, but the overarching theme is going to be we have to compete more, we have to fight more than the other team, and if we win that battle, then [I’m] hoping that our quality of the team shines through after that.”That will apply, first and foremost, to the group stage, where the US are favored. Friendly wins against Paraguay and Australia previewed the intensity of their World Cup meetings, featuring literal fights and hard tackles.“They were friendlies, but also they weren’t very friendly,” Tim Ream said after the draw. “And now you add in the heightened aggression and experience of a World Cup, and they’re all finals, they all mean something now. Everything is going to be ramped up exponentially.”Explore more on these topicsUSAUS sportsWorld Cup 2026World CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Bevacqua has claimed the ACC damaged Notre Dame‘s chances at making the College Football Playoff, instead campaigning for Miami’s inclusion.Miami made the CFP over the Fighting Irish, mostly because the Hurricanes won the teams’ head-to-head meeting.Bevacqua claimedthat the ACC engaged in a targeted social media campaign over multiple weeks showing it favored Miami’s inclusion in the field over Notre Dame.“The ACC does wonderful things for Notre Dame, but we bring tremendous football value to the ACC, and we didn’t understand why you would go out of your way to try to damage us in this process,” Bevacqua said on Tuesday.Later Tuesday, Yormark appeared at the Sports Business Journal’s Intercollegiate Athletics Forum and addressed Bevacqua’s criticism.“I think his behavior has been egregious,” Yormark said. “He is totally out of bounds in his approach and if he was in the room, I’d tell him the same thing.”The public pushback is notable given Bevacqua’s unique standing as Notre Dame‘s AD. For example, Bevacqua sits on the College Football Playoff Management Committee with the 10 FBS conference commissioners, representing the interests of football independent Notre Dame.Rumors have also spread about Notre Dame’s next moves if they want to split with the ACC, which included partnering up with the Big 12. That looks less likely after Yormark took Bevacqua to task on Tuesday. Yormark pointed out that the ACC gave Notre Dame a lifeline during the Covid-affected 2020 season by giving the Irish a full 10-game conference slate and a berth in its championship game against Clemson.“His behavior has been egregious,” Yormark said. “It’s been egregious going after Jim Phillips, when they saved Notre Dame during Covid ... The chair said that as Notre Dame and Miami got closer together, head to head would be a factor, OK?”Notre Dame reached the final of the CFP last season but say theywill decline a bowl gameafter missing out this year.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The England forward was subjected to a ridiculous online petition that opposed his move across London from Chelsea in the summer. But on a rare appearance on the right flank as Bukayo Saka was given a welcome rest, Madueke scored a fantastic individual goal before adding a second after half-time to set up a comfortable victory for Mikel Arteta’s side.It means Arsenal have become only the fifth English team to win their opening six matches of aChampions Leagueor European Cup campaign and now need only a point from their remaining two to rubber‑stamp their progress directly to the last 16, even if in reality it is already a formality thanks to their superior goal difference.Haaland seals Manchester City win at Real Madrid to leave Alonso on brinkRead moreMartinelli was not to be denied his moment either, as the Brazilian’s superb curling effort made him the first Arsenal player to score in five successive Champions League matches. His compatriot Gabriel Jesus made his first appearance in almost a year after an anterior cruciate ligament injury, meaning it was pretty much the perfect response that Arteta was looking for afterlosing their 18-match unbeaten recordon their last outing.“Unbelievable goal,” the Arsenal manager said of Madueke’s opener. “When you talk about individual quality and individual action and magic moments, that’s it. A player that is able to pick the ball that far, dribble past people and finish with the quality and the power that he’s done. The same as Martinelli as well. I think at this level you want to win games, you need individual players to step up and to do something different. So I’m very happy because now we have some players back in the frontline and you can tell how much better we are with them.”With Declan Rice not having travelled to Belgium because of illness, Arteta had suggested that he would look to rotate his starting lineup after the defeat by Aston Villa. But there was further bad news when he revealed before kick-off that Jurriën Timber had not recovered from a knock in time to play, meaning Christian Nørgaard and Piero Hincapié became the seventh central defensive partnership Arsenal have fielded this season.Given all that, it might not have been the best time to face aClub Bruggeside desperate to impress their new manager, Ivan Leko, after Nicky Hayen was sacked on Monday. Yet despite impressing in a 3-3 thriller against Barcelona earlier in the competition, their weakness has been at the back and Arsenal were ruthless in exploiting it. The pace of the former Wolves loanee Carlos Forbs was a constant handful for Myles Lewis-Skelly but the England left-back managed to get forward in the 21st minute and saw his wayward shot diverted on to the post by Hincapié’s quick thinking.View image in fullscreenNoni Madueke lets fly from the edge of the box to score Arsenal’s first goal in their 3-0 victory.Photograph: PA Wire via BelgaNot much appeared to be on when Madueke picked up the ball midway inside the Brugge half a minute later until a stunning piece of skill took him away from his marker. The England forward seemed to glide away from two more defenders before unleashing an unstoppable shot that went in off the crossbar.It was a goal worthy of winning any game, although Brugge continued to look dangerous, in particular through Forbs. David Raya denied the Portugal forward before Aleksandar Stankovic went close from distance. The hosts were growing in confidence. Christos Tzolis was able to find space inside the area just before half-time but Raya read his intentions before the Spaniard produced a brilliant full-length save to deny Stankovic again.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This time there was no way he could miss Martín Zubimendi’s brilliant cross from the left that picked him out unmarked at the back post.There was nothing simple about Martinelli’s personal piece of history soon afterwards as the Brazilian – who had previously scored against Athletic Bilbao, Olympiakos, Atlético Madrid and Bayern Munich – cut in from the left flank and unleashed an unstoppable curling shot to make it 3-0.Jesus almost capped his return with a goal but saw his strike cannon back off the crossbar. Marli Salmon, who starred alongside Max Dowman for Arsenal Under-18s last season, became the fourth youngest player to appear for the club at just 16 years and 102 days and looked the part for the final stages as his side took another significant step towards potential silverware.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueClub BruggeArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

There’s frustration but we’re hopefully moving in the right direction.”Newcastle’s manager saw his side fall apart – and behind – at an early corner and now must address his players’ vulnerability to set pieces ahead of Sunday’s Premier League Tyne-Wear derby at Sunderland. Then there is the question of whether the suddenly jaded Sandro Tonali should be replaced by the impressive Lewis Miley at the Stadium of Light.Howe had been expecting a tactical technical area duel with Kasper Hjulmand but Bayer Leverkusen’s manager was absent for personal reasons.That left his assistant, Rogier Meijer, to take charge of the team currently fourth in Germany’s top tier. Meijer must have been extremely content with a first half ­characterised by much slick, sharp, passing and movement as his pleasingly fluid side constantly interchanged positions.They were ahead in the 13th minute after Newcastle got themselves into a terrible tangle at a corner.When Leverkusen’s captain, Robert Andrich, dodged Tonali he was left free to direct a header goalwards. Its journey took a detour via Bruno Guimarães’s backside and the deflection left a well beaten Ramsdale thoroughly deceived. Although Andrich claimed the credit it was a Guimarães own goal.“We gave ourselves a mountain to climb,” said Howe. “But my players deserve credit for coming back.”Shortly afterwards things very nearly took another wrong turn for Newcastle. Once Patrik Schick met Malik Tillman’s fine through ball and accelerated towards the area a wrong-footed Malick Thiaw ended up felling Schick on the edge of the area.View image in fullscreenLewis Miley heads Newcastle into the lead.Photograph: Ulrik Pedersen/NurPhoto/ShutterstockThe referee initially awarded a penalty but downgraded it to a free-kick when a video assistant referee review detected the offence had occurred fractionally outside the 18-yard box. A relieved Thiaw, meanwhile, was shown a yellow card before watching Leverkusen’s set-piece specialist, Grimaldo, lift the ensuring free-kick over the crossbar. “We maybe had a bit of luck with Malick and the penalty,” Howe conceded. “That was a big moment.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even so, the home goalkeeper, Mark Flekken, did extremely well to prevent an equaliser when Grimaldo deflected Tino Livramento’s cross goalwards.Howe’s problem was that, whenever the hosts broke, his defenders looked bewildered in the face of Schick’s habit of dropping deep and dragging them out of position while leaving Tillman and Ernest Poku free to burst into the box.With half-time beckoning Thiaw – who, uncharacteristically, was struggling badly – and company had Ramsdale to thank for a stunning fingertip save from Jarell Quansah, whose advance from the back three and connection with Arthur’s right-wing delivery had proceeded unchecked.Then, five minutes, into the second half Leverkusen, or more specifically Flekken, self-destructed. As the former Brentford goalkeeper prepared to clear, he lost concentration and dawdled, permitting Woltemade to not merely close him down but, courtesy of some seriously nifty footwork, dispossess him.Flekken responded by pushing Woltemade over and Anthony Gordon made no mistake from the penalty spot. As Gordon celebrated his fifth Champions League goal this season the mortified keeper pulled his jersey over his face.There was to be no hiding place for Flekken though and he was very nearly beaten again when Gordon’s shot rebounded off the inside of a post.Miley, who had just replaced the injured Joelinton in midfield, thought he had won it when he headed Gordon’s cross home before Grimaldo eased a little of Flekken’s pain by enjoying the final word.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueBayer LeverkusenNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

With five defeats from their first five league phase games, Ajax were effectively facing elimination with another defeat – but the visitors produced a dramatic late fightback.Oscar Gloukh drew Ajax level again 11 minutes from time with a drilled low shot into the bottom corner. Four minutes later, the visitors went ahead as Anton Gaaei finished a counterattack with a fine finish into the top corner.

You can see from the league standings that the points are so close, so you’ve got to take every opportunity that you get.”Making her first appearance since a frustrating 1-1 draw with Liverpool on 16 November, Bright returned to the starting XI for Sonia Bompastor’s team after two games sat on the bench. Bright was one of six changes to the Chelsea side defeated 1-0 by Everton on Sunday.Quick GuideRoundup: Pajor keeps Barcelona in top spotShowEwa Pajor (pictured) was on target for Barcelona in a 3-1 home win over Benfica that all but guarantees their place in the Women's Champions League quarter-finals.Pajor opened the scoring just before the half four – her 15th in 16 appearances in the tournament's group or league phase. According to Uefa, only Chelsea striker Kerr has more at this stage of the Champions League, with 16 goals.Chandra Davidson equalized for Benfica just after half-time, but two goals in the space of four minutes effectively sealed the win for Barcelona.

It’s never an easy position to be put in by the decisions I’ve made … the perfect answer you can give to a manager is the performance tonight on the pitch.”Chelsea started brightly at Stamford Bridge and Roma, despite a disappointing Champions League campaign which means they are unable to progress beyond the league phase, looked like they wanted to make a statement early on, with Giulia Dragoni and Rinsola Babajide effective on the right.View image in fullscreenJohanna Rytting Kaneryd scores Chelsea’s third goal from close range before half-time.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersAn shot from the captain, Manuela Giugliano, flew over the bar from distance in their best effort of an open 10 minutes but their hard work was undone in the 13th minute, as Valentina Bergamaschi headed powerfully into her own net after Sandy Baltimore’s cross evaded Sam Kerr. It was a hammer blow for the visiting team and momentum swung Chelsea’s way. It was two before the half-hour, Rytting Kaneryd headed the ball into the middle and Kerr stepped away to allow Kaptein to fire in.It was a deserved lead and the Blues extended it shortly before the break, Olivie Lukasova saved from Kerr after Niamh Charles’s ball in but Rytting Kaneryd was at the far post to turn in.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nüsken converted from the spot to put Chelsea four up.Bompastor’s side were ruthless in their pursuit of more goals, the defeat by Everton perhaps lighting a fire in frustrated bellies after they handed Manchester City a six-point advantage at the top of the Women’s Super League table.“It’s probably about players’ confidence and the quality of the team we are facing,” the manager said when asked why the goals came so comprehensively against Roma but not against Everton or in their preceding 1-1 draw with Liverpool.The home team’s fifth arrived via Maika Hamano, Guro Reiten’s run exposing the chaotic Roma backline. She collected Bright’s ball over the top before prodding it to the Japanese midfielder to send past Lukasova. The sixth came from the veteran defender Lucy Bronze.Job done, a trip to the two‑time Champions League winners Wolfsburg in Chelsea’s final match of the group phase next Wednesday is the only thing standing between Bompastor’s side and an automatic place in the last eight.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueChelsea WomenRoma WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Lyonnes are now all but guaranteed of their place in that quartet and they demonstrated a gulf in quality between themselves and the Women’s Super League side.Skinner’s team selection raised eyebrows, not least because of the surprise inclusion of Rachel Williams as the central striker. The 37‑year‑old veteran’s involvement came while creative midfielders such as Ella Toone and Jess Park were left on the substitutes bench. Skinner said: “You can lose a game against Lyonnes on set-pieces, on physicality, so we had to have balance. We looked at four games in 10 days, so we’ve got to be able to rotate.“I won’t have anyone go ‘Oh, well, you don’t rotate’ and then you do rotate and it’s not right, so, you’ve got to. There’s got to be a plan ahead of all of the games coming. But we needed to match them physically and then adapt it and change it in the second half.

Their arrivals did prompt an injection of fresh intensity into the midfield, but Lyonnes were still creating dangerous chances, with Ada Hegerberg lashing narrowly wide with her left foot around the hour.The record eight-time European champions –who won away at Arsenal, the defending champions, in October and whose only dropped points came in an away draw at Juventus – have looked genuine contenders to go all the way this season and their composure on the ball only added to that impression.Dumornay was already the star of the show before she produced two late finishes of the highest quality, first collecting a Jule Brand cut-back and finding the top corner expertly in the 81st minute, before another equally clinical finish as the clock ticked past the 90th minute. At the other end, the hosts had failed to produce a single effort on target.Skinner described Lyonnes as “probably one of the best teams that will ever walk the planet”, as he played down the significance of the defeat.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueManchester United WomenOL LyonnesWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Rainbow flags will also be allowed into the stadium byFifa.Egypt and Iran ask Fifa to prevent LGBTQ+ Pride celebration at World Cup 2026 matchRead moreHomosexuality is illegal in Iran, and in Egypt morality laws are often used to prosecute LGBTQ+ people. The Egyptian football federation said this week that it had written to Fifa’s general secretary to complain about the Pride Match, saying it did not want to be associated with celebrations that “directly contradict the cultural, religious and social values … in Arab and Islamic societies”. The head of Iran’s football federation, Mehdi Taj, was quoted by the local news agency ISNA as saying it too had raised “objections against the issue”.The organising committee for Seattle said in a statement that its plans for activities were outside the stadium and would go ahead. “As the local organising committee, SeattleFWC26’s role is to prepare our city to host the matches and manage the city experience outside of Seattle Stadium,” said Hana Tedesse, the vice-president of communications for Seattle FifaWorld Cup 2026.“SeattleFWC26 is moving forward as planned with our community programming outside the stadium during Pride weekend and throughout the tournament, partnering with LGBTQ+ leaders, artists and business owners to elevate existing Pride celebrations across Washington.”Fifa has operational control of stadiums on matchdays, and it is understood there have been no plans in place to acknowledge Pride weekend inside the ground. Although Fifa prohibits banners and flags with political messages from being taken into stadiums during the tournament, it allows flags expressing “sporting and social symbols”, which includes the rainbow flag. This policy was applied at the lastWorld Cupin Qatar, and reinforced after reports of rainbow flags being seized by local authorities.The Pride Match concept was devised by the Seattle committee and highlights “our city’s proud history of advocating for equality” while the world’s eyes are on the city. It has commissioned a design contest to create images to commemorate the occasion, with one webpage illustrated by a photo of the rainbow flag being paraded through Seattle Stadium.Tedesse said the organising committee would work to ensure all fans felt welcome in the city during the 48-team tournament next summer. “The Pacific Northwest is home to one of the nation’s largest Iranian‑American communities, a thriving Egyptian diaspora and rich communities representing all nations we’re hosting in Seattle,” she said in a statement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is due to report for Africa Cup of Nations duty with Egypt on Monday.Arne Slot full of praise for Liverpool efforts after gritty win against InterRead moreSzoboszlai converted the decisive penalty that condemned Inter to a first European defeat at San Siro in more than three years and is among Salah’s closest friends atLiverpool. But the Hungary captain admitted Salah’s teammates would have no input into how the divisive episode is resolved.“I’m very close with him,” said Szoboszlai, who has taken Salah’s place on the right since the striker was first dropped at West Ham. “It’s nothing to do with the players. It’s him and his own choice with what he is doing with his own life and his own career.”Asked whether he wanted Salah to stay, the midfielder said: “It’s not our decision as players. I love him as a human being, as a friend of mine. As a player he has done so much for this club it’s going to be the club’s and is decision.”Liverpool players were reluctant to be drawn into the Salah situation after their victory at San Siro. Curtis Jones insisted the controversy had not affected the atmosphere in the dressing room and that Liverpool’s display against Inter demonstrated the team remained firmly behind Slot. “We always are, we always are,” Jones said.“He [Slot] is human at the end of the day. If we get beat in games it affects him; it affects us all too the same way it affects fans. He is a positive man, he always makes a change.“The style of play has changed a bit.

It is a way of getting all the lads in the team. It is obviously hard to keep everybody happy. We are in a situation where it is hard with the games we have lost.

Now professional camel racing has a new high-profile investor:Paul Pogba.The Monaco midfielder said he had become a shareholder in the Saudi Arabia-based Al Haboob, the world’s first professional camel racing team competing across the United Arab Emirates and the Gulf, because he wanted to “elevate the sport on to a global stage”.Paul Pogba is a footballer again after two years out, a ban and a kidnap case | Luke EntwistleRead moreThe former Manchester United player said: “I’ve always been someone who wants to try new things and do things differently – whether it’s how I play, how I express myself, or how I approach life off the pitch. That mindset has followed me into my business world, too.”The sport involves significant investment, with top camels selling for millions of pounds and races offering large prizes. Last year the prize pool for the AlUla Camel Cup, the most lucrative competition in the sport, was $6.4m (£4.81m) across 16 races.Pogba, who became the world’s most expensive player when he joined Manchester United from Juventus in 2016 for £89m, has set his sights on owning the world’s most expensive camel.“Owning the world’s most expensive camel one day would be a beautiful full-circle moment – something fun, something meaningful and something that excites me,” hetold the BBC. “Maybe one day we make it happen.”Al Haboob, founded by the entrepreneurs Omar Almaeena and Safwan Modir, is the first modern camel racing team to compete internationally. Modir said the team’s aspirations go far beyond sport.View image in fullscreenPaul Pogba said he had ‘spent time doing research in my spare time trying to understand the techniques and strategies’ of camel racing.Photograph: Mohammed Elsayed“At Al Haboob, we do not merely represent a racing team – we represent the ambition of a nation, the belief of a people, and a genuine determination for Saudis to be No 1 across every field of life, from sport and business to culture and innovation.”In the past, camel racing has been criticised for low standards of animal welfare and for its use of child jockeys. However the sport now uses robot jockeys, equipped with GPS tracking, and Modir has said Al Haboob’s camels are trained and cared for to world-class standards.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Chelsea were dominant against Roma, OL Lyonnes displayed why they are eight-time winners and there was a nailbiter between Atletico Madrid and Bayern Munich. Here’s a round-up of the action from all five matches today, including the two earlier kick-offs:Quick GuideRoundup: Pajor keeps Barcelona in top spotShowEwa Pajor (pictured) was on target for Barcelona in a 3-1 home win over Benfica that all but guarantees their place in the Women's Champions League quarter-finals.Pajor opened the scoring just before the half four – her 15th in 16 appearances in the tournament's group or league phase. According to Uefa, only Chelsea striker Kerr has more at this stage of the Champions League, with 16 goals.Chandra Davidson equalized for Benfica just after half-time, but two goals in the space of four minutes effectively sealed the win for Barcelona. Christy Ucheibe turned Alexia Putellas' cross into her own net in the 54th minute, and Laia Aleixandri forced the ball home to make it 3-1.There was still time for Barça to win a penalty, but Benfica keeper Lena Pauels saved well to deny Putellas. Victory means Barcelona top the league phase with one game to go, three points clear of Real Madrid in fifth and Juventus in sixth, with a vastly superior goal difference.Twelve teams advance from the league phase, with the top four going straight to the quarter-finals and the other eight sides entering playoffs.Paris FC, who host Barça in their final game, boosted their hopes of a playoff place as a late Lorena Azzaro penalty at Vålerenga, who had Karina Saevik was sent off.Bayern Munichsit fourth after battling to a 2-2 draw atAtlético Madrid. The hosts started well and took the lead through Vilde Bøe Risa's penalty, with Giulia Gwinn missing a spot kick for the visitors.Pernille Harder levelled just after the hour and then volleyed Bayern in front with 12 minutes to go, but Fiamma's stunning late strike crashed in off the bar to earn Atlético a point and all but assure them of a playoff place.AP/Guardian sportPhotograph: Quality Sport Images/Getty Images EuropeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.And below are two reports of the later kick-offs.

The 34-year-old double Rugby World Cup winner also appeared to distance himself from the act by drawing attention to “other factors”. Along with three videos accompanying the post, Etzebeth claimed two Welsh players involved in the fracas, along with Mann, changed “the dynamic of the entire picture”.South Africa’s Eben Etzebeth handed 12-week ban for eye-gouging against WalesRead moreEtzebeth will be sidelined until April after an 18-week ban, for what was deemed a mid-range offence, was reduced to 12 weeks due to mitigating factors including his previous good disciplinary record.“I’ve been quiet, but now that my hearing is done, I think I owe everyone an explanation,” Etzebeth wrote. “I accept guilt. I made a mistake and I’m willing to serve a suspension which I deserve …“I don’t want young kids who look up to the Springboks to think that it’s OK to eye gouge someone, because it’s not, but unfortunately mistakes happen … I would never do something like this on purpose, I know what the consequences will be after playing rugby for a few years.”As in his evidence to the ­disciplinary hearing, Etzebeth said he had been struck by Mann in his neck/chin area, which was not spotted by the officials, before retaliating with an open-handed blow.“You can clearly see my first point of contact is against his shoulder with an open hand, just like he did, except he got me on the chin,” Etzebeth wrote.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Gloucester fly-half argued a potential knock-on effect would be for international coaches to convert second-rows into wings for the next men’s Rugby World Cup in 2027.Ross Byrne says escort defender crackdown could see locks converted to wingsRead moreByrne believes the sport risks becoming one-dimensional but before the Tigers’ Champions Cup pool meeting with Leinster on Friday, Parling acknowledged World Rugby’s move has led to more kicking, but that had not altered his tactical approach.“The change has been positive,” Parling said. “I think it’s opened up the game a little bit more. It has meant that teams are more likely to kick. Depending on the outcome you really wanted from World Rugby – was it to kick more? Well, that is what’s happened. But it’s more open kicking, because you get the tap-backs, and the ball on the floor, and suddenly you’re playing unstructured attack opportunities.“I think you’re seeing it with some tall wingers at the moment,” Parling added. “We’ve got Freddie Steward and you get these taller and taller outside backs. That doesn’t mean there’s no place for some small blokes. You look at Cheslin Kolbe for South Africa, he gets up and competes really well. I’m fine with the rule adaptation, I think it’s been pretty positive.”On whether he is telling his team to kick more after the law crackdown, Parling said: “No. I always knew the importance of a kick game. It’s very important wherever you go. It’s the first thing I focused on in the first week I arrived [at Welford Road in the summer]. We’ve not changed anything but we know it’s a very important part of the game.”Parling also made clear his disappointment at the England lock George Martin’s decision to leave for Saracens, while praising his remaining second-row options. “We would have liked him to stay but George says he’d like a fresh start,” Parling said. “We’re disappointed because he’s a quality player when he’s fit.

Former skaters such as Canada’s triple world medallist Kaitlyn Weaver, a member of the ISU’s ice dance technical committee, have lobbied the ISU to change the rule.Retired Olympic ice dance champions Madison Hubbell of the US and Gabriella Papadakis of France have skated together in exhibitions in a bid to help pave the way for same-sex pairs to compete officially.Scott Moir, Canada’s triple world ice dance champion, has argued for the inclusion of same-sex partnerships, partly because it provides more opportunities for female skaters who face a shortage of male partners in the sport.Explore more on these topicsSportLGBTQ+ rightsFigure skatingnewsShareReuse this content"

However, it marks a sea change for retailers accustomed to paying search engines to promote their listings.LLMs allow users to ask questions in conversational language, perhaps by speaking into their computer or phone. Instead of just providing a list of links, they offer specific suggestions with the potential for big sales for items that are regularly recommended.The chatbots produce their responses by scraping the internet and inbuilt datasets for relevant information, with some sources given more trusted status than others.Companies large and small are scrambling to adapt to this new world where the keywords and advertising deals previously central to web marketing hold less importance than the reviewers’ opinions, accurate availability information and product details read by LLMs such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini and Meta’s Llama.The shake-up may create an opening for independent businesses to cut through online, but some big brands are concerned they will be lost in a wild west where it is unclear how to reach the consumer. Marketers must now appeal not only to shoppers directly but also to their AI bots.“Retailers can’t buy their way into the search – they have to earn it,” says Emma Ford, the director of digital transformation for PwC UK. “The experience, expertise, authenticity and trustworthiness [of a brand online] help. Sentiment across the internet is really important.”Several large UK retailers have told the Guardian they already have teams on the case looking at a wide variety of tactics, from making sure they appear in Reddit forums – akey source for some platforms– to responding to reviews on Google or Trustpilot, and ensuring AI models can access the correct product data.While some say they are being cautious with resources, amid signs certain individual LLMs could disappear as rapidly as they have sprung up, the belief is that this new way of interacting online is here to stay.Nickyl Raithatha, the chief executive of the online card and gift seller Moonpig, says AI search’s relevance for companies this year is relatively low but his company iswell-prepared for rapid change.He says Moonpig is ensuring its products are picked up in AI search by using generative engine optimisation (GEO) techniques such as “online content with people discussing the best way to make someone happy on Mothers Day” in its own content or on discussions boards and in YouTube videos. He adds: “There is a growing science around this and we are all learning.”Ford says businesses are still feeling their way into the nuances of how the technology will find and respond to their online presence. Online reviews, for example, are clearly a factor in AI decision-making, but it is not clear how much importance is placed on particular platforms or how they rank against other factors such as reliable availability data, longevity of a brand or secure payment options.It may be that suppliers that have been around longer and have a broader profile are foregrounded, but their long history of ups and downs could also play against them.“I do think AI will change retail for the next 20 years,” says Peter Ruis, the managing director of John Lewis. He contends that established brands such as his will benefit from having a strong reputation with the technology in place to sell online, while shoppers could discover they stock items previously assumed to have been available only at a specialist.In future, industry watchers believe, ChatGPT, Amazon and Google are likely to try to monetise their AI platforms with some form of paid search or featured ads.More sophisticated “AI agent” models are also being developed – bots that can autonomously perform complex multistage tasks such as seeking out the best deals, placing orders and organising delivery.For example, it could be possible for these digital secretaries to negotiate offers tailored to particular customers, such as bundling together a number of furniture purchases from various outlets during a move, which have been customised to fit budget, style and delivery preferences, according to the advisory firm McKinsey.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThat could lead retailers into allowing their systems to flex product prices to attract particular searchers.Organising the return of an unwanted item could also be taken on by AI agents, with one acting on behalf of the shoppers and the other for the retailer.However, such technology is fraught with potential pitfalls. Retailers will need systems that can cope with a potential flurry of queries and to have clear rules on who might be responsible for glitches such as unwanted purchases made by a bot.In the US, the online marketplace Etsy was the first toteam up with ChatGPTto make it possible to pay for goods via the LLM’s instant checkout service. The e-commerce platform Shopify and the retailers Walmart and Target swiftly followed. While the deals do not appear to prioritise their products in searches, the inclusion of a “buy” button for their goods could put them ahead of the pack.Anna Bancroft, a partner in PwC’s digital transformation team, points out that under current UK rules it is not possible for an AI bot to make a purchase on behalf of a human, and regulation would need to change for such systems to run without human oversight. She says retailers and shoppers are cautious about giving the robots access to customer data and handling payment.There are also concerns about agents being susceptible to manipulation, as Microsoft has found inresearch simulations. Meanwhile, tech retail players are becoming territorial about who gets to crawl whose data.Last month, Amazonsued the AI company Perplexityover its shopping feature that automates placing orders for users. Amazon accused the startup of covertly accessing customer accounts and disguising AI activity as human browsing. Perplexityhit back, defending users’ right to delegate their shopping to AI agents and calling the suit “a bully tactic to suppress competition”.In this rapidly shifting landscape, Ford suggests independent retailers may have a chance to shine. “Independents have potential to go faster,” she says, with the ability to respond nimbly without having to sign off large budgets.Michelle Ovens, the founder of Small Business Britain, which advises independent retailers on how to survive on the changing high street, agrees. “[Independent businesses] don’t necessarily need to spend a lot of money. You don’t necessarily need a big team,” she says.Ovens advises local shopkeepers to ask AI platforms themselves how best to make sure they can appear. “Be clear about who you are,” she says, with a description making clear that you are an independent specialist, up-to-date pictures and “encourage customers who have got experience of the brand to give a good review”.However, all of this should not stand ahead of making a website engaging and easy to shop on, Ovens adds. “There will not be a dramatic shift this Christmas. We’ll see change over time and operators will rise to the challenge.”Explore more on these topicsRetail industryArtificial intelligence (AI)ShoppingOnline shoppingConsumer affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For others, it provides their children with an essential line to friends, family, connection and support.When Australia’s social media ban came into effect on Wednesday, millions of under-16s lost access to their accounts and were prevented from creating new ones.Guardian Australia has spent the past year reporting on the ban, how it will be implemented and potential unintended consequences.

More than 9 million Australians use Pinterest each month.Wednesday’s report found searches for 1980s luxury soared by 225%, “Scotland Highlands aesthetic” by 465% and “the poet aesthetic” by 175%. “Poetcore” – a key trend for Gen Z and millennials - takes its inspiration from the bookish: turtlenecks, fountain pens, satchels and ties.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Eugenio Marongiu/Getty Images/Image SourceView image in fullscreenWill millenials be going poetcore in 2026?Photograph: Alexander Spatari/Getty ImagesDriven by Gen Z and millennials, lace will be in, according to the data, including in doily, bandana and makeup form – as will khaki, field jackets and pleated trousers, aka the “paleontologist aesthetic”.They’ll also be working an intergalactic “aliencore aesthetic”.For Gen Z and millennials, travel will be adrenaline-seeking; for baby boomers, it will be to places that are “mystical” and “ethereal”.

A younger trend for a “gummy bears aesthetic” goes beyond sweets and into makeup products and rubberised nail art.And “niche perfume collection” is having its moment in the sun, as are “perfume layering combinations”.Pinterest said there was a theme uniting trends as disparate as masquerades and operas, dragonfly wing-patterned nails and animal-inspired outfits, forecasting a move towards individuality and away from imitation.View image in fullscreenThe future is now for devotees of aliencore aesthetics.Photograph: Jacob Wackerhausen/Getty ImagesMelinda Petrunoff, the managing director for Pinterest ANZ, told Guardian Australia that “people are craving comfort, authenticity and grounded optimism in a world that feels increasingly fast and often noisy”.“What’s driving this is a desire for individuality and self-preservation – people are moving towards curating rather than copying, choosing to engage with what truly resonates with them instead of chasing every viral moment,” she said.“We’re moving away from one-size-fits-all aesthetics and endless trend cycles that leave people feeling overwhelmed and disconnected.”Explore more on these topicsPinterestSocial mediaShareReuse this content"

Though the labor and delivery staff caring for her expected her to have a smooth delivery, her case presented complications almost immediately.The woman, who was born in central Asia, checked into the hospital with a smartwatch on her wrist, said two hospital workers who cared for her during her labor, and whom the Guardian is not identifying to avoid exposing their hospital or patients to retaliation.The device was not an ordinary smartwatch made by Apple or Samsung, but a special type that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had mandated the woman wear at all times, allowing the agency to track her. The device was beeping when she entered the hospital, indicating she needed to charge it, and she worried that if the battery died, ICE agents would think she was trying to disappear, the hospital workers recalled. She told them that, just days earlier, she had been put on a deportation flight to Mexico, but the pilot refused to let her fly because she was so close to giving birth.The woman’s fear only grew from there, according to the hospital workers. Her delivery wasn’t progressing the way the care team hoped, and she needed a C-section, a procedure that requires doctors to use a cauterizing tool to minimize bleeding. To prevent possible burning and electrocution, patients are instructed to take off all jewelry or metals before the surgery. The mandatory watch had no way to be easily removed, nor was information about whether it would be safe to wear during the procedure readily available. Hospital staff didn’t know how to contact ICE to ask what to do. When hospital staff told the woman they might have to cut the smartwatch off, she panicked, the workers said.Staff eventually did remove the device, and ICE agents did not show up at the hospital during the delivery. The nurses said they do not know what happened to the woman after she left the hospital with her baby.The woman was one of three pregnant patients wearing a location-tracking smartwatch whom these two workers encountered in their ER in the last few months, they said.BI Inc and alternative to detentionThe watches are built and operated by BI Inc, a company specializing in monitoring tech that runs the US government’s largest immigrant surveillance operation. The program, Alternative to Detention (ATD), allows select immigrants to await their day in court at home rather than in detention, provided they subscribe to intense monitoring.When immigrants are enrolled in ATD, they are assigned one or more types of supervision. Some have to wear an ankle monitor, some a smartwatch. Some are required to complete regularly scheduled facial recognition scans at their home using a BI Inc app, while others are mandated to go into a BI Inc or ICE office for regular in-person check-ins.The smartwatch, officially called the VeriWatch, was introduced two years ago by BI Inc. It was first piloted under the Biden administration and framed as a more discreet alternative to the less digitally equipped ankle monitor, which BI also manufactures and supplies to ICE. As theGuardian previously reported, immigrants wearing the ankle monitors have complained about the stigma that comes with wearing the conspicuous device as well as physical pain caused by the monitors, including electric shocks and cuts from devices that are strapped on too tightly.Nearly 200,000 people are currently enrolled in the program, and many of them have become increasingly fearful of being considered out of compliance as the Trump administration works to deport immigrants en masse. There have beenseveral casesofpeople in the programshowing up to a mandated, regular in-person check-in with immigration officials, believing they will continue in the ATD program, only to be detained.All three women encountered by theColoradohospital staff were reluctant to take their monitors off, fearing that doing so would trigger an alert to ICE or BI Inc, the staff said, even if removing the device was deemed medically necessary.One of the women went into the ER for a C-section and was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia, a complication that can cause significant swelling. Staff were worried her smartwatch would cut off her circulation.“She was in tears about it. She had this deep fear that ICE was going to come to the hospital and take her baby,” one of the staff said. The hospital worker’s shift ended before the patient underwent the C-section. They said they do not know whether the staff who took over the patient’s case convinced her to cut off the watch.The confusion and fear surrounding the wrist monitor caused delays in the hospital’s ability to provide adequate and necessary care for these women, the workers said, though the patients delivered their babies safely.“Waiting and trying to figure these things out even when things are not super emergent can cause something emergent to happen,” one of the workers said. “Sometimes in birth, doing a C-section 20 minutes before something bad happens can prevent it.”The workers pointed out that when they treat patients wearing a monitor issued by the state department of corrections, there is a protocol in place to remove it before medical procedures.Trump’s chaotic crackdownHospital staff from across the US who spoke to the Guardian say the confusion brought on by monitoring devices is just one of several ways Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown is affecting medical care, and comes as immigrant patients are increasingly fearful of seeking out treatment.One of the staff at the Colorado hospital said she’s had at least three pregnant patients show up for their first-ever prenatal appointment between 34 and 38 weeks – well into their third trimester and long after pregnant women are recommended to begin going to consistent doctor appointments.InCalifornia, hospital workers have also noticed a drop this year in immigrants not just seeking emergency care but also showing up for regular doctor visits or vaccinations, according to the California Nurses Association president, Sandy Reding.“Obviously it has a cascading effect,” Reding said. “If you don’t see your doctor regularly then the outcomes are worse and you wait until you have a crisis to go to the ER.”In Chicago, CommunityHealth, one of the largest volunteer-based health centers in the country,documentedan overall drop in visits per patient and patient retention between 2024 and 2025 due to immigration enforcement activity in the city. In June, the organization observed a 30% dip in patients showing up for their appointments and around a 40% drop in patients picking up their medication since Trump took office.Neither ICE nor BI Inc responded to requests for comment. ICEpreviouslytold the Guardian that there is no evidence the ankle monitors have caused physical harm and that the ATD program was effective at increasing court appearance rates among immigrants facing removal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In one July 2025 case, ICE responded to a man’s request to remove his ankle monitor because of a medical issue by detaining him, according to a court petition filed on his behalf by immigrant rights group Amica, which the Guardian reviewed.The man came to the US from Bangladesh to seek political asylum, and was told he had to wear an ankle monitor while his claim was pending. Suffering from nerve damage in one leg, he obtained a note from a medical clinic requesting the monitor be removed. His lawyer sent the note to the ICE officer on the case but never heard back. During his first check-in at the BI offices, the man brought the medical note to the BI Inc employee assigned to the case, who suggested the man might be able to move the ankle monitor to his other leg. But after the man’s lawyer called ICE to inquire about moving the ankle monitor, the BI case manager informed the man that ICE officers were coming to the BI office to speak with him. They arrested and detained the man, according to the petition.“He explained that he was just asking for the ankle monitor to be put on the other leg, and the officer told him it was ‘too late’,” the petition reads.In 2009, ICEdiscontinuedthe use of ankle monitors for pregnant women and people whose medical conditions made it “inappropriate” to wear them. But former BI Inc staff as well as immigrants rights groups Amica and American Friends Service Committee said they are concerned that these exceptions are not always enforced. That exception also doesn’t apply to smartwatches, a June 2025 ICE memo shows.The ICE memo instructs agency staffers to put ankle monitors on anyone enrolled in ATD. Dawnisha M Helland, an ICE acting assistant director in the management of non-detained immigrants, wrote that the only group who would not be given ankle monitors were pregnant women. Instead, pregnantwomen in ATD would wear the smartwatch.Though it resembles a typical consumer smartwatch, the VeriWatch is not less restrictive than the ankle monitor. Like the ankle monitor, the wrist watch can’t be removed by the person wearing it. ICE had the option of using a removable version of the watch, according to a 2023request for informationDHS published. The agency chose a different direction; it currently only uses a watch that cannot be removed except by an ICE or authorized BI agent, according to two former DHS officials and two former BI employees.Immigrants in the program are not told what to do with their ankle or wrist monitors in case of medical emergencies, and BI staff were not authorized to approve the removal of the monitors without first speaking to ICE, the two former BI Inc staff members recalled.There’s not always time in emergency cases to wait for approval from ICE to cut off the monitors, the Colorado hospital workers said. One of the Colorado staff said they’re deeply concerned about how this unremovable watch will continue to impact vulnerable pregnant women.“They’re looking at people who literally can’t speak up, who have no legal resources, who are not American citizens, and are pregnant. They’re asking themselves what they can get away with in terms of violating civil liberties for these patients,” the employee said. “That’s the true pilot program: how far can they overreach?”Internal alarmHealthcare workers are not the only ones sounding the alarm over surveillance’s interference with medical care. Two former Department of Homeland Security officials told the Guardian that the lack of protocols for immigrants surveilled under ATD with exigent medical issues is a symptom of a larger issue with the way BI Inc and ICE run the program. As the Guardianpreviously reported, immigrants surveilled under ATD and BI Inc employees alike have long complained that the program is highly discretionary. They said that many of the decisions about how, why or how long a given person was mandated to wear an ankle monitor or a smartwatch was left to individual caseworkers.BI Inc, which started off as a cattle monitoring company, and its parent company the Geo Group, which develops detention centers, private prisons and rehabilitation facilities, have been given the exclusive DHS contract to operate all aspects of the ATD program since its inception in 2004. That’sdespite previous attemptsby ICE leadership under Joe Biden’s administration to break the contract up into three parts rather than awarding the entirety of the contract to Geo Group, a company that has served as alanding spotfor former ICE and DHS officials.At its peak, BI Inc monitored approximately 370,000 immigrants under the Biden administration as part of apolicythat put everyhead of householdcrossing the border on ATD. The tally decreased in 2025 to about 180,000 people, due in part to high costs of putting so many people on ATD, former DHS officials said. As Trump’s second administration supercharged immigration enforcement and greenlit a $150bn surge in funding for ICE, though, Geo Groupexecutives expressedconfidence they could reach the same height by the second half of 2025. The goal, the executives have said, is to monitor all 7.5 million people listed on the federal government’s non-detained docket, the list of non-citizens who have not been detained but are subject to removal.However, the Trump administration has focused on deportation and detention rather than monitoring, and the number of immigrants enrolled in ATD and wearing ankle monitors or other GPS tracking devices has hovered around 180,000, much to the dismay of Geo Group executives.“Now the count has been fairly stable, which is a little disappointing, obviously,” George Zoley, the GEO Group founder and executive chair of the board, said during the company’s Novemberearnings call.ICE awarded another two-year-contract to BI Inc to manage ATD inSeptember. Executives have said they’re pleased that the agency is prioritizing using the company’s more expensive ankle monitors on those immigrants already in ATD rather than the more cost-effective tools like the company’s facial recognition app, Smart Link.Under the Biden administration, several departments within DHSattempted to address the lackof consistent policy around how ICE should run ATD. In December 2022, DHShosted100 non-governmental organizations as well as members of academia and private industry to discuss how to bring more “uniform standards to govern” ATD. That two-year effort to draft guidelines in a document, initially titled Non-Detained Management Standards, was ultimately scuttled by ICE and BI, said Scott Shuchart, a former assistant director for regulatory affairs and police at ICE under the Biden administration. Another former DHS official confirmed his account. The draft standards were never made public.“The program is really structured for the benefit of BI and not for the benefit of the non-citizens who were going to be managed through it,” said Shuchart. “Therefore ERO [ICE’s enforcement and removal arm] was extremely resistant to bring rationalization and consistent policy into it.”Explore more on these topicsTechnologyMigrationSurveillancePregnancySmartwatchesWest CoastUS immigrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereNaomi AldermanWed 10 Dec 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 10.02 ESTShareAfew days ago, I clicked a button on my phone to send funds to a company in Singapore and so took ownership of the video game I co-created and am lead writer for:Zombies, Run!I am a novelist, I wrote the bestselling, award-winning The Power, which was turned into an Amazon Prime TV series starring Toni Collette. What on earth am I doing buying a games company?Well. First of all.Zombies, Run! is special. It’s special to me – the game started as a Kickstarter and the community that grew up around it has always been incredibly supportive of what we’re doing. And it’s special in what it does. It’s a game to exercise with. You play it on your smartphone – iPhone or Android – and we tell stories from the zombie apocalypse in your headphones to encourage you to go further, faster, or just make exercise less boring. Games are so often portrayed as the bad entertainment form, but I made a game that fundamentally helps people to be healthier.The experience of playing Zombies, Run! is also completely focused on storytelling. My co-creator Adrian Hon and I were talking about doing a project together. He said: “Let’s do something to make running more fun.” I said: “How about if we do a story where you’re being chased by zombies?” And here we are.When you play the game, you’re immersed in a world where every run makes you a hero – you’re collecting supplies, saving a child from no man’s land, investigating the mystery of how the apocalypse started. I’ve always focused on the storytelling being good. And it works. Players of the game become so attached to the characters that many of them report laughing out loud or even “crying while running”.One of my jokes about storytelling in video games is that the way we tend to talk about it – in the games industry, in games journalism, even in marketing copy – is very much “never mind the quality, feel the width”. We say things like “this game has 100-plus hours of story” or “this game contains more than a million words”. Imagine marketing a movie saying that the script contains 29,000 words. Or selling a novel on the basis that it’ll take a long time to read.View image in fullscreenChasing the narrative … Zombies, Run!Illustration: Simon Garbutt/Zombies Run! LtdThat’s not how you do it. You tell the story. You give a hook. You say: “A single woman comes home one evening to find a man claiming to be her husband living in her house. And when he goes up to the attic, a different husband comes down in his place.” Now you can’t wait to find out what happens next. (That, incidentally, is the brilliant comic novelThe Husbands by Holly Gramazio– who I think is the only other bestselling novelist to be also making her own video games.)So, now I own a games company, what am I going to do? My feeling is that I must focus on the fundamentals. There’s a world of games out there that thinks it can replace writers with AI large language models. I think that’s going to make writing worse and worse. AI writing is fine for boilerplate text that is always roughly the same. It’s fine for non-writers to get their expertise into the world. But storytelling is different. It is human minds finding companionship with other human minds – we need stories, fundamentally, to feel less alone. To know that other people have been through things a bit like what we have. Things that make us laugh, and cry, even while running. You get that from work that is not the same as everything else, you get it from the unique work of other individual human minds.And actually, Zombies, Run! has always been a universe with strong values. We’re not a rightwing, rugged-individualism apocalypse, where one lone person can get through with just their guns. In our world – as in the real world – humans survive by working together.While we’re still going to have many exciting fleeing zombies, battling-the-undead storytelling, I think there’s probably also room in the ZR! universe for a 10-mission arc where you have to find all the figurines and paints you need to complete an expansion set in “Demons and Darkness”; or one where you’re working on bringing an overgrown garden back to blooming, beautiful life; or setting up and running the first post-apocalyptic travelling library while also trying to work out what happened to the first librarian who’s mysteriously disappeared, leaving only a series of cryptic notes in an old manuscript.After all, I do think this is quite a good time in the world to be thinking about how to rebuild after a series of catastrophic events.Selling story by the yard and not by a story hook is a marker, I think, of a lack of confidence in the form. We don’t need to lack confidence. Games arethe biggest entertainment industryin the world. If we want to be taken seriously, we need to take ourselves seriously. Stop talking about the width, start talking about the quality.What to playView image in fullscreenShoot everything that moves … Evil Egg.Photograph: Ivy SlyIt was the 20th anniversary of Xbox 360 recently, and one name that’s cropped up in every list of the console’s best games is the compulsive retro twin-stick shooter Geometry Wars. If you’re yearning for something similar, you must immediately downloadEvil Egg, a frenzied twin-stick blaster with gorgeous Commodore 64-style visuals and sound effects. Shoot everything that moves, hit the left trigger to boost and collect hearts to stay alive.At first it’s a bewildering mass of rainbow pixels but as you detonate wave after wave of glitchy space pests, you begin to understand the patterns of different enemies and earn upgrades such as the executioner’s sword, which takes out foes in an orbital slash of laser particles. Evil Egg is polished, exciting, wild to look at, and has such a brilliant understanding of the genre and its unique dynamics. It’s free on Steam but I implore you todownload it on Itch.ioand name your own price.Keith StuartAvailable on:PCEstimated playtime:10-plus hoursskip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I particularly enjoyedthis postby writer Harper Jay MacIntyre, which considers Horses, formalism and the trans experience. The article manages to bring in so many elements of modern games criticism and academia while providing a highly personal response to the game.The most interesting retro game articles are the ones that reassess lost or derided titles rather than merely celebrate the classics. Was the Atari 2600 version ofPac-Manthe worst game ever? Not according tothis compelling analysisfrom Garrett Martin at AV Club who sees it as a misunderstood brutalist gem.

Not just a lumberjack, Duffy also made waves on late-90s reality TV shows The Real World: Boston and Road Rules: All Stars. And now Duffy is parlaying his experience on Road Rules into his role as US transportation secretary.Duffy has got a lot on his big lumberjack hands: transport infrastructure in the US is, to use the technical term, a hot mess. More than a third of the country’sbridges need major repair workor replacement. There has been little historical investment in railways and the country lags behind the rest of the industrialized world when it comes tohigh-speed trains. Meanwhile, there’s a chronicair-traffic-controller shortage, which was exacerbated by the recent government shutdown when a number of controllers, fed up with the dysfunctional system, took earlyretirement.Don’t worry, though, Sean Dog is on the case! On Monday the transportation secretary held a flashypress conferencewith health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr at Washington DC’s Reagan national airport to talk about his plans to usher in a golden age of air travel. The pair didn’t spend much time on the boring ins and outs of air-traffic-controller recruitment, which Duffy has made afew movesto address elsewhere. Nor did they discussshrinking airplane seatsor junk fees that force you to pay more for basic things like seat selection. Instead, they did a lot of pull-ups for the camera. Duffy did 10 pull-ups. RFK Jr, who is 71 years old, did 20.I can’t think of anything more pleasant than ... [being] surrounded by travelers who just worked up a sweatWhy were we treated to this testosterone fest? Because Duffy has a plan to make air travel more pleasant – and has managed to conjure up $1bn in grant money to do so – seemingly by transforming airports into wellness spaces. “Maybe I want a workout area where people might get some blood flow doing some pull-ups or some step-ups in the airport,” the transport secretary mused.Paul Saladino, an influencer who has been a big believer in the “carnivore diet” andraw milk, was brought on to flesh out this plan. “What if we could create small spaces for Americans in airports to get mini workouts?” Saladino enthused. “Maybe some treadmills for people who want to walk near their gate … maybe some exercise bikes?”Why not indeed? I can’t think of anything more pleasant than cramming myself into a tiny seat in a crowded airplane surrounded by travelers who just worked up a sweat doing pre-flight push-ups.If the thought of stale sweat at 30,000ft doesn’t make you queasy, I have something else that might turn your stomach: RFK Jr payingtributeto “a mother’s breast”. The press conference touched on airports needing more breastfeeding spaces, which, to be fair, is a valid point. It’s just a shame Duffy and RFK Jr had to make it creepy andpronatalistby bringing on conservative podcaster Isabel Brown to talk about encouraging young women “to embrace the beauty of motherhood”.Duffy has plenty of ideas for upgrading air travel. Last month he unveiled acivility campaigncalled The Golden Age of Travel Starts With You. The website explains that it’s supposed to “jumpstart a nationwide conversation around how we can all restore courtesy and class to air travel”.If we’re going to have a conversation aboutcivility,any chance we can start with the people, I don’t know, running the country? Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, is constantly posting on X about “cucks” and telling journalists to “shut the fuck up”. And then there’s Potus himself. Trump recently called a journalist “piggy” during a press gaggle on Air Force One, which is certainly one way to jumpstart a nationwide conversation about restoring courtesy to air travel.Welcome on board this aircraft. Please return your seat to the upright position – for ever | Arwa MahdawiRead moreLikewise, Duffy has a sartorial vision for this golden age of air travel; he wants people to dress up for their basic-economy flights. In a press conference before Thanksgiving, Duffy urged flyers to “dress a little better”. Don’t ask how you’re supposed to simultaneously dress fancyanduse the airport as a workout space, by the way. On that he was unclear.I’m not the only skeptic: various TikTokers are wearingpyjamasto the airport in protest against governmental entreaties to dress better. Even the Magasphere thinks Duffy has some weird priorities. “I’m sick of people in government going: ‘Well, the golden age of travel starts with you. Dress up. Be courteous,’” rightwing podcaster Tim Dillonsaid on a recent episode. “Hey Sean, no one has any money. No one has any goddamn money, you fool.”Of course, that’s not entirely true. The ultra-wealthy are living in agolden ageof private air travel. And I’ve got a funny feeling that you’re not going to catch any of them doing pull-ups at the airport next to the likes of me and you.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionAir transportUS politicsRobert F Kennedy JrHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

Demob happy. A few minutes in to the year’s penultimate prime minister’s questions with MPs from both sides shouting and cheering, the speaker interrupted proceedings to say: “We don’t need the panto auditions any more.” To which the natural response was: “Ooh yes we do.” Because that’s pretty much the whole purpose ofPMQsat the best of times. A feelgood experience for some. A feelbad experience for others. Noise with no substance.No one embraces the panto spirit more thanKemi Badenoch. Kemi has come to realise that the bar is actually quite low for her to remain as Tory leader. All she has to do is be a little bit better than Keir Starmer at PMQs. Which is turning out to be a lot less difficult than she imagined. Sometimes just standing up is enough.Though being good at PMQs does nothing to shift the polls – the Tories are still tanking behind Labour – it does wonders for the morale of her backbenchers. And they are the men and women keeping her in a job. If you had suggested that Kemi might last longer than Keir just six months ago, you would have got long odds. But now she’s an odds on favourite. It’s still unlikely she will be Tory leader at the next election, but that’s a long way off. And Kemi isn’t that bothered. She’s happy to bank whatever wins she can get. For almost the first time in her life, her confidence is not entirely misplaced.Credit also to Kemi’s minders. Somehow they have managed to steer her away from her late-night browsing of far-right conspiracy theories on the dark web. Instead they have instructed here to try to keep it simple at PMQs. By all means adopt some cutesy Cinders panto repartee if you must. But play the questioning straight. Stick to the basics of, “how are things going?”. Because the reality is that most people think the answer is, “badly verging on terribly”. There’s only so long a prime minister can carry on blaming the other party. People expected things to have noticeably changed by now.So that’s what Kemi did. Took a few potshots at Starmer being a caretaker leader and then cherrypicked her way through areas of health, education, policing and energy on which Labour were weak. Job done. This was politics 101 for any opposition leader. Keir could only sound defensive in reply. Try to imply that Kemi’s job was also on the line when everyone knows it’s his backbenchers who are having the change of leadership chats. His cabinet ministers eyeing up the perfect time to make a move. The country doesn’t much care whether Kemi comes or goes. That’s her blessing and her curse.View image in fullscreenIf Keir couldn’t commit to closer economic ties with Europe, Ed doubted he would still be standing at the dispatch box this time next year.Photograph: House of Commons/PAStarmer could only hope for damage limitation. Some days you win, some you lose. This was always going to be one of the latter days. Right now Keir is living his worst life. Deep-rooted problems in the economy and his own party turning on him. Nothing to be done other than adopt full-on survival mode and hope to catch a break some time soon. As for this PMQs, it would soon be yesterday’s social media fodder. The Westminster bubble were the only people who cared and they would soon move on to the next crisis.But Keir did not come off unscathed. Though it wasn’t Kemi who inflicted the wounds that really hurt. It was the ever so polite Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader who would never resort to panto in the chamber, who cut Starmer to the quick. Kemi could not go near Donald Trump’s latest rants on Europe – she is far too invested in staying close to the far right in-crowd – but Davey could. And did. Why the silence on the new US security strategy? Did the prime minister appreciate the irony of Agent Orange talking about Europe trampling on democratic principles? Any comments on “civilisational erasure”?Nothing. Starmer couldn’t bring himself to say a word against the US president. Couldn’t believe that everyone who had told him The Donald was uber fickle and that his support could not be counted on were correct. Couldn’t defend Sadiq Khan from Trump’s grotesque racism. Would rather say nothing and let the Russians believe Europe was a pushover.Davey went on to ask about closer economic ties with the EU. If Keir couldn’t commit to that then Ed rather doubted the prime minister would still be standing at the dispatch box this time next year.Et tu, Ed?He could take that sort of line from Kemi any day of the week. She calls for him to resign almost on a daily basis. Sometimes twice on the same day for different things. Keir is often unsure whether he is meant to unresign and then resign again. But to hear it from Gentleman Ed was too much to bear. More in sorrow than in anger.It wasn’t just Starmer who was having a bad day.Rachel Reeveshad her own ordeal to face in the guise of a 90-minute appearance before the Treasury select committee to answer questions on the budget. The main focus was on the process. How come so much of the budget was leaked in advance? In fact all of it, even down to the bits that had been planned and then dropped. It had been as if the whole country had been on a Zoom call with Starmer and Reeves during the build up.Keir Starmer appoints 25 Labour peers in bid to strengthen support in House of LordsRead moreRachel was horrified by all the leaks. No one was more horrified than her. It turned out there were key differences between leaks and briefings. Briefings were leaks that were authorised. Leaks were unauthorised leaks. Though it was all so long ago she couldn’t remember which bits were leaks and which bits were briefings. So she would be setting up an inquiry to investigate which leaks she had leaked and which she had briefed. Confused? She was. But the inquiry would run in parallel to the one Keir was conducting into what Keir had leaked to the media about the leadership challenge leaks.Thankfully for Rachel, the questioning moved on to growth. It was there even if you can’t measure it, she said. It was just her luck to have delivered a budget that had proved a big hit with both her leftwing backbenchers and the financial markets, but been rubbished by almost everyone else.

But suddenly they are up in arms because the Washington Postreportedon 28 November about one incident, a double-tap strike, in which the US military finished off two survivors of an attack.Tempted as I am to accept whatever it takes to spark some minimal scrutiny of these summary executions, I hope this unexpected opening promptsbroaderinvestigation of this entire series of murders, which have nowclaimed87 victims in 22 attacks. As Democratsjoinin, there are someindicationsthat this expanded scrutiny may be finally beginning.The reason for the congressional awakening is the revelation that during thefirststrike on 2 September, the US military initially killednineoccupants of a boat but then returned to kill two men clinging to the remains of the destroyed boat. These two clearly posed no threat to anyone. The Pentagon has advanced no evidence to support itsclaimthat they might have been trying to radio their compatriots. Admiral Frank “Mitch” Bradley, who was overseeing the operation,acknowledgedthat the two men were in no position to make a distress call.Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House armed services committee, who has seen the still-withheld full video of the attack, said there wasno evidenceto support the claim that the survivors were trying to contact their collaborators. Representative Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee,saidthe two survivors “were barely alive, much less engaging in hostilities”, when the follow-up strike took place.The Pentagon has alsofallen backon the claim that the two were trying torightthe remains of the boat that might have still contained cocaine. But the stricken boat was clearly going nowhere and could easily have been intercepted. There was no need to kill the two men clinging to its wreckage.In an armed conflict, it is a war crime to attack people who have beenshipwreckedat sea, as some in Congress haveallegedhappened. They are consideredhors de combat– outside the fight – and hence no longer combatants who can be shot on sight. They are akin to wounded or surrendering combatants. Opposing forces have adutyto receive and care for them,notkill them.But the United States is not in an armed conflict with the alleged drug cartels that Trump is targeting. Despite the rhetoric being bandied about, there can be no war crime if there is no war. But there can still bemurder, which these attacks were. So were every one of the other killings at sea that Trump and Hegseth have ordered.Drug cartels are criminal networks. The US Coast Guard has a longhistoryof interdicting such boats and arresting participants for prosecution. That is a law-enforcement operation. International human rights law strictlylimitswhen such an operation can use lethal force – only as a last resort to avoid an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury. Except in the most dire circumstances, we want police presenting people for trial, where they can contest the evidence against them before an independent judge and jury. We do not want a police officer on the beat to serve as the judge, jury and executioner.Trump sought to evade that requirement bydeclaringan “armed conflict”. Under international humanitarian law governing armed conflicts, enemy combatants who are not trying to surrender or are otherwise hors de combat can be summarily shot. There is no duty to try to detain them.But the existence of an armed conflict is not a subjective phenomenon dependent on the whims of a national leader, let alone one so prone to flights of fantasy as Trump. It is an objective inquiry,requiringsustained hostilities between two organized armed forces.The drug cartels being attacked by Trump are not at war with the United States. They are not shooting at the boats and drones hunting them down. To be sure, they are often trying to move cocaine and other drugs to the United States, which brings its own dangers, but that is not an armed conflict. Indeed, US law does not evenimposethe death penalty for drug trafficking, yet Trump is summarily executing these suspects without bothering to present evidence against them and allowing them to defend themselves in court.For Trump to be able toconcoctan armed conflict out of thin air is extraordinarily dangerous. If these suspected drug runners can be summarily executed upon Trump’s mere assertion of a war against them, he could do the same to kill off anyone – shoplifters, jaywalkers, or even anti-Trump protesters. The national guard whom Trump isdeployingto Democratic-run cities could be the agents.The precedent set would compound the dangers. Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping could declare a fake “war” to assassinate their own dissidents, whether at home or in exile. The most fundamental human right –the right to life– would be rendered meaningless.By all means, Congress should challenge Trump about the blatant illegality of the 2 September double-tap strike. That wasmurder, plain and simple. But the other 85 people who have been killed during the attacks on suspected drug boats since early September were also murdered. ThesecretDepartment of Justice memo approving these attacks reportedlyrelieson little more than Trump’s assertions, which may explain why the administration hasrefusedto release it.It is understandably difficult to defend drug suspects. They are not the most sympathetic of victims, even if the men taking these dangerous boat rides are far from the kingpins running the cartels. But the stakes are more profound. There is no rule of law if the president can deem anyone an enemy combatant and order them summarily shot. Political leaders should stand for more than merely continuing in office whatever the price. If there is ever a time for Republicans in Congress to risk a Trump-inspired primary challenge, this is it.Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch (1993-2022), is a visiting professor at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs.

The relatively short document oozes Trump and Trumpism. It starts out with the typically modest claim that the president has brought “our nation – and the world – back from the brink of catastrophe and disaster”.Even if the strategy mostly formalises the ongoing actions and statements of Trump and his administration, it should be heeded as a warning for the world, andEuropein particular.The document espouses an aggressive form of foreign-policy interference in which the US explicitly sets itself the goal of “promoting European greatness”. Its language could have been directly lifted fromViktor Orbán’s speeches during the so-called refugeecrisis of 2015-16: “We want Europe to remain European, to regain its civilisational self-confidence.” Even more ominously, the document claims that Europe’s “economic decline is eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilisational erasure”.The whole section on Europe is steeped in decades of European far-right ideology and propaganda. The EU and migration policies are held responsible for “transforming the continent and creating strife, censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition, cratering birthrates, and loss of national identities and self-confidence”. According to the document, if “present trends continue, the continent will be unrecognisable in 20 years or less. As such, it is far from obvious whether certain European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to remain reliable allies”. Indeed, theTrump administrationbelieves that “within a few decades at the latest, certain Nato members will become majority non-European”.Expanding on this theme in an interview withPolitico, Trump claimed this would make these countries “much weaker”.These are arguments that have strong overtones of two theories regarded as foundational for contemporary far-right circles. The first is Oswald Spengler’sThe Decline of the West, whose thesis on the cyclical decline of civilisations was used by the German far right to criticise the “perversion” and “weakness” of the democratic Weimar republic. The second is The Great Replacement, published in 2011, by the French novelist Renaud Camus, whotranslated long-existing“native” fears into a more explicit conspiracy theory, accusing European elites of using immigration to replace the rebellious “native” populations and import a more docile and dependent electorate. In the past decade, the “great replacement”conspiracy theoryhas become mainstream within US rightwing circles through people such as Steve Bannon andTucker Carlson.It is the nativist fever dream encapsulated in both ideas that gives the Trump administration the right, if not the duty, to intervene in European affairs, the document implies: “American diplomacy should continue to stand up for genuine democracy, freedom of expression, and unapologetic celebrations of European nations’ individual character and history.” And it is clear where it sees its allies: “America encourages its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit, and the growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for great optimism.”In other words, the US believes that it is key to its national security to “Make Europe great again”, and that the European far right is the only political force that can achieve this. Consequently, its “broad policy for Europe” prioritises “cultivating resistance to Europe’s current trajectory within European nations” (read: the far right) and “building up the healthy nations of central, eastern, and southern Europe” – in particular “aligned countries that want to restore their former greatness” (read: Hungary, Italy).While the document remains vague about how it will achieve this, it is clear that a priority of the Trump administration is to put pressure on Europe to adopt a radical policy around freedom of speech, closer to that which prevails in the US – again, particularly towards far-right speech – and not just on social media. Another is to normalise Russia; or, as the document calls it, to “reestablish strategic stability with Russia”. Although the country is not explicitly called a future ally, the Trump administration clearlydoes not treatRussia as an adversary either.In a broader sense, the national security strategy takes its inspiration less from the glorified US of the 1950s, often assumed to be the ideal behind the “Make America great again” slogan, than theMonroe doctrineof 1823. Articulated by President James Monroe, this warned European powers not to interfere in the “western hemisphere” (ie the Americas), which he declared to be the US’s sphere of interest.The Trump administration’s policy document promises to “assert and enforce” a “Trump corollary” to the Monroe doctrine which involves the US “enlisting” countries around the world that want to help safeguard US national interests.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But perhaps now that it is published in an official document, European leaders will finally understand that “daddy”is serious. And, if the document is too long or vague for them, let me summarise it in terms that are clear and concise: the current US government believes that its national security is best served by the destruction of liberal democracy in Europe. In other words, the US is not (just) an unwilling ally, it is a willing adversary.

There’s nothing I like more than submerging myself in a subject area for a couple of weeks, grabbing as many stories as I can, and then turning to my friends and saying, “Did you know …”If this makes me sound insufferable, it’s because I probably am, but at least I make up for it by providing little anecdotes about the life of Ludwig von Köchel, the man who invented the system for organising the music of Mozart (he was also an accomplished botanist). It doesn’t even really matterwhatthe area of interest is. Over the course of a couple of weeks this year, I read back to back biographies about Malcolm X before discovering the Swedish band Bob Hund, who sing exclusively in a language I don’t speak, and who I could now deliver a short-ish university lecture on, if anyone was interested (my email’s available on my website).Sure, people tell you about sleepless nights. But why does no one mention the hell that is a parent WhatsApp group? | Sean SzepsRead moreThe reason for these scattershot research areas is because I am not really addicted to acquiring knowledge, though that’s a nice bonus. I am addicted, rather, to the high of realising just how much I don’t know. The thrill that drives me happensbeforeI buy the biography or delve into the article. It’s the thrill of coming face-to-face with my own ignorance and watching the horizons of the world suddenly and dramatically expand. In short: when I realise I don’t have a clue, the landscape of my life gets bigger.For some time, I thought this high was exclusively to be found in bookish pursuits. And then I started to run.Running tends to get characterised as an entirely physical pursuit, which is probably why I avoided it for so long. But although I can feel drastic changes in my body since I started running pretty much every day, much more notable are the ways it has drawn me into closer acquaintance with my own mind: with my own ignorance.Almost every single run, there comes a point when I think to myself,I literally cannot run any more. That point shifts deeper into the run every single time, but it does always come. I’m not sure I’ll ever really be able to escape it. It’s as inevitable as death or taxes and it has the sort of grim, insisting finality of both. When the thought hits me, it feels absolute, and every single muscle in my body saystime to stop then, I guess.But, almost immediately, another thought invariably creeps into my head. It says:I bet you can keep going. And suddenly I am filled with the realisation that what I had previously considered true is not; that I spend a lot of life unaware not only of vast swathes of beauty and research that are only a book away but also of my own capabilities. Because time after time, Icankeep running.The generational divide is so overrated – here’s how I crossed it and forged new friendships | Zoya PatelRead moreWe do not live in a world where ignorance is well regarded. It’s often described as the reason why the world is shifting dangerously towards the far right; for our growing societal callousness. Furthermore, in the age of AI, everyone is expected to have the answer for everything; to be completely informed on every matter. But if there’s one thing that running has taught me, it’s that certainty not only shrinks the world: it can also resemble a kind of death. If you are certain that you cannot run, you will not run.By contrast, saying, “I don’t know” is not a failure. It’s a way of gesturing out to a horizon that goes on forever: picking a point in the distance of total, supreme knowledge that, thankfully, we will never actually be able to reach. A point that, if we want to, we can run towards every single day, the sound of a Swedish rock band ringing in our ears.Joseph Earp is a critic, painter and novelist.

But it’s a startZoe WilliamsWe need people from Europe to move to the UK – but also a way to give Brits the opportunity to build the futures they craveWed 10 Dec 2025 12.01 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 18.14 ESTShareAnnouncing her new Youth Matters plan – £500m to “boost resilience and teach skills” – the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, spoke of a “violent indifference” from the political establishment towards young people that had been going on “for decades”. She’s not wrong. We can look at all of the ways in which young people have seen their economic prospects and work opportunities systematically destroyed – and see that they all date from 2010.First, the tripling of the tuition fee cap saddled them with debts that have become astronomical, particularly for degrees that are socially beneficial, such as medicine and nursing; this, incidentally, from a coalition in which one partyexplicitly promisednever to do that. Yet for all its boldness in setting fire to manifesto promises and playing fast and loose with a generation’s future, the tuition fees policy didn’t actually deliver a sustainable funding plan for tertiary education – instead leaving it to cross-subsidise with foreign students, whom the political establishment has spent the past five yearstrying to chase out of the country.Then,Brexitremoved young people’s freedom of movement, while making their country permanently poorer. I didn’t vote for that, but at least Icouldhave; I cannot imagine the indignation I’d feel if I’d been under 18 for the referendum and still had to deal with its consequences every day, while simultaneously being told that it was my fault the “red wall” was angry, because I was too woke.Political cliche offers us a simple explanation: old people vote, young people don’t, therefore the old are rigorously prioritised, whether by the benefits system with the triple-lock, or the political culture, which puts their abstract notions of sovereignty and amorphous concerns about Britishness above anything an 18-year-old might think about finding a bar job in Split.To accept that, though, is to accept that politics has been profoundly debased; the principle that each new generation should have it better than the last was what the whole thing was supposed to be all about. To casually replace that with a presumption of electoral self-interest above all is not just cynical and narrow, it freezes the discourse in a perpetual, circular present, with MPs fighting to retain their power for no better reason than that their power is retained.It’s only when organisations pop up and advocate for the young that you realise how rare that now is. This morning the cross-party UK Trade and Business Commissionproduced a reportrecommending terms for a time-limited youth experience scheme, capped at 44,000 visas in the first year. They wouldn’t be tied to any particular job or study, and young people could use them in combination with student visas to get more years in the UK. GB News was quick to respond, interviewing the Conservative MP Gareth Davies, who said: “We want less migration not more migration and we know that Labour are cosying up to the European Union”. The fact that this is untrue – 72% of Britons support such a scheme – is just detail.In the neutral, pragmatic, sleeves-rolled-up language of a trade organisation, this report delivers an important warning: they arrived at that figure of 44,000 because that’s how many more young people are leaving, for New Zealand, Canada and Australia, than are coming in. You could pinpoint proximal reasons for that – student debt, wage stagnation and the underfunding of services are making it much more attractive to be a doctor in Australia than in the UK, for example. Our political establishment, with its “violent indifference” to young people, has made a forceful case for emigration.Whether that’s because you can’t ignore an entire generation for ever without breaking the bonds of patriotic loyalty, or whether it’s because a bunch of young people could just use a break from the tedium and stasis of their own political culture, has yet to become clear. But it would be foolish not to consider the real danger of the scheme, which is not the arrival of energetic, adventurous, ambitious young Europeans. Rather, it’s that young Britons, their interests disregarded so openly, so shamelessly, will leave and move mountains to not come back.That’s not an argument against the scheme, incidentally. As Sting would tell you, if you love them, set them free.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This isn’t pragmatism – it’s crueltySteve Valdez-Symonds is refugee and migrant rights director at Amnesty UKWed 10 Dec 2025 10.25 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 12.28 ESTShareWhen Keir Starmer and Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, argue that asylum protections must be rewritten for a new “era”, they are not simply adjusting policy. They arereshaping the moral groundour societies stand on.Their message is clear: hardening rules so that fewer people receive protection is the way to restore confidence in their leadership. They present this as measured and responsible, even progressive. But what they propose is not a new centre ground; it is a retreat into a politics that regards some lives as less worthy than others.And there is a dreadful irony in seeing such a message conveyed just as the UK justice secretary, David Lammy, and Richard Hermer, the attorney general,travel to Strasbourgon International Human Rights Day – an occasion createdto commemoratethe Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the recognition, set down by the postwar generation, that dignity must not depend on borders, status or political fashion.Human rights were never designed only for safe, comfortable times. They were written precisely for moments like this: when pressure mounts, when scapegoating becomes tempting, when compassion is portrayed as weakness. These protections exist to prevent us from repeating history’s worst mistakes. The whole point of human rights is that they are neither negotiable nor temporary.Yet according to reports, UK ministers are seeking to reinterpret or restrictprotections enshrinedin the European convention on human rights (ECHR) – including the absolute ban on torture and inhuman or degrading treatment under article 3, and article 8, which protects the right to a private life and a family life. These proposals would strip fundamental protections from people fleeing war, persecution or serious harm. Article 3 contains no exceptions. Once you accept that some suffering is acceptable for some people, the principle collapses for everyone.What is even more concerning is the political calculation behind this shift. There appears to be a belief inside government, shared with its predecessors, that if they only appear tougher, if they tweak legal guidance or pick fights with the ECHR, anger over asylum seekers will subside. Advisers who have spent years managing headlines rather than solving problems now tell leaders: this is how you defuse the issue.We have seen exactly where this approach leads. It is the Brexit playbook: concede the premise of those demanding dismantlement, accept their framing, and hope your softer edge keeps you safe. It did not work then and it will not work now. Because once you agree that rights are the real obstacle, you have already handed victory to those who want rid of them altogether.Starmer says he wants the UK to remain in the convention. Yet by echoing the diagnosis of Nigel Farage and others, that human rights protections prevent governments taking back “control”, he is already on their path. The destination becomes harder to avoid once you have set out in their direction.We are not talking about abstract principles. We are talking about children separated from parents. Trafficking survivors sent back to abusers. Torture survivors returned to torture. Real human beings whose futures depend on whether our leaders uphold protections or erode them.If ministers were genuinely interested in fixing the system, they would stop pretending that cruelty is capability. The UK’s costly asylum backlog is not caused by rights. It is the product of years of deliberate mismanagement: banning people from working, trapping them in limbo and relying on expensive, unsuitable accommodation that helps no one.There are solutions that actually work. The UK could provide safe routes so that fewer people are forced into dangerous journeys. It could restore swifter, fairer asylum decision-making, clearing the backlog and allowing people to rebuild their lives, while ensuring the return of people without good claims is carried out with dignity. It could support communities instead of leaving them under-resourced and resentful. It could work internationally to address the conflicts and instability that drive people from their homes.Starmer and Frederiksen say they want to protect the fabric of our societies. But that fabric is not torn by people seeking sanctuary. It frays when leaders imply that some people’s suffering counts for less. It weakens when governments teach the public that fellow human beings should be treated harshly to make a point.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They do not trust politicians of the day to decide which groups qualify for their rights.Human rights show the floor beneath which we must never sink, the line that should hold firm when pressure builds. Weakening that line, especially today, would not be pragmatism.

But on Tuesday when the RBA monetary policy board announced the cash rates staying at 3.6%, the markets all got a bit spooked.First off, the statement released was a rather big change from the usual. Normally investors, speculators and lowly economists pick through each sentence looking for subtle word changes and trying to work out what the RBA means. For example, last year the December changed the wording of one subheading from“The outlook remains highly uncertain”to“The outlook remains uncertain”.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThis time round, however, there were wholesale changes to the statement. Gone were the subheadings inthe November statementandthe December statementwas around a third shorter.There were still some of the old tea leaves readings though.In November that RBA noted “The Board’s judgment is that some of the increase in underlying inflation in the September quarter was due to temporary factors”.This month’s statement had the same sentence but followed up with a new one stating: “Nevertheless, the data do suggest some signs of a more broadly based pickup in inflation, part of which may be persistent and will bear close monitoring.”There are two big drivers of Australia’s economic growth – but shape matters as much as size | Greg JerichoRead moreThat seemed like the RBA was a bit more worried about inflation and “hawkish” to use the economic jargon.But the real impact on markets came whenBullock gave her press conferencelater in the day and told the reporters: “It does look like additional cuts are not needed.”She followed up even more stridently saying, “I don’t think there are interest rate cuts on the horizon for the foreseeable future. The question is, is it just an extended hold from here or is it the possibility of a rate rise? I couldn’t put a probability on those, but I think they’re the two things that the board will be looking closely at coming into the new year.”Boom.And with that the market started pricing in a rate hike by May.To let you know how madly sentiment has swung, less than two months ago the market was not only predicting that the cash rate would already be at 3.35% but that by May next year a further cut to 3.1% was almost certain.Now the market is betting that by May there will be a rate rise to 3.85% and by the end of next year we’ll be looking at 4.1%:If the graph does not display click hereThis, of course, does not mean the market is more right now than it was in October – just that those whose job it is to make money speculating on what the RBA might do have decided that, when the governor of the RBA tells you there won’t be any more rate cuts, to believe her.It is worth remembering that this time last year the market predicted pretty well all the rate cuts that came in 2025, but it also thought the cuts would continue:If the graph does not display click hereFor the moment I am less ready to follow the market up the interest rate mountain climb.Importantly there’s no sense of wage growth taking off. In fact, it is slowing in the private sector:If the graph does not display click hereThe number of unemployed for each job vacancy remains at historic low levels, but has been rising slowly, yet steadily, for three years now:If the graph does not display click hereBut the worry is that even if unemployment rises and it becomes harder to get work, the RBA will just use that as a reason to keep rates on hold whereas, if inflation rises or stays around where it is now, it will use that as a reason to increase rates.As ever the “dual mandate” on the RBA of stable prices and full employment is more heavily biased to stable prices.The RBA in its statement and in Bullock’s comments seems very excited that the private sector is recovering and is now contributing more to economic growth than the public sector. But, asI noted last week, the big cause of the increase in household spending was on essentials like insurance, healthcare and energy rather than an exuberance for shopping.Similarly, the contribution of private sector investment to economic growth remains pretty mild and driven mostly by an abnormal investment in new datacentres, which is unlikely to produce many jobs:If the graph does not display click hereWe now wait for Thursday’s unemployment figures and the economic data that comes out in January before the RBA gets back from its summer holiday on 3 February.That coincides with the first parliament sitting day of the year.If the RBA does decide to increase rates, it will no doubt colour the rest of the political year and mean those speculating more than one rate rise next year, will probably be right, regardless of whether the economy needs them.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsReserve Bank of AustraliaGrogonomicsInterest ratesAustralian economycommentShareReuse this content"

Brexit, Covid, austerity and the rise in the cost of living haven’t helped.From the students’ perspectives, they’ve gone through a lot to get here too. Not just the usual high-level academic performance and résumé-building either. This is a group who dealt with school closures and lockdowns during impressionable years, many come from crowded schools with little support and coaching, and yet they’ve found a way to persevere.Having spent years teaching in medical schools and talking to students, my main feeling is hope. They’re smart, respectful and polite, with interesting backgrounds and ideas. Rather than being put off by the pandemic, some have been drawn to medicine because of the key role of the NHS during those difficult years, and remember joining the Thursday “clap for carers” and putting rainbow signs in their windows at home. Quite a few are keen to get into public health research and want to combine clinical and academic careers.These are young people who could walk into finance, tech, consulting, influencing … careers where their intelligence and work ethic would be rewarded with salaries unthinkable in medical pay packets. They could choose a different life. But they have chosen medicine.What lies ahead isn’t pretty: night shifts, weekends on-call and a future of working in intense environments. This could be in A&E or surgery, where treatment is literally about life and death. Or working in a GP practice where they’ll meet patient after patient where the suffering isn’t only medical, but also social – financial precarity, loneliness, bad housing – and they’ll be expected to find a solution. As Covid showed us, it could be working through a pandemic and watching your colleagues get sick and die (sometimes because of inappropriate PPE), or burn out and walk away from medicine.And don’t even mention the pay: after all those years of training,pay starts at £18.62/hour in England, although with overtime over nights and weekends this can go up to £20-30/hour. Yes this is a good wage, but is it in line with the qualifications, responsibilities and expertise the job requires? They used to be officially called “junior doctors”, but the newly introduced title “resident doctor” is more appropriate given they’re often the first point of contact for sick patients and have independent clinical responsibilities. The allocation system for resident doctors means that they can’t commit to living in a specific city or location: they can note their preferences but could end up being placed in hospitals hundreds of miles away, depending on the match between request and need.Medicine used to, at least, be a stable profession with a job at the end of the long training road. But what awaits many graduates is uncertainty, whether it’s training bottlenecks, chaotic rotas or even unemployment, given funding cuts. The UK already hasfewer doctors per capitathan many comparable nations and struggles to retain the ones it has, given more attractive careers abroad, for example in Australia or Ireland. As a GP colleague said to me: “When many GP registrars finish their full training, there are no jobs for them, because of the lack of investment in general practice. So, they are forced to locum [ad hoc work] and many are leaving the country.”I have mixed emotions thinking about the past week. Sitting across from these candidates, who are articulate, values-driven and hard-working, I felt enormous hope. They are exactly the sort of people you’d want making decisions in a crisis, breaking difficult news to a family, or calmly helping someone put together a life that has gone physically or emotionally off track.But I also felt sadness, because I know that the system they are stepping into may not treat them with the same care they plan to offer others. We need to ask: if we expect these young doctors to invest their lives into the NHS and the values underpinning publicly provided universal healthcare, shouldn’t we make sure this commitment isn’t betrayed? That at the very least there’s a job at the end of the long road? And that they are not wasted in a system that undervalues their training and increasingly replaces them with less-trained practitioners simply to fill staffing gaps?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then I encountered an AI triagist, a stubborn receptionist and a Kafkaesque vicious circleWed 10 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 12.44 ESTShareAcouple of months ago the health secretary, Wes Streeting, rolled out his latest master plan to save the NHS. From 1 October, it became compulsory for all GP practices in England to offer the online option for patients torequest non-urgent appointmentsor medical advice throughout core working hours (8am to 6.30pm, Monday to Friday).The doctors’ unionmight not have much liked it, but it made sense to regular punters like me. It seemed like a common sense means of avoiding the maddening early morning scramble for the few available appointments, hanging on for an age, only to be told all the slots have gone. Or worse, just have the phone go dead on you.Who wouldn’t prefer filling out a form in relative serenity? And, of course, it was just an option. TheNHSmade it clear that those who struggled with literacy or forms, or didn’t have access to the right technology, could still phone. So it seemed like the best of all worlds.Only Streeting hadn’t bargained for practices misusing the system.A few days ago, I started getting typical winter flu symptoms. I have a history of flu turning into bacterial pneumonia, and on one occasion sepsis. A course of antibiotics tends to knock it on the head early.I dutifully filled in the online form because it has always been a nightmare getting through to the GP. I explained my history – chest, pneumonia, sepsis. At the end, I discovered I had been triaged by AI and it had decidednotto refer me to the GP. I was told that my request for an appointment would be going no further and I had to talk to the GP directly. It explained that the symptoms I described sounded potentially dangerous. “We can’t safely assess your symptoms through this online request. You need to talk to somebody today instead,” the AI triagist replied in the name of my GP practice.It seemed to make sense. After all, the form is primarily for non-urgent cases, and it had decided mine could be serious. But I didn’t realise I was trapped in a catch-22 at that point.I did what I’ve always done before the introduction of the online system. I phoned the practice.Me: “Hi, could I make an appointment with the doctor please? I think I have a chest infection.”Receptionist: “You have to fill in an e-form. We are no longer making appointments by phone.”Even the language was alienating. God knows how I’d cope if I was much older or struggling to make sense of the digital world.“I have filled in the form. It rejected me, and said it wouldn’t pass on my complaint and I had to speak to the practice directly.”“Sorry, you need to fill in the e-form to get an appointment,” she repeated.I explained that meant it was now impossible for me to get an appointment if the online form rejected me as too serious and the practice simply didn’t want to know unless it was via the form. As Kafkaesque vicious circles went, it was up with the best of them. If I’d not felt so bad I might have found it funny. Briefly.But I was one of the fortunate patients – I knew the form was an option, not a replacement, and I was gobby enough to say so. Disturbingly, the practice website said that urgent calls as well as routine calls had to go through the online system. An FAQ document from NHSEnglandstates that the online “consultation tool” was primarily for “non-urgent appointment requests, medication queries and admin requests”.The NHS acknowledges that sometimes, practices might choose to refer urgent cases through the form, “but patients with urgent needsshould still call their GP practice or attend in person”. Dr Amanda Doyle, the national director for primary care and community services at NHS England, said: “This is unacceptable – GP practices must keep their premises, telephone lines and online consultation tools open from 8am until 6.30pm, as part of their contractual requirements.”I’m sure most GP practices will abide by the founding principle of the online form being a) an option and b) mainly for non-urgent appointments. But for those that don’t, the impact will be deadly. The NHS must clarify its position that the online booking system is an option, an extra choice, and that it is meant for non-urgent appointments. Practices that tell patients it is a replacement system must be penalised.Share your experienceHave you had a similar experience?

The receptionist said she would make an exception for me. Which made me more furious than if they’d simply turned me away. After all, doctors are now contractually obliged now to provide patients with access through three routes – online, via phone and in person.The doctor looked delighted when I told her that the new system was disastrous. She couldn’t agree more, she said. I told her why it didn’t work for me and how the practice was misusing the system, but before I finished she appeared to have lost interest and was gesturing me to the door. I asked her why she thought it was disastrous. “We’re getting too many referrals,” she said.Just before this article was published, the surgery got in touch to tell me that it was amending its website to make clear that patients can still make appointments by phone or in person.Simon Hattenstone is a features writer for the GuardianExplore more on these topicsNHSOpinionDoctorsHealthWes StreetingEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

In his remarks, Modi referred to Putin as “my friend” and the India-Russia relationship as a “guiding star”, built on “mutual respect and deep trust” that had “stood the test of time”. This was Putin’s 10th visit to India since he assumed power 25 years ago, and his 20th meeting with Modi since the latter became prime minister in 2014.However, there is a gap between the symbolism and the substance of this relationship. While Putin pledged “uninterrupted fuel supplies” to India, the country’a companies are buying less Russian oil in the face of US tariffs and sanctions. Russia and India concluded a string ofmemorandums of understandingin areas from migration and mobility to health and food security, maritime cooperation, fertilisers, customs, and academic and media collaboration. But the anticipated announcements on major defence deals did not happen. India has not concluded any major defence deals with Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. This has been fuelled by delays in the delivery of several platforms and spare parts as Moscow has prioritised its own defence needs. This is a trend that predates the war in Ukraine as New Delhi has sought to diversify its defence imports and strengthen its domestic production.This all suggests that the India-Russia relationship does not hold the same geopolitical heft it once did. During the cold war, India maintained preferential barter arrangements and market access to the Soviet Union and its satellite states. This privileged relationship reached its pinnacle in 1971, when New Delhi and Moscow concluded a Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation ahead of a war that India fought with Pakistan, during which Islamabad was backed by the US and China. While both countries have sought to maintain a semblance of this relationship through their “special and privileged strategic partnership”, announced in 2010, the reality is that their engagement does not hold the same significance as New Delhi has deepened relations with the west.New Delhi will not sever its importantrelationship with Moscow. But as the west appliespressure on Indiato reduce its Russian oil imports, both countries are seeking to diversify the relationship into other areas. During Putin’s visit, India and Russia announced aneconomic cooperation programmelasting until 2030 that aims to make their relationship “more diversified, balanced and sustainable”. This includes improving market access for Indian products to address a trade imbalance that is heavily skewed in Russia’s favour, amid a sharp increase in India’s buying of Russian oil(up from less than 1% before the war in Ukraine to35%– though many Indian refinerspaused buying Russian oilin October). Cooperation between the two countries spans several strategically important sectors – from space and nuclear to defence and food security.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This has translated into a degree of sympathy for the Russian narrative of the war in Ukraine – that it was triggered by Nato expansion into Russia’s self-perceived sphere of influence. Amid the recent war of words between India and the US, with Trump and his officials referring to India as a“dead” economyand a “laundromat for the Kremlin”, many in India see Russia as a more reliable partner.And yet it is also important to recognise what hasn’t happened. During Modi’s visit to China in August, much was made of the photos showingModi, Putin and the Chinese president, Xi Jinpingwith each other. While this prompted speculation about an emerging triple entente, it did not translate into a formal revival of the Russia-India-China trilateral relationship that Moscow spearheaded in the 1990s, but which has lost momentum in recent years. Modi did not attend a military parade in Beijing where several world leaders, including Putin and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, were present. This reflects New Delhi’s desire to project a worldview that is non-western but not explicitly anti-western.This does not belie the fact that there are inherent contradictions in India’s foreign policy. It is set to conclude a free trade agreementwith the EU, following atrade deal with the UKearlier this year. On the sidelines of the G20 summit in South Africa in November, Australia, Canada and India also announced a trilateral technology and innovationpartnership. There are 10 times as many Indian students studying in the US than there are in Russia, although efforts are being made to strengthen people-to-people contacts between India and Russia with the opening of two new Indian consulates there, a simplification of visa regimes and a labour mobility agreement.Putin should have accepted Trump’s deal. Now Russia’s collapsing economy could lead to his downfall | Simon TisdallRead moreThe challenge, of course, is the ongoing war in Ukraine. The 70-pointjoint statementconcluded during Putin’s India visit made no reference to Ukraine, although it ironically makes reference to the India-Russia relationship as an “anchor of global peace and stability”. Despite Modi’s much-touted statements that “now is not the era of war”, New Delhi’s actions regarding the conflict in Ukraine have been limited (at least publicly).How willIndiasquare this circle? New Delhi will be hoping that the ongoing peace negotiations will bear fruit, leading to a cessation of hostilities and a removal of a key thorn in India’s relations with the west. However, even when a peace deal is reached, if this remains short of a “just peace” that upholds Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, scrutiny of the India-Russia relationship will continue in western capitals.Dr Chietigj Bajpaee is senior fellow for south Asia at the thinktank Chatham HouseExplore more on these topicsIndiaOpinionNarendra ModiVladimir PutinRussiaOilcommentShareReuse this content"

None that I can seeRavi HolyThe extremist, who is said to have converted in prison, is now planning a mass carol service. But look at his words and deeds: hardly Saint Tommy, is it?Wed 10 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 06.04 ESTShareHere’s a thought for the day: what kind of Christian am I, andwhat kind of Christianis Tommy Robinson? It needs addressing, and so it’s good, given the far-righter’s recent religiously contentious pronouncements – and ahead of his planned carol service this weekend – that my church is addressing it. That’s not to say the matter is simple.Scroll back. When I told someone from the Pentecostal church, which I had attended in my 20s, that I was going to be ordained in the Church of England, she very graciously conceded that while, on the whole, it was a “dead church”, there might be one or two “real Christians” within it. More disturbingly, a senior Anglican cleric of the evangelical persuasion recently said something similar to me – and I was unclear whether he regardedmeas being one of the chosen few.But as a theological liberal, I’m always uncomfortable with the notion that any human being can decide who’s in and who’s out. Jesus was very clear that none of us is in a position to judge each other, so I’m generally loth to pronounce anyone “not a real Christian”. And then along comes Robinson …I’d been aware of Robinson’s existence for several years. As someone who suffered at the hands – and the boots – of far-right thugs in the 80s, for the crime of being brown-skinned, I found it laughable when he first startedclaiming to bea Christian. Clearly, he could no more name his favourite Bible verse than could President Donald Trump – who, famously, attempted to wriggle out of answering that question by saying that he didn’t want to “get into specifics”. And it seemed obvious that all Robinson’s rhetoric about this being a Christian country was simply code for “white” and specifically “not Muslim”.However, more recently, he is said to have had a conversion experiencewhile in prisonand has started to associate with people whom I would genuinely consider to be fellow Christians. That makes it somewhat harder for me to simply anathematise him. I felt a bit the same when Russell Brand was verypublicly baptised by Bear Gryllsshortly after being accused of some horrible crimes.It is, of course, a key tenet of the Christian faith that no one is beyond redemption and, in Luke’s gospel,Jesus said: “There will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over 99 righteous people who don’t need to repent.” On that basis, I don’t want to castanyoneinto outer darkness, especially as a reformed prodigal myself. But – and it’s a big but, as it were – Jesus also said that true repentance should bear fruit (“by their fruits you shall know them”) and, to me, the new Tommy doesn’t seem radically different from the old one.My colleague (and Facebook friend), the right reverendArun Arorawas – as one might expect from a bishop – more gracious recently when explainingthe church’s decision to challenge Robinsonand his “put the Christ back in Christmas” carol service. He said that Robinson’s conversion (the veracity of which he did not dispute) was “welcome”, but it did not give him “the right to subvert the faith so that it serves his purposes rather than the other way round”.He went on to stress that care for the most vulnerable in society has always been a core Judeo-Christian value, expressed by all the Hebrew prophets, including Jesus himself.I would certainly be interested to hear how Robinson and his newfound mentors such asPastor Rikki DoolanorBishop Ceirion Dewarwould interpret eitherExodus 23:9(“Do not oppress a foreigner; you yourselves know how it feels to be foreigners, because you were foreigners in Egypt”), orMatthew 25, in which Jesus suggests that the basis on which people will be separated into sheep and goats at the last judgment will be whether or not they visited the sick, fed the hungry or – most significantly in this context – were hospitable to strangers.Of course, they probably don’t care that they are flying in the face of the opinions of most Christians, whom they regard as weak and ineffectual. On the day that Dame Sarah Mullally wasnamed as the next archbishop of Canterbury, Robinson retweeted a statement that she’d made in support of Black Lives Matter a few years previously with the gloss “Their churches will stay empty, a Christian revival will grow on the streets. Masculine christiany [sic] is coming not this weak drivel”.Well, I’m a big fan of the bishop. I support the women’s ministry in general as well as other liberal causes such as equal marriage. So Saint Tommy would, no doubt, see me as a purveyor of “feminine Christianity” – which I would take as a badge of honour. The sermon on the mount declared themeekto be blessed, not the strong. Newsflash: Jesus died on a Roman cross. Hence, Saint Paul’s statement that God’s power is made perfect “in weakness”. So, for me, as for many in the church, Robinson’s “masculine” Christianity is pretty much the antithesis of everything Jesus stood for.So does that mean that he’s not a real Christian? Well, I have no window into his soul. And I already share a national church with people who disagree with me strongly on all sorts of issues: that’s what happens in a family.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In dictatorships, or under military occupation, you join the resistance. The distinction isn’t precise but it matters.All European democracies have radical anti-immigration parties, some on the fringes of opposition, some that have crossed into the mainstream. None qualify as heroic resistance movements, except in the minds of white supremacists who see liberal institutions as part of aconspiracy to ruin Europeby filling it with foreigners. That is also the view taken in the new White House national security strategy,published last week.The authors identify “civilisational erasure” by mass migration as a threat to American interests. To counter it, they propose “cultivating resistance … within European nations”. That means meddling in other countries’ domestic politics to boost those extreme nationalists – paranoiacs posing as patriots – who want to sabotage continental cooperation.The EU is the main target of that agenda, because the combined power of European nations as a single bloc is a nuisance to Donald Trump in trade policy. He wants many small European clients, not one big economic competitor. Promoting far-right parties that will send nationalist wreckers to Brussels advances that goal.So doestacit encouragementof Russian interests in Ukraine. Washington is impatient to get a lopsided peace deal over the line, and to normalise commercial relations with a Kremlin regime that machinates ceaselessly to undermine stability and solidarity among European democracies.This all means there is a vacancy for a Maga stooge in Britain. Donald Trump can do some business with Keir Starmer, but there is no affinity of belief or shared cupidity with a Labour prime minister. The obvious partner would be Nigel Farage. The Reform UK leader oversells his intimacy with the US president’s entourage, but he is a stronger candidate for patronage thanKemi Badenoch, and not just because he is a white man.TheConservativesare the official opposition. The Reform leader styles himself as a figurehead for resistance. The difference is more significant than it appears when the two parties stand on overlapping platforms. The Tories crave restoration to what they see as their rightful position at the apex of the established political hierarchy. Farage depends for his support on people who see that hierarchy as the problem. Badenoch wants to reclaim the house from Labour squatters. Reform wants to burn the house down.That doesn’t necessarily make the Conservatives more moderate than Reform. To prove how tough they can be on immigration, the Toriespublished a draft billearlier this year that overshot even Farage’s anti-foreigner zeal in its intent to expel thousands of legally settled people from Britain. Itdidn’t improveBadenoch’s ratings. She can’t outbid Farage for the trust of voters who care most about demographic dilution. Her party has a legacy of border management for him to attack; he has no governing record to defend.Badenoch has now understood, with help from party grandees who privately urged a different approach, that she is better off changing the subject. The preferred topic is now the economy, where some recent polls show Conservatives are trusted more than Labour or Reform. That advantage may seem unearned, given the legacy of Brexit and Liz Truss. But the image of the Tories as the team you don’t have to like but can trust with money runs deep in the political culture. So does its counterpart cliche – that Labour always raises taxes and spends the proceeds on benefits.Since Rachel Reeves’s recent budget did so much to reinforce that caricature, Conservatives are starting to feel more bullish about their prospects. Optimism would be too strong a word, but MPs think they can discern a vacancy opening up for a party that promises low taxes, spending restraint and more professional economic management than anyone expects from Farage and whichever spivvy grifter he may choose as his chancellor.The Tories expect doubts about Reform’s competence and the shallowness of its talent pool to grow, as inexperienced councillors and mayors struggle to run the offices they have captured in local elections. Mindful of that vulnerability, Farage will want to recruit heavy-hitting Conservative defectors – former ministers, not just bloviating backbenchers – as a general election draws nearer.But Reform has to be careful not to contaminate its maverick brand by looking like an agent of Conservative continuity. Farage’s base is stacked with former Tory voters, but that doesn’t make them amenable to switching back. No one joins the resistance to help elect has-beens from the regime they thought they were resisting.Rotten government and stale opposition constitute one “uniparty” in Farage’s telling. That is why he has to insist in public that he isn’t interested in pacts with the Tories, although ithas been reported that, in private audience with donors, he accepts the likely need for such an arrangement.The electoral logic is irrefutable, but hard to translate into an operational joint venture. There are heaps of seats that incumbent Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs will hold if the local rightwing vote splits between Reform and Tories. There are fewer where it is obvious which challenging party should stand down in deference to the other. There are no reserves of trust at local or leadership level to support a trade in political favours where the currency is bruised egos and thwarted ambition.For now, it is a waiting game. Farage hopes the Tories mayyet collapseand send him scores of sitting MPs looking for safe seats as Reform candidates. The Conservatives hope Reform has peaked; that normal political gravity will weigh on Farage as his suitability to be prime minister comes under scrutiny.That would happen sooner if Badenoch opposed Reform with anything like the ferocity she brings to attacks on the government. But she doesn’t see that as her job.Most frontbench Conservatives won’t go on the record saying Farage is unfit to lead the country, even if they suspect it to be true, because they also suspect they may be propping up his government, or pleading for jobs in it, by the end of the decade.The dwindled pack of genuine Tory moderates, viscerally appalled by Reform rhetoric, view this whole process “from under the duvet”, as one MP puts it. They are waiting for the nightmare to end, despairing that they don’t have the numbers or the leadership to end it.There is no encouragement in the experience of other western democracies where established centre-right parties have been eclipsed by radical challengers. The trend is for the old guard to switch from denial of the threat, via defeat, to craven collaboration, usually rationalised with the delusion that a restraining influence can be exerted from the inside.Badenoch’s Conservatives have so far shown no more courage in fighting firebrand nationalism than those traditional Republicans who let themselves beconsumed in the Maga inferno. One important difference is that British voters see what is happening in the US and most don’t like it.The offer contained in Trump’s national security doctrine – to turn Britain into one of Washington’s satellite states in a Europe partitioned between Russian and American spheres of influence – is not one that any truly patriotic politician should accept. It is easy to see the appeal for Farage, as a fellow traveller of the Maga project. For Badenoch it presents an important dividing line, albeit one that Conservatives cannot see or dare not name. It is the difference between an opposition party that is loyal to British democracy, and one that would serve a foreign despot and call it resistance.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsConservativesOpinionReform UKKemi BadenochNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

Her facilitator reveals why her victory is so seismic – and the secrets of her party playlistWed 10 Dec 2025 12.22 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 13.04 ESTShareThe morning after theTurner prizeceremony, the winner of the UK’s most prestigious art award, Nnena Kalu, is eating toast and drinking a strong cup of tea. Everyone around her is beaming – only a little the worse for wear after dancing their feet off at the previous night’s party in Bradford, and sinking “a couple of brandies” back at the hotel bar. I say hello to Kalu, offer my congratulations, and admire the 59-year-old’s beautifully manicured creamy pink nails. But the interview is with her facilitator, Charlotte Hollinshead, who has worked with the artist since 1999. Kalu has limited verbal communication skills; she has learning disabilities and is autistic.As for Hollinshead, she is struggling to encapsulate the enormity of the win: for Kalu herself; forActionSpace, the organisation that has supported her for 25 years; and for the visibility and acceptance of artists with learning disabilities within the wider art world. “It’s unbelievably huge,” she says. “I have to think back to where we started, when there was absolutely no interest whatsoever. I’d sit at dinner parties with friends in the art world. Nobody was interested in what I did, or who we worked with. We couldn’t get any exhibitions anywhere. No galleries were interested. Other artists weren’t interested. Art students weren’t interested. We have had to claw our way up from the very depths of the bottom.”View image in fullscreenShimmering forms … a videotape piece in the Turner prize show.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe previous night, in her speech on behalf of Kalu, she described the win as “seismic”. Kalu’s exhibition – which wastippedto win by Guardian art critic Adrian Searle – leaps out joyously at the Turner prize show at Bradford’sCartwright Hall Art Gallery. First the sculptures hit the eye – bulbous, bulging, shimmering multicoloured forms that snake and pretzel into themselves. They are built in layers of materials, wrapped and bound, bundled and draped in tape, ribbon, mesh, plastic. Videotape, one of Kalu’s favoured materials, dances and shimmers in a draught too faint to feel against your skin. Second, you are pulled into the drawings, which are all diptychs and triptychs, the pairs and trios near-echoes of each other. Whorls and spirals express the artist’s precise bodily range, the reach of her arm: you can feel how human they are. I’ve seen a film of her working and the regular sweep-swoosh of the crayon or pencil on paper in its rhythmic flow is something beautiful to hear. The spiral shapes she often creates are like cochleas or the deep interiors of shells, receding into a darkened blue-black vortex at the centre.I’m curious to know how Hollinshead works with Kalu in thestudio. She puts to rest one misconception: Kalu is not non-verbal. She tends not to speak in a large group, says Hollinshead. But one-on-one, absolutely she does. Hollinshead tells me that earlier, in the lift down to their hotel breakfast, they’d been discussing the playlist for a celebration that’s being planned in London to mark the win. Kalu listed off, Hollinshead tells me: “The Bee Gees, Donna Summer, Stevie Wonder, Abba, Hot Chocolate.”Kalu works between two and four days a week in the studio. “She’ll tell me what colours she wants, what materials she wants,” says Hollinshead. “It’s my job to get all that ready for her and lay them out. We always call it her ‘buffet’. She dips in and out with whatever she wants to work with.” Kalu has echolalia – she often repeats what is said to her – “but you give her space, you give her time, and then she says what’s on her mind,” says Hollinshead.Kalu is very clear about when her works on paper are finished (many artists would give a lot for that particular sense of clarity). “The biggest part of my job,” says Hollinshead, “is watching her as well as listening and making sure that we’re always responding to her needs, that we’re not manoeuvring her and that we’re not pushing her in a direction, but we’re just sensitively ensuring that she’s got everything she needs to do what she wants to do.”The big sculptures are a slightly different thing: “She has reworked loads and loads of pieces, building them up to the point now where they become completely gargantuan, unruly pieces of art.” Usually, for a show, she’ll finish them in the exhibition space, which she did in Bradford, sometimes upending what curators had expected. But, as Hollinshead points out, that’s pretty normal for any artist working on a show.Hollinshead is clear about the long-term purpose she has had through the 30 years she has worked withActionSpace, which, aside from Kalu, supports dozens of other artists with learning disabilities. She wants the artists to be seen maturely as part of the contemporary art world, in the mainstream of its institutions. For her, it has been a case of the art world catching up with Kalu’s capabilities, not the other way around.View image in fullscreen‘A life commitment to the work’ … Kalu adding the finishing touches to a sculpture.Photograph: Jules Lister/Courtesy of Humber Street Gallery and the artist“Nnena was ready for this quite a few years ago, but everybody else wasn’t,” she says. And if Kalu has finally breached what Hollinshead called, in her acceptance speech, “a very stubborn glass ceiling”, there are many who have been totally overlooked.“We’ve got a whole storage unit filled with two decades of amazing art waiting for a massive ActionSpace retrospective. It breaks my heart that so many of those people didn’t have their moment in the limelight,” she says. “I’m so happy that this has happened while Nnena is all guns blazing, while she can really enjoy it. She does understand what’s happening. She really does – and it’s utterly, properly joyous.”I’m intrigued by Hollinshead’s determination to break down the barriers to the art world, perhaps because Kalu’s work, her very way of being, poses a challenge to so much of what is considered important in that world. The art world is, paradoxically for a visual art form, very concerned with the verbal: with artists talking about their work, explaining it, despite the fact that doing so is often a struggle for the artists themselves and not especially illuminating for audiences.“I have been told explicitly that Nnena wouldn’t be able to have an art career because she couldn’t conceptualise her practice and share it,” says Hollinshead.She couldn’t give a toss about the art world, but she does care about exhibitionsThe art world is also structured around questions of value and the market that seem not to impinge much on Kalu – she is obviously deeply invested in making her work, but it doesn’t seem as if she cares much about the outer trappings.“She couldn’t give a toss about the art world,” agrees Hollinshead, “but what she does care about is putting exhibitions together. If we want to do more exhibitions, and for them to be really big and juicy and have a budget so she can let rip and do her thing, we need to play the game a bit. And I think last night we did turn the art world upside down a little.”It has been a slow, incremental road to mainstream acceptance for Kalu. Hollinshead talks of the early years, when the only exhibitions available for her and other artists with learning disabilities were in the town hall and libraries in the London borough of Wandsworth, where their work together began. A turning point for Kalu was being invited to make a solo show as part ofGlasgow Internationalin 2018 (the city where she was born, of Nigerian parents, in 1966). “It was the first time curators and gallery directors and other artists came and saw the work,” says Hollinshead.An exhibition in Hull followed – a solo show atHumber Street Gallery. Hollinshead laughs as she tells me about observing a man watching Kalu at work and then returning with his son, a student at Glasgow School of Art. “The man told his son: ‘Look:thatis an artist.Thatis a life commitment to the work.’”View image in fullscreen‘Unruly pieces’ … part of an exhibition in Barcelona in 2024.Photograph: Ivan Erofeev/Courtesy of Manifesta 15 Barcelona MetropolitanaThis year Kalu had herfirst solo exhibition overseas, at Kunsthall Stavanger. Hollinshead is still pinching herself. “We took a woman with really complex learning disabilities to Norway to install her solo show. I mean, that’s unheard of, for a UK artist. It really is groundbreaking stuff.”Hollinshead is still wearing a rosette on her jumper that all team Kalu were sporting the previous evening – in its centre a cheery photo of the artist and the words, “Idol, legend, winner, whatever”. They are a quotation from one of the participants in a workshop that Kalu led recently. Hollinshead tells me her ActionSpace colleagues have been flooded today with messages from day centres and special educational needs schools. “I think the ripple effects of this are going to be massive,” she says. “Schools are doing art projects based on Nnena. All these students are wrapping and drawing; we’re being sent pictures by teachers.”She tells me about a visit they made this week to a special educational needs unit at a mainstream school in Bradford. Kalu got stuck in with the kids who were making wrapped sculptures. Hollinshead pulls out a picture: it shows a little girl, with Down’s syndrome, embracing Kalu’s leg. Apparently she stayed there for the duration of the session. This week’s win for Kalu may be a watershed moment for the art world, a redefinition of what is regarded as valuable and worthy of its highest accolades. But maybe the real significance of it lies in what it might one day mean for little girls like this.The Turner prize is atCartwright Hall Art Gallery, Bradford, until 22 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTurner prizeArtAwards and prizesinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Losing one half of the show’s central duo was no easy thing to move past, but The Last of Us morphed into a touching meditation on grief, loss and the pain of love left unspoken – with added mushroom monsters.What we said:“A gutsy and thoughtful rendering of humans on the edge.”Read more49All Her FaultView image in fullscreenNo one is more watchable … Sarah Snook and Dakota Fanning in All Her Fault.Photograph: Peacock/AP(Sky Atlantic/Now) Is anyone as watchable as Sarah Snook? Her performance as Marissa, whose son Milo was kidnapped when she thought he was on a play date, was an absolute powerhouse as we’ve come to expect from the Succession star. It started with the most profound fear a parent can face, before it turned out to be even worse: orchestrated from within her own inner circle. But the plight of Dakota Fanning as her friend Jenny, trying to navigate the incessant hell and guilt of being a working mother, was relatable and affecting too. Together, they deepened this thriller into something far more intriguing.What we said:“All Her Fault is fantastically well done. All the carefully planted seeds come to fruition. All the narrative cogs turn and interlock fast and seamlessly. You come for the terrifying premise and stay for the absolute pleasure.”Read more48The Last Musician of Auschwitz(BBC Two/iPlayer) This exceptional film told the extraordinary story of the now 100-year-old cellist Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, the only surviving member of the women’s orchestra at Auschwitz. First-hand testimonies – including from the stoic, straight-talking subject herself – plus archive footage and musical performances merged to show the emotional turmoil of prisoners playing beautiful music in a hellscape, as well as tiny glimmers of resistance.What we said:“This incredibly impressive programme does not let us forget about Auschwitz’s corpse mountains or stench of burning bodies for a second, all the while posing questions about art and humanity that should ring in your ears for years to come.”Read more47Apple Cider VinegarView image in fullscreenA tissue of lies … Kaitlyn Dever as Belle Gibson in Apple Cider Vinegar.Photograph: Ben King/AP(Netflix) A remarkable true story, superbly told; this series dramatised the rise and fall of Belle Gibson, an Australian woman who established herself as a “wellness guru” by falsely claiming to have mitigated cancer via dietary tricks and alternative medicine. The truth was simpler: Gibson didn’t have cancer and her career and persona was a tissue of lies. Kaitlyn Dever’s portrayal of Gibson was admirably nuanced; she’s deeply dishonest but also desperately needy and in denial about the consequences of her actions, not least for her followers, some of whom relied upon her hokum to combat life-threatening conditions.What we said:“A fast, drily witty, acutely intelligent, compassionate and furious commentary on greed, need, mass delusion, self-deception, the exploitation of the credulous and the enabling of insidious new forms of all of these by technology.”Read more46The ResidenceView image in fullscreenCharmingly good fun … The Residence.Photograph: Erin Simkin/Netflix(Netflix) Something terrible has happened at the White House! No, not Donald Trump’s new ballroom extension but a fictional murder at the heart of American power. This funny, quirky whodunnit starred Uzo Aduba as Cordelia Cupp, an eccentric detective (she’s a keen birder, dresses entirely in brown tweed and frequently utilises her binoculars for work purposes) sent to solve the case. It’s charmingly good fun – essentially a country house murder mystery with added snark and West Wing trappings.What we said: “A gorgeous, gleeful romp.”Read more45Common Side EffectsView image in fullscreenAn absolute triumph … Common Side Effects.Illustration: Adult Swim(Adult Swim/Channel 4) Has Mike Judge ever made a bad show? This is the question it was hard not to ponder while watching this impeccable animated thriller-comedy. The plot? A fungi expert discovers a mysterious mushroom that seems to cure all illness, and ill-advisedly tells his childhood crush Frances – who now works for big pharma. The resulting high-octane deep-state drama was a blackly humorous adventure with real heart that satirised the state of healthcare in a capitalist society. An absolute triumph of TV-making.What we said:“Not merely the best thing I’ve seen on TV this year but one of the best shows I’ve seen in my life.”Read more44Gaza: Doctors Under Attack(Channel 4) The film the BBC couldn’t broadcast. Thanks be, then, to Channel 4 for stepping into the breach and airing it – for this was an essential document of our times. Its unsparing look at the targeting of Palestinian medics showed a pattern that has emerged over the past two years at hospitals across Gaza. First, they are bombed. Then, they are raided and doctors detained and tortured. Then, when their workplaces are reduced to rubble, the cycle starts on the next hospital. The testimony by Dr Khaled Hamouda, whose home was bombed, killing most of his family … before a drone strike mere moments later hit the supposed safe house his remaining children had escaped to, was an unforgettable piece of television that really needed to be aired.What we said:“In an open letter before its broadcast, Channel 4’s Louisa Compton warned that Doctors Under Attack would ‘make people angry, whichever side they take’. She is right. This is the sort of television that will never leave you.”Read more43Am I Being Unreasonable?View image in fullscreenDangerously addictive … Daisy May Cooper as Nic in Am I Being Unreasonable?Photograph: Simon Ridgway/BBC/Boffola Pictures(BBC One/iPlayer) This riot of marital, sexual and social awkwardness (with a side order of murder and betrayal) came courtesy of Daisy May Cooper and Selin Hizli, who have created a worthy successor to Julia Davis’s scabrous 2004 sitcom Nighty Night. Cooper stars as Nic, a woman juggling guilt, trauma and parenting catastrophe, still finding time for extramarital hi-jinks and yetsomehowremaining deserving of sympathy, mainly because of the cavalcade of monsters around her. A dangerously addictive chamber of horrors.What we said:“Howlingly funny.”Read more42Task(Sky Atlantic/Now) This crime drama starring Mark Ruffalo as gone-to-seed cop Tom Brandis allocated a dangerous new assignment in Philadelphia certainly wasn’t for the faint-hearted. But if you could handle the all-pervasive air of impending catastrophe, it was a fine, gritty, twisty procedural centred on stick-up merchants, biker gangs and the grim ramifications of the fentanyl trade. An intense downer, in the best possible way.What we said:“A meditation on guilt, sin and the possibility of redemption.”Read more41The TraitorsView image in fullscreenThe worst traitor ever to roam the castle … Linda, with fellow traitor Minah and faithful Fozia.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio Lambert(BBC One/iPlayer) Before the celebrity version gave us Alan Carr, the third series of normies Traitors delivered Linda, AKA the worst/best traitor to ever roam the castle. Her head-turn when Claudia Winkleman said “traitors” wasn’t the only golden moment. Charlotte’s fake Welsh accent! Lisa the vicar’s bare-faced lie about her job! The shock return of Alexander! Rare is the show that makes appointment TV and creates national watercooler chat in 2025. But beyond all that – Claudia’s gothic outfits alone were worth tuning in for.What we said:“As a study of human behaviour – of deception, manipulation, self-preservation – it remains captivating. As perhaps the best example of social experiment-style reality TV, it has cemented its place in the cultural firmament.”Read more40-31 coming soonStay tuned for the next episode"

A boy with a serpent in the Appalachians: Hannah Modigh’s best photograph‘I was told not to go to St Charles as it was too dangerous. I went and was struck by how free the kids are. They’re not afraid of the region’s rattlesnakes’Interview byChris BroughtonWed 10 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 13.05 ESTShareIvisited the Appalachian mountains for the first time in my mid-20s, after deciding I needed to get away from my inner circle in Sweden to find my way into photography. I felt I had to be by myself, just responding to things happening around me and not thinking about my daily life.America played a big part in my family history, and the Appalachians called to me in particular because at that time, around 2006, I’d been listening to a lot ofbluegrass music. I wanted to get closer to people who lived in the place where it originated – music has always been a big inspiration for me. While driving in the mountains with no particular destination in mind, I met a social worker who told me: “Whatever you do, don’t go to St Charles.” She said something about it being too dangerous, which made me curious.A social worker told me, ‘Whatever you do, don’t go to St Charles.’ That made me curiousAt one time, St Charles in Virginia, was a booming town serving 10 coal mines. Now, all but one of the mines, Bonny Blue, has shut down, along with all the stores and bars. I stayed in a small motel and photographed everyone I encountered with my medium-format analogue camera, or knocked on people’s doors asking if I could photograph them. One family I got to know well were the Taylors, particularly the three siblings Laken, Josh and Derrick, who at the time were something like 14, 15 and 16. I felt really comfortable around those kids and their parents. I spent Thanksgiving at their place, and Laken and I have stayed in contact ever since.Intimacy is important when I photograph people – I need that feeling of connection, and I try to be open and vulnerable. That means the people I photograph stay with me, and for 20 years the people of St Charles have been deeply rooted in my consciousness.I always imagined I’d return sooner than I did, but stuff happened. I had children of my own and got caught up in other photo projects. But during the past three years, I’ve visited St Charles several times, and this photograph was taken on one of those trips. The boy’s name is Carter – he’s Derrick’s son, and I’ve also got to know his mother, Makayla.A group of us would go walking up in the mountains looking for ginseng. I was very struck and inspired by how free the Taylor family’s kids are. They would run around and look for snakes underneath stones. They’re not afraid of them, even though rattlesnakes and copperheads live in that region. I don’t think Carter’s snake was a poisonous one – he just picked it up and carried it around. Derrick had taught him how to do that, although Carter was sad when he wasn’t allowed to bring it home.One thing I see when I photograph in St Charles is people’s love for the mountains, which are like their backbone. They’re really bound to nature. I try to capture that, and to reveal the inner selves of people through finely tuned details. I think I also mirror myself when I photograph – by describing the lives of others, I tell something about my own life and longings.I’ve realised a lot of my projects circle around themes of social structures, time and memory. When I look at this picture of Carter, there is a sense of heritage because I can see his parents in him, and of course my first book includes photographs of his father when he was young. The picture is from a new series I’m making, The Wild Horses at Bonny Blue. Last year, while staying with the Taylors, I went running and encountered a group of horses protected by a white stallion. When I tried to approach them, they ran away. Laken explained that someone in the town once released some horses that have multiplied and become a mountain herd, which come down when they need more food. With their strong bonds, those horses reminded me of the Taylor family – living wildly and simply, close to nature.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: © Henrik NielsenHannah Modigh’s CVBornStockholm, 1980High point: “Hillbilly Heroin, Honey won the Swedish photo book of the year prize in 2010, which gave me validation to continue.

The director describes capturing their boats getting rammed by the Chinese coast guardWed 10 Dec 2025 09.47 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 11.41 ESTShareDuring a televised debate in 2016, populist presidential candidate Rodrigo Duterte made a typically belligerent statement that he himself would jetski to Scarborough Shoal in the SouthChinaSea and plant a Philippine flag there. Duterte claimed that he was ready to die a hero to keep the Chinese out of the bitterly contested maritime territory.“That made millions of Filipino workers and fishers vote for him because of that one promise,” says film-maker Baby Ruth Villarama. As her new Oscar and Bafta-contending documentaryFood Delivery: Fresh from the West Philippine Seareveals, it wasn’t a promise Duterte kept. “He would make excuses that the jetski has broken down. Eventually there was an official pronouncement that it had just been a campaign joke. From then on, the fisherfolk were really enraged.”In her film, Villarama follows the fishers as they traverse what they call the West Philippine Sea, which thePhilippinesregards as part of its exclusive economic zone. She spent 60 days filming them, as well as recording the work of the soldiers who supply local islands with food. It’s a tough and dangerous existence that has been made even more difficult by continuous harassment from the Chinese coast guard.Food Delivery has beautiful underwater photography and footage of bird colonies as Villarama patiently chronicles the everyday problems faced by the fishers and soldiers. They’re away from their families for long stretches; they have bills to pay; and when he is back on shore one of the main protagonists is shown undergoing tests for prostate cancer. It is in many ways an observational, human interest documentary about life at sea. Nonetheless, since completing the project in March, Villarama has found herself caught in the crosshairs of the Chinese government.View image in fullscreen‘Working in quiet dignity’ … Food Delivery: Fresh from the West Philippine Sea.Photograph: Voyage StudiosFood Delivery was suddenly pulled from the programme of the Philippines’ CinePanalo film festival two days before its world premiere. The reason became apparent when it was subsequently selected for the Doc Edge festival in New Zealand, whose organisers received a formal request from the Chinese Consulate-General in Auckland not to screen the movie. The Consulate-General’s letter,published by the festival,saidthe film was “rife with disinformation and false propaganda, serving as a political tool for the Philippines to pursue illegitimate claims in the South China Sea.”Villarama says the harassment of the fishers “cannot go on”. “The bullying, and boats being chased every week. If we are to live in a stable society, we have to respect certain boundaries. This 200-mile exclusive economic zone is a gift to every country. The UK has it, the US has it, the Philippines has it.”Food Delivery: Fresh from the West Philippine Sea review – gripping trip along supply lines in China standoffRead moreA certain strained civility still exists between the Chinese and the Philippines coast guards. This is a campaign of harassment that can include ramming and the cutting of ropes but both sides try to steer clear of outright physical violence. Villarama and her camera crew were themselves on board a ship that got rammed by the Chinese coast guard. She expresses her relief that the ship didn’t sink: “I am not a good swimmer. I can float – but I am not a good swimmer.”Villarama previously worked as a stringer for Reuters and as a TV journalist and her 2016 documentary Sunday Beauty Queen explored the plight of Philippine foreign workers looking for escape from their lives of underpaid drudgery by taking part in beauty pageants.Now, though, the stakes are high. It’s not just about the livelihoods of those working in the fishing industry – national food security is at risk. “I did not ask for this personally. Who would want to make a film that would go against a superpower like China? But where I was presented with the truth, the lived experience of our fisherfolk, the very people who are working in quiet dignity, and when I realised there are actual threats to our freedom and our food security, we had no choice but to embrace the story.”Explore more on these topicsFilmPhilippinesChinaDocumentary filmsAsia PacificFishing industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereNaomi AldermanWed 10 Dec 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 10.02 ESTShareAfew days ago, I clicked a button on my phone to send funds to a company in Singapore and so took ownership of the video game I co-created and am lead writer for:Zombies, Run!I am a novelist, I wrote the bestselling, award-winning The Power, which was turned into an Amazon Prime TV series starring Toni Collette. What on earth am I doing buying a games company?Well. First of all.Zombies, Run! is special. It’s special to me – the game started as a Kickstarter and the community that grew up around it has always been incredibly supportive of what we’re doing. And it’s special in what it does. It’s a game to exercise with. You play it on your smartphone – iPhone or Android – and we tell stories from the zombie apocalypse in your headphones to encourage you to go further, faster, or just make exercise less boring. Games are so often portrayed as the bad entertainment form, but I made a game that fundamentally helps people to be healthier.The experience of playing Zombies, Run! is also completely focused on storytelling. My co-creator Adrian Hon and I were talking about doing a project together. He said: “Let’s do something to make running more fun.” I said: “How about if we do a story where you’re being chased by zombies?” And here we are.When you play the game, you’re immersed in a world where every run makes you a hero – you’re collecting supplies, saving a child from no man’s land, investigating the mystery of how the apocalypse started. I’ve always focused on the storytelling being good. And it works. Players of the game become so attached to the characters that many of them report laughing out loud or even “crying while running”.One of my jokes about storytelling in video games is that the way we tend to talk about it – in the games industry, in games journalism, even in marketing copy – is very much “never mind the quality, feel the width”. We say things like “this game has 100-plus hours of story” or “this game contains more than a million words”. Imagine marketing a movie saying that the script contains 29,000 words. Or selling a novel on the basis that it’ll take a long time to read.View image in fullscreenChasing the narrative … Zombies, Run!Illustration: Simon Garbutt/Zombies Run! LtdThat’s not how you do it. You tell the story. You give a hook. You say: “A single woman comes home one evening to find a man claiming to be her husband living in her house. And when he goes up to the attic, a different husband comes down in his place.” Now you can’t wait to find out what happens next. (That, incidentally, is the brilliant comic novelThe Husbands by Holly Gramazio– who I think is the only other bestselling novelist to be also making her own video games.)So, now I own a games company, what am I going to do? My feeling is that I must focus on the fundamentals. There’s a world of games out there that thinks it can replace writers with AI large language models. I think that’s going to make writing worse and worse. AI writing is fine for boilerplate text that is always roughly the same. It’s fine for non-writers to get their expertise into the world. But storytelling is different. It is human minds finding companionship with other human minds – we need stories, fundamentally, to feel less alone. To know that other people have been through things a bit like what we have. Things that make us laugh, and cry, even while running. You get that from work that is not the same as everything else, you get it from the unique work of other individual human minds.And actually, Zombies, Run! has always been a universe with strong values. We’re not a rightwing, rugged-individualism apocalypse, where one lone person can get through with just their guns. In our world – as in the real world – humans survive by working together.While we’re still going to have many exciting fleeing zombies, battling-the-undead storytelling, I think there’s probably also room in the ZR! universe for a 10-mission arc where you have to find all the figurines and paints you need to complete an expansion set in “Demons and Darkness”; or one where you’re working on bringing an overgrown garden back to blooming, beautiful life; or setting up and running the first post-apocalyptic travelling library while also trying to work out what happened to the first librarian who’s mysteriously disappeared, leaving only a series of cryptic notes in an old manuscript.After all, I do think this is quite a good time in the world to be thinking about how to rebuild after a series of catastrophic events.Selling story by the yard and not by a story hook is a marker, I think, of a lack of confidence in the form. We don’t need to lack confidence. Games arethe biggest entertainment industryin the world. If we want to be taken seriously, we need to take ourselves seriously. Stop talking about the width, start talking about the quality.What to playView image in fullscreenShoot everything that moves … Evil Egg.Photograph: Ivy SlyIt was the 20th anniversary of Xbox 360 recently, and one name that’s cropped up in every list of the console’s best games is the compulsive retro twin-stick shooter Geometry Wars. If you’re yearning for something similar, you must immediately downloadEvil Egg, a frenzied twin-stick blaster with gorgeous Commodore 64-style visuals and sound effects. Shoot everything that moves, hit the left trigger to boost and collect hearts to stay alive.At first it’s a bewildering mass of rainbow pixels but as you detonate wave after wave of glitchy space pests, you begin to understand the patterns of different enemies and earn upgrades such as the executioner’s sword, which takes out foes in an orbital slash of laser particles. Evil Egg is polished, exciting, wild to look at, and has such a brilliant understanding of the genre and its unique dynamics. It’s free on Steam but I implore you todownload it on Itch.ioand name your own price.Keith StuartAvailable on:PCEstimated playtime:10-plus hoursskip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I particularly enjoyedthis postby writer Harper Jay MacIntyre, which considers Horses, formalism and the trans experience. The article manages to bring in so many elements of modern games criticism and academia while providing a highly personal response to the game.The most interesting retro game articles are the ones that reassess lost or derided titles rather than merely celebrate the classics. Was the Atari 2600 version ofPac-Manthe worst game ever? Not according tothis compelling analysisfrom Garrett Martin at AV Club who sees it as a misunderstood brutalist gem. I find myself in agreement.It is also nice to see a legendary game justly praised in an interesting way.

But his music is quite different: a slippery layer cake of samples, multitudinous keys and lo-fi pop production, with Brown singing of a world where “the ebb and flow isn’t ebbing right”, be it in love or civic life. There is still room for an instant-classic R&B ballad though, in Tossed Away.Ben Beaumont-Thomas49Rochelle Jordan – Through the WallEverything isjust soon the British Canadian producer’s sixth album: expensively plush deep house suggesting club lights low, gleaming mirrors, potent looks igniting across the dancefloor. As much as the cold beat and ballroom flow of Ladida or the slapping “body, body, body” incantations of On 2 Something suggest a steadfast commitment to abandon, Jordan maintains impeccable poise and control throughout, whether in diva mode on Words 2 Say, breaking hearts on Bite the Bait, standing up for her needs on Doing It Too (“I’m not too much / You just give too little”) or patiently waiting for a frustrated lover to see the light on Ladida. Commanding, wise and committed to atmospheric excellence, party hosts don’t come better.Laura Snapes48Jerskin Fendrix– Once Upon a Time … in ShropshireView image in fullscreenHarebrained prog cabaret … Jerskin Fendrix.Photograph: Tim GuttJerskin Fendrix’s high-profile scores for the last three Yorgos Lanthimos films can’t really help prime you for the Midlands composer’s eccentrically beautiful second album, which pairs pristine musical theatre with the harebrained prog cabaret of Faith No More and (particularly) the under-sung Morphine. At first, Once Upon a Time … casts the rural bliss of growing up in 00s Shropshire in a golden light, a haven of getting ratted on Baileys and listening to Kanye on a farm, then having a lovely hungover group breakfast in someone’s kitchen. But the unexpected deaths he has experienced in recent years intrude to spoil paradise, eliciting feverish, absurdist expressions of grief – Jerskin Fendrix Freestyle is a bravura wig-out – and fathomless devastation from his camp, craggy voice. It demands a full theatrical production.LS47Clipping– Dead Channel SkyClipping frontman Daveed Diggs is best known for being in the original cast of Hamilton, and for all that this album is filled with noisy industrial rap, you can easily imagine it being successfully adapted for the Broadway stage. Dead Channel Sky is set in a cyberpunk dystopia not dissimilar to the scorched-sun “real world” of the Matrix, humming with janky tech and populated with fascists and freaky hedonists. Producers William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes render it in acid squiggles and revving breakbeats, while Diggs delivers his mutoid poetry like a prophet jacked up on some amphetamine he’s synthesised in a backstreet lab.BBTTell us your favourite albums of 2025Read more46The Tubs – Cotton CrownIn different hands,the Tubs’ second album might be a crushing listen, and understandably so. In 2014, frontman Owen Williams’ mother, the songwriter and author Charlotte Greig,died by suicide. Grief, as these songs detail, made him a rubbish boyfriend. But Cotton Crown is often funny and ardent, and especially self-aware about how new love might feel like a life raft to a depressed mind ill-equipped to reciprocate: “Know it’s all in my brain / Caught in the middle of loving you and being insane,” Williams sings on Fair Enough. His striking voice, somewhere between Richard Thompson and Bob Mould, bolts through the band’s joyful jangle-pop. Clear students of the form, they’re virtuosos with zero patience for perfection, their riffs hurtling and plundering like seagulls going at a spilled catch as they vigorously rough you up with profundity.LS45Smerz – Big City LifeView image in fullscreenAn album of stilted beauty … Smerz.Photograph: Alva Le FebvreCatharina Stoltenberg and Henriette Motzfeldt feel like the pop girlies of the incredibly prolific and off-kilterCopenhagen Rhythmic Music Conservatory scene, making music that’s more outward-facing and arch than some of their insular and traditional (and equally great) classmates. Their second album lurches between throwing yourself at life – “you’re a girl in the city and you shouldn’t think twice”, they chant in deadpan harmony on Roll the Dice – and actually thinking twice quite a lot in existential spirals about purpose and desire. The dissonance between confidence and anxiety comes through in the album’s stilted beauty: one minute, their whorls of prepared piano carry you along like clouds amid perfectly turned pop-R&B and balladry; then they stab and stutter, like cracks in the pavement destined to trap your heels. In 2023, K-pop’s brightest hopes NewJeans hired them as co-writers: more pop bearing their imprint can only be a good thing.LS44Sabrina Carpenter – Man’s Best FriendReleased almost exactly a year after her superstar-minting breakthrough Short n’ Sweet, and using a palette of soft rock, 80s pop, light disco and yearning country melodies, Carpenter added rich colour to one of pop’s most distinctive self-portraits. Her blatant sexuality is offset by an ironising sense of camp and a deep streak of cynicism, as she wonders whether to wrap her little finger round a series of hot but useless men. But whether dialling her exes while hopped up on “go-go juice” or being toxic for the sport of it (“you think that I’m gonna fuck with your head / well, you’re absolutely right”), Carpenter knows she’s part of the problem. Her fake helplessness at her own worst impulses is just one part of a formidable screwball comedy arsenal – she’s a Rosalind Russell for the dating app era.BBT43Jennifer Walton – DaughtersView image in fullscreenBolt from the blue … Jennifer Walton.Photograph: Liam CosfordThis Sunderland producer’s previous work included one EP of power electronics, one of antic club tracks, collabs with Aya and 96 Back as Microplastics, gigging with Kero Kero Bonito and a smattering of other credits. So her staggering, fully formed songwriterly debut was a total bolt from the blue. A swarming orchestral epic with shades of Julia Holter and Phil Elverum, it addressed her grief for her late father in serenely surrealist images – hitting a deer with a car in the middle of the night – and the painfully mundane realism of sitting in hospital corridors together. The standout Miss America combined both to stunning effect, a numbed incantation of everything Walton had seen on the US trip where she learned of her father’s diagnosis, the familiar now remade horribly mythic.LS42Erika de Casier– LifetimeErika de Casier’s fourth album updates the Y2K R&B template that fought for body-to-body sensuality in the face of rising digital creep. The old-school dial tones that pierce Lifetime’s rapt, liquid atmosphere work both as Janet homage and ironic sigh at how good those forebears had it when emotional warfare could only be conducted via pager: “Took a screenshot so / I could look at your pretty face all the time now / Without a sign that I’m online,” de Casier sings on earworm Delusional, a low-slung anthem for contemporary dating anxiety. “Hit midnight / Not even a text to hold me warm,” she rues on The Chase. That’s one of the most inviting things about Lifetime: its seductively cool surfaces conceal de Casier frantically kicking her feet below the surface, just like the rest of us.LS41Danny Brown – StardustThe Detroit rapper’s first post-rehab record totally disprovedhis fearsthat sobriety makes artists boring. On Stardust, Brown is still hard-wired with cartoonish verve, coupled with a genuinely touching sense of gratitude: “Sleeping real good at night ’cos I’m proud of myself,” he raps on Book of Daniel. While you probably wouldn’t describe someone who ponders “going bonkers and knocking out your chompers” as a wise elder, his hunger for life, opportunity and unmediated sensation blares through in how evidently gagged he is to centre younger producers from the digicore and hyperpop undergrounds: his unruly kids 8485, Jane Remover, Underscores, Frost Children and more make Stardust trip with glitch, rave, squealing riffs and overdriven noise. The rare record that makes you want to riot and shed a smiling single tear emoji.LS40-3140YHWH Nailgun – 45 PoundsView image in fullscreenChews you up … YHWH Nailgun.Photograph: Steve GullickIn 21 minutes, the New York band’s debut chews you up and spits you out the other side in a tentacular whirr of rototoms, guitars that shriek and whine like neglected machinery, erratic tempos and frontman Zack Borzone’s choked-out vocals. The way the record lurches and reels brings to mind the classic horror film scene in which a human undergoes a violent, magnificent transformation into some sort of beast: much like Gilla Band’s Most Normal, 45 Pounds is a font of mutant rock pleasures.LS39Sudan Archives – The BPMThe title refers to the beats per minute of dance music, but for an album that is so totally alive, it surely also refers to a pounding heart. Sudan Archives (AKA Angeleno producer-singer-songwriter-violinist Brittney Parks) announces that “life’s a game and I got VR goggles” as she revels in the epicurean joys of sex, dancing, travel and music itself with an almost superhuman appetite: “The rest are cowards / They choose to eat and we devour.” It’s all done with breezy good humour but there’s something inspiring, even quietly political about this mindful rejection of the straight life. Her backings – full of pop-R&B and ethereal electro – also dart away from obvious mainstream paths.BBT38Ethel Cain – Willoughby Tucker, I’ll Always Love YouView image in fullscreenRomantic slowcore … Ethel Cain.Photograph: Dollie KyarnIt’s easy to see why US singer-songwriter Cain has become so adored. This album further sketches out the kind of storytelling universe that attracts footnote-writing fandoms: it’s a prequel to the events of her debut album Preacher’s Daughter, deepening the tale of Ethel and a cast of young peers as they fumble towards connection and understanding. Her moody, romantic slowcore is also perfect music for listening to on headphones as you walk around boring suburban streets wishing you could leave for bigger things. It’s also great for road trips: songs between five and 15 minutes that seem to make a long, slow blur of the pell-mell world outside.BBT37Olivia Dean – The Art of LovingThe British breakthrough of the year, as Dean – already doing decent business with her pleasant but rather neat debut Messy – reached a completely new level of songcraft. Bossa nova, folk and soul (classic and neo) are warmed together with beautiful production, evaporating any sense of pastiche to make a sound that’s both easy on the ear but distinctly Dean’s. Every song has a superb top line, Dean stretching them into loose jazzy shapes (Let Alone the One You Love, Lady Lady) or tightening them into brisk pop (Man I Need, Something Inbetween). But it’s the lyrics that make these songs so red-blooded: every stage of love, from the first flutter of flirtation to the adrenal shock of rejection, is made so true to life.BBT36Anna von Hausswolff – IconoclastsView image in fullscreenSense of awe … Anna von Hausswolff.Photograph: Philip SvenssonAnna von Hausswolff is no stranger to a monumental statement: her primary instrument is the pipe organ,a towering edifice of tin and arsenicthat offers her an ever-renewing sense of awe. But the Swedish composer’s sixth album goes bigger than ever, grappling with mortality, transcendence and evil in a series of stormy epics that also lash a little pop structure to her prow. “Oh, I’m breaking up with language / Oh, in search of something bigger than this,” she screams on Stardust, an exhilarating co-pilot on the path to absolution.LS35Bon Iver – Sable, FableIf, as Justin Vernon recently suggested, this is the last ever Bon Iver album, it’s a beautiful redemption arc: a loving send-up of his anxious, myopic sad-sack self blossoms into a radiant appreciation of possibility, sensuality, risk. Everything Is Peaceful Love has one of the year’s best refrains: “Damn if I’m not climbing up a tree right now!”, giddy with thrill and absolutely no idea of what to do when you get up there other than enjoy the view. And while there are gorgeously passionate songs here, it’s the ones about gracefully letting go of an unviable love that really underscore the admirable humility in Vernon’s bowing out.LS34Snocaps – SnocapsKatie Crutchfield’s full-throated transformation into country doyenne on her last couple of albums as Waxahatchee almost makes it easy to forget her indie-rock origins. Fourteen years since she and twin sister Allison wound down their teen band PS Eliot, the DIY stalwarts got back together – with a little help from MJ Lenderman and producer Brad Cook – and went back to brass tacks for their surprise album as Snocaps. What a treat it was: full of punchy indignation – “I could never just …coast!” they exclaim on Coast – crunchy ruminations and sing-songy contemplations of what it means to depend on and grow alongside one another. You’d follow them anywhere.LS33Amaarae – Black StarView image in fullscreenIrrepressible … Amaarae.Photograph: Salomé Gomis-TreziseWe all need an Amaarae in our lives: the person who, when you weakly protest that you’re a bit tired to go out, will soon have you holding a bottle of decanted rum in the back of an Uber, while alongside you she looks quizzically at a series of resealable plastic bags. “Ketamine, coke and molly,” she chants on Starkilla; “I spiked this drink so please open your mouth,” she tells her lover on Fineshyt. And this club-ready album from the irrepressible Ghanaian-American pop star ends up being a sensual body high, as she chases sex and glamour into the ends of the night.BBT32Perfume Genius – GloryWith typical grace and humour Mike Hadreas sends up his self-defeating tendencies on his seventh album, and wonders how old you have to be to escape those lifelong patterns: like the contradiction of struggling to face the world while also fantasising about violence and romanticising “all the poems I’ll get out” of it. It feels apt that Glory starts with the western twang of It’s a Mirror, suggesting a fixed, brawny masculine archetype – then breaks it down over the course of the record, a gothic, celestial voyage into the interior, and the latest addition to a uniquely beautiful American songbook.LS31Horsegirl – Phonetics On and OnView image in fullscreenFinely tuned … Horsegirl.Photograph: Ruby FayeSpindly rock à la the Velvets and the Raincoats is as spartan in its constituent parts as it is high on reward, and Chicago trio Horsegirl demonstrated the inexhaustible pleasures of this 60-year-old form on their second album. With production from Cate Le Bon, they wove magic from just a few thrumming guitar and bass notes and Nora Cheng’s nonchalant, near-spoken vocals, as well as a knack for melodic hooks as finely turned as intricate woodwork: the bittersweet, skipping chorus of Information Content is an all-timer.LS30-2130Oklou – Choke EnoughTrance, medieval polyphony and Y2K pop may seem like odd bedfellows, but French singer-producer Oklou cast them all in a dawn-like haze on her gorgeous debut album, flowing these distinct disciplines together until they swooped and soared like a flock of starlings. Choke Enough was no academic exercise, either, with standout pop moments including Take Me By the Hand with Bladee – a winsome conjuring of how Alice Deejay might sound in collaboration with a piping minstrel.LS29Jacob Alon – In LimerenceView image in fullscreenRustling with life … Jacob Alon performing at the ZYN Rolling Stone UK Awards, in London’s Roundhouse.Photograph: Sue Moore/Hogan Media/ShutterstockOne of the star-making moments of the year was at the Mercury prize, as Scottish singer-songwriter Jacob Alon reduced the arena audience to a hush with just a voice and an acoustic guitar (though there were delighted whoops when a call of “free Palestine” was folded into their rendition of Fairy in a Bottle). It hopefully brought a broader audience to their debut album In Limerence, which has shades of Adrianne Lenker, Jeff Buckley and even Paul McCartney’s cadences to its unguarded indie-folk. It would have been easy to make this music blandly beautiful, but Alon and producer Dan Carey keep it rustling with life, as they reach for a burbling synth, trumpet improvisation or dusty-sounding drum kit.BBT28KeiyaA – Hooke’s LawThe title of the Chicago producer’s second album references the law of physics that reflects how stretch is proportional to load, how a spring always bounces back when tested within its elastic limit. The whistlestop Hooke’s Law expands and contracts accordingly as KeiyaA’s trifles with loss and romantic disappointment find their embodiment in racing breakbeats and collagist chaos one minute, gorgeous, soul-weary stillness – as with the liquid Stupid Prizes – the next. Listening can feel like being pleasurably blitzed with sensation, with each repeat revealing new details: an invitation to submit to KeiyaA’s masterful grip.LS27Wet Leg – MoisturizerIn 2022 they released one of the 21st century’s biggest indie debuts, which scored a UK No 1 and Grammy and Brit awards. The pressure was there for the follow-up, but not only did it top the charts again and earn another couple of Grammy noms, it had even more swagger and heart. “You wanna fuck me, I know, most people do,” Rhian Teasdale shrugs on Mangetout, and she actively intimidates a lustful bloke on Catch These Fists – but much of the album is given over to her wonderment at falling in love. “I’ll be your Davina, I’m coming to get you … I’ll be your Shakira, whenever, wherever”, she sings: great new vows for millennial weddings.BBT26Wolf Alice – The ClearingView image in fullscreenSomething symphonic … Ellie Rowsell of Wolf Alice performing at Manchester Arena.Photograph: Andy Von Pip/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock“English bands are so hesitant to ever admit ambition, but I am ambitious with this record,” Wolf Alice’s drummerJoel Amey saidas The Clearing was announced – and sure enough, this was a huge step up and out for a band who were already one of British indie’s biggest. There’s something symphonic about the heft of it and not just because of the string sections, thanks to superb production by Greg Kurstin: the bass and toms are heavy yet warm, the piano pounding yet not overbearing. Ellie Rowsell sings about suitably big themes, too, from universe-bending love on Leaning Against the Wall (“it really, really made the room sing, the way you said my name”), invaluable friendship on Just Two Girls, and The Sofa’s uplifting manifesto for being wild and indolent instead of toeing the line.BBT25Wednesday – BleedsThe North Carolina band’s sixth album is littered with endings, some violent – the title of Carolina Murder Suicide tells you all you need to know – some devastatingly mundane, as Karly Hartzman examined the cracks that led to a long relationship’s end. Her unique gaze unites both, noticing the details and dynamics that other songwriters might write off as inconsequential: like the “mounted antlers in the kitchen on a crooked nail” at a wake in Wound Up Here (By Holdin On). Full of screaming noise and riffs that evoke knee-sliding through the mud, as well as moments of unexpected sweetness, Bleeds shows the fullest picture of her band yet.LS24Titanic – HagenView image in fullscreenUncontainable euphoria … Mabe Fratti and Hector Tosta of Titanic.Photograph: Janet ChauThere can be few faster-evolving ensembles than that of Mabe Fratti and Hector Tosta, who in just two albums have leapt from sparkling cabaret jazz to … whatever the uncontainable euphoria of Hagen is. It’s a record that vaults from blast beats to choral beauty, eerie splendour to nervy cacophonies, like nothing else you’ve heard. Despite these bold stylistic clashes, it hangs together beautifully, thanks also to Fratti’s spectacular voice, as capable of cirrus-like delicacy as parched sharpness.LS23Cate Le Bon – Michelangelo DyingWhere two of this year’s most prominent breakup albums were savage (Lily Allen) or spectacular (Rosalía), Welsh innovator Cate Le Bon’s hypnotically murky seventh album reflected the circular sadness of love faltering – the catch-22 of wanting to escape heartbreak while knowing that letting go means relinquishing something that was once profound. Michelangelo Dying contains some of her very best choruses and melodies, powerful enough to penetrate the album’s billowing haze of guitar, sax and synths, like a hand reaching out in the dark.LS22Little Simz – LotusView image in fullscreenWider reckoning … Little Simz performing at the Co-op Live arena in Manchester.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianSimz’s sixth album came amid a dispute with the Sault producer Inflo – she has sued him for allegedly failing to repay a loan – and a couple of tracks target him in all but name (“You talk about God when you have a God complex / I think you’re the one that needs saving”). But Simz seems to be having a wider reckoning: she revels in how far she’s come from once just having “a dream and a pushbike”, and reflects on self-preservation, creative frustration and – in a gorgeous, naturalistic back-and-forth with Wretch 32 – push-pull family dynamics.BBT21John Glacier – Like a RibbonFor all that you can link her to trip-hop and cloud rap, what British MC has ever really sounded like this? It would be easy to call Glacier monotone, but in truth her careful, even flow holds so much musicality: her deliberately limited melodic and rhythmic range means that the subtle distinctions in her vocals are fascinating, as she goes from bored to wry to boastful to poignant within one-degree turns on the emotional thermostat. The grainy, faintly corrupted beats are superb, but it’s that delivery, and her lyrics themselves – stoic and even amused as life blows her from place to place – which make this album an all-timer in UK rap.BBT20-11 coming soonCome back tomorrow for the next 10 albums in the countdown!

Other Brontës are on tap – Anne is a traditional ale, Charlotte an IPA, Branwell a porter – but the barman says Emily, an amber ale with a “malty biscuit flavour”, is the most popular. It’s the obvious choice today, anyway: in a few hours, Oscar-winning film-maker Emerald Fennell will be at the Brontë women’s writing festival in a church just up the road, discussing her adaptation of Emily’s 19th-century gothic masterpieceWuthering Heights.The film, to be released just before Valentine’s Day next year, is already scandal-ridden. It all started withFennell’s castingof Hollywood stars Jacob Elordi and Margot (“Heathcliff, it’s me, it’s Barbie”) Robbie causing uproar. An eroticteaser trailerfull of tight bodices, cracking whips and sweaty bodies had the same effect. But heads were really sent spinning by reports of a scene with a public hanging and a nun who “fondles the corpse’s visible erection”.One early review said readers would be shocked and disgusted by the book’s cruelty, inhumanity and diabolical hateSince my visit to Haworth, the full trailer has been released, showing Fennell’s brand of anachronistic sets and costumes (think sugary, eye-popping interiors and red latex gowns), some suggestive licking and bread-kneading, and Elordi’s (admittedly quite good)Yorkshireaccent: “So kiss me – and let us both be damned!”Such a wild response was only to be expected. As I drink up and step out into the cobbled streets of this village built on a hill, Wuthering Heights’ potency is still palpable.View image in fullscreenControversial casting … Jacob Elordi and Margot Robbie in the forthcoming adaptation.Photograph: Warner Bros“I sometimes feel, in the morning, that I could just walk around the corner and the sisters would be there talking to each other,” Diane Park tells me over a coffee in Wave of Nostalgia, heraward-winningfeminist bookshop. “They are still so alive here in this village.” Park’s shop sits near the top of the hill, on a road lined with terraced stone houses and quirky independent businesses. Seconds away is a lane leading to the church where the Brontës’ father Patrick was reverend. Behind it is a cluttered graveyard and the Brontë parsonage, where the family lived.When Park moved here more than a decade ago, she had only read Charlotte’s Jane Eyre. Today, she reads one of Emily’s poems to me on the shopfloor: “Hope, whose whisper would have given / Balm to all my frenzied pain …” How did she feel when she first read Wuthering Heights? “I was blown away by Emily’s insight into the soul.”The world was scandalised when Emily published it, under a male pseudonym, in 1847. It is the story of fiery Catherine Earnshaw and her relationship with outcast orphan Heathcliff, in whom she finds her match as they roam the Yorkshire moors: “He’s more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.”When Catherine marries Edgar Linton and dies, it sets haunted Heathcliff on a path of vengeance, as the second half of the novel becomes a story of control, abuse and digging up graves. While some critics admired its unique strangeness, many echoed onereviewthat said: “The reader is shocked, disgusted, almost sickened by details of cruelty, inhumanity and the most diabolical hate.”View image in fullscreen‘Never mind the Brontës’ … a view from the sisters’ home town.Photograph: David Zdanowicz/ShutterstockThis didn’t stop Wuthering Heights from becoming a classic. It was made intoa silent moviein 1920, withlocals crowding around the shootin Haworth and playing extras. The story later moved to a Hollywood studio and enjoyed the romanticised Golden Age treatment with Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon, minus that more problematic second act. And at least 15 big and small screen adaptations have followed, from Yoshishige Yoshida’s 1988 retelling in medieval Japan, to Andrea Arnold’s2011 versionwith James Howson as the first black actor to play Heathcliff. (The main criticism levelled against the casting of Elordi is that Heathcliff is widely considered not white in the book.)It was the BBC’s full-story 1967 series, starring Ian McShane as a brooding Heathcliff, that inspired Kate Bush to write her otherworldly hit, which brought Wuthering Heights into every home. “I just managed to catch the very last few minutes, where there was a hand coming through the window and blood everywhere and glass,”she has said, admitting she wrote the song before reading the book.So why does this story of passion-ravaged lovers on rain-ravaged moors have such a hold? “I think Wuthering Heights endures because the relationships between Cathy, Heathcliff and Edgar aren’t easy to quantify,” says authorJuno Dawson, who grew up in Bingley and calls the Brontës “the pride of Yorkshire”. Dawson was inspired by Wuthering Heights to write a short story for an anthology called I Am Heathcliff. “They don’t fit into traditional notions of a romance novel or a ghost story,” she continues. “And each character is frustrating, unfathomable. If there’s something I take from it, it’s that ambiguity can be as satisfying as neat resolution.”I stroll over to where the Brontës lived, mingling with fellow visitors – mostly solo women whom I later spot at Fennell’s talk. “People have always come to make a pilgrimage,” says Rebecca Yorke, director of the parsonage and theBrontë Society, which opened in 1928. “If you look at the visitors book, there’ll be a mixture of UK, USA, Australia, Japan and Europe. About a third of our visitors are from overseas.” There are famous signatures too, from Sylvia Plath to Patti Smith.This is actually my third visit, or pilgrimage, to the parsonage with my mum. It just keeps pulling us back. Today we learn that the trees in the garden separating it from the graveyard only grew after the Brontës’ time here. So the family would have had views of death on one side and endless moors on the other. The rooms are quite claustrophobic and downstairs is where they wrote their novels, on a table that has an “E” etched on it. In the corner is the sofa on which Emily died, most likely of tuberculosis, aged just 30. The life expectancy in Haworth was a mere 24, partly due to the overcrowded graveyard contaminating the drinking water. Such details from this place’s past still feel compelling in the present, especially when it comes to the author of Wuthering Heights.“Emily is quite enigmatic,” says Yorke. “We don’t know as much about her as we do about Charlotte. And Wuthering Heights was her only novel – but it’s one of the best-known in the English language.” How, then, to square this woman described as peculiar, introverted and nonconformist, with the literary genius who created a novel so haunting, dark and poetic that it still fires people up today? As Charlotte said of her sister: “An interpreter ought always to have stood between her and the world.” So much so that Charlotte made efforts to “correct” Emily’s reputation after her death, further adding to the mystery.Top Withens, thought to be the inspiration for the fictional farmhouse that gives the novel its name, is now endangeredThe siblings have proven almost as popular as subjects for drama as their works, from Christopher Fry’s 1973 ITV series The Brontës of Haworth to Sally Wainwright’s 2016To Walk Invisiblefor the BBC. In 2022, Emily gota somewhat reimagined biopic, with a passionate portrayal by Emma Mackey, and a raunchy affair with a curate. With each new film or TV series, fresh hordes of tourists have flocked in to Haworth.Down the hill, a record shop with a “Never Mind the Brontë” poster is just one of many nods to the local celebrities. Other windows boast a lampshade made from book pages and paintings of the moors. Authors live locally, or come to stay for writing retreats, says Park: “There’s that creative feeling in Haworth.” But does the Brontë effect have any impact on local culture in ways beyond the obvious? It runs deeper, says Park, with things such as the nature sculptures at nearby Penistone Hill Country Park, part of Bradford’s year as City of Culture. “It feels like Emily is in the heather and the trees. You just breathe the air. Wuthering refers to weather and I just feel she’s left her print here.”View image in fullscreen‘The Brontës are still so alive here’ … Diane Park, owner of Haworth bookshop Wave of Nostalgia.Photograph: Wave of NostalgiaIt’s not just about tourism. Take last month’sWandering Imaginationsproject, which saw two young authors from Bradford and two from Ghana writing stories inspired by theBrontë siblings’ fictitious African kingdom Angria. “We’re here for the people that live here,” says Yorke. The society has just acquired a new building on the main street, where it will focus on “opportunities for local people to get closer to their heritage”. She hopes to further “instil that sense of pride in something on your doorstep, something people across the world think is worth visiting.”The event that ticks all the Brontë boxes, though, isthe Most Wuthering Heights Day Ever, held on 27 July each year. Hundreds of people dressed in floaty red dresses come together in spots around the nation to sing and dance to the Kate Bush song. This summer, at Penistone Hill, it also doubled as a campaign to protect Top Withens – thought to be the inspiration for the fictional windswept farmhouse that gives the novel its name – from a planned windfarm development.Of course, the beautiful Brontë country isn’t just for literary nerds. This has always been a rugged paradise for hikers andfell runners. The Tour de France pedalled through here in 2014, and inspired the Tour de Yorkshire. A moody walkway behind the parsonage leads to a waterfall named after the sisters, as they were said to spend time there. That magical feeling just gets stronger as you stomp around, retracing their tiny footsteps. “These heather-laden moors,” says Park, “call to you as much as they did to Emily, who roamed as free as Cathy.”View image in fullscreenFamily home … Haworth parsonage.Photograph: Richard Hilsden/AlamyNight falls in Haworth and I head to the packed church. The young woman sitting next to me is visiting from New York, staying in an inn for the whole festival weekend, which includes a writing workshop out on the moors the next day. Fennell walks out wearing a T-shirt with “The Brontë Sisters” stamped on it in gothic lettering, heavy-metal style.The book, she says, “cracked me open” after first reading it aged 14. She drew on that “primal, sexual” initial reaction for her film. What chimes most in the room, though, is how Fennell talks of Wuthering Heights speaking to her differently at various stages in her life. I recently read it again for the first time in 15 years and could not believe that I used to consider it at all sexy.Many others agree. “If you read it as a teenager,” says Yorke, “you might just think, ‘Oh my goodness, to experience a love and passion like that would just be amazing.’ And then, as you get older, you might think, ‘Actually, this isn’t very … healthy.’” Fennell goes further: “It’s so bonkers.”View image in fullscreen‘We know the least about Emily’ … from left, Anne, Emily and Charlotte, painted by their brother Branwell.Photograph: Granger Historical Picture Archive/AlamyPerhaps that’s why she also “did the dirty” with the book’s second half, dropping it and sticking to the love story. This may have been a missed opportunity to explore Heathcliff with more nuance – although it’s impossible to say at this point. But there is a call for more exploration of the novel’s highly debated and complicated relationship with race.‘There’s an enormous amount of sado-masochism in this book’: Emerald Fennell defends her Wuthering Heights adaptationRead moreEmily, who was well read, wrote it in the years after the abolition of slavery in the UK, and Heathcliff is found with no “owner” in Liverpool. Still, the film is Fennell’s version. “It’s very personal for everyone,” she says. “But I can’t make something for everyone: no one is in agreement about any element of it.”Fennell certainly isn’t scared to shock, but Dawson is unconcerned. “If anyone’s going to do it, I’m glad it’s Fennell,” says the author. “She’s a director who isn’t afraid to actually adapt, rather than photocopy from book to screen.”As I walk to my car in the dark, silence now enveloping the village and the moors, I remember something Park told me about Emily. “Her poetry gets so deep into your soul, into your heart,” she said. “I can’t express how alive it makes me feel.”Wuthering Heights will be released on 13 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsFilmWuthering HeightsEmily BrontëAnne BrontëCharlotte BrontëYorkshireYorkshire holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But was Tarantino’s pronouncement just bluster and flex? Will he end up casting Dano in his next film – a turnaround like Donald Trump making nice with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un after pretty much threatening him with nuclear war? Or are we witnessing a kind of midlife emotional crisis in the heart of one of the most brilliant directors of his generation? I speak as a superfan with reservations.In his recent podcast interview with the legendary controversial author Bret Easton Ellis – and therefore perhaps in a mood to provoke andépater les bourgeoisde la critique– Tarantino unveiled his top 20 best films of the 21st century. Asked why Paul Thomas Anderson’sThere Will Be Bloodwas only at number 5, Tarantino declared that Dano was the problem: “[Dano] is weak sauce, man. He is the weak sister … He’s just such a weak, weak, uninteresting guy.”Daniel Day-Lewis defends Paul Dano after Tarantino criticismRead moreHmm. This isn’t an accurate assessment of Dano. But it could be that Tarantino’s feelings about Anderson are in any case more complicated than that.The top 10 half of his picks is an almost ostentatiously normie list, a Letterboxd civilian list, in reverse order: Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris, Edgar Wright’s Shaun of the Dead, George Miller’s Mad Max: Fury Road, Tony Scott’s Unstoppable, David Fincher’s Zodiac, PTA’s There Will Be Blood, Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk, Sofia Coppola’s Lost in Translation, Lee Unkrich’s Toy Story 3 and Ridley Scott’s wartime action-thriller Black Hawk Down at the very top. Well, OK. No one should patronise a cinephile connoisseur like Tarantino by dismissing this selection as populist – almost all of them are absolutely great, although I am baffled by the inclusion of Tony Scott’sdire Unstoppable.Is Tarantino trolling the wokesters by including Woody Allen? I would have gone for Allen’s Blue Jasmine. I am not every bit as saucer-eyed about Miller’s Mad Max revivals as other people, but they’re certainly really good, and Scott’s Black Hawk Down is a wildly impressive two-hour-plus action sequence – but, please, Scott’s Gladiator is surely a better film, released in 2000, and only a pedant would say that doesn’t count as 21st century. As for the others: yes, absolutely great – and on a patriotic note, it’s nice to see Wright’s Shaun of the Dead, which way back at the beginning of the 00s revived self-respect for the British film industry.It is certainly not the hipster-obscure selection that you might expect, certainly from, say, reading Tarantino’s fascinating memoirCinema Speculation.The more recondite titles (and non-English-language titles) come in the 10 lower down, in reverse order from 20 to 11: Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story, Eli Roth’s Cabin Fever, Bennett Miller’s Moneyball, Prachya Pinkaew’s Chocolate, Rob Zombie’s The Devil’s Rejects, Mel Gibson’s The Passion of the Christ, Richard Linklater’s School of Rock, Jeff Tremaine’s Jackass: The Movie, Aharon Keshales and Navot Papushado’s Big Bad Wolves, and Kinji Fukasaku’s Battle Royale.That seems more to be the QT we know and love. There’s Fukasuku’s badass survival-reality masterpiece Battle Royale – which Tarantino correctly says was ripped off by the Hunger Games franchise – the Thai martial-arts actioner Chocolate and the Israeli horror-thriller Big Bad Wolves. I agree with Tarantino that Spielberg’s West Side Story is great (although here too Tarantino is a bit salty about the cast: “I couldn’t believe I liked the lead [Ansel Elgort] as I didn’t like him in anything else” ). I like his praise for Brad Pitt’s movie-star mystique in Moneyball, although Pitt is far better in Tarantino’s own Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. I’m not down with Roth’s Cabin Fever or Zombie’s tiresome Devil’s Rejects, and Gibson’s Passion is a non-sacred turkey fit only for the culture wars. Linklater’s School of Rock is great fun, but only a contorted inverse snobbery pose can put that in there and not Linklater’s real masterpiece, Boyhood.View image in fullscreenPaul Dano and Daniel Day-Lewis in Paul Thomas Anderson’s There Will Be Blood, 2007.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyBut we’re back toPaul Thomas Andersonand There Will Be Blood; Tarantino wouldn’t be human if he wasn’t aware of PTA’s status as a rival to his own and of Anderson as a film-maker who seems to be creating work with more fluency and productivity than Tarantino right now, and he might have picked a quarrel with Dano on the spur of the moment just to take PTA down a few pegs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This intriguing and amusing list, in which commercialism and cinephilia are such a complex mix, may in fact constitute the “movie critic” performance that his abandoned film was going to be.So how does Tarantino see himself now? Does he think he has one big masterpiece left in him? I think he does. More than one, probably. He has said he doesn’t want to go on past 10 films, having so far made nine, and said that a great master like Don Siegel should have quit while he was ahead after Escape from Alcatraz in 1979.But the time has come for QT to stop sulking in his tent, stop making irrelevant pronouncements on podcasts. Tarantino created this 10-film idea; he certainly can’t quit at nine films – but there’s an enormous amount of self-imposed pressure. This 10-and-no-more thing has pointlessly paralysed him, and his Dano outburst is just a symptom of that. My prediction is that Tarantino will go for an adaptation, his first since Jackie Brown: he will find a novel and supercharge the pulp with shock and flair. AndPaul Danowill be in it.Explore more on these topicsQuentin TarantinoPaul Thomas AndersonPaul DanocommentShareReuse this content"

She studied music at New College, Oxford, before switching to Philosophy, Politics and Economics. After graduation, she became a financial journalist, but she said she found the job dull. During the long commute to central London, she would read paperbacks by the likes of Mary Wesley and Joanna Trollope, and began wanting to write a book.At 24, she wrote her first novel, The Tennis Party, about a group of friends who take part in a weekend tournament. “My overriding concern was that I didn’t write the autobiographical first novel,” Wickhamtold the Guardianin 2012. “I was so, so determined not to write about a 24-year-old journalist. It was going to have male characters, and middle-aged people, so I could say, look, I’m not just writing about my life, I’m a real author.”The Tennis Party was the first of seven novels Wickham wrote under her real name, published yearly between 1995 and 2001, including Cocktails for Three, The Wedding Girl, Sleeping Arrangements and The Gatecrasher. Sleeping Arrangements was adapted as a musical by Chris Burgess.The Madeleine Wickham books are “rather different” from her later Sophie Kinsella books, said the author. “They’re a bit more serious, a bit darker and are all ensemble pieces without a main heroine, but groups of characters whose lives interlink in some way.”View image in fullscreenIsla Fisher in the film adaptation of Confessions of a Shopaholic.Photograph: Robert Zuckerman/APWickham submitted her first manuscript written under the name Sophie Kinsella, The Secret Dreamworld of a Shopaholic, without revealing her identity to her publishers. The book – issued as Confessions of a Shopaholic in some countries – was published in 2000 and became the first of 10 instalments in the Shopaholic series. The stories follow Becky Bloomwood, a financial journalist with a spending problem. “I thought, wait a minute, shopping has become the national pastime, and nobody has written about it,” said Wickham. “It felt very much like an experimental project.”The series’ first and second novels – the latter titled Shopaholic Abroad – were adapted for film. Confessions of a Shopaholic, directed by PJ Hogan and starring Isla Fisher and Hugh Dancy, was released in 2009.Beginning in 2003, Wickham also published standalone novels as Sophie Kinsella. These include Can You Keep a Secret?, The Undomestic Goddess and Remember Me?. Her most recent standalone, published in 2023, is titled The Burnout, which she was inspired to write after experiencing it herself and seeing it “around [her] everywhere”. Protagonist Sasha goes to a Devon beach resort she loved as a child to recuperate from burnout, but finds the once grand hotel now dilapidated, and has to share the beach with the grumpy Finn.“The wonderful response to The Burnout has really buoyed me up during a difficult time,” wrote Wickham in the announcement of her cancer diagnosis. Public messages of support came from Fisher, who played Becky inConfessions of a Shopaholic, as well as romance writer Moyes and thriller writer Gillian McAllister.Sophie Kinsella: ‘You can be highly intelligent – and also ditzy and klutzy’Read moreWickham’s novels have often been classified as “chick lit”, owing to the romcom-esque situations her often ditzy heroines find themselves in. Yet Wickham considered the term “chick lit” to mean “third-person contemporary funny” novels. “You can be highly intelligent, and also ditzy and klutzy,” said Wickham. “You can be unable to cook, you can like lipstick. And I think it’s more realistic to represent women having all these facets.”Wickham also created the children’s book series Mummy Fairy and Me, published between 2018 and 2020. In 2015, she wrote a young adult novel, Finding Audrey, about a teenage girl with social anxiety.Wickham met her husband, Henry Wickham, on her first night at Oxford University, and married him when she was 21. She is survived by her husband and their five children.Explore more on these topicsBooksSophie KinsellaRomance booksFictionnewsShareReuse this content"

During this broadcast, comments were made alleging that the lead singer of Bob Vylan led antisemitic chants.”The firm lodged documents at the high court in Dublin on behalf of Robinson-Foster and the drummer Wade Laurence George.Darragh Mackin, one of the firm’s solicitors, said:“Our clients are no stranger to utilising their freedom of expression to speak out against the genocide in Gaza. There is, however, a fundamental distinction between speaking critically about the role of the Israeli state forces, and being antisemitic.“The former is speech within the confines of political expression, whereas the latter is a form of hatred directed towards Jewish people. At no stage have our clients ever engaged in conduct that is remotely antisemitic and to that end, have had no option but to seek the formal correction of same via the remedies available within this litigation.”Despite requests for a retraction and apology, RTÉ had failed to “address the harm caused” and proceedings had been issued to seek redress for the “significant reputational and emotional damage” to Bob Vylan, said the firm. The broadcast’s wide dissemination to a national and online audience had aggravated the impact on the band’s reputation and professional standing, it said.When contacted, RTÉ said it did not comment on legal proceedings.Robinson-Foster’s chant about the IDF, which was livestreamed by the BBC as part of its Glastonbury coverage on 28 June, caused uproar. The BBC apologised for transmitting “such offensive and deplorable behaviour” and its complaints unit found that the corporationbreached editorial guidelines.Avon and Somerset police opened a criminal investigation and last monthquestioned a man in his 30s– who was not named or arrested – and he attended a voluntary police interview under caution.The Community Security Trust (CST), a Jewish community safety and monitoring organisation, said reports of antisemitic incidents in the UKspikedthe day after the band’s performance.While visiting Dublin for a gig last month the duo met pro-Palestinian politicians at the Irish parliament at the invitation of Eoin Ó Broin, a legislator with the opposition Sinn Féin party.Explore more on these topicsBob VylanIrelandDefamation lawEuropeMedia lawIsrael-Gaza warGlastonbury 2025newsShareReuse this content"

Their findings stressed that the riverside balcony targeted by the thieves was a weak point and could be easily reached with an extendable ladder – exactly what transpired in the heist.Corbin confirmed that the Louvre director, Laurence des Cars, had not been aware of the audit, which was ordered by her predecessor Jean-Luc Martinez. “The recommendations were not acted on and they would have enabled us to avoid this robbery,” Corbin said, adding that there had been a lack of coordination between the two government-appointed administrators.Police believe they have arrested all four intruders, who escaped on motorbikes having carried out the heist in the Apollo Gallery in about 10 minutes in total, according to the investigation.The revelations are likely to pile more pressure on Des Cars, the first woman in the role, who was appointed by Emmanuel Macron in 2021. Questions have swirled since the break-in over whether it was avoidable and why the world’s most-visited museum appeared to be so poorly protected.France’s lower house of parliament is carrying out its own inquiry, while Des Cars and Martinez are due to be questioned by senators next week. Last month, France’s state auditor said security upgrades had been carried out at a “woefully inadequate pace” and the museum had prioritised “high-profile and attractive operations” instead of protecting itself.Guy Tubiana, a senior police officer and security adviser at the culture ministry who took part in the investigation, told senators he was “stunned” by what he had discovered at the museum. “There was a succession of malfunctions that led to catastrophe but I never would have thought the Louvre could have so many malfunctions,” he said.Staff at the Louvre are expected to go on strike on Monday to demand management act against what they see as understaffing and overcrowding at the museum, which welcomed 8.7 million people last year.At the weekend, the museum revealed thata water leakhad damaged 300 to 400 journals, books and documents in the Egyptian department in late November.Explore more on these topicsParisFranceMuseumsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

There was folding, laughing and helping with cuts. Titles like Narcan 101, Free Palestine and An American Zine, filled with illustrations and tips, lined a table down the hall.While this may sound like a scene from the 1980s or 1990s – when zines were popular as a countercultural form of expression – this was a workshop in modern-day Los Angeles, where immigration raids and federal threats have left residents restless and scared.Zines have made a resurgence in recent months as communities seek to share information, such as how to protect one another from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or how to resist the Trump administration outside No Kings protests. Just this week,404 Mediaannounced it is printing a 16-page zine that includes their reporting on ICE. People of all ages, from all regions, are making, printing and distributing zines on the streets, in libraries and at local gathering spots.We asked critics from authoritarian regimes what they wish they’d known sooner. Here’s what they saidRead moreZine-makers and enthusiasts say that people are likely embracing the pen-and-paper medium again due to social media censorship, surveillance, doxing and the alleged suppression of certain topics on algorithms.View image in fullscreenZines made and illustrated by Megan Piontkowski.Photograph: Megan Piontkowski“There’s a freedom people are craving because they’re feeling so constrained, surveilled and, frankly, threatened in so many other spheres that exist,” said Mariame Kaba, the co-founder of theBlack Zine Fairin Brooklyn, who has been making zines since the 1980s. “You can print it cheaply, copy it, and make it into something, then you can give them out by the thousands to people in your community. There’s no barrier to entry, and that makes a difference.”In particular, Kaba pointed to Brooklyn illustrator Megan Piontkowski’s series ofHow to Report ICE zines, a simple black-and-white one-page pdf document that requires four folds and a cut in the middle to aid folding. This zine has gone viral on Bluesky and Google Drive, where Piontkowski houses over 70 versions of her pamphlet in English and Spanish with localized rapid response hotlines and resources for cities and states across the US. She makes these zines in her spare time – fielding dozens of requests for other locations – to use her art to lend support.“I really hate feeling powerless when horrible things are happening around me,” said Piontkowski, who drew inspiration from Kaba to make the zine. “It’s something I can do, and it’s also something other people can do. If they’re very vulnerable, ill, on a visa, or have a small child and they can’t protest, they can still fold some zines. You could do it at home, and hand them out to your friends or people you know at the grocery store or cafe.”Zine-folding parties have also become popular in recent months. After ICE launched Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago in September, resident Emily Hilleren saw local social media posts where people packaged whistles with thePilsen Arts and Community House’s zine about warding off ICE, called Form a Crowd, Stay Loud. Hilleren started gathering friends at a local bar called Nighthawk to fold the zines and pair them with whistles. Soon, the bar promoted the events via social media, and other Chicago bars began asking Hilleren to host folding parties for them. She’s hosted seven events around the city – most to capacity – and has helped people organize two others.View image in fullscreenZines created by the Pilsen Arts and Community House in Chicago.Photograph: Courtesy Emily Hilleren“People have seen the whistle kits and zines in person, recognize it’s a good, helpful thing and they see the opportunity to contribute to it,” she said. “The social aspect of it has been really attractive as well. Everyone I’ve talked to says: ‘I have to do something. I can’t just sit home, looking at my phone and reading all the bad news. I have to get out there, be with people, and do something tangible.’”Zines have always been inherently social and political, since they began as “fanzines” centered on science fiction in the 1930s, with the first known being The Comet. Fanzines shared opinions and views that were often expressed in letters to the editor that publications rejected.“Science fiction is a very political fiction, because it’s imagining different worlds and new worlds, and so the crossover to politics happens pretty early,” said New York University media and culture professor Stephen Duncombe, author of the book Notes from Underground: Zines and the Politics of Alternative Culture. “Zines started out as talking back to mass culture, and part of what people want to talk back to mass culture is about politics.”In the 1980s, during the punk rock movement, zines had their “second birth”, according to Duncombe, and it gave rise to the “perzine”, or personal zine of relayed experiences and opinions. Around this time, zines became more social – before social media – with review publications, like Fact Sheet Five by Mike Gunderloy, which catalogued hundreds of zines, becoming a place where people could learn about and request zines, discovering new ones in the communities with which they identified, such as queer, riot grrrl and Afropunk.View image in fullscreenA zine-folding event at the Nighthawk bar in Chicago, organized by Emily Hilleren.Photograph: Courtesy Jessica WolfeFor example, Duncombe recalled an old letter published in the queer zine Homocore from a gay teen boy who lived in Montana and loved hardcore music. “For that kid, this is pre-internet, and he lived in the world of country-and-western machismo straight guys,” Duncombe said. “This [zine] was like a world just opened up for him, and zines have always had that role for people.”According to the zine community, the medium has always sought to inform the public. Kaba recalled reading zines in the 1990s that spread then little-known information about the abortion medication mifepristone and herbal abortions.“All of a sudden, through zines, you learned how to self-manage your own abortion,” she said. “Every generation has the information that is relevant to their cultural space that they’re in, and zines are always going to speak to that, because those folks who are on the margins are looking for ways to connect.”View image in fullscreenA zine-folding event at the Nighthawk bar in Chicago, organized by Emily Hilleren.Photograph: Courtesy Emily HillerenAnd zines have long been a safe space for marginalized communities to express themselves. Nova Community Arts in Los Angeles hosts a weekly Queer Art Hang workshop, where LGBTQ+ folks can make, fold and trade zines together, in person, without surveillance or bullying on social media.“Being able to sit down in front of a piece of paper in a safe space, amongst friends and community members, is something that is honestly so healing for queer people, who have experienced, all of our lives, people telling us what we’re supposed to do, what things we’re supposed to put out there, and what we’re supposed to look like,” said Nova co-director Rosie Mayer.Though people often associate zines with gen X, younger generations – who have grown up with social media and cellphones – are turning to zines to inform and for solace amid the current political landscape. After ICE raids and protests erupted in Los Angeles earlier this year, 16-year-old Victoria Echerikuahperi hosted a healing zine workshop for raid victims and has continued to lead youth zine events around the city under her stage name, DJ Mariposa.“There’s no right or wrong way to do it, and people could get their creativity out,” she said. “A lot of people were thanking me and were happy, because, yes, writing about political things is heavy, but it’s also like a release, knowing that this zine could be helpful to someone, or this could open someone’s eyes.”"

They discuss the man behind the headlines – and why they are continuing his mission to help others struggling with addictionWed 10 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 08.41 ESTShareWatch the third season of Friends, writes Matthew Perry in his memoir, and you can see how thin he had become by the end of it. “Opioids fuck with your appetite, plus they make you vomit constantly,” he writes. Look again, and yes – his fragile wrists emerge from a shirt that looks as if he has borrowed it from someone far larger, his trousers hang off him – and it’s unbearably sad now, with the knowledge that addiction would kill Perry nearly 30 years later, at the age of 54. At the time, most people watching probably wouldn’t have noticed, dazzled instead by Perry’s sharpness and immaculate comic timing as Chandler Bing, the show’s dry wit. He was having to take 55 Vicodin pills a day – an opioid - just to function and avoid terrible withdrawal symptoms, but he was never high while he was working, he writes inFriends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing, which came out in 2022. He just had to make it to the end of the season so he could get help. Had the series lasted for more than its 25 episodes, he thought it would have killed him.That was the first time Perry went into rehab. He was 26, and one of the biggest stars in the world. There would be more than 65 attempts to detox from drug and alcohol addiction over the next decades until his death in 2023. Last week, adoctor was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prisonfor supplying ketamine in the lead-up to Perry’s death (though not the ketamine that killed him); three others who have pleaded guilty will be sentenced in the coming months.View image in fullscreenThe Friends cast in 1994, from left: Jennifer Aniston, David Schwimmer, Courteney Cox, Matt LeBlanc, Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyPerry’s manager, Doug Chapin, and publicist Lisa Kasteler-Calio had been working with Perry for more than 30 years. After he died, they launched theMatthew PerryFoundation, to support addiction treatment and recovery, and campaign to reduce stigma. Perry had long talked about the idea of an organisation doing both. By October 2023, Kasteler-Calio, one of Hollywood’s powerhouse publicists, had already decided to step away from the agency she had co-founded. She texted Perry – he was a big texter, she says – to see when he was free so she could go over and tell him in person. He immediately called her. “I was going to continue to work with him on [the foundation] and a few other ideas that he wanted me to be involved in,” she says, when we speak over Zoom, joined by Chapin.That was three days before he died. “The tragedy on top of the tragedy of losing Matthew is that he was ready to do the work,” she says. Chapin says: “Here we were, stopped mid-sentence, so there was nothing except, well, I guess we have to complete this. That was the driving force.” Kasteler-Calio points out that Perry had always said he didn’t want to be remembered forFriends, but as someone who had helped others. “We didn’t have to search for the mission. We had it. He wanted to help as many people as he could, it’s that simple,” she says.View image in fullscreenPerry in the first series of Friends, 1994.Photograph: NBC/NBCUniversal/Getty ImagesChapin became Perry’s manager in 1992, and introduced Perry to Kasteler-Calio just before it became clear that Friends – which launched in 1994 – would become huge. He was “adorable”, remembers Kasteler-Calio. “I think the reason people fell in love with Chandler is because the real Matthew came through.” Chapin remembers Perry as a young man who didn’t really change over all the decades they knew each other, when he was “what he always was – lovely, smart, funny.”Chapin is clear that while Perry craved fame, his struggles pre-dated the pressures it brought (Perry had his first drink at 14). “The pressures and the demons are not unusual for people who are very talented. I don’t want to make a mass determination, but it’s a particular kind of person that looks to have everybody know them and to be famous.” But fame and attention, he says, “amplify the pressure to some degree. More importantly, it made it very hard to have his problems happen in private.”It also killed Perry’s fantasy that if only he could become famous, he would feel better about himself. “He found himself with the number one TV show and the number one movie [The Whole Nine Yards], and, boom, his other struggles still existed,” he says. That wasn’t specific to Perry, he adds. “What was specific to Matthew is crazy loyalty,” says Chapin, adding that that is vanishingly rare in Hollywood. “There’s a reason we worked with him for 30 years. He kept his group of friends close. He kept his representatives close. He inspired loyalty, but he also gave loyalty, that was just one of his characteristics.”I don’t want people to think Matthew was a victim of the disease, because he was engaged in trying to recover – alwaysNeither had any idea that Perry was struggling at the beginning. “He was working so much, he was doing the show and doing a movie in the breaks, there was such intensity of work that I think it masked some of it,” says Chapin. He adds that also, Perry’s addiction “was not as much of a challenge [then] as it became for him.” Kasteler-Calio says: “Matthew felt a deep sense of responsibility to the other five [on Friends]. He showed up every day and he did the work. He wasn’t somebody who was out in the clubs and all of that.” He was drinking at home, and taking drugs. “Because this disease is so isolating, he was not publicly, like a lot of others, displaying his disease.”By the seventh season in 2000 – he had signed the deal in hospital, while being treated for pancreatitis caused by excessive alcohol – Perry’s castmates were sufficiently worried to take him aside and tell him they knew he had a problem. Chapin and Kasteler-Calio say that Perry was always very open with them. “There was never the situation like, ‘Oh, we know something’s happening, but we can’t talk to him about it,’” says Chapin. “He’d be the person, when it got bad, who would say, ‘I need to stop and get help.’ I don’t want [people] to have the picture that Matthew was, for lack of a better word, a victim of the disease, because he was engaged in trying to recover, always.”View image in fullscreenPerry’s manager Doug Chapin and his publicist Lisa Kasteler-Calio at the Matthew Perry Foundation.Photograph: Eric Charbonneau/The Matthew Perry FoundationBut it must have been difficult at times for them to do their jobs, and keep Perry’s career going for him. And there were times, admits Chapin, “where the disease collided with the work. I think it’s better that those stories come from [Perry’s] book than from us.” Neither want to dwell on episodes where productions were postponed because Perry wasn’t well – the 2002 film Serving Sara, or some of his scenes in Friends – or the times he did show up, such as on the CBS show The Odd Couple, but was unreliable. If Perry’s addiction did make their jobs tricky at times – and it must have done – there was no question that the priority was always his health. Kasteler-Calio, still protective, points out that when Perry did have to remove himself from work, on his return to sets he would go around “and apologise to each and every single person”. Many big name actors would not have done that, she adds.Although it became the story, Perry’s addiction is far from the whole picture. There were also stretches of sobriety, one of which brought him an Emmy nomination for his role on Friends, and there was the play he wrote and opened in London, the dark comedy The End of Longing, the TV shows he wrote such as the ABC sitcom Mr Sunshine, which he also starred in. “I miss the creative side of him,” says Chapin. “He was very smart, creatively, and that’s very energising to be around.” Kasteler-Calio misses the way he made her laugh. “There are just many things, as life happened, that Matthew was a part of. I remember all of that, because that’s where his kindness and the compassion came through.”When he was struggling, she says, he didn’t hide it. “He wasn’t a difficult person. I’ve had plenty of difficult clients. I didn’t have a difficult day with him.” He was not, adds Chapin, “a temperamental guy. He was a lovely, sweet person who had a personal struggle and was always fighting to be the creative, engaged person he loved being, and trying not to succumb to this other thing, this disease.”View image in fullscreenPerry with his publicist Lisa Kasteler-Calio in 2008.Photograph: WENN Rights Ltd/AlamyFor Kasteler-Calio, the bigger challenges came from dealing with a media intent on getting stories about Perry – his struggles were excessively documented – not from the actor himself. In her five-decade PR career, the celebrity clients “that were the most challenging when they got into crisis are the ones that didn’t want to listen, that thought they had all the answers. That was not Matthew.”There were a couple of pivotal positive moments in Perry’s experience of addiction and attempts to get better. One was the therapist who told him it wasn’t his fault, that it was a disease. “Coming to the understanding that he was battling with a chronic illness changed his whole mindset around it,” says Chapin. The other was the publication of his2022 memoir– funny, self-deprecating and brutal. “He was always, throughout even his worst times, very helpful and engaged with other people,” says Chapin. “They would come to him because he had so much experience with the disease [and treatment] that he knew a million avenues to suggest.”View image in fullscreenPerry in 2008, the year the play he wrote and starred in opened in London.Photograph: David M Benett/Getty ImagesThe book was a way to reach people on a massive scale. “It was the big removing of the Band-Aid of shame, for him,” says Chapin. “It was a very important step for him. We come back to the stigma and he was always very conscious that the guilt and the shame around [addiction] was part of the struggle. The book was his way of going, ‘Here I am, everything about me, good, bad and ugly.’ Presenting that out into the world and getting all the love back that he got for it was transformational for him.”They had always told him how loved he was, says Kasteler-Calio, but Perry would shrug it off. Now, she says, with audiences coming to hear him speak or the people who wrote to him of their own struggles, “it was right in front of him. You couldn’t deny the impact, and it was Matthew having the impact, not Chandler. As hard as the struggle was for him, conversely, being able to help people was equal to that. That’s why, once we lost him, there was no question that we needed to create this foundation and do this work.”Tackling stigma is one of its fundamental missions. Only 50% of Americans, says Kasteler-Calio, “recognise that [addiction is] a disease. The rest feel like it’s a moral failing, and that you should just get over it, and that’s not right.” This includes some of the medical profession, she says. “Doctors are not trained in how to treat this disease.” It should be required training for all, not just for specialists, so that any doctor can recognise it, signpost people to the correct treatment – and be careful with their prescribing.We’re doing what Matthew wanted. He said it over and over: I want to help as many people as possiblePerry writes that had he not taken the painkiller one doctor gave him on a film set early in his career, after he had injured himself in a jetski accident, perhaps “none of the next three decades would have gone the way they did”. Coming out of a two-week coma in 2018 – the result of a burst colon, followed by pneumonia, caused by the stresses his body had been through – he was put back on opioids. The foundation works with Dr Sarah Wakeman, an expert in addiction medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, and they have established a fellowship in Perry’s name to help train doctors. “One of the things that is important when we’re talking about this is that recovery is possible, this is a treatable disease,” says Chapin. “The more skilled we get at treating it, the more we’re going to see examples of recovery.”A summit held by the foundation in September brought about 200 experts together, along with people and communities with experience of addiction, to build partnerships and share knowledge about everything from treatment to policy. A week later, the foundation was speaking at the Clinton Global Initiative, run by Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton, about the impact of stigma, and how to end it. At the less high-profile end, one of the first things the foundation did was to give money to about 20 grassroots organisations they had identified across California which were helping people with addiction and desperately needed funding. Kasteler-Calio smiles when she said she spent two days on Zoom calls, offering the money and trying to convince people it wasn’t a scam. “What people have to go through to apply for grants, it’s expensive, it takes a lot of time. We wanted them to have access to the money immediately,” she says.View image in fullscreenMatthew Perry’s 2022 autobiography, Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing.Photograph: Hamdi Bendali/AlamyThere are employment initiatives to support people in recovery with getting back into work, and the foundation supports Bridge, a project led by doctors that aims to provide joined-up treatment for people with addiction who are leaving prison. “Because of our experience with Matthew, [we know that] it’s a multi-pronged disease, and you’ve got to hit it from a whole bunch of different directions at once,” says Chapin. “There is a medical aspect, the psychological aspect. There is also a community aspect to it. People don’t heal from this alone in a room. What we experienced throughout the Matthew experience was that there are all these holes in the process of recovery.” For many trying to recover, “You can get six weeks of sobriety in a shelter, and then there’s nothing, you’re on the street. There needs to be a wholeness, because the process needs to be sustained for a really long time. What we are looking at is where are the holes that we can fill?”Perry, say both, is present in all of this. “The six months of crying, that happened already,” says Chapin. “The rest has been working on his project, so he’s still right here with us, every day.” As for his ongoing grief, this is, he says, “the treatment”. Kasteler-Calio smiles and says, “We’re doing what Matthew wanted. He said it over and over: I want to help as many people as possible. Of course, we wish we were doing this with him. I miss him like crazy, but the best thing that we can do is just keep doing this work.”Explore more on these topicsMatthew PerryFriendsUS televisionAlcoholismTelevisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

It really cannot be overstated how much of a rehash this boyband contest isStuart HeritageWed 10 Dec 2025 03.01 ESTLast modified on Wed 10 Dec 2025 12.54 ESTShareLadies and gentlemen, the most cynical bait and switch of the year has finally arrived. To the casual viewer, Netflix’s new series Simon Cowell: The Next Act may appear to be yet another quasi-unvarnished authorised documentary series.And that would make sense, because those things are everywhere at the moment. Everyone fromDavid BeckhamtoRobbie WilliamstoCharlie Sheenhas made one, allowing a film crew into their lives to offer just enough grit to fool people into thinking they are watching anything other than a heavily sanitised publicity project. And, really, who deserves one of these more than Simon Cowell?Because here is a man who, as the face of The X Factor and Pop Idol, spent the first part of the 21st century at the top of the entertainment tree. He could make and break careers with a flick of his wrist. Discounting sport, royalty, Covid and (weirdly) Gavin & Stacey, the 2010 X Factor finale remains the most watched British TV show of the last 15 years. In his prime, Cowell was wealthy. He was powerful. He was everywhere.But then he disappeared. Much hyped projects – such as the “bigger than Disney” entertainment megabrand with Philip Green and the series of children’s books he announced five years ago – came to nothing. He broke his back. His appearance changed. There were whispers that he had become a devotee to a wealth of wacky-sounding health fads. Had he settled into semi-retirement? Was he a full-blown Howard Hughes-style hermit, growing out his fingernails? The world needed to know: what exactly does Cowell do with his life when there isn’t any X Factor to fill it?View image in fullscreenWill it make him famous again … Simon Cowell and Poo Bear in Simon Cowell: The Next Act.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixNow we know, for here comes the bait and switch. Even though it might be presented as a slice-of-life reality documentary, Simon Cowell: The Next Act is – wait for it – The X Factor. It’s literally just another bloody X Factor.No, really. One minute Cowell is semi-candidly bickering with his partner, Lauren Silverman, the next he’s junked that entire facade to find a new boyband. He holds auditions. He takes them to bootcamp. He uses pictures of their faces to decide who he wants to send home. There are unbelievably weak sob stories (one contestant, and please ready the hankies for this, works at a Nando’s). Short of Louis Walsh stumbling in to absent-mindedly take everything to deadlock, this is The X Factor. I cannot overstate this enough. It’s Cowell’s one idea, for the billionth time, in slightly different clothes.But, of course, Cowell wants to make a new boyband. His biggest success was creating One Direction, and he is openly envious of the rise of K-pop here, with their ultra-manufactured groups and rigidly controlled management. Which, admittedly, isn’t a particularly great thing to be envious of. The demands placed onK-pop acts are so great that abuse and suicide isn’t uncommon, as are “slave contracts” that forbid acts from gaining weight or falling in love.I’m prohibited from telling you how the series ends, but it might be best not to hold out much hope. Netflix’s last attempt at a singing competition – this summer’s Building the Band – was a dud. It was won by a group called 3Quency, whose first single failed to chart. And that show was specifically about a band, which is more than you can say about Simon Cowell: The Next Act. The star of this show is Cowell and Cowell alone. The group – all the identically haired 16-year-olds who did most of the work – are presented as an afterthought.The whole thing reminds me of Nathan Fielder’s brilliant comedy The Rehearsal, which did something similar this year. Fielder dragged a bunch of unknowing wannabes into a singing contest called Wings of Voice, only to reveal that it had been created specifically to help airline co-pilots be more confident during their inflight communication. That’s essentially what The Next Act is, although this time the secret goal is simply to make Cowell famous again. Those poor kids don’t stand a chance.Simon Cowell: The Next Act is on Netflix nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewSimon CowellreviewsShareReuse this content"

In fact, the advent of digital media marks the third information crisis humans have lived through: the first came after the invention of writing; the second followed the printing press.These were periods of great social conflict and upheaval, and they profoundly altered our social and political relationships as well as our understanding of the world around us. Writing ushered in the Axial Age, the period between the eighth and third centuries BC, when many of the world’s most influential religious figures and thinkers lived: Laozi, Buddha, Zoroaster, the Abrahamic prophets and the Greek philosophers. Gutenberg’s printing press helped bring about the Reformation. While it is too early to know where the internet era will take us, in her new book, which she describes as a “speculative historical project”, Alderman suggests that those earlier crises offer clues.She is already well known as the author ofThe Power, a feminist sci‑fi novel that won the 2017 Women’s prize for fiction, a games writer, and a science presenter for Radio 4. It is enjoyable to spend time with an author who reads widely, thinks deeply and possesses the intellectual confidence to take such a lofty, historical view of the messiness of our current political moment. Alderman gives us a lively introduction to work by theorists such as Walter Ong, who studied how literacy changes culture, and Elizabeth Eisenstein, who explored how the printing press transformed our relationship to the truth. Ong observed that oral cultures were more conservative and less exploratory than literate ones because learned people had to spend so much time memorising information. Writing made possible more complex, reflective thought.It’s all too easy to forget that the person you’re arguing with is real and has feelingsSimilarly, the internet is changing us in profound ways. It makes it easier to think as a group, it has vastly increased the amount of information we each encounter and altered who can publish and broadcast it. It leads to “disintermediation”, because people can do for themselves things they once relied on specialists for – book flights, research vaccines. It has undermined the print-era institutions that once acted as gatekeepers to the truth. Eventually, Alderman writes, we’ll develop new institutions that will help us manage the firehose of information we’re now exposed to. For the time being, she argues, we would do well to shore up some old ones: broadcasters such as the BBC and public libraries.Alderman has a keen eye for the many subtle ways that digital media is changing us psychologically, and she is wise to note the fact that these shifts are often double-edged. The anonymity and vastness of the internet mean more people are sharing their inner thoughts and feelings online, which in turn means more people are learning that the weird quirk they thought was totally unique to them – the pleasurable tingle of ASMR, say – is something they have in common with others. It has never been easier to understand that “there isn’t a kind of person who isn’t a person”, Alderman writes and yet, online, it’s all too easy to forget that the person you’re arguing with is real and has feelings.With each new technology things get faster, she observes: printing a book is faster than copying one by hand; posting something online is quicker than printing it. Internet culture is evolving at an astonishing pace, and Alderman doesn’t even go into the disruptions of AI. We can’t possibly know how all of this will unfold, but it’s hard not to feel swept up by the sense of hope that underlies her speculations about our collective future. “We made a wonderful, catastrophic thing with writing. With printing. With the internet … We are making our minds do something they never evolved to do,” she writes. “It’s hard, and painful, and often makes us angry and afraid. And yet … every time we end by seeing each other more clearly.”Don’t Burn Anyone at the Stake Today (And Other Lessons from History About Living Through an Information Crisis) by Naomi Alderman is published by Fig Tree (£16.99).

Frances is a rich and beautiful twentysomething who becomes a “reluctant celebrity in certain circles” after her film, “an experimental documentary about rural isolation and rightwing conspiracy theories” in the modern-day United States, premieres to critical acclaim at a gallery in New York. Avery, meanwhile, is struggling to write what she describes as “a book of cultural reports”.Frances’s success isn’t easy for Avery. The two women met as undergraduates, but Avery hasn’t got family money. She maxes out her credit card and does occasional escort work to meet tuition payments. What makes her most resentful, though, is that Frances has dropped out of grad school to get married. Back in New York, panicked about her prospects, Avery goes out with a string of men – none significant enough to be referred to by their actual names – and ends up taking a job at a rightwing dating app called Patriarchy.While this is Levy’s first book, she has made a name for herself – in certain circles – as a founding editor of Forever Magazine, a trendy publication for alternative literature and arts. “A big thing,” Levy has said when describing its editorial preferences, “is style over plot. We really care about language.” This approach is reflected in Flat Earth – and some passages from the book are edited versions of stories that Levy wrote for the magazine. The prose is, for the most part, simple and precise, punctuated with bursts of imagery (“I fluttered around the windowless room like a pigeon in an airport”) as well as short extracts from what appear to be Avery’s cultural reports, which read almost like poems – strange visions of an apocalyptic present or near future.Avery is, of course, miserable – cynical participation in a rigged system can only get you so farIt’s true, too, that there is not much in the way of narrative here. Levy sneaks in a joke about this, with Avery admitting that “when I did manage to write there was no plot, just prose. I told myself this was because I was a socialist or something, uninterested in the commercial potential of books.” There’s a wedding, a funeral, gallery openings and other events – but really these are occasions for Levy to describe the world that her characters move in.The book is itself, in a sense, a cultural report. Sometimes it gets a little too hyperspecific, as in the satirical depictions of New York’s downtown arts scene. But the bigger picture – late-stage capitalism segueing into techno-feudalism, eco-pessimism, a moral arc of the universe that seems to bend not towards justice but away from it – is bleakly relevant to all of us.Perhaps the most vivid aspect is how thoroughly Avery has absorbed the worst values of the contemporary moment, especially in the way she sees herself and Frances as competing objects of sexual commerce. She has no time for feminism, which she notes is no longer fashionable. “It comes as a relief when our romantic relationships reconfigure around regressive ideas about gender,” she writes in one of her reports. She takes tips from an online life coach on how to behave as femininely as possible so that men will want to look after her. She is terrified of ageing. At one stage, she wears a cow-print outfit to a party “to signal fertility”.It would be funny if it weren’t so sad. Avery is, of course, miserable – cynical participation in a rigged system can only get you so far. Flat Earth is not, unsurprisingly, a joyful book. But somewhere in all the irony we might find a glimmer of hope: the hint from Levy that there might be other ways to see the world, which our narrator has not discovered. A therapist, for instance, suggests that she work to “cultivate an inner life”. Avery may feel as though her youth is already dwindling, but she’s only in her 20s. There’s still time for her to grow up.Flat Earth by Anika Jade Levy is published by Abacus (£14.99). To support the Guardian order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

The star is theEnglish stage actor Eille Norwood, whose handsome, troubled, sensitive face looms out of the screen in extreme closeup in the first of these, A Scandal in Bohemia, from 1921. Dr Watson is played in all of the films by Hubert Willis.In this first film, our hero demonstrates his talents as a master of disguise; Holmes is approached by the King of Bohemia at his rooms in Baker Street, wearing a mask (so concerned is he about being recognised), although Holmes’s powers of deduction (and of course his own superior mastery of this kind of imposture) allow him to rumble the king at once. He wants Holmes to purloin an incriminating photograph taken of him with a young woman – an “adventuress” is how he quaintly puts it – which could be embarrassing. This is the fashionable stage actor Irene Adler, played by Joan Beverley, and Holmes manages to get on stage with Adler mid-performance to carry out a daring stratagem. But very startlingly, Adler appears to be the one person who can outwit Holmes.In The Golden Pince-Nez from 1922, a dead man is found with this object in his grasp, and Holmes brilliantly intuits exactly what sort of person would have worn these spectacles. And in The Final Problem from 1923, Holmes climactically confronts the Napoleon of crime, Moriarty himself (played by Percy Standing), for their colossal hand-to-hand combat, transplanted from the Reichenbach Falls in the original to Cheddar Gorge.What is startling, especially in the first of these, is the use of real London locations – the city that Conan Doyle would have recognised. These movies were shot with the knowledge and approval of Conan Doyle, who was a big fan of Norwood’s performance, and it might have influenced his composition of the later stories, the way Sean Connery was said to have influenced Ian Fleming’s conception of James Bond in the last years of Fleming’s life.Silent Sherlock: Three Classic Cases is in UK and Irish cinemas from 12 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmCrime filmsFilm adaptationsArthur Conan DoyleSilent filmreviewsShareReuse this content"

Broadly appealing, well cast, neither strictly comic nor melodramatic, concerning ordinary people in non-IP circumstances, it’s the type of mid-budget adult film that used to appear regularly in cinemas in the 90s and aughts, before the streaming wars devoured the market. Even its lead promotional image, turned into a life-size cardboard cut-out at the theater – Emma Mackey’s titular Ella in a sensible trench coat, balancing on one foot as she fixes a broken block heel – recalls a bygone era of films like Confessions of a Shopaholic, Miss Congeniality or Little Miss Sunshine, that would now go straight to streaming.Merv review – a dog steals the show in Amazon’s by-the-book Christmas romcomRead moreTo be clear, I miss these types of movies, and want to see more of them. I want to see a lighthearted but realistic portrait of a 34-year-old woman serving as lieutenant governor of an unnamed state that is, judging by the college football paraphernalia and the vibe, probably Michigan. I want to still believe in the possibility of smart and sentimental popcorn fare whose low-stakes drama insists on the inherent inconsistencies and decency of people. I especially would like to say that Ella McCay is an admirable final salvo (or so) for Brooks, the 85-year-old writer/director/producer whose prolific career includes both iconic sitcoms (The Mary Tyler Moore show, Taxi and the Simpsons), and now-classic films (Terms of Endearment, Broadcast News and As Good As It Gets).Unfortunately, I cannot say any of that, as Ella McCay is, first and foremost, a mess – a clunky collection of incoherent characters and confounding plot that seem to defy basic story logic at every turn, and not in a surprising or intriguing way. It’s never a good sign when the lead character reads the literal definition for trauma, finger tracing the dictionary, in the first five minutes of a movie.As told by Estelle (Julie Kavner), Ella’s secretary and the film’s narrator, this is supposedly the story of the remarkable Ella McCay, a highly intelligent and moral woman who overcame the shame of a philandering father (Woody Harrelson) and the trauma (yes) of her mother’s untimely death (she’s played, too briefly, by Rebecca Hall), to become one of the youngest political fixtures of her home state. But that narrative spine frays quickly into strangely disconnected tangents that precede at a jarring rhythm, as the film insists on tying each scene into a sweet bow no matter how incongruous to the conversation preceding it. It would be transfixing, to watch a film so oddly and awkwardly constructed, if it weren’t also so disappointing.The would-be mosaic of characters in the Ella-verse include her beloved Aunt Helen, played byJamie Lee Curtisin what feels like a pantomime of a hammy Jamie Lee Curtis character; her prodigal father, returned to make amends for selfish reasons; her husband Ryan (Jack Lowden), a local restaurateur who is supportive of Ella’s career until, suddenly and without reason, he isn’t (I have to assume there were 45 sense-making minutes cut from this nearly two-hour film); and her younger brother Casey (Spike Fearn), an agoraphobic quant reeling from a breakup with Ayo Edebiri’s Susan, a classic awkward Edebiri character who in any other movie would be cut for time. Also, there’s Kumail Nanjiani as the friendly state trooper whose name may as well be Quippy Side Character, and Albert Brooks as Governor Bill, dispensing such clanging political wisdom as “you have to make dumb people feel less dumb”.Eventually, it becomes apparent that the film concerns McCay’s days-long stint as governor in 2008, a time conveniently without Twitter or Trump, after Governor Bill leaves for the Obama administration. How did this highly ambitious, undeniably beautiful policy wonk become the Lady Jane Grey of presumably Michigan, briefly lifted from obscurity and felled by forces largely outside her control? Ella McCay doesn’t seem that interested in telling you, instead stumbling about the story as if rummaging through a teenager’s unkempt room, pulling and replacing random objects on the pile.It would be impossible for most actors to rise above such disarray, or to play both 34 and 16 (in flashbacks). Though Mackey ably tries – my eyes lit up when she blisters through a cannabis-inflected rant, providing a too-brief window into the frantic inner monologue of a woman with a lot of liberal policy ideas – she can’t sell a heroine whose defining character traits are wonkish-ness and reactivity. Which is a shame, as there’s clearly something here, buried beneath the polished, inauthentic sheen of the movie politician. I saw a brief flash of it, late in the film, as Ella faces a choice between her morals and her marriage – a flicker of tough, contradictory and ineffable feelings, a hint of a better, thornier, lived-in movie. A second where she, too, wishes it were different.Ella McCay is out in cinemas on 12 DecemberExplore more on these topicsJames L BrooksJamie Lee CurtisWoody HarrelsonJack LowdenComedy filmsRebecca HallComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Patterson and Jez Bond. Why else, if not to justify a pun, would you make an a capella singing version of the Victorian vampire novel? And Dracapella is nothing if not fond of a pun. (“There is a supernatural force at work in Transylvania.” / “Which is?” / “No, not witches.”) There’s lots more where that came from in this spooky comedy romp, in which an undead Romanian count concludes his 400-year search for love to a soundtrack of closely harmonised 80s power ballads and champion beatboxing.The latter is all provided by ABH Beatbox, a cast member of theBAC Beatbox Academy’s Frankenstein, in whose globetrotting success I discern another (distant) inspiration for this music-gothic crossover. This one’s a more traditional affair, a knowing entertainment forever sending up its own storytelling cliches, and at every turn choosing groansome laughs over thrills. Arguably it lowers the stakes (it’s catching!) when a story about centuries-spanning passion becomes a vehicle for The Play What I Wrote-style larks. But the relentless silliness of Patterson and Bond’s confection amply compensates, as Harker’s train to Dover is decanted on to a rail replacement bus, and Dracula demonstrates his metaphysical powers by having his henchman consume – as if by magic! – a bowlful of marshmallows.View image in fullscreenVocal punch … Keala Settle, right, with Philip Pope in Dracapella.Photograph: Craig SugdenInfrequently, the comedy feels effortful, and at the expense of forward thrust. There are songs, too – Gnarls Barkley’s Crazy as sung by Harker’s deranged predecessor, say – that feel more like sidesteps than narrative strides forward. But more often, the spirited cast (includingcomedian Ciarán Dowdand comedy all-rounder Philip Pope), restless wordplay (“Never die? I could live with that”) and meta-theatrical smarts are a joy, and the songs (Cyndi Lauper, Bonnie Tyler, Survivor) sumptuously arranged and winningly incongruous. Props in particular toKeala Settle, packing vocal punch as she serenades Dracula with the soul number At Last. And to ABH Beatbox, whose Looney Tunes effects create a vivid interactive sound world for all this ghoulish good fun.AtPark theatre, London, until 17 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsStageComedy (Stage)TheatreChristmas showsHorror booksFictionComedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

Firstly, an animal is played on stage, a tiger shot in a Baghdad zoo that returns from the dead to haunt the US marine who pulled the trigger. Secondly, it talks. Wisecracks, in fact, and interrogates the existence of God. A twisted version ofLife of Pi? Certainly it’s less of a dream than a nightmare in which anything could happen.View image in fullscreenThe dead haunt the living … Sayyid Aki as Uday Hussein.Photograph: Ellie KurttzAnd things do lurch from one thing to another with illogical effect. To add to the frisson of unpredictability, Kathryn Hunter performs as the tiger afterDavid Threlfallbowed out, until further notice, due to illness. The part was played on Broadway in 2011 by Robin Williams but Hunter brings her own comic swagger.Director Omar Elerian has shown himself adept at handling absurdist black comedies includingThe Chairs(also starring Hunter) and this is an inspired match. She makes for a reluctantly rock’n’roll tiger, droll in spirit and looking like a female version of Keith Richards with bandana and electric guitar at one point.This is primarily a play about men’s experience of war, following two marines, Kev (Arinzé Kene) and Tom (Patrick Gibson), a Dumb and Dumber double-act with sharper edges, along with their Iraqi interpreter, Musa (Ammar Haj Ahmad), who used to be a gardener to Saddam Hussein’s sons, Uday and Qusay. The few women here are relegated to bit parts: leper, sex worker, abused sister, all reduced to types (is this what war does?). Apart from the tiger, that is, whom Hunter emphatically calls “she”.A wholly unconventional play in which the dead haunt the living, often comically, it seeks to do many things at once. It is theatrical but stilted, ambling in structure as characters wander from a literal landscape of urban collapse into a more symbolic realm of a burnt out Eden.‘It went gangbusters’: the play about the Iraq war – told through the eyes of a starving Baghdad zoo tigerRead moreThe pace is baggy and the tragedy is diffuse, its drama undercut by cerebral questioning. The production’s most enraged moments are downplayed when it could go for the jugular. But the high-wire mix of comedy, horror and intellectualism is brave, the imagination and profundity a breath of fresh air in a theatrical landscape that cleaves to easy entertainment and distraction from darkness. Joseph stares into the Nietzschean abyss, sniggering, and it sniggers back.Rajha Shakiry’s set is a burning city that turns biblical, characters lost in the wilderness of a strange, liminal afterlife, trapped by grief or guilt, especially Musa, who feels perpetual regret for unwittingly putting his sister into the predatory hands of Uday (Sayyid Aki). The latter is his tormentor, coming back with Qusay’s (whispering!) head in a bag, and becomes a deliciously dark comic highlight.As a play, it repeats itself and does not know how to end.

It had its premiere in 1735 at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, where the RoyalOperaHouse now stands. Then it was positively demanded that composers and librettists magic up a happy ending from even the most tragic story, sending audiences away uplifted, and Handel duly delivered. However, audiences for the Royal Opera’s new production – surprisingly, its first since that premiere, unless you count a streamed concert during lockdown – might come away with more contradictory feelings.The directorJetske Mijnssen, making her Covent Garden debut, is not convinced by that forced happy ending – which, after her staging of Wagner’sParsifal at Glyndebournethis summer, won’t come as a big surprise. Like the latter piece, here again is a dysfunctional royal family. We’re in the modern palace of a besuited, ailing king; the five children playing at weddings around the dining table during the overture reappear as adults, becoming his two daughters and their three suitors.Spoilt princess Ginevra, who throws designer dresses (courtesy of costume designer Uta Meenen) around for her sister Dalinda to pick up, initially seems to deserve brattish Polinesso rather than playful, earnest Ariodante. But they all have some growing up to do. By the end, when Ariodante is singing his joyful final aria while comforting his traumatised brother, it feels as though Mijnssen is making a dramatic point at the music’s expense, stretching the disjunct between drama and music just too far.View image in fullscreenNo weak link … (from left): Elena Villalón, Emily D’Angelo and Christophe Dumaux in Ariodante.Photograph: Marc BrennerMijnssen’s detailed work shows, and there’s a level of intensity that’s maintained by everyone, right down to the silent uniformed staff enduring the young royals’ thoughtlessness.The cast has no weak link. The countertenor Christophe Dumaux, the only singer to remain from this production’s first run at the Opéra National du Rhin last year, is the jovial yet predatory Polinesso, with Ed Lyon as Ariodante’s nerdy brother Luciano and Elena Villalón as Dalinda. Peter Kellner, his bass exuding gravitas and vulnerability, plays the king.The mezzo-soprano Emily D’Angelo as Ariodante and soprano Jacquelyn Stucker as Ginevra have the long, lonely scenes of introspection that are the opera’s centres of gravity and both have the gleaming tone, technique and magnetism to carry them. Yet neither projects much text: it almost feels as though this is instrumental music.The disjointed feeling is reinforced in the raised pit, where Stefano Montanari conducts the Royal Opera House orchestra, sometimes from the violin. With chamber organ and theorbo standing out starkly, and with Montanari weaving his own embellishments on top of the orchestral violins, it’s inventive and dynamic but often self-consciously so, and doesn’t always let the singers breathe.AtRoyal Opera Houseuntil 21 December.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

As a student, long nights would end, not infrequently, with a swim at sunrise (until, one morning, the police arrived to remind us that sharks feed at dawn). So it’s hardly surprising that, after moving to Norwich to study in my 20s, the British seaside trips I made felt tepid. Cromer, with its swathe of beige sand sloping into water an almost identical colour, seemed to suggest that over here, land and sea were really not that different from one another. That the sea as I’d known it – with all its ecstatic, annihilating energy – was an unruly part of the Earth whose existence was best disavowed.A map showing Portscatho in CornwallIt was only several years later, burnt out from a soul-destroying job, that I took a week off and boarded a train to Cornwall. I was 25, poor and suffering from the kind of gastric complaints that often accompany misery. With a pair of shorts, two T-shirts and a raincoat in my backpack, I arrived in St Ives and set off to walk the Cornish coastal path.On my second day, to my surprise, I was joined by an Iranian philosophy student I’d met at my local cafe – perhaps he was lonely and ill at ease too – and we skirted the cliffs in single file talking Hegel and subsisting almost entirely on the blackberries which burst from the verges demanding to be eaten. Beneath us, the sea shifted between being darkly rageful and a blue so pure that, if you squinted, could be the Mediterranean. By day three, we were sleeping together, and by day five, having suddenly become allergic to each other, I carried on alone.I didn’t discover Portscatho on that trip, but I did discover the pleasures of tracing the Cornish coastline on foot. Which is how, a decade later, coming round the headland of the Roseland peninsula while hulkingly pregnant, I laid eyes – in the next bay – on a group of oddly gentle-looking Georgian houses surrounding a small harbour.View image in fullscreen‘Georgian houses surround the small harbour.’Photograph: PA Images/AlamyThe feeling I had, coming into that village, reminds me of a passage in a Nabokov story,Cloud, Castle, Lake. A bachelor, who’s been forced to go on a communal holiday by the “Bureau of Pleasantrips”, unexpectedly comes upon a configuration of elements – a dark castle overlooking a lake on which a cloud is reflected in its entirety – whose particular arrangement simultaneously reveals and fulfils a longing so deeply buried in himself that, until then, he hadn’t known it existed.I love being in Portscatho when the clocks change … I’m often still on the beach at 5pm when the clear night sky brings out its waresIt was late autumn. As the narrow path dropped from the cliffs, the landscape became almost tropical: dry grasses turned into passionflowers. Crepey pink rhododendrons peered from the front gardens of the houses on the outskirts of the village. I remember the clouds that had brooded over the landscape for days suddenly clearing, giving way not to a half-hearted sunshine, but to the kind that makes you want to strip off your clothes and inhibitions and become your true self. In the village square, above a pier, off which a group of children were throwing themselves into the sea, was a pub that spilled on to the pavement, where a group of men sang sea shanties watched by people leaning against the low walls of houses over the road, sipping pints.Writers, in my experience, prefer disillusionment to transcendence. I, for one, suspected – even as it occurred – that my Cloud, Castle, Lake experience would, on repeat visits, turn out to be false: the product of novelty or pregnancy hormones. And yet, in the decade since – and not a year has passed when I’ve not gone back to Portscatho at least once – it hasn’t lost its sheen.View image in fullscreenKatharine Kilalea on the beach with her children.Photograph: Karni ArieliWhat does one picturesque seaside village, with its two pubs and its fish and chip shop, its Harbour Club hosting cover bands on Saturday nights, give that another does not? Sometimes, my love for it seems embarrassing. An indictment on my heart. As though, if I were less naive, less needing of tenderness or comfort, I’d give myself over to wilder, more difficult beaches – like Towan Beach, a mile or so further along the coast, whose crescent of empty sand resembles the beaches in New Yorker cartoons where a bearded man washes up to spend eternity eating coconuts.I love New Year, when local celebrity chef Simon Stallard cooks up a meal on the slipway and everyone gathers for the annual fireworksI should be able to enjoy a wild sea surrounded by nothing but wilderness, rather than a sea, like Portscatho’s, in which one is always a few steps from humanity and the comforts of the low-ceilingedPlume of Feathers, or a chowder cooked by local celebrity chef Simon Stallard (whose latest venture,the Standard Inn,is up the road in Gerrans). Or a grocery shop selling artisanal cheeses and New World wines. Or a gallery with paintings in the style ofGeorges Braque, instead of the bits of driftwood bric-a-brac and watercolour paintings of boats that wash up in most coastal towns. I ought to join the local wild swimming group for its daily 8am dip without needing the comforts of an espresso from a beachfront coffee bar to warm me afterwards. But, just as ghost stories are best enjoyed from a cosy chair by the fire …View image in fullscreenThe author takes a cold water dip.Photograph: Karni ArieliWhat redeems me, in my own eyes, is my preference for the winter months over the summer ones. I love being in Portscatho when the clocks change, and we’re meant to stay indoors watching whatever’s done well at the Emmys, but are often still on the beach at 5pm when the clear night sky brings out its wares. I love New Year, too, when Stallard cooks up a meal on the slipway – one year it was paella – and everyone gathers for the annual firework display.I love, best of all, the moment when, turning down the steep road into the village at the end of the long drive from London, I see the Plume, and the two roads extending from either side of it like outstretched arms towards the bay. How the sea, every time I arrive, seems to say: “Here you are, at the edge of the world, you’ve arrived at the end of the place where you’ve carried out your labours, so you can finally relax.”Katharine Kilalea is the author of OK, Mr Field, published by Faber at £8.99.To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Sticky, sweet and complex, these boozy treats are wonderful spooned over rice pudding, porridge, yoghurt, ice-cream or even panna cotta.Don’t waste a fresh tea bag, though – enjoy a cuppa first, then use the spent one to infuse the prunes overnight. Earl grey adds fragrant, citrus notes, builders’ tea gives a malty depth, lapsang souchong brings smokiness, and chamomile or rooibos offer softer, floral tones. It’s also worth experimenting with other dried fruits beyond prunes: apricots, figs and/or dates all work beautifully, too.Tea-soaked prunes (or dried fruit)I like to give a jar of preserves as a gift whenever I’m invited somewhere for dinner, and this recipe turns a handful of dried fruit and a spent teabag into something that feels like a real treat. It’s the perfect way to stretch the lifespan of ingredients that might otherwise be forgotten: dried fruit at the back of the cupboard, a heel of citrus, even a used teabag. The tannins in tea balance the sweetness of the fruit beautifully, while a splash of whisky, brandy or rum lends a gentle warmth.50g dark brown sugar1 piece citrus peel(optional)1 used teabag200-250g dried prunes, or apricots, figs and/or dates1 cap whisky, or brandy (optional)Put the sugar (I use dark brown for richness), an optional piece of citrus peel and a used teabag in a clean 500ml jar. Pour in about 350ml just-boiled water and leave to infuse for about 10 minutes, until the water is warm but not hot. Add 200-250g dried prunes), cover, seal and leave to infuse overnight. I like a strong brew, so I leave the bag in until the next morning, so take it out earlier if you prefer a subtler flavour.The next day, strain the syrup from the jar into a small pan, bring to a boil and reduce by about two-thirds, until thick and glossy. Pour the syrup back over the soaked fruit and, if you like, add a splash of whisky or brandy. Seal the jar, give it a little shake and put in the fridge, where the prunes will now keep for at least a month, ready for spooning over desserts or gifting to a friend.Explore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkWaste notFoodFood wasteFruitTeaDessertChristmasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For spice lovers, this moreish Mexican brittle, which is inspired by salsa macha (a delicious chilli-crunch), is sweet, salty, smoky, crunchy and has hints of anise. Then, for savoury lovers, some cheesy pinwheel cookies enlivened with XO sauce. XO is a deeply umami condiment from Hong Kong made from dried seafood, salty ham, chilli and spices. Paired with tangy manchego, it adds a funky kick to these crumbly biscuits.Mexican pumpkin seed and salted spice brittlePrep5 minCook25 min, plus coolingServes6-8100g pumpkin seeds125g salted peanuts2tbsp coriander seeds2tbsp fennel seeds2tsp caraway seeds1tsp dried oregano2tbsp sesame seeds2tsp ancho chilli powder or smoked paprika2tsp smoked salt, crushed to powder70g butter300g caster sugarIn a large, dry frying pan or skillet, toast the pumpkin seeds, stirring the whole time, for two to three minutes, until they start to pop and tint brown. Tip into a large bowl and leave to cool completely. Repeat with the peanuts, until they just tint brown, then tip into the bowl.In the same pan, dry toast the coriander seeds, fennel seeds, caraway seeds and dried oregano for a minute or two, until they take on just a little colour and release their aromas; take care not to burn them. Pour into the nut bowl.Finally, dry toast the sesame seeds for 30-45 seconds, until they just tint brown, then tip into the bowl. Add the chilli powder and smoked salt, mix well and set aside.Have ready a large rectangle of nonstick baking paper or a large silicon baking mat. Heat the butter in a large pan until fully melted, then add the caster sugar and 50ml cold water. Swirl the pan gently over a medium-high heat (do not over-stir, because the mix can easily crystallise) for five or six minutes, until the mix turns a deep caramel colour and reaches 155C on a sugar thermometer – this is important, because it’s the hard crack point for the sugar.Quickly pour in the nuts, seeds and spices, mix thoroughly, then pour evenly on to the baking paper – take care, because it will be hot. Put a sheet of greaseproof paper on top of the mix and use a rolling pin to flatten it out into an even layer about ¾cm thick. Peel off the top sheet of paper, leave to cool completely, then snap into shards and enjoy. They’ll keep for a month in an airtight container.Manchego and XO-poppyseed pinwheelsView image in fullscreenCheesy whatsits: Gurdeep Loyal’s manchego and XO-poppyseed pinwheels.Prep15 minChill45 minCook50 minMakes25-303tbsp XO sauce(I use Lee Kum Kee) – if you can’t find any, mix 3 tbsp Chinese chilli crisp with ¾ tsp shrimp paste50g black poppy seeds2tbsp white-wine vinegarSugar350g plain flour,plus extra for dusting½tsp baking powder1½tsp black pepper, coarsely crushed1½tsp English mustard powder2tbsp coarse semolinaFine salt200g butter, cold and cubed150g manchego, finely grated50g parmesan, finely grated2 large egg yolks, whiskedIn a small blender, whizz the XO sauce, black poppy seeds, white-wine vinegar and a pinch of sugar for one to two minutes, scraping down the sides halfway, until you have a consistent coarse paste. Add a splash of water to loosen, if need be, then scrape into a bowl, cover and chill.Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, black pepper, mustard powder, semolina and a half-teaspoon of fine salt. Using your fingers, rub in the butter cubes until the mix resembles even, small, damp breadcrumbs with no lumps. Mix in the cheeses.Add the eggs yolks, then use your hands just to bring everything together into a dough, adding two teaspoons of ice-cold water. (Don’t over-knead; add an extra one or two teaspoons of water, if needed.) Press into a very tight ball with no cracks, then shape into a flattened square about 20cm x 20cm x 2½cm. Wrap in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for 15 minutes.Put the dough on a floured surface, cut it in half vertically, then put one half on top of the other. Roll into a large rectangle about 40cm x 30cm x ½cm, pressing together any cracks.Use a spatula to spread the XO-poppy seed filling in an even layer over the dough. Carefully and tightly roll from the top to the bottom, a bit like a Swiss roll (don’t worry if it cracks). Slice the log into 1cm-thick cookies, then arrange on two oven sheets lined with baking paper. Rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Bake the cookies for 16-18 minutes, rotating the trays once halfway, until golden brown. If you like, sprinkle with an extra grating of manchego three minutes before the cooking time is up. Remove, leave to cool completely on a rack, then store. The cookies will keep for a week in an airtight container.Flavour Heroes: 15 Modern Pantry Ingredients to Amplify Your Cooking, by Gurdeep Loyal, is published by Quadrille at £27.
