Some trials have had shipping costs alone increase to 10 times since Brexit.The extra rules and costs have had a “significant negative impact” on UK cancer research, creating “new barriers” that are “holding back life-saving research” for Britons, the report says.In some cases, the impact has been devastating. Children are among the NHS cancer patients whose tumours have returned or treatment has stopped working, leaving them in limbo and denied drugs that could extend or save their lives, senior doctors told the Guardian.Sources said officials in the Cabinet Office and the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology were studying the findings of the review.It cites evidence from a range of leading clinicians, scientists and researchers, and was compiled by experts from organisations includingCancerResearch UK, the University of Southampton, and Hatch, a research consultancy.In a statement, the government said clinical trials were vital to millions of Britons with long-term conditions for whom limited treatments were available in routine care, including cancer patients for whom routine therapies were ineffective.Ministers were committed to “strengthening” the UK’s relationship with the EU on research, and the government offered “extensive support” for UK researchers to help them secure funding, a spokesperson added.Three areas of UK cancer research have been hit particularly hard by its departure from the EU, according to the report. They are the regulatory environment for clinical trials, the mobility of the cancer research workforce and access to research funding and collaboration.Clinical trial groups and universities are struggling to attract “global talent” in cancer research to come to Britain, with UK patients missing out on the expertise of the world’s top cancer scientists.At the same time, UK researchers are finding it “more difficult” to attract grant funding to explore new ways to save the lives of patients “due to additional bureaucracy since the UK left the EU”.The report also reveals the UK is needlessly duplicating drug testing in clinical trials involving the UK and EU, with extra checks causing potentially deadly delays.In one case, the UK had to spend an extra £22,000 for an official to certify batches of aspirin for use in a cancer trial. Aspirin is one of the world’s most familiar drugs and the batches had already been checked in the EU.Meanwhile, Brexit is having a wider, damaging effect on life-saving research in the EU, the report adds. “The exclusion of UK researchers from European cancer research activities has had, and will continue to have, negative consequences for the overall European cancer research effort,” it says.Leading experts shown the report by the Guardian said the harm Brexit had inflicted on UK cancer research and NHS patients had been inevitable and predicted to occur.“Those of us who understood the EU warned repeatedly about precisely these concerns,” said Dr Martin McKee, a professor of European PublicHealthat the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. “These findings are not just predictable, they were predicted.”He added: “It was always inevitable that Brexit would lead to costly duplication and barriers to collaboration.”Mark Dayan, the Brexit programme lead at the Nuffield Trust, a health thinktank, said the report highlighted “concrete examples” of “disruptions which many warned were inevitable from the moment that we left the EU with a relatively hard Brexit for health and research”.The UK and EU are due to renew the trade and cooperation agreement this year, and discuss a wider reset which will shape the future UK-EU relationship.Keir Starmer should make the case for “a new pact to protect health”, Dayan said, “cutting back pointless post-Brexit red tape on medicines testing and research approvals by being willing to cooperate and offer guarantees”.The report recommends the creation of a mutual recognition agreement for testing medicines, to cut costs for researchers leading cross-border trials. Without it, patients will experience further delays to trials in future, denying them access to potentially life-saving treatments, it says.A government spokesperson said: “We are strengthening our relationship with the EU on research and have been providing extensive support for researchers to help them secure funding from the £80bn Horizon Europe programme and get more vital treatments from the lab to patients.”Last year, theGuardian revealedhow hundreds of thousands of people in the UK were being forced to wait months to begin even basic cancer treatment, such as surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, with deadly delays “routine” and even children denied timely care.Explore more on these topicsCancer researchBrexitMedical researchCancerNHSDrugsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Phil Hegseth, the secretary’s younger brother, was hired as a senior Pentagon adviser and is the defense department’s liaison to the Department of Homeland Security. It is unclear why either would need to know about the details of strikes plans in advance.According to the Times, Hegseth used his private phone, rather than a government device, to access the Signal chat with his family and friends.CNNreported later on Sundaythat three sources familiar with Hegseth’s private Signal group confirmed to the broadcaster that he had used it to share Yemen attack plans before the strikes were launched.A person familiar with the contents and those who received the messages, confirmed the second chat to the Associated Press ands said that it included 13 people.Shortly after the news of the second Signal chat broke, Politico published an opinion article by Hegseth’s former press secretary, John Ullyot,who wrote: “It’s been a month of total chaos at the Pentagon. From leaks of sensitive operational plans to mass firings, the dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president – who deserves better from his senior leadership”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationPete HegsethSignal group chat leakUS politicsUS militaryUS national securitynewsShareReuse this content"

The Russian army is attempting to create the general impression of a ceasefire, while in some areas still continuing isolated attempts to advance.”Zelenskyy later said Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in an ambush in Toretsk in Donetsk oblast.Video footage from the battlefieldappeared to confirm his claim that the east of the country was under Russian fire. White puffs of smoke could be seen above the village of Uspenivka, in the Pokrovsk area of Donetsk.The Russians also reportedlyattacked an evacuation convoyin the village of Zoria, near the city of Kostiantynivka. At least two civilians and a rescue worker from the Proliska aid agency were hurt when Russian drones targeted their cars.View image in fullscreenA military chaplain sprays holy water on service personnel during an Easter service near the frontline in Donetsk region.Photograph: Anatolii Stepanov/Reuters“For us, it’s just another day of war – with shelling from various types of weapons and even one attempt to assault our positions,” Denys Bobkov, the spokesperson for Ukraine’s 37th separate marine brigade, told the Guardian in a message from the front.Bobkov said that by 2pm on Sunday his brigade had recorded 16 drone attacks and two artillery strikes. It is fighting near the village of Novopavlivka, south-west of Pokrovsk and on the administrative border between Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts.The 66th brigade, based in the city of Lyman, also reported infantry attacks and attempts to repair damaged crossings. “The Russians are using the so-called ‘lull’ to improve their tactical position – to regroup in order to deliver another blow,” it said.In Moscow, Russia’s defence ministry claimed Ukraine had broken the ceasefire more than 1,000 times. It said there had been more than 900 drone strikes, with damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties. It did not give further details.After a bloody week, during which Russiakilled 35 people in a missile attack in the centre of Sumy, Ukrainian cities were relatively calm on Sunday. Worshippers gathered at St Volodymyr’s cathedral in Kyiv, where priests blessed their Easter baskets with Holy water.“They’ve already broken their promise. Unfortunately, we cannot trust Russia today,” Olga Grachova, 38, who works in marketing, told the news agency Agence France-Presse.View image in fullscreenA chaplain conducts an Easter service for soldiers to mark Easter on the frontline in the Zaporizhzhia region.Photograph: Andriy Andriyenko/APThe US has signalled it is losing patience with both sides. On Friday, Donald Trumpsaid he was ready to walk awayfrom his attempt to broker a peace settlement, declaring: “We want to get it done.”“Now if for some reason one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we’re just going to say: ‘You’re foolish. You’re fools. You’re horrible people’ – and we’re going to just take a pass,” he said. The US president denied claims that Putin was “playing” him.Late last night, Trump said on his Truth Social platform that he hoped Ukraine and Russia would make a deal this week and that both would “then start to do big business with the United States of America, which is thriving, and make a fortune”.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio,met European leaders in Parislast week to discuss how to end the war. Leaks suggest the White House is pushing for a Kremlin-friendly deal that would freeze the conflict along the existing 1000km-long frontline.Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, has suggested that Crimea and four other Ukrainian provinces could be given to Russia. The US is considering recognising Crimea as Russian and offering Moscow other incentives such as sanctions relief, Bloomberg reported.The Kremlin insists its original war goals must be achieved. They include the removal of Zelenskyy as Ukraine’s president, as well as the country’s “demilitarisation” and a guarantee of its non-Nato “neutral” status.Since theirdisastrous meeting in Februaryin the Oval Office, Zelenskyy has been seeking to improve relations with Washington. Last month, Ukraineaccepted a 30-day US ceasefire proposaland it is poised to sign an agreement on Thursday giving the US access to its minerals.There are hints, however, that Zelenskyy is growing frustrated at the White House’s pro-Putin rhetoric. Trump has piled pressure on Ukraine – in effect cutting off military aid and temporarily pausing intelligence sharing – while taking no corresponding measures against Russia.On Sunday, Zelenskyy appeared to take a swipe at Fox Television Stations after its Live Now network broadcast live coverage of Putin attending an Orthodox Easter service in Moscow with Russia’s patriarch, while incorrectly labelling Kyiv as part of Russia.“Instead of broadcasting religious service from Moscow, the focus should be on pressuring Moscow to genuinely commit to a full ceasefire and to maintain it for at least 30 days after Easter – to give diplomacy a real chance,” Zelenskyywrote on X.Ukraine’s foreign ministry said it had asked for an explanation. “If this was a mistake rather than a deliberate political statement, there should be an apology and an investigation into who made the mistake,” a ministry spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The UN said theyhad been killed “one by one”. Israel at first claimed that the medics’ vehicles did not have emergency signals on when troops opened fire but later backtracked after phone video recovered from one of the medics contradicted the account.The Gaza paramedic killings: a visual timelineRead moreOn Sunday, the military said an investigation had “identified several professional failures, breaches of orders, and a failure to fully report the incident”.As a result, the deputy commander ofthe IDF’s Golani Brigade“will be dismissed from his position due to his responsibilities as the field commander … and for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief”.Another commander, whose unit was in operation in the southern city of Rafah, where the killings took place, would be censured for “his overall responsibility for the incident”, the military said.0:15Bodies of health workers pulled from the burial site – videoDespite admitting mistakes, the report does not recommend any criminal action to be taken against the military units responsible for the incident and found no violation of the IDF’s code of ethics. The findings of the report will now be passed along to the military advocate general. Israel’s extreme-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, called the army chief’s decision to dismiss the responsible deputy commander “a grave mistake”.The Palestine Red Crescent rejected the findings.“The report is full of lies. It is invalid and unacceptable, as it justifies the killing and shifts responsibility to a personal error in the field command when the truth is quite different,” Nebal Farsakh, spokesperson for the Red Crescent, told AFP.Human rights lawyers also called the inquiry into question, pointing out that it had been done by Israel’s military itself and alleging it lacked independence.Sawsan Zaher, a Palestinian human rights lawyer based in Israel, said: “There is nothing objective or neutral about this inquiry. The severity of this case should have led to an immediate criminal investigation. Instead we see the Israeli military inquiring into itself and yet again evidence of violations of international law and war crimes are swept under the carpet.”The report maintains, without providing further evidence, that six of the 15 Palestinians killed were Hamas militants. Previous claims by Israel along the same lines have been denied by the Red Crescent.The investigation provided the most thorough account from Israel’s forces about what they alleged took place that night. According to the report, it was an “operational misunderstanding” by Israeli forces that led them to fire on the ambulances. They denied that there had been any “indiscriminate fire” and claimed troops were simply alert to “real threats” from Hamas on the ground, accusing the militant group of regularly using ambulances to transport weapons and terrorists.The investigation claimed that “poor night visibility” was to blame for the deputy battalion commander’s conclusion that the ambulances belonged to Hamas militants and the decision to fire on them.Video footage that emergedfrom the scene showed that the ambulances were clearly moving with flashing emergency lights.View image in fullscreenA still from a phone video taken by one of the medics killed, showing Red Crescent emergency vehicles with lights and sirens flashing and their logos clearly visible.Photograph: APThe investigation also found that the shooting of a UN vehicle, which drove past 15 minutes later, was carried out in violation of orders.Daniel Machover, a human rights lawyer who co-founded Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights, said the admission of the circumstances of the killing of the UN worker, who was in a clearly marked UN vehicle, “alone should be grounds for a court martial and a war crimes investigation, not simply a dismissal”.After uncovering the bodies from a sandy grave in Gaza days after the attack, a UN official said the workers had been killed “one by one”, while the head of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society has said the men were “targeted at close range”.Some witnesses and relatives have also alleged there was evidence that at least one of the victims hadhad their hands bound.‘What was their crime?’ Families tell of shock over IDF killing of Gaza paramedicsRead moreThe military’s report said there was “no evidence to supportclaims of executionor that any of the deceased were bound before or after the shooting”. Ahmed Dhair, the forensic pathologist in Gaza who carried out the postmortems on the victims, said last week that he had not seen visible signs of restraint.The Israeli military also defended the decision by soldiers to “evacuate” the bodies the next morning and claimed that while the decision to crush their vehicles was wrong, “there was no attempt to hide the incident”.Dhair told the Guardian last week that the postmortems showed the victims were mostly killedby gunshots to the head and torso, as well as injuries caused by explosives. Dhair alleged evidence of “explosive bullets” in the bodies he had examined.The Israeli statement on the findings concluded by saying that Israel’s military “regrets the harm caused to uninvolved civilians”. Asked if he thought the incident represented a pervasive issue within the Israeli military, Maj Gen Yoav Har-Even, who headed the inquiry, told journalists: “We’re saying it was a mistake, we don’t think it’s a daily mistake.”Last week, Palestinian Red Crescent said that one of the two Palestinian paramedics who had survived the shooting, Assad al-Nsasrah,remained in Israeli detention.View image in fullscreenTheir bodies were uncovered days after the shooting, buried in a sandy mass grave alongside their crushed vehicles.Photograph: PRCSPalestinians and international human rights groups have repeatedly accused Israel’s military of failing to properly investigate or whitewashing misconduct by its troops. A recentreport by Yesh Din, an Israeli human rights organisation, concluded that Israel “did not take appropriate action to investigate suspected violations of international law that occurred as part of its war in Gaza”.Ziv Stahl, the executive director of Yesh Din, said: “It’s another example of the almost full impunity given to soldiers for events in Gaza. In this case, I think they were quick to handle it because of the international pressure they are facing. By taking this small disciplinary action against one commander, it undermines any chance of a wider criminal investigation.”The international criminal court, established by the international community as a court of last resort, has accused the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the former defence minister Yoav Gallantof war crimes. Israel, which is not a member of the court, has long asserted that its legal system is capable of investigating the army, and Netanyahu has accused the ICC of antisemitism.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It will also be seeking to build three new sites to add “resilience and support our ramp-up of critical munitions production”.According to John Healey, the defence secretary, the defence industry “is the foundation of our ability to fight and win on the battlefield”.He said: “Strengthening homegrown artillery production is an important step in learning the lessons from Ukraine, boosting our industrial resilience and making defence an engine for growth.”BAE Systems said it has developed new methods to create the new weapons, describing it as an “innovative” way to keep up with demand while removing the need for nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine, which are high in demand across global supply chains.Previously, the company imported RDX explosives from two main sources, the US and France. However, it wants to be in a place where its munitions are deemed to be “Itar-free”, meaning it can be bought and sold on without anyrestrictions from the US.Steve Cardew, the business development director at BAE Systems’ maritime and land defence solutions, said: “Our leap forward in synthetic energetics and propellant manufacture will strengthen the UK’s supply chain resilience and support our ramp up of critical munitions production to meet growing demand in response to the increasingly uncertain world we’re living in.“It also supports economic growth through high-skilled jobs and potential export opportunities.”Explore more on these topicsDefence policyMilitaryBAE SystemsWeapons technologynewsShareReuse this content"

However, the party estimated that the real number of 24-hour cases was likely to be far higher because only 54 out of 141 trusts had provided full data.TheRoyal College of Nursing(RCN) said the figures “only begin to scratch the surface” of a “crisis in corridor care” – after reports of patients being seen in the corridors of hospitals due to a lack of beds. The RCN said the declining recruitment in nursing was adding to the problem.“The NHS and the UK government must begin to disclose the true scale of the problem if they’re serious about eradicating it,” general secretary and chief executive of the RCN Prof Nicola Ranger said. “A single patient waiting for more than 24 hours is unacceptable, tens of thousands waiting shows why corridor care must be eradicated. It is undignified and unsafe, and now a year-round crisis.The Lib Dems want the government to make a new team of “super-heads”, composed of experienced NHS bosses who would go into struggling trusts and bring them up to standard.“The least patients deserve is the dignity to be treated in an appropriate area,” Lib Dem health and social care spokesperson Helen Morgan said. “Not the ramshackle waiting rooms and corridors that far too many have to suffer through for hours.“That is why the government must ensure that this is the last winter crisis anyone will experience and end corridor care by the end of this parliament.“The Conservatives’ beyond-shameful neglect brought us to this point, but theLabourgovernment’s approach of sitting on its hands and hoping it all gets better has not survived contact with reality.”The current Labour government has made cutting NHS waiting lists one of its key missions.“We have taken action to protect A&E departments, introducing the new RSV vaccine, delivering more than 27m Covid and flu vaccines and ending the strikes so staff were on the frontline not the picket line for the first winter in three years,” a Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said.“This work continues to ensure patients are treated quickly. We are fundamentally reforming the NHS as part of our Plan for Change, providing more care in the community, so fewer patients have to go to A&E, and those who do are treated faster and with dignity.”A spokesperson for East Kent hospitals trust said: “We have seen increased attendances across our three main hospitals and we are sorry that patients are waiting longer than we would like in our emergency departments.”UniversityHospitalsof Liverpool group has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsNHSHospitalsHealthLiberal DemocratsLabourEnglandRoyal College of NursingnewsShareReuse this content"

But senior managers are behaving no differently to those running private water companies south of the border.”Scottish Water said it “did not recognise” the figures cited by Unison and said that the offer of 3.4% with a guaranteed increase of £1,400 would spell a 5.5% rise for the lowest-paid.It said contingency plans were in place to enable it to maintain normal services during the strikes and advised customers to report any problems with the water as usual.Peter Farrer, Scottish Water’s chief operating officer, said the offer was “fair and progressive”, adding: “No one benefits from industrial action, and our focus is on continuing to deliver for our millions of customers across Scotland. We urge the unions to get back round the negotiating table as soon as possible.”Unlike in England, the water boards in Scotland were never privatised, and Scottish Water has said that it reinvests all profits, currently about £800m a year, directly back into its infrastructure, a network of 30,000 miles of pipes and about 2,000 treatment works.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Gallagher brothers may be taking over the world’s stadiums this summer, but over onTikTokusers are moving to a different beat.Views of posts using electronic music as a soundtrack, including techno and house, outgrew those tagged for indie and alternative for the first time in 2024, according to the social media app.There were more than 13bn views of videos tagged #ElectronicMusic worldwide last year, an increase of 45% on 2023, representing faster growth than the “indie and alternative” and “rap and hip-hop” genres. Videos created with the electronic music tag grew by more than 100% over the same period.TikTok said creators were turning to electronic music in particular as a soundtrack for specific types of video clips, such as sport, fitness and fashion. It has also proved popular with travel content and summer holiday recaps.TikTok’s head of music partnerships for the UK and Ireland, Toyin Mustapha, said the success of British artists such as Disclosure and Joel Corry had underlined electronic music’s entry into the mainstream.“Dance music has become more accessible and big in the commercial sphere,” he said. “We are seeing the breaking down of boundaries for artists, and TikTok is part of that.”TikTok, which has more than 1 billion users worldwide, has become a major platform for breaking and supporting music artists. One of the biggest summer anthems of last year, Adam Port’s Move, established its appeal on the app before becoming a streaming hit. It reached the top 10 in the UK and across Europe. Another hit on TikTok and streaming platforms last year was Pawsa’s Dirty Cash (Money Talks), which reached No 17 in the UK charts.Fred Again’s headlining sets at the Reading and Leeds festivals have underlined the ascent of electronic artists in major markets, but Mustapha also points to mainstream chart success. Jazzy become the first female Irish act to reach No 1 in Ireland in more than a decade in 2023.“It’s not just reflected in festival bookings, you can see it in the official charts as well,” he said.Two British DJs have also taken off on TikTok in recent years. Hannah Laing, aformer dental nurse from Dundeeknown as the queen of “doof”, has launched her own festival and label after building a steady music career on the app.Billy Gillies, a Belfast DJ whose hits include DNA (Loving You) has also built a strong following on the platform.UK views of videos with the #ElectronicMusic hashtag grew 22%, while the number of videos created with the same hashtag rose by more than 50%.“TikTok users tend to tag the genres of music, especially genres like electronic music. It shows the community they are trying to build and are part of, and electronic music is very much a community-led thing,” Mustapha said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last year, TikTok flagged a trend called “Britishcore”, which celebrated the more mundane aspects of UK life but also captured excitement over the Gallagher brothers’ reunion. The hashtag #OasisReunion received more than 100m video views in thefortnight after their comeback tour was announced.As well as a boom in electronic music, British TikTok users alsoembraced the music industry’s back cataloguelast year. TikTokers set a new high for use of old tracks on British posts, with tunes more than five years old accounting for 19 out of the 50 top tracks in 2024. Popular back catalogue tunes included Sade’s Kiss of Life and Sophie Ellis-Bextor’s Murder on the Dancefloor.As with electronic music, the trend was also global. Twenty of the top 50 tracks worldwide came from back catalogues, led by the 1980s hit Forever Young by the German synth-pop band Alphaville.Explore more on these topicsTikTokElectronic musicIndienewsShareReuse this content"

So why does Britain continue to have one of the most expensive electricity markets in the world? Industrial users complain those costs are driving companies out of business and discouraging investment in the UK.The reason behind Britain’s sky-high wholesale energy costs is simple, according to experts. It is down to Britain’s reliance on gas – the price of which was sent soaring by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – in power plants and home heating.Wholesale gas and electricity prices graphic“Great Britain’s dependency on gas imports has been the most important factor behind higher gas and power prices in the market,” Kate Mulvany, the principal consultant at the energy advisory company Cornwall Insight, said.Prof Michael Grubb of the UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources said in a recent research paper that, although fossil fuels used to be cheaper than renewable energy sources, “that has turned on its head as gas prices shot up and the cost to produce renewables such as wind and solar power has plummeted”.He said: “If we actually paid the average price of what our electricity now costs to produce, our bills would be substantially cheaper.”However, gas-fired power plants in effect set the market price for electricity – meaning costs are substantially higher than they could be. In simple terms: the price in the electricity market on any given day is dictated by the most expensive source of generation available, which in the UK would be itsgas-fired power plants.Under this “marginal pricing” system, the UK’s electricity market price is set by gas 98% of the time, the highest rate acrossEuropeand well above the EU average of just under 40%.UK’s electricity market price is set by gas 98% of the timeIn some cases, the soaring cost of firing up older gas plants to meet an increase in demand can cause market prices to rocket. Earlier this year, two gas power plants were paid more than £12mto supply only three hours of electricityafter freezing weather led to some of the highest market prices since the energy crisis began.This has contributed to higher bills for homes – the average household annual energy billrose by £111to £1,849 from this month. Meanwhile, inflated costs have also piled pressure on struggling businesses, and manufacturers, including Britain’s steelmakers, havesaid that high energy prices have disadvantaged themcompared with neighbouring countries. So what can the UK do about it?Use less gasEnergy industry experts have rallied behind the conclusion that cutting the UK’s reliance on gas is the key to cutting energy costs, too. By generating a greater proportion of the UK’s electricity from renewable energy and nuclear reactors, electricity costs would begin to fall as gas use dwindles.“There’s no magic number below which bills will suddenly fall lower,” Mulvany said. “But the effect of gas markets on electricity costs would gradually fall,” she said.In France, for example, where nuclear reactors contribute more than two-thirds of its electricity, market prices tend to be lower because gas plants dictate the market price only 7% of the time. In Germany, where renewables make up more than half of its electricity, gas plants set the market price about a quarter of the time.By 2030, the UK government hopes to use gas-fired power to meet only 5% of its electricity annually. Plans set out by the National Energy System Operator suggest that in one scenario for the 2030 plan this would mean that gas sets the price in only 15% of hours, insulating consumers from “volatile international gas prices”.Take gas plants out of the marketUnder the government’s clean power plan, gas prices could still have an outsized impact on overall costs relative to its diminutive role in the future grid by setting the bar for the most expensive source of electricity.The answer, according to experts, is to intervene in the design of the market to stop the cost of gas plants from setting the price for the whole market.There are a number of ways that this could be handled. The government could choose to nationalise Britain’s last remaining gas plants so they could be used only when needed and, crucially, without participating in the electricity market and driving up its prices. This was proposed by Adam Bell, the government’s former head of strategy at the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and now a consultant at Stonehaven.There are more market-friendly options, too, which could include offering gas plant owners long-term supply contracts at a set price, which would allow them to recover their costs without distorting the market.Make better use of renewablesView image in fullscreenSolar panels in a field.Photograph: Steve Parsons/PAThe more renewable energy projects that are rolled out, the less expensive gas will be needed in the system. But industry experts believe that more can be done to harness renewable energy to lower costs. The key to making better use of renewable energy is tostore it when it is abundant– during windy and sunny periods – and use it when supplies are tight.A pan-European report by the clean energy thinktank Ember found that by 2030 wind and solar power generation could exceed domestic demand across all EU countries. The report found that could help the EU to avoid gas purchase costs worth €9bn annually.The energy regulator for Great Britain, Ofgem,hopesto unlock billions of pounds of investment into storage technologies.These are likely to include pumped hydropower projects – which pump water up into a reservoir when renewables are abundant and then release the water to generate electricity when renewables are scarce. Other technologies include liquid air energy storage, compressed air energy storage and “flow batteries”, which are in development.Divide the market into zonesOther plans to reform the market includedividing it up into different zones.Under these plans, the existing market for electricity could be replaced with seven market zones, each with their own prices. Areas in Scotland with high levels of clean electricity generation and low demand could expect lower prices, while urban areas in the south of England with high demand but limited renewable energy projects would have higher prices.Proponents of the plan believe that this would lower the costs of rewiring the UK’s electricity grids, funded through energy bills, by encouraging high energy users to migrate to areas of ample power supply, and developers to move closer to areas of high demand.Others fear that upending the market would drive renewable energy investors to countries that offer a more stable regulatory regime, making it harder for big renewable energy projects to be built in the UK before the government’s 2030 target.Cut policy costs from electricity billsEnergy bills are made up of more than just the market price – in addition to the cost of upgrading networks they also carry the cost of subsidies to support new low-carbon energy projects.For years, industry policy experts have warned that adding extra levies to electricity bills makes it more expensive for people to cut their reliance on fossil fuels by taking up electric vehicles or heat pumps.View image in fullscreenEnergy bills are made up of more than just the market price.Photograph: Jacob King/PAInstead, the government could move these levies on to gas bills to encourage people to opt for cleaner options or absorb them into general taxation to avoid saddling those who cannot afford to upgrade their car or home heating systems with higher costs.Lowering the overall demand for gas should help lower wholesale gas prices, which would ease the upward pressure on electricity prices, too.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryGasEnergy billsRenewable energyEnergyConsumer affairsEuropeexplainersShareReuse this content"

Even a committed atheist can’t help but feel completely upliftedLucy ManganSun 20 Apr 2025 17.00 EDTShareIam of the generation that grew up believing that Robert Powell was Jesus. This is because in my day you knew Easter was around the corner not because of the bastardised diffusion lines of Creme Eggs infesting the supermarkets (White chocolate? Caramel? Come on!), but because the TV schedules suddenly filled with truth ’n’ resurrection-based programming, central to which was the annual showing of Franco Zeffirelli’s four-part 1977 series Jesus of Nazareth. Powell played the Messiah and anyone else who was anyone in 1977 (Laurence Olivier, Christopher Plummer, Anthony Quinn, Ernest Borgnine, Rod Steiger, Peter Ustinov, Michael York, you name it) played the rest of the cast of the Bible. It was as much part of the season as making palm crosses at school or egg-hunting in the garden.It is possibly still available somewhere out there in the fragmentary world of streaming, if you want to unearth it from underneath the secular detritus at a suitable moment. But it’s not the same as when it’s featured in terrestrial TV’s regularly scheduled seasonal programming.On the face of it, Pilgrimage: The Road Through the Alps looks like a shoddy attempt by the BBC to fulfil some embarrassing clause lingering in its public service remit. Seven celebrities of different faiths and none are sent off to walk and bus the 190 miles of the Austrian Camino, a revived medieval Catholic route that finishes in the foothills of the Swiss Alps. Together, they see what they can learn about themselves, about faith and about medieval Catholic fortitude as they try to imagine crossing the Alps in the days before Gore-Tex and Craghoppers.But – a miracle! Pilgrimage quickly reveals itself to be not too bad and, before the three episodes are up, you could be moved to call it really quite good and admit that the whole experience has, against all odds and expectations, been rather uplifting.Mostly, this is down to the fact that all the pilgrims take it seriously – not sombrely, but seriously – and are willing to talk honestly and thoughtfully about what God and religion mean to them. No artificial timeline has been imposed on their trek – this is not an unseemly race from Innsbruck in Austria to Einsiedeln Abbey in Switzerland but a genuine (yes, yes, within the constraints of a programme still needing to be made) chance for the group to get to know each other, reflect on their past and current experiences, be influenced by each other and deepen rather than cheapen their thoughts. And there is no engineered conflict. In fact, no conflict worth the name at all. It is striking and rather wonderful.The Wanted singer Jay McGuiness was raised Catholic but now describes himself as agnostic. He is, he says, still searching for the catharsis faith once gave him. And he is still grieving for his bandmate Tom Parker, who died three years ago from a brain tumour, brutally young and brutally soon after diagnosis.Harry Clark (former soldier, second winner of The Traitors and, according to his mum “the smartest dumbest person … I’m just wired backwards”) is a fellow Catholic, who still believes. But he seems almost more entranced to be in the company of people talking about history and ideas as they yomp along than by the possible presence of the divine at the various ancient monasteries and convents they visit.ComedianHelen Ledereris feeling the pull of her father’s Jewish heritage and the unspoken grief her family carried. “But you don’t want to overclaim it,” she says, as she tries to feel her way along the boundary between the effects of trauma and experiencing the trauma yourself. Again, a rare subtlety in such shows, in which overclaiming is virtually a requirement.Paralympian Stefanie Reid has a strong Christian faith, born of the accident that nearly killed her and led to her becoming an amputee in her teens. Comedian Daliso Chaponda (further marking the documentary out from the herd by being naturally funny and thoughtful by turns, instead of a relentless joke seeker and teller), who grew up in 14 countries as the son of a refugee, has sampled a number of Christian denominations and is hoping to find one that truly feels like home.Journalist Nelufar Hedayat’s Muslim family came to the UK as refugees from Afghanistan when she was seven. She is struggling with the anger she feels towards Islam and how to unpick a religion from its cultural expression and enforcement by – for example – the people who are, in her native country, forcibly silencing women.There is, by the end of three episodes – which are full of the most gorgeous scenery, and I will take a travelogue too, if anyone is listening – actual growth and learning. As a committed atheist, it didn’t bring me any closer to God, but it may just have renewed my faith in celebrity documentaries.Pilgrimage: The Road Through the Alps review is on iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewHelen LedererreviewsShareReuse this content"

Then, a tiptoe through the slopes of early spider orchids and wild cabbage before a dizzying scramble down to the edge of the cliff.Teams of hardy volunteers will be making the trip this spring, come rain or shine, to try to solve the mystery of the Purbeck puffins.This stretch of Dorset coast is the last known regular nesting site forpuffinson the mainland of southern England. In the 1950s, there were about 80 birds nesting on this coast but the number of pairs has dropped to three and there have been no definitive sightings of fledglings for years. If the trend is not reversed, the colony will probably vanish within 15 years.“It is very worrying,” said the marine ornithologist Richard Caldow, who has been monitoring the birds since 2023. “In recent years, only three nesting pairs of puffins have been seen, along with a few adolescent birds. Without intervention, they are probably facing extinction here.”View image in fullscreenRichard Caldow scans the sea at Scratch Arse quarry for incoming puffins.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianThe problem is that no one is quite sure what intervention is needed because it is unclear what is ailing the puffins. “The mystery is why they declined but didn’t go extinct completely. I’ve spent many hours sat here trying to puzzle it out,” said Caldow.The craggy characteristics of the spot makes the puffins hard to observe. The entrance to only one nest site is visible from the vantage point, and the crucial spot is deep in a crevice. The other two are tucked around the cliff corner. When they leave the nest, fledglings tend to vanish at night so to work out if there are any there you have to look out for fish deliveries.The puffins carried fish to their nests for three weeks in 2023 but stopped abruptly, suggesting that the fledglings died suddenly. The birds began building nests in 2024, but were not seen delivering any fish, probably because their eggs failed to hatch.Caldow said watching out for the Purbeck puffins bringing in fish required patience. “They are good at appearing out of nowhere and disappearing again,” he said.View image in fullscreenTwo puffins at the Scratch Arse quarry site.Photograph: John AllenThe technique is to spot them as they approach with the naked eye then peer through binoculars as they near the cliff. “It’s easy to be distracted by a dolphin fin or peregrine falcon passing by,” he said.Together with theNational Trustand theDorset Wildlife Trust, Caldow oversaw the placing of motion-sensor cameras in a narrow fissure where the puffins nest.Volunteers combed through more than 70,000 images in search of clues to the crisis, perhaps raids by rats or crows.

When the Guardian visited, one was bobbing 200 metres (200 yards) out to sea.Caldow went through the possible reasons for the decline. The peregrine falcons and herring gulls are not top of his list of suspects. “They have better, easier food sources elsewhere,” he said.Humans – boaters, climbers and coasteering groups – are also thought to be in the clear. Most know to avoid the cliff and it used to be an industrial landscape when it was quarried. The puffins were not put off by humans digging and blasting, so they would probably not be disturbed by a few people now.The climate emergency could be a factor. Perhaps the puffins are struggling to find enough food – but the razorbills that also nest at the site seem to be thriving.Though they were not caught on camera, Caldow’s prime suspects are carrion crows, jackdaws, rats and mice, which could squeeze into the crevices.As he sits on the cliff, he dreams up possible solutions – perhaps sealing back and side entrances to the nesting site with concrete? But that wouldn’t go down well on a stretch of world heritage coast. Constructing an artificial cliff face that predators couldn’t access? Very expensive.It is probable that some of the same puffins return to the Purbeck coast year in and year out. They can live for up to 30 years and one of the regulars has a distinctive greyish back. But when they leave, they travel far afield and a fear is that if one or two got caught in a nasty winter storm, they might not make it back.“It wouldn’t take too much to push them over the edge,” said Caldow. “This may be the last chance saloon for them.”Explore more on these topicsDorsetBirdsAnimalsEnglandWildlifeConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s some advice from an expertJoel SnapeSun 20 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Apr 2025 16.31 EDTShareThe gym is back. In the UK, about11.5 million people aged 16 and over now belong to one. Even old habits are making a comeback: after a few years of exhorting people to socially distance and wipe down machines, gym chains areremoving cleaning stations, while their clientele go back to sharing kit and sweating all over the benches. Nature, as they say, is healing.But how many people are using their membership, and how much value are they getting out of the gym when they go? As a former editor of Men’sFitnessmagazine, I have been going to gyms for more than a decade, and I still see half a dozen things I wish I could mention to people every time I go. So here are the tips I wish were in every gym’s welcome pack, alongside a bunch of the mistakes that it took me years to learn I was making. I am not going to tell you to wipe up your sweat, though. Hopefully, you are doing that already.Yes, people are looking at youView image in fullscreenDon’t believe the lie that no one will watch you.Photograph: Hinterhaus Productions/Getty ImagesIn lists of advice for the gym-shy, you often see something like: “Nobody else is watching what you’re doing, or even cares – they’re all too focused on their own workouts.”This is a bit like telling children that all bullies are secretly cowards – it is a nice thing to say, but it isn’t true. People watch and judge others everywhere, and the gym is no exception. Unless you are somewhere incredibly quiet and you’re supernaturally focused, you will occasionally see someone checking out what you are doing – glancing at what weights you are lifting, or how fast you have set the treadmill.The good news? This usually doesn’t much matter, because it is vanishingly unlikely that they are going to interact with you, at least if you are male. “For women, there’s more of a problem with people wanting to comment on your form – either to correct it, or compliment you on it,” says my wife, who has beena personal trainer for more than a decade. She advises: “My general advice is to Wear headphones, look purposeful, and keep your response to a noncommittal: ‘Thanks.’ It’s going to happen sometimes, but it doesn’t have to ruin your workout.”‘Working in’ is definitely a skill worth learningFor some reason, probably due to the years of social distancing – the noble art of sharing bits of kit has fallen out of fashion over the past few years. But if you train in a crowded gym, there is a chance that you will have to do it occasionally, so it is worth knowing the proper form. Generally speaking wait until the other person has finished their set of exercises (usually marked by them putting the weight down; machines such as the leg press and pec deck are trickier, as people tend to stay seated between sets, but the same principles apply), then catch their eye and politely ask how many sets they have left.Depending on how many this is, and how long they are resting for between each, it is fine to ask if you can “work in”, or do your exercises while they are resting. They can always refuse, but there is nothing wrong with posing the question. Obviously, the reverse applies if someone asks you to work in – and you might one day graduate to asking the obviously nervous person hovering around your rack if they need to use it. That’s advanced stuff, though – so for now, concentrate on the next bit …Using the squat rack correctly is easyHere is what every experienced gym person says to themselves at least once a week when they catch a glimpse of someone squatting with a barbell: “Put the hooks lower.”In case you are completely unfamiliar with them, a squat rack works like this: a set of adjustable hooks holds the bar, you get underneath it, lift it up, then back out and do your set. The tricky bit? Lots of people put the hooks too high, so they are going up on tiptoe to remove or return the bar, which isn’t ideal at any weight, but gets downright dangerous when you are lifting heavy.Put them lower: you should quarter-squat the bar out of the rack, then, when it’s time to put it back, walk it straight into the upright part of the rack then let it drop into the hooks. Speaking of which …You are supposed to put your kit backView image in fullscreenDon’t leave your dumbbells lying around.Photograph: Kilito Chan/Getty ImagesThis isn’t always obvious – we have all been to gyms that look like a teenager’s bedroom – but it is generally considered bad form to leave dumbbells, plates and handles for the machines on the floor when you finish with them. Think of it like a cooldown from the rest of your workout, or like holding a door for someone: nobody’s going to make you do it, but it is annoying for everyone if you don’t.Don’t stand in front of the dumbbell rackAgain, the temptation to do this is understandable: dumbbells are heavy, and if you stand right next to the rack, you can watch your form in the mirror. But standing less than an arm’s length from all the other dumbbells means that fellow gym-goers will have to squeeze past (or wait for you to finish your set) because they will need the weights you are standing in front of.It’s fine to ask for adviceHonestly, almost nobody does this, but when it happens, it is delightful. If you’re not sure about something, whether it’s if you are doing a move correctly or how to lower the seat on a Wattbike (more complicated than you might expect), just ask someone. The worst that can happen is that they tell you they’re a bit busy.… or a spotterThere aren’t many movements for which you need a “spotter” ready to step in and save you if you are struggling with weights – bench press is by far the most common – but if you really feel you need one to crank out a couple of extra reps, the protocol is simple. Find someone who looks as if they know what they are doing, wait until they are at a break, then ask if they would mind spotting you. Let them know how many repetitions of your exercise you are aiming for and how much help you would like (if the answer to this is “none”, that’s fine).If you are on the bench, they might offer to help you with a “lift-off” – taking the bar out of the upright supports. If you take this, give them a clear “My bar!” to let them know when you’re happy that the weight’s under control. Once you’re done, “Done!” or “Take it!” lets them know you could use some help with putting the weight back.Bands aren’t the best way to do pull-upsYes, I know theyseemto work. Put both your feet in a band and, depending on its strength, you can happily twang yourself through plenty of pull-ups even if you can’t ordinarily do even one, so what’s the issue? Well, bands don’t really give you a uniform amount of help. You are barely putting in any effort at the bottom of the move (where the band’s fully stretched), and getting almost no assistance at the top. A better way to do it is to focus on “eccentric”reps: use a box or a step (or a little jump) to get your head over the bar, then lower yourself as slowly as you can. Do this two or three times, rest and repeat for a couple of sets, and then you are done for the day (overdoing eccentric reps is a very easy way to make yourself sore). You will be doing unassisted pull-ups long before the people still struggling with bands. By the way, in the gym “eccentric” is often pronounced “e-centric”. Go figure.Not all trainers are created equalHere’s a secret: it’s possible to get your level 3 personal trainer qualification, the minimum that most gyms demand, in about five weeks. Lots of personal trainers are lifelong students of exercise, who constantly do courses, read studies and experiment on themselves to fine-tune their knowledge – but more than a few don’t bother with any of that.In general, it is a good sign if a trainer can point to clients who have got the results you’re looking for, with the same limitations you have. If they are touting six-week, six-pack transformations, make sure they weren’t doing them all with responsibility-free twentysomethings. Good trainers will also be able to explain why you are doing the moves and how to do them in a way that makes sense to you. And while it is nice to build up a rapport with your trainer, it is fine to be a bit wary of one who spends more time talking than taking you through your workout.Burpees really aren’t all that greatView image in fullscreenLove them or hate them … burpees.Photograph: kovaciclea/Getty ImagesBurpees are a love/hate thing: coaches love putting them into workouts because they are an easy way to tire people out; everyone else hates them because they are horrible. But it is also worth understanding that they aren’t necessarily that beneficial. Invented by an American physiologist, Royal Huddleston Burpee Sr (yes, really), they were originally intended to be done to a strict four-count, and not for more than 20 seconds at a time. If you are already in shape and injury-free, there is nothing wrong with them, but if you haven’t been to the gym in a while, then all the jumping, bouncing, flopping to the floor and hauling yourself back up is going to be hard on your joints (your wrists in particular).If you want to push yourself through a high-intensity finisher, consider something zero-impact instead. The rower, exercise bike and Ski-Erg are all excellent options.We are all rooting for youI have saved the heartfelt tip for the end, but this is really true. In my gym, I constantly see people who go from making their first stumbling steps into fitness to building a bunch of confidence (and muscle) – and it’s great! Every time! Obviously, I can’t fist-bump everyone who suddenly builds a set of biceps, or congratulate every stranger I see trying really hard on the treadmill, but please understand that most people in the gymwantto see you succeed.There is something great about the camaraderie of a big gym full of clanking weights and thumping treadmills, and every hardworking person brings up the energy.

What’s the mood of staff and residents at its home base in Nottinghamshire?Sarah ButlerSun 20 Apr 2025 04.00 EDTShare‘We’ve had several rounds of cost-cutting and it could happen again,” says aBootsworker. Fears are running high as the Nottinghamshire-based chemist prepares to change hands – perhaps twice in quick succession.The US private equity firm Sycamore Partnersis close to finalising a $10bn (£7.8bn) dealto take over the listed US owner ofBoots, Walgreens Boots Alliance.Experts say Sycamore is then likely to sell off assets, having previously employed this tactic with varying degrees of success at office supplies group Staples and the former owner of the footwear brand Kurt Geiger, Jones Group. It could look at picking off some aspects of Boots – such as stores, property or brands – but is more likely to sell on the entire business.Boots – which operates more than 1,800 stores and employs about 51,000 people – including about 6,000 at its headquarters in Beeston, three miles south-west of Nottingham – has already been unsuccessfully put on the block by Walgreens at least twice in recent years, with a valuation of as much as £5bn.The company has changed hands several times in the past 20 years. After amerger with Alliance Unichem in 2006, the combined firm was taken over byprivate equity firm KKR in 2007, before Walgreens first took a 45% stake in 2012 and thencompleted a takeoverat the end of 2014.View image in fullscreenBeeston resident Michelle Aduhene worries about the knock-on effect changes at Boots could have on the town.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The ObserverBut there are concerns now that this latest change of ownership could see the chain of stores, many of which already need more investment in equipment, staff and maintenance, take another hit.Nowhere is that more keenly felt than in Nottingham, where Boots is the city’s biggest private-sector employer and has been a key to its identity since founder John Boot opened a small herbalist store on Goose Gate in 1849. The group has been based at its 112-hectare headquarters site in Beeston since 1927.One Boots worker says: “There won’t be any regret we are no longer part of Walgreens. We have always been seen as a small part of that group. Before that Boots was Boots.” However, he adds: “The fear is more stores close or there is yet another round of reducing staff in stores.”Another staff member says: “Private equity are in it to make money as quickly as they can and are not really bothered about the consequences.”The high street is very uncertain at the moment. Who will be looking to buy into a retailer with such a huge presence?Boots worker, BeestonOn Beeston high street, several locals say they used to work for Boots or have friends and family who still do.Jessica Stanley, 38, is suspicious of private equity firms “because they are thinking about shareholder profits and not value of the business to the community. I guess I would be concerned there’s a risk the company might be gutted.”Michelle Aduhene, 50, compares any potential change to theclosure of bicycle maker Raleigh’sNottingham factory two decades ago. “They built the university [on the old factory site] and that brought students, but does it bring money? It’s worrying.” She points to the hit local businesses that also benefit from Boots’ employees’ trade could face.However, several staff tell theObserverthey would be quite relaxed about a new regime as they have already survived a lot of cost-cutting and restructuring under its various owners, including Walgreens. “It all happens so far up the line it won’t affect us,” says one.The vast Boots campus still hints at a huge empire – but much of it is now rented out to other companies, some buildings lie empty and about 17 hectares have been sold off to builder Keepmoat for redevelopment into housing.Occupants are continuing to move out. Alliance Healthcare, the owner of Boots’s former wholesale arm, announced plans to close its warehouse in Beeston next year, shortly after Fareva – the French owner of Boots’s former manufacturing arm, which makes products for its No7, Soltan and Liz Earle ranges – exited late last year.There are rumours that more of the site could be sold for redevelopment, with Boots apparently assessing its vacant properties, although the company does not confirm this. Some locals feared a big swathe of student housing could be built, but local property experts say it would be tough to sell off large expanses of the site because of its complex nature.It has several stunning listed buildings – including the art-deco former factory, which is now MediCity, a hub for biotechnology, health and beauty startups which has a number of spaces vacant – and modernist glass monolith D10, which until recently housed Fareva.With Boots’s manufacturing and wholesale businesses already hived off, there are few divisions left that can be easily sold. However, the own-label beauty brands, including Liz Earle and No7, became a separate company about 10 years ago and could potentially be attractive to an international beauty specialist, according to industry experts. The No7 brand is now sold in the US via Walgreens and other retailers, but is also seen as key to Boots’s appeal in Britain.Boots has been offering services such as obesity clinics and vaccinations, so there are new areas for potential growthStore closures then would be an obvious way to go – as evidenced by the complete exit of rival chemist chain Lloyds from the high street after it was bought by private equity.Boots has already closed more than 300 outlets in recent years but it still has a very high number of stores. Any new owner is likely to look closely at the chain’s property footprint, given the rising costs of high street retail, the shift of trade to online, and competition from discounters such as Savers, Lidl and Home Bargains.Over a quarter (27%) of Boots staff surveyed in a poll by campaign group Organise said they feared their job would be less secure and more than a third (36%) said they felt conditions could get worse in the event of a takeover.As one worker puts it: “Because the high street is a very uncertain place at the moment, who is going to be looking to buy into a retailer with such a huge high street presence?”A listing on the stock exchange is seen as unlikely, given the current volatile situation on public markets and scepticism about growth in consumer companies, so a private sale is seen as more likely.“Boots has improved dramatically in recent years,” says one source who knows the business well, pointing to the chain’s greater focus on beauty counters and use of technology to grab a share of the online market.“But Boots is very hard to grow as it has got such big market share in most of the markets it is in, and is incessantly under attack from emerging market players. As its market share is so high there is almost only one way to go.View image in fullscreenBoots headquarters in Beeston, Nottinghamshire.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Observer“Someone could run it for cash and slowly underinvest in stores but it has been through that already.”In recent years, the brand has ridden a strong beauty market, reporting a 1.6% rise in sales in the three months to the end of February. Underlying sales at its pharmacies and its retail business, excluding the impact of currency and store closures, both rose about 5%, while Boots.com sales soared 20%.But staff say that government contracts for pharmacy services make it difficult to cover costs, and Boots has already reduced pharmacy trading hours in many stores, so counters can be closed even when the rest of the store is open.Workers also point to poor maintenance in some stores and fewer staff, meaning tills are unattended or increasingly automated, which they say is not good for older shoppers.Previously interested parties include India’s Reliance Industries and restructuring expert Apollo Global Management. CVC, Bain Capital and Asda owner TDR Capital also looked at the group but balked at the then mooted price of at least £5bn.Stefano Pessina, the entrepreneur behind all the deals at Boots since it merged with his Alliance Unichem business in 2006, is likely to be kingmaker. Those who know him suggest he could keep a stake in Boots and may want to be involved in its future – if he sees a way to make money from it.Not everyone is so sceptical. Another source who knows Boots well argues: “There is as much a case for investment as there is for stopping it. It could go more digital.”With an ageing UK population and the Labour government’s increased focus on primary healthcare, where Boots has been increasingly offering services such as obesity clinics and vaccinations, there are new areas for potential growth.“Boots is thriving, not just surviving, and if it was able to use more of its cash, who knows? There is a change in emphasis in the UK and, on a 10-year view, there is a big opportunity,” says the source.Explore more on these topicsBootsThe ObserverPrivate equityRetail industryPharmaceuticals industryBeautyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There’s something about the way the town was created that appeals, an eccentric idea that was based on nothing more than a desire for pleasure. (A bit like Las Vegas, but classier and French.) It was in 1837 when a wealthy Parisian lawyer decided to plant about 2,000 pines in the area for his hunting parties.Around 50 years later, a linoleum magnate from Leeds bought the town, attracting the British gentry with a horse track, casinos and golf course.View image in fullscreenThe market at Pas de Calais.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyAt the centre of its hedonistic history is Hotel Barrière Le Westminster, a grand redbrick, art deco building 10 minutes from the beach.

In 1962, Sean Connery signed his firstJames Bondfilm contract – the most luxurious suite is numbered 007 in tribute. The old-world glamour hasn’t dimmed; plush bedrooms twinkle with art deco touches, in the pale wood panelling and modernist paintings on the walls. If you don’t stay, enjoy a drink at the elegant bar where their French 75 is a favourite.For budget chic nearby, there’s Hotel Castel Victoria, five minutes from the beach, with a cosy library, pool room and sun terrace. Every Thursday there’s the market at Le Marché Couvert du Touquet in the town centre, where you can find anything from vintage gold jewellery, pretty espadrille wedges for a tenner and an old-fashioned kitchen hardware store that you’ll never want to leave.

When others appeared exhausted, Biden was raring to go, Reed said. Biden showed “unbelievable stamina”.Speakingto the Guardianin January 2023, Whipple said Biden’s “inner circle” was “bullish about Biden’s mental acuity and his ability to govern. I never heard any of them express any concern and maybe you would expect that from the inner circle. Many of them will tell you that he has extraordinary endurance, energy.”Put it this way: much has happened since.Obviously, there was that whole 2024 election thing. You know – the one when Biden dropped out after a disastrous debate exposed his decline for all to see. There was also the day in February, before the campaign kicked off, when the special counsel Robert Hur declined to charge Biden with mishandling classified documents, because he found him too addled and sympathetic a prospective defendant.Hur wrote: “He did not remember when he was vice-president, forgetting on the first day of the interview when his term ended (‘If it was 2013 – when did I stop being vice-president?’) and forgetting on the second day of the interview when his term began (‘In 2009, am I still vice-president?’) … He did not remember, even within several years, when his son Beau died.”‘Biden was unaware of what was happening in his own campaign. Halfway through the session, the president excused himself and went off to sit by the pool.’Photograph: HarperCollins PublishersWhipple, a former CBS producer, has emerged as a go-to author on the White House and those who work there. In The Gatekeepers, he examined the lives of chiefs of staff. Then came The Fight of His Life. With hindsight, Whipple seems to have missed key evidence of Biden’s decline.But Whipple is back with a vengeance. Uncharted, his third book, hits Biden and his aides like a bludgeon.Kamala Harris, who became the Democratic nominee after Biden withdrew, fares little better: Whipple depicts a candidate who never should have been there, a sentiment repeatedly expressed by senior Democrats.Whipple had access. People talked. Ron Klain, Biden’s first chief of staff, is a key source – and demonstrates startling cognitive dissonance about Biden’s mental and physical decline. Klain says Biden should have stayed in the race – but also gives an absolutely witheringaccountof debate prep at Camp David.At his first meeting with Biden in Aspen Lodge, the president’s cabin, Klain describes Biden as “startled”. Whipple writes: “He’d never seen him so exhausted and out of it. Biden was unaware of what was happening in his own campaign. Halfway through the session, the president excused himself and went off to sit by the pool.” He fell asleep.“‘We sat around the table,’” says Klain in the book. “‘And I was struck by how out of touch with American politics he was. He was just very, very focused on his interactions with Nato leaders.’” Klain, Whipple writes, “wondered half-seriously if Biden thought he was president of Nato instead of the US”.Come the debate against Trump, Biden gave perhaps the worst performance of all time. He shuffled, he stared, he made verbal stumbles and gaffes. He handed Trump the win.Klain also tags Biden for skipping a post-debate meeting with progressives in favor of a family photoshoot with Annie Leibovitz.“‘You need to cancel that,’” Klain says he told Biden. “‘You need to stay in Washington. You need to have an aggressive plan to fight and to rally the troops.’” Biden rebuffed him and instead held a Zoom call with the progressives. It went badly.“‘All you guys want to talk about is Gaza … What would you have me do?’” Biden said. “‘I was a progressive before some of you guys were even in Congress.’”How do you remind people you’re old without saying you’re old?Whipple also pays attention to Trump. Susie Wiles, now Trump’s chief of staff, and Karl Rove, a veteran of the George W Bush White House, speak on the record. So does Paul Manafort, a campaign manager in 2016, later jailed and pardoned.“Democrats wanted to know why Harris had lost to Trump and his MAGA movement,” Whipple writes. “Susie Wiles wanted to know why Harris and her team had run such a flawed campaign.”Wiles did not view a Trump victory as inevitable. Whipple asks Wiles: “‘Did that mean Harris couldn’t have won?’”Trump’s campaign chair didn’t mince words.“‘We’ll never know,’” she replies, “‘because it didn’t seem like she even tried.’“‘Voters want authenticity … and they didn’t get that from her.’”Leon Panetta, chief of staff to Bill Clinton, echoed Wiles.“‘I thought they were thinking they could tiptoe into the presidency without getting anybody pissed off at them,’” he tells Whipple. “‘Baloney. You’ve got to make the American people understand that you’re tough enough to be president of the United States.’”Rove does take a jab at Trump and Chris LaCivita, the ex-Marine who became a senior adviser. Rove introduced LaCivita to Trump, via the late megadonor Sheldon Adelson, but didn’t think LaCivita would take the gig. “‘I’m surprised because I know what he thinks of Trump,’” Rove tells Whipple. “‘He thinks Trump’s an idiot.’”LaCivita condemned January 6, after which he “liked” a tweet that urged Trump’s cabinet to invoke the 25th amendment and remove him from power. LaCivitadeleted the post– but did not join the second Trump administration.Back in 2023, in The Fight of His Life, Whipple wrote: “Presidents do not give up power lightly.” Andy Card, chief of staff to George W Bush, weighed in: “‘If anybody tells you they’re leaving the White House voluntarily, they’re probably lying. This applies to presidents, of any age, who are driven by vast reserves of ego and ambition.’”Biden did go – but not voluntarily. In Uncharted, in merciless detail, Whipple shows he should have gone much sooner.Unchartedis publishedin the US by HarperCollinsExplore more on these topicsBooksJoe BidenBiden administrationKamala HarrisDonald TrumpUS politicsreviewsShareReuse this content"

These Hollywood film stars spoke out against the ex-studio boss’s abusive behaviour in 2017, fuelling the international #MeToo movement.But Weinstein’s crimes and bullying practices had a direct and lasting impact on many more, including unknown names who worked with him in London.These assistants and aspiring actors had to cope with the worst excesses of an entertainment industry that did not only countenance exploitation but accepted it as part of the deal.Lisa Rose, a British actor who worked at Weinstein’s Miramax office on Chelsea’s King’s Road in the 1990s, remains disturbed by memories of that time, and feels guilty about accidentally putting others at risk. Now, as Weinstein prepares to appear in court again in New York this week, facing aretrial of his two 2020 convictions, Rose is taking her message around Britain in a solo stage show.“I want to talk about it honestly because people have forgotten how widespread the damage was,” she said this weekend. “It was a culture that put young women at risk all the time. There are intimacy coaches now. It may be better now, but it has not gone away.”View image in fullscreenLisa Rose says everything in her one-woman show is rooted in fact, highlighting an industry that put ‘young women at risk all the time’.Photograph: Arachne PressRose’s candid one-woman show,Too Small to Tell, is designed to remind audiences how the film business allowed Weinstein to operate with impunity. Bosses were to be obeyed and aspiring actors and office juniors were fair game. Rose has changed the names of those involved, but says everything is rooted in fact: “I wanted to tell it from the perspective of an ordinary woman.”The appeal of the glamour of the smart offices and the A-list contacts file quickly palled for Rose as she became aware of the atmosphere of fear in the building whenever Weinstein was in the country. She soon learned his requests for an assistant to work with him alone in his room over at the Savoy hotel were to be avoided at all costs, but the shouting outbursts were impossible to dodge. Like many others, Rose says she was asked to perform demeaning tasks.The show, which has its final performance at London’s Gatehouse Theatre on 20 Apriland goes on next month toBrighton, also sets out the perils of auditioning and is frank about how common abuse was.“As an actress I had bad experiences both in a film and at auditions. Then I went to work as an assistant at Miramax, where it became apparent it was a big problem. I feel awful for getting a 17-year-old friend some office work there when I thought it was safe. She was assaulted. My show is about me realising that although these stories may be small, they are important.”Weinstein, 73, was the producer of major box office hits such asPulp FictionandShakespeare in Lovewhile he ran Miramax, alongside his younger brother, Bob. More than 80 people have now come forward to attest to his abuse since the initial investigations by theNew York Timesand theNew Yorkerled to his exposure. But he is now to be tried again at New York’s court of appeals after it was found last year that legal improprieties and prejudicial testimony may have influenced the original judgement against him, leading to his23-year prison sentence.The disgraced producer is due to plead not guilty, denying all counts of rape and sexual assault.Evidence will be presented once again accusing him of raping aspiring actor Jessica Mann in a Manhattan hotel in 2013 and committing a criminal sex act on TV production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006.Judge approves Harvey Weinstein’s request to sleep at hospital during retrialRead moreHe is also to be charged with another criminal sex act in Manhattan, based on a new allegation from an anonymous woman who was not part of the original trial.Frail and in poor health,Weinstein has been repeatedly hospitalised. But his lawyer, Arthur Aidala, claims that the full evidence now presented will confirm that his relationships were consensual and so persuade the jury he is not guilty.The three survivors of Weinstein’s alleged crimes are expected to testify over five to six weeks, with the trial likely to conclude at the end of May.Weinstein will not go free even if he is acquitted because of his 16-year prison sentence for a 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles.However, his lawyers are currently arguing that this, too, should be re-examined, claiming the New York verdict would have influenced the judge’s calculation.This article was amended on 20 April 2025. An earlier version incorrectly includedSex, Lies and Videotapesamong films produced by Harvey Weinstein. His Miramax company was the film’s distributor once complete, but was not involved in its production. The article was also amended to remove an unrelated detail.Explore more on these topicsWomenThe ObserverHarvey Weinstein#MeToo movementTheatreUS crimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

As the Mail and Telegraph’s headlines were quick to inform their readers, yes, this means a “Black actor” in that iconic role.There is a real concern that Essiedu is drinking from a poisoned chalice – that he will be associated with an author who isat the forefrontof a gender-critical movement that has succeeded in redefining the rights of trans people to their detriment; that he will have to weather the racist storm ofPotterheadsenraged at the diversion from “book accuracy” (Snape is described as having “sallow skin”); and deal with opportunists looking to illustrate their next rant about how the world has succumbed to “woke orthodoxy”. All of this in a show that is slated to last a decade.I’m sceptical about colour-blind casting, especially when it’s presented as a magic bullet for diversity concerns in the arts – but I can’t help but enjoy the audacity of Black Snape. If any performances from the original films were going to be rethought considerably – considering that casting so far is relatively aligned in appearance, bar a more handsome Quirrell – Snape is the most obvious choice. Alan Rickman’s depiction was so singular that any actor who hewed closely to it would likely be written off as doing a pastiche. He is also arguably the most complex and tragic figure in the series, inviting the most interpretation. So why not play around with it a bit?Many detractors are insistent that they would’ve been OK with, say, a Black Dumbledore or a Black Professor McGonagall, but that the details of Snape’s arc within the series are made invariably more touchy and loaded if the character is Black. Harry and his friends’ suspicion of their potions professor is down to sensing a menacing, scheming intent behind his cold disposition. Cue the imagined new Snape going:Is it cause I’m Black?Harry’s dad, James, and his friends bullied Snape at school in the 1970s, making him levitate and then hanging him upside down. If unchanged in the new series (this somewhat depends on the casting of James’s friends) this could now look like an image of racist bullying. Perhaps that would make James Potter irredeemable, particularlyconsidering the real experiencesof Black people in boarding schools – or it could simply deepen the series’ depiction of vulnerability and torment.View image in fullscreenAlan Rickman as Severus Snape with Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley and Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, 2005.Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarIt is worth pointing out that Snape being portrayed by a Black actor isn’t automatically the same as there being a “Black Snape”. HBO could simply gloss over the racial implications behind such a decision – after all, the bigotries and oppression system of “muggles” do not neatly map on to the magical world.But, if executed well, this casting represents an opportunity. I am incredibly intrigued by this idea of a Black man who is socially ostracised in his youth and then joins the Death Eaters (akin to an extremist, white supremacist party in the real world); who realises the errors in his ways, and gives his life in service of redeeming this mistake. The story alone doesn’t necessarily need the dynamics of race, but who in our current times may be better placed to represent such internal conflict, yearning for acceptance and a defection from such ideologies than a Black actor?In Clint Dyer and Roy Williams’ play Death of England, Essiedumasterfully playeda Black working-class Brexit-voting bailiff in what was a compelling psychological profile of the alienation experienced in desperately trying to reconcile aspirations for whiteness in a world that hates you. Similarly, Snape’s backstory of joining the Death Eaters is complicated by him being a “half blood” who joins a blood purity cult advocating for a standard he does not meet.Rather than a hasty imposition on the text, dig a little and a Black Snape starts to look like a much richer prospect – and yes, not too complex for a children’s series where all the themes of prejudice, identity and acceptanceare already present. Whether the creators will approach the issue with such consideration, sensitivity and context however remains to be seen.Quiet as it’s been kept,Paapa Essieduis one of the finest British actors that I’ve ever had the privilege to see perform– he is eminently commanding on the stage, emotionally precise and able to balance humour and solemnity. In his Emmy-nominated turn in Michaela Coel’sI May Destroy You, he expertly captured the sense of beinghaunted by trauma. So why shouldn’t he cash in on one of the series’ most iconic roles rather than settle for a minor side character so as not to upset those who would only find something else in the series to complain about anyway?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Verstappen was adjudged to have been at fault and given a five-second penalty but he maintained his place at the front in clean air.The Dutchman pushed hard but could not open a wide enough lead to cover the penalty and Piastri held his nerve and his cool to ease ahead through the pit stops, after which his pace and superior tyre wear paid off and he exercised iron control to take the flag by 2.8sec.Charles Leclerc took Ferrari’s first podium in third, Lando Norris was fourth for McLaren in a strong comeback drive from 10th on the grid, and George Russell was fifth for Mercedes. Lewis Hamilton could not match his Ferrari teammate, taking seventh.For Piastri then, his third win this year was another strong statement of intent after dominant wins in Bahrain and China. Based on his performance on the high-speed challenge of the Jeddah Corniche Circuit which demands commitment for a quick lap, his confidence and equanimity in how the McLaren handles under him was once more clear and sits in stark contrast with his teammate Norris, who was considered the championship favourite.Piastri wielded it in Jeddah with the same controlled aplomb as he has all season and it is paying off. He now leads the world championship for the first time in his short career, 10 points ahead of Norris with Verstappen in third, 12 points back.F1 driver standingsVerstappen and Red Bull, however, will still consider this a strong result. In Bahrain Verstappen could manage only sixth place, his car a recalcitrant beast, lacking in almost every area and left floundering against the dominant McLaren and indeed Mercedes and Ferrari. He was wrestling with it through waves of frustration and ire, made clear to his team in no uncertain terms.Yet the Red Bull was quick and handling well in Jeddah, another indication of how on any given weekend it can veer from fearsome to frightful, according to whether it finds an increasingly narrow operating window but this was nonetheless a strong performance from driver and team.He and Red Bull were aggrieved at the penalty but might consider the better option would have been to have Verstappen hand the place back immediately rather than risk censure, although regardless he did not look to have the pace to deny Piastri across the race.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This was better than he expected, having warned that he believed fifth or sixth might be the best he could manage.On a counterstrategy of opening on the hard tyres Norris once again demonstrated he is far more comfortable with the McLaren in race pace rather in the very edge over a single lap in qualifying.He chastised himself for his crash on Saturday and is more than well aware that given his issues with the car he can ill afford to make unforced errors. Norris is very self-critical as a driver and lacking confidence in the car will not be helping him so this decent run in Jeddah will help, but the British driver very much needs some clean and preferably victorious races to reassert himself.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Piastri, however, in Jeddah as he has repeatedly this season, made the task look seamless even while navigating the unforgiving circuit which punishes errors with finality.

As a team we made too many mistakes tonight to have a better result. The version we showed tonight was not good enough.“When you play Barcelona, you just need to be brave on the ball, being able to hold the ball under pressure, and being able also in the physical aspects to win your duels, and just sometimes in your football brain to be smarter, to anticipate things. I think we played with too many reactions, instead of being proactive in the game.”Chelsea are trying to reach the European final for only the second time and could still win a quadruple of major trophies this term in Bompastor’s first season in charge, but they will now need an unlikely looking comeback and the performance of their lives if they are to have any chance of overturning this deficit in London.The scoreline could have been worse for Chelsea but for Hannah Hampton’s early penalty save, at a time when the tie was level at 0-0, when the former Ballon d’Or winner Alexia Putellas was denied from the spot. That kept the home side at bay but not for long, with Putellas classily slipping a through ball into the path of Ewa Pajor for the Poland striker to open the scoring.Chelsea improved defensively after the break but were undone by a masterful team goal as Barcelona made it 2-0 with a move that involved 18 passes before Clàudia Pina turned in from inside the six-yard box. Pina herself had played the 13th pass of Barcelona’s flowing move from deep inside her own half before sprinting upfield to turn home the cross.View image in fullscreenChelsea’s Keira Walsh and Sjoeke Nüsken show their disappointment after Barcelona’s fourth goal.Photograph: Albert Gea/ReutersSandy Baltimore’s crisp strike into the far corner with 16 minutes remaining offered Bompastor’s team a glimmer of hope to bring the scoreline back to 2-1, but a far-post header from an unmarked Irene Paredes restored Barcelona’s two-goal advantage soon after.

A shot by Graham Hansen was deflected wide, after the hosts’ holding midfielder Patricia Guijarro had seen a low effort deflected into the arms of Hampton, while Chelsea struggled to hold on to the ball long enough to mount many meaningful attacks in the opening exchanges.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Putellas opted to send her strike straight down the middle and the England goalkeeper Hampton, who had dived slightly to Putellas’s right, made the save comfortably with her feet.That proved to be one of the only moments of celebration for the travelling Chelsea fans and ultimately this was a game which highlighted Barcelona’s superior skill as they appear to be on course to knock Chelsea out at the semi-final stage of this competition for the third successive season.Bompastor refused to concede the tie, though, trying to hold on to some hope for a return-leg comeback: “It will be difficult but, in football, you need to believe. We want to go into the second leg trying to win the game and, in football, anything can happen.” The defender Lucy Bronze told TNT Sports: “I think we can do it.”Barcelona are aiming to reach their fifth consecutive final and lift the European title for the fourth time in those five seasons, having started their current run of dominance in this competition with a 4-0 win against Chelsea – who have never won this title – in the 2021 final in Gothenburg, Sweden.This first-leg meeting was similarly one-sided to that showdown four years ago. But Paredes was urging caution when telling the Catalan television channel TV3: “It’s not done. We are happy with how we played, but we have to go there [Stamford Bridge] and play well as well.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueBarcelona WomenChelsea WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They will be – of that there is only mathematical but virtually no practical doubt. For now, though, the title remains unclaimed for a little while longer.Similarly, Ipswich are not yet relegated, but – as acknowledged by Kieran McKenna even before this defeat – their football will be played in the Championship next season. An implausible five wins to see out the season would likely still send them down on goal difference. If this match marked the reading of their last rites in the top flight, they appeared to hear them in a stupor.By the time Davis was shown a straight red card for a tackle that possessed an abundant capacity to injure but no hope of winning the ball, his side were two goals down and staring at a task that appeared near impossible. His dismissal, with almost an hour remaining, confirmed as much.Saka continued after receiving treatment, but an ice pack was strapped to his ankle upon his substitution in the second half. Arteta played down any lasting damage: “He was a bit sore, but it’s nothing serious, so it’s good. He cuts him from the back. I don’t think it’s intentional at all, but it’s dangerous because he cannot really react to anything, because you cannot see him coming.”The match ceased to exist as anything even resembling a contest following Davis’s departure, although Arsenal’s dominance had been abundantly clear from kick-off, jogging and sometimes walking their way into a healthy lead.Both early goals followed a similar script, emerging from a right side where Ben White, Martin Ødegaard and Saka started together for the first time since November.Saka, in particular, caused all manner of problems. His first cutback went via Ødegaard’s toe to Leandro Trossard who, loitering near the penalty spot, prodded past Alex Palmer while falling backwards. When Saka repeated the trick soon after, Mikel Merino’s backheel sent the ball towards Gabriel Martinelli who was able to tap into an empty net at the far post.View image in fullscreenArsenal’s Gabriel Martinelli scores their second goal after a clever backheel by Mikel Merino.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersThat Saka was credited with neither assist did nothing to deny his role as creator of both. The England forward instantly became the home fans’ primary target following Davis’s sending off, although they would have been hard pressed to challenge the decision with the benefit of replays. They did, at least, gain a modicum of perverse pleasure from his inability to add his name to the scoresheet despite multiple efforts.“I probably thought at the start it was the highest standard we’d faced this year,” McKenna said of Arsenal’s first-half performance. “The red card makes it an impossible task in terms of getting back into the game.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWith one eye on the upcoming PSG semi‑final – Thomas Partey is suspended for the first game – Arteta had decided to use this as a practice for his likely setup, deploying Declan Rice in a deeper No 6 role and pulling Merino back into his more familiar midfield position. Aside from a couple of early skirmishes, where he stood up resolutely to the tricky figure of Julio Enciso, Rice may as well have not been there for all that he was troubled.The absence of any jeopardy allowed Arteta to rotate his troops after the break, with Saka, Merino, Rice and Martinelli all able to put their feet up early.From the ninth minute to the 56th, Ipswich did not even muster a shot, McKenna forced to revert to a 5-3-1 formation in the second half in a bid to prevent the floodgates from opening. It had some success, although Arsenal – exhibiting their set-piece prowess – added two more from short corners.First, Trossard strolled unaccompanied to the edge of the six-yard box before swivelling on the ball and drilling low past Palmer. Then, Ethan Nwaneri cut inside and his shot took multiple deflections on its way into the net. It was nothing that their dominance did not deserve, and Arteta’s side is now unbeaten in 11 matches across all competitions.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“We are really happy; really happy with the performance,” Arteta said. “I think the first 35 minutes is one of the best we played this season.”Ipswich fans have now endured seven successive home defeats, the club’s longest losing run at Portman Road.

Williams said his eyes had “completely gone” after defeat by Ding Junhui in the Players’ Championship in March, and he is understood to be considering surgery.The 21-year-old Wu, one of the audacious stars of China’s latest generation of cueists, had gripped on to Williams’ coattails after resuming 5-4 behind on Sunday, and when the younger man nudged in front in the 15th frame the momentum appeared to have shifted in his favour. Instead a lapse in concentration in the 16th frame cost him dear, Williams using all his guile to pull level before brilliantly crafted breaks of 58 and 75 got him over the line.“Some of the balls he can pot is incredible and he’s got the ability to win this tournament, no question,” Williams said of Wu afterwards. “But I got stronger towards the end and if I can’t outscore or outpot him, I suppose I can outwit him.”Chris Wakelin withstood a stirring comeback from Neil Robertson to beat the Australian former champion 10-8 and seal his place in the second round for the first time. The 33-year-old from Rugby, who had not won a match at the famous venue in three previous attempts, resumed with a 7-2 lead but was rooted in his seat as Robertson reeled off five frames on the bounce to haul the match back level.However, Wakelin recovered his form at the right time, twice poking his nose back in front before riding his luck to clinch a dramatic 18th frame and finally confirm his place in the last 16.Also in a drama-filled evening session, 11th seed Barry Hawkins surrendered a slender overnight advantage to Iranian qualifier Hossein Vafaei, whose pressure-filled break of 73 in the decider sealed a 10-9 win and a second round meeting with Williams.View image in fullscreenXiao Guodong completed a 10-4 victory over qualifier Matthew Selt on Sunday.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PAMark Allen dug deep to chisel out a 5-4 overnight advantage against China’s world No 46 Fan Zhengyi.

Hoban was for many years the UK record holder for stage wins in the Tour de France with a tally of eight during his 17-year professional racing career, a total bettered only by the greatest sprinter of them all, Mark Cavendish, in 2009.Hoban’s first stage victory in the Tour, in 1967, was not one he cared to remember – or that he felt was really a win – as it came the day after the sudden death of his friend and rival Tom Simpson on Mont Ventoux; he was “permitted” to escape and cross the line first by the grieving peloton.It emerged during research for Put Me Back on My Bike, my account of Simpson’s death, that Hoban was probably not the senior riders’ preferred choice on that emotionally charged day, creating an undercurrent of controversy that persisted for a quarter of a century.Nonetheless, his close connection with Major Tom could never be in doubt; the pair had frequently crossed swords as amateurs and Hoban was eventually to marry Simpson’s widow Helen, with whom he moved to the Welsh hills near Newtown, Powys after many years spent in the Flemish city of Gent.Twelve months after Simpson’s death, however, there was no argument about a solo “medium mountain” stage victory in the Alps at Sallanches which Hoban took in magnificently clear-headed style – winning a cow named Estelle – and he added back-to-back stage wins at Bordeaux and Brive in 1969; Cavendish and Geraint Thomas remain the only other Britons to have taken two Tour stages in two days.Hoban added further stage wins at Argèles-sur-Mer and Versailles in 1973, Montpellier in 1974 and Bordeaux in 1975, by which time he was on the way to completing nine Tours; he would finish two more, a record bettered only by Thomas last July.View image in fullscreenBarry Hoban in action during the 1968 Tour de France.Photograph: Agence France Presse/AFP/Getty ImagesAs well as his undoubted sprint skills – which brought him a brace of stage wins in the Vuelta a España in successive days in his first professional season, 1964 – Hoban’s clear head, ability to read a race and his encyclopaedic memory for race routes enabled him to race strongly in one-day Classics.He won the Grand Prix of Frankfurt in 1966, and Gent-Wevelgem in 1974 ahead of Eddy Merckx and Roger De Vlaeminck, the only British victory in the race’s history; his third place in Paris-Roubaix in 1972 was a British best, matched only by Roger Hammond in 2004, while his third in Liège-Bastogne-Liège in 1969 has yet to be bettered by a Briton.“The Grey Fox”, as he was known later in his career, began racing in Yorkshire for the Calder Clarion cycling club, before heading to northern France to race as an independent in 1962. He earned a contract with Raymond Poulidor’s Mercier‑Hutchinson team in 1964 after winning 35 races in the lower tier of the sport, and stayed with the squad in its various incarnations until 1979 apart from a brief spell at Sonolor-Lejeune. In 1980, he retired to Newtown to head up the Coventry-Eagle cycle company; later he worked for the cycle importer Yellow.“He had incredible knowledge of a race,” said a Mercier insider, Guy Caput. “He was far more than a sprinter. His judgment on everything that went on in a race could be relied on absolutely. He was a professional from sunrise to sunset.”Hoban leaves his widow Helen, their daughter Daniella and his stepdaughters Jane and Joanne.Explore more on these topicsCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

The sun shone, the pitch was hard and fast and the free-scoring Bears welcomed back the inspirational wing, Gabriel Ibitoye, after a four-month injury absence.In reality what materialised was a largely dominantLeicestervictory that took them past their opponents into second, on points difference, with four games remaining. Michael Cheika’s one-year assignment as Tigers coach will soon be over but the possibility of him departing a champion cannot be discounted.Gloucester fans ruffle feathers in boisterous start for experimentRead moreLooming over the buildup was the memory of the game last December when Pat Lam’s sidewon 54-24 at Welford Road. The Tigers were hurt by that humiliation, no doubt, but might also have reminded themselves that the Bears were thrashed 38-0 by Sale at home a week later.“For me personally, and for us as a team, we wanted to play this game for the fans,” Cheika said. “We were poor the day they came, and we really wanted to turn that around. I hope they’ll be happy with that performance.”True to form,Bristolseamlessly switched from the sublime to ridiculous here. Adam Radwan’s try had put Leicester in front when Kalaveti Ravouvou made a burst into the visitors’ 22. The Bears centre looked isolated after being dragged down, but the covering defenders could not have imagined the vision and accuracy of a frankly ludicrous one‑handed offload fizzed to Ibitoye, lurking near the touchline. The wing applied a simple finish. “Fiji flair,” Lam said of Ravouvou’s outrageous skill. “With those Fijian boys, just expect the pass. For him to pull it out like that and for Gabs to read it was class.”Quick GuideWomen's Six Nations: Ireland roar back in style to leave Wales winlessShowIreland earned their second Women’s Six Nations win with a 40-14 bonus-point victory over Wales at Rodney Parade. Wales took the lead following a mistake from Ireland wing Amee-Leigh Costigan and the loose ball was quickly scooped up by Carys Cox to ground before Keira Bevan added the extras.The visitors responded when Linda Djougang broke through the Welsh defence to score before another brilliant spell of pressure on the home try line saw Aoife Wafer able to reach over and ground, with Dannah O’Brien converting both tries. Although Ireland were reduced to 14 when O’Brien was sent to the sin-bin, Dorothy Wall added their third try just before the break and Enya Breen’s resulting kick was successful.A dominant afternoon for the visitors continued when a driving maul allowed Wall to cross and secure the bonus point before Djougang weaved through to score underneath the posts, with O’Brien converting.Wales pulled one back through replacement Hannah Bluck, who touched down moments after coming on and Bevan converted, but Wafer extended the visitors’ advantage after breaking from a scrum to score, with Breen’s kick squeezing through the posts to ensure a winless Wales stay bottom.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Soon came the ridiculous. Ibitoye’s ambitious pass drifted into the grateful hands of Ollie Hassell-Collins, near halfway, gifting the wing a clear run to the line. Jack van Poortvliet scored a third try for Leicester and when Handré Pollard added a penalty to two conversions it created a 22-5 half‑time lead for the Tigers. The only downside for them was losing Joe Heyes to the sin-bin for a high shot on Fitz Harding.This being Bristol it felt unlikely that Leicester would serenely close out the win. Ravouvou was duly sent scorching under the posts six minutes after the break and when AJ MacGinty converted the Bears trailed by 10. England’s Ollie Chessum was putting in a huge shift at lock, personifying the old‑fashioned mongrel that Cheika insists on, but Bristol’s attacking potency remained a concern.View image in fullscreenCameron Henderson crosses the line for Leicester’s final try of their victory.Photograph: Steven Paston/PAThe basics still had to be done and when the Bears fluffed a lineout on 63 minutes the full-back Freddie Steward applied a classy finish from turnover ball, ghosting easily away from Benjamín Elizalde and securing a Leicester try bonus point. Game over? Not quite. Harry Randall’s sniping effort again made it a 10-point game and Bristol’s offloading excellence continued to ask questions of the tiring Tigers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Randall had knocked on. A converted try then would have reduced Bristol’s arrears to three with a couple of minutes remaining. It wasn’t to be: Cameron Henderson smashed over for a fifth Leicester try, converted by Jamie Shillcock with the final kick.Considering Bristol’s tricky run‑in – Northampton and Sale away, Bath and Harlequins at home – if they don’t improve on this performance their season could go south quickly.“We were just messy,” said Lam, who pointed to Bristol’s injury issues, particularly in the second row. “We’ve got to dust ourselves off, with a six-day turnaround, and go and get some points at Northampton next Saturday. Everyone’s pretty gutted … but if we can get five [points] next week it makes a big difference.”Chessum said: “We owed it firstly to people back home, after what happened,” referring to that painful thrashing last December. “But we owed it to ourselves, too.” Does he like the idea of a trip to Australia with the British & Irish Lions this summer? “No comment.” Another tight spot successfully negotiated.Explore more on these topicsPremiershipBristolLeicesterRugby unionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But in the US’s new age of irrationalism and chaos, these two men are now of one voice, pursuing a strand of Trumpist politics that sometimes feels strangely overlooked. With Trump once again in the White House and Kennedy ensconced as his health and human services secretary, what they are jointly leading is becoming clearer by the day: a war on science and knowledge that aims to replace them with the modern superstitions of conspiracy theory.Nearly 2,000 members of the US’s National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicinehave warnedof “slashing funding for scientific agencies, terminating grants to scientists, defunding their laboratories, and hampering international scientific collaboration”. Even work on cancer isnow under threat. But if you want to really understand the Trump regime’s monstrousness, consider whereKennedy and a gang of acolytesare heading on an issue that goes to the heart of millions of lives: autism.Last Wednesday,Kennedy spokeat a press conference staged in response to a report about apparently rising rates of autism published by the US’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And out it all came: an insistence that autism is an “epidemic” and a “preventable disease”, and – in complete defiance of the science – that the root cause lies with “environmental toxins”. A range of new studies, he said, will begin reporting back in September: with the same banality that defines his boss’s promises on international conflict and global economics, he told his audience that answers would be presented to the public “very, very quickly”.Most of the people present would have been aware ofKennedy’s past supportfor the thoroughly discredited idea that autism is somehow linked to the use of vaccines. As he spoke, they were presumably reminded of the occasions when he has talked about autistic people with a mixture of disgust and complete ignorance. Autism, he said, “destroys” families; today’s autistic children “will never pay taxes. They’ll never hold a job. They’ll never play baseball. They’ll never write a poem. They’ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.” Those comments have rightly triggered a huge backlash. But what has been rather lacking is a broader critique of Kennedy’s ideas, and how they go deep into aspects of the US’s culture and politics.As I explain inthe book I have just writtenabout my autistic son, James, I began my immersion in autism and the arguments that swirl around it 15 years ago, when he received his diagnosis from the NHS. That came amid visits from speech therapists and educational psychologists, and increasingly futile appointments with a paediatrician, who in effect told us to go away and manage as best we could. But straight away, I was also aware of a much more exotic subculture rooted in the US, based around the idea that autism could somehow be cured, and an array of regimens and pseudo-treatments.1:00'I asked you a simple question, Bobby': Sanders grills RFK Jr on vaccines and autism – videoThe anxieties surrounding Andrew Wakefield’s disgraced work on a link between autism and the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab were still easy to pick up. I read about “chelation”: injecting chemicals into the bloodstream, supposedly to remove the toxic preservatives used in vaccines from the body and send autism on its way. It was easy to find stuff about impossibly restrictive diets, and the terrifying notion offorcing people to drink diluted bleach. These ideas, moreover, came with claims of endless government cover-ups: proto-Maga stuff, which had long been snowballing online.That said, the underlying logic of all this quackery was encouraged by much more mainstream voices. By and large, British campaigning and research tends to focus on what autism actually is, and how to make autistic lives better – whereas in the US, very powerful forces have seen autism as a disease. In 2006, President George W Bush signed a legislative package tellingly called theCombating Autism Act, hailed by one of its supporters as “a federal declaration of waron theepidemic of autism”. At that point, there were initiatives and organisations with names such as Cure Autism Now and Defeat Autism Now! All this had already spawned the autistic self-advocacy movement that continues to loudly contest such ideas, but its appeal obviously still lingers.If I were in the US, I would now have two big worries. As well as constant attacks on the public sector that have alreadyhacked back helpfor autistic people, there is a huge question about what Kennedy’s nonsense might mean for other areas of federal government policy, and the kind of MMR-style panics his “answers” on toxins might trigger. But some of those concerns also apply to the UK, thanks to the ease with which ideas travel, and how Trump and his allies influence politics across the world.Kennedy’s pronouncements are not only about what causes autism; they also reflect an age-old perception of autism as an aberration, and many autistic people as “ineducable” and beyond help. This surely blurs into populists’ loathing of modern ideas about human difference: once you have declared war on diversity, an attack on the idea of neurodiversity will not be far away. It also chimes with one of the new right’s most pernicious elements: its constant insistence that everything is actually much simpler than it looks.RFK Jr contradicts experts by linking autism rise to ‘environmental toxins’Read moreWhich brings me to something it feels painful to have to write. Autism denotes a fantastically complicated set of human traits and qualities, but that does not make them any less real. It presents with and without learning disabilities, and can be synonymous with skills and talents. Its causes (if that is even the right word) are largely genetic, althoughcareful researchis focused on how those heritable aspects might sometimes –sometimes– intersect with factors during pregnancy, and with parental age. And obviously, those characterisations barely scratch the surface, which is some indication of the absurdity of Kennedy’s position, and how dangerous it is.On this side of the Atlantic, there are very good reasons why many of us who have families with autistic members feel deep anxiety about the constant shunting of politics to the right. The care, education and official understanding of the people we love and sometimes look after is fragile enough already: what would happen if their fate was in the hands of the Trumpist know-nothings of Reform UK, or Alternative für Deutschland? The American tragedy unfolding in front of our eyes shows the future we now have to avoid, and the kind of people we may have to fight, who will not just be arrogant and inhumane, but set on taking us back to a failed past: terrible human beings, you might call them.John Harris is a Guardian columnist.

Thank goodness the government has seen sense on thisRhiannon Lucy CosslettA ‘Romeo and Juliet’ clause in England’s crime bill is common sense – now let’s focus on the men who really harm young girlsSun 20 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Apr 2025 09.12 EDTShareGod, remember kissing in corridors? It’s been so long since I was a teenager that I had honestly forgotten how much snogging used to happen at school, until it was mentioned in the House of Commons this week. (I have never been a fan of the word snogging, yet as a term it’s powerfully evocative of late 1990s-early 2000s adolescence, conjuring a heady mix of Impulse body spray and Lynx Africa, the taste of Juicy Fruit chewing gum, and the sound of braces clashing.)Teenage love is in the headlines, because of the news that there will be a“Romeo and Juliet” exemptionto the new crime and policing bill obliging professionals in England, including teachers and healthcare workers, to report suspicions of child sexual abuse. The exemption for teenagers in consensual sexual relationships received cross-party support, recognising that “not all sexual activity involving under-18s is a cause for alarm or state intervention”.This is all common sense, andsimilar approachesare already in place in countries such as Australia and France. That teenagers engage in sexual activity should be news to no one – obliging teachers to report every instance as a potential child sexual offence will give them an even higher workload than they face already. Instead, they can use their professional judgment. Safeguards remain in place: if there is any indication of harm or imbalance, the duty to report remains.It confirms what many of us have long known: that often the most present threat to teenage girls are those older guys who just can’t seem to get a girlfriend their own age. You know the kind. The groomers. Guys who are 19, 20, older, who hang around the school gates in their Saxos and Corsas. In my home town, one actually went on the run with – or arguably abducted – a just turned 13-year-old girl. Others would invite underage girls to their shitty flats and ply them with alcohol. Alongside these men you had the even older ones in positions of power – at my own school, the biggest threat to teen girls was ouractual headteacher(Neil Foden was eventually convicted of multiple offences).It would be utterly absurd to put such criminal abuse and exploitation on a par with teenage fumbling. The use of Romeo and Juliet to describe the clause may at first seem rather grandiose, but isn’t that just how love, or at least lust, feels at that age? Intense, powerful, tragic even. That feeling of “If I can’t kiss him right this very second against the science block stairs, then I might as well drink poison”. I suspect its resonance is the reason it’s on the syllabus for pupils just about coming up to Juliet’s age (13). It also provides a framework for discussing these issues in class (“I know you feel like the main character in your own Shakespearean tragedy right now, but maybe put down the deadly nightshade and listen to someLana Del Reyinstead?”)I remember how Amy, who sat next to me in English, could recite most of the play by heart. “O brawling love! O loving hate!” – I can still hear her voice now. That Romeo is saying these words about Rosaline, before he abruptly switches his affection to Juliet, was lost on us. It was in vain that our English teacher tried to get us to think about how Shakespeare might have been commenting on the fickleness of young love. There’s no telling you when you’re in the middle of it, is there? Yet there’s an argument that we should taketeenagers’ romantic feelings more seriously, because they can go on to shape us.Today’s teens are lucky, in many ways. They are not experiencing their first love, or lust, against a backdrop of alarming teenage pregnancy rates, as we were. They receive better sex education, at an earlier age, have access to more variedmethods of contraception, and aregenerally more clued up about the biology of reproduction. We certainly weren’t making TikToks about the luteal phase – we didn’t even know what it meant, let alone how it might affect your dating behaviour.One thing hasn’t changed, though, and that’s howvulnerable teenagers are, and how easily their hearts can be broken. We thought we were so grown up when we were fooling around at 15, going on dates to Pizza Hut, dissecting our relationships on MSN and rolling ridiculous 10-skin joints so we could hotbox caravans. We were just kids, like the teens I see walking to school or on the bus now, so impossibly young and naive, but fizzing with hormones that made you want to jump each other.While jumping each other on a Tuesday morning outside set two maths isn’t often going to be a reportable offence, anyone who works with young people knows that their vulnerable hearts need some sort of safeguarding, too. Perhaps, alongside all the work that needs to be done in terms of consent and online misogyny and how to recognise abusive relationships, we all need formal lessons in heartbreak – after all, these years can shape our adult relationships to come and who we are. I wonder about the role they play in later infidelities, too. Most of us are happy to leave those Impulse-scented years behind us, but we all know someone who will always chase that Juicy Fruit high.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and authorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That’s all we wantedSonia SodhaLast week’s ruling clarified the legal safeguards of the Equality Act. However, it was a travesty that the battle needed to be fought at allSun 20 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Apr 2025 03.19 EDTShareMiddle-aged women are expected to fade into the background, to be apologetic for their existence, to quietly accept their lot. They’re not supposed to stick up for themselves, to enforce their boundaries, to say no. As a woman, these societal expectations have been drummed into me from day one. But still. The swell of anger and disgust that rose in response to thesupreme court judgmentlast week that made clear women’s rights are not for dismantling – rights already won, that were supposed to be ours all along – has taken my breath away.I was in court last Wednesday to hear Lord Hodge confirm that the Equality Act’s legal protections that were always intended for women are, indeed, reserved for women. He reiterated that trans people continue to have the same robust legal protections against discrimination and harassment as any other protected group, something I’ve always emphasised in my own writing. But men who identify as female – whether or not they have a legal certificate – are not to be treated as though female for the purposes of equalities law.This is a hugely consequential clarification because for the past 10 years lobby groupssuch as Stonewallhave misrepresented the law, telling public sector organisations, charities and companies that they must treat trans women as women.Now the supreme courthas made it clear: female-only services, spaces and sports cannot admit males, however they identify. Workplaces and schools must offer single-sex facilities; service providers do not always have to, though it may be unlawful sex discrimination for them not to do so.This means it is never lawful to expect a female nurse to share changing facilities with a male colleague. It’s not lawful to tell a distressed female patient that the obviously male patient next to her in the female-only ward is, in fact, a woman and she is transphobic to question it. It’s not lawful to expect a female rape victim to take or leave a female-only support group that includes men. It’s not lawful to tell a woman required to undergo a strip-search that the male police officer doing it is actually female. It’s not lawful to expect teenage girls to play women’s football on a team with male players, or female boxers to box against men. Lesbians can have their own groups and associations without being bullied into admitting straight male members who – in an act of gross homophobia – self-identify as “lesbian”.Why does this matter? Because this unlawful activity has all been happening in recent years, to the detriment not just of women’s safety, but our privacy and dignity. The judgment could not be clearer on the above, though that has not stopped a former supreme court justice,Jonathan Sumption, and a former cabinet minister,Harriet Harman, from taking to the airwaves to interpret the law incorrectly.Can you imagine angry leftwing men railing against any other group that’s managed to secure their rights? Me neitherIn his remarks, Hodge cautioned against readingthe judgmentas a triumph of one group over another. That is entirely correct: the Equality Act balances conflicting rights, and the supreme court has simply restored the balance to where the law said it was supposed to be. Trans people have their protections, but now women’s protections, too, have been clearly ringfenced on the same basis – all that leftwing feminists ever asked for.But many pundits have misinterpreted this as meaning women should not celebrate a landmark legal victory in a case it was a travesty they ever had to fight. It’s a product of the rank misogyny embedded everywhere, from right to left. Can you imagine angry leftwing men railing against any other group that’s managed to secure their rights? Chastising them for not being gracious enough in victory? Me neither. The reaction to the judgment serves as an important reminder that, while the law is the law, our culture remains dead-set against women who say no to men. It’s how women’s and lesbians’ rights were so rapidly eroded by Stonewall and its allies in the first place, and why women have been bullied, hounded and sacked simply for trying to assert their legal protections.The same people are ignoring the supreme court’s emphasis that none of this takes away from trans people’s existing rights, and are scaremongering and infantilising trans people as victims. Lloyds Bank wrote to all its employees to say it “stood by” and “cherished”all its trans employees. Several unions have organised an emergency demo in support of trans rights, giving the impression they are beingrolled back. It’s easy to forget that all that has happened is that the supreme court has been clear that a male desire for validation does not trump women’s rights to single-sex spaces and services. That if you are a male police officer or nurse demanding to strip-search or carry out a smear test on a woman, the answer is no. Part of being a grownup is understanding that the world cannot always be structured around your own wants and needs. It’s not kind, compassionate or healthy to indulge a failure to accept that.The judgment means trans rights activists are at a crossroads. Do they double down and try to argue that MPs must respond by dismantling women’s legal protections? Or do they put a stop to an ideological crusade that’s harmed not just women and lesbians, but the many trans people who aren’t dogmatic about gender ideology, and instead advocate for gender-neutral third spaces, open and female categories in sports, and specialist services for trans people, and against discrimination based on gender non-conformity? If they pick the latter path, they’ll find willing allies in women like me.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Brother Nigel has popped up on the government’s left flankby demanding the immediate nationalisationof the steel industry. He’s also expressed a solidarity with trades unionists hitherto undetected in this longtime admirer of Margaret Thatcher.At an event at a working men’s club in one of the more deprived wards of County Durham, theold fraud even claimedto have a personal affinity with steelworkers because he used to be in the “metals business” himself. This was a disingenuous reference to his time as a trader at the London Metal Exchange, which involved long lunches in the City fuelled with copious quantities of port. Or maybe he was thinking of his gig as a paid “brand ambassador” for a firm that deals in gold bullion.Many descriptions come to mind when contemplating the leader of Reform UK, but I’m finding it a stretch of the mental elastic to get to working-class hero. Maybe he’s forgottenhis recent voteagainst outlawing fire-and-rehire and his party’s opposition to banning zero-hours contracts.So what is going on here? With his trademark malevolent grin, he told us exactly what he is up to during an attention-seeking swing through Labour heartlands in the north of England where Reform is hoping to make hefty gains in the local elections. He cackled about “parking their tankson the lawns of the red wall”, a phrase he’s used before, but not previously with quite such an intensity of intent. The plan makes sense. If he is to advance on his stated ambition to be the next prime minister, it won’t be sufficient to get the better of the Tories in the scrap between the two of them for traditionally rightwing voters. He’s also going to need to garner support from at least some of the voters who backed Labour last July.The local elections on 1 May will be a first test of whether this strategy has viability. The outcome of these contests are awaited eagerly by Reform, nervily by Labour people anticipating a difficult night, and even more fretfully by the Tories, who are expecting an absolutely diabolical one. Kemi Badenoch is so desperate to depress expectations that she’s warned her party thatit could lose“almost every single one” of the more than 900 wards being defended by the Conservatives. Sir Keir Starmer’s party has many fewer seats to lose, but much to fear if there’s evidence that Farageism has the potential to wreck Labour at the next general election as grievously as it hurt the Conservatives at last year’s one.Reform is a vehicle for the angry to express their discontent with the quality of their lives and local areasWith both an unpopular government and a floundering official opposition to go at, this is fertile territory for Reform, and the more so becausepolls suggestits vote share is up about 10 points since the general election. That said, the path towards polling day has been rocky for Reform’s leader. The fat cheque once rumoured to be on its way fromhis erstwhile “hero”Elon Musk has never materialised. The billionaire has since said Mr Farage “doesn’t have what it takes” and transferred his benedictions to Rupert Lowe, the MP for Great Yarmouth who is now sitting as an independent as a result of a ferociously ugly falling out between him and Mr Farage. Mr Lowe, a wealthy fellow with deep pockets, has just announced that he isgoing to suefor defamation because of allegations made about him by the Reform leader and his acolytes.The bromance with Donald Trump has been much vaunted, mainly by Mr Farage himself. That looks to be even more of an electoral liability since the US president ignited the trade war that has unleashed mayhem on global markets. Nige made like a submarine for a while. When he finally surfaced to break his radio silence, he wasforced to admitthat his buddy in the White House might have blundered just a little bit, putting it down to doing “too much too soon”.Many Labour people used to be rather complacent about Reform, thinking it to be mainly a menace to the Tories. Now Morgan McSweeney and other Labour strategists are treating it as a serious threat. Sir Keir has been taking the gloves off by calling the Reform leader a danger to the NHS and attacking him forpast fawningover Vladimir Putin. Then there is Mr Farage’s unfortunate habit of attracting the repulsive to his ranks. For all his boasts that the party has become much stricter in vetting the characters it allows to be its candidates, a string of them havehad to be ditchedfor making comments so repellent that even Mr Farage couldn’t dismiss them as banter.Disowned candidates, being a Trump tribute act and internecine warfare. That’s a cocktail you might expect to be toxic to a party’s popularity if the normal rules applied. But it doesn’t seem to be off-putting to Reform supporters. His well-honed talent is for exploiting grievance, and there’s a lot of that about. As Ukip and the Brexit party were before it, Reform is a vehicle for the angry to express their discontent with the quality of their lives and local areas, and to vent their animosity towards Tory and Labour parties that Reform’s leader is adept at painting as two failed faces of a dismal status quo. The tactics are ruthless, but the policies are vacant. He’spromising votersthat Reform mayors and councillors will implement a Musk-inspired “British form of Doge” to purge alleged inefficiencies and excesses in council spending, with diversity and equality programmes predictably topping the hitlist. The chainsaw may be coming to your city, county or town hall. Burning it all down Musk-style will not solve, it will deepen, the problems in the areas that Reform is targeting.The party’s national prospectus is no more plausible. He claims he’ll slash taxes, but starts waffling whenever asked how he would pay for it. Unfunded tax cuts are from the Liz Truss school of fiscal responsibility and economic management. None of which is likely to matter much on 1 May because for those attracted to Farageism, it is not, and never has been, about its credibility as a programme for government. He provides a spittoon for the angry voter to gob their fury into.The poison between him and Mr Lowe suppurated into public view when the other man madea mocking referenceto Reform being a “protest party led by the Messiah”. I’m not with him on the Messiah bit, but the first half is correct. It is precisely because Reform is a protest party that itought to do extremely wellat these elections. Polling suggests that big majorities of voters in the North and the Midlands agree that “Britain is broken” and heading in the wrong direction. For those who feel they were betrayed by the Tories and are now being let down by Labour, Reform offers a boot with which to inflict a kick in the ballots on both the older parties.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reform hopes to replicate the Lib Dems’ successful model of building a substantial base of councillors and using them as beachheads to go on to capture parliamentary seats in the same localities.He’s predicting a “turquoise wave” across the North and Midlands. Polling suggests Reform won’t just gain councillors, but also councils and possibly bag a mayoralty in Lincolnshire and another in East Yorkshire. The Runcorn and Helsby byelection, also on May day,ought to be winnableif Reform has as much momentum as Mr Farage claims. On paper, the Cheshire seat is the 16th safest in Labour’s possession, but the concept of “safe” seats has much less relevance these days when the political landscape is so volatile and fragmented. The circumstances that triggered this byelection – the former Labour MPassaulting a constituent– also work in Reform’s favour.Whatever he may claim, a victorious night for Nigel Farage won’t mean that he is marching on Downing Street. It will mean deeper existential angst in the ranks of the Conservative party and elevated anxiety among Labour people that they haven’t found an answer to the seething mass of grievances that he so cunningly and cynically exploits.Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the ObserverExplore more on these topicsOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Surely doomsday is nighSun 20 Apr 2025 05.01 EDTShareAgroup of six women returned to Earth from space on Monday, including Katy Perry, the former wife of the Trump cheerleader Russell Brand; and the former Fox news presenter and philanthropist Lauren Sánchez, fiancee of Donald Trump’s media lapdog Jeff Bezos, who bentWashington Posteditorial policy to favour the New American Fascism ™ ®. It’s a shame they didn’t fly straight into the heart of the sun.The six compliant women were sent to space as a costly PR exercise for Bezos’s commercial space flight ambitions, although Perry said it was actually about “finding the love for yourself” and “feeling that divine feminine”. Tell that to all the women worldwide whom Bezos’s pal Trump’s policies are penalising. Singing idiot.Katy Perrysaid she kissed a girl and she liked it. As Trump rolls back on LGBTQ+ rights I’m surprised the Trump-adjacent Bezos allowed a bi-curious woman into space. I suppose discussions of sexual identity don’t matter if they’re mere titillation. And if Perry is bisexual, she is at least less likely to influence vulnerable young people while orbiting the Earth.Sánchez, meanwhile, is vice-chairman of Bezos’s Bezos Earth Fund, an environmental group thatended its fundingof decarbonisation initiatives in February, in line with Bezos’s support of Trump, who denies climate change while simultaneously seeing that a defrosting Greenland offers superb mineral mining opportunities. Why are all these wankers so totally and unashamedly full of shit?So I have come to Cornwall for a week, but still I can’t escape the news. As I drove the Penwith peninsula in search of sacred underground Cornish fogous to decompress in, the dead car radio suddenly found a frequency to tell me Perry had sadly survived her Bezos-boosting spaceflight. If those women really cared about the future of the planet they’d have sabotaged themselves to discredit Trump’s big tech donor, but they selfishly chose not to. History will be their judge.Ostensibly I’m here to see the Tate St Ives exhibition of the mighty 20th-century surrealistIthell Colquhoun, whose greatest works were inspired by the landscapes of Cornwall, and who died in its loving arms in 1988. Like the late standup comedian Jethro, Colquhoun is indivisible from the land that nurtured her talent, and both created works called This Train Don’t Stop Camborne Wednesdays, though only one features an impressionistic portrayal of the vulva as twin columns of flame.I’m the Ralph McTell of champagne socialist satire. Let me take you by the hand.Thirty years ago I’d pick up Colquhoun’s signed books, their value unacknowledged by vendors, in secondhand shops and wonder at her obscurity. But tides turn, and now she is venerated, 47 years from her passing. Maybe one day I may yet help Bloomsbury’s Museum of Comedy stage that long mooted Jethro retrospective? But first, I have to file my finalObservercolumn.My sister asks why I am not appearing at Norwich Theatre Royal, and so do I, as my tour shows always sell it out, sometimes twice over. I begin rambling about “visibility”, and how a whole generation of us, as printed news and trustworthy current affairs television began to wither, came to rely on social media to bob us along on its churning sewage-strewn surface. Then Trump’s tech bros skewed the algorithms away from liberal content and, in Google’s case, even agreed to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to appease him. History is mutable, it seems.I can feel people glazing over as I explain this. What does the end of verifiable information matter to them? After all,The White Lotuswas fine, despite the flawed final episode, and that’s enough surely? And all politicians are as bad as one another anyway. And I realise I sound like that American bloke on acid at a Butthole Surfers gig in 1988 saying The Man is controlling our minds with miniature ear robots and hidden smells. But this time around, all those stoned paranoid imaginings are finally true!We put our futures, and it seems the future of facts themselves, in the hands of bent balding billionaires, still nursing a grudge against the kids from their high school who played guitar or drew cool comics. The Trump administration, accommodated by the likes of Keir Starmer and Katy Perry, is the geopolitical equivalent of a football player stuffing the face of the boy who won the spelling competition into the toilet bowl. For ever.Here’s where we, and random Venezuelans with random tattoos, start paying. Sometimes, I think one routine I wrote about immigration sometime in the early 00s was shared by socials so often it basically gave me a career, culminating in theTimescalling me the world’s greatest living standup comedian by osmosis. I’m the Ralph McTell of champagne socialist satire. Let me take you by the hand.But now everything has changed. Campaigns, comedians, critics, charities, writing careers and worthy causes that gained traction in the tiny toilet window between the downturn in print media and the twin horrors of Musk’s annexation of Twitter and Google’s apparent abandonment of its “Don’t Be Evil” mantra would never flourish today. We give birth astride the grave. The light gleams an instant as Twitter helps Tracey Thorn from Everything But the Girl become a bestselling author. Then it’s night once more.I think someone needs to build a new global news network, disinvested from media money men and Trump knee-benders, to save objective truth as we know it. Maybe Andrew Neil could do it, using the skills he learned from kickstarting GB News?

But is bending the truth always a bad thing when looking for love?Sun 20 Apr 2025 09.01 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Apr 2025 16.50 EDTShareIn 1994, I went on a date. I had just arrived in a new country and I liked the guy: he seemed funny and confident. He took me to a hardware store (weird, but not a dealbreaker) and then for a Tex-Mex meal during which, at some point, I told him I drove a Land Rover.It was a truly weird, dumb, lie – I knew nothing about cars and cared even less. Maybe I thought it made me sound grown up, tougher and more capable than I was, or maybe the margaritas went to my head? I’m sure I told him other lies (I remember giving the impression that I enjoyed clubbing), but that one was memorably stupid.I was reminded of it recentlyby a trailerfor Channel 4’s new dating showThe Honesty Box. It’s another reality TV product of the Love Island genus in which attractive, spray-tanned young people lie around in swimwear generating low-stakes drama, but the twist this time is they must not lie, because a “state-of-the-art lie detection system” will probe their true feelings. The trailer sets some archetypes of dating liars to music – the guy with a filtered profile pic and fake age; the couple who claim they are polyamorous but are “actually nowhere near emotionally mature enough to handle that”; the girl whose healthy gym selfies conceal daddy issues “and crabs”! It’s playing on a deep sense of weariness at dating dishonesty, though whether an E4 competition with a £100,000 prize is the best medium to address this is debatable.There is so much obfuscation, omission, embroidery and brazen fibbing around romance. We’ve crafted a whole lexicon of deceit to describe it, from catfishing to gaslighting orroaching(not disclosing you’re seeing other people). In 2024, aUS surveyfound that 21% of respondents had lied about their age on dating profiles; 14% about their income and hobbies and 12% about their height. This seems low (are people even lying in survey responses?), but I suppose telling profile lies –kittenfishing– is the tip of the lie-iceberg; when you’re messaging and meeting up, lies can proliferate. When you realise you like on someone, you could choose to get real with them, but there’s also a danger of doubling down on deceit, since there’s more to lose.This might be me trying to justify my own idiotic fibbing, but is it all, always, awful? Obviously, there are egregious lies: the ones about your relationship status, sexual preferences, wanting kids when you don’t – the stuff that causes real harm. In a jaw-dropping viral 52-episode TikTok saga last year,“Who the fuck did I marry?”, a woman described how the man she met online and married turned out to have lied about work, finances, family and everything else; in its wake,the Cutspoke to five other women who discovered they were dating pathological liars of various stripes.But I think these are – sorry – “outliars”: lesser dating lies are much more common. Many are attempts – however wrongheaded – at kindness or politeness.Researchers at Stanfordnamed them “butler lies”, the kind of face-saving fictions and manufactured excuses your butler might have proffered on your behalf back in the day. Lots more are surely born of insecurity. I suppose there must be people so serenely accepting of their personality, appearance and history that they are comfortable immediately offering their unvarnished selves to potential romantic partners, but they’re surely rarer than white rhinos. Lots of dating lies seem like a sort of wishful thinking, an attempt to be the better selves we assume others want. Is that a million miles away from wearing Spanx, concealer or Cuban heels?Humans lie all the time – of course they do it in this most vulnerable of contexts and maybe sometimes that merits a compassionate blind eye. Easy for me to say, I suppose, after decades off the dating market. DIY-store date guy found out years later. He was baffled – he wouldn’t have cared remotely if I’d told him I was a carless loser – but thankfully, it wasn’t a dealbreaker. If I had faced interrogation from a state-of-the-art lie detector, maybe he wouldn’t be enjoying the dubious privilege of me 30 years later, in all my unlovely truth.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDatingOpinionRelationshipsOnline datingE4Love IslandcommentShareReuse this content"

To do so again after being mauled by the lion? It’s what … ill-advised? Reckless? Suicidal? Six years ago I gave a talk atTed, the world’s leading technology and ideas conference. It led to a gruelling lawsuit and a series of consequences that reverberate through my life to this day.And last week I returned. To giveanothertalk that would incorporate some of my experience: a Ted Talk about being sued for giving a Ted Talk, and how the lessons I’d learned from surviving all that were a model for surviving “broligarchy” – a conceptI first wrote aboutin theObserverin July last year: the alignment of Silicon Valley and autocracy, and a kind of power the world has never seen before. The key point I wanted to get across to this powerful and important audience is that politics is technology now. And technology is politics.But as I wrote several drafts in the week leading up to last week’s talk in Vancouver, Canada, I had what felt like a slow-motion anxiety attack. One insistent question throbbed like toothache:why?Why, after everything that had happened last time, was I putting myself through it all over again?In 2019, my first Ted Talk, entitled “Facebook’s role in Brexit – and the threat to democracy”, sent a shock wave across the conference, then the internet and then my life. I ended up facing a defamation suit over 19 words contained in it, that ate up my time, energy and, as time went on, my sanity.And now here we are. In the first weeks of the second Trump presidency, withElon Muskripping up the US government. The power of the tech titans – the subject I’ve been investigating and reporting and talking about for the past nine years – is now finally front and centre. But now it all feels too late. My warning then – that democracy may not survive technology – was not heeded.I’d be speaking, again, directly toSilicon Valley, to the men – because it is men – who are building the latest most powerful technology yet – AI – the runaway train that is coming for all our lives. Men who, crucially, are now marching in step with Donald Trump, the head of what is increasingly looking likea rogue state.And whatcouldI say? How could I address the collapse of the postwar international order and the role that technology is playing in it in the 10 to 12 minutes I’d been allotted? It was absurd. Most Ted Talks are written and learned months in advance, but I was a late addition to the lineup and the day before I was due to depart I didn’t even have a finished script.I could feel a wave of hostility coming from one small section of the audienceThings reached a head on a Zoom meeting with the two lead curators and the head of Ted, a British media entrepreneur and philanthropist, Chris Anderson, who gently tore apart my latest draft, based on a viral column I’d written for theObserver:How to Survive the Broligarchy, 20 lessons for the post-truth world, a cross between a manifesto and a handbook about what techno-authoritarianism is going to mean for us all.Did I really need a slide of Musk doing what looked like a Nazi salute, asked Anderson, given that Musk had denied it and it would alienate part of the audience from the off.Last time around, Anderson pointed out, I’d managed to take the audience with me as I laid out the story.Last time around, I told him, it felt like the situation was redeemable. In 2019, I thought that “the gods of Silicon Valley”, as I’d described them, could be persuaded to take measures to prevent the harms of their platforms. “But that ship has now sailed.” In 2019, people in Silicon Valley could claim ignorance. Now, the leaders of Silicon Valley companies have made a clear and unmistakable choice.Anderson’s counter was that people who work at these companies, and who would be in the room, “are still the best chance of effecting change”. It was actually bracing to hear his pushback, but when he suggested that perhaps I remove a line about the lawsuit I became tearful.The line was about the importance of defending facts, and for me it was what lay at the heart of the entire case. “It’s just really profound for me,” I said. “It’s what it was all about.”“Look,” he said at the end of the call. “We invited you. It’s up to you to choose what you want to say.” The weight, the freedom, theresponsibilityof that lay on me as I fiddled endlessly with my copy on the long flight across the Atlantic.Two days later I stood on the Ted stage and gavethe opening talkof the conference. It began with an unexpected cheer when I put up a slide that read: “It’s a coup”. We can’t fight it if we can’t see it, I said, and we can’t see it if we can’t name it. I wasn’t expecting the spontaneous response. It hadn’t even seemed controversial to me. (All week, in the days after the talk, people told me what a “release” it had been to have someone say the words out loud. “It hit me somewhere beneath my solar plexus,” a fellow speaker said. “I can’t explain how powerful it was to have someone say that, especially here.”)But as I went on, I became aware of another current in the room. I couldfeel a wave of hostility coming from one small section of the audience. I’d had cheers and whoops but I could also see folded arms, hostile stares. Later, I would meet one of them, a close friend of Musk’s whose husband sat on the board of his companies.“In 2019 I called out the gods of Silicon Valley.Sam Altman, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk,” I said in my closing statement. “I was wrong. You are not gods. You are men and you are careless … You are collaborators. You are complicit in a regime of fear and cruelty.”Walking off stage, I gave a loud involuntary sigh that’s audibleon the film of the talk.I tried.I tried in 2019, and I’ve tried again now. It’s my best effort to communicate why we face such profound risk. And that’s the emotion that’s visible, audible, all the way through the talk. It’s why I put myself back out there.Because what happened to me is now coming for so many other people. Not just weaponised lawsuits against other journalists and online campaigns of harassment and abuse – though thatiscoming – but the everyday surveillance and data harvesting to which we are all subjected. In the new political landscapes, that carries new risks. I’ve been on the sharp end of that. I know how itfeels. Terrifying. But it’s also the business model of Silicon Valley, and it’s why, as individuals, we must take steps to protect ourselves.What I can’t stress enough is how much worse the situation is now, six years on.Most of us – and I include myself here – have no idea how fast this technology is accelerating and how much power we are voluntarily giving up, how exposed and vulnerable we are.Watch Carole Cadwalladr’s 2025 Ted Talk, This Is What a Digital Coup Looks Like.I’m now back home. I did a follow-up interview with Anderson in which he called the talk “an absolute blockbuster”. And it now has a life outside the conference; it’s landed onYouTubewhere it’s gainedalmost 1m views in less than a week.American friends and total strangers have sent me heartfelt notes. And two MPs, one Labour, one Conservative, and two members of the House of Lords have sent me messages about a specific reference I made to the UK government’s proposed bill that isseeking to tear upour 300-year-old copyright laws to make it easier for AI companies to use artists’ intellectual property for training their models. It’s called the data use and access bill and it’s currently working its way through the Commons despite protests fromthousandsof people across the entire UK creative industries, including the likes ofElton John and Paul McCartney.But none of that was a given. I almost didn’t go through with it. I’d been unnerved by a back and forth with Tamsin Allen, a UK libel lawyer, hours before my talk. Ultimately, there was risk attached to me saying even the most seemingly innocuously factual things about the case, because it was me, because it was Ted, because the one lesson I’ve learned the hardest way is that when someone wants to attack you, they will find a way.“Watch her talk from five years ago,” reads one of the thousands of comments on YouTube. “She was much more animated, much more upbeat and bright. Now she looks and sounds completely terrified, dejected, exhausted and heartbroken.”AI is in the hands of a small group of reckless, careless men who seem to have no understanding of societyThe internet we’ve created, captured by big corporations and built on data tracking, was not inevitable. Nor is what’s coming next. And it’s why I wanted to write this piece. Because as hopeless as things are, there’s no inevitability to what comes next. It’s why I’m so appalled at the naivety of the British government, which, at the very moment that it should be seeking to strengthen UK national sovereignty against US tech power, is doing the exact opposite. This is not a partisan issue. David Davis, the Conservative MP, leaves me a voice note telling me that he views “the proposed changes in copyright law somewhere between theft and intellectual slavery”. It is, he says, an inversion of property law.The big difference between Ted of six years ago and Ted in 2025 is AI. It dominates almost every conversation. The scale and pace of advancement in the technology is mind-blowing in the true sense of the word. AI’s domination of Ted is just a snapshot of its domination of every coming aspect of our lives.Watch the interview with Sam Altman at Ted.It’s going to blast away whole industries, concentrate even greater power in an even smaller group of men, deplete the planet’s resources even further, and it’s in the hands of reckless, careless people who seem to have no understanding of society. To them, it’s just a race; a winner-takes-all competition. All while the world still looks much the same – same streets, same houses, same politicians talking on the same TVs. It’s why it’s so hard to get your head around it.In my talk I made a point of criticising Sam Altman, another Ted speaker and the chief executive of OpenAI, the company that rocked the world when it unveiled ChatGPT in 2022. And at the end of last week,Anderson interviewed himlive on stage and put my words directly to him: “In our opening session, Carole Cadwalladr showed ChatGPT give a Ted Talk in the style of Carole Cadwalladr and, sure enough, it gave a talk that wasn’t quite as good as the talk she gave, but it was pretty impressive. And she said, ‘OK, it’s great, but I did not consent to this.’”ShouldOpenAIbe using work of people who haven’t consented, he asked. Shouldn’t they be paid?Altman simply avoided the question. “So right now if you use our image generation thing if you say I want something in the style of a living artist, it won’t do that,” he said, referring to the new image generation tool and convenientlyevading the fact that it does exactly that for writers and journalists.Instead, he talked about “the creative spirit of humanity” that AI would now “democratise”. New tools that would allow “new people to make better art, better novels, better content that we all enjoy”.A Canadian editor for the Globe and Mail told me they were now sending reporters to the US with burner phones and wiped laptopsThe point I’d made in my talk is that this entire AI gold rush is theft. So much of the training set for this entire industry is coming from us: our work, our words, our labour. Not just writers, but anyone who’s ever written anything online, as well as photographers, film-makers, musicians. It’s not innovation, it’s theft. But in talk after talk at the conference, this inconvenient truth was glossed over.Afterwards, backstage, I ran into Altman himself. His security guard hovered. “I don’t want to intrude,” I said. “No, I’m happy to answer questions,” he said. But the foundational question of taking other people’s work without permission is something he just can’t answer.“What’s the difference between me reading your work?” he asked. It’s all free to read. What’s the difference? You’re outputting to potentially millions of people for commercial gain for no recompense, I said. It’s fair use, he countered. It’s really not, I said. You’ve ingested the entire body of my work. It’s so easy to establish that.And he was gone. Back to the controls of the tank that is soon to roll over all of us.It wasn’t just the AI dominance that had changed Ted. My talk was the only one that addressed the current political moment, and among the 1,700 people there, it dominated conversation after conversation. A Ted fellow, a next-gen rising star, told me that some of her cohort in the US on visas or green cards had cancelled their trips, worried that they might be detained at the border when returning home. A Canadian editor for theGlobe and Mailtold me they were now sending reporters to the US with burner phones and wiped laptops. A historian at a non-profit specialising in black history told me of cancelled grants.Even Steven Pinker, the Harvard professor and popular science author who has documented what he sees as the upwards path of human progress, was uncharacteristically downbeat. The attacks on universities,including his own, had left him shaken.Meeting Pinker at the conference was another personal landmark. I first went to Ted 20 years ago as a guest of his. I watched Jimmy Wales give a talk on the online encyclopedia that anyone could write and anyone could edit and thought: “Well, that’ll never catch on”, and then he demo-edWikipediaand it blew my mind.I wrote up the event for theObserver,and it was the spark that led to me writing about these topics in a 20-year career with the paper. In 2011 and 2012 we put on our own Ted event, TEDxObserver, which I co-curated with theObserver’s former editor, John Mulholland. Ted and theObserverhave been entwined in my understanding of this world, from excited tech-utopian to where we are now, witnessing Silicon Valley’s merger with an axis of autocracy across the world.These vast data-harvesting tech monopolies that control our online world were never inevitable. And there is another way. We can go back to the future, to the democratic, inspiring, non-corporatised web that Wales proved was possible.We are not powerless. There are things we can do collectively. I learned that when 30,000Observerreaders rose up to support me in my legal case. Last week’s talk is dedicated to them, because without them I don’t know where I’d be now. But together, wewereable to hold power to account. And in the darkness that’s falling, I believe that rebuilding our information system – together – is the first step to getting out of this mess. This is my last signoff for theObserver. It’s been a ride.

There’s little evidence for this idea – and every reason to believe it could exacerbate risksSun 20 Apr 2025 13.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Apr 2025 21.30 EDTShareIn its desire to ensure the City of London remains attractive after Brexit, the Treasury seems to have forgotten one of the major lessons of the 2008 financial crisis: when regulation is lax, risks accumulate. This month, it launched a consultation about whether it was time tolighten the rulesgoverning alternative asset managers, including private equity and hedge funds, in the belief that doing so will boost growth. There is little evidence to support this idea, and every reason to think it could exacerbate systemic risks.The proposal is consistent with Rachel Reeves’s belief that expanding the financial sector will deliver economic prosperity. The chancellor has suggested that post-crisis regulations went“too far”. Those regulations included an EU directive targeting alternative investment funds. Before 2008, these funds operated mostly in the dark. There was no means of systematically tracking the leverage they were using, nor the dangers this might pose.Under the EU rules, leveraged funds managing €100m or more in assets had to comply with strict reporting requirements and hold enough capital to absorb losses. The Treasury is now considering lifting that €100m threshold to £5bn, which would exempt many funds from thefull listof EU rules. It will fall to the Financial Conduct Authority to decide which rules to apply. This is troubling.Ms Reeves has instructed the FCA to encourage financial“risk-taking”, and the regulator has boasted about slashing“red tape”. Both sound like recipes for recklessness. Though the marketplace for private equity and hedge funds was too small to cause a crisis back in 2008, it has sincetripled in size. Many private equity funds have started borrowing fromshadow banks, which aren’t subject to the same regulations or capital requirements as normal banks. Others have begun taking on evenmore debtthan usual. The Bank of England raised the alarm about theserisky practicesin 2023, and has suggested that mainstream banks may beunwittingly exposedto the industry. These are reasons for more oversight, not less.If the FCA loosens the rules, fund managers will havegot their way. They lobbied to have the EU directive watered down in 2010, and the UK was one of the few countries tooppose the rules. Then, as now, the government wanted to protect the City, believing it to be a goose that lays golden eggs. This antipathy towards financial regulation was a prelude to the “Singapore on Thames” worldview promoted by Brexiters. Hedge fund and private equity managers donated lavishly to their cause. Astudy of Electoral Commission databy the academics Théo Bourgeron and Marlène Benquet revealed that these fund managers donated nearly £7.4m to the leave campaign, and just £1.25m to remain.The Treasury seems to think that unless the City gets what it wants, Britain maylose its fund managersto countries such as Luxembourg. There are many reasons to be wary of liberalising finance. One is that it will hinder, rather than help, economic growth. Research suggests that once the sector exceeds a certain size, it starts to become a drag ongrowth and productivity. A study from the University of Sheffield found that the UK lost out onroughly three years of average GDP growthbetween 1995 and 2015 thanks to its bloated financial sector. Watering down regulations might be helpful for fund managers. It is hard to see who else would benefit.Explore more on these topicsFinancial sectorOpinionRachel ReevesLabourEconomicsBankingFinancial Conduct AuthorityBank of EnglandeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Sir Keir Starmer should say yesSun 20 Apr 2025 13.25 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Apr 2025 21.30 EDTShareStrong hints that a rebranded “youth opportunity scheme” will top the EU’s wishlist atnext month’s EU-UK summitare good news for anyone who regrets the diminished travel opportunities that were one result of Brexit. Rising expectations ofnew European train routes– possibly including direct trains from London to Italy – can only add to the appeal of a potential rule change.There were more consequential impacts of Brexit than restrictions on travel. The disruption of trade, which is predicted by the Office for Budget Responsibility to cause a4% reduction in long-run productivity, is far more significant economically.Drug shortagescontinue to create risks to people’s health, and cause problems for doctors and pharmacists. Cancer research and trials have also been badly affected, according to a new report, because of the increased difficulty of attracting scientists and funding.But the cancellation of the UK’s membership of the Erasmus student exchange programme, the removal of the automatic right for UK citizens to work in EU countries (and the reciprocal right for EU citizens), and the erection of numerous other obstacles to travel, have together made for a big change in the cultural weather. Collectively, and as Brexiters intended, we have become morecut off from our neighbours.Spending extended periods in Germany, Spain, France or another EU country was never something that most young adults did. Yet in 2019-20almost 17,000 UK studentsand trainees undertook placements under Erasmus, while 22,000 European young people came for similar stays in the UK. Theresa May proposed a youth exchange scheme as part of her Brexit agreement. This was dropped under Boris Johnson. But since foreign travel is widely regarded as one of life’s great pleasures, and most people want the next generation to thrive, it is not surprising that a recent poll found 66% of the British public arein favour of relaxing the rules– including large majorities in Brexit-voting areas.Partly owing to the powerful pull of London, and the wish of millions of European young people to learn English, EU governments arekeen to rebuild arrangementsso that more young people have the chance to live in the UK. But when proposals for a new agreement were floated by the European Commission last year, they werebriskly shut downby both Rishi Sunak, who was prime minister at the time, and Labour. Diplomats have learned from this and engaged in some tactful rephrasing. Rather than “mobility”, which is thought to evoke echoes of free movement, any new scheme will beframed around “opportunity”. This would involve a special visa allowing citizens, probably up to age 30, to work or study abroad for up to four years. While the UK government has already shown an interest in bilateral schemes, it appears that the EU will negotiate any deal as a bloc.Particularly given therecent actions of the Trump White House, the UK ought to be seeking strengthened economic and political ties as well as cultural ones. Hurdles to cooperation on science and medicine must be cleared away. The renewal of a youth exchange scheme might seem unimportant by contrast. But while it would not be utterly transformative, at a time of geopolitical tumult, its importance shouldn’t be understated. Sir Keir Starmer should embrace the idea without delay. There is no easier way to signal that he is serious about closer cooperation.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionOpinionKeir StarmerEuropeBrexitYoung peopleStudentseditorialsShareReuse this content"

Wasn’t there anyone else we could have sent?, 14 April).Le Guin rightly suggests that it is an apparently unremarkable postmenopausal woman who is the ideal candidate to represent humanity on a space mission. The “crone” has a depth of experience of being human that no young, fit, looks-great-in-Lycra man or woman can match.Sure,Blue Origindidn’t expect to encounter alien life on a suborbital flight on the edge of space – unlike Le Guin’s intergalactic ambassador – but this flight, as Zoe Williams suggests, is still deeply symbolic of who is chosen as representatives of our strange race.The crone, having travelled through and embraced all stages of being a woman, is fit not just to represent womankind; having also endured life and death and change in a way that no man has ever experienced, she is most suited for representing humanity as a whole.Thankfully we do have alternative narratives which are more powerful than this tech bro fantasy. Le Guin’sSpaceCrone is a must-read.Georgina TreloarFolkestone, KentPublicising the posturing of the “crew” of Blue Origin (Blue Origin crew including Katy Perry safely returns to Earth after space flight, 14 April) overlooks as usual the achievements of the many engineers and scientists who made this trip possible, however pointless, both through their design of the craft and their control of its operation.In CM Kornbluth’s rather dark short story The Marching Morons (1951), Earth’s problem of overpopulation is solved by persuading the masses to board rockets that are making one-way trips to nowhere, in the belief that they are heading for a new and comfortable life on Venus.If Messrs Bezos and Musk could be persuaded to be part of the next “crew” of Blue Origin, perhaps the backroom team could help solve some of Earth’s current problems by providing enough extra boost for the rocket to be able to break out of Earth’s gravitational field.And yes, I am aware of what happened in the story to the person who came up with the idea, but I’m willing to take the risk.David BudgenDurhamI am in full agreement with Zoe Williams’ view about the wanton money waste of the recent flit into space by a group of women with luxuriant hair and tight clothing. But I have to disagree that they resembled Charlie’s Angels. Surely they were cosplaying early Star Trek, a TV series which I suspect would have been one of Jeff Bezos’s favourites.Claire WhatleyBerwick St James, WiltshireYour piece on the Blue Origin flight (Celebrities criticize all-female rocket launch: ‘This is beyond parody’, 15 April) says that it was “the first all-female space flight since 1963, when Soviet astronaut Valentina Tereshkova flew into orbit solo”. However, this overlooks the achievements of females such as Martine, a pig-tailed macaque, sole occupant of a French Vesta rocket launched on 7 March 1967. She survived the flight, living for several years afterwards, and – rather inspiringly – never tried to cash in on the experience.Andrew CarrollCastletimon, County Wicklow, IrelandContributors to your letters page (15 April) criticise the short journey into space taken by Jeff Bezos’s wife and her friends. The environmental damage done by such a trip is “colossal” (Chris Burr). Those on board were not “crew” as often described, merely passengers (Dan Stacey). The triviality of the jaunt is captured by Toby Wood’s phrase “ladies who launch”. We might expand on this: there is no such thing as a free launch.Richard SmithDurhamDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers? If so, pleaseclick hereto upload it.

Yet still we watch, unmovedRobin McKieThe degradation of the Arctic tundra has triggered a terrible chain reaction that can only lead to greater mayhemSun 20 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTShareThe problems that now afflict attempts to establish a military presence in the far north of Canada andGreenlandprovide timely warnings about the miseries that lie ahead for the rest of the planet as global warming continues its remorseless spread.The Arctic has suffered especially early impacts becausetemperatures here are rising faster than in any other part of our planet. Crucially, this process threatens to trigger even greater climatic mayhem.Ice is highly effective at reflecting solar radiation back into space, so when the region’s floes and glaciers start to disintegrate and disappear, more and more of the dark soil and ocean that lie below are exposed to sunlight and start to heat up, causing further warming. In effect, humanity is turning up the thermostat that once reflected sunlight and cooled the planet.This loss of ice has other disturbing consequences. As it disappears, shipping and oil drilling are expanding across the entire region while tourism is spreading. More and more giant cruise ships and tankers are making increasing numbers of visits to the land of ice and snow. In their wake, air and noise pollution in theArcticare worsening, disruptions to marine ecosystems are increasing, and the risks of catastrophic oil spills or major waste discharges are rising with each passing year.At the same time, Inuit communities, which were once linked by ice, are now facing major social disruption as it disappears and leaves their towns and villages isolated. People living in the Arctic also face major health risks from the increasing fragility of local sea ice and from the spread of diseases in the region’s warming air.Then there is the impact on wildlife. Polar bears use ice as platforms for hunting, while other creatures, such as seals, find refuge beneath it. In fact, the region’s entire food chain is affected, starting with algae. It grows on the underside of sea ice and is eaten by krill, which are then eaten by Arctic cod, which in turn are eaten by seals, who are a favourite prey for polar bears. Take away the underpinning layer of algae and all sorts of unpleasant consequences could occur.An avalanche of disruption and desecration has began to sweep the world’s upper latitudes. These should act as stark warnings about the risks that face the rest of our planet.Sadly, such alerts seem to be having little impact on humanity, which still shows few signs it is going to stop burning fossil fuels or curtail greenhouse gas emissions, the prime causes of global heating. The blight that now affects the Arctic seems destined set to spread to other lands and continents in the near future.Explore more on these topicsArcticThe ObserverClimate crisisIceGreenlandCanadaanalysisShareReuse this content"

The rising frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as drought and frost, have reduced their economic prospects and migration has accelerated as the environment becomes more unpredictable.“The climate isn’t like it used to be,” says Nico Mamani Lima, a farmer and agronomist from Ayo Ayo.But Mamani and others believe they have found a solution incañahua, a little-known relative of the Andean staple crop quinoa. Known for its resistance to drought, pests and frost, the plant – what is known as a pseudocereal – is packed with protein and nutrients and grows faster than quinoa.These characteristics, say farmers and agronomists, could make cañahua important in stemming the tide of migration from Bolivia’s countryside.View image in fullscreenThe plant grows faster than quinoa and is resistant to pests, drought and frost.Photograph: Manuel Seoane/The GuardianBolivia’s exodusfrom the countryside is driven mainly by the climate crisis and regional factors combining to cause dramatic changes in precipitation, withchronic droughtinterspersed withtorrential rains. The high, dry Altiplano is especially sensitive to drought, with once-vastlakes disappearingin its wake; Lake Poopó, once the country’s second-largest lake, was officially declared evaporated in 2015.Many communities are unable to sustain themselves in this less hospitable climate. As rural areas are hollowed out, Bolivia’s population has become increasinglyconcentrated in cities. At least1.8 million Bolivians live abroad, about 16% of the country’s population.Most of Mamani’s childhood friends and classmates have left their home town to live in Chile, Argentina and Brazil, where they work in textile factories or harvesting crops. Mamani is one of only three people of his generation still living in Ayo Ayo.View image in fullscreenEugenia Clotilde Layme Quispe, 74, and her sister Justina Layme Quispe, 72, both members of the Ayo Ayo association of cañahua producers, talk with Nico Mamani Lima.Photograph: Manuel Seoane/The GuardianFor those who find work in neighbouring countries, living conditions are difficult. “They have to work seven days a week and barely get to rest six hours, or sometimes not at all,” says Mamani.Migration from the countryside also threatens food security and the country’s sovereignty. “The majority of farmers are elderly,” says Jorge Eduardo Jiménez García, who works in cañahua marketing. “If we think about it, who will grow our food in 10 years?”To create economic opportunity in rural areas, Mamani founded an association of cañahua producers in Ayo Ayo in 2019, hoping that the crop’s adaptability to climate change could provide alternatives to migration.This crop is ancient and highly adaptableThough native crops such as cañahua (Chenopodium pallidicaule) and quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) were staples in the Andean highlandsin pre-Hispanic times, the arrival of wheat during Spanish colonisationthreatened to wipe them out.“The production of cañahua and quinoa was prohibited,” says Trigidia Jiménez Franco, 58, an agronomist who cultivates the Andean plant on her farm, Granja Samiri.View image in fullscreenTrigidia Jiménez Franco inspects cañahua grains.Photograph: Manuel Seoane/The GuardianAfter Bolivia’s independence, farmers continued growing the crop, but it was eaten mainly by those who produced it. When globalisation brought wheat and sugar to rural communities, it was again at risk of disappearing. “People used to drinkpito de cañahua,” says Jiménez, referring to a soft drink made by toasting and grinding the grain. “It was being replaced by Coca-Cola.”Recently, cañahua has begun to makea comebackdue to its resilience to drought and frost, its faster growth cycle and stable market prices compared with quinoa.Cañahua “is shorter in stature, but more resilient”, says Jamir Inti Canaviri Jiménez, 29, Jiménez’s son and Granja Samiri’s production manager. Its hightolerance of salty soils, which are quite common in arid conditions such as the Andean highlands, also means it can thrive where other crops cannot. “It seems to use salts as essential nutrients,” he says. “It beats every other crop.”The plant also tolerates variations in the length of the growing season, which have become more unpredictable with the climate crisis. “This crop is ancient and highly adaptable,” says Ernesto Huanca Limachi, who leads the Andean Grains Project at theNational Institute of Agricultural and Forestry Innovation(INIAF).View image in fullscreenJiménez in the cañahua fields on Granja Samiri in Bolivia’s western Oruro department.Photograph: Manuel Seoane/The GuardianTrigidia Jiménez is largely responsible for cañahua’s resurgence. Born into a family of wheat farmers, she and her family migrated to the nearby city of Oruro when she was young. After studying agriculture, Jiménez returned to the countryside in 2001. “As an agronomist, it wasn’t my thing to be in an office,” she says.After her original plans to raise sheep went awry with an early rain season, Jiménez tried growing cañahua on her in-laws’ land in Bolivia’s western Oruro department. Friends and family members doubted her decision, as it was seen as a food only consumed by rural farmers with little market value.

Granja Samiri is now working on exporting cañahua to other countries in Latin America as well as new markets such as Britain.Granja Samiri is an intergenerational affair, with Jiménez’s adult children and extended family members participating in producing, processing, and commercialising the Andean seed.Jorge Eduardo Jiménez García, 28, Jímenez’s nephew, hopes that cañahua might help other families to build their livelihoods in the countryside. “We want young people to be able to return to the countryside,” he says, “because you can also make a living in rural areas.”In Ayo Ayo, Mamani sees early signs of that vision being possible. When he started the association of cañahua growers in 2019, almost no one was interested, he says. “Everyone said: ‘What good is cañahua?’”View image in fullscreenCañahua pancakes. The pseudocereal can be ground into a flour and used as a wheat replacement.Photograph: Manuel Seoane/The GuardianWilmer Quispe Calle, 43, has cultivated cañahua all his life but only recently started selling it after the cañahua growers’ association was formed. “When a frost comes, it kills all the potatoes,” he says. “Cañahua is resistant: it’s affected, but not as much.”Quispe’s children are now studying in La Paz and Brazil, and plan to return to Ayo Ayo after graduation. The long-term economic and social impacts of cañahua in Bolivia remain to be seen, but many who cultivate the seed are hopeful.“I always have faith in cañahua,” says Canaviri. “It changed my whole social and economic outlook. That’s why it came to this world – to protect food sovereignty.”Explore more on these topicsBoliviaSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanAmericasFoodAgricultureDepopulationClimate crisisDroughtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They are typically hired to work remotely, enabling them to escape detection and send their wagesto Kim Jong-un’s state.Google said in a report this month that a case uncovered last year involved a single North Korean worker deploying at least 12 personae across Europe and the US. The IT worker was seeking jobs within the defence industry and government sectors. Under a new tactic, the bogus IT professionals have been threatening to release sensitive company data after being fired.John Hultquist, the chief analyst at Google’s Threat Intelligence group, told the Guardian that North Korea had turned to Europe, and the UK in particular, after it became more difficult to implement its fake worker ploy in the US.He said: “North Korea is facing pressure in the US and it is particularly focused on the UK for extending its IT worker tactic. It is in the UK where you can see the most extensive operations in Europe.”The fake IT worker scam typically works with the help of “facilitators”, or people with a physical presence in the country where the company inadvertently employing the North Korean agents is based.These facilitators carry out important assisting work such as providing false passports and maintaining a physical address in the country, where laptops are sent to the IT employee when they are hired.This laptop is then made accessible to a person working for Pyongyang, who typically does not reside in the same country as the facilitator. However, the fake workers are also known to be taking advantage of companies offering “bring your own device” employment, in which the devices are less easily monitored.“The bottom line is their operations have a physical presence in the UK, which is the most important step to grow across multiple sectors in the country,” said Hultquist.Hultquist said carrying out job interviews in person or on video would disrupt North Korean tactics.“Many of the remedies are in the hands of the HR department, which usually has very little experience dealing with a covert state adversary,” he said. “If you want to you’ve got to use background checks, do a better job checking physical identities, and ensuring the person you’re talking to is who they claim to be. This scheme usually breaks down when the actor is asked to go on camera or come into the office for an interview.”Sarah Kern, a North Korea specialist at the cybersecurity firm Secureworks, said the threat was “more widespread than companies realise”.She added that British firms could fight the threat by verifying candidates thoroughly and educating their HR departments about the ploy. They should then conduct in-person or video interviews to check that the prospective employee they are considering hiring tallies with who is on their CV.“In the US it has also been fruitful to conduct in-person interviews, or at the very least video interviews, and checking that you’re talking to who was actually advertised on the résumé,” she said.Kern said telltale signs that an IT worker may not be who they claim to be include frequent changes in address and where they want their wages sent – such as money exchange services rather than a conventional bank account.The bogus IT professionals are being recruited in Europe recruited through online platforms including Upwork, Freelancer and Telegram. Upwork said any attempt to use a false identity was a “strict violation of our terms of use” and the company takes “aggressive action to … remove bad actors from our platform”.Kern added:“We observed that they were very avoidant of video interviews because often they’re located in a working centre where there’s a lot of these North Korean IT workers working from one small room.“They wouldn’t want to show their video, or it sounded like they’re in a call centre, but with no actual reason as to why.”Explore more on these topicsTechnologyThe Society interviewCybercrimeNorth KoreaScamsInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

I think the growth of farmers’ markets, they are a much more discerning audience that wants to know where their meat comes from. I don’t think British farmers have anything to fear from this long term.”Both the government and the Conservatives have objected to US demands for its producers to be able to sell chicken withlower welfare standardsin the UK. Britain does not allow imports of products such as chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-injected beef and Donald Trump has been pushing for agriculture to be part of a trade deal if the UK wants tariffs to be lowered on its exports such as cars and steel.In the interview in Lancashire, whereReform is challengingboth the Tories and Labour for council seats, Farage also spoke about his rift with Trump’s adviser the US billionaire Elon Musk, who had been pushing for him to take a harder line on immigration and support the far-right figure Tommy Robinson.He said he had been in contact with Musk since their spat on X, but added: “I’ve fought against this for 25 years. You can’t bully me, I know what I think is right and what I think is wrong. Nobody pushes me around – not even him.”Reform is hoping to take hundreds of seats off the established parties at the local elections, with a three-way split in the polls between Farage’s party, Labour and the Tories.Keir Starmer’s Labour is narrowly ahead in most surveys. However, an MRP poll by More in Common found this weekend that Reform could win more seats than the other parties at a general election even if it has a slightly lower vote share.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It indicated 67 seats for the Lib Dems on 13.3% of the vote and 35 for the SNP on 2.2%.Its modelling suggested that if a general election were held now then Labour could lose 246 seats, including 10 cabinet ministers, with losses to Reform in the”red wall”andWelsh valleys, and to the SNPin Scotland.The poll also indicated Labour was being squeezed from both sides, with progressive voters looking to the Lib Dems, Greens and independents causing seats to be lost to the right.The polling suggests the main parties could be on course for difficult local elections on 1 May, although they are hard to forecast on account of the often low turnout.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageReform UKTrump tariffsDonald TrumpFood safetyChickenInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

She was unselfish, always ready to encourage with love and support those around her to achieve more than they themselves thought possible.”He added that she left behind “an unfillable void” in the lives of her mother, Maureen, her three adult children, two stepchildren and colleagues and friends, including those from her sporting activities.“Sue was loved, and will be painfully missed by her entire family and friends, we ask that our privacy at this difficult time be respected,” he said.Officers from three different forces have made six arrests in total relating to the incident.West Midlands police arrested three men on 16 April, including a 51-year-old man, from Bloxwich, arrested on suspicion of murder; a 22-year-old man, from Dudley, on suspicion of manslaughter and assisting an offender; and a 41-year-old man, from Worcester, on suspicion of assisting an offender.Officers from Staffordshire police arrested another man, aged 34, of Wednesbury, on 18 April on suspicion of manslaughter.Two other men, aged 36 and 26, both of Coseley, were arrested on 18 April by officers in south Wales, each on suspicion of assisting an offender.The suspects are being questioned by detectives in custody in Staffordshire, except for the suspect from Worcester, who has since been released and placed on conditional police bail.The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is continuing to investigate the circumstances prior to the collision, when West Midlands police officers were responding to the vehicle being involved in reports of suspicious activity.Officers are continuing to appeal for information and are particularly keen to hear via anonline portalfrom anyone who was in the area of Blake Street and Birmingham Road between Sutton Coldfield and Shenstone in the morning of 11 April, and those with dashcam, CCTV and doorbell footage.Explore more on these topicsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Retailers like M&S now offer punnets of kumquats, while Waitrose has reported a 27% rise in sales ofyuzujuice.Riverford, which offers boxes of organic produce for home delivery, has noticed a similar trend. The company has seen steady sales of kumquats, with sub-varieties and hybrids like Tacle mandarins (a cross between a clementine and a Tarocco orange) and Ruby Valencias (which have the sweetness of orange but the flavour of grapefruit) performing especially well.“It’s generally unknown just how much variety there is in shape, size, flavour, and use of citrus,” said Dale Robinson at Riverford. “When consumers see that, they want to try it.”Emilie Wolfman, trend innovation manager at Waitrose, said unusual types of citrus were seeing a boom in popularity and the supermarket has seen an increase in recipe searches for premium fruits like Sorrento lemons, blood oranges and red grapefruit. “Chefs and home cooks alike are embracing its year-round versatility,” she said.As ever, restaurants have led the charge, with chefs using slices of cedro lemon, squeezes ofkalamansi, and pearls of lime caviar in savoury and sweet dishes across the UK.View image in fullscreenA fruit sculpture celebrates the 90th Lemon festival in Menton, France, last year.Photograph: Sébastien Nogier/EPA“These citrus varieties bring a whole new vocabulary of taste,” said chef Mauro Colagreco, whose restaurant at the OWO in Raffles hotel, London, recently gained a Michelin star. Bergamot and makrut (commonly known as kaffir) lime are used to flavour broths, and the zest of Buddha’s hand (a variety with finger-like segments) and yuzu are grated over everything from raw fish to meringue-based desserts.Colagreco has brought his passion for citrus diversity from his 130-variety garden in Menton, a town in the French Riviera, where his three-Michelin star restaurant, Mirazur, is located.“I believe British chefs are more than ready for a citrus revolution,” he said. “In fact, I think it has already begun.”Tom and Mathilda Tsappis, the husband-and-wife team behind Killiecrankie House in Perthshire, Scotland, use different citrus fruits depending on the season. “In winter, we showcase Japanese varieties like yuzu, sudachi, and mikan,” said Mathilda. “We use yuzu in a turbot beurre blanc and Ecclefechan tart to balance the sweetness. We also turn yuzu peels into a punchy miso condiment for fatty meats and fish.”Shrub, a UK fruit and vegetable wholesaler established in 2020, has partnered with Todolí Citrus Foundation, a research centre in Valencia. Shrub is now handling the logistics and distribution of Todolí’s unique citrus fruits to consumers in London and the south-east.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFeastFree weekly newsletterRecipes from all our star cooks, seasonal eating ideas and restaurant reviews.

In addition to supplying restaurants, a 3kg mixed Todolí citrus box has been made available to home chefs.Cornish Citrus at Curgurrell Farm is now commercially producing Meyer lemons and limes in the UK, using unheated glass and polythene, resulting in virtually carbon-free citrus. One chef who has taken notice is Andy Benyon of the Michelin-starred Behind in London Fields, who is incorporating in-season Tahiti and makrut limes into his kitchen. “I grate them straight into dressings for a clean hit of acidity,” he said.Colagreco’s research and development team at Mirazur discovered that mandarins arrived in Europe via England in 1805, when two varieties were introduced at London’s Kew Gardens, before spreading to the Mediterranean by 1850. Mediterranean citrus culture is therefore “a heritage that we owe to the English”, Colagreco said.“The citrus revolution isn’t just about flavour. It’s about connection to nature, cultural exchange, and rethinking what freshness can mean.“British chefs are not only ready – they’re helping to lead this movement.”Explore more on these topicsFruitThe ObserverFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

In January 2022, he was stripped of his military roles and use of HRH title a month before he settled a legal dispute with one of Epstein’s victims Virginia Giuffre, who alleged she had been assaulted by the the duke.Andrew’s links to an alleged Chinese spy, Yang Tengbo –also known as Chris Yang– have heaped further embarrassment on the royal family. Andrew missed the traditional Christmas gathering at Sandringham last year, after Yang was banned from the UK on security grounds.Yang has denied suggestions he was involved in espionage and said he had “done nothing wrong or unlawful”.Papers released from a special immigration tribunalearlier this month disclosed that Yang had advised Andrew on letters he wrote directly to China’s president, Xi Jinping.According to one document, from Dominic Hampshire, who worked for Andrew from 2019 to 2022, these letters were written each year on Xi’s birthday. Hampshire’s statement to the tribunal said: “The royal household, including the late queen, were fully aware of this communication – it was certainly accepted and it may be fair to say it was even encouraged – it was an open channel of communication that was useful to have.”Also attending the Easter service were the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh and their son James, the Earl of Wessex, Princess Eugenie and her husband, Jack Brooksbank, and Princess Beatrice and her husband, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi.The Prince and Princess of Wales are spending the weekend with their children in Norfolk. The Waleses, who have a country home, Anmer Hall, on the Sandringham estate, missed the annual service last year after Kate, who is in remission, was diagnosed with cancer.Meanwhile, the archbishop of York gave the Easter sermon on Sunday, in place of the archbishop of Canterbury. Delivering the Church of England’s primary Easter message from York Minster, Stephen Cottrell called for peace, citing Israel and Gaza, Ukraine, Myanmar, Sudan and DR Congo as “places of conflict that convulse our world”.He also spoke against “the madness of a world which ‘others’ others, drives wedges between communities, breeds hatred and promotes greed”.The former archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, announced his resignation in November in the wake of a report that found he could have brought the serial abuser John Smyth to justice if he had reported him to police in 2013. Cottrell, his interim replacement, has also faced calls to resign over his decisions when handling the case.Explore more on these topicsPrince AndrewKing Charles IIIQueen CamillaPrincess AnneSarah FergusonMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

Two were seriously injured after being doused in hot cooking fat and stabbed, one five times in the torso, in a sustained assault.The body representing prison officers will call for all staff to have stab vests, and also for electric stun guns for selected officers. It will also demand that an American “Supermax”-style regime is imposed on Britain’s worst inmates.The Prison Officers’ Association (POA) wants electric stun guns issued to specialist teams in at least the highest-security prisons, to quell attacks that threaten the lives of officers.The devices fire 50,000 volts to incapacitate a suspect, and are billed as a less lethal option than firearms, though some uses have been linked to deaths.Abedi, 28, the brother of the Manchester Arena bomber, Salman, is serving a 55-year sentence. The attack on the three officers happened in a kitchen area of the separation unit at HMP Frankland.Mark Fairhurst, the chair of the POA, said: “We now need the tactical use of Taser as an option when faced with life-threatening situations. The threat in our prisons is such that we need that option available.”Police officers across the UK can be issued with electric stun guns to use on the streets if they perceive sufficient threat.Fairhurst said electric stun guns should be available for those guarding terrorists and other seriously violent convicted criminals when prison officers believed their livesor those of their colleagues were at risk.He said: “Say staff are getting attacked by someone with a sharp-edged weapon, who is trying to kill them. All we have available at the moment is pava spray [similar to pepper spray] and a baton. When I call for assistance, what we need is a response team to turn up who have the option of using Taser.“A sharp-edged weapon is as deadly as a knife. The idea we are going to fight them off with a baton and a canister of spray is putting my members’ lives at risk. You can’t run away, you are in an enclosed environment.”The POA is asking for electric stun guns first to be given to response teams at the highest-security prisons, which all have separation units or their equivalent, for prisoners deemed to be highly dangerous or disruptive.Those prisons include Frankland, where the attack took place on Saturday 12 April; Belmarsh, where Abedi had previously attacked officers; Full Sutton; Long Lartin and Whitemoor.The meeting on Wednesday afternoon will be between the POA and Mahmood. Fairhurst said parts of prisons with the ultimate security should adopt “Supermax” rules.In this plan, selected high-risk inmates would leave their cell only when handcuffed and escorted by three staff, there would be no mixing with other prisoners, and they would be restricted to their basic entitlement of rights and privileges.Fairhurst said: “It’s called a separation centre for a reason. We’re just treating them like everyone else.”He said the set of demands was reasonable and that he was hopeful, adding that the strength of feeling was such that the government would be “foolish not to consider them”.The Ministry of Justice did not comment on whether it would consider issuing Tasers to some prison officers. The government has announced a review and has already banned inmates in separation units having access to knives orbeing allowed to prepare meals in kitchens.“This will look into how this was able to happen, and what we must do to better protect our prison officers in the future,” Mahmood said on Friday.The attacks are being investigated by counter-terrorism police because of Abedi’s past. They have searched the prison looking for where and how the makeshift blade was made, and signs of violent Islamist extremist literature.Also in the separation unit at HMP Frankland wasAnjem Choudary, serving life imprisonment after being convicted of directing a terrorist organisation, membership of a proscribed organisation, and encouraging support for a terrorist organisation.Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationShabana MahmoodUK criminal justiceTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

They will includetightening the criteria for personal independence payments (Pip)for people with disabilities, to limit the number of people who can claim it. Under the changes, people who are not able to wash the lower half of their body, for example, will no longer be able to claim Pip unless they have another limiting condition.A major rebellion appears to be hardening on the Labour benches rather than subsiding, despite frantic efforts by whips and government ministers to talk MPs round.View image in fullscreen‘We are being asked to take a leap of faith. It does not make sense’: Neil Duncan-Jordan, Labour MP for Poole.Photograph: Peter Flude/The GuardianOne idea being floated as a way to win over rebels is for ministers to publish their long-awaitedchild poverty strategyshortly before the key Commons votes, and in it offer additional money for poor parents of children under five. Work and pensions secretary Liz Kendall is understood to be examining a proposal focused on the youngest children that would cost less than the £3.6bn needed to scrap entirely the controversial two-child limit on benefit payments. It is now accepted in government that, given the state of public finances, the cap cannot be scrapped in the short term.Many of the several dozen Labour MPs who are angry at their party’s cuts say they will refuse to get involved in any such “trade off” involving children in poverty and the disabled.Rachael Maskell, the Labour MP for York Central, who is planning to vote against the legislation, said: “You can’t compromise with a trade-off under which you say you will take more children from poor families out of poverty by placing more disabled people into poverty. That simply cannot be right.“The government really does need to start listening to MPs, civil society and the population at large because there is really widespread opposition to these policies.”Ministers and the Labour whips have been holding talks with concerned MPs over recent days, only to find the strength of feeling is not abating. A group of MPs is understood to be preparing to break cover by calling for a complete rethink. One government source said: “If anything, I think there is more worry than there was. It is like this is non-negotiable for many of our people.”View image in fullscreen‘The government really does need to start listening’: Rachael Maskell, Labour MP for York Central.Photograph: Richard Saker/The GuardianAnother major complaint from Labour MPs is that they will be asked to vote on the legislation to implement the benefits cuts before the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has concluded an impact assessment on the effect they will have on getting people off welfare and into the workforce – the stated objective of the cuts. The OBR report is not due until the autumn.Last month,Keir Starmer said there was a “moral” as well as an economic case for reforming the benefit system. “It is indefensible, economically and morally, and we must and we will reform it. We will have clear principles, we will protect those who need protecting.“We will also support those who can work back to work, but Labour is the party of work – we’re also the party of equality and fairness.”Another Labour MP opposed to the cuts, Neil Duncan-Jordan, who won the seat of Poole in Dorset by just 18 votes last July, overturning a Conservative majority of 19,000, said he had more than 5,000 Pip recipients in his seat.He said he could not support any compromise or “trade off”. “There is not a hierachy of need,” he said. “The whole policy is wrong. It goes without saying that if these benefits cuts go through, I will be toast in this seat.”Duncan-Jordan said it did not make sense that MPs were being asked to vote on the cuts before the OBR had reported on how effective they would be in returning people to the workplace. “We are being asked to take a leap of faith. It does not make sense.”In its report accompanying Rachel Reeves’s spring statement, the OBR said that “the full impacts of these policies are very uncertain, given the complexity of how trends in health, demography and the economy interact with the benefits system (as our 2024 welfare trends report explored).“Welfare reforms incorporated into previous OBR forecasts have in many cases saved much less than initially expected, such as the transition from disability living allowance to Pip, or taken far longer to implement than expected, as was the case for the roll-out of universal credit.”The OBR added: “We will undertake a full assessment of the potential impact of the Green Paper polices on the labour market ahead of our next forecast.”Explore more on these topicsBenefitsThe ObserverLabourDisabilityKeir StarmerLiz KendallnewsShareReuse this content"

But until the people come to their senses, I will stand,” said Raj Forhad, aReform UKcandidate.The 43-year-old, who owns a software business, is part of a growing group in politics: British voters from minority ethnic backgrounds who campaign for Nigel Farage’s party.Recent research has found Reformtends to poll bestin areas with a large white population. Polling indicates the party, whichis criticisedby anti-racism campaigners,had a vote shareof 3% among minority ethnic voters, compared with 16% among white voters.However, the party fielded 17 candidates from ethnic minorities in the 2024 general election, and some insiders regard the ability to win over voters traditionally loyal to Labour – including Black and Asian people in big cities – as “pivotal” to its growth.The local elections on 1 May represent a milestone for Reform, which is also eyeing the Runcorn parliamentary byelection and mayoral elections on the same day.But some party activists are already looking ahead to 2026, when London’s local elections take place, eager to learn if they can turn values among minority ethnic communities – particularly regarding enterprise, education, family and faith – into votes.“We’re putting the same effort into bringing over true Labour voters as we did into bringing over Conservatives. London is the acid test,” said Neville Watson, Reform’s only Black branch chair.Hainault is an east London ward that will be voting on 1 May, in a Redbridge council byelection in which Forhad is standing. He stood in last year’s general election as the candidate for Ilford South, where he said he was attacked on the campaign trail for standing for Reform, but did not report it to police.Forhad came to the UK from Bangladesh in 2010. “The main reason I joined Reform is because of the policies they have, the contract they have with the people, the country, on the NHS, on immigration,” he said. “Myself as an immigrant, the way illegal migrants are brought in this country, that’s impacting everyone.”View image in fullscreenNeville Watson, the chair of Reform’s Enfield branch.Watson, who chairs Reform’s branch in Enfield, north London, says he “firmly” supports “positive immigration that is managed, coordinated and thoughtfully timed”.“It’s about space, not race,” the father-of-two said when asked how he reconciled his identity as the son of Jamaica-born Windrush generation parents with perceptions of his party. “I have the values my family – who put so much in – have always stood for: hard work and aspiration.”A community activist with a background in social enterprise, youth work and SEND, Watson “personally” supports economic reparations for the “unimaginable wrong” of slavery. He said it had driven a “deep-rooted and sometimes subconscious racism” and “left a deep, indelible mark on the lives of a people”.So what attracted him to Reform? “Brexit,” for starters. He added: “I sought a political home where I could express my authentic voice, one that embraces my Christian faith with confidence. Reform UK represents the values that were once central to mainstream politics but have now shifted to the right. It’s a space where these principles can thrive and be championed unapologetically.”Like Watson, Navtaij Sangha, a former British army bursar from a “military Sikh family”, is a north London-based Reform activist who believes Britain is exemplary. “Where in the world would you have access to the best education, the best job opportunities?” the 45-year-old management consultant said. “There may be barriers and challenges, but it probably is somewhere like the UK.”He added: “We haven’t got it 100% perfect. But I think it’s class that drives [inequality], not race.”Forhad, setting out from home to put leaflets through doors, agrees. He is insistent that if he can get on, anyone can.“All this campaigning I feel I owe to this country, because this country has given me everything: my life, my future, my career,” he said. “The way this country has given me the foundation, with my intellect, my talent, that’s understood by Reform UK – and they valued my contribution. Some of the negative campaigning that Reform is a racist party I think is complete nonsense.”He added: “Myself, I’m a Muslim, but I believe my religion is a private matter, nothing to do with my politics, because if I consider myself as a Muslim voter then I’m not considering my residents who are Christian, or Jews, who are Hindu, who are atheist. I have that kind of positive mindset.”Labour dominates Forhad’s area, at ward and constituency level. But he sees an opportunity to win people over on local issues – such as potholes, policing andUlez– along with the message of “family, community, country”.In north London, Sangha has been working on a long-term strategy for how Reform “can take the big cities … something the Tories cannot do”.Like Watson, Sangha thinks Labour, which enjoyed a 46% vote share among minority ethnic voters, has taken that popularity for granted. His father, Mohinder Singh Sangha, is a Labour councillor in Leicester.Research has foundthat 35% of minority ethnic voters born outside the UK supported leave in the EU referendum, compared with 21% of those born in the UK, fora variety of reasons.“I think discussing immigration is not a bad thing,” Sangha said. “People that came in the 60s, the 70s … huge numbers of those settled immigrant communities voted for Brexit.”He added: “It is very easy to allow the debate to be hijacked by people who are frankly just nasty racists. But it’s equally destructive to just label anyone who wants to discuss these things as far-right.”Sangha said voters from British minority ethnic communities he had met while campaigning were wary of what he called “identity politics”.He said: “They kind of want to be left alone, to just get on with life, earn a living and bring up kids. And now suddenly the politics they’ve tried to escape is being imported.” He doesn’t accept that Reform has its own brand of “identity politics”.“I’m a big believer in the UK nation state,” Sangha added. “There has to be some kind of national unity … people just want things to work.”Watson said “past missteps” – incidents that may lead people to question whether Reform is really a force for national unity – were “opportunities to learn and grow”. Like Sangha, he said he had encountered patronising and divisive attitudes from some people on the left before joining Reform.“There’s a common misconception Black and Asian voters form a homogenous group,” he said. “While we may share certain aspirations – such as striving for the best for our children and valuing entrepreneurship, family and gender roles – our perspectives and priorities are as diverse as our communities.”Asked how he would answer criticism that Reform has a track record of statements and positions that are harmful to Britons from ethnic minorities, Watson said: “I’d acknowledge their concerns and emphasise that Reform is committed to evolving and listening.“It’s important to highlight that the party’s focus is on creating policies that benefit all Britons, regardless of background. Actions speak louder than words.”Explore more on these topicsLocal elections 2025Reform UKLocal politicsRaceLocal governmentfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Every parent has been in that position. A few more minutes in front of the television to keep them out from under your feet … A new smartphone, ignoring the nagging voice in your head that questions it, because ‘all my friends have one’, despite knowing how much time you spend on your own smartphone.“You are not supposed to be your child’s friend. Sometimes being the parent means making difficult decisions in your child’s long-term interests, no matter how loudly they disagree.“They need you to give them love, understanding, support and boundaries. It means listening to your child, always encouraging the height of their aspirations, but not just doing exactly what they want.”Nearly a quarter of children spend more than four hours a day on an internet-enabled device, a survey for the children’s commissioner suggested earlier this month.A YouGov poll of 502 children in England aged eight to 15 found that 23% spent more than four hours a day using an internet-enabled device with a screen, such as a computer, phone, tablet or gaming console.One in four (25%) spent two to three hours a day on such a device, while a fifth (20%) spent three to four hours a day, according to the survey, which was carried out in March and April.De Souza added that parents needed to “feel confident having challenging conversations with their children about the things they see online”.“We need parents to give their children the opportunities to talk about violent or sexual content they see online without simply having their device confiscated, because it will find them elsewhere,” she said. “As adults we are ourselves dopamine-addicted, stuck in a cycle of scrolling yet we still have no idea of what our children are seeing.”The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, is looking at the effects of smartphone bans in some schools in England, a policy idea supported by the National Education Union amid growing concerns of the impact of social media on children.The current non-statutory guidance states that schools should prohibit the use of mobile phones throughout the school day during lessons as well as break and lunchtimes, but does not say how schools should enforce the bans.De Souza’s survey of 15,000 state schools in England found that 99.8% of primaries and 90% of secondaries limited the use of mobiles during the day, including banning phones on school grounds, requiring children to hand in phones or leave them in a secure place that they cannot access in the day, or requiring them to be kept out of sight.De Souza, a former headteacher, has previously said banning mobile phones should be a school leader’s choice rather than imposed nationally by the government.She wrote in the Sunday Times that she believed “schools are only part of the solution”.“Head teachers have told me that despite their own policies they remain deeply concerned about children’s safety online, because most of the time children spend on their phones is outside school hours when they are in their parents’ care,” she said.Last month, the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, questioned why the government had opposed a Tory amendment to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill to require schools to ban the use of phones.Keir Starmer, the prime minister, described the proposal as “completely unnecessary” as he claimed that “almost every school” already banned phones.Explore more on these topicsSmartphonesChildrenSchoolsParents and parentingnewsShareReuse this content"

Oil prices tumbled to four-year lows of under $60 a barrel after Trump’s tariff announcement, and the International Energy Agency hasslashed its forecasts for global oil demandgrowth by a third for the year ahead.Moody’s said its negative outlook for theIneossubsidiary reflected the risk that it will not make a recovery within the next two years, “with challenging market conditions and uncertainty related to trade barriers”.The spiralling losses at Ineos Quattro over recent years stand in contrast to the €2.3bn profit it made in 2022 from manufacturing petrochemicals at its 45 sites across the Americas,Europeand Asia.Ratcliffe has blamed high energy costs, “the deindustrialisation of Europe” and “extreme carbon taxes” for the change in fortunes for the Ineos empire, which is made up of about 30 distinct companies that together operate more than 170 sites across 32 countries.Ineos Group, the empire’s main corporate unit, revealed earlier this month that it would not pay out any dividends to its owners – Ratcliffe, Andy Currie and John Reece – so that the cash can be reinvested in the business, in an example of “discipline and prudent financial management”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its debts are forecast to reach almost €12bn this year, the Guardianreportedin February.A spokesperson for the company said: “Despite the challenging global backdrop in 2024, Ineos Quattro maintained its position as one of the most competitive producers in the European chemicals sector.“We’re a low-cost, high-efficiency operator with market-leading positions and €2.14bn in cash.

Then it collided, catastrophically, with another object and shattered into pieces.One of these lumps becamethe asteroid Bennuwhose minerals, recently returned to Earth by the US robot space probe OSIRIS-REx, have now been found to containrich levels of complex chemicalsthat are critical for the existence of life.“There were things in the Bennu samples that completely blew us away,” said Prof Sara Russell, cosmic mineralogist at theNatural History Museumin London, and a lead author of a major study inNatureof the Bennu minerals. “The diversity of the molecules and minerals preserved are unlike any extraterrestrial samples studied before.”Results from this and other missions will form a central display at a Natural History Museum’s exhibition,Space: Could Life Exist Beyond Earth?, which opens on 16 May. It will be a key chance for the public to learn about recent developments in the hunt for life on other worlds, said Russell.View image in fullscreenThe Rosalind Franklin Mars rover.Photograph: Stocktrek Images, Inc./AlamyAs the exhibition will reveal, the basic chemical building blocks for life can be found in other objects in the solar system such as meteorites. However, the material from Bennu, which is named after an ancient Egyptian mythological bird, have been found to be particularly rich in these deposits. “Its parent world clearly had underground lakes of brine, and when these evaporated they left behind salts that resemble those found in dry lake beds on Earth,” said Russell.In addition, phosphates, ammonia and more than a dozen protein-building amino acids that are present in life forms on Earth – as well as the five nucleobase building blocks that make up RNA and DNA – were found in the samples brought back by OSIRIS-REx.“These strongly suggest that asteroids similar to Bennu crashed on to Earth, bringing crucial ingredients that led to the appearance of life here,” she added.Scientists do not believe life evolved on Bennu itself but do think other asteroids like it might have supplied other worlds with the basic ingredients for life. On Earth, with its warm, stable environment, this led to the first appearance of reproducing organisms more than 3.7 billion years ago. It remains to be seen if they appeared on other promising worlds such as Mars and the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, that include Europa, Ganymede, Titan and Enceladus. These are now the subject of a number of missions that will feature in the exhibition and include two probes now heading for Jupiter’s ice-covered moonsEuropaandGanymede, which are known to possess liquid water oceans.In addition, the UK-built Rosalind Franklin robot rover isscheduled to land on Marsin 2029 and will drill deep into its soil, seeking evidence of life.View image in fullscreenBennu asteroid samples.Photograph: Jonathan E Jackson/Natural History MuseumIn the past, samples of extraterrestrial rocks made available for study have been limited mainly to meteorites, pieces of the moon brought back by astronauts and robot probes, and lumps ofMarsthat were blasted towards Earth when large objects struck the red planet and blew debris into space – with some eventually falling on to our world as Martian meteorites.Visitors to the exhibition will be able to touch samples of lunar and Martian material as well as a meteorite that landed on our planet after breaking off from an asteroid. Intriguingly, this rock is older than the Earth itself.“This is going to be a blockbuster,” said Sinead Marron, the museum’s senior exhibitions manager.OSIRIS-REx brought back 120gm of Bennu dust to Earth, and the museum has been given around 200mg to study, said Russell. “When we first opened the capsule, we saw this black dust everywhere, with white particles in it. We thought it might be contaminated. But it turned out to be a compound of phosphorus we have not seen in meteorites but which is absolutely crucial to the development of life. I was astonished.”The prospects that life might exist elsewhere in the universe made headlines last week when it was announced that observations of the exoplanet K2-18b by the James Webb space telescope had revealed thechemical fingerprintsof two compounds that, on Earth, are only known to be produced by life.On their own, the chemicals, dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), do not amount to proof of alien biological activity but they have boosted hopes that we are not alone in the universe.Conclusively proving that life exists on distant worlds outside our solar system will be extremely hard, scientists acknowledge – short of a signal from an extraterrestrial intelligence announcing its existence.By contrast, alien lifeforms within our solar system will be easier to collect and study and may prove, one day, that life on other worlds does indeed exist.“What we would do about such a discovery is a different matter,” Marron said. “One of the things we will be asking exhibition visitors to think about is how we would treat life if we found it on Mars or another world. Would we stay away from it or try to interact with it?“Or would we try to eat it, like we eat lifeforms with whom we share this planet? Such questions about alien life help us reflect on the ways we engage with other forms of life in our own world.”Explore more on these topicsAlien lifeThe ObserverSpaceNatural History MuseumMuseumsMarsJupiterAsteroidsShareReuse this content"

The crowd, which responded with chants of“Viva il Papa!”or Long live the Pope! and “Bravo!”, was delighted when Francis looped through the square in his open-topped popemobile and then up and down the main avenue leading to it. He stopped occasionally to bless babies brought up to him, a scene that was common in the past but unthinkable just a few weeks ago when he was fighting for his life.“It is excellent, a miracle,” said Margarita Torres Hernández, a pilgrim from Mexico who was in the square. “Now that he has come out, for me it’s a miracle, it’s something very big, very beautiful.”Marcin Popowsky, a pilgrim from Poland, said he had been very touched to see the pope: “We’re very happy that we can see a pope in good shape,” he said.View image in fullscreenPope Francis is mobbed by well-wishers as tours St Peter’s Square in his popemobile.Photograph: Angelo Carconi/EPAFrancis has made only a handful of public appearances after leaving hospital and returning to theVaticanon 23 March. He skipped the solemn services of Good Friday and Holy Saturday, but had been expected to make an appearance on Sunday to celebrate the most important day in the Christian calendar.In accordance with his doctors’ orders for two months of convalescence and respiratory therapy to improve his lung function, he has cut back his workload.He did, however, find time on Sunday to meet the US vice-president, JD Vance, who had had “an exchange of opinions” with the Vatican’s secretary of state over international conflicts and immigrationwhen they met a day earlier. Vance and Francis have previously disagreed very publicly over the Trump administration’s attitudes to migrants and migration.According to a short statement from the Vatican, Vance met Francis at his residence for a few moments on Sunday morning “to exchange Easter greetings”.View image in fullscreenJD Vance speaks to the pope. The US vice-president converted to Catholicism in 2019.Photograph: Vatican Media/APIn thetraditionalUrbi et Orbimessage, which was read out on his behalf, Francis reminded Roman Catholics that Easter was a day of joyful resurrection but lamented the “contempt … stirred up at times towards the vulnerable, the marginalised, and migrants”.He also stressed the importance of using Easter to “revive our trust in others, including those who are different than ourselves, or who come from distant lands, bringing unfamiliar customs, ways of life and ideas. For all of us are children of God”.He went on to remind people of the suffering in Palestine, Israel, Ukraine, Sudan, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Myanmar, among many other places.“I appeal to all those in positions of political responsibility in our world not to yield to the logic of fear, which only leads to isolation from others, but rather to use the resources available to help the needy, to fight hunger and to encourage initiatives that promote development,” he said. “These are the ‘weapons’ of peace, weapons that build the future instead of sowing seeds of death.”The team of doctors who treated the pope for pneumoniarevealed last month that he had come so close to deaththat they had to choose whether “to let him go, or push forward”.Francis suffered four breathing crises during his stay in hospital, themost critical episode being on 28 February, when he inhaled his vomit.“We were all aware that the situation had further worsened and there was a risk that he would not make it,” Sergio Alfieri, a general surgeon at Gemelli hospital, said in an interview with Corriere della Sera published at the end of March.“We had to choose whether to stop and let him go, or push forward and try with all the drugs and therapies possible, running the very high risk of damaging other organs.

Further technical talks are due in Geneva this week, followed by another high-level diplomatic meeting next weekend in Oman.Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who was at the heart of the Rome talks, wants an agreement wrapped up within 60 days, but is likely to face resistance from Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, who believes the levels of distrust and the technical nature of the talks make such a swift agreement unlikely.The two most daunting issues are the storage or destruction of Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium, and the external guarantees that can be provided to Iran if the US was to breach an agreement to lift economic sanctions in return for Iran putting its civil nuclear programme back under external supervision by the UN inspectorate, the IAEA. Iran wants a guarantee of consequences for the US if it pulls out of or breaches another deal.Iran wants to keep its uranium stockpiles inside the country, but the US rejects this and wants either the stockpiles’ destruction or a transfer to a third country, such as Russia.Iran believes it has received assurances that the US objective is not the entire dismantling of its nuclear programme. Before the Rome talks, in an intervention that sowed confusion in Iran and the US, Witkoff had on social media seemed to endorse such an objective, causing consternation in Iran, but in Rome he gave the impression that this was largely domestic political messaging.Mohamed Amersi, a member of the advisory board at the Wilson Center, a Washington thinktank, said: “From the Iranian perspective there had been some conflicting messages on social media and in interviews about the US wanting the complete elimination of their nuclear programme and that was not at all what Araghchi had agreed, so the first assurance was that there had been no expansion in the US objectives. If he had not got that assurance it’s likely the whole negotiation would have been wrapped up, and ended immediately.”On guarantees, Iran believes the only secure agreement is a treaty signed by US Congress, but Araghchi was told it would be anyone’s guess whether Trump could get such an agreement through Congress given the strength of pro-Israeli opinion there.Another option is for the US to agree to cover Tehran’s losses if Washington were to pull out of a deal. The Iranians floated the idea of a financial penalty before, but the enforcement mechanism in the absence of a treaty remains problematic. A third option if the US is in breach is for Russia to be empowered to return the handed-over stockpile of highly enriched uranium to Tehran, so ensuring Iran would not be the party punished for non-compliance.Such an arrangement potentially gives Russia a pivotal role in the future US-Iran relationship, and might freeze out Germany, France and the UK, the current guarantors of the 2015 agreement. Neither Iran nor the US want to keep a major future role for the UN.Rome was seen by some as an important site for the talks, since if they went wrong the Italian prime minister,Giorgia Meloni, has the best relations with Trump, and so was well placed to mount a rescue operation. A tentative proposal for a meeting between Araghchi and the US vice-president, JD Vance, who was in Rome, was seen as premature.There is pressure on Witkoff and Trump to deliver on one of the three negotiations in which they are involved – Iran, Hamas-Israel, and Russia-Ukraine. One source said: “Whatever you may think of Iran, they are rational actors, and they are more likely to strike a deal.”Iran’s negotiating position was strengthened before the talks by the visit of the Saudi defence minister to Tehran to see the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The visit was intended as a message of solidarity that it opposes and would not collaborate in any US-Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear sites.The Omani foreign ministry said the goal of the talks was to reach “a fair, sustainable and binding agreement … to ensure that Iran is completely free of nuclear weapons and sanctions, while preserving its right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes”.Explore more on these topicsIran's nuclear programmeIran nuclear dealIranNuclear weaponsMiddle East and north AfricaRussiaOmannewsShareReuse this content"

More than 20 have fled abroad since being charged.Saied secureda second five-year term in 2024with 90.7% of the vote aftercoming to power in 2019. Rights groups say he has had full control over the judiciary since he dissolved parliament in 2021 and began ruling by decree. He dissolved the independent supreme judicial council and sacked dozens of judges in 2022.“We are not surprised by these unjust and vengeful verdicts that seek to silence the voices of these opposition figures,” Chaouachi’s son Youssef said“I have never witnessed a trial like this. It’s a farce, the rulings are ready, and what is happening is scandalous and shameful,” said defence lawyer Ahmed Souab on Friday before the ruling was handed down.Authorities say the defendants, who also include former officials and the former head of intelligence Kamel Guizani, tried to destabilise the country and overthrow Saied.“The authorities want to criminalise the opposition,” said the leader of the main National Salvation Front opposition coalition, Nejib Chebbi, on Friday. Chebbi was also among the defendants.Saied said in 2023 the politicians were “traitors and terrorists” and that judges who would acquit them were their accomplices.The opposition leaders involved in the case accuse Saied of staging a coup in 2021 and say the case is fabricated to stifle the opposition and establish a one-man, repressive rule.They say they were preparing an initiative aimed at uniting the fragmented opposition to face the democratic setback inthe cradle of the Arab spring uprisings.Most of the leaders of political parties inTunisiaare in prison, including Abir Moussi, the leader of the Free Constitutional party, and Rached Ghannouchi, the head of Ennahda – two of Saied’s most prominent opponents.Explore more on these topicsTunisiaMiddle East and north AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Elsewhere, the prevalent substances are tramadol, crack and – in a recent trend – kush,a deadly mixof cannabis, fentanyl, tramadol, formaldehyde andreportedly human bones. People who smoke it have been known to collapse, cause themselves bodily harm or even die.“People come here from the madrasa [Islamic schools] and tell us that scholars told them: ‘Take this, you will read well and quickly learn’,” Koumbassa said, referring to kush. “It actually destroys them.”The team first encountered kush in Conakry last March. Its use has now spread so much that patrons of nightclubs and lounges are known to be mixing it into shisha pots.View image in fullscreenDr Marie Koumbassa.Photograph: Eromo Egbejule/The GuardianUnlike its neighbours Guinea Bissau – seen as a “narco-state” – and Sierra Leone, which is the regional hub for kush, drug abuse and trafficking are not readily associated with the more culturally conservative Guinea. But experts say a crisis is under way, fuelled by a growing market operated by cross-border trafficking syndicates.“The gangs in Sierra Leone have always moved to Guinea [when necessary], said Kars de Bruijne, senior research fellow with Dutch thinktank Clingendael’s conflict research unit. “If a gang member committed a crime in Sierra Leone or was otherwise being looked for they would go to Guinea and hide out.“Similarly, we are aware of boats that sometimes move materials including drugs from Guinea to Sierra Leone. There’s really a lively cross-border informal trade.”Data about the drug abuse and trafficking situation is hard to come by, but according toa UNODC report, at least 5.6 tonnes of cocaine were seized off the coast of Guinea between January 2019 and June 2024. Earlier this year, Guinean authorities said theyfound seven suitcasescontaining suspected cocaine in a car belonging to the Sierra Leonean embassy.12:57Inside the war on kush: The drug ‘mixed with  human bones’ taking over Sierra Leone – videoStaff at SAJED say there is a serious lack of awareness about remedies and therapy. Still, the nonprofit has handled more than 500 cases since 2019, when Koumbassa opened the centre after returning inspired from workshops for psychologists in Abuja and Accra.“We have patients who come from everywhere, from within the country, as well as students returning from places like America and France,” said Yamoussa Bangoura, the centre’s head of psychotherapy. “We want to extend our operations to Boké [a city near Guinea-Bissau], and all the regions. But we don’t have the means.”Many factors are to blame for the drug epidemic, including poverty and porous borders. Some social workers think demonstrators against the junta that seized power in a coup in 2020 began taking drugs to give themselves the confidence to take to the streets. Some say the junta’s all-encompassing focus on holding on to power has distracted it from daily affairs of the state.The scale of the problem has overwhelmed Guinea’s meagre capacity for treating addicts. The country only has two known state-run centres catering to substance abuse. During the Covid-19 pandemic, one was closed for a time, overcrowding the other.SAJED’s own resources are extremely limited. It can only take around a dozen patients at a time.The facility is mostly funded by the people who worked there, but it also receivessmall grants from private donors and the sale of fruits within the compound that patients help water daily to keep them engaged. Sales of medication for treatment provides another source of revenue, but most of the patients are poor, so the clinic gives the medication to them for nothing.View image in fullscreenStaff at SAJED say there is a serious lack of awareness about remedies and therapy.Photograph: Eromo Egbejule/The GuardianRented from a member of the Guinean diaspora at a heavily discounted rate, the compound consists of a single-storey building with cubicles inside that serve as kitchen, laboratory and pharmacy. There is also a small emergency room and one bedroom each for men and women, as well as a common room with a TV.“People fear to come in sometimes because of the look of the building,” said Bangoura.People suffering from depression and alcohol addiction are also welcome at the clinic. One of those currently at the facility is Diallo Mahmoud, a 32-year-old whose alcohol addiction began as a teenager drinking with elders. Over the last three years, he moved to Abidjan and Brazzaville in search of work, drowning his failures in alcohol.After breaking a bottle on someone’s head in a fight at a Conakry nightclub, his siblings called SAJED. These days, he and other patients at the clinic discuss life together, anticipating a different direction when they are discharged.“After I leave here, I’ll not drink again and I’ll preach that to people,” Mahmoud said.Stories like his keep the clinic staff going, even when the road seems rough.“We have come to understand that drug consumption is recurrent in our homes, and the layer it consumes the most is the youth, the future of the nation,” said Koumbassa. “If we don’t help them get out of it, it will be a problem for the nation.”Explore more on these topicsGuineaAfricaDrugs tradefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The astronauts gave thumbs-up gestures as rescuers carried them from the spacecraft to an inflatable medical tent.Nasa said in a statement that Pettit was “doing well and in the range of what is expected for him following return to Earth”.He was then set to fly to the Kazakh city of Karaganda before boarding a Nasa plane to the agency’s Johnson Space Center in Texas.The astronauts spent their time on the ISS researching areas such as water sanitisation technology, plant growth under various conditions and fire behaviour in microgravity, Nasa said.The trio’s seven-month trip was just short of the nine months that the Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williamsunexpectedly spent on the orbital labafter the spacecraft they were testing suffered technical issues and was deemed unfit to fly them back to Earth.Space is one of the final areas of US-Russia cooperation amid an almost complete breakdown in relations between Moscow and Washington over the Ukraine conflict.Explore more on these topicsSpaceNasaRussianewsShareReuse this content"

He studied law at Cambridge but took a year out to care for his mother, who died of colon cancer aged 45. Weeks after her death, he successfully auditioned for Rada and went on to become a stage actor. His TV breakthrough came inAdrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years. He has since starred inGreen Wing,EpisodesandThe Split. He co-hostsLandscapeandPortrait Artistof the Yearon Sky Arts, and aweekly show on Classic FM. He is currently appearing in throuple comedyUnicornin the West End and is the author of six bestselling children’s books.His seventhis out in May.Your sister Anita illustrates your books. What’s it like working with a sibling?Great fun. Essentially we’re trying to make each other laugh, like we have done since childhood. But because I’m her annoying older brother, I deliberately put things in the book that are difficult to draw.Do you use yourthree sonsas a focus group?I use my 14-year-old as a plot consultant. If I’ve painted myself into a corner, I’ll have a chat with Frank. He’s very good at talking me through my logical inconsistencies. Then Jack, who’s now nine, reads a draft while I try not to be the person going: “What were you laughing at there? Why aren’t you laughing at this bit?”What things do you need to write?A lot of food and coffee. I come up to my office with a tray full of coffee, nuts and apples. Then I try not to stare out of the window, while eating like a demented squirrel. Acting is a team sport whereas writing is solitary, so it’s nice to yo-yo between the two.View image in fullscreenMangan with Annabel Scholey in The Split.Photograph: BBC/Sister PicturesYou’re approaching the end of your West End run inMike Bartlett’sUnicorn. Have you enjoyed it?I’ve loved it. It’s a play full of good ideas and great lines. Also Erin [Doherty] and Nicola [Walker, his co-stars] are two of the very best. They’re both so present on stage. Sometimes you work with actors who’ve worked out their performance in their bathroom at home and are going to give that performance come hell or high water. What’s lovely is that we all listen to one another and every night is genuinely very different. It’s great that a new play has done so well in the West End. And it feels absolutely contemporary.With three people in a bed, who goes in the middle? What happens if you have to get up to go to the loo?What’s been the audience reaction? Has it started conversations or inspired any “throuples”?We do get standing ovations at the end but we also get people leaving after 10 minutes because they weren’t expecting that nice couple fromThe Splitto be telling each other what they want to do in bed. I know people who’ve had uncomfortable taxi rides home afterwards. We’ve had throuples come to talk to us at the stage door. The other day, we had a bloke and two women who’d been together for 40 years. We’ve had three women who’d been together 20 years. In a way, I’ve got more questions for them than they have for me. You just want to know how it works. Even sleeping arrangements. With three people in a bed, who goes in the middle? What happens if you have to get up to go to the loo?Have you seenErin Doherty inAdolescence?I’ve put it off because we’re doing this play together and it would feel weird. As soon asUnicorn’s run finishes this week, I’ll sit down and watch it. Partly because Erin’s in it and Stephen Graham, who’s fantastic. But also because I’ve got three boys and I think it’s an important thing to watch.Who do you get more recognised as nowadays –Dan Moody fromI’m Alan Partridgeor Guy Secretan fromGreen Wing?I still get “Dan!” shouted at me several times per week. It tends to be Guy if I go near a hospital. Suddenly a lot of doctors emerge, wanting to tell me that he’s a hero to them, especially if they’re an anaesthetist. Which I’m not sure is terribly reassuring to hear [laughs].View image in fullscreenL-r: Erin Doherty, Nicola Walker and Stephen Mangan in Unicorn.Photograph: Marc BrennerWhat’s your dream role?I’ve been playing quite nice people or bumbling idiots lately, so I’d like to play someone really unpleasant. It’s always fun to exercise those bits of you.Would you like to play an Irish character?Yeah, I mean for goodness sake! Here I am, Mr Irish – even if I don’t look it. People think I’m a posh English boy, which in some ways I am. I had a posh English upbringing but my family background is entirely Irish. My mum was flame-haired, freckled Mary Donohoe.Your wife, Louise Delamere, is also anactor. How would you feel if your sons wanted to act professionally?Well, it’s given me a fantastic life. I’m forever grateful that I decided not to be a lawyer and became an actor instead. Why wouldn’t I want that for my children? Although of course you’re aware of how precarious it is and how buffeted by the winds of fortune you can be.How do you relax when you’re not working?I’ve had a Spurs season ticket since 1997. It’s been hellish this season. It’s like going to a huge group therapy session, where 60,000 people sit in a circle and try to examine what’s gone wrong in their life to bring them to this point. And I’m a big runner. A two-hour run is my meditation. I’m doing the London Marathon this week.What cultural things have you enjoyed recently?Like everyone else, I watchedThe White Lotus. My son sawA Complete Unknownand has become obsessed with Bob Dylan, so we’ve been ploughing through all the various Dylan documentaries. I listen to a lot of history podcasts and just readHelen Castor’s book on Richard II. In terms of fiction, I lovedThe Bee Stingby Paul Murray,Glorious Exploitsby Ferdia Lennon andTheMinistryof Timeby Kaliane Bradley.You play piano and were in a prog rock band at school. Do you secretly dream of rock stardom?I think all actors want to be rock stars. But the great thing about acting is you can still do it when you’re 80 and no one goes: “Why is he still doing that?”The Fart That Saved the Universeby Stephen Mangan, illustrated by Anita Mangan, is out on 8 May (Scholastic, £7.99).To support theGuardianandObserverorder your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Catalonia, to Ford’s mind, was “no place for the man of pleasure, taste or literature … here cotton is spun, vice and discontent bred, revolution concocted”. He found Valencians “vindictive, sullen, fickle and treacherous”, while reporting that the “better classes” in Murcia “vegetate in a monotonous unsocial existence: their pursuits are the cigar and the siesta”.Ford, whose often acid nib belied a deep love of all things Iberian, is one of 20 British authors profiled in a new Spanish book,Los curiosos impertinentes (“the annoyingly curious”), that explores the UK’s enduring fascination with Spain and reflects on how two centuries of travel writing have shaped the country’s image abroad.The book is prefaced by Ford’s pain quotation and by another, from the late Spanish writer Ramón J Sender: “There’s nothing like a foreigner when it comes to seeing what we’re like.”The writers selected by the book’s author, the British journalist and writer William Chislett, include Ford and his contemporary, the Bible salesman George Borrow, as well as some of their 20th-century successors, among themLaurie Lee, Gerald Brenan, Norman Lewis, VS Pritchett andRobert Graves. Authors from more recent decades are represented byMiranda FranceandGiles Tremlett, and by the late Michael Jacobs, to whom the book is dedicated.View image in fullscreenRobert Graves outside his house on the island of Majorca.Photograph: GRANGER/Historical Picture Archive/Alamy“I deliberately began in the 19th century with Ford and Borrow and didn’t go further back because I felt I had to start somewhere,” says Chislett, who has lived in Spain for almost 40 years. “One could regard Ford’s book as the first travel book … Then we skip forward to the 20th and 21st century for 18 other people, most of whom are absolutely unknown here, let alone in the UK.”The book, which was originally conceived of as an exhibition, is published by the Instituto Cervantes, the governmental organisation tasked with promoting the Spanish language and Hispanic culture.Chislett says there is no escaping the fact that all the books he cites “have forged an image” of the country that has shifted over the centuries.He points out that the old British idea of Spain as a dark, devout place – built on anti-Spanish propaganda and best summed up bythe austere majesty of El Escorial, Philip II’s monastery-cum-palace near Madrid – began to give way to something altogether more wild and romantic in the 19th century. In the aftermath of the peninsula war, Britons began to be seduced by Spain’s history, architecture and culture, and El Escorial had given way to the distant, Islamic splendours ofthe Alhambra in Granada.“It was unknown territory and had all these exotic elements,” adds Chislett. “Word got around that there were all these abandoned castles and flamenco … You’ve got these two contrasts: you’ve got the ‘black legend’ version of Spain and then you’ve got the romantic version of Spain.”Borrow and Ford were followed by Lee, who immortalised Spain on the cusp of civil war inAs I Walked Out One Midsummer Morningand by Lewis, whoseVoices of the Old Seacaptures a dying way of life in Farol, a profoundly superstitious village on the Costa Brava, as fishing gives way to mass tourism.The authors’ reflections also reveal that concerns over what is known today asovertourismare hardly new. Ford, who perhaps did more than most to put Spain on the tourist map, complained that the “implacable march of the European intellectual is crushing many native wildflowers”, while Pritchett later lamented that Spain had been “invaded by tourists”.Equally familiar, as Chislett and others mention, is Spain’s love-hate relationship with how it is viewed through foreign eyes. “Maybe Spaniards are prickly because so much has been written about them,” he says. “I haven’t come to any conclusion, but maybe you could say Spaniards – unjustifiably now, but maybe justifiably during the Franco regime – have an inferiority complex, which I like to think they’ve got rid of totally, given what’s happened over the last 50 years.“In many ways, Spain is way ahead of other European countries.”While Chislett describes the book as a “labour of love” and an attempt to repay Spain for its kindness and hospitality over the past four decades, he hopes it will also introduce Spanish readers to some of the great British travel writers. “There are books earlier than Ford and Borrow, going back to the 18th century,” he adds. “It’s about highlighting this tradition, which still goes on.”In his foreword to the book, the Spanish novelist and travel writer Julio Llamazares advises his compatriots to cast aside their “pride and patriotism” so that they might glimpse themselves anew in its pages.“It’s worth being prepared to accept the foreign gaze or, perhaps more accurately, the foreign gazes, given how many authors have written about us after touring our country and getting to know it,” he writes.“Like English-speaking Quixotes, they paint our portraits with their words, even as they demonstrate their passion for a country and a culture that, despite being so different to their own, has marked them forever and for life.”Explore more on these topicsTravel writingThe ObserverSpainSpain holidaysLaurie LeeRobert GravesGranada holidaysEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The family was celebrating Tim’s 20th birthday at their comfortable home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, after lunch in a restaurant. Tim’s mother went to answer the door, calling out as she did so that some of his friends must have arrived to wish him a happy birthday. Instead she found a group of men dressed in black waiting on the doorstep. Bellowing “FBI”, they barged their way into the house and handcuffed Ann and her husband, before marching them outside and driving them away.Alex assumed that there had been a terrible mistake; his parents were much too boring to warrant such a dramatic arrest. But there was no mistake. His parents were not Don Heathfield and Ann Foley, prosperous Canadians living in the US, but Andrei Bezrukov and Elena Vavilova, Russian spies who had assumed false identities before Alex and his brother were born. Together with their parents, the two boys were stripped of their Canadian citizenship and flown to Moscow. Alex was handed a Russian passport, identifying him with a name he could not even pronounce properly. “Typical high school identity crisis, right?” he remarks, with a wry smile but an undertone of understandable bitterness, while being interviewed by the author of this book,Shaun Walker, an international correspondent for theGuardianwho was based in Moscow for more than 10 years.This was an unnatural existence, one of constant strain, isolated from friends, family or home, sometimes for decadesAlex’s parents were products of a programme that dated back to the earliest days of the Soviet Union: planting agents in enemy countries who would live apparently normal lives while spying for the motherland. Such spies were known as “illegals”, to differentiate them from spies with diplomatic cover. The system originated with the pre-revolutionary Bolsheviks, who had operated clandestinely as an underground movement to evade capture by the tsarist secret police. After the Russian Revolution many hostile countries refused to recognise the new Soviet Union, which therefore had no embassies from which conventional spies could operate. These were the heroic years of the “great illegals”, who posed as European aristocrats, Persian merchants or Turkish students while spying on the capitalist enemy, using Bolshevikkonspiratsiya(“subterfuge”) to elude detection. This generation of illegals was wiped out in the purges of the 1930s. Stalin saw enemy illegals where none existed – he was especially suspicious of those who practised deception, though they did so for the communist cause, and he mistrusted or ignored much of the valuable intelligence that they presented to him.During the great oatriotic war, illegals once more became heroes of the Soviet Union, credited with assassinations of top Nazi officials. Then, in the cold war, the KGB selected individuals with outstanding language skills to undergo intensive training so that they might live undercover in enemy countries – principally, of course, the US. Typically, such illegals would assume the identity of someone who had died as an infant. Even in a nation of immigrants, posing as a native for any extended period was extraordinarily difficult, so they would usually be allotted a third nationality – Canadian, for example, or German. This was an unnatural existence, one of constant strain, isolated from friends, family or home, sometimes for decades. Husbands were separated from wives, and men and women allotted new partners from the pool of potential illegals. Couples were warned never to speak to each other in Russian, not even in their most intimate moments; one pregnant illegal feared that she might betray herself by crying out in Russian during labour. Many cold war illegals had no active role. They were known as “sleepers”, ordered simply to lie low and wait until their country needed them.View image in fullscreenElena Vavilova, AKA Ann Foley, in 1983.Photograph: Elena VavilovaIllegals received training in tradecraft familiar to any le Carré reader. A white chalk symbol on a lamp-post indicated that an illegal was ready to make a drop; a blue chalk mark on a bench signalled that a handler was ready to receive it. At any rendezvous illegals greeted their handlers according to a pre-arranged formula. A stranger approached one illegal operating in New York and asked: “Have you read any books by Elie Wiesel lately?” The illegal replied: “No, I have been reading Hemingway.” It would be hard to imagine a more stilted exchange.As Walker shrewdly observes, there was a paradox at the heart of the process. The Soviet Union was a closed society, which struggled to understand the west. The KGB wanted operatives who were intelligent, flexible and worldly enough to slip into the identity of a westerner, yet so ideologically firm as to withstand the strain of living undercover for years or even decades, while remaining oblivious to the increasingly obvious flaws in Soviet society. Many cracked under the pressure. After the collapse of communism some idealistic illegals returned to Russia dismayed by the changes they found. Was it for this that they had sacrificed so much?As part of his desire to restore Russian pride, Putin revived the cult of the illegals. He praised their “strong morals” and “firm character”. In his Russia the achievements of the illegals have been wildly exaggerated; in reality they produced little to justify the enormous effort necessary to train and sustain them, and Walker demonstrates that the meagre intelligence that they were able to gather was often ignored or poorly analysed. Nevertheless their strange lives make compelling stories. The author ends his very readable book by quoting from a recent interview with a western intelligence officer. How many illegals are still out there? asks Walker. “I’ll be honest with you,” his informant replies. “Nobody knows.”Adam Sisman’s most recent book is The Secret Life of John le Carré (Profile)The Illegals: Russia’s Most Audacious Spies and the Plot to Infiltrate the Westby Shaun Walker is published by Profile (£22).

What do you think I’ve been doing this whole time?”The incredulity seems fair. The 32-year-old Nigerian singer has been releasing work for more than a decade, running the gamut of genres from hip-hop to Afrobeat to experimental electronics to spoken word, alt-rock and soul. It has made him something of a critics’ darling, but if you’re not familiar with his solo music (his debut album, 2022’sSome Nights I Dream of Doors,was stunning), odds are you’ve heard his lithe, gravelly inflections on Richard Russell’sEverything Is Recordedproject, or warming up UK rap star Little Simz tracks such as 2021’s gloriousPoint and Kill, or sampled by super-producer du jour Fred Again on the 2023 behemothAdore U.The last of these, which interpolated vocals from Obongjayar’sI Wish It Was Me, was eye-opening for Umoh. Appearing on stage with Fred Again to perform the track, he saw how tens of thousands of people were responding to it in real time. It was “crazy”, he says, and invaluable. “Fred knows the crux of the song, the thing that’s going to hold you and shake you, and distils it down to that. And when you see how people relate to something, how it touches people, that’s when I started to get it.” The experience drove Umoh to reconsider what it meant to “write songs” – not as a newly commercial endeavour, but recognising that art should reach people. He comes up with an analogy about aliens needing to translate their language in order to be understood and have actual impact.Umoh is like this: pouring out long, thoughtful metaphors on the spot, gesticulating wildly, full of such sincere warmth and enthusiasm for, as he puts it, “yapping”, that he leaves the full English he ordered untouched for the entirety of our conversation – and then the ensuing photoshoot. At one point he’s waggling his hand in my face in the shape of a gun to reiterate how strongly he stands for his beliefs: “If you said you’d shoot me dead unless I said what you wanted me to say, I’d say, ‘Cool, kill me bro!’”He has not always been this exuberant. Back in Calabar, a port city in south-eastern Nigeria where he spent most of his childhood, Umoh was extremely shy. Aged six, his family laughed at his dream of performing songs to a huge crowd. It was Umoh’s grandmother, of whom he speaks fondly, who coaxed him out of his shyness. She was his main caregiver after his mum, a survivor of domestic violence, relocated to the UK while pregnant with his younger sister. Umoh recalls her encouraging him to be less afraid. “She said, ‘There’s no point. What’s the worst that can happen?’” he recalls. The notion stuck with him, and he now thinks of shyness as its own form of self-centredness: “The only person who really cares is you.”If it sells a million first week? Incredible. If it sells two pounds first week, it’s incredible tooToday, Umoh cuts a striking figure. He is tall, beaming, dressed in an “I heart London” T-shirt, lurid green sunglasses and bulky silver jewellery. “I’ve been awake since 3am,” is the first thing he announces as he takes a seat outside the Deptford cafe he has chosen for our interview, not too far from where he lives in south London. The sun is shining, and he suspects it’s his hay fever that’s been keeping him up. He is also on the precipice of releasing album number two,Paradise Now.It’sa glorious record of big songs, from gleaming pop numbers to strutting basslines to tender quasi-bossa-nova undercut by occasional west African grooves. This is all topped with a playful, Kate Bush-esque knack for the voice as its own instrument: yelping falsettos, silky crooning, seething growls, all woven together with his trademark honeyed sweetness. The album finds Obongjayar dwelling on family, the passage of time, relationships, faith, self, his anger at the British government. None of this is a cynical rehash of Adore U; instead, it seems the lesson Umoh has learned is to whittle further into himself, toying with the bones of classic song structures, repeating the mantra: “Of me, from me, for the world.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Pål HansenSurely knowing that people are about to hear the album has got to be at least somewhat stressful? “I know that I love the record,” he shrugs. “So my thinking is: it’s gonna come out and whatever’s gonna happen, it’s gonna happen. It’s like a fingerprint, it’s your voice – there’s nothing you can do about how people receive that. If it sells a million first week? Incredible. If it sells two pounds first week, it’s incredible too. I’m just in this place of contentment.” He likens the feeling to getting on stage. In live performances, Umoh exudes vibrancy, the music moving through him, a picture of confidence. “I know what I am, I know what I can do,” he says, “I wrote the songs, I love the songs – it came from me. So performing the songs is not this gigantic thing … it’s just me breathing.”Clearly, his grandma’s words have had an effect. By the time he was 17 and had moved to Ashford, Surreyto live with his mum, Umoh was uploading raps online, putting on an American accent. He went to university in Norwich, where he began to sing in his own voice, and it was not long after that his SoundCloud began to gain traction. Still, early 2000s hip-hop was his first love, and he points to the genre as an example of what all great art should aspire to do: “When people say that a lot of white people love hip-hop or whatever? [That means] it can translate to people who have nothing to do with that culture nor have any experience or understanding of it. That’s music that has had an effect on the world.”The Conservatives, Keir, it’s the same shit; they’re so spineless and it pisses me offUmoh does not shy away from politics in his music. His first album featuredMessage in a Hammer, a track about the 2020Lekki toll gate massacrein Lagos; onParadise Now,there’s Jellyfish, a scathing song about spineless British politicians. For Obongjayar, like his heroes Fela Kuti and Bob Marley, music having a message does not mean it has to be at the expense of a good tune. “I think there was a point where I was like …” he puts on an affected, earnest voice, “‘I gotta be conscious, bro, I gotta write stuff that’s gonna change the world!’” He laughs. “Nah man, I don’t think music operates like that, or that it has the licence to do that. Saying what you feel shouldn’t come at the cost of the music. If you’re trying to hammer in a message, you’re putting yourself in front of the thing and it becomes indulgent. If you shout at people, no one gives a shit.”Watch the video for Sweet Danger by Obongjayar.Jellyfish is an engrossing, high-energy rager with distorted staccatos of electronics and percussion. Only by listening closely will you hear lines like: “My heart is watermelon” and “Bomb bomb spawned by the stars and stripes”. For Umoh, this isn’t telling people what to think, but rather expressing his own anger. “Seeing how governments move, people in power, corporations – how for whatever monetary reasons you sell yourself,” he says, hitting the table for emphasis. “I was really pissed off with how spineless Britain was in response to Israel-Palestine. Waiting for America? Why are you being such a bitch, bro? You’re in a position where you can turn the tables, where you can say, ‘That’s fucked up, that’s wrong, we don’t stand for that.’ The Conservatives, Keir, it’s the same shit – they’re so spineless and it pisses me off.”On social media, Umoh is “Obongjayar, Devil Slayer”, but he says this is more about reckoning with his own demons. Umoh was raised as a Christian, and though he wouldn’t describe himself as such these days, his work and person is still imbued with spirituality. Album twofinds cries of “hallelujah!” and reflections on prayer – and, obviously, it’s calledParadise Now.He explains: “This isn’t about paradise as a destination. I think paradise is now, it’s here, this is part of it. Every moment is an opportunity to soak in beauty. It’s not taking ‘now’ for granted, it’s your relationship with yourself and the world around you.”For Obongjayar, success will be in his ability to communicate that sentiment through writing songs. As he says: “The most important part is being able to take my perspective on how I see the world and where I’m from, what my mind sees, and translate that vision into a language where everyone else can understand what it is. That’s peak artistry.”Paradise Nowis released on 30 May via September Recordings.

As the much-anticipated second season begins, they discuss growing up in the glare of fameSun 20 Apr 2025 03.01 EDTShareBella Ramsey self-recorded their audition tape forThe Last of Usat their parents’ home in Leicestershire and sent it off more in hope than expectation. Ramsey, who was 17 at the time, had never played the post-apocalyptic zombie video game on which the new TV series was based, but knew it was a big deal: released in 2013, it had sold more than 20m copies. It would later emerge that Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann, the show’s creators, looked seriously at more than 100 actors for the role of Ellie, the sassy and quirky but also complicated and vicious American protagonist ofThe Last of Us. “Yeah, I’ve been told,” says Ramsey with a wry smile.When Ramsey got the first callback from Mazin and Druckmann, they joined the Zoom from their childhood bedroom. “I’ve gotten very used to sending in a self-tape and forgetting about it,” they say, when we meet at a photo studio in north London. “But the problem was when there was a self-tape that really meant something to me, likeThe Last of Usdid. It feels quite scary. And when I got the phone call saying they wanted me to be Ellie it did feel surreal for a few days. I understood that if I said yes – which obviously I was going to – my life was going to change.”Life-changing is one way to describe it. Ramsey was hardly inexperienced when they were cast: their professional debut was aged 11 as the no-nonsense Lyanna Mormont inGame of Thrones; they had also been the star of the CBBC seriesThe Worst Witchand appeared in the BBC/HBO adaptation ofHis Dark Materials. ButThe Last of Uswas something else. About 40 million people watched the first episode in 2023 and the series, which is said to have cost $100m, became the most popular HBO show ever in Europe. Brutally violent at times, but also tender and poignant, the odd-couple chemistry between Ramsey’s Ellie and Pedro Pascal’s Joel has attracted an obsessive fanbase far beyond video-game nerds.I go out in my joggers, I go out in my ripped T-shirt that needs a wash. I’m sort of in denial about itRamsey, who has an uncompromising centre-parting, dark, doll-like eyes and bow lips, has in turn had to sacrifice a quiet life living with their folks in the Midlands. When their casting was announced, there was immediate and persistent criticism from fans of the video game that Ramsey didn’t look enough like Ellie. Ramsey, new to the attention and curious, sought out all the most hurtful comments. Then, during promotion for the series, Ramsey came out as nonbinary and said that the they/them pronouns were “the most truthful to me”. This generated more attention – perhaps more than was helpful for a teenager, they concede – and again became a hot topic with trolls already furious at the inclusion of LGBTQ characters in the games.Thankfully when the show aired, both it and Ramsey were manifestly excellent, and everyone moved on. “What makes Ellie so fascinating is that she has a lot of the fear and exuberance of a child, but also this strange, sad, heavy, beautiful wisdom and violence,” Mazin, the co-creator and co-writer, has said. “What you’re waiting for [in casting] is the person that makes it undeniable, where you’re like, ‘Oh, we’re done. Everything’s OK.’ And that was Bella.”View image in fullscreenRamsey and Pedro Pascal in a scene from The Last of Us season one.Photograph: APBut here we are again with season two. The first series followed Ellie and Joel as they travelled across an America infested with zombies; Ellie is immune to the Cordyceps fungus that causes the zombifying infection, and the suspicion is that she could be humanity’s saviour. But the season ended on a cliffhanger – spoiler alert! – with a lie Joel told Ellie that saved her anguish but maybe compromised the rest of the planet. Season two promises to reveal if Joel gets found out.Still, Ramsey has changed their mind on one aspect of the process: it doesn’t have to be life-changing after all. “With the release of season two, I’ve realised that there is a large element of it that’s out of my control – but a large element of it also is. Yeah, I’ve been still getting the tube. And just walking around. My day-to-day life hasn’t changed. I go out in my joggers, I go out in my ripped T-shirt that needs a wash. I’m sort of in denial about it. Or can’t comprehend it so just carry on as if nothing’s happened.”Do people think, I wonder, “That can’t beBella Ramsey, they’ve got a dirty T-shirt on”? They adopt a fashion pose: “Darling, I only go out in Prada.” (Today, for what it’s worth, Ramsey wears joggers, a blue sweatshirt, which appears to be freshly laundered, and trainers, all Adidas.)That could be a classic actor flex – “I still take the tube,” says the A-lister who last used public transport in 2004 – but you believe Ramsey. They come across as a funny and self-deprecating but basically pretty normal 21-year-old who happens to have landed on the biggest show on TV. “What I’ve realised is that you reach that level of fame for a few months, then people move on to the next thing, the next show. Now going into season two, I’m aware that it’s going to hype back up. I’m going to be more recognisable, people are going to want to talk to me a bit more for a couple of months. Then it’ll just die down again…”Ramsey pauses, lets out a long breath, perhaps a sigh, “Which is a really, really big relief.”It’s hard to believe, seeing that they have been doing it professionally for half their life, but Ramsey insists that they never set out to be an actor. Their parents were not in the industry, but dabbled in am-dram, and when Ramsey was four they joined their older sister in a local drama club, Stagecoach, in Loughborough. Their highlights reel from those days would have included roles as a monkey, a spoilt American brat and, in a breakthrough performance aged eight, the back half of a cow (their sister, pulling sibling rank, was the front) inJack and the Beanstalk. But aged 10, Ramsey applied to the Television Workshop, a drama group in Nottingham that helped to bring through Samantha Morton, Felicity Jones and Jack O’Connell. From there, they auditioned forGame of Thrones.View image in fullscreenAs Lyanna Mormont in Game of Thrones.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyWasn’t Ramsey nervous when they were cast? “Not nervous, because I hadn’t built it up in my head. Really, I’d never known that I’d wanted to be an actor. It wasn’t like this thing that I’d been dreaming of all my life.”On the set ofGame of Thrones, though, Ramsey loved it. They had struggled to make friends as a child; now, in adult company, something clicked. “It felt very natural. Immediately it felt like a place where I belonged, which I’d never felt anywhere else in my life, not at school, not in any of the millions of clubs I was a part of.”A much bigger deal for Ramsey was landing the lead, Mildred Hubble, inThe Worst Witch, which aired in 2017. “Because I watched CBBC,” they explain, “so I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, this is it.’” Ramsey was in the show for three seasons, shooting for 16 weeks each summer in Cheshire. Chaperones were not allowed, so Ramsey was away on her own, without a parent, Monday to Friday. “I was quite anxious as a kid anyway, and I was away from home for the first time,” they say. “I didn’t even go on a residential school trip before, because I didn’t want to be away from home.”At the end of the first season, Ramsey developed anorexia. They think now that it was down, in large part, to the stress of feeling that they had to set an example to the cast and crew. “Leading a show, you have the responsibility of that on your shoulders. There is a maturity that’s required of you that thankfully came quite naturally to me, but it’s just… it’s hard. It’s just hard.”Ramsey recovered from the anorexia with counselling, and those experiences have inspired them to write a film script, Toast and Jam (the title comes from what they ate each night to help them recover from the illness). The screenplay is about a 14-year-old girl with an eating disorder and Ramsey wants to direct it. “It’s finished,” they giggle. “I’ve finished it so many times, but now it’s finished-finished, ready-to-be-sent-out finished.”Talking to Ramsey, there’s a sense that they have experienced a lot,been througha lot, for someone so young. They agree: “There is now an element of me looking back and being like, ‘Oh, I was never a teenager.’ I do feel like I went from kid to adult. I had to show up on set every day and be responsible and have this very adult job.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s certainly a wild ride’: Ramsey, left, and Isabela Merced in the second season of The Last of Us.Photograph: HBOIt is perhaps not surprising that Ramsey has always found adult company easier than people their own age. But they have left home now and moved into a flat in London, so that is something they are working on. “Because I’ve grown up a lot with people much older than me, that is the dynamic that I’m really comfortable in and really good at,” says Ramsey. “Now, living in London, I’ve got a small group of friends who are my age – for the first time, really. That’s been a really, really positive thing of letting go of the shy, loner kid inside of me. Honouring that part of me, but also being, ‘No, I can get along with people my age! And I do like hanging out with you, and you like hanging out with me, which is maybe even crazier.’”Something that has bolstered Ramsey in recent times is being diagnosed as neurodiverse. The process started in January 2023, when they were shooting the first season ofThe Last of Us. “Someone on set just assumed that I was autistic,” they recall. “They had a kid who was and were like, ‘You are, right?’ And I was like, ‘Whoa!’ I’ve always thought that maybe I was, but I thought I’d sort of been making it up. Then I went through the whole diagnostic process. And it turns out I am, which has been so helpful for me. Like, every day.”I never had the experience as a kid of friendly fighting with friends so it felt like I was living a childhood dreamNeurodiversity also helps to explain why Ramsey has been drawn to acting. They are certainly not a method actor; their approach is much looser. In 2022, they starred in the Lena Dunham-directed filmCatherine Called Birdy, about a headstrong 14-year-old girl in 13th-century Lincolnshire. “I learned about the 1200s, but really specific things,” they say. “Like what everyday life was like, what it would be like to be a peasant. I don’t really know the big events that happened. My prep for everything is just to make it feel like I’m not acting really. Make it feel like I’m immersed in this world, and I’d know what I’d be doing at lunchtime or stuff.”For Dunham, Ramsey’s versatility gives them the ability to play almost anything. “Bella reminds me of Tilda Swinton inOrlando,” the director toldVogue, which featured Ramsey on the April cover. “[They have] that ability to shapeshift and become new in front of your very eyes. They have a quality that is both modern and totally timeless. They’d fit as easily at a rave in Dalston as in a Renaissance court.”Because of not going to school during her teenage years – Ramsey studied online at King’s InterHigh and has followed it up with courses on environmental science from the Open University – they accept they have some gaps in their knowledge. Instead, acting has bestowed them with more esoteric talents such as horse-riding and broadsword fighting. “Medieval skills,” Ramsey says. “You never know when the medieval times are going to come again. And when they do, I’ll be ready.”Nothing quite so left field was required for the new season ofThe Last of Us. Ramsey did a lot of physical training and Brazilian jujitsu sessions to make it convincing that someone 5ft 1in could fend off hordes of snarling zombies. “You are always sore,” they say. “But it was a really nice thing for me to do grappling and fighting. Because I never had the experience as a kid of friendly fighting with friends. So it felt like I was living a childhood dream.”View image in fullscreenPortrait by David Vintiner.Ramsey is intensely proud of the new series. “The second season, there was definitely an expectation and pressure to live up to the first one,” they say. “But everyone’s goal was not to live up to it, but to surpass it. And I feel pretty confident in the fact that people are going to be really happy.” Ramsey stops, and seems to scroll through how the episodes unfold. “Well, I wouldn’t say happy, actually. More just emotionally traumatised and shocked. It’s certainly a wild ride.”A main thread in the new season is Ellie’s relationship with Dina, played by Isabela Merced.The Last of Usis a progressive show – there are gay characters, and this series introduces Lev, a trans teenager – and Ramsey believes that can have a powerful impact in introducing a mainstream audience to queer storylines. “On set, there’s no having to hide or feel like you’re out of place,” they say. “Everyone feels like they belong working on the show, and hopefully as a viewer as well.”How does Ramsey feel about their decision to come out as non-binary? “Part of me looks back and I wish that I didn’t, because I didn’t want it to become a headline and a big thing,” they say. “And obviously it was going to, and I didn’t really understand that at the time. And I wasn’t really prepared for that. But on the other hand, people have said to me that it’s been very helpful for them seeing some representation.“So it’s been a mixed bag, but overall, I think it was a good thing, just for me living more freely, without feeling like I’m keeping a secret,” Ramsey goes on. “But now I’m like, ‘I’ll talk about it, but I don’t want it to be the focus any more.’ I guess I’m just quite chill with it. And I want everyone else to be as chill with it basically.”The Last of Us review – one of the finest TV shows you will see this yearRead moreRamsey seems to be in a good place; not long before we meet they deactivated their Instagram account. Part of the inspiration was the actor and director Jesse Eisenberg, whom Ramsey worked with on the 2020 war dramaResistance, and Kit Harington fromGame of Thrones. “Those are the two actors who I just thought were the coolest people to ever walk the earth, and neither of them had social media,” Ramsey says. “I remember them just being so normal and funny and interesting. They were famous because they were great at something, not because they were celebrities. They never pushed themselves out there and made themselves more famous.”Watch a trailer for season two of The Last of Us.Ramsey had never planned to have a social-media presence: they started their Instagram account initially because there were fake accounts pretending to be them. “The problem was that I did sort of enjoy it,” Ramsey admits, with a grin. “I’m so susceptible to the dopamine hits of scrolling, I’d lose sleep just scrolling on Instagram. And I didn’t need that in my life any more.”As for the future, a third season ofThe Last of Ushas already been announced. They want to write, direct, but really, seeing as they are still only 21, anything feels possible. Mainly, though, they want to keep acting, exploring their limits there. “If I passed away on a film set, I’d be happy,” says Ramsey, as we part. “I would like to be acting until my last breath, for sure.”The Last of Usis on Sky Atlantic and NowExplore more on these topicsBella RamseyThe ObserverThe Last of UsGame of ThronesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But when mediated through screens, his connection to his fans is palpableNathan EvansSun 20 Apr 2025 09.47 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Apr 2025 09.48 EDTShareCentral Cee has exported UK rap like no one else before, by sculpting UK drill for TikTok with fast-paced, bite-sized packaging that often remixes a recognisable hit, all sealed with his steely demeanour. An influential fashion figure and Gen Z icon, his success is global and previously inconceivable. His 2023 hitSprinterwith Dave sat in pole position in the charts for 10 consecutive weeks. The crowd at Co-Op Live arena reflects his youth appeal all the way down to primary-schoolers. But while the squealing girls and balaclava-wearing boys have their fun, sometimes it feels as though the rapper is too reticent to join in.Arenas aren’t suited to reserved characters, but Cench, as his fans call him, is smart enough to match the Co-Op’s scale. He stands in front of a multitiered structure that, using screens, becomes an open dollhouse that tells the story of his come-up through the key places in his life, from his family home to his new pad. Unwinding into tracks from his initial mixtapes, his barbed flow rolls like a series of verbal jabs: “Your dad left home from young / And you ain’t done shit for your mum, ah man,” he berates on his breakout 2021 singleDay in the Life.There being 20,000 pairs of eyes on him occasionally produces some wonderfully human moments that overcome his persona. However, if his tracks follow a formula, his performance on stage is no more mercurial. He sticks to a stiff set of hand gestures as if he’s cycling through Fortnite emotes, and when guest verses are often played in their entirety, he’s left clueless as to what to do on stage.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Katja Ogrin/RedfernsThere are no issues vocalising on the mic though. He is just as cosy traversing the Brazilian funk rhythm of CRG as he is the sepulchral atmospheres knocking with doom-stricken gunshot snares on St Patrick’s. On an island stage, he flirts through Me & You in a black tank top and glittered snapback. Some people record on Snapchat, others resort to launching their phones on to the stage in the hopes of getting a photo from the social media king. His onscreen connection with fans defines the show, as he performsGen Z Lovethrough a live FaceTime with fans at the barricades. “If it weren’t for the algorithm, I wouldn’t have found my woman,” he raps to the phone.Central Cee: Can’t Rush Greatness review – conflict and contradiction underpin justly confident rap debutRead moreCench’s biggest solo hits are thoroughly optimised to clock in at under two minutes, but on his debut album Can’t Rush Greatness, he shoots for longer, verse-heavy tracks. So while tracks such as Doja are met with an almost unholy chorus of screams, the moment is over far quicker than tracks like Now We’re Strangers, which are greeted with a more polite response. The show concludes with Cench hopping back in his Yaris, revealing the whole show to be a dream. If only we could relive the highlights some more.At theO2, London, on 24 April andOvo Hydro, Glasgow, on 27 AprilExplore more on these topicsCentral CeeRapHip-hopDrilllive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.For so many years Devon was viewed as the poorer relation to Cornwall; its coastline less rugged and epic, its beaches smaller, less elemental. For us, the county was always just a cut-through to the treasure beyond and never a destination in itself. The fact that Cornwall was much further to get to somehow proved its remoter superiority. How wrong we were.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.North Devon, in particular, is having a moment. Its 30km coastline is the UK’s first World Surfing Reserve, joining Australia’s Gold Coast and California’s Malibu and Santa Cruz as one of 12 officially chosen. Move over Newquay and Fistral beach.But even if you’re not a surfer, north Devon beaches easily compete with Cornwall’s finest. Our first stop is Woolacombe and what takes us by surprise is the sheer scale of it. An epic expanse of golden sand – quarter of a mile wide at low tide and two miles long – under a dome of bright blue sky framed by undulating green hills. And not a development in sight, thanks to the National Trust which owns the surrounding area.Woolacombe itself is less gentrified than your Padstows or Polzeaths, certainly, but all the more charming for it. The affluent second-home-owners are refreshingly absent and it’s much less expensive, too. There’s no chance of paying £16.95 for Rick Stein’s cod and chips here.View image in fullscreenThe harbour at Ilfracombe.Photograph: Westend61/Getty ImagesWe stop for lunch instead at Fudgies Bakehouse, close to the seafront, where you can feast on fresh pasties and homemade ice-cream for less than a tenner a head, followed by beers at Bar Electric with a sun terrace and views across the beach.Our base for the week is Willingcot, a collection of timber-clad eco homes in a lush green valley two miles inland from Woolacombe. Perfect for families, there’s acres of space, a contemporary open-plan sitting room and kitchen area with outdoor decking and seating where you can watch the children explore the expanse of greenery it’s set in.Close to the house is a bridle path that used to be the old railway line; cutting through pretty countryside, it’s handy for cycling or walking to all the local bays. We follow it into Ilfracombe, less gentrified than Croyde and noticeably less busy than Woolacombe, but worth a visit for its Victorian harbour and, depending on your taste, Damien Hirst’s striking 66ft-high sculpture,Verity, a pregnant woman with sword raised high, her exposed skull and foetus clearly visible. For tea and cake, and splendid views across the harbour, the Lime Kiln café is a handy pit stop.Fifteen minutes down the road is Braunton with a pleasant high street lined with boutiques and cafés. Beyond the village, you can follow the river Caen from Velator Quay with views across Braunton Burrows, a Unesco biosphere reserve due to the rarity of plant and insect life here. You may well spot, as we did, a large and rather hostile-looking herd of cattle, whose grazing helps maintain the dunes’ natural habitat.The next day we strike out for nearby Putsborough, taking a path from the beach up to the top of the hill and then following the South West Coast Path high above the sea. A patchwork of green fields stretches out behind us and either side is the glittering, panoramic sweep of the ocean as we head around the rocky headland of Baggy Point. We end up at Croyde, another bay that’s a surfer’s paradise, although the chief draw for us after a long trek is a pint in the much loved local pub, the Thatch.View image in fullscreenSea views from the South West Coastal Path.Photograph: Victoria Ashman/Getty Images/iStockphotoOn our final day we walk from Mortehoe village to Morte Point where waves crash over the deadly “devil’s teeth”; craggy rocks that have been responsible for many shipwrecks down the centuries. Nowadays you’re more likely to spot seals in these choppy waters – we saw several frisking in the waves below us.After a long trek back to Willingcot, the biggest treat is a glass of wine in the outdoor hot tub, the perfect antidote for blisters and aching limbs after a blustery walk around the headland.Luxury Coastal (luxurycoastal.co.uk) offers seven nights at Willingcott from £728 (sleeps eight), including a welcome hamper.

I got weekends off and on one of those occasions I met a girl called Marie. During that lovely early period of a new relationship where you’re still getting to know each other, I took her camping at Mount Buffalo in Victoria.On the way home we stopped in Myrtleford, a small town at the foot of the mountain, to get petrol. I fuelled up and Marie stayed in the car while I went inside to pay.I was in my early 20s at the time and wasn’t earning money because I’d been caring for my grandmother, so I deliberately put only $20 worth of petrol in the tank. But when I went to pay, my card was declined. This was a time before mobile phones, so I couldn’t call someone else to ask them to put money in my account. I’d have to ask Marie for the money, which I couldn’t face. I vividly remember looking out at her sitting in the car and feeling utter panic wash over me. I was trying to impress her – we weren’t yet a sealed deal. What was I going to do?The kindness of strangers: I was ready to leave the theatre in disgrace when a gentle usher made me an offerRead moreBehind the counter was a young fella, maybe a couple of years younger than me. He just had this incredible read on the situation I was in. Very quickly, without any fuss, he went and got his backpack, took out his wallet and said, “Mate, I’ll pay for the fuel. When you get the money, just post it back to me care of the petrol station.”Of course, I politely declined and said I couldn’t possibly take his money. But he insisted, saying he understood that sometimes this happens. He seemed to have a wisdom beyond his years.When I got back in the car, I said nothing to Marie – the shame was real. But on the drive home I silently committed to getting that $20 back to him as soon as I could, and I did. Back then, $20 felt like a huge amount of money, as it does when you’re young. The cashier was probably working there part-time while finishing school, so I’m sure it was a lot of money for him too.In the years after, whenever I was in the area, I always drove past that petrol station hoping to bump into him again. I never did. But it was a lovely bit of male-to-male camaraderie for this fella to surmise the situation and want to save me that embarrassment. There was this mutual understanding between us of the horror of my predicament.For him to so generously offer me that money had a big impact on me, and made me want to be a better person. I’m still touched and amazed by it.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceWhat's the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?From making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Starters £4-£16; mains £12-£33; wine from £35I am a potentially dull person to eat with. However much I love and relish food, food is not my friend and I have a host of verbotens,ranging from garlic, onion and chives, which for me are headache-inducing, to butter, which I have always hated. Each meal in a new restaurant where I’m not familiar with the idiosyncrasies of the menu begins, “Do you have anything without garlic?” My meal might end up seeming plain to an onlooker, but this plainness divulges so many nuanced flavours – a grilled chop floods my nervous system with relaxing endorphins. The pleasure of eating something that agrees with me is in itself a huge delight.View image in fullscreen‘Somehow cloudlike’: raw scallop, finger lime, chicken salt, potato cakePhotograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverOffered the chance to be a restaurant critic for a day, my first thought was who would be the most fun to invite as my date. A sadly long-departed film producer friend calledHercules Bellville– Hercy – pronounced that the most important thing about a restaurant was the amount of space between the tables. In his book, food came about third on the list. I agree in part – for me the thing that matters most is the atmosphere.But my number one priority is who I get to converse with, and how much they will enjoy all the things denied to me that I can vicariously experience. For the last 10 years I have been going for lunch with the brilliant fashion journalistTim Blanks. He has taken me for birthday lunches at our local Japanese. We have discussed music, fashion and politics in great detail. He normally drinks the most fabulous-sounding concoctions while I benefit from the contact high.View image in fullscreen‘Insanely good; feather-light’: potato pizzette with mortadella.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverTim accepted my offer of lunch at chef-ownerJackson Boxer’s new restaurant Dove on Ladbroke Grove’s Kensington Park Road in London, which opened in early January; we were already fans of its previous incarnation, the seafood restaurantOrasay, which occupied the same spot and closed on New Year’s Eve 2024. Someone told me that Dove has this incredible burger on the menu made from 50-day dry-aged beef, with gorgonzola on top. They only make something like 15 portions per day and they sell out within minutes. We missed them, but there were other tantalising delicacies to deliberate over.Tim and I usually dawdle for hours, analysing the most recent fashion gossip and the current switcheroo creative director merry-go-round. He had to rush off sooner than usual to get an exclusive phone scoop direct from Haider Ackermann on his Tom Ford debut, so we ordered fast. A few weeks earlier Tim tripped on a tiny kerb differential and somehow managed to break his arm in three places and smash a few ribs. He started the meal with a glass of Château Cantemerle, a Bordeaux that doesn’t usually come by the glass and was one of the “Weekly Specials Pours By Glass” – so that was nice. I opted for a non-alcoholic drink called Jin Jin with lime and soda, which was slightly sweet and vinegary, which is something I adore and find delicious.View image in fullscreen‘Out of this world’: grilled wild sea bream with confit garlic and guindilla peppers.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverThemenuat Dove is inventive with unusual combinations, which are tantalising even for me who is wary of too much artistry in cooking. Writing this a few hours later I wish I had ordered more dishes, but to start I opted for raw scallop, finger lime, chicken salt, potato cake.Tim chose fried-potato pizzette, bonito, burrata, mortadella, but without the mortadella as he doesn’t eat meat, and I don’t like mortadella. Both of these starters were so light, with flavours that kept emerging and multiplying with every tiny bite. The potato bases of both were fried, but somehow cloudlike in their enhancing functions as a base. My morsels of scallops on top of the finger lime were so moreish and each taste was both exquisite and balanced, like an orchestral composition. What was relaxing, too, was the lack of annoyance or resistance we met with when asked to remove things like the mortadella from the potato pizzette, which was insanely good even without it: rich in taste and feather-light to consume.View image in fullscreen‘So much charm’: fior di latte soft serve with olive oil, and oat cookies.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverFor our main we went for grilled wild sea bream, confit garlic (which I didn’t touch) and guindilla peppers for two. Looking around, I spied bowls of chunky-looking duck fat fries, so we ordered them, too, with a bitter leaf salad. The sea bream arrived, opened and flat with its head flattened like a hammerhead shark. The addition of a few elegant guindilla peppers scattered over it turned it into a scene from a meal inBreaking Bad. This fish was out of this world, so fresh and light it fell off under the fork, which was good for Tim’s left-hand manoeuvring. It was so tasty and flavoursome that we barely bothered with the chips (unheard of). The bitter leaf salad was as high class an arrangement of leaves as you could get, but again the fish… Tim said the confit garlic didn’t really add anything, but it was because the bream didn’t need anything.For pudding we both orderedEstate Dairyfior di latte soft serve, early harvest olive oil, oat cookies and a coffee cardamom caramel cream to share. The fior di latte ice-cream arrived like two Mr Whippy’s, with a light sheen of pale olive oil adorning its ripples like tiny rivulets. It almost didn’t matter what it tasted like, it had so much charm – though it was daintily appetising and freezing, accompanied by warm, just-baked oatmeal cookies. The pièce de résistance was the tiny little bomb of flavour that was the coffee cardamom caramel: sweet but not sweet, the texture like a memory from a 19th-century novel. It hit the heart and woke up your appetite all over again. It made you crazy with desire. That is a real art in cooking.View image in fullscreen‘Texture like a memory from a 19th-century novel’: cardamon caramel cream.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverThe food at Dove is amazing. The décor is simple and elegant; light floods in from the windows at the front, and further in there is a roof light that makes for soft, flattering, European-style ambience. The staff who work there are attentive, efficient, friendly and no one asked us whether we were enjoying our meal.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe ObserverRestaurants (Food)Restaurants (Travel)reviewsShareReuse this content"

It is also a foodie delight. The Jolly Fisherman (thejollyfishermancraster.co.uk) is ideally placed to enjoy the sea views. In its airy conservatory at the back of the pub, you can tuck into a feast of fresh fish on the daily menu, including crab, North Sea prawns, moules frites, salmon &and haddock fishcakes. Outside the pub, you’ll notice a distinctive smoky aroma, no surprise as the shop opposite, L Robson & Sons, is home to the kipper, smoking fish on its site since 1856 and now awarded grade 11-II listed status.2Chances are that a stay in Northumberland will include rain, which is when Bamburgh Castle (bamburghcastle.com) really comes into its own. Less overrun with tourists than Alnwick, it’s also cheaper. Overlooking an epic sweep of beach and perched above the sand dunes, this 900-old castle has 14 rooms to explore, from the medieval kitchen to the Victorian Kings Hall, along with a fascinating history from its Norman origins to the current family living there.View image in fullscreenFishing pots stacked at Craster harbour.Photograph: Alamy3Idyllically pretty Warkworth village is the perfect base for exploring the coastline, with a quaint high street, regency cottages and a castle on the hill. It’s also a 15-minute walk to a stunning beach. Along this vast, sandy – and surprisingly empty – sweep of coastline you’ll find neighbouring Alnmouth, another picturesque village with dunes and grassland overlooking the bay. Head for Main Street with its cosy tearooms and pubs; a local favourite is the mahogany panelled Red Lion Inn, although the fresh crab sandwiches at Bistro 23 are well worth a detour, too (bistro23.co.uk).4For something distinctly less quaint, more mysterious and otherworldly, head to Holy Island. The drive across the causeway is reason enough to visit – the narrow strip of land, submerged by sea during high tide, is flat, desolate and eerily beautiful. There’s much else besides; the 12th-century Lindisfarne priory, the epicentre of Christianity in Anglo Saxon times, and Lindisfarne castle perched on a rocky plateau. Don’t miss Pilgrims Gelato, part of the Oat Kitchen on the main street (theoatkitchen.co.uk), with homemade vegan ice-cream and sorbets well worth the regular queues.View image in fullscreenLindisfarne Priory, founded by St Aidan in AD635.Photograph: Gannet77/Getty Images5Hadrian’s Wall stretches 73 miles coast to coast, from the River Tyne in the east to the Solway Firth in the west. Inland, Steel’s Rigg near Sycamore Gap, has some of the best views along the wall, including ancient Roman ruins and a glacial lake. For a treat at the end of your walk is the Twice Brewed Inn (twicebrewedinn.co.uk) – their Sycamore Gap pale ale and fishfinger sandwiches are highly recommended.6Stay at the Old Stables, nestled in the curve of the River Coquet and right next to Warkworth’s bucolic church green. It is stylishly restored and converted with exposed brick and double-height kitchen giving it a loft-style feel.

Two years ago, I admitted to an affair, texting sex workers, watching porn and checking out women in public. I was not upfront with my wife and it badly affected her self-worth. Since then, I have been in therapy and some childhood issues have come to light around secrecy, lying and feeling unlovable. But I take responsibility for my actions. We have also done couples’ counselling and spent two difficult years working through it all while raising the family.In recent months, things have been better. Trust has been rebuilding, we’ve felt closer andthe future felt hopeful. But last week she caught me looking at a woman on the street in a way that upset her. I lied about it at first, then admitted it later. It reopened all the old wounds and I’m angry at myself for repeating the same damaging behaviours around dishonesty and ogling.She now says she plans to leave me when the children finish school in two years unless I can show her I’ve really changed. She says she doesn’t care what I do in that time because it’s how she protects herself. I feel anxiousthat we’ll drift further apart as she shuts down.Should I respect her need for distance and trust that change might shift something for us both? Or are we better off ending the relationship now so I can do the work independently without hurting her more?Philippa’s answerYou say you feel anxious and unsteady, I can understand that. You have worked hard to rebuild trust after doing significant damage to your relationship. The two of you have invested a great deal in trying to repair what was broken and just as things were beginning to feel better you broke the agreement again.You know this. You have already said as much. What you are now facing is the consequence of that. Not the punishment, but the consequence. Your wife has taken a step back to protect herself. She has said she doesn’t care what you do. That sounds like she is withdrawing emotionally in order to manage the pain. You say you feel anxious this will lead to further distance and disconnection. That is possible. But this is not something you can control. Your job now is not to manage her feelings but to focus on your own behaviour. That includes facing what happens in the moment you are confronted. That is where the damage often lands. You looked. Then you lied. That pattern is familiar to you. You say you are angry at yourself and want to change. That is the work in front of you.She has set out what she needs in order to feel safe. It might help to take her at her word. Not in the sense of treating the two years like a probation, or trying to convince her of anything, but by continuing to work on yourself without the expectation of a guaranteed outcome. If she sees change, she might stay. If not, she might not. Either way, the changes you need to make are about you becoming the partner – and the person – you would rather be. Not just for her, but for yourself, too.You seem to find it hard to live with an uncertain future, but clarity is not something you are owed at this momentYou also ask whether it would be better to separate now so that you can do this work alone. It sounds like you find it hard to live with an uncertain future. It may be that your anxiety is pushing you to seek clarity, one way or another. But clarity is not something you are owed at this moment. You have hurt someone who trusted you and who took a risk to rebuild something with you. She has pulled away as a way of managing her own safety. It is not easy, but it is understandable.You might also find it helpful to seek support that goes beyond individual therapy. There are groups such asSex Addicts Anonymousthat offer structured peer support for those struggling with compulsive sexual behaviours, including pornography and affairs. Exploring more of your own relationship with sex and intimacy in therapy might also help. This is not about shame. It is about understanding your patterns and making space for something different.I recommend doing some research about how trust is rebuilt after betrayal, and how habitual behaviours can be understood and changed.Out of the Doghouseby Robert Weiss is written for men who want to rebuild trust after infidelity. If compulsive patterns around sex and secrecy are part of what you are addressing,Your Brain on Pornby Gary Wilson explores how certain behaviours take hold and what it takes to shift them. Neither book replaces therapy, but both can help you make sense of what has happened and support you.Whether the two of you stay together or not, change that is genuine will serve you. You are not powerless here. The relationship may or may not survive, but the work on your integrity, your truthfulness and your awareness is yours to do.Every week Philippa Perry addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.If you would like advice from Philippa, please send your problem toaskphilippa@observer.co.uk.

Then it shatteredStephen MarcheSun 20 Apr 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Apr 2025 12.57 EDTShareView image in fullscreenThe first impression America gave me was gentle carelessness. We were driving down fromCanadato visit family friends in Texas sometime in the mid- to late 1980s, and a young border patrol agent at a booth, crouched over a newspaper, leaning back in his chair, carelessly waved my family’s station wagon across without looking up. You didn’t even need a passport to enter the United States until I was 33.You need clear eyes at the border today. Europe and Canada have issued travel advisories after a series ofarbitrary detentions, deportations to foreign jails without due process and hundreds of valid visaspulledorvoidedamid a sense of general impunity. While I have crossed the border a hundred times at least, sometimes once a month when I lived there, I cannot say when I will see America again, and I am quite sure I will never return to the country I once visited.The America I knew, the America I loved, has closed.And so I find myself like a man who has been admiring bubbles floating in the air, trying to recall their shape and swerve and shine after they’ve popped.America was a country of bubbles. I loved it as one loves anything that is both real and fantastical.Donald Trumphas blown himself into a bubble of gilded ceilings,ersatz Roman murals, sycophants on tap and midnight rants of imperial conquest on personally owned social media networks. He is only one story. America was millions of bubbles. For some reason, I find myself remembering Tom Waits in a junkyard making Bone Machine, turning rusted fenders and tossed-out dry cleaners and cracked sheet metal into a scrap marimba of his own invention. Even its dumps could give birth to magic.Golf course palaces and wrecking-lot percussion: twin American truths.You felt the meaning of America the moment you entered. In Canada, wilderness is wilderness. The northern forests I come from resist interpretation; that is their power. But when you cross the border from, say, Quebec into Maine, you can feel myth accruing around the bark of the trees. You are in the haunted forests of New England, redolent with burned witches and ghost stories. Further south, the foggy murderous oaks loom gothically. Out west, the deserts beg for cowboys to cross them. Canada is a country that disillusions you. America is one illusion after another, some magnificent, others treacherous or vicious.That is a big feeling among the most successful people in America: the sense of being ripped offEvery landscape in America is setting, and you have to pose inside them. In my 20s, I drove Highway 1 from San Francisco to Los Angeles. An older and wiser friend told me to rent a convertible, and I laughed the suggestion off, since it felt like something you would do in the movies. Huge mistake. That drive down theCaliforniacoast – cows by the big-wave Pacific, condors in the clefts of Big Sur – demands an open roof.I learned then: when you go to America, always pick the option that feels like what you would do in the movies.In San Francisco, right by the Yahoo offices on Mission Street, was a small homeless encampment. I could just see inside one of the tents through an open flap, where a boy – he would have been about 10 years old – was playing with little treasures on a small tray – a ring, a toy car, a key chain. Even the tents of the homeless were little bubbles.In Malibu, at a sushi bar, elegant Japanese surf bums lounged between orders, watching Game 7 of the World Series, languidly curling out cucumber spirals the chefs used instead of seaweed. That was their thing – cucumber-based rolls. That restaurant is ash now.View image in fullscreenSurfriders state beach park in Malibu, California, in 1965.Photograph: Jonathan Blair/Corbis/Getty ImagesSometimes, you can see the bubbles better from the air. Flying into Palm Springs, the desert circumscribed, encroaching, revealed the furious machinery working to push it away. Palm Springs is pure delight on the ground: the misted pools, the cocktails filled with the exactly the right ice shapes, the street names hanging on to the faded glamour of the tacky talkshow guests from half a century ago.The airport has no roof; that’s how crazy a city it is. A glistening shivering bubble, effortless once inside.The sheer prosperity of the country could be breathtaking. I had just come back from Senegal when the Guardiansent me on assignment to Rust belt Ohio, during the first stirrings of Trumpism, back in 2015. I was there to report on the growing swell of populism by way of the postindustrial immiseration of middle America.I was stopping for gas on the way to a rally, and at the station they were selling a hotdog with as much chilli and cheese as you liked for $1.99. The chilli and cheese came out of the wall. You pressed two buttons, one for chilli and one for cheese.On the streets of Dakar, children hawk packs of peanuts and plastic bags of clean water on the street, and I wondered if you could even explain to them that there existed a place, on the same earth, where chilli and liquid cheese came out of a wall, and you could have as much of it as you liked for the equivalent of 20 minutes’ work at the minimum wage, and that some of the people in that place considered themselves so hard done by that their resentful fury threatened the political order, that they just wanted to burn it all down.The next US civil war is already here – we just refuse to see itRead moreIt was more than money and grandeur, though. The openness, the generosity of ordinary people, floated free over the country.When I was researching my bookThe Next Civil War, the far-right people I met, the militia folks, in Oklahoma and in Ohio, at gun shows and Trump rallies and prepper conventions, were, without exception, polite in person – no doubt because I’m white, with blond hair and blue eyes, so I can pretend to be a good ol’ boy when required. They lived in dark bubbles, bubbles of serpentine paranoia and weird loathings and strange fantasies of breakdown.They welcomed me into their bubbles as equably as concierges. Militia pie is delicious; the crusts are richer, flakier. I think they use lard. Anyway, they talked to me about their hopes for the destruction of their government cheerfully and frankly, because they were living the movies playing in their minds and they wanted me to witness the projection.At one prepper convention I remember, a vendor was selling gluten-free rations for bunker survival. That was America in a bucket to me: even at the end of the world, don’t let a gluten allergy interfere with your active lifestyle.View image in fullscreenWrigley Field in Chicago in 1988.Photograph: Paul Natkin/Getty ImagesMuch later, for another publication, I attendeda human-fairy congressin rural Washington state. Both humans and fairies were welcome to attend but only humans could enroll in the courses on fairy gardening and fairy marriages. They were the residue of the hippies, I suppose. The final event was a big dance where the fairies joined them and parlayed a message from the spirit realm. A young man dressed in Tibetan shaman robes ran into the luscious meadow set between ponderosa pines shouting “I! Feel! Better!” He was a definitive American type – a seeker who just went with his seeking.In America, one bubble was as good as another: the next week, many of the human-fairy enthusiasts were headed to a cosmic Sasquatch festival.On the other side of the state, in the Olympia forest, I interviewed illegal lumber poachers who cut a cord of firewood a day from the dead trees on public lands for meth and food and gas money, a primitive existence not that far from stone age tribes or medieval peasants. As I approached their compound, a coagulation of wrecked cars and rotten RVs and driftwood lean-tos with hanging tarps, a turkey strutted out to defend their ad hoc architecture of detritus. They had a guard turkey. The guard turkey was the shine of their bubble, like something in a dream.The American dream. For technocrats, a dying breed in the US, the term was shorthand for each generation doing better than the one before, for generally upward social mobility. There was more to it than that. There was an idea, an assumption really, that if you had enough talent and worked hard and did the smart thing, with a little luck you could live life just as you wanted. The country’s founding promise, after all, is “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness”.That promise is why success in America does not lead to gratitude but to an intense sensation of loss. The elite take any deviation from their fantasy existence as a broken contract. They’ve been ripped off. That is a big feeling among the most successful people in America: the sense of being ripped off.As the authoritarian impulse strips America of any motivating ideals, the only -ism surviving is careerismThe country clubs are rife with men and women, in incredible luxury, complaining bitterly about the state of the country. The richest and most powerful, the Americans who have won, who have everything, are still not happy, and why? Their answer is that the American dream must be broken. There is no one who feels more betrayed by the American dream than the world’s richest man. Why else do you think he’s out there with a chainsaw?The American elites of the past 20 years have called their foremost principle freedom, but what they meant was impunity. That’s what the original slave masters built: a world where they could do whatever they wanted to whomever they wanted, without consequences. That’s what the techlords dream of today.The truly frictionless world they seek eludes them exactly because it is a dream, because it is unreal. The ultimate truth of bubbles is that they pop.Another bubble: when I was teaching Shakespeare in Harlem, at the City College ofNew York, I had a homeless student who slept in his car and never missed my seminar on revenge tragedy. You can only live that way if you live in a bubble buoyed by dreams.I, too, have floated in American bubbles. I have inhabited its intoxication. If it were not for America, I would be working part-time in a coffee shop.In the early 2010s, I was a writer stuck between Toronto and New York, and I had written my attempt at the great Canadian novel, about Alberta and Quebec and the unspoken fascination between them – between Montreal, with its wild heart, and the wild prairies filled with longing for a distant recognition. Nationalism was completely out of fashion then. No one in Canada would even look at the manuscript. My friends at small presses stopped accepting my invitations for drinks. You can be a loser and you can be a nag, but nobody wants both at the same time – even in Canada.View image in fullscreenPeople ride the subway in New York circa 1980.Photograph: Barbara Alper/Getty ImagesI had been sitting on the book for a year when David Granger, my editor at Esquire, invited me down to New York, rented out a room at a Midtown Manhattan restaurant, and threw a party for me, just to give a speech to the gathered editors of Hearst about what a great writer I was. I returned to Canada, asked myself what the hell was I thinking trying to tell the stories of people who didn’t care if their stories were told, rewrote the novel so it was set in New York, and sold it in a few weeks for six figures.People used to say, about New York: “If you can make it here you can make it anywhere.” Nothing could be further from the truth. The whole point of New York was that it was the city that wanted you to make it. David Granger blew a bubble around me, and the David Grangers on this planet are all American; that’s the fact of the matter.You work hard, you play hard. So many Americans will do whatever it takes to prevent their bubbles from bursting. The second Trump administration has clarified this national trait. As the authoritarian impulse strips America of any motivating ideals, the only -ism surviving is careerism.The past decade has demonstrated that there is nothing that will cause an American politician to resign. There is no line they won’t cross. To keep the bubble from popping, they will drink their own blood until there’s nothing left but a husk. There are currently people in America who are racist, not because they actually think other races are inferior, but because they think it will advance their careers, just as there were people pretending to be civil rights activists when they thought it looked good on a résumé.The definitive work of American art ... is the roadrunner cartoons. If Coyote keeps running, he can run over air. It is only when he looks down that he fallsAt the same time as there can be a terrible indifference to those outside the bubbles, there is no other group of people, in the world, happier to see others succeed than Americans. In Florida, there was a private poker room I used to go to, under a dog track in Sarasota, where you could meet the full spectrum of the Floridian population – grill-fronted southern bubbas, Jewish grandmothers, tweakers.They were just so much fun to sit playing cards with, discussing whether life had any purpose or discernible order. I remember, cancer had struck one of the dealers, who was in her mid-20s, and, to help with the medical bills, the house gave all the profits from a night over to her. It wasn’t just the rake, either. They held a silent auction, old customers forked over fistfuls of dollars straight up, and it was magnificent, a sheer festival of generosity.View image in fullscreenNew York in 1962.Photograph: David Attie/Getty ImagesBut my little Canadian heart reserved an obvious thought: “You don’t have to do all this.” You don’t have to live this way. No other industrialized country in the world has to throw parties to raise money for its sick people. They could not see their own strangeness. Their bubbles reflect themselves back to them as the world.But it was a hell of a fun night.Fun. America was fun.Other countries do pleasure or luxury or celebration. America did fun. The Beatles were fun because they played American music. McDonalds conquered the world because they put a fun-for-five-minutes piece of plastic in with the fries and called it the Happy Meal. “What’s great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest,” Andy Warhol once wrote. “A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking.”Everyone drinks the drink of bubbles, the fun drink.The bubbles by which they lived were the subject of their greatest works of art. In the great one-hit wonder paintings, likeChristina’s World by Andrew WyethorNighthawks by Edward Hopper, you can feel the souls pressed up against their bubbles or sinking back in them. This year is the 100th anniversary of The Great Gatsby, and obviously it is the great American novel, the novel of the careless people who smash up the world and retreat into their money and their supreme indifference, the novel of bubbles.But the definitive work of American art isn’t Gatsby; it’s the roadrunner cartoons. If Coyote keeps running, he can run over air. It is only when he looks down that he falls.In Judaism, it is forbidden to throw out sacred books. They keep the shreds of exhausted texts in a storage room called agenizah.View image in fullscreenA marching band plays during Mardi Gras in New Orleans circa 1970.Photograph: David Redfern/RedfernsThe American text is exhausted. I am going to keep my memories of America in agenizahin my mind, the ones I have written here but also: dawn over the Shenandoah seen from the flatbed of an F-150;Broadway Boogie Woogie by Piet Modrianin the MoMA; a New Orleans band that must have played When the Saints Go Marching In 10,000 times playing it as if it were the first time; the smell of tacos al pastor in a Tulsa parking lot; low-limit craps in Vegas; a western oriole strutting in pine needles; thestump of the “Tree of Hope” in Harlem; theSiesta Key Oyster Bar, where the walls were covered with Iraqi money stapled there by returning soldiers; the sausages at the Wrigley Field ballpark in Chicago; the New York hustler who went down the A train selling his romance novels out of a box; that wave at the border I may have half-imagined.Countries fall out of the free world. They fall back in, too. These memories are not yet dead. They are only closed.But for now, a great foam is lifting, drifting, blowing through unsettled air, and all I can hear, in the distance, is the sound of bubbles popping.View image in fullscreenThe Canada border in the 1980s.Stephen Marche lives in Toronto and is the author ofThe Next Civil WarandOn Writing and Failure"

Here’s what not to do to protect your investmentsRead moreInvestors are still unsure if some exemptions, such as those applied to smartphones, laptops and other electronic products from import tariffs on China,will prove short-lived, amplifying uncertainty.The volatility has convinced many investors to sell an assortment of US assets and direct their money to more stable markets elsewhere, in a strategy now known as the “sell America trade”.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterPeter Dragicevich, a Sydney-based currency strategist at Corpay, said investor confidence in the US has been shaken.“It’s not a complete loss of confidence, but it has been shaken by the chopping and changing in terms of US policy,” said Dragicevich.“There’s more economic risk in the US now and policy uncertainty from the Trump administration, so that’s going to dampen that demand for capital to find its way into the US markets.”Which assets are affected?There was an unusual moment at the height of trade tensions when US government bonds, traditionally seen as one of the world’s safest financial assets,were sold off.The US dollar, another safe haven, also lost value, as did American equities.This meant two safe-haven assets and one risk asset – shares – all fell at the same time, rather than moving in different directions as they typically do.The message was clear; investors were fleeing America.“This odd combination of market moves points to a widespread rejection of US assets,” says Ryan Swift, a US bond strategist at BCA Research.Swift says the trade war has damaged consumer and business confidence enough to “push the US economy into recession within the next few months”.Omkar Joshi, chief investment officer at Sydney-headquartered Opal Capital Management, says the US is “not a market that feels very stable”.“There’s a bit of a ‘sell America’ shift evolving,” Joshi says.Donald Trump’s tariffs are disrupting markets around the world – here’s why it could be hurting your superRead moreTrump’s subsequent backdown on many of the supersized tariffs offered some relief to markets, although enormous volatility remains.Against this backdrop, the Australian dollar has surged in recent days against a weak greenback, recovering all of its recent losses.Other currencies, such as the euro and the pound, have strongly outperformed the US dollar over the past month, in what could be interpreted as a vote of no confidence in the American economy.Such currency movements could persist should the “sell America trade” gain momentum.How will Australian markets respond?For all the worry, the US still entices plenty of investment, and calmer policy settings may eventually ease some of the anxiety.This would make the events of April a blip as opposed to a long-term shift in the way global investors direct their money.However, the huge shocks caused by the tariff policy may have already caused some industries to rethink their trading relationships with the US, creating a long-term drag on US wealth.Mathew Cherian, managing director at Melbourne-based health technology company MasterCare, says Australia should make its healthcare system less reliant on overseas products and technology in response to volatile trade relations.“The recent US tariffs highlight just how vulnerable our reliance on overseas imports has made us,” he says.Rather than rely on the US, entire sectors may decide to develop their own capabilities or find other nations to buy products from, both of which would make America less wealthy.There’s also been an early decoupling of the US and Australian markets, according to economists, as a result of Trump’s tariffs.While Wall Street would still set the tone for global share markets, including in Australia, they could end up with looser performance ties if the gap between the respective economies widens.The chief economist at AMP, Shane Oliver, says Australia may avoid a recession even if the US falls into one.“The US is most at risk because it has threatened virtually all of its trade whereas other countries are only seeing their trade with the US impacted,” Oliver says.Explore more on these topicsBusinessAustralian economyTrump tariffsDonald TrumpInternational tradeAustralian foreign policyexplainersShareReuse this content"

The beasts yawn imperiously in the sun, every twitch of their tails sparking an excited murmur.But when Aaron, Tyler and Cam Whitnall are spotted, the animals are instantly forgotten. The stars of children’sBBCprogramme One Zoo Three, are tenderly, but relentlessly, mobbed. “We got up at 5am to drive here,” explains one delighted, if bleary-eyed dad. “My daughter just loves you.”She is not the only one. The three brothers have become stars of children’s TV since the first series about their lives on their family zoo aired in 2000. But four decades after their grandparents bought “the worst zoo in the UK”, they have their sights on becoming a world-leading conservation organisation.“We want to be a beacon of hope here,” says Tyler, the middle brother, recovering from the adoration with a cup of tea in Zoo HQ. “One day we want to be known as the best zoo in the UK, up there with Chester, and a leader in terms of education, wildlife conservation, sustainability. We literally want to be at the top.”It’s a big ambition. Hertfordshire Zoo is small, even by UK standards, with about 1,000 animals across 16 acres – by comparison, Chester has at least 37,000 animals over its 128-acre site. But as the home of One Zoo Three, its footprint in the online world and children’s imaginations is outsized – and its presence on the global stage is growing.“We’ve got our fingers in every pie,” says Cameron, the youngest of the brothers, who admits to finding it a “bit awkward” when mums approach him about the show in the pub.Birth of endangered red panda cub at UK zoo a ‘symbol of hope’Read moreThe trio rolled out their fifth season of One Zoo Three last year, and the corporationadded the show to BBC Bitesize, its educational offering for schools. On the conservation front, the zoo has recentlyprotected penguins in South Africa, releasedrehabilitated lions back into the wildin Uganda and broughtfive traumatised lions from the war zone in Ukraineto their sister site theBig Cat Sanctuaryin Kent. It is also moving into research and preservation, recently signing a deal withNature’s Safe, a wildlife biobank to cryopreserve skin and semen samples.In the Easter holidays the busy zoo – with its colourful information boards, rammed play parks and regular talks – is a far cry from the bleak site that Peter and Grace Sampson, the brothers’ grandparents, bought in 1984 to build a depot for their successful coach company.It looked “as if a hurricane had gone through it” says the boys’ mother and zoo chief executive Lynn Whitnall. Animals were living in inhumane conditions. Footage from the old zoo shows a chimp dressed in human clothes, with a chain around its neck, smoking a cigarette. Its main attraction, alion called Bobby, was kept in a small enclosure with a corrugated iron roof and had never felt grass under his feet.Plans for the depot went out of the window. “The love of the animals took over,” says Lynn. After closing for 18 months and pulling in favours from coach drivers and mechanics to build new enclosures, the zoo was given a licence and opened as Paradise Park and Woodland Zoo in Easter 1986.“People weren’t really all that supportive, especially within the zoo profession,” says Aaron. “They kind of saw the family as outsiders.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

After decades of investment and supporting conservation projects, the zoo’s reputation has “come a full 180”, he says. “Since Covid, we’ve had more zoo directors and important people from within the world of conservation visit us than we did in the 20 years before.”By any reckoning, growing up on site at the zoo gave the brothers an extraordinary childhood. When Cam, the youngest, got in a grump he would go and sit with the monkeys. Aaron slept with a rescued lioness cub who had been rejected by her family for several months. “We wouldn’t do it now, but after hours we would just go and sit in with the meerkats or the porcupines or the tapirs in the evenings,” says Cam.Those moments fired their passion to share a love of wildlife – either through experiences in the zoo, through the show or in their hyperactive social media output, says Tyler.At a moment when vast swathes of natural habitats are beingdestroyed by human development and the climate crisis– according to the most recent figures,wildlife populations have plungedby an average of 69% between 1970 and 2018. The brothers admit to a heavy feeling of responsibility, but argue that showing what good zoos can do – and making kids laugh, care and have hope – is critical to the conservation fight.“The way we’ve grown up is getting close to animals, that’s how we’ve fallen in love with them,” he says. “Sharing the wonder of wildlife is our slogan for a reason.”Explore more on these topicsZoosHertfordshireBBCCBBCConservationAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For challenging Nicolás Maduro’s government, the siblings were threatened by armed pro-regime gangs calledcolectivos.View image in fullscreenSoldiers stand guard outside the Cecot prison in Tecoluca, El Salvador, on 4 April.Photograph: José Cabezas/Reuters“It was a really difficult time,” recalled Nelson Suárez, 35, whose brother relocated to Cartagena and Bogotá, in Colombia, before moving to Chile, where hundreds of thousands of uprooted Venezuelans have migrated over the past decade. Nelson Suárez headed north to the US.In Santiago, Arturo Suárez built a new life, fixing fridges as he chased his dream of becoming a famous singer-songwriter, under the stage name isSuarezVzla. He became a relentless promoter of Venezuelan music, founding an event called Urban Fresh to showcase budding reggaeton and trap stars. “Arturo’s my mentor,” said Mariangelica Camacho, 20, a dancer and singer who fled Venezuela with her parents at age 14 and whose career he helped launch.At one gig he met his future wife.But making ends meet was a struggle, particularly after the Covid pandemichammered Chile’s economy. Last May, Suárez decided to join his brother in North Carolina and embarked on a five-month odyssey to the US that involved crossing the treacherous jungles of the Darién Gap between Colombia and Panama.Sánchez, who was pregnant, decided not to risk the journey having suffered a miscarriage the previous year, and remained in Santiago. Before setting off from their shoebox apartment looking out across the Andes, Suárez wrote a message to his “lioness” and his unborn child on a whiteboard hanging over her cot. “Soon we’ll be together again,” it says. “I love you both with all my life.”By September, after two months toiling in a Mexico City tortilla shop, Suárez reached the southern border, crossing into San Diego after making an immigration appointment on the Biden-era smartphone app called CBP One. From there he made a beeline for New Bern, North Carolina, where he found work as a handyman, mowing lawns and cleaning pools to support baby Nahiara, who was born in early December.But Suárez’s American dream quickly crumbled. In February, three weeks after Trump’s inauguration, he was detained by immigration officials while making a music video in Raleigh. After a stint in an Atlanta detention centre, he was moved to Texas and then – to his family’s horror – sent toEl Salvadorafter being told he was being deported to Venezuela.View image in fullscreenNathali Sanchez, the wife of Arturo Suárez, on 16 April.Photograph: Cristóbal Olivares/The GuardianOn 16 March, 24 hours after Suárez was incarcerated in Bukele’s terrorism confinement centre (Cecot), Sánchez spotted her shaven-headed husband in a propaganda photo released by the Central American country’s government. She recognized him because of tattoos on his neck and thigh and a childhood scar on his scalp. “I felt like the world had collapsed on top of me,” Sánchez said. Since then she has heard nothing and, in her darkest moments, fears he may not even still be alive.“We’ve lost all communication,” said Krubick Izarra, 26, a music producer who is godmother to the couple’s child.Trump’s El Salvador deportations – which activists callenforced disappearances– have grim echoes in Latin America, where such tactics were common during the US-backed dictatorships of the 1970s and 80s.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At least 368 of them have died as a result of torture, according to the Cristosal’s count.View image in fullscreenFriends of Arturo Suárez rehearse a music event that Suárez was planning remotely from the US before he was sent to El Salvador by the Trump administration.Photograph: Cristóbal Olivares/The GuardianBullock believed the fate of prisoners such as Suárez hinged on whether it was “politically viable” for Trump and Bukele to keep them behind bars, despite mounting evidence of their innocence. “The only option for them, I think, is public advocacy and building sufficient political pressure for their freedom,” he said.Making noise is something Suárez’s musician friends in Santiago are good at.One evening last week, they gathered in a rehearsal room to practise for their latest concert and defend a man they called a cheery, kindhearted, teetotal dreamer whose only crime was seeking a better life.‘Deported because of his tattoos’: has the US targeted Venezuelans for their body art?Read more“Arturo has never harmed anyone – and he certainly isn’t a terrorist,” said Heberth Veliz, a 29-year-old musician who suspected his friend had been targeted because of his numerous tattoos, which include a tribute to his late mother, a map of Venezuela, a palm tree, some musical notes and the phrase “The future will be brilliant.”Veliz, whose body is also covered in tattoos, said he struggled to contain his anger when he saw the US president on television smearing Suárez as “the worst of the worst”. “I feel like jumping into the screen and slapping him so he stops talking nonsense. ‘Shut up, Trump! You don’t know what you’re talking about!’” he fumed, although he admitted he was not surprised by his friend’s treatment. “Everyone knows that the most ruthless people wear suits and ties,” he said.Cradling baby Nahiara in a pink shawl, Sánchez said she was determined to stay strong for the sake of her daughter and her absent husband. “It’s up to me to be the pillar of the family now,” she declared, vowing to continue denouncing her husband’s capture. “When he gets out, I want him to see that I didn’t give up – and I want him to feel proud.”View image in fullscreenNathali Sanchez at her home with her four-month-old daughter, Nahiara, in Santiago, Chile, on 16 April.Photograph: Cristóbal Olivares/The GuardianSpeaking from the US, Nelson Suárez said he believed Trump was using innocent Venezuelans such as his sibling as “guinea pigs” to show off to his base.

Does it remind you of anything?”O’Shaughnessy, an illustrator and senior lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University, first began using smells with art students, asking them “to develop projects and concepts” based on scents “because it’s a leveller”.“You’ve got kids who are bright and they can run with design, illustration projects,” he added. “But this project in particular, I noticed that the clever kids didn’t always respond more effectively than the kids who may be mixed ability.”He was running a similar workshop for the public at Tate Liverpool when he was approached by a prison education provider, who asked if he would fancy trying to run one in jail. “I was fascinated,” he said. “I really wanted to do it.”Now, his prison workshops, named Perfume Stories, have been so successful that he has trained in-house staff to deliver the workshops. O’Shaughnessy sources the scents himself and volunteers his time to teach.View image in fullscreenParticipants in the workshops write down their memories after smelling certain scents.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianParticipants are given small white cards, which have been doused in perfume. They are asked to smell them and use that scent as a springboard to create prose, a poem or – if they are less comfortable with writing – a drawing.“The thing about smell is that you don’t have to be clever to have that memory; that’s your memory,” O’Shaughnessy said – those who may not have excelled in school may have a more developed sense of smell than others who did.O’Shaughnessy chooses the fragrances he works with carefully; he wants to invoke positive memories, and take prisoners back to happier times. “I avoid certain very heavily masculine smells, in case any of them have had bad male experiences,” he said.At the end of the session, he asks the students to write a single observation on a sticky note. “Opening brand new toy soldiers on Christmas Day. Good times as a kid. 53 years ago,” one inmate wrote.Others recalled holidays, smelling the roses on walks in the park with a dog or spending their pocket money on trips to the sweet shop. Some say the workshop brought back memories of parents, children or former partners.“This smell reminded me of being at my nan’s as a young kid, messing around with all the creams, perfumes and hair oil on her chest of drawers,” another wrote. “This memory takes me back to the ages of seven, eight, nine, and 10, and is a memory I’ve never actually thought of before.”Perfume Stories is mainly used in English lessons, but at HMP Holme House in Stockton-On-Tees, O’Shaughnessy’s project has been used across the curriculum, in hospitality, business studies and barbering.In hospitality, food scents were used to help learners to recall specific dishes from their childhoods, with them then drawing up a bistro menu inspired by their memories. These included dishes named after their inspiration, such as “Nana Betty’s hotpot”.View image in fullscreenMichael O’Shaughnessy was approached by a prison education provider after running scent workshops in art galleries.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianIn business studies, learners considered how scents can be used in marketing, and to drive purchasing.“Learners gain a great deal of skills from it, from debating skills, to writing skills, to analysis skills,” an education manager at the prison said. “It has been a great project used at Holme House, and the learners always engage well in it.”As he sought to expand his work, O’Shaughnessy approached some of the biggest fragrance houses across the globe, hoping to find collaborators for his project. While initially he had little success, he found help closer to home, from Carvansons, a bespoke perfume creator in Haslingden, Lancashire.“Basically we were the only ones that responded,” said Vicki Last, the company’s marketing manager. “He sent out his advertising portfolio and some of the work he’d been working on, and said: would you be interested in just even talking about it?”Carvansons has produced several bespoke fragrances for O’Shaughnessy, which he has used in his workshops. One of the many smells in his silver chest, requested by a member of staff at a prison in the north-east, was “tomatoes ripening in a greenhouse”. Another scent, that he bought from a company in Los Angeles, was “box-fresh trainers”.When asked what prison smells like, O’Shaughnessy responded enthusiastically: “I’ve got the smell of prison!”He added: “I think it’s like a room which has had no air, and it’s had roast beef made in it, left for weeks, and it’s got that musty old food smell, no air smell.“It’s got like an animalistic thing at the heart. “It’s a combination of old sweat, beef, and it’s very distinctive, but it’s not nice.”Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationMemorynewsShareReuse this content"

The venue is filling up with an assorted crowd of predominantly punky and boyish-looking people of all genders. There’s no shortage of fauxhawks, baseball caps and mullets in the room.Holi Dae Knight, introducing the drag king show tonight called SlayBoy, has just taken to the stage in a green sequined dress, hot pink hair and a full moustache and bushy beard performing Cher’s Believe. It’s the last night of a three week season of SlayBoy and the crowd is here to see drag kings.

And for some reason I enjoyed it a lot too – which I later realised was perhaps an early sign that I was transgender.”Roy says the current wave of drag kings shows are mostly produced and hosted in a DIY fashion by the performers themselves.The inspirational rise of drag kings: ‘We are smashing down doors left, right and centre!’Read more“Are there more shows being produced and hosted by drag kings at the moment? Absolutely,” he says.“But on the flip side, there’s less of a king presence integrated into the rest of the community, more of a divide when we used to have drag kings appear more often on lineups alongside queens.”The term “drag king” was first cited in print in 1972 in the bookThe Queens’ Vernacular – a Gay Lexiconby Bruce Rodgers but early records of women dressing as men for performative purposes go back as far as the 7th century Tang dynasty in China, where the practice of female-men characters (orkunsheng) was common for stage performances.In the west there are many notable performers such as British singer Vesta Tilley who performed between 1869 and 1920 as a male impersonator and the notable Stormé DeLarverie who performed in male drag throughout the 1950s and 60s and was credited as the original spark that ignited the stonewall riots in New York in June 1969.View image in fullscreenRandy Roy eyes the crowd. Roy says it is up to the wider queer community to make more space for drag kings in their venue programming.Photograph: Penny Stephens/The GuardianAccording to Australian drag king pioneer Sexy Galexy, the local drag king scene took off in the 1990s with Sydney pioneers like Divinyl, who created DKSY (Drag King Sydney at Arq nightclub) before establishing Kingki Kingdom and Moist in the early 2000s, after she had performed for many years in Perth throughout the 1990s.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning“Back when I started out, there was no social media or mobile phones, we connected by going out and being part of our community,” Sexy Galexy says.“The clubs, bars, and streets were alive with underground drag and creative energy, with plenty of venues to perform at. Drag kings were rare, especially ones doing glam drag like I was as far as I knew, I was the first. Women would dress up too, slipping on moustaches, becoming suave, sexy kings for the night, and with no cameras around, the scene felt private, raw, and wildly experimental.”View image in fullscreenThe Sircuit crowd cheers on a performer.Photograph: Penny Stephens/The GuardianBut it was in Melbourne that the strongest drag king scene emerged – with KingVictoria, Melbourne’s popular drag king club that ran for 11 years between 2000 and 2011, claiming to be the longest-running weekly drag king club in the world. The club hosted more than 500 distinct cabaret events, featuring thousands of lesbian, trans, non-binary and queer artists, with both local and international performers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It had a 150 venue capacity and over 500 people lining up outside the door.”View image in fullscreenBelial B’Zarr and Justin Sider run through their routine before the show.Photograph: Penny Stephens/The GuardianAfter the success of these competitions, Favell established the weekly King Victoria nights at the Star Hotel in Collingwood. “Anyone who wanted to be a drag king could have at least one go. People would come to the technical run through looking shy and drab and as soon as they got their moustache on they were strutting – defiant, proud, funny and sexy.”Although encouraged to see the more underground, DIY resurgence of drag kings today, Favell has also noticed some differences in the way drag kings present themselves now.“The main thing I’ve noticed is many drag kings now do a lot heavier drag queen style makeup. They don’t necessarily pack or bind like we religiously did. I think around 2000 when we started, lesbians and queer/trans people felt very separate from the dominant world, and we used to make fun of everything, create ridiculous stories about male tropes and heroes.”How I fell in love with performing as a drag king | Dani WeberRead moreView image in fullscreenBelial B’Zarr brings some sparkle to the stage during SlayBoy.Photograph: Penny Stephens/The GuardianRoy says it is up to the wider queer community to make more space for drag kings in their venue programming.“Queer venues and events often make statements about community and diversity, but at the end of the day the performers being spotlighted are what speaks the loudest.”Author and historian Art Simone, who has recently published the bookDrag Queens Down Under, says that despite the ongoing presence of drag kings on the fringes of queer culture, they remain relatively marginalised.“With mainstream shows such as Drag Race still refusing to spotlight kings, they are forced to remain in the shadows of their big-wigged counterparts and keep knocking down the doors of opportunity.”Explore more on these topicsVictoriaDragLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Authentic-looking exotic flowers lined the floor, tree trunks soared up to an artificial canopy and reeds hung from their branches. Peering between them was Hollywood A-lister Scarlett Johansson.The extravagant construction was a set in Sky Studios Elstree where the movieJurassic World: Rebirthwas being made. Filming there, instead of in an actual jungle, enabledUniversal Picturesto pocket millions of pounds of UK taxpayers’ money to partially cover its blockbuster costs.Jurassic World: Rebirth, which is released in cinemas in July, is thethird movie about dinosaursthat Universal has made in the UK. Recently filed documents reveal that HMRC gave its predecessor, 2022’sJurassic World: Dominion, £89.1m – believed to be the largest payment for a film since the UK government incentive scheme began in 2007. The scheme, designed todrive investment in the UK’s film industry, gives studios a reimbursement of up to 25.5% of the sum they spend on making a movie in the UK, provided that at least 10% of its total cost is incurred there.Analysis of more than 400 sets of filings also shows thatDominionwas one of the most expensive movies of all time, with total costs of £453.6m, just overtaking the £452m spent onStar Wars: The Force Awakensin 2015.The £89.1m from the incentive scheme, along with £2.8m from the coronavirus job retention scheme, brought the net cost of makingDominiondown to £361.7m. Its 2018 prequel,Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, banked a further £70.7m from the scheme, bringing the total to £159.8m for the two. Universal’s movie division made combined profits of £3.9bn ($5.2bn) during the time thatDominionwas made.View image in fullscreenOn the set of dinosaur blockbuster Jurassic World: Dominion.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyThe latest data from HMRC shows that, in 2023, it handed a total of £553m to movie studios, bringing the total paid since 2007 to £5.9bn. When it increased the level of tax relief for the film industry about a decade ago, the government noted that “this measure is expected to have a positive impact on the film industry, but is not expected to have significant wider macroeconomic impacts”.The latest data from the British Film Institute (BFI) shows that, in 2019, every £1 of reimbursement handed to studios generated £8.30 of additional Gross Value Added (GVA) benefit for Britain’s economy. It led to a total of £7.7bn in GVA being generated by the film incentives in 2019.View image in fullscreenLaura Dern in a scene from the £453m movie Jurassic World: Dominion.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyReleased in December 2021, the BFI’s Screen Business report shows that, between 2017 and 2019, the incentives to studios yielded a record £13.5bn of return on investment to Britain’s economy and created more jobs than ever before. Filming drives spending on services such as security, equipment hire, transport and catering. In 2019, this spending created 49,845 jobs in London and 19,085 throughout the rest of Britain. Universal alone spent £37.5m on the staff behindDominionandFallen Kingdom.Critics, however, have queried the effectiveness of the scheme. Some argue that Britain’s filming facilities, talent and landscape are strong enough to attract studios without incentives, so the UK could reap the benefits without the government needing to spend any money.John O’Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, which campaigns for reform of UK taxation , said: “It’s little wonder that the majority of taxpayers feel hard done by when they see the eye-popping sums saved by larger companies. Inward investment is a major boon for the UK but the right balance must be struck.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The cost of movies made in the US is usually a closely guarded secret as studios tend to absorb the cost of individual films in their overall expenses and don’t itemise how much was spent on each one.In contrast, studios set up separate companies for movies made in the UK to show more than 10% of the total cost was spent here, in order to qualify for the scheme. The companies have to file annual accounts, which lifts the curtain on everything from staff numbers and salaries to total costs.Dominionstarred Chris Pratt, along with Laura Dern, Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum – the original cast of the 1993 Oscar-winnerJurassic Park. It was made at the height of the pandemic in 2020, causing the cast to quarantine for five months at the opulent Langley hotel, a former manor home of the third Duke of Marlborough where rooms cost more than £400 a night.William Sargent, chair of London-based visual effects firm Framestore, said: “The spend happens and taxes are paid a year at least before the government writes a cheque in return.” He added that film industry workers then spend the money they have been paid which, in turn, generates more tax receipts for the government: “If you follow the actual tax collection against the impact of this onward money, it vastly exceeds the payout.”Universal Pictures was contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsFilmThe ObserverUniversal PicturesJurassic WorldTaxnewsShareReuse this content"

Voters want more than just Labour and ToriesRobert FordBadenoch is braced for heavy losses in the local elections on 1 May, but as Labour stumbles and Greens and Lib Dems surge, the contest is wide openSun 20 Apr 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Apr 2025 08.31 EDTShareA byelection in a normally safe Labour seat was Keir Starmer’s first big electoral test as Labour leader. A similar scenario now provides his first test as prime minister. Theloss of Hartlepool to Boris Johnson’s Conservatives in 2021provoked the biggest crisis of Starmer’s time as opposition leader, forcing sweeping changes in personnel and approach. The loss ofRuncorn and Helsbyto Nigel Farage’s Reform UK could be similarly bruising. Labour ought to start as favourites, having won this socially mixed marginal corner of Cheshire by a massive margin less than a year ago. But with polls showing a Labour slump, a Reform surge and a restive, dissatisfied public, all bets are off.The Runcorn result will set the tone for this year’s round of local and mayoral elections. A Labour hold will take the pressure off a harried government; a Reform breakthrough will stoke the heat up further, boostingFarage’s claim to be parking his tanks on Labour’s lawn, and jangling the nerves of anxious Labour MPs in the restored “red wall”. While Farage may hurt Labour in Runcorn, it is the Conservatives who face the most pain in this year’s English local elections. Most are in blue-leaning parts of the Midlands and south, and the Tories swept the board when they were last contested in 2021, with Farage off the scene and the government riding a “vaccine bounce” in the polls. Nearly 1,000 Conservative councillors are up for re-election in May, and withKemi Badenoch’s party polling below its disastrous showing last July, hundreds look set to lose their jobs. Nearly a year on from their worst ever general election result, the Conservatives still have further to fall.The big story of these contests will be the search for something new. Reform’s rise has taken the headlines, and with Farage’s party on the ballot in nearly every local contest, it looks set to surpass its predecessor Ukip’s best performances. Many seats are available in heavily leave-voting areas such as Derbyshire, Lincolnshire and Kent, all areas where Reform candidates did well last July. Reform may also capture bigger prizes. The party has fielded a defecting Tory MP in Lincolnshire and an Olympic gold medallist in Hull and East Yorkshire, and a fragmented field could deliver either mayoralty to the insurgents.Reform, though, is not the only game in town for voters unhappy with traditional politics. Both the Liberal Democrats and the Greens have been surging in recent local elections, and both look set to make further gains. Hundreds of seat gains since 2022 have restored the Lib Dems’ fortunes in local government after the harrowing experience of coalition, and formed a springboard to last July’sbest-in-a-century result. Ed Davey will hope to cement his party’s status as the dominant force in the home counties with another strong showing in once true-blue shires such as Oxfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Gloucestershire, and perhaps come through the middle in one of the fragmented mayoral contests.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage’s Reform UK is looking to take seats from Kemi Badenoch’s moribund Conservative party.Composite: PAThe Greens have also been on the rise, fielding ever more candidates and making hundreds of gains in recent years. Like the Lib Dems before them, the Greens hope that a growing presence in town halls can provide the crucial credibility needed to turn polling advances into Westminster seats. All three Green gains in the general election came in areas where the party had built a strong council presence. An even bigger prize may also be in reach in the west of England mayoralty, wherescandal has tainted the outgoing Labour incumbentand given the Greens an opening in a combined authority taking in their stronghold of Bristol.With Labour sliding, the Conservatives moribund, theLiberal Democratsrestored to health, and Reform and Green challengers springing up almost everywhere, this will be the first true five-party local election contest. This unprecedented fragmentation puts the electorate on a collision course with the electoral system. First past the post is an amplifier: the winner takes all, everyone else gets nothing. But when voters divide evenly between multiple choices, this is a recipe for chaos.Hundreds of councillors and mayors are likely to be returned next month despite large majorities voting for someone else. With votes splitting three or four ways, divided opposition will become as important as local support. Subtle variations in geography and popularity, like the proverbial flap of the butterfly’s wings, will often be the difference between triumph and disaster.Such instability and inconsistency will make next month’s contests harder to understand and their outcomes harder to justify. Fragmented fights with messy outcomes will also underline something deeper: two-party politics is dying in Britain. Voters no longer want to be forced to choose betweenLabourand Tory, and ignore the institutional constraints supposed to channel them into this choice. Support for the establishment parties hit an all-time low last July and has kept falling in polling since. The electoral system held back this tide, much to Labour’s benefit, but no flood wall is impregnable. Next month we may see what happens when the dam breaks.Robert Ford is professor of political science at Manchester University and co-author of The British General Election of 2019Explore more on these topicsLocal electionsThe ObserverKemi BadenochNigel FarageReform UKConservativesLabourKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

Rights groups say he has had full control over the judiciary since he dissolved parliament in 2021 and began ruling by decree. He dissolved the independent supreme judicial council and sacked dozens of judges in 2022.“We are not surprised by these unjust and vengeful verdicts that seek to silence the voices of these opposition figures,” Chaouachi’s son Youssef said“I have never witnessed a trial like this. It’s a farce, the rulings are ready, and what is happening is scandalous and shameful,” said defence lawyer Ahmed Souab on Friday before the ruling was handed down.Authorities say the defendants, who also include former officials and the former head of intelligence Kamel Guizani, tried to destabilise the country and overthrow Saied.“The authorities want to criminalise the opposition,” said the leader of the main National Salvation Front opposition coalition, Nejib Chebbi, on Friday. Chebbi was also among the defendants.Saied said in 2023 the politicians were “traitors and terrorists” and that judges who would acquit them were their accomplices.The opposition leaders involved in the case accuse Saied of staging a coup in 2021 and say the case is fabricated to stifle the opposition and establish a one-man, repressive rule.They say they were preparing an initiative aimed at uniting the fragmented opposition to face the democratic setback inthe cradle of the Arab spring uprisings.Most of the leaders of political parties inTunisiaare in prison, including Abir Moussi, the leader of the Free Constitutional party, and Rached Ghannouchi, the head of Ennahda – two of Saied’s most prominent opponents.Explore more on these topicsTunisiaMiddle East and north AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Two days later, the federal court document notes that Hermosillo continued to claim he was a US citizen. On 17 April, a federal judgedismissedhis case.Hermosillo’s wrongful arrest and prolonged detention comes amid escalating attacks by the Trump administration on immigrants in the US. SinceDonald Trumptook office, theadministrationhas emboldened immigration officers to arrest and deport undocumented people, including foreign students whose visas have been revoked, leading to a series of errors.US supreme court orders temporary halt to deportations of Venezuelan menRead more“Under the Trump administration’s theory of the law, the government could have banished this U.S. citizen to a Salvadoran prison then refused to do anything to bring him back,” Mark Joseph Stern, a legal analyst for Slate,wroteon Bluesky. “This is why the Constitution guarantees due process to all. Could it be more obvious?”During his campaign for the presidency, the US president promised to carry out “mass deportations”. In the three months since he took office, several foreign tourists have been wrongfully detained, federal agents from other agencies have been deputized to engage in immigration enforcement and Trump has invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, declaring that Venezuelan gang members are a leading foreign invasion of the United States to give himself the power to expel immigrants to a notorious Salvadorian prison.According to AZPM’s report, Hermosillo was visiting the Tucson area from Albuquerque, got lost without identification and was arrested by border patrol officials near its headquarters in Nogales. Hermosillo’s girlfriend’s family made numerous calls looking for him before they discovered he was being held atthe Florence Correctional Center, a privately run Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility. After his arrest, the court docket shows, he was temporarily detained in the custody of the US marshals.After the family tracked him done, they provided officials with his birth certificate and social security card.“He did say he was a US citizen, but they didn’t believe him,” Hermosillo’s girlfriend’s aunt told AZPM. “I think they would have kept him. I think they would have, if they would have not got that information yesterday in the court, and gave that to Ice and the border patrol. He probably would have been deported already toMexico.”Ice, Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Homeland Security and Hermosillo’s attorney did not respond to requests for comment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But immigration officials’ detention of citizens is not new, and it has taken place across presidential administrations. In 2021, the Government Accountability Officefoundthat from 2015 through 2020, Ice arrested 674 US citizens and deported 70 of them. And from 2007 through 2015, 818 US citizens were held in immigration detention,according to a 2016 analysisfrom NPR.In recent months, the Trump administration has revoked the visas of hundreds of foreign students, many for taking part in Gaza solidarity protests the administration call antisemitic .

That’s a very dangerous view. If we deny the constitutional rights of this one man, it threatens the constitutional rights of everyone in America.”Van Hollen, who returned to the US on Friday after meeting with Ábrego García, has accused administration officials of lying about Ábrego García’s case in attempt to distract from questions about whether his rights were violated when he was deported toEl Salvadorlast month.“I’m for whatever gives him his due process rights,” Van Hollen told the outlet. “An immigration judge in 2019 said he should not be deported to El Salvador because that would put his life at risk from gang members like MS-13.“TheTrump administrationdid not appeal that immigration judge’s order to keep him in the United States. He is here legally now, has a work permit, is a sheet metal worker, has a family, and three kids,” he said.“I am fine with whatever result happens as long as he is given his due process rights under the constitution,” Van Hollen added. The administration has said Ábrego García’s deportation was an “administrative error” and the supreme court has ordered that the government “facilitate” his return, setting up a contentious debate of what that means in practical terms.As Van Hollen made the rounds of political shows on Sunday, he expanded on the theme of a constitutional crisis. On NBC’s Meet the Presshe was askedif the US was in constitutional crisis with the Trump administration.“Oh, yes, we are. They are very much flouting the courts as we speak. As the courts have said, facilitating his return means something more than doing nothing, and they are doing nothing. Yes, they’re absolutely in violation of the court’s orders as we speak,” he said.“My whole point here is that if you deprive one man of his constitutional rights, you threaten the constitutional rights of everybody,”Van Hollen saidlater to Fox News Sunday host, Shannon Bream. “I would hope that all of us would understand that principle – you’re a lawyer. I’m not vouching for the individual, I’m vouching for his rights.”On ABC’s This Week, Van Hollen was asked if he had walked into a trap when García was brought to his hotel for an hour-long meeting and the pair were pictured with margaritas. The senator said the drinks were placed there by agovernment official for the photos, and not touched, and added that the trip wasn’t a trap because his purpose had been to meet with García so he could “tell his wife and family he was okay”.“That was my goal. And I achieved that goal,” he said.But he added that “the Salvadorian authorities tried to deceive people. They tried to make it look like he was in paradise. They actually wanted to have the meeting by the hotel pool originally.”The senator also accused Tom Homan, Trump’s “border czar”, of “lying through his teeth” about Ábrego García, andstrongly rejectedcomments by Gavin Newsom, the California governor seen as a potential candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028, who said that it was politically dangerous for Democrats to defend the wrongly deported man.“I think what Americans are tired of, is people who want to put their finger to the wind to see what’s going on,” the senator said. “I would say that anyone that’s not prepared to defend the constitutional rights of one man, when they threaten the constitutional rights of all, doesn’t deserve to lead.”After the meeting, President Nayib Bukele post the image on X, writing that García “miraculously risen from the ‘death camps’ & ‘torture’, now sipping margaritas with Senator Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador!”Van Hollen said the venue for the meeting and the subsequent picture “just goes to show the lengths that Bukele and Trump will go to try to deceive people about what this case is all about”.On Friday, the White House mocked Van Hollen byannotating a headline abouthis Thursday meeting with García. “Fixed it for you, New York Times,” the White HouseX accountshared. “Oh, and by the way, Chris Van Hollen – he’s NOT coming back.”The annotated headline changes “Senator Meets With Wrongly DeportedMarylandMan in El Salvador” included crossing out “Wrongly” in red ink and replacing the words “Maryland Man” with “MS-13 Illegal Alien”. They also added “Who’s Never Coming Back.”US supreme court orders temporary halt to deportations of Venezuelan menRead moreBut Ábrego García’s deportation was also facing opposition from Republicans. On Sunday, Louisiana senator John Kennedywas askedon Meet The Press if Ábrego García should be returned to the US.Kennedy said that Van Hollen’s trip to El Salvador and calls for Ábrego García to be returned to the US were “utterly and gloriously wrong” and said that “most of this gauzy rhetoric is just rage bait. Unless you’re next level obtuse, you know that Mr García is never coming back to the United States, ever.”But Kennedy conceded that Ábrego García’s deportation “was a screw up”, adding that “the administration won’t admit it, but this was a screw up. Mr Garcia was not supposed to be sent to El Salvador. He was sent to El Salvador.” But he said Democrats’ response was typical.“The Democrats say, ‘Look, you know, we told you, Trump is a threat to democracy’. This is going to happen every other Thursday afternoon. I don’t see any pattern here. I mean, you know, some day pigs may fly, but I doubt it,”” he added.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationEl SalvadorAmericasUS politicsDonald TrumpMarylandnewsShareReuse this content"

I can assure you there is no one on our side waving a white flag,” the shadow housing minister, Michael Sukkar, told ABC’s Insiders on Sunday.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterParty strategists maintain that while the Coalition vote has “softened” in recent weeks, their internal numbers are not as dire as those in the public domain. The opposition is still confident of gaining several Melbourne seats, including Chisholm, Aston and McEwen.But a strong showing in Victoria won’t be enough to put Dutton within striking distance of even minority government unless he makes inroads elsewhere – particularly New South Wales and Western Australia.The latestGuardian Essential pollfound 47% of voters were either undecided or could still be turned, making the final 12 days of campaigning absolutely critical for the two leaders.2.The big scareAccusations of so-called “scare campaigns” are part and parcel of elections – and 2025 has been no different.Labor has for weeks claimed the Coalition would need to gut Medicare – or other essential services – to fund its “$600bn nuclear reactors”. These accusations have been levelled despite the opposition matching Labor’s major health commitments, including $8.5bn to boost bulk-billing rates.Labor’s attacks have continued unabated, escalating to the point of claims online thatDutton would cut funding to Medicareurgent clinics, “forcing them to close”.US’s retreat on foreign aid and climate is reshaping world order, Anthony Albanese saysRead moreFor the record, the Coalition iscommitted to all existing clinicsand has promised to open several others if elected. However, it has stopped short of supporting Labor’s pre-election pledge to open 50 new centres, labelling it as pork-barrelling.The employment minister, Murray Watt, refused to back down when challenged on Sunday on the “lie” Labor was pushing.“How else can he pay for his $600bn in nuclear reactors?” Watt told Sky News.The shadow transport minister, Bridget McKenzie, said the Coalition’s full list of proposed clinic sites would be released by 3 May. But she made a clear promise on Sunday that no clinics were slated for closure under a Dutton government.That assurance is unlikely to stop Labor’s campaign.3.DefenceThe opposition is expected to use the run-up to Anzac Day on Friday to unveil its defence policy, which will probably be its final major announcement ahead of polling day.Labor has committed to increase the military budget to beyond 2.3% of GDP by 2033-34.Dutton last week told the Australian newspaper that target was“totally inadequate”, all but confirming the Coalition would seek to outgun Labor on defence spending.4.What’s the cost?Labor and the Coalition have so far made multibillion-dollar promises in health, housing and income tax, among other areas, with scarce detail on exactly what – if anything – would be cut to fund the spending.Some of those details will be revealed when the major parties release their full election costings ahead of 3 May. The highly anticipated documents will finally put a price tag on several Coalition policies, including itspromised tax-deductible lunches.4:48The housing crisis isn't sparing Peter Dutton's son, and Albanese won't spare a hug – videoThe opposition has previously promised a $7bn annual savings from downsizing the federal public service by 41,000 employees through a combination of a hiring freeze, natural attritionand voluntary redundancies.Dutton hinted at least week’s leaders’ debate that its savings would not be limited to the public service.The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, has confirmed a re-elected Albanese government would continue toreduce the commonwealth’s use of consultantsafter saving almost $5bn on outsourced work in the last term.5.The final debatesAlbanese and Dutton havefaced-off twicein the campaign so far: first at a News Corp-hosted people’s forum and then inside the ABC’s Parramatta studios.Channel 9 will host the third debate on Tuesday night, just hours after early voting begins.And 7News will host the fourth and final debate on 27 April, giving the leaders one last chance to impress a prime-time audience before polling day.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Australian politicsLabor partyCoalitionAnthony AlbanesePeter DuttonLiberal partynewsShareReuse this content"

The Greens will introduce a bill to clean up these industries and bring transparency, so this never happens again.”The agriculture department has rejected suggestions that its oversight of export abattoirs is compromised or that it suffers a conflict of interest in its dual roles of promoting the industry and monitoring animal welfare.It denied it suffers an understaffing crisis and says it has enough staff to oversee all export abattoirs that require a veterinarian presence. It also rejected allegations that vets had been banned from entering pens to conduct up-close ante-mortem inspections of animals.“The department has a robust regulatory framework and takes regulatory action, where appropriate, for breaches of animal welfare requirements,” a spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsLive exportsAnimal welfareLabor partyAustralian politicsAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Russian army is attempting to create the general impression of a ceasefire, while in some areas still continuing isolated attempts to advance.”Zelenskyy later said Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in an ambush in Toretsk in Donetsk oblast.Video footage from the battlefieldappeared to confirm his claim that the east of the country was under Russian fire. White puffs of smoke could be seen above the village of Uspenivka, in the Pokrovsk area of Donetsk.The Russians also reportedlyattacked an evacuation convoyin the village of Zoria, near the city of Kostiantynivka. At least two civilians and a rescue worker from the Proliska aid agency were hurt when Russian drones targeted their cars.View image in fullscreenA military chaplain sprays holy water on service personnel during an Easter service near the frontline in Donetsk region.Photograph: Anatolii Stepanov/Reuters“For us, it’s just another day of war – with shelling from various types of weapons and even one attempt to assault our positions,” Denys Bobkov, the spokesperson for Ukraine’s 37th separate marine brigade, told the Guardian in a message from the front.Bobkov said that by 2pm on Sunday his brigade had recorded 16 drone attacks and two artillery strikes. It is fighting near the village of Novopavlivka, south-west of Pokrovsk and on the administrative border between Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts.The 66th brigade, based in the city of Lyman, also reported infantry attacks and attempts to repair damaged crossings. “The Russians are using the so-called ‘lull’ to improve their tactical position – to regroup in order to deliver another blow,” it said.In Moscow, Russia’s defence ministry claimed Ukraine had broken the ceasefire more than 1,000 times. It said there had been more than 900 drone strikes, with damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties. It did not give further details.After a bloody week, during which Russiakilled 35 people in a missile attack in the centre of Sumy, Ukrainian cities were relatively calm on Sunday. Worshippers gathered at St Volodymyr’s cathedral in Kyiv, where priests blessed their Easter baskets with Holy water.“They’ve already broken their promise. Unfortunately, we cannot trust Russia today,” Olga Grachova, 38, who works in marketing, told the news agency Agence France-Presse.View image in fullscreenA chaplain conducts an Easter service for soldiers to mark Easter on the frontline in the Zaporizhzhia region.Photograph: Andriy Andriyenko/APThe US has signalled it is losing patience with both sides. On Friday, Donald Trumpsaid he was ready to walk awayfrom his attempt to broker a peace settlement, declaring: “We want to get it done.”“Now if for some reason one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we’re just going to say: ‘You’re foolish. You’re fools. You’re horrible people’ – and we’re going to just take a pass,” he said. The US president denied claims that Putin was “playing” him.Late last night, Trump said on his Truth Social platform that he hoped Ukraine and Russia would make a deal this week and that both would “then start to do big business with the United States of America, which is thriving, and make a fortune”.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio,met European leaders in Parislast week to discuss how to end the war. Leaks suggest the White House is pushing for a Kremlin-friendly deal that would freeze the conflict along the existing 1000km-long frontline.Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, has suggested that Crimea and four other Ukrainian provinces could be given to Russia. The US is considering recognising Crimea as Russian and offering Moscow other incentives such as sanctions relief, Bloomberg reported.The Kremlin insists its original war goals must be achieved. They include the removal of Zelenskyy as Ukraine’s president, as well as the country’s “demilitarisation” and a guarantee of its non-Nato “neutral” status.Since theirdisastrous meeting in Februaryin the Oval Office, Zelenskyy has been seeking to improve relations with Washington. Last month, Ukraineaccepted a 30-day US ceasefire proposaland it is poised to sign an agreement on Thursday giving the US access to its minerals.There are hints, however, that Zelenskyy is growing frustrated at the White House’s pro-Putin rhetoric. Trump has piled pressure on Ukraine – in effect cutting off military aid and temporarily pausing intelligence sharing – while taking no corresponding measures against Russia.On Sunday, Zelenskyy appeared to take a swipe at Fox Television Stations after its Live Now network broadcast live coverage of Putin attending an Orthodox Easter service in Moscow with Russia’s patriarch, while incorrectly labelling Kyiv as part of Russia.“Instead of broadcasting religious service from Moscow, the focus should be on pressuring Moscow to genuinely commit to a full ceasefire and to maintain it for at least 30 days after Easter – to give diplomacy a real chance,” Zelenskyywrote on X.Ukraine’s foreign ministry said it had asked for an explanation. “If this was a mistake rather than a deliberate political statement, there should be an apology and an investigation into who made the mistake,” a ministry spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

This was followed in August 2024 with the deployment of four F-35B jets to Iceland, defending Nato airspace in the north.The RAF’s quick reaction alert forces are based at RAF Coningsby, Lossiemouth, and Brize Norton.Explore more on these topicsMilitaryNatoRoyal Air ForceRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Catalonia, to Ford’s mind, was “no place for the man of pleasure, taste or literature … here cotton is spun, vice and discontent bred, revolution concocted”. He found Valencians “vindictive, sullen, fickle and treacherous”, while reporting that the “better classes” in Murcia “vegetate in a monotonous unsocial existence: their pursuits are the cigar and the siesta”.Ford, whose often acid nib belied a deep love of all things Iberian, is one of 20 British authors profiled in a new Spanish book,Los curiosos impertinentes (“the annoyingly curious”), that explores the UK’s enduring fascination with Spain and reflects on how two centuries of travel writing have shaped the country’s image abroad.The book is prefaced by Ford’s pain quotation and by another, from the late Spanish writer Ramón J Sender: “There’s nothing like a foreigner when it comes to seeing what we’re like.”The writers selected by the book’s author, the British journalist and writer William Chislett, include Ford and his contemporary, the Bible salesman George Borrow, as well as some of their 20th-century successors, among themLaurie Lee, Gerald Brenan, Norman Lewis, VS Pritchett andRobert Graves. Authors from more recent decades are represented byMiranda FranceandGiles Tremlett, and by the late Michael Jacobs, to whom the book is dedicated.View image in fullscreenRobert Graves outside his house on the island of Majorca.Photograph: GRANGER/Historical Picture Archive/Alamy“I deliberately began in the 19th century with Ford and Borrow and didn’t go further back because I felt I had to start somewhere,” says Chislett, who has lived in Spain for almost 40 years. “One could regard Ford’s book as the first travel book … Then we skip forward to the 20th and 21st century for 18 other people, most of whom are absolutely unknown here, let alone in the UK.”The book, which was originally conceived of as an exhibition, is published by the Instituto Cervantes, the governmental organisation tasked with promoting the Spanish language and Hispanic culture.Chislett says there is no escaping the fact that all the books he cites “have forged an image” of the country that has shifted over the centuries.He points out that the old British idea of Spain as a dark, devout place – built on anti-Spanish propaganda and best summed up bythe austere majesty of El Escorial, Philip II’s monastery-cum-palace near Madrid – began to give way to something altogether more wild and romantic in the 19th century. In the aftermath of the peninsula war, Britons began to be seduced by Spain’s history, architecture and culture, and El Escorial had given way to the distant, Islamic splendours ofthe Alhambra in Granada.“It was unknown territory and had all these exotic elements,” adds Chislett. “Word got around that there were all these abandoned castles and flamenco … You’ve got these two contrasts: you’ve got the ‘black legend’ version of Spain and then you’ve got the romantic version of Spain.”Borrow and Ford were followed by Lee, who immortalised Spain on the cusp of civil war inAs I Walked Out One Midsummer Morningand by Lewis, whoseVoices of the Old Seacaptures a dying way of life in Farol, a profoundly superstitious village on the Costa Brava, as fishing gives way to mass tourism.The authors’ reflections also reveal that concerns over what is known today asovertourismare hardly new. Ford, who perhaps did more than most to put Spain on the tourist map, complained that the “implacable march of the European intellectual is crushing many native wildflowers”, while Pritchett later lamented that Spain had been “invaded by tourists”.Equally familiar, as Chislett and others mention, is Spain’s love-hate relationship with how it is viewed through foreign eyes. “Maybe Spaniards are prickly because so much has been written about them,” he says. “I haven’t come to any conclusion, but maybe you could say Spaniards – unjustifiably now, but maybe justifiably during the Franco regime – have an inferiority complex, which I like to think they’ve got rid of totally, given what’s happened over the last 50 years.“In many ways, Spain is way ahead of other European countries.”While Chislett describes the book as a “labour of love” and an attempt to repay Spain for its kindness and hospitality over the past four decades, he hopes it will also introduce Spanish readers to some of the great British travel writers. “There are books earlier than Ford and Borrow, going back to the 18th century,” he adds. “It’s about highlighting this tradition, which still goes on.”In his foreword to the book, the Spanish novelist and travel writer Julio Llamazares advises his compatriots to cast aside their “pride and patriotism” so that they might glimpse themselves anew in its pages.“It’s worth being prepared to accept the foreign gaze or, perhaps more accurately, the foreign gazes, given how many authors have written about us after touring our country and getting to know it,” he writes.“Like English-speaking Quixotes, they paint our portraits with their words, even as they demonstrate their passion for a country and a culture that, despite being so different to their own, has marked them forever and for life.”Explore more on these topicsTravel writingThe ObserverSpainSpain holidaysLaurie LeeRobert GravesGranada holidaysEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Oil prices tumbled to four-year lows of under $60 a barrel after Trump’s tariff announcement, and the International Energy Agency hasslashed its forecasts for global oil demandgrowth by a third for the year ahead.Moody’s said its negative outlook for theIneossubsidiary reflected the risk that it will not make a recovery within the next two years, “with challenging market conditions and uncertainty related to trade barriers”.The spiralling losses at Ineos Quattro over recent years stand in contrast to the €2.3bn profit it made in 2022 from manufacturing petrochemicals at its 45 sites across the Americas,Europeand Asia.Ratcliffe has blamed high energy costs, “the deindustrialisation of Europe” and “extreme carbon taxes” for the change in fortunes for the Ineos empire, which is made up of about 30 distinct companies that together operate more than 170 sites across 32 countries.Ineos Group, the empire’s main corporate unit, revealed earlier this month that it would not pay out any dividends to its owners – Ratcliffe, Andy Currie and John Reece – so that the cash can be reinvested in the business, in an example of “discipline and prudent financial management”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Holy See studies the person’s life, and keeps watch for the miracles necessary to secure a spot among the beatific.Acutis was put on the path afterPope Francis approved a miracle attributed to him: a seven-year-old boy from Brazil recovered from a rare pancreatic disorder after coming into contact with one of Acutis’s T-shirts. A priest had also prayed to Acutis on behalf of the child.If a person undergoes an unexpected recovery, it can be classed as a miracle by the Vatican. If two miracles are attributed to a deceased person and approved by the pope, then they qualify for sainthood.Acutis’s sainthood was confirmed when the pope approved the second miracle: a 21-year-old student in Costa Rica made a swift recovery after head trauma from a serious bicycle accident after her mother prayed for her daughter’s recovery at Acutis’s tomb in the Umbrian town of Assisi.As part of the pathway, Acutis’s body was moved to the hill town of Assisi in centralItaly, in line with his last wishes, since he admired Saint Francis.Acutis was entombed in Santa Maria Maggiore church with a wax mould of his likeness placed over his body, wearing his blue tracksuit top, jeans and trainers.Ever since, crowds have been gathering at the clear-sided casket. Tens of thousands more are expected to attend the canonisation service on 27 April. Vatican officials hope that the pope, who is recovering from a serious bout of double pneumonia, will preside.Out of 912 people canonised by Pope Francis, the most recent birth date was previously 1926.Acutis was born in London in 1991 before moving to Milan with his Italian parents, Andrea Acutis and Antonia Salzano, as a child.Salzano previously told the newspaper Corriere della Sera that from the age of three her son would ask to visit churches they passed in Milan and would donate his pocket money to poor people in the city.She said Acutis would also offer to support classmates whose parents were going through divorces, would defend disabled peers when they were bullied and would take meals and sleeping bags to rough sleepers in Milan.She told Reuters that he was special, but also shared the same anxieties about fitting in as any other teenager: “Carlo was an ordinary child like [others]. He used to play, to have friends, and to go to school. But his extraordinary quality was the fact that he opened the door of his heart to Jesus and put Jesus in the first place in his life.”She said her son lived an ascetic life in which he would not allow himself more than one pair of shoes at a time.Explore more on these topicsCatholicismChristianityReligionItalyEuropeprofilesShareReuse this content"

The UN said theyhad been killed “one by one”. Israel at first claimed that the medics’ vehicles did not have emergency signals on when troops opened fire but later backtracked after phone video recovered from one of the medics contradicted the account.The Gaza paramedic killings: a visual timelineRead moreOn Sunday, the military said an investigation had “identified several professional failures, breaches of orders, and a failure to fully report the incident”.As a result, the deputy commander ofthe IDF’s Golani Brigade“will be dismissed from his position due to his responsibilities as the field commander … and for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief”.Another commander, whose unit was in operation in the southern city of Rafah, where the killings took place, would be censured for “his overall responsibility for the incident”, the military said.0:15Bodies of health workers pulled from the burial site – videoDespite admitting mistakes, the report does not recommend any criminal action to be taken against the military units responsible for the incident and found no violation of the IDF’s code of ethics. The findings of the report will now be passed along to the military advocate general. Israel’s extreme-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, called the army chief’s decision to dismiss the responsible deputy commander “a grave mistake”.The Palestine Red Crescent rejected the findings.“The report is full of lies. It is invalid and unacceptable, as it justifies the killing and shifts responsibility to a personal error in the field command when the truth is quite different,” Nebal Farsakh, spokesperson for the Red Crescent, told AFP.Human rights lawyers also called the inquiry into question, pointing out that it had been done by Israel’s military itself and alleging it lacked independence.Sawsan Zaher, a Palestinian human rights lawyer based in Israel, said: “There is nothing objective or neutral about this inquiry. The severity of this case should have led to an immediate criminal investigation. Instead we see the Israeli military inquiring into itself and yet again evidence of violations of international law and war crimes are swept under the carpet.”The report maintains, without providing further evidence, that six of the 15 Palestinians killed were Hamas militants. Previous claims by Israel along the same lines have been denied by the Red Crescent.The investigation provided the most thorough account from Israel’s forces about what they alleged took place that night. According to the report, it was an “operational misunderstanding” by Israeli forces that led them to fire on the ambulances. They denied that there had been any “indiscriminate fire” and claimed troops were simply alert to “real threats” from Hamas on the ground, accusing the militant group of regularly using ambulances to transport weapons and terrorists.The investigation claimed that “poor night visibility” was to blame for the deputy battalion commander’s conclusion that the ambulances belonged to Hamas militants and the decision to fire on them.Video footage that emergedfrom the scene showed that the ambulances were clearly moving with flashing emergency lights.View image in fullscreenA still from a phone video taken by one of the medics killed, showing Red Crescent emergency vehicles with lights and sirens flashing and their logos clearly visible.Photograph: APThe investigation also found that the shooting of a UN vehicle, which drove past 15 minutes later, was carried out in violation of orders.Daniel Machover, a human rights lawyer who co-founded Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights, said the admission of the circumstances of the killing of the UN worker, who was in a clearly marked UN vehicle, “alone should be grounds for a court martial and a war crimes investigation, not simply a dismissal”.After uncovering the bodies from a sandy grave in Gaza days after the attack, a UN official said the workers had been killed “one by one”, while the head of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society has said the men were “targeted at close range”.Some witnesses and relatives have also alleged there was evidence that at least one of the victims hadhad their hands bound.‘What was their crime?’ Families tell of shock over IDF killing of Gaza paramedicsRead moreThe military’s report said there was “no evidence to supportclaims of executionor that any of the deceased were bound before or after the shooting”. Ahmed Dhair, the forensic pathologist in Gaza who carried out the postmortems on the victims, said last week that he had not seen visible signs of restraint.The Israeli military also defended the decision by soldiers to “evacuate” the bodies the next morning and claimed that while the decision to crush their vehicles was wrong, “there was no attempt to hide the incident”.Dhair told the Guardian last week that the postmortems showed the victims were mostly killedby gunshots to the head and torso, as well as injuries caused by explosives. Dhair alleged evidence of “explosive bullets” in the bodies he had examined.The Israeli statement on the findings concluded by saying that Israel’s military “regrets the harm caused to uninvolved civilians”. Asked if he thought the incident represented a pervasive issue within the Israeli military, Maj Gen Yoav Har-Even, who headed the inquiry, told journalists: “We’re saying it was a mistake, we don’t think it’s a daily mistake.”Last week, Palestinian Red Crescent said that one of the two Palestinian paramedics who had survived the shooting, Assad al-Nsasrah,remained in Israeli detention.View image in fullscreenTheir bodies were uncovered days after the shooting, buried in a sandy mass grave alongside their crushed vehicles.Photograph: PRCSPalestinians and international human rights groups have repeatedly accused Israel’s military of failing to properly investigate or whitewashing misconduct by its troops. A recentreport by Yesh Din, an Israeli human rights organisation, concluded that Israel “did not take appropriate action to investigate suspected violations of international law that occurred as part of its war in Gaza”.Ziv Stahl, the executive director of Yesh Din, said: “It’s another example of the almost full impunity given to soldiers for events in Gaza. In this case, I think they were quick to handle it because of the international pressure they are facing. By taking this small disciplinary action against one commander, it undermines any chance of a wider criminal investigation.”The international criminal court, established by the international community as a court of last resort, has accused the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the former defence minister Yoav Gallantof war crimes. Israel, which is not a member of the court, has long asserted that its legal system is capable of investigating the army, and Netanyahu has accused the ICC of antisemitism.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Further technical talks are due in Geneva this week, followed by another high-level diplomatic meeting next weekend in Oman.Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who was at the heart of the Rome talks, wants an agreement wrapped up within 60 days, but is likely to face resistance from Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, who believes the levels of distrust and the technical nature of the talks make such a swift agreement unlikely.The two most daunting issues are the storage or destruction of Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium, and the external guarantees that can be provided to Iran if the US was to breach an agreement to lift economic sanctions in return for Iran putting its civil nuclear programme back under external supervision by the UN inspectorate, the IAEA. Iran wants a guarantee of consequences for the US if it pulls out of or breaches another deal.Iran wants to keep its uranium stockpiles inside the country, but the US rejects this and wants either the stockpiles’ destruction or a transfer to a third country, such as Russia.Iran believes it has received assurances that the US objective is not the entire dismantling of its nuclear programme. Before the Rome talks, in an intervention that sowed confusion in Iran and the US, Witkoff had on social media seemed to endorse such an objective, causing consternation in Iran, but in Rome he gave the impression that this was largely domestic political messaging.Mohamed Amersi, a member of the advisory board at the Wilson Center, a Washington thinktank, said: “From the Iranian perspective there had been some conflicting messages on social media and in interviews about the US wanting the complete elimination of their nuclear programme and that was not at all what Araghchi had agreed, so the first assurance was that there had been no expansion in the US objectives. If he had not got that assurance it’s likely the whole negotiation would have been wrapped up, and ended immediately.”On guarantees, Iran believes the only secure agreement is a treaty signed by US Congress, but Araghchi was told it would be anyone’s guess whether Trump could get such an agreement through Congress given the strength of pro-Israeli opinion there.Another option is for the US to agree to cover Tehran’s losses if Washington were to pull out of a deal. The Iranians floated the idea of a financial penalty before, but the enforcement mechanism in the absence of a treaty remains problematic. A third option if the US is in breach is for Russia to be empowered to return the handed-over stockpile of highly enriched uranium to Tehran, so ensuring Iran would not be the party punished for non-compliance.Such an arrangement potentially gives Russia a pivotal role in the future US-Iran relationship, and might freeze out Germany, France and the UK, the current guarantors of the 2015 agreement. Neither Iran nor the US want to keep a major future role for the UN.Rome was seen by some as an important site for the talks, since if they went wrong the Italian prime minister,Giorgia Meloni, has the best relations with Trump, and so was well placed to mount a rescue operation. A tentative proposal for a meeting between Araghchi and the US vice-president, JD Vance, who was in Rome, was seen as premature.There is pressure on Witkoff and Trump to deliver on one of the three negotiations in which they are involved – Iran, Hamas-Israel, and Russia-Ukraine. One source said: “Whatever you may think of Iran, they are rational actors, and they are more likely to strike a deal.”Iran’s negotiating position was strengthened before the talks by the visit of the Saudi defence minister to Tehran to see the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The visit was intended as a message of solidarity that it opposes and would not collaborate in any US-Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear sites.The Omani foreign ministry said the goal of the talks was to reach “a fair, sustainable and binding agreement … to ensure that Iran is completely free of nuclear weapons and sanctions, while preserving its right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes”.Explore more on these topicsIran's nuclear programmeIran nuclear dealIranNuclear weaponsMiddle East and north AfricaRussiaOmannewsShareReuse this content"

They had lost their baby after a bombing and were unable to take Al Hamwi’s mother, Soaad Al Shawa, with them.The couple were granted refugee status in the UK and applied to bring Al Shawa, 57, to the UK under the refugee family reunion scheme, but were rejected.They live in Glasgow with their three children aged seven, five and one. Al Shawa has never met her grandchildren and has been able to communicate with them only on video calls. Last year, she was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer and in November was given about six months to live by doctors in Syria.Another application for refugee family reunion was made after the terminal cancer diagnosis, which was rejected by the Home Office.The family appealed and a judge in the first tier tribunal of the immigration court granted the appeal in April, citing article 8 of the European convention on human rights, which relates to the right to family life.The family were overjoyed and relayed the news to Al Shawa, who began to make preparations to come to the UK. The plan was for Al Shawa’s neighbours to take her to neighbouring Jordan or Lebanon where Amonajid, 36, could meet her and bring her to the UK. Because Al Hamwi and Amonajid are refugees they cannot re-enter Syria to be with Al Shawa there.“My mum really perked up when she heard the news and started to eat more,” said Al Hamwi, 35. “All she wants to do before she dies is to see us and the kids.”But the family were devastated when on 10 April the Home Office requested permission to appeal to a higher court against the judge’s ruling. These appeals are taking an average of eight months to be heard.As part of the Home Office’s appeal it is citing a case quoted by judges in the case of a family from Gaza to whom they granted permission to come to the UK. The casecaused a furoreamong politicians and sections of the media. The prime minister said he wanted to close a legal “loophole” relating to the case.Al Hamwi said: “There isn’t much time. If we can get her here we will provide everything for her. When the Home Office asked for permission to appeal against the decision of the judge who said my mum could come here they didn’t think about how they are breaking my heart.“My message to the Home Office is ‘please help my mum to see us before she dies’. We haven’t told my mum that Home Office has asked to appeal against the decision for her to come to the UK.”The family’s solicitor, Usman Aslam of Mukhtar & Co Solicitors, said: “We could feel the family’s relief when they won the appeal, then their horror that the Home Office have sought permission to appeal. We immediately sought an expedition of their permission application.“I have written to the Home Office directly expressing my outrage. Whilst I fully respect their right to seek permission to appeal, it is regrettable they have chosen this case of a dying woman. We are hoping that the Home Office will show compassion and allow her to spend what little time she has left with her family.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “It would be inappropriate to comment while legal proceedings are ongoing.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumSyriaMiddle East and north AfricaScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

It will also be seeking to build three new sites to add “resilience and support our ramp-up of critical munitions production”.According to John Healey, the defence secretary, the defence industry “is the foundation of our ability to fight and win on the battlefield”.He said: “Strengthening homegrown artillery production is an important step in learning the lessons from Ukraine, boosting our industrial resilience and making defence an engine for growth.”BAE Systems said it has developed new methods to create the new weapons, describing it as an “innovative” way to keep up with demand while removing the need for nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine, which are high in demand across global supply chains.Previously, the company imported RDX explosives from two main sources, the US and France. However, it wants to be in a place where its munitions are deemed to be “Itar-free”, meaning it can be bought and sold on without anyrestrictions from the US.Steve Cardew, the business development director at BAE Systems’ maritime and land defence solutions, said: “Our leap forward in synthetic energetics and propellant manufacture will strengthen the UK’s supply chain resilience and support our ramp up of critical munitions production to meet growing demand in response to the increasingly uncertain world we’re living in.“It also supports economic growth through high-skilled jobs and potential export opportunities.”Explore more on these topicsDefence policyMilitaryBAE SystemsWeapons technologynewsShareReuse this content"

But senior managers are behaving no differently to those running private water companies south of the border.”Scottish Water said it “did not recognise” the figures cited by Unison and said that the offer of 3.4% with a guaranteed increase of £1,400 would spell a 5.5% rise for the lowest-paid.It said contingency plans were in place to enable it to maintain normal services during the strikes and advised customers to report any problems with the water as usual.Peter Farrer, Scottish Water’s chief operating officer, said the offer was “fair and progressive”, adding: “No one benefits from industrial action, and our focus is on continuing to deliver for our millions of customers across Scotland. We urge the unions to get back round the negotiating table as soon as possible.”Unlike in England, the water boards in Scotland were never privatised, and Scottish Water has said that it reinvests all profits, currently about £800m a year, directly back into its infrastructure, a network of 30,000 miles of pipes and about 2,000 treatment works.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the party estimated that the real number of 24-hour cases was likely to be far higher because only 54 out of 141 trusts had provided full data.TheRoyal College of Nursing(RCN) said the figures “only begin to scratch the surface” of a “crisis in corridor care” – after reports of patients being seen in the corridors of hospitals due to a lack of beds. The RCN said the declining recruitment in nursing was adding to the problem.“The NHS and the UK government must begin to disclose the true scale of the problem if they’re serious about eradicating it,” general secretary and chief executive of the RCN Prof Nicola Ranger said. “A single patient waiting for more than 24 hours is unacceptable, tens of thousands waiting shows why corridor care must be eradicated. It is undignified and unsafe, and now a year-round crisis.The Lib Dems want the government to make a new team of “super-heads”, composed of experienced NHS bosses who would go into struggling trusts and bring them up to standard.“The least patients deserve is the dignity to be treated in an appropriate area,” Lib Dem health and social care spokesperson Helen Morgan said. “Not the ramshackle waiting rooms and corridors that far too many have to suffer through for hours.“That is why the government must ensure that this is the last winter crisis anyone will experience and end corridor care by the end of this parliament.“The Conservatives’ beyond-shameful neglect brought us to this point, but theLabourgovernment’s approach of sitting on its hands and hoping it all gets better has not survived contact with reality.”The current Labour government has made cutting NHS waiting lists one of its key missions.“We have taken action to protect A&E departments, introducing the new RSV vaccine, delivering more than 27m Covid and flu vaccines and ending the strikes so staff were on the frontline not the picket line for the first winter in three years,” a Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said.“This work continues to ensure patients are treated quickly. We are fundamentally reforming the NHS as part of our Plan for Change, providing more care in the community, so fewer patients have to go to A&E, and those who do are treated faster and with dignity.”A spokesperson for East Kent hospitals trust said: “We have seen increased attendances across our three main hospitals and we are sorry that patients are waiting longer than we would like in our emergency departments.”UniversityHospitalsof Liverpool group has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsNHSHospitalsHealthLiberal DemocratsLabourEnglandRoyal College of NursingnewsShareReuse this content"

Some trials have had shipping costs alone increase to 10 times since Brexit.The extra rules and costs have had a “significant negative impact” on UK cancer research, creating “new barriers” that are “holding back life-saving research” for Britons, the report says.In some cases, the impact has been devastating. Children are among the NHS cancer patients whose tumours have returned or treatment has stopped working, leaving them in limbo and denied drugs that could extend or save their lives, senior doctors told the Guardian.Sources said officials in the Cabinet Office and the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology were studying the findings of the review.It cites evidence from a range of leading clinicians, scientists and researchers, and was compiled by experts from organisations includingCancerResearch UK, the University of Southampton, and Hatch, a research consultancy.In a statement, the government said clinical trials were vital to millions of Britons with long-term conditions for whom limited treatments were available in routine care, including cancer patients for whom routine therapies were ineffective.Ministers were committed to “strengthening” the UK’s relationship with the EU on research, and the government offered “extensive support” for UK researchers to help them secure funding, a spokesperson added.Three areas of UK cancer research have been hit particularly hard by its departure from the EU, according to the report. They are the regulatory environment for clinical trials, the mobility of the cancer research workforce and access to research funding and collaboration.Clinical trial groups and universities are struggling to attract “global talent” in cancer research to come to Britain, with UK patients missing out on the expertise of the world’s top cancer scientists.At the same time, UK researchers are finding it “more difficult” to attract grant funding to explore new ways to save the lives of patients “due to additional bureaucracy since the UK left the EU”.The report also reveals the UK is needlessly duplicating drug testing in clinical trials involving the UK and EU, with extra checks causing potentially deadly delays.In one case, the UK had to spend an extra £22,000 for an official to certify batches of aspirin for use in a cancer trial. Aspirin is one of the world’s most familiar drugs and the batches had already been checked in the EU.Meanwhile, Brexit is having a wider, damaging effect on life-saving research in the EU, the report adds. “The exclusion of UK researchers from European cancer research activities has had, and will continue to have, negative consequences for the overall European cancer research effort,” it says.Leading experts shown the report by the Guardian said the harm Brexit had inflicted on UK cancer research and NHS patients had been inevitable and predicted to occur.“Those of us who understood the EU warned repeatedly about precisely these concerns,” said Dr Martin McKee, a professor of European PublicHealthat the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. “These findings are not just predictable, they were predicted.”He added: “It was always inevitable that Brexit would lead to costly duplication and barriers to collaboration.”Mark Dayan, the Brexit programme lead at the Nuffield Trust, a health thinktank, said the report highlighted “concrete examples” of “disruptions which many warned were inevitable from the moment that we left the EU with a relatively hard Brexit for health and research”.The UK and EU are due to renew the trade and cooperation agreement this year, and discuss a wider reset which will shape the future UK-EU relationship.Keir Starmer should make the case for “a new pact to protect health”, Dayan said, “cutting back pointless post-Brexit red tape on medicines testing and research approvals by being willing to cooperate and offer guarantees”.The report recommends the creation of a mutual recognition agreement for testing medicines, to cut costs for researchers leading cross-border trials. Without it, patients will experience further delays to trials in future, denying them access to potentially life-saving treatments, it says.A government spokesperson said: “We are strengthening our relationship with the EU on research and have been providing extensive support for researchers to help them secure funding from the £80bn Horizon Europe programme and get more vital treatments from the lab to patients.”Last year, theGuardian revealedhow hundreds of thousands of people in the UK were being forced to wait months to begin even basic cancer treatment, such as surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, with deadly delays “routine” and even children denied timely care.Explore more on these topicsCancer researchBrexitMedical researchCancerNHSDrugsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Children and young people with cancer cannot wait.”Marshall, a consultant in paediatric and adolescent oncology and clinical research lead at the Royal Marsden hospital and the Institute of Cancer Research, said delays to UK arms of trials were also harming cancer patients in other countries.“Data from these trials is used around the world to deliverbetter, kinder treatments. Delays anywhere affect every child and young person with cancer,” she added.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now, bespoke shipping is needed from Spain to Ireland to avoid sending items for Irish trials through the UK.“This new shipping arrangement costs 10 times the pre-Brexit amount,” the report says. “Over the course of the trial, the extra shipping costs are anticipated to be £25,000.”Explore more on these topicsBrexitEuropean UnionCancerChildren's healthnewsShareReuse this content"

Two were seriously injured after being doused in hot cooking fat and stabbed, one five times in the torso, in a sustained assault.The body representing prison officers will call for all staff to have stab vests, and also for electric stun guns for selected officers. It will also demand that an American “Supermax”-style regime is imposed on Britain’s worst inmates.The Prison Officers’ Association (POA) wants electric stun guns issued to specialist teams in at least the highest-security prisons, to quell attacks that threaten the lives of officers.The devices fire 50,000 volts to incapacitate a suspect, and are billed as a less lethal option than firearms, though some uses have been linked to deaths.Abedi, 28, the brother of the Manchester Arena bomber, Salman, is serving a 55-year sentence. The attack on the three officers happened in a kitchen area of the separation unit at HMP Frankland.Mark Fairhurst, the chair of the POA, said: “We now need the tactical use of Taser as an option when faced with life-threatening situations. The threat in our prisons is such that we need that option available.”Police officers across the UK can be issued with electric stun guns to use on the streets if they perceive sufficient threat.Fairhurst said electric stun guns should be available for those guarding terrorists and other seriously violent convicted criminals when prison officers believed their livesor those of their colleagues were at risk.He said: “Say staff are getting attacked by someone with a sharp-edged weapon, who is trying to kill them. All we have available at the moment is pava spray [similar to pepper spray] and a baton. When I call for assistance, what we need is a response team to turn up who have the option of using Taser.“A sharp-edged weapon is as deadly as a knife. The idea we are going to fight them off with a baton and a canister of spray is putting my members’ lives at risk. You can’t run away, you are in an enclosed environment.”The POA is asking for electric stun guns first to be given to response teams at the highest-security prisons, which all have separation units or their equivalent, for prisoners deemed to be highly dangerous or disruptive.Those prisons include Frankland, where the attack took place on Saturday 12 April; Belmarsh, where Abedi had previously attacked officers; Full Sutton; Long Lartin and Whitemoor.The meeting on Wednesday afternoon will be between the POA and Mahmood. Fairhurst said parts of prisons with the ultimate security should adopt “Supermax” rules.In this plan, selected high-risk inmates would leave their cell only when handcuffed and escorted by three staff, there would be no mixing with other prisoners, and they would be restricted to their basic entitlement of rights and privileges.Fairhurst said: “It’s called a separation centre for a reason. We’re just treating them like everyone else.”He said the set of demands was reasonable and that he was hopeful, adding that the strength of feeling was such that the government would be “foolish not to consider them”.The Ministry of Justice did not comment on whether it would consider issuing Tasers to some prison officers. The government has announced a review and has already banned inmates in separation units having access to knives orbeing allowed to prepare meals in kitchens.“This will look into how this was able to happen, and what we must do to better protect our prison officers in the future,” Mahmood said on Friday.The attacks are being investigated by counter-terrorism police because of Abedi’s past. They have searched the prison looking for where and how the makeshift blade was made, and signs of violent Islamist extremist literature.Also in the separation unit at HMP Frankland wasAnjem Choudary, serving life imprisonment after being convicted of directing a terrorist organisation, membership of a proscribed organisation, and encouraging support for a terrorist organisation.Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationShabana MahmoodUK criminal justiceTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

Phil Hegseth, the secretary’s younger brother, was hired as a senior Pentagon adviser and is the defense department’s liaison to the Department of Homeland Security. It is unclear why either would need to know about the details of strikes plans in advance.According to the Times, Hegseth used his private phone, rather than a government device, to access the Signal chat with his family and friends.CNNreported later on Sundaythat three sources familiar with Hegseth’s private Signal group confirmed to the broadcaster that he had used it to share Yemen attack plans before the strikes were launched.A person familiar with the contents and those who received the messages, confirmed the second chat to the Associated Press ands said that it included 13 people.Shortly after the news of the second Signal chat broke, Politico published an opinion article by Hegseth’s former press secretary, John Ullyot,who wrote: “It’s been a month of total chaos at the Pentagon. From leaks of sensitive operational plans to mass firings, the dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president – who deserves better from his senior leadership”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationPete HegsethSignal group chat leakUS politicsUS militaryUS national securitynewsShareReuse this content"

After decades of investment in science and innovation, she said: “intellectual assets are being given away.”In the past week, the US president cut offbillions of dollars to Harvardin federal funds, after the universityrefused to concedeto a number of the administration’s demands. Trump alsocalled for its tax-exempt status to be revoked, a potentially illegal move, against the world-famous college in Cambridge, Massachusetts.The Trump-Harvard showdown is the latest front in a long conservative war against academiaRead moreOf the moves against colleges, Healey said: “It’s bad for patients, it’s bad for science, and it’s really bad for American competitiveness. There’s no way a state can make up for the cuts from federal funding.”She added: “I was in a hospital recently, Boston Children’s, where some of the sickest kids in the country receive care. Cuts to Boston Children’s and other hospitals are a direct result of Donald Trump’s actions, as these are part of a teaching hospital system.“These cuts to universities have significant ripple effects, resulting in layoffs of scientists and doctors, and clinical trials for cancer treatments have been shut down.“As governor, I wantMassachusettsand America to soar. What Donald Trump is doing is essentially inviting other countries, like China, to take our scientists and researchers. This is terrible, especially considering what he has done to the economy. I am working hard every day to lower costs in my state, cut taxes, and build more housing, while Donald Trump is making life more expensive and harder for all of us.”Since Trump took office, his administration has deployed an “antisemitism taskforce” to demand various policy changes at different universities around the country.Columbia University, one of the first institutions targeted by the taskforce, quicklycaved to the Trump administration’s demandsto restore$400m in federal funding. Some of the measures that Columbia conceded to included banning face masks on campus, empowering security officers to arrest people, and placing control of the Middle Eastern department under a new senior vice-provost.Former Columbia University president Lee Bollinger said on Sunday that the Trump administration’s attacks on academic institutions represent a significant attack on first amendment rights.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After the university publicly rejected those demands, the administration quickly froze nearly $2.3bn in federal funding.The conflict between the administration and the elite university took a strange turn on Friday, with the New York Times reporting that an 11 April letter from the administration with additional demands – which escalated the showdown – was “unauthorized”.

The New York Timesfirst reported on the draft.The US state department disputed the report, with a spokesperson telling Newsweek that the reporting is “entirely based on a fake document”.Earlier on Sunday, the US secretary of state Marco Rubio called the reported overhaul “fake news” in aposton X. “The ⁦nytimes falls victim to another hoax.”The proposals reportedly also include the elimination of the Bureau of International Organizations, which liaises with the United Nations and a cut in diplomatic operations in Canada.Under the changes, the sprawling state department would be reorganized into four regional bureaus covering Indo-Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East and Eurasia. But an unspecified number of “non-essential” embassies and consulates in Sub-Saharan Africa would be closed.The New York Times said the proposal executive order could be signed byDonald Trumpthis week and the changes would take effect by 1 October.The order is designed to impose “a disciplined reorganization” of the state department and “streamline mission delivery” while cutting “waste, fraud and abuse”, the outlet quoted from the document.If the proposals happened, they would be a significant rejection of the US commitment to a multilateral world order.Trump news at a glance: Mass anti-Trump protests sweep nation; supreme court issues midnight orderRead moreA senior diplomatic official in Africa said information circulating within the state department about foreign service reforms that are set to be announced would be less sweeping than those described in the document.One poster on a US foreign service-dedicated Reddit page said they doubted that the changes would go as far as the draft order. “I suspect this is being leaked as a red herring designed to make us grateful for a more modest but still unpopular reorganization,” wrote one user. “It will be basically immediately challenged and enjoined, and then ‘implementation’ will be dragged out until Trump is voted out.”Still, any radical reorganization of the US foreign operations comes after theTrump administrationmoved to fold the US Agency for International Development (USAID) into the state department, cut operations, and then reinstate some, including programs for emergency food assistance.The bureau of humanitarian affairs would “assume any mission-critical duties previously carried out by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)”, the order reads.The draft order leaked on Sunday would eliminate the Bureau of African Affairs, the special envoy for climate, the Bureau of International Organizations, and the Office of Global Women’s Issues.“Diplomatic relations with Canada shall fall under a significantly reduced team delegated as the North American Affairs Office (NAAO) within the Office of the Secretary,” according to the document. That includes a substantial downsizing of the US embassy in the capital, Ottawa.The shake-up would also see US diplomatic staff assigned to regions for the duration of their careers rather than be deployed in rotations around the world. State department-awarded Fulbright scholarships would be reformed as “solely for master’s-level study in national security-related disciplines” with emphasis placed in “critical” languages.Fellowships associated with historically Black Howard University in Washington, would also be cancelled as part of the administration’s effort to end diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.“All positions and duties must receive explicit written approval from the President of the United States,” according to the order, which also calls for ending the foreign service exam for aspiring diplomats. The new criteria for hiring, it said, includes “alignment with the president’s foreign policy vision”.But the order is not the only internal document circulating to propose changes to US diplomatic operations. Another proposes a 50% reduction in the state department budget, and a third calls for the cutting 10 embassies and 17 consulates.The US state department workforce includes 13,000 members of the foreign service, 11,000 civil service employees, and 45,000 locally employed staff at more than 270 diplomatic missions worldwide,according toits website.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

It was that the move represented, for the time being, a step back for theTrump administrationin what some believe is part of a wider attempt to overhaul US democracy at large.“It’s as dangerous as anything I’ve ever experienced in my lifetime,” said Todd Wolfson, the president of the American Association of University Professors.“They’re attempting to undermine and destabilize and ultimately control higher education. And at one level, it’s an assault on higher education, at another level, it could be seen as prevalent to a full-on assault on democracy. So I think this is a threat to the future of the United States of America, and because of this country’s role in the world, a threat to the entirety of the globe at this moment.”The government said on Mondayit planned to freeze$2.2bn in grants and $60m in multi-year contract value to Harvard, hours after Alan Garber, the university president,said Harvard would not accepta series of demandsmade by the Trump administration. The demands included appointing a White House-approved external body to “to audit the student body, faculty, staff, and leadership for viewpoint diversity”, and that Harvard “immediately shutter all diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs”.Garber said the government’s edicts “represent direct governmental regulation” of the school’s independence and constitutional rights.“No government – regardless of which party is in power – should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,” Garber wrote in an open letter, which was hailed by the left and by college professors concerned at the capitulation of other schools.Yet, as evidenced by Trump’s emotionalposton Wednesday, the government’s assault on universities is unlikely to stop anytime soon, particularly if he is to emulate the kind of strongman leaders,such as the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, he has praised in the past.“[People in the Trump administration] have read their history, and they know that authoritarian regimes often target higher education as an independent sector and society, and aim to undermine it because of its role in creating an educated populace that could stand up to all forms of authoritarian rule,” Wolfson said.The Trump administration is following the playbook of totalitarian dictatorships elsewhere in the worldSteven Pinker“And so this is part of a standard playbook of authoritarianism: to attack and to attempt to control or destroy higher education.”The move against universities has echoes of the efforts by the Wisconsin senator Joseph McCarthy in the middle of the 20th century to root out people he accused of being communists and Marxists. And like McCarthy, Trump’s efforts – led by a group of loyalists including the White House deputy chief of staff and head of policy, Stephen Miller – go beyond just universities. Trump has targeted some of the biggest law firms in the US with executive orders,prompting many to caveand pledge hundreds of millions of dollars of pro bono work to causes backed by the Trump administration.“The Trump administration is following the playbook of totalitarian dictatorships elsewhere in the world. It is trying to use the force of law to intimidate independent civic society organizations, so that opposition to its policies is impossible,” said Steven Pinker, a psychology professor at Harvard and co-chair of the university’s Council on Academic Freedom.If Harvard, armor-plated by history and padded with funds, can’t beat Trump, no one canRead more“This new incarnation of the American right wing, with complete fealty to a single man, and an unprecedented attempt to disable civic society institutions like law firms and universities, is quite extraordinary.”The Trump administration has framed its move on Harvard and other colleges as an effort to crackdown on antisemitism, following protests against Israel’s war on Gaza, and as a move against alleged civil rights violations on campus. Few outside of the rightwing sphere see that as a good faith argument.“As a Jewish faculty member, I’m sensitive to antisemitism on campus, and it does exist and it should be combated. But the claim that Harvard is a bastion of antisemitism is just wild hyperbole. Three of our last four presidents who’ve served longer than a year have been Jewish. The fourth was married to a Jewish professor,” Pinker said.Harvard has found itself in the Trump administration’s crosshairs because of its status as the best known of America’s universities, one of the eight esteemed Ivy League schools. Thousands of influential figures across politics, media and business attended Harvard’s grand campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts; many of those who didn’t go to Harvard still tend to take an interest in its affairs.“We’ve got between 4,000 and 5,000 higher education institutions in the US. The Ivys always make headlines. The major cultural commentators in this country are obsessed with the Ivys, and have been for a long time. These are things that sell papers, they get a lot of clicks and a lot of attention,” said Lauren Lassabe Shepherd, a historian of US colleges and universities and the author of Resistance from the Right: Conservatives and the Campus Wars.“The other thing, too, is what happens at your regional state public flagship university often follows from the trends that are set at the Ivys. Not only do they generate a lot of headlines, they are influential in that way.”Just as Harvard’s existence predates the founding of the US, rightwing antipathy towards universities has been brewing for a long time. When Ronald Reagan was running for governor of California in 1966, he used anger towards anti-Vietnam student protesters for political gain: one of his main campaign strands was a promise to “clean up the mess at Berkeley” – the state’s flagship university.Reagan’s tactics bear echoes of Trump’s. Ray Colvig, UC Berkeley’s chief public information officer at the time, toldthe university’s news serviceyears later that Reagan “wanted to establish a special process to select faculty in several disciplines”.“In other words, he wanted to set a political standard for appointing faculty members. This idea was widely opposed, and it went away,” Colvig said.Reagan wasn’t the first to take on the universities. Shepherd said efforts to set up rival, conservative universities, date back to the 1920s, while McCarthy’s war on higher education came later. Ellen Schrecker, a historian and author of No Ivory Tower: McCarthyism and the Universities, wrote in the Nation recently that the Trump administration’s efforts were “worse than McCarthy”, and Shepherd said Trump’s attacks were “much more accelerated” than the communist-paranoid senator’s tactics.“McCarthyism, in the 1940s and 50s, the idea was to identify specific professors, hardly ever students, always faculty, and have them fired. Today, we’re seeing much worse than that. These are attacks on entire programs and departments. So entire departments like Black studies or DEI initiatives. It’s also not just relegated to the professors. We’re seeing students with their visas revoked being literally plucked off the streets,” Shepherd said.Trump hasn’t just targeted Harvard. Columbia Universitycaved to a series of demandsfrom the Trump administration in March, as a pre-condition forrestoring $400m in federal funding, while the White Househas announcedfunding freezes to other schools including Brown, Northwestern, Princeton and Cornell.What would it mean for Trump to revoke Harvard’s tax-exempt status?Read moreHarvard taking a stand is one of the first signs of a fight back – even if it came after it wasreported in Marchthat the leaders of the university’s center for Middle Eastern studies were forced out, a move seen by critics as an attempt to appease Trump – and academics and others hope itcould begin a resistance. It is likely to require a group effort to avoid the right wing’s goal for higher education in the US: universities that are in effect government-controlled, and where freedom of speech and thought is restricted.“The right don’t want students to hear about the legacy to slavery. They don’t want them to hear about structural inequalities,” Shepherd said.“They don’t want to hear why billionaires are bad. They don’t want to hear, from the sciences, about climate change. They want a nice, friendly experience where the most students ever get to debate is the differences in Aristotle and Plato.“They don’t want the actual debates that we see unfolding on campuses today.”Explore more on these topicsUS universitiesTrump administrationHarvard UniversityDonald TrumpRonald ReaganUS politicsRepublicansanalysisShareReuse this content"

Just last week Bloomberg reported a cut in spending athair stylists. There’s the “lipstick index” – in tough economic times, women load up on lipstick instead of spending their dwindling funds on bigger-ticket items. Former Fed chair Alan Greenspan liked to followmen’s underwear salesbecause hey, when times are tough, we guys are not willing to buy new shorts.There’s little empirical evidence that any of these metrics mean anything. And it’s next to impossible to gather accurate data to even measure these things. Are you getting a report from the men’s underwear industry? No, I didn’t think so.Worried about your stock market savings as Trump tariffs wreak havoc? Don’t panicRead moreThe media likes to advertise other well-known metrics like consumer sentiment, unemployment, and gross domestic product as indicators of a healthy or potentially sick economy. Economists like to look at bond yields, “beige book” data from the Federal Reserve, commodity prices, manufacturing activity, shipping indexes and other esoteric measurements to gauge where an economy is heading. But none of these are reliable predictors either. They oftentimes contradict each other or fail to reveal underlying problems (a housing collapse? junk bonds? tulips?) that are the trigger for a recession.The truth is that no one really knows. Economists and academics and pundits have been historically wrong too many times. Some like to manufacture needless panic so that they can get a spot on CNBC. Will it be tariffs this time? Higher inflation? An AI bubble? Your guess – their guess – is as good as any.Also, I don’t like to rely too heavily on government data – it’s based on surveys and initial releases are oftentimessignificantly revisedwell after the fact. I’m also not a big fan of data from trade associations. They also gather their numbers through polling and tend to skew towards a rosier view of how their industry is doing. Small business surveys are the worst – I get a dozen a month, all from organizations with their own agendas (“98% of small businesses say AI is critical for them,” reports a tech company that’s introducing new AI features in its product; “80% of business owners support President Trump’s policies,” says a right-leaning commerce association). These aren’t actual reports. But they’re not far off.Is a recession coming? Here’s my advice: go to the source.An economy is run on three key components: consumers, capital and labor. And although no one can predict the future, the best place to get a handle on where things are going is to look at actual data from the companies that are driving these three components: retailers, banks and payroll companies.For example, for the most recent quarterWalmartreported “solid momentum”,Amazonhad a 10% net increase in sales andHome Depot’sCEO said: “Our fourth quarter results exceeded our expectations.” So far, so good. But I’ll be looking closely at the next round of earnings releases in May.What about banks? On 15 April,Citibanksaid it has a “strong quarter”,JPMorgansaid its quarter also showed “strong underlying business and financial results” and that its “fortress balance sheet enables the firm to be a pillar of strength, particularly during volatile or challenging times”. Jon Snow would love that.Wells Fargosaid it had “solid results”. Capital seems OK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

John Gibson, the CEO of Paychex, said this month, as part of the company’s release of itsSmall Business Employment Watch, that “according to our most recent data, the small business labor market is fundamentally healthy and showing no current signs of a recession”. Nela Richardson, the chief economist atADP, said that “despite policy uncertainty and downbeat consumers, the bottom line is this: the March topline number was a good one for the economy and employers of all sizes, if not necessarily all sectors”.These are not surveys, polls or extrapolations. It’s actual data that these companies are using to run their businesses and report to their shareholders. Their CEOs are held back via SEC rules from making forward-looking statements. But you can read the tea leaves. If there are cracks forming, you’ll know it here. And if you’re getting this data as soon as it’s released – which is also not hard to find – you’ll be on top of how the economy is doing and where it’s going.Quoting those funny metrics or raising concerns over the latest government data may be a good way to start a conversation. But it’s not a great way to predict a recession.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessUS economyEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

Verstappen was adjudged to have been at fault and given a five-second penalty but he maintained his place at the front in clean air.The Dutchman pushed hard but could not open a wide enough lead to cover the penalty and Piastri held his nerve and his cool to ease ahead through the pit stops, after which his pace and superior tyre wear paid off and he exercised iron control to take the flag by 2.8sec.Charles Leclerc took Ferrari’s first podium in third, Lando Norris was fourth for McLaren in a strong comeback drive from 10th on the grid, and George Russell was fifth for Mercedes. Lewis Hamilton could not match his Ferrari teammate, taking seventh.For Piastri then, his third win this year was another strong statement of intent after dominant wins in Bahrain and China. Based on his performance on the high-speed challenge of the Jeddah Corniche Circuit which demands commitment for a quick lap, his confidence and equanimity in how the McLaren handles under him was once more clear and sits in stark contrast with his teammate Norris, who was considered the championship favourite.Piastri wielded it in Jeddah with the same controlled aplomb as he has all season and it is paying off. He now leads the world championship for the first time in his short career, 10 points ahead of Norris with Verstappen in third, 12 points back.F1 driver standingsVerstappen and Red Bull, however, will still consider this a strong result. In Bahrain Verstappen could manage only sixth place, his car a recalcitrant beast, lacking in almost every area and left floundering against the dominant McLaren and indeed Mercedes and Ferrari. He was wrestling with it through waves of frustration and ire, made clear to his team in no uncertain terms.Yet the Red Bull was quick and handling well in Jeddah, another indication of how on any given weekend it can veer from fearsome to frightful, according to whether it finds an increasingly narrow operating window but this was nonetheless a strong performance from driver and team.He and Red Bull were aggrieved at the penalty but might consider the better option would have been to have Verstappen hand the place back immediately rather than risk censure, although regardless he did not look to have the pace to deny Piastri across the race.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This was better than he expected, having warned that he believed fifth or sixth might be the best he could manage.On a counterstrategy of opening on the hard tyres Norris once again demonstrated he is far more comfortable with the McLaren in race pace rather in the very edge over a single lap in qualifying.He chastised himself for his crash on Saturday and is more than well aware that given his issues with the car he can ill afford to make unforced errors. Norris is very self-critical as a driver and lacking confidence in the car will not be helping him so this decent run in Jeddah will help, but the British driver very much needs some clean and preferably victorious races to reassert himself.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Piastri, however, in Jeddah as he has repeatedly this season, made the task look seamless even while navigating the unforgiving circuit which punishes errors with finality.

A notable omission: Washington’s Alex Sarr, who averaged 13 points this season.Last year: Wembanyama won, with Oklahoma City’s Chet Holmgren and Charlotte’s Brandon Miller the other finalists.Sixth man of the yearFinalists: Malik Beasley, Detroit; Ty Jerome, Cleveland; Payton Pritchard, Boston.Pritchard is the overwhelming favorite, though voters clearly took note of what Beasley did off the Pistons’ bench – making more than 300 3-pointers – and Jerome was particularly steady for the Cavs all season.Last year: Minnesota’s Naz Reid won, with Sacramento’s Malik Monk and Milwaukee’s Bobby Portis the other finalists.Does Tom Thibodeau really run his players into the ground?

Daniels and Zubac both had exceptionally good seasons, particularly on the defensive end.Last year: Philadelphia’s Tyrese Maxey won, with Houston’s Alperen Sengun and Chicago’s Coby White the other finalists.Defensive player of the yearFinalists: Dyson Daniels, Atlanta; Draymond Green, Golden State; Evan Mobley, Cleveland.Daniels was a steals machine, Mobley has the gift of being able to defend the rim with physicality but not foul, and Green is seeking his second award after winning it in 2016-17.Minnesota’s Rudy Gobert remains on four DPOY awards, tied with Basketball Hall of Fame inductees Dikembe Mutombo and Ben Wallace as winners of the most. Wembanyama – who won the blocked-shots title this season – probably would have won this award in a runaway had he not been sidelined since the All-Star break with deep vein thrombosis in one of his shoulders.Last year: Gobert won, with Miami’s Bam Adebayo and Wembanyama the other finalists.Clutch player of the yearFinalists: Jalen Brunson, New York; Anthony Edwards, Minnesota; Nikola Jokic, Denver.Can’t go wrong here.

They will be – of that there is only mathematical but virtually no practical doubt. For now, though, the title remains unclaimed for a little while longer.Similarly, Ipswich are not yet relegated, but – as acknowledged by Kieran McKenna even before this defeat – their football will be played in the Championship next season. An implausible five wins to see out the season would likely still send them down on goal difference. If this match marked the reading of their last rites in the top flight, they appeared to hear them in a stupor.By the time Davis was shown a straight red card for a tackle that possessed an abundant capacity to injure but no hope of winning the ball, his side were two goals down and staring at a task that appeared near impossible. His dismissal, with almost an hour remaining, confirmed as much.Saka continued after receiving treatment, but an ice pack was strapped to his ankle upon his substitution in the second half. Arteta played down any lasting damage: “He was a bit sore, but it’s nothing serious, so it’s good. He cuts him from the back. I don’t think it’s intentional at all, but it’s dangerous because he cannot really react to anything, because you cannot see him coming.”The match ceased to exist as anything even resembling a contest following Davis’s departure, although Arsenal’s dominance had been abundantly clear from kick-off, jogging and sometimes walking their way into a healthy lead.Both early goals followed a similar script, emerging from a right side where Ben White, Martin Ødegaard and Saka started together for the first time since November.Saka, in particular, caused all manner of problems. His first cutback went via Ødegaard’s toe to Leandro Trossard who, loitering near the penalty spot, prodded past Alex Palmer while falling backwards. When Saka repeated the trick soon after, Mikel Merino’s backheel sent the ball towards Gabriel Martinelli who was able to tap into an empty net at the far post.View image in fullscreenArsenal’s Gabriel Martinelli scores their second goal after a clever backheel by Mikel Merino.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersThat Saka was credited with neither assist did nothing to deny his role as creator of both. The England forward instantly became the home fans’ primary target following Davis’s sending off, although they would have been hard pressed to challenge the decision with the benefit of replays. They did, at least, gain a modicum of perverse pleasure from his inability to add his name to the scoresheet despite multiple efforts.“I probably thought at the start it was the highest standard we’d faced this year,” McKenna said of Arsenal’s first-half performance. “The red card makes it an impossible task in terms of getting back into the game.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Aside from a couple of early skirmishes, where he stood up resolutely to the tricky figure of Julio Enciso, Rice may as well have not been there for all that he was troubled.The absence of any jeopardy allowed Arteta to rotate his troops after the break, with Saka, Merino, Rice and Martinelli all able to put their feet up early.From the ninth minute to the 56th, Ipswich did not even muster a shot, McKenna forced to revert to a 5-3-1 formation in the second half in a bid to prevent the floodgates from opening. It had some success, although Arsenal – exhibiting their set-piece prowess – added two more from short corners.First, Trossard strolled unaccompanied to the edge of the six-yard box before swivelling on the ball and drilling low past Palmer. Then, Ethan Nwaneri cut inside and his shot took multiple deflections on its way into the net. It was nothing that their dominance did not deserve, and Arteta’s side is now unbeaten in 11 matches across all competitions.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“We are really happy; really happy with the performance,” Arteta said. “I think the first 35 minutes is one of the best we played this season.”Ipswich fans have now endured seven successive home defeats, the club’s longest losing run at Portman Road.

The Bruins, led by Olympic champion Jordan Chiles, placed second with 197.6125. Missouri (197.2500) finished third in its first appearance in the final, while Utah (197.2375) was fourth.The championship was Oklahoma’s third in the last four seasons and its 11th appearance in the final round over the last 13 years.Oklahoma and UCLA were tied after the opening rotation, with the Sooners posting a 49.615 on beam – their strongest event – and the Bruins matching that total on floor.

The Utes, who have won nine national championships – the most in NCAA history – have not claimed the title since 1995.UCLA, in their first year as a Big Ten program, came within four tenths of their first championship in seven years. The Bruins finished strong with 9.9250 and 9.9375 on beam from seniors Emily Lee and Emma Malabuyo, but couldn’t close the gap.“It stings,” said UCLA coach Janelle McDonald. “But this group brought us back to the top of the sport, and they’ve laid a foundation for what’s next.”Michigan reclaimed NCAA men’s gymnastics supremacy, capturing their first national title since 2014 by edging five-time defending champion Stanford in a dramatic finish. The Wolverines totaled 422.224 points – just ahead of Stanford’s 422.196 – with Olympic bronze medalists Fred Richard and Paul Juda going 1-2 in the all-around to lead the charge.Juda clinched the victory with a 13.966 on vault, capping a day that also saw him win the parallel bars title with a 14.200. Michigan, who finished second to Stanford in 2024 by more than five points, flipped the script at home to earn the program’s seventh national championship. Oklahoma (417.891) rounded out the podium, followed by Nebraska, Penn State and Illinois.In individual events, Stanford’s Asher Hong repeated as rings champion and added a floor title, while standout performances from Air Force’s Patrick Hoopes (pommel horse), Ohio State’s Kameron Nelson (vault), and Oklahoma’s Emre Dodanli (high bar) showcased the sport’s growing depth across programs.Explore more on these topicsGymnasticsCollege sportsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

As a team we made too many mistakes tonight to have a better result. The version we showed tonight was not good enough.“When you play Barcelona, you just need to be brave on the ball, being able to hold the ball under pressure, and being able also in the physical aspects to win your duels, and just sometimes in your football brain to be smarter, to anticipate things. I think we played with too many reactions, instead of being proactive in the game.”Chelsea are trying to reach the European final for only the second time and could still win a quadruple of major trophies this term in Bompastor’s first season in charge, but they will now need an unlikely looking comeback and the performance of their lives if they are to have any chance of overturning this deficit in London.The scoreline could have been worse for Chelsea but for Hannah Hampton’s early penalty save, at a time when the tie was level at 0-0, when the former Ballon d’Or winner Alexia Putellas was denied from the spot. That kept the home side at bay but not for long, with Putellas classily slipping a through ball into the path of Ewa Pajor for the Poland striker to open the scoring.Chelsea improved defensively after the break but were undone by a masterful team goal as Barcelona made it 2-0 with a move that involved 18 passes before Clàudia Pina turned in from inside the six-yard box. Pina herself had played the 13th pass of Barcelona’s flowing move from deep inside her own half before sprinting upfield to turn home the cross.View image in fullscreenChelsea’s Keira Walsh and Sjoeke Nüsken show their disappointment after Barcelona’s fourth goal.Photograph: Albert Gea/ReutersSandy Baltimore’s crisp strike into the far corner with 16 minutes remaining offered Bompastor’s team a glimmer of hope to bring the scoreline back to 2-1, but a far-post header from an unmarked Irene Paredes restored Barcelona’s two-goal advantage soon after. Pina then struck again from close range in the 90th minute to severely hamper Chelsea’s hopes for the second leg, and make the hosts’ advantage on the scoreboard more accurately reflect their dominance.Quick GuideWSL roundup: Holmgaards combine to hit City's Champions League hopesShowManchester City's fading hopes of qualifying for the Women's Champions League were further dented as they dropped points at home in a 1-1 draw withEverton.Nick Cushing's injury-hit side had taken the lead in scrappy fashion when Kerstin Casparij reacted fastest to a bouncing ball in the box to tuck in from close range, but that early goal was cancelled out when Karen Holmgaard (right of picture) headed in a cross by her twin sister Sara (left of picture) to equalise. The result left fourth-placed Manchester City seven points away from a European place with only three games remaining.Second-bottomAston Villatook a giant step towards survival as Kirsty Hanson's 91st-minute winner gave them a 3-2 victory away atTottenham.

Putellas opted to send her strike straight down the middle and the England goalkeeper Hampton, who had dived slightly to Putellas’s right, made the save comfortably with her feet.That proved to be one of the only moments of celebration for the travelling Chelsea fans and ultimately this was a game which highlighted Barcelona’s superior skill as they appear to be on course to knock Chelsea out at the semi-final stage of this competition for the third successive season.Bompastor refused to concede the tie, though, trying to hold on to some hope for a return-leg comeback: “It will be difficult but, in football, you need to believe. We want to go into the second leg trying to win the game and, in football, anything can happen.” The defender Lucy Bronze told TNT Sports: “I think we can do it.”Barcelona are aiming to reach their fifth consecutive final and lift the European title for the fourth time in those five seasons, having started their current run of dominance in this competition with a 4-0 win against Chelsea – who have never won this title – in the 2021 final in Gothenburg, Sweden.This first-leg meeting was similarly one-sided to that showdown four years ago. But Paredes was urging caution when telling the Catalan television channel TV3: “It’s not done.

Into added time at Craven Cottage andChelsea, who had finally thrown off the shackles after equalising through Tyrique George, seemed to have remembered they can play football. Inhibited no more, their quality took over as they moved down the right, Enzo Fernández and Cole Palmer swapping passes before the ball came to Pedro Neto to round things off with a finish that left no room for any debate.These are the moments that turn seasons, perhaps even save jobs. For long spells this was the same old story from Chelsea. Creating little, they trailed 1-0 early on and no doubt would have faced a torrent of abuse from the away end hadFulhamclung on to their slender advantage.Alexander-Arnold winner puts Liverpool on verge of title and relegates LeicesterRead moreYet credit goes to Enzo Maresca for making the tweaks that altered the flow of this west London derby, pushing Fulham back and providing Chelsea with the foundations to stage a comeback that could prove vital in their push for Champions League qualification.Maresca, who is not exactly popular with supporters at the moment, earned his moment of catharsis. He took decisive action at half‑time, Jadon Sancho and Malo Gusto impressive after coming on, and was rewarded for trusting his instincts when he modified his attack by replacing his only target man, Nicolas Jackson, with a 19-year-old winger with 12 minutes left.At that stage Maresca’s prediction that Chelsea would have no chance of finishing in the top five unless Jackson and Palmer rediscover their poise in front of goal looked spot on. Yet whatever George lacks in size and experience is more than made up for by his willing and speed around the box. The academy product soon grabbed his first goal at this level, finishing with authority, and Maresca’s desire for others to accept responsibility when Palmer and Jackson misfire was answered by Neto’s rocket.The head coach, who was booked for his celebrations after the second goal, smiled and expressed relief at unlikely inspiration not coming from Marc Cucurella for once. “A must‑win game,” said Maresca, who added that Christopher Nkunku was left out of the squad for technical reasons. “It is a nice feeling to win at the end. It was a good for the players. They deserved to celebrate with the fans.”Chelsea had plenty to prove after underwhelming home performancesagainst IpswichandLegia Warsaw. Earning their first away win in the league since December required them to pass a test of character and physicality in the end. Fulham, on the other hand, seemed to lose their nerve as they closed in on their first double over Chelsea. Marco Silva admitted that his side dropped too deep during the second half, leaving them unable to hold on to a win that would have strengthened their European qualification push.The early signs were unpromising for the visitors. Fulham were quick and purposeful, whereas Chelsea were skittish and slow out of the traps. Various duels unfolded and many were dominated by someone in white, whether it was Raúl Jiménez unsettling Maresca’s centre-backs or Sander Berge and Sasa Lukic going toe to toe with Fernández and Caicedo. Ryan Sessegnon constantly ran at Cucurella on the right.View image in fullscreenTyrique George fires in Chelsea’s equaliser.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersChelsea responded with some vague attacking patterns, many of them designed around attempting to isolate Neto against Kenny Tete on the left. Incision was lacking. Only Neto looked dangerous, fizzing in one cross that just evaded Jackson.Fulham led after 20 minutes, pouncing when Reece James took too long to release the ball after striding out of defence. Sessegnon hustled Chelsea’s captain and found Alex Iwobi, who had time to set himself and drill a low shot past Robert Sánchez.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We created a lot of chances, we controlled the game, and one set piece changes the game and that’s it – really frustrating to end the game like this.”Amorim’s team have scored only 38 times – one for each of their points. Referencing not scoring shines a light on his critically misfiring No 9, Rasmus Højlund, who has only one goal in 29 hours and 28 minutes –against Leicesterbefore the last international break.Asked if it might be time to give the Dane a break from the fray, Amorim said: “If you look at games, we have several players that missed big chances, not just Rasmus. But for Rasmus, the game is to score goals because he is a striker. But it is a team thing. I have already said that.“Our team should score more goals, it is not just Rasmus missing chances, it is all the team. The only way I know is to work on him, show him the videos. He needed to score a goal, he will not score if he’s out. So I try to manage that during games. But he needs to score one, maybe that’s all a striker needs.”United aretargeting Ipswich’s Liam Delapas a potential centre-forward recruit in the summer. Amorim was asked if a reliable scorer is required. “Of course we have an idea of what this team needs,” he said. “But all the team needs to score more goals. We need to improve as a team because if you don’t score goals in this league it’s impossible to win.”Amorim is correct to point the finger at his whole attack. Towards the end, Mason Mount twice spurned close-range openings to grab at least a share of the points: first he scooped over wildly; then after Eriksen’s outside-of-the-right-foot delivery, he spooned a volley wide.View image in fullscreenBruno Fernandes looks dejected after Manchester United concede.Photograph: Scott Heppell/ReutersThis late phase of the contest was, at last, a little watchable. While no one could expect a repeat of the operatic extra-timewin against Lyonon Thursday, nor would you dream this battle of 14th versus 17th to be so soporific.When Højlund collected the ball by the touchline near Amorim’s technical area, left Emmanuel Agbadou trailing and galloped into yards of grass, the game had a first moment of skill and verve – 50 minutes in. The No 9, starved of service all term as his manager says, looked up, saw teammates arriving on the far side, ignored them, dawdled, and Wolves escaped.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On came Mount, Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot and United continued to be the brighter side, keeping and flicking the ball about inside Wolves’ territory.A slick move had Eriksen passing the ball to Alejandro Garnacho who sprinted down the left-sided channel and crossed: Højlund was inches away from stabbing home but the ball slid past.

Obviously, I was a bit surprised but I just have to accept it. Honestly, I still think I can perform at this level like I’m showing but I understand clubs have to make decisions.”The champions are down in fourth place and De Bruyne believes he may have been offered new terms if the title defence had been more robust. “Maybe if the team didn’t struggle and I came back like I did this year [after injury] and bedded in like normal then maybe they would take another decision.“I still have a lot to give.

Simple and clear messages make working for and with theNottingham Foresthead coach uncomplicated, because everybody knows what is demanded of them on and off the pitch.The only place Nuno’s methods have not worked at is Tottenham, where he returns on Monday with Forest, who are in a race to qualify for the Champions League and are preparing for an FA Cup semi-final. The Portuguese wasnever the right fit in north London, lasting four months before being dismissed, but he will not be out for revenge: the league table has done that for him.‘It’s a new world’: the analysts using AI to psychologically profile elite playersRead moreNuno’s work at Rio Ave, Valencia, Porto and Wolves earned him a shot at a bigPremier Leagueclub and despite failing at Spurs he and his close-knit staff have recovered from the disappointment to take one of the Premier League’s unfancied clubs close to European qualification.Along the way, he has learned to balance the aspects of his character that make him an inspirational leader: he is meticulous, cool under pressure but capable of outbursts of emotion, backed by self-belief. It all comes back to a love of winning and a hatred of losing. From the start he embraced being the underdog, taking Rio Ave – from Vila do Conde, half an hour north of Porto – into Europe for the first time.“He was confident and very ambitious,” the former Rio Ave striker Ahmed Hassan says. “Everybody felt his vibe, his energy. He has a very good way to motivate players and this was one of his best attributes. He has a clear philosophy and is very hard-working and expects the same from players. I really loved his speeches before games. He tries to touch you and make you feel very motivated. Then you want to play so badly because after his speech you feel goose bumps.”View image in fullscreenNuno Espírito Santo celebrates with his players after their FA Cup quarter-final victory over Brighton. Next Sunday they face Manchester City at Wembley.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersIt can seem as if there is a constant intensity to Nuno. To relax he plays the handpan, a calming musical instrument often used during meditation, and has been known to show off his talents to colleagues, inspiring one to buy the instrument. He owns two horses and is a keen equestrian, using time off to ride them over jumps.There has always been an admiration for British football. Despite not playing in the country, Nuno took his coaching badges in Scotland and always envisaged managing in England. That came to pass with Wolves in 2017, a wheel greased by his long-term adviser, Jorge Mendes.Since the early days, he has been defensively minded and played on the counterattack, reliant on the quality of Diogo Jota, Hélder Costa and Rúben Neves to settle matches at Wolves. Not much has changed, but now it is Anthony Elanga, Morgan Gibbs-White and Callum Hudson-Odoidoing the damage for Forest. When Wolves won the Championship in 2018, 14 matches were settled by a one-goal margin. Rampant victories have rarely been Nuno’s style.View image in fullscreenNuno Espírito Santo had an ill-fated spell as manager of Tottenham. He returns to his former club with Forest challenging for a Champions League berth.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianNuno wants his players to work for one another. Talent is integral, but character is almost as important. “The whole atmosphere around the club was absolutely incredible,” says the former Wolves defender Ryan Bennett. “Every single day, the rule was you see the manager, you shake his hand, you see the staff, you shake their hand. The little things they did made the general atmosphere.”Everyone would eat together at the Sir Jack Hayward training ground. Staff would sit at one long table and the players another. It was the job of the club captain, Conor Coady, to ask permission for players to get their food and no one would leave before the last person had finished their meal. The conversations held in the canteen built camaraderie and long‑lasting friendships.When a player arrives, especially from abroad, Nuno makes extra effort to ensure things are settled off the pitch so they can perform on it, something Hassan benefited from. Being multilingual helps him speak to his global contingent. Fluent in Portuguese, Spanish and English, he even conversed at Wolves with the defender Maximilian Kilman in Russian, a language Nuno learned during a season as a Dynamo Moscow player.View image in fullscreenWolves celebrate a goal scored by Ryan Bennett on their way to promotion from the Championship under Nuno in 2018.Photograph: Alan Walter/Action Images/ReutersIt may not always be verbalised, but Nuno wants to win a trophy wherever he may be. “His demeanour was very serious all the time,” says Bennett. “He always looked like he was thinking and always, always very serious.”If a team do not have ambitions to challenge for silverware, Nuno would not entertain the prospect of coaching them. Even when he joined Forest in a relegation battle, he was thinking of triumph. Two FA Cup wins at Wembley, the first against Manchester City next Sunday, would achieve this.Nuno’s trusted fitness coach, António Dias, worked hard over pre-season, focusing on the players running for long periods to ensure everyone could cope with Nuno’s demands, and is adept at managing loads.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We were doing things I’d never seen before; we were wearing light therapy glasses in the morning to try to keep our body clocks on at the same time when in Europe.”Some players regard Nuno as distant, but those are the ones he feels he does not need to hover over. They can look after themselves and know how to maintain the rules, whereas the younger ones may require cajoling into line. Professionalism is demanded by the whole staff, as Hassan recalls from a misstep with Dias.View image in fullscreenA large tifo banner of the Forest manager.Photograph: Matt West/Shutterstock“He’s a fantastic fitness coach and he told me he needs to do some extra work with me one afternoon by myself. I arrived late because I went to the barber and left late and I remember so much that he was really pissed off with me.“It never happened again. It was the first and last time because he’s very sharp with everything when it comes to professionalism. He likes the players to be very professional and he always tells us that this is for us for our sake.”There is often an underlying closeness between Nuno and his players. He can randomly produce a bear hug to instigate a laugh and chat or, as Ola Aina can testify,offer a piggybackto those without the energy to walk off the pitch after a gruelling match.He really tries to touch you and make you feel very motivatedAhmed HassanNuno works on an understanding of mutual respect, with everyone working towards a common goal, whether it is avoiding relegation or winning the league and he will not rest even when the job is ostensibly done. Wolves were promoted in 2018 with four games remaining after Fulham failed to beat Brentford thanks to a stoppage‑time Neal Maupay equaliser.“We were watching the game, a goal went in very, very late,” says Bennett. “There was a massive cheer and obviously the English boys were a bit different and we wanted to celebrate. Five minutes after that, it was: ‘Right, we’ve got a game tomorrow, let’s go to bed, we need to prepare.’“We came down, a totally normal morning, a normal game and we’re thinking: ‘We’re not even enjoying this.’ We won the game. Again, it was just coming to the training on Monday. It was still the same process: ‘We’ve got games to win. We want to get as many points as we can.’ It was just constant and consistent. That’s what kept us and made us what we were.”It is all very serious to Nuno, but it will be worth it should Forest – fourth in the table before the weekend’s fixtures – secure Champions League football because he will know he did it his way and that has never changed. Then he may allow a few beers and an audience with the handpan.Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestThe ObserverPremier LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was fined by the FIA for swearing in a press conference at the Singapore GP last year and this season has been far more guarded and short in answering questions. Speaking to the media in Jeddah he suggested he felt constrained by the rulebook.Oscar Piastri storms to Saudi Arabian F1 GP win and now leads title raceRead more“The problem is I cannot share my opinion about it because I might get penalised so it’s better not to talk about,” he said. “Anything I say or try to say about it might get me in trouble.”The inference that was impossible to ignore is that any negative remarks about the FIA or its stewards’ decisions may prompt punishment.“I know I cannot swear in here but at the same time you also cannot be critical in any form that might harm or danger,” he said. “Then you get the sheet out, there is a lot of lines. That’s why it is better not to talk about it because you can put yourself in trouble and I don’t think anyone wants that.”Verstappen added that another concern “has to do with social media and the way the world is”.“I’d prefer not to talk – sometimes your words can be twisted or interpreted in a different way,” he said. “You can’t share your opinions because it’s not appreciated as it used to be. People can’t handle the truth.”McLaren’s Oscar Piastri won the race from second on the grid, beating Verstappen by 2.8sec but the decisive moment as far asRed Bulland the world champion were concerned had come within seconds of the lights going out.Verstappen had started from pole on the short run to the first corner but Piastri made a very quick start and had eased just in front as they went through turn one. Piastri held his line and Verstappen went wide, cutting the corner at turn to maintain his lead.The world champion believed he had not been given enough room, while Piastri felt that Verstappen had not even tried to make the corner. Red Bull opted not to give the place back and the stewards investigated awarded Verstappen a five-second penalty.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Williams said his eyes had “completely gone” after defeat by Ding Junhui in the Players’ Championship in March, and he is understood to be considering surgery.The 21-year-old Wu, one of the audacious stars of China’s latest generation of cueists, had gripped on to Williams’ coattails after resuming 5-4 behind on Sunday, and when the younger man nudged in front in the 15th frame the momentum appeared to have shifted in his favour. Instead a lapse in concentration in the 16th frame cost him dear, Williams using all his guile to pull level before brilliantly crafted breaks of 58 and 75 got him over the line.“Some of the balls he can pot is incredible and he’s got the ability to win this tournament, no question,” Williams said of Wu afterwards. “But I got stronger towards the end and if I can’t outscore or outpot him, I suppose I can outwit him.”Chris Wakelin withstood a stirring comeback from Neil Robertson to beat the Australian former champion 10-8 and seal his place in the second round for the first time. The 33-year-old from Rugby, who had not won a match at the famous venue in three previous attempts, resumed with a 7-2 lead but was rooted in his seat as Robertson reeled off five frames on the bounce to haul the match back level.However, Wakelin recovered his form at the right time, twice poking his nose back in front before riding his luck to clinch a dramatic 18th frame and finally confirm his place in the last 16.Also in a drama-filled evening session, 11th seed Barry Hawkins surrendered a slender overnight advantage to Iranian qualifier Hossein Vafaei, whose pressure-filled break of 73 in the decider sealed a 10-9 win and a second round meeting with Williams.View image in fullscreenXiao Guodong completed a 10-4 victory over qualifier Matthew Selt on Sunday.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PAMark Allen dug deep to chisel out a 5-4 overnight advantage against China’s world No 46 Fan Zhengyi.

The Gallagher brothers may be taking over the world’s stadiums this summer, but over onTikTokusers are moving to a different beat.Views of posts using electronic music as a soundtrack, including techno and house, outgrew those tagged for indie and alternative for the first time in 2024, according to the social media app.There were more than 13bn views of videos tagged #ElectronicMusic worldwide last year, an increase of 45% on 2023, representing faster growth than the “indie and alternative” and “rap and hip-hop” genres. Videos created with the electronic music tag grew by more than 100% over the same period.TikTok said creators were turning to electronic music in particular as a soundtrack for specific types of video clips, such as sport, fitness and fashion. It has also proved popular with travel content and summer holiday recaps.TikTok’s head of music partnerships for the UK and Ireland, Toyin Mustapha, said the success of British artists such as Disclosure and Joel Corry had underlined electronic music’s entry into the mainstream.“Dance music has become more accessible and big in the commercial sphere,” he said. “We are seeing the breaking down of boundaries for artists, and TikTok is part of that.”TikTok, which has more than 1 billion users worldwide, has become a major platform for breaking and supporting music artists. One of the biggest summer anthems of last year, Adam Port’s Move, established its appeal on the app before becoming a streaming hit. It reached the top 10 in the UK and across Europe. Another hit on TikTok and streaming platforms last year was Pawsa’s Dirty Cash (Money Talks), which reached No 17 in the UK charts.Fred Again’s headlining sets at the Reading and Leeds festivals have underlined the ascent of electronic artists in major markets, but Mustapha also points to mainstream chart success. Jazzy become the first female Irish act to reach No 1 in Ireland in more than a decade in 2023.“It’s not just reflected in festival bookings, you can see it in the official charts as well,” he said.Two British DJs have also taken off on TikTok in recent years. Hannah Laing, aformer dental nurse from Dundeeknown as the queen of “doof”, has launched her own festival and label after building a steady music career on the app.Billy Gillies, a Belfast DJ whose hits include DNA (Loving You) has also built a strong following on the platform.UK views of videos with the #ElectronicMusic hashtag grew 22%, while the number of videos created with the same hashtag rose by more than 50%.“TikTok users tend to tag the genres of music, especially genres like electronic music. It shows the community they are trying to build and are part of, and electronic music is very much a community-led thing,” Mustapha said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last year, TikTok flagged a trend called “Britishcore”, which celebrated the more mundane aspects of UK life but also captured excitement over the Gallagher brothers’ reunion. The hashtag #OasisReunion received more than 100m video views in thefortnight after their comeback tour was announced.As well as a boom in electronic music, British TikTok users alsoembraced the music industry’s back cataloguelast year. TikTokers set a new high for use of old tracks on British posts, with tunes more than five years old accounting for 19 out of the 50 top tracks in 2024. Popular back catalogue tunes included Sade’s Kiss of Life and Sophie Ellis-Bextor’s Murder on the Dancefloor.As with electronic music, the trend was also global. Twenty of the top 50 tracks worldwide came from back catalogues, led by the 1980s hit Forever Young by the German synth-pop band Alphaville.Explore more on these topicsTikTokElectronic musicIndienewsShareReuse this content"

Every parent has been in that position. A few more minutes in front of the television to keep them out from under your feet … A new smartphone, ignoring the nagging voice in your head that questions it, because ‘all my friends have one’, despite knowing how much time you spend on your own smartphone.“You are not supposed to be your child’s friend. Sometimes being the parent means making difficult decisions in your child’s long-term interests, no matter how loudly they disagree.“They need you to give them love, understanding, support and boundaries. It means listening to your child, always encouraging the height of their aspirations, but not just doing exactly what they want.”Nearly a quarter of children spend more than four hours a day on an internet-enabled device, a survey for the children’s commissioner suggested earlier this month.A YouGov poll of 502 children in England aged eight to 15 found that 23% spent more than four hours a day using an internet-enabled device with a screen, such as a computer, phone, tablet or gaming console.One in four (25%) spent two to three hours a day on such a device, while a fifth (20%) spent three to four hours a day, according to the survey, which was carried out in March and April.De Souza added that parents needed to “feel confident having challenging conversations with their children about the things they see online”.“We need parents to give their children the opportunities to talk about violent or sexual content they see online without simply having their device confiscated, because it will find them elsewhere,” she said. “As adults we are ourselves dopamine-addicted, stuck in a cycle of scrolling yet we still have no idea of what our children are seeing.”The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, is looking at the effects of smartphone bans in some schools in England, a policy idea supported by the National Education Union amid growing concerns of the impact of social media on children.The current non-statutory guidance states that schools should prohibit the use of mobile phones throughout the school day during lessons as well as break and lunchtimes, but does not say how schools should enforce the bans.De Souza’s survey of 15,000 state schools in England found that 99.8% of primaries and 90% of secondaries limited the use of mobiles during the day, including banning phones on school grounds, requiring children to hand in phones or leave them in a secure place that they cannot access in the day, or requiring them to be kept out of sight.De Souza, a former headteacher, has previously said banning mobile phones should be a school leader’s choice rather than imposed nationally by the government.She wrote in the Sunday Times that she believed “schools are only part of the solution”.“Head teachers have told me that despite their own policies they remain deeply concerned about children’s safety online, because most of the time children spend on their phones is outside school hours when they are in their parents’ care,” she said.Last month, the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, questioned why the government had opposed a Tory amendment to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill to require schools to ban the use of phones.Keir Starmer, the prime minister, described the proposal as “completely unnecessary” as he claimed that “almost every school” already banned phones.Explore more on these topicsSmartphonesChildrenSchoolsParents and parentingnewsShareReuse this content"

They are typically hired to work remotely, enabling them to escape detection and send their wagesto Kim Jong-un’s state.Google said in a report this month that a case uncovered last year involved a single North Korean worker deploying at least 12 personae across Europe and the US. The IT worker was seeking jobs within the defence industry and government sectors. Under a new tactic, the bogus IT professionals have been threatening to release sensitive company data after being fired.John Hultquist, the chief analyst at Google’s Threat Intelligence group, told the Guardian that North Korea had turned to Europe, and the UK in particular, after it became more difficult to implement its fake worker ploy in the US.He said: “North Korea is facing pressure in the US and it is particularly focused on the UK for extending its IT worker tactic. It is in the UK where you can see the most extensive operations in Europe.”The fake IT worker scam typically works with the help of “facilitators”, or people with a physical presence in the country where the company inadvertently employing the North Korean agents is based.These facilitators carry out important assisting work such as providing false passports and maintaining a physical address in the country, where laptops are sent to the IT employee when they are hired.This laptop is then made accessible to a person working for Pyongyang, who typically does not reside in the same country as the facilitator. However, the fake workers are also known to be taking advantage of companies offering “bring your own device” employment, in which the devices are less easily monitored.“The bottom line is their operations have a physical presence in the UK, which is the most important step to grow across multiple sectors in the country,” said Hultquist.Hultquist said carrying out job interviews in person or on video would disrupt North Korean tactics.“Many of the remedies are in the hands of the HR department, which usually has very little experience dealing with a covert state adversary,” he said. “If you want to you’ve got to use background checks, do a better job checking physical identities, and ensuring the person you’re talking to is who they claim to be. This scheme usually breaks down when the actor is asked to go on camera or come into the office for an interview.”Sarah Kern, a North Korea specialist at the cybersecurity firm Secureworks, said the threat was “more widespread than companies realise”.She added that British firms could fight the threat by verifying candidates thoroughly and educating their HR departments about the ploy. They should then conduct in-person or video interviews to check that the prospective employee they are considering hiring tallies with who is on their CV.“In the US it has also been fruitful to conduct in-person interviews, or at the very least video interviews, and checking that you’re talking to who was actually advertised on the résumé,” she said.Kern said telltale signs that an IT worker may not be who they claim to be include frequent changes in address and where they want their wages sent – such as money exchange services rather than a conventional bank account.The bogus IT professionals are being recruited in Europe recruited through online platforms including Upwork, Freelancer and Telegram. Upwork said any attempt to use a false identity was a “strict violation of our terms of use” and the company takes “aggressive action to … remove bad actors from our platform”.Kern added:“We observed that they were very avoidant of video interviews because often they’re located in a working centre where there’s a lot of these North Korean IT workers working from one small room.“They wouldn’t want to show their video, or it sounded like they’re in a call centre, but with no actual reason as to why.”Explore more on these topicsTechnologyThe Society interviewCybercrimeNorth KoreaScamsInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

To do so again after being mauled by the lion? It’s what … ill-advised? Reckless? Suicidal? Six years ago I gave a talk atTed, the world’s leading technology and ideas conference. It led to a gruelling lawsuit and a series of consequences that reverberate through my life to this day.And last week I returned. To giveanothertalk that would incorporate some of my experience: a Ted Talk about being sued for giving a Ted Talk, and how the lessons I’d learned from surviving all that were a model for surviving “broligarchy” – a conceptI first wrote aboutin theObserverin July last year: the alignment of Silicon Valley and autocracy, and a kind of power the world has never seen before. The key point I wanted to get across to this powerful and important audience is that politics is technology now. And technology is politics.But as I wrote several drafts in the week leading up to last week’s talk in Vancouver, Canada, I had what felt like a slow-motion anxiety attack. One insistent question throbbed like toothache:why?Why, after everything that had happened last time, was I putting myself through it all over again?In 2019, my first Ted Talk, entitled “Facebook’s role in Brexit – and the threat to democracy”, sent a shock wave across the conference, then the internet and then my life. I ended up facing a defamation suit over 19 words contained in it, that ate up my time, energy and, as time went on, my sanity.And now here we are. In the first weeks of the second Trump presidency, withElon Muskripping up the US government. The power of the tech titans – the subject I’ve been investigating and reporting and talking about for the past nine years – is now finally front and centre. But now it all feels too late. My warning then – that democracy may not survive technology – was not heeded.I’d be speaking, again, directly toSilicon Valley, to the men – because it is men – who are building the latest most powerful technology yet – AI – the runaway train that is coming for all our lives. Men who, crucially, are now marching in step with Donald Trump, the head of what is increasingly looking likea rogue state.And whatcouldI say? How could I address the collapse of the postwar international order and the role that technology is playing in it in the 10 to 12 minutes I’d been allotted? It was absurd. Most Ted Talks are written and learned months in advance, but I was a late addition to the lineup and the day before I was due to depart I didn’t even have a finished script.I could feel a wave of hostility coming from one small section of the audienceThings reached a head on a Zoom meeting with the two lead curators and the head of Ted, a British media entrepreneur and philanthropist, Chris Anderson, who gently tore apart my latest draft, based on a viral column I’d written for theObserver:How to Survive the Broligarchy, 20 lessons for the post-truth world, a cross between a manifesto and a handbook about what techno-authoritarianism is going to mean for us all.Did I really need a slide of Musk doing what looked like a Nazi salute, asked Anderson, given that Musk had denied it and it would alienate part of the audience from the off.Last time around, Anderson pointed out, I’d managed to take the audience with me as I laid out the story.Last time around, I told him, it felt like the situation was redeemable. In 2019, I thought that “the gods of Silicon Valley”, as I’d described them, could be persuaded to take measures to prevent the harms of their platforms. “But that ship has now sailed.” In 2019, people in Silicon Valley could claim ignorance. Now, the leaders of Silicon Valley companies have made a clear and unmistakable choice.Anderson’s counter was that people who work at these companies, and who would be in the room, “are still the best chance of effecting change”. It was actually bracing to hear his pushback, but when he suggested that perhaps I remove a line about the lawsuit I became tearful.The line was about the importance of defending facts, and for me it was what lay at the heart of the entire case. “It’s just really profound for me,” I said. “It’s what it was all about.”“Look,” he said at the end of the call. “We invited you. It’s up to you to choose what you want to say.” The weight, the freedom, theresponsibilityof that lay on me as I fiddled endlessly with my copy on the long flight across the Atlantic.Two days later I stood on the Ted stage and gavethe opening talkof the conference. It began with an unexpected cheer when I put up a slide that read: “It’s a coup”. We can’t fight it if we can’t see it, I said, and we can’t see it if we can’t name it. I wasn’t expecting the spontaneous response. It hadn’t even seemed controversial to me. (All week, in the days after the talk, people told me what a “release” it had been to have someone say the words out loud. “It hit me somewhere beneath my solar plexus,” a fellow speaker said. “I can’t explain how powerful it was to have someone say that, especially here.”)But as I went on, I became aware of another current in the room. I couldfeel a wave of hostility coming from one small section of the audience. I’d had cheers and whoops but I could also see folded arms, hostile stares. Later, I would meet one of them, a close friend of Musk’s whose husband sat on the board of his companies.“In 2019 I called out the gods of Silicon Valley.Sam Altman, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk,” I said in my closing statement. “I was wrong. You are not gods. You are men and you are careless … You are collaborators. You are complicit in a regime of fear and cruelty.”Walking off stage, I gave a loud involuntary sigh that’s audibleon the film of the talk.I tried.I tried in 2019, and I’ve tried again now. It’s my best effort to communicate why we face such profound risk. And that’s the emotion that’s visible, audible, all the way through the talk. It’s why I put myself back out there.Because what happened to me is now coming for so many other people. Not just weaponised lawsuits against other journalists and online campaigns of harassment and abuse – though thatiscoming – but the everyday surveillance and data harvesting to which we are all subjected. In the new political landscapes, that carries new risks. I’ve been on the sharp end of that. I know how itfeels. Terrifying. But it’s also the business model of Silicon Valley, and it’s why, as individuals, we must take steps to protect ourselves.What I can’t stress enough is how much worse the situation is now, six years on.Most of us – and I include myself here – have no idea how fast this technology is accelerating and how much power we are voluntarily giving up, how exposed and vulnerable we are.Watch Carole Cadwalladr’s 2025 Ted Talk, This Is What a Digital Coup Looks Like.I’m now back home. I did a follow-up interview with Anderson in which he called the talk “an absolute blockbuster”. And it now has a life outside the conference; it’s landed onYouTubewhere it’s gainedalmost 1m views in less than a week.American friends and total strangers have sent me heartfelt notes. And two MPs, one Labour, one Conservative, and two members of the House of Lords have sent me messages about a specific reference I made to the UK government’s proposed bill that isseeking to tear upour 300-year-old copyright laws to make it easier for AI companies to use artists’ intellectual property for training their models. It’s called the data use and access bill and it’s currently working its way through the Commons despite protests fromthousandsof people across the entire UK creative industries, including the likes ofElton John and Paul McCartney.But none of that was a given. I almost didn’t go through with it. I’d been unnerved by a back and forth with Tamsin Allen, a UK libel lawyer, hours before my talk. Ultimately, there was risk attached to me saying even the most seemingly innocuously factual things about the case, because it was me, because it was Ted, because the one lesson I’ve learned the hardest way is that when someone wants to attack you, they will find a way.“Watch her talk from five years ago,” reads one of the thousands of comments on YouTube. “She was much more animated, much more upbeat and bright. Now she looks and sounds completely terrified, dejected, exhausted and heartbroken.”AI is in the hands of a small group of reckless, careless men who seem to have no understanding of societyThe internet we’ve created, captured by big corporations and built on data tracking, was not inevitable. Nor is what’s coming next. And it’s why I wanted to write this piece. Because as hopeless as things are, there’s no inevitability to what comes next. It’s why I’m so appalled at the naivety of the British government, which, at the very moment that it should be seeking to strengthen UK national sovereignty against US tech power, is doing the exact opposite. This is not a partisan issue. David Davis, the Conservative MP, leaves me a voice note telling me that he views “the proposed changes in copyright law somewhere between theft and intellectual slavery”. It is, he says, an inversion of property law.The big difference between Ted of six years ago and Ted in 2025 is AI. It dominates almost every conversation. The scale and pace of advancement in the technology is mind-blowing in the true sense of the word. AI’s domination of Ted is just a snapshot of its domination of every coming aspect of our lives.Watch the interview with Sam Altman at Ted.It’s going to blast away whole industries, concentrate even greater power in an even smaller group of men, deplete the planet’s resources even further, and it’s in the hands of reckless, careless people who seem to have no understanding of society. To them, it’s just a race; a winner-takes-all competition. All while the world still looks much the same – same streets, same houses, same politicians talking on the same TVs. It’s why it’s so hard to get your head around it.In my talk I made a point of criticising Sam Altman, another Ted speaker and the chief executive of OpenAI, the company that rocked the world when it unveiled ChatGPT in 2022. And at the end of last week,Anderson interviewed himlive on stage and put my words directly to him: “In our opening session, Carole Cadwalladr showed ChatGPT give a Ted Talk in the style of Carole Cadwalladr and, sure enough, it gave a talk that wasn’t quite as good as the talk she gave, but it was pretty impressive. And she said, ‘OK, it’s great, but I did not consent to this.’”ShouldOpenAIbe using work of people who haven’t consented, he asked. Shouldn’t they be paid?Altman simply avoided the question. “So right now if you use our image generation thing if you say I want something in the style of a living artist, it won’t do that,” he said, referring to the new image generation tool and convenientlyevading the fact that it does exactly that for writers and journalists.Instead, he talked about “the creative spirit of humanity” that AI would now “democratise”. New tools that would allow “new people to make better art, better novels, better content that we all enjoy”.A Canadian editor for the Globe and Mail told me they were now sending reporters to the US with burner phones and wiped laptopsThe point I’d made in my talk is that this entire AI gold rush is theft. So much of the training set for this entire industry is coming from us: our work, our words, our labour. Not just writers, but anyone who’s ever written anything online, as well as photographers, film-makers, musicians. It’s not innovation, it’s theft. But in talk after talk at the conference, this inconvenient truth was glossed over.Afterwards, backstage, I ran into Altman himself. His security guard hovered. “I don’t want to intrude,” I said. “No, I’m happy to answer questions,” he said. But the foundational question of taking other people’s work without permission is something he just can’t answer.“What’s the difference between me reading your work?” he asked. It’s all free to read. What’s the difference? You’re outputting to potentially millions of people for commercial gain for no recompense, I said. It’s fair use, he countered. It’s really not, I said. You’ve ingested the entire body of my work. It’s so easy to establish that.And he was gone. Back to the controls of the tank that is soon to roll over all of us.It wasn’t just the AI dominance that had changed Ted. My talk was the only one that addressed the current political moment, and among the 1,700 people there, it dominated conversation after conversation. A Ted fellow, a next-gen rising star, told me that some of her cohort in the US on visas or green cards had cancelled their trips, worried that they might be detained at the border when returning home. A Canadian editor for theGlobe and Mailtold me they were now sending reporters to the US with burner phones and wiped laptops. A historian at a non-profit specialising in black history told me of cancelled grants.Even Steven Pinker, the Harvard professor and popular science author who has documented what he sees as the upwards path of human progress, was uncharacteristically downbeat. The attacks on universities,including his own, had left him shaken.Meeting Pinker at the conference was another personal landmark. I first went to Ted 20 years ago as a guest of his. I watched Jimmy Wales give a talk on the online encyclopedia that anyone could write and anyone could edit and thought: “Well, that’ll never catch on”, and then he demo-edWikipediaand it blew my mind.I wrote up the event for theObserver,and it was the spark that led to me writing about these topics in a 20-year career with the paper. In 2011 and 2012 we put on our own Ted event, TEDxObserver, which I co-curated with theObserver’s former editor, John Mulholland. Ted and theObserverhave been entwined in my understanding of this world, from excited tech-utopian to where we are now, witnessing Silicon Valley’s merger with an axis of autocracy across the world.These vast data-harvesting tech monopolies that control our online world were never inevitable. And there is another way. We can go back to the future, to the democratic, inspiring, non-corporatised web that Wales proved was possible.We are not powerless. There are things we can do collectively. I learned that when 30,000Observerreaders rose up to support me in my legal case. Last week’s talk is dedicated to them, because without them I don’t know where I’d be now. But together, wewereable to hold power to account. And in the darkness that’s falling, I believe that rebuilding our information system – together – is the first step to getting out of this mess. This is my last signoff for theObserver. It’s been a ride.

I’m noGeoGuessrsavant, but I’ve spent many pleasant hours puzzling over interesting enclaves and panhandles, or pootling around far-flung locales in Street View. After finishing a recent episode of Severance I opened a tab and took an armchair tour through the remote Newfoundland island where it was shot.I’m not exactly uncovering some mysterious corner of the internet here. Google Maps is so ubiquitous it’s become a utility – admitting I open it for fun feels like extolling the virtues of the Calendar app, or calling up Centrelinkjust to enjoy the hold music.

As such, it joins a genre that includes Walter Isaacson’s twin tomes onSteve JobsandElon Musk,Brad Stone’s book on Jeff Bezos, Michael Becraft’s on Bill Gates,Max Chafkin’s on Peter ThielandMichael Lewis’s on Sam Bankman-Fried. Notable characteristics of the genre include a tendency towards founder worship, discreet hagiography and a Whiggish interpretation of the life under examination.The great man under Witt’s microscope is the co-founder and chief executive of Nvidia, a chip design company that went from being a small but plucky purveyor of graphics processing units (GPUs) for computer gaming to its current position as the third most valuable company in the world.Two things drove this astonishing transition. One was Jensen Huang’s intuitive appreciation that Moore’s law – the observation that computing power doubles every two years – was not going to apply for ever, and that a radically different kind of computing architecture would be needed. The other was his decision to bet the future of Nvidia on that proposition and turn the company on a dime, much as Bill Gates had done with Microsoft in the 1990s when he had realised the significance of the internet.Huang was born in Taiwan but brought up in Thailand and the US, of which he is now a citizen. He was a clever, diminutive, driven child who survived bullying at a boarding school in Kentucky but thrived academically. After graduating from Oregon State University he first worked at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a Silicon Valley chip company that competed with semiconductor giant Intel, before moving toLSI Logic, an innovative firm that developed the first design tools for chip architects. So he was in on the semiconductor industry from the very beginning of his career.When Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, two chip designers who worked at Sun Microsystems, the fabled Silicon Valley workstation manufacturer, decided to set up a startup, they asked Huang to join them, on the grounds that he was already an accomplished and successful product manager at LSI. And so Nvidia was born, and Witt’s narrative really gets going.Like most startups, Nvidia had initial ups and downs, but rapidly became known for providing the kind of processors that players of games such asDoomandQuakevalued. Because accurate rendering of imagery in video games required computing power that conventional serial-processing processors struggled to provide, Nvidia moved to experimenting with chips that could do several calculations simultaneously, known as parallel processing, and thus to the development of GPUs.The AI gold rush was on, and Huang was the man selling the picks and shovels – and on his way to a net worth of $100bnParallel processing provided an astonishing advance in computing power and speed. But writing software to harness the technology proved challenging: think of it as switching from thinking in three dimensions to thinking in 5,000. In order to make parallelism more widely usable, Nvidia embarked on a secret project, codenamed Cuda, to create a software platform that would make GPUs – hitherto used only for gaming – into tools that could be useful for any task requiring brute computing power.Cuda turned out to be a masterstroke in two ways: first, it immediately increased the range of applications in which GPUs could be deployed – and therefore the size of the potential market; and second, although the software was free, it only worked with Nvidia hardware!The only remaining problem was to find a market with an insatiable demand for high-end processors. And, as luck would have it, one such market hove into view, sailing under the banner of AI (AKA large language models), the training of which required unconscionable amounts of computing power. Suddenly the tech giants developed an insatiable hunger for Nvidia’s little supercomputer modules. The AI gold rush was on, and Huang was the man selling the picks and shovels – and on his way to a net worth of $100bn.It’s a great story and Witt tells it well. He paints a rounded picture of a remarkable entrepreneur – part visionary, part maniacal workaholic, part inspiring corporate leader. Oh, and part ranting screamer: “yelling at people is part of his motivational strategy”, says one employee; he has “embraced candour to the extreme” says another, tongue firmly in cheek. So it’s a “warts and all” portrait, asOliver Cromwellwould have put it.And just to underline that point: when, in his final interview for the book, Witt asks him what new jobs might be created by AI, Jensen loses it and starts shouting at him. “His anger seemed uncontained, omnidirectional, and wildly inappropriate,” he writes. “I was not Jensen’s employee, and he had nothing to gain from raging at me. He just seemed tired of being asked about the negative aspects of the tools he was building. He thought the question was stupid, and he had been asked it one too many times.”The Thinking Machine: Jensen Huang, Nvidia and the World’s Most Coveted Microchipby Stephen Witt is published by Bodley Head (£25).

But in the US’s new age of irrationalism and chaos, these two men are now of one voice, pursuing a strand of Trumpist politics that sometimes feels strangely overlooked. With Trump once again in the White House and Kennedy ensconced as his health and human services secretary, what they are jointly leading is becoming clearer by the day: a war on science and knowledge that aims to replace them with the modern superstitions of conspiracy theory.Nearly 2,000 members of the US’s National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicinehave warnedof “slashing funding for scientific agencies, terminating grants to scientists, defunding their laboratories, and hampering international scientific collaboration”. Even work on cancer isnow under threat. But if you want to really understand the Trump regime’s monstrousness, consider whereKennedy and a gang of acolytesare heading on an issue that goes to the heart of millions of lives: autism.Last Wednesday,Kennedy spokeat a press conference staged in response to a report about apparently rising rates of autism published by the US’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And out it all came: an insistence that autism is an “epidemic” and a “preventable disease”, and – in complete defiance of the science – that the root cause lies with “environmental toxins”. A range of new studies, he said, will begin reporting back in September: with the same banality that defines his boss’s promises on international conflict and global economics, he told his audience that answers would be presented to the public “very, very quickly”.Most of the people present would have been aware ofKennedy’s past supportfor the thoroughly discredited idea that autism is somehow linked to the use of vaccines. As he spoke, they were presumably reminded of the occasions when he has talked about autistic people with a mixture of disgust and complete ignorance. Autism, he said, “destroys” families; today’s autistic children “will never pay taxes. They’ll never hold a job. They’ll never play baseball. They’ll never write a poem. They’ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.” Those comments have rightly triggered a huge backlash. But what has been rather lacking is a broader critique of Kennedy’s ideas, and how they go deep into aspects of the US’s culture and politics.As I explain inthe book I have just writtenabout my autistic son, James, I began my immersion in autism and the arguments that swirl around it 15 years ago, when he received his diagnosis from the NHS. That came amid visits from speech therapists and educational psychologists, and increasingly futile appointments with a paediatrician, who in effect told us to go away and manage as best we could. But straight away, I was also aware of a much more exotic subculture rooted in the US, based around the idea that autism could somehow be cured, and an array of regimens and pseudo-treatments.1:00'I asked you a simple question, Bobby': Sanders grills RFK Jr on vaccines and autism – videoThe anxieties surrounding Andrew Wakefield’s disgraced work on a link between autism and the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab were still easy to pick up. I read about “chelation”: injecting chemicals into the bloodstream, supposedly to remove the toxic preservatives used in vaccines from the body and send autism on its way. It was easy to find stuff about impossibly restrictive diets, and the terrifying notion offorcing people to drink diluted bleach. These ideas, moreover, came with claims of endless government cover-ups: proto-Maga stuff, which had long been snowballing online.That said, the underlying logic of all this quackery was encouraged by much more mainstream voices. By and large, British campaigning and research tends to focus on what autism actually is, and how to make autistic lives better – whereas in the US, very powerful forces have seen autism as a disease. In 2006, President George W Bush signed a legislative package tellingly called theCombating Autism Act, hailed by one of its supporters as “a federal declaration of waron theepidemic of autism”. At that point, there were initiatives and organisations with names such as Cure Autism Now and Defeat Autism Now! All this had already spawned the autistic self-advocacy movement that continues to loudly contest such ideas, but its appeal obviously still lingers.If I were in the US, I would now have two big worries. As well as constant attacks on the public sector that have alreadyhacked back helpfor autistic people, there is a huge question about what Kennedy’s nonsense might mean for other areas of federal government policy, and the kind of MMR-style panics his “answers” on toxins might trigger. But some of those concerns also apply to the UK, thanks to the ease with which ideas travel, and how Trump and his allies influence politics across the world.Kennedy’s pronouncements are not only about what causes autism; they also reflect an age-old perception of autism as an aberration, and many autistic people as “ineducable” and beyond help. This surely blurs into populists’ loathing of modern ideas about human difference: once you have declared war on diversity, an attack on the idea of neurodiversity will not be far away. It also chimes with one of the new right’s most pernicious elements: its constant insistence that everything is actually much simpler than it looks.RFK Jr contradicts experts by linking autism rise to ‘environmental toxins’Read moreWhich brings me to something it feels painful to have to write. Autism denotes a fantastically complicated set of human traits and qualities, but that does not make them any less real. It presents with and without learning disabilities, and can be synonymous with skills and talents. Its causes (if that is even the right word) are largely genetic, althoughcareful researchis focused on how those heritable aspects might sometimes –sometimes– intersect with factors during pregnancy, and with parental age. And obviously, those characterisations barely scratch the surface, which is some indication of the absurdity of Kennedy’s position, and how dangerous it is.On this side of the Atlantic, there are very good reasons why many of us who have families with autistic members feel deep anxiety about the constant shunting of politics to the right. The care, education and official understanding of the people we love and sometimes look after is fragile enough already: what would happen if their fate was in the hands of the Trumpist know-nothings of Reform UK, or Alternative für Deutschland? The American tragedy unfolding in front of our eyes shows the future we now have to avoid, and the kind of people we may have to fight, who will not just be arrogant and inhumane, but set on taking us back to a failed past: terrible human beings, you might call them.John Harris is a Guardian columnist.

Trump has us headed for a new disasterTerry GarciaCuts to science, environmental and safety agencies are a rejection of hard-won knowledge gained from studying the disaster that occurred 15 years agoSun 20 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Apr 2025 12.40 EDTShareLast month, I joined nearly 500 former and current employees of National Geographic, where I was executive vice-president and chief science and exploration officer for 17 years, urging the institution to take a public stance against the Trump administration’s reckless attacks on science. Ourletterpointed out that the programs being dismantled are “imperative for the success of our country’s economy and are the foundation of our progress and wellbeing. They make us safer, stronger and more prosperous.” We warned that gutting them is a recipe for disaster.In the face of this danger, none of us can remain silent.I say this from the unique perspective of having been closely involved in the two most significant environmental disasters in US history: the Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon oil spills.Fifteen years ago this Sunday, an enormous explosion tore through the BP Deepwater Horizon drilling rig and unleashed an environmental catastrophe that devastated the Gulf of Mexico. The explosion triggered the release of more than 3m barrels of oil that polluted 1,300 miles of coastline from Louisiana to Florida. Eleven lives were lost, ecosystems were ravaged and the economic toll soared into the billions.I served on theNational Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, which investigated the root causes of the disaster, and before that I led the federal government’s implementation of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Restoration Plan. I have witnessed first-hand the human and economic toll exacted by these events. Men and women who, for generations, had made a living from the sea were suddenly confronted with the possibility that an entire way of life would be lost.Despite such painful lessons of the past, we find ourselves once again hurtling toward disaster. The Trump administration’s personnel and programmatic cuts at science, environmental and safety agencies, and the wholesale rollback of environmental regulations, threaten to unravel decades of progress in safeguarding our country. These actions aren’t just misguided – they’re a dangerous rejection of the hard-won knowledge gained from former crises and a gamble we cannot afford to take.Among the many alarming moves by the Trump administration are plans to weaken offshore drilling safety measures implemented in response to the Deepwater Horizon calamity, such as the reversal of theBiden administration’s ban on drillingin sensitive coastal areas, including the Arctic, and the closure of regional offices responsible for oil spill response. Eliminating these measures demonstrates a callous disregard for lessons learned at a staggering human and economic cost.We cannot allow the cautionary tales of Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon to fade into history, only to be repeated when the next horror strikesDisturbingly, these actions are but a small part of a larger effort to weaken environmental regulation and oversight under the guise of restoring government efficiency. Take therecent rollback of dozens of Environmental Protection Agency health and safety regulationsand the reportedplan to eliminatethe agency’s scientific research office. The administration claims these moves will unleash US energy and lower the cost of living, when in fact the only thing they’re guaranteed to achieve is undermining fundamental protections that keep our air and water clean. Themass layoffs and plans to dismemberthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), where I was deputy administrator from 1997 to the end of 1999 and prior to that its general counsel, have nothing to do with cost savings – they’re an outright assault on science. Targeting programs that monitor ocean health, track ecosystem changes and study climate impacts – essential to understanding and mitigating looming threats –will leave us blind to and defenseless againstthe dangers ahead.Cuts to science funding amplify the harms, jeopardizing our ability to innovate solutions, assess risks and respond effectively to crises. In 2010, we lacked even basic data about ocean conditions in areas around the ruptured Deepwater Horizon well. This absence of critical knowledge hindered response and recovery efforts, including understanding the impacts of using oil dispersants in the deep ocean. After the spill, robust government support for science enabled researchers to develop new response and cleanup technologies, better understand long-term ecological impacts, and provide critical insights that helped shape environmental and safety policy. Without government support, these advances would have been impossible – and they will be impossible in the future as funding is slashed.The Trump administration’s insistence that its actions will reduce bureaucratic burdens or spur economic growth is false and deliberately misleading. It’s gaslighting on a national scale. The only sure result is that the burden of risk will be shifted on to communities, small businesses and ordinary Americans. The destruction of habitats and livelihoods is not an abstract consequence of environmental disasters. They devastate families, cripple economies, poison food supplies and leave communities struggling for decades. Businesses are boarded up, and community members suffer life-altering health consequences. After the Deepwater Horizon spill, losses in commercial and recreational fishing, tourism and property values amounted to tens of billions of dollars; cleanup and restoration costs exceeded $60bn – far surpassing what preventive measures would have required.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Science and environmental protections are our first line of defense against catastrophe.

That’s just one of many honors to comeSun 20 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Apr 2025 06.02 EDTShareFrom the start of his first campaign for president 10 years ago, Donald Trump has incessantly presented himself as a winner, the only man in the world who had the temperament to make America great again. As hesaid in 2016:“We’re gonna win so much, you may even get tired of winning. And you’ll say: ‘Please, please. It’s too much winning. We can’t take it any more, Mr President, it’s too much.’ And I’ll say: ‘No it isn’t. We have to keep winning. We have to win more!’”We have to win more!Those words keep haunting me all these years later. Trump, now enjoying his second conquest of the White House, cannot imagine the possibility that he could ever lose.What comes next, then, for a man whowants a Nobel peace prizeand can delude himself into believing that he is winning the trade war he has recently launched?Here are 16 possible future wins for Trump as he relishes the prospect of Guinness World Records soon bringing out a special edition devoted exclusively to the American president’s innumerable victories and laurels.1Columbia University has announced that Donald J Trump will be its next commencement speaker, receiving a doctor of business administration degree, honoris causa. The board of trustees has affirmed that there is absolutely no relationship between these distinctions and its previous concessions to the US government after its threats to withdraw $400m in federal funding from the university. It will continue, a press release stated, to award honors as befits an institution that, like Harvard, is renowned for its independence from all political pressure.2The Nobel peace prize for 2025 has been awarded to Donald J Trump for his efforts to abolish war in our time and his unflagging support for the rights of women and immigrants worldwide. The decision by the Norwegian Nobel committee was accompanied by a plea for an end to Oslo’s coincidental occupation by peace-keeping contingents from the US fleet forces command.3Columbia University’s Pulitzer committee has awarded Donald J Trump a Pulitzer prize in public service for having unleashed the potential of American greatness.4The Society of American Magicians has named Donald J Trump as its escape artist of the year, thanks to his Houdini-like ability to avoid any consequence whatsoever for his multiple encounters with the law.5The Kennedy Center has announced that all five of its 2025 honors in the performing arts will go to Donald J Trump for his past and ongoing contributions to American culture and fine arts. In other news from the capital, the Smithsonian Institution has named the newest building being planned for the Mall as the Donald J Trump White European Heritage Museum.6Columbia University has added another honorary degree to be bestowed on Donald J Trump before his commencement speech: a doctor of humane letters, citing his campaign against false ideologies in our educational establishments.7In a speech by the president during the bestowal of the Nasa distinguished service medal, he thanked the independent agency for renaming the Sombrero galaxy as the Donald J Trump galaxy, a signal, he declared, to alien invaders that they are not welcome in our beautiful homeland.8The Nobel prize in literature has been awarded to Donald J Trump for his ability to meld fiction and non-fiction in hitherto uncharted ways, exercising an immense influence on writers and readers across the planet for generations to come. The Swedish Nobel committee cited the president’s books Save America and Kick Ass and Think Big as outstanding examples of his inimitable style. It also hoped that by the time the American laureate receives this honor from King Carl XVI Gustaf, the US Marines currently camped in Stockholm might be withdrawn from the city. To hasten such an evacuation, further measures may be taken by the committee.9The Lee C Bollinger Forum at Columbia University has been selected as the auditorium where the Arnold J Palmer lifetime service award for sportsmanship while playing golf will be presented to Donald J Trump. The Forum also expects to be the site where Donald J Trump will collect the Nobel prize in economics, the first to be conferred since the Swedish Academy assigned the decision about that award to the board of trustees of the newly created Elon Musk Delete Institute at Columbia University.10Donald J Trump was the 2025 recipient of an unprecedented four Emmy awards in the categories of acting, directing, editing and screen-writing, with a special emphasis on his enduring contributions to innovative forms of reality TV. The president was unable to attend the ceremony in New York as he had flown to San Diego, California, to receive a lifetime achievement award from the Bram Stoker Horror Writers Association for the way in which his entire body of work has substantially influenced terror and dread.11During his investiture as the new chief rabbi of Jerusalem, Donald J Trump called on Iran to follow the example of Israel and elect him as supreme ayatollah, a way to guarantee, he declared, peace between these two nations. The rabbinical service took place at the site where the Trump Gaza Riviera hotel is being built.12The NFL, NBA, NHL and MLB have collectively voted Donald J Trump as the comeback coach of the year for leading Team America to victory against overwhelming odds. The ceremony will take place at the Lerner Roone Arledge Auditorium at Columbia University.13The General Augusto Pinochet Foundation will host Donald J Trump, Vladimir Putin, Marine Le Pen and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in a mass rally at the National Stadium in Santiago de Chile to celebrate them as defenders of democracy.14The Oxford Union has announced that Donald J Trump will debate himself in an upcoming session devoted to the question: “Is Donald J Trump the greatest American president of all time?” The unique decision to invite Mr Trump to argue twice in favor of the proposal as to his greatness was only reached after a judicious consideration of his outstanding rhetorical skills, which constantly keep his audience in suspense regarding what he will say or do next.15Columbia University’s Pulitzer committee has awarded Donald J Trump two retroactive Pulitzers in non-fiction and biography for The Art of the Deal, with apologies for having overlooked this seminal work when it was published.16The conclave of cardinals has chosen Donald J Trump as the new pope, citing his deep respect for the unborn and his wise stewardship of the environment and compassion for the poor. In a press release, the Vatican expressed the hope that the F-117 stealth fighters that have been deploying tactical nuclear weapons while hovering over Rome during this week might be ordered by the Air Force Strike Command back to their base in Aviano once the new pontiff is installed. The president is expected to easily pass thetesticle testthat every Holy Father must undergo, given that lots of people say that he has balls the likes of which have never been seen before.Ariel Dorfman, a distinguished professor emeritus of literature at Duke University, is the Chilean American author of the play Death and the Maiden and the novel The Suicide Museum and, more recently, Allegro, narrated playfully by MozartExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Surely doomsday is nighSun 20 Apr 2025 05.01 EDTShareAgroup of six women returned to Earth from space on Monday, including Katy Perry, the former wife of the Trump cheerleader Russell Brand; and the former Fox news presenter and philanthropist Lauren Sánchez, fiancee of Donald Trump’s media lapdog Jeff Bezos, who bentWashington Posteditorial policy to favour the New American Fascism ™ ®. It’s a shame they didn’t fly straight into the heart of the sun.The six compliant women were sent to space as a costly PR exercise for Bezos’s commercial space flight ambitions, although Perry said it was actually about “finding the love for yourself” and “feeling that divine feminine”. Tell that to all the women worldwide whom Bezos’s pal Trump’s policies are penalising. Singing idiot.Katy Perrysaid she kissed a girl and she liked it. As Trump rolls back on LGBTQ+ rights I’m surprised the Trump-adjacent Bezos allowed a bi-curious woman into space. I suppose discussions of sexual identity don’t matter if they’re mere titillation. And if Perry is bisexual, she is at least less likely to influence vulnerable young people while orbiting the Earth.Sánchez, meanwhile, is vice-chairman of Bezos’s Bezos Earth Fund, an environmental group thatended its fundingof decarbonisation initiatives in February, in line with Bezos’s support of Trump, who denies climate change while simultaneously seeing that a defrosting Greenland offers superb mineral mining opportunities. Why are all these wankers so totally and unashamedly full of shit?So I have come to Cornwall for a week, but still I can’t escape the news. As I drove the Penwith peninsula in search of sacred underground Cornish fogous to decompress in, the dead car radio suddenly found a frequency to tell me Perry had sadly survived her Bezos-boosting spaceflight. If those women really cared about the future of the planet they’d have sabotaged themselves to discredit Trump’s big tech donor, but they selfishly chose not to. History will be their judge.Ostensibly I’m here to see the Tate St Ives exhibition of the mighty 20th-century surrealistIthell Colquhoun, whose greatest works were inspired by the landscapes of Cornwall, and who died in its loving arms in 1988. Like the late standup comedian Jethro, Colquhoun is indivisible from the land that nurtured her talent, and both created works called This Train Don’t Stop Camborne Wednesdays, though only one features an impressionistic portrayal of the vulva as twin columns of flame.I’m the Ralph McTell of champagne socialist satire. Let me take you by the hand.Thirty years ago I’d pick up Colquhoun’s signed books, their value unacknowledged by vendors, in secondhand shops and wonder at her obscurity. But tides turn, and now she is venerated, 47 years from her passing. Maybe one day I may yet help Bloomsbury’s Museum of Comedy stage that long mooted Jethro retrospective? But first, I have to file my finalObservercolumn.My sister asks why I am not appearing at Norwich Theatre Royal, and so do I, as my tour shows always sell it out, sometimes twice over. I begin rambling about “visibility”, and how a whole generation of us, as printed news and trustworthy current affairs television began to wither, came to rely on social media to bob us along on its churning sewage-strewn surface. Then Trump’s tech bros skewed the algorithms away from liberal content and, in Google’s case, even agreed to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to appease him. History is mutable, it seems.I can feel people glazing over as I explain this. What does the end of verifiable information matter to them? After all,The White Lotuswas fine, despite the flawed final episode, and that’s enough surely? And all politicians are as bad as one another anyway. And I realise I sound like that American bloke on acid at a Butthole Surfers gig in 1988 saying The Man is controlling our minds with miniature ear robots and hidden smells. But this time around, all those stoned paranoid imaginings are finally true!We put our futures, and it seems the future of facts themselves, in the hands of bent balding billionaires, still nursing a grudge against the kids from their high school who played guitar or drew cool comics. The Trump administration, accommodated by the likes of Keir Starmer and Katy Perry, is the geopolitical equivalent of a football player stuffing the face of the boy who won the spelling competition into the toilet bowl. For ever.Here’s where we, and random Venezuelans with random tattoos, start paying. Sometimes, I think one routine I wrote about immigration sometime in the early 00s was shared by socials so often it basically gave me a career, culminating in theTimescalling me the world’s greatest living standup comedian by osmosis. I’m the Ralph McTell of champagne socialist satire. Let me take you by the hand.But now everything has changed. Campaigns, comedians, critics, charities, writing careers and worthy causes that gained traction in the tiny toilet window between the downturn in print media and the twin horrors of Musk’s annexation of Twitter and Google’s apparent abandonment of its “Don’t Be Evil” mantra would never flourish today. We give birth astride the grave. The light gleams an instant as Twitter helps Tracey Thorn from Everything But the Girl become a bestselling author. Then it’s night once more.I think someone needs to build a new global news network, disinvested from media money men and Trump knee-benders, to save objective truth as we know it. Maybe Andrew Neil could do it, using the skills he learned from kickstarting GB News?

The Easter story suggests notJustine TohReligion hasn’t always championed the body, but the physical world can be just as important as the spiritual oneSun 20 Apr 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Apr 2025 19.22 EDTShareIrecently discovered a counsellor who is always available and supportive, won’t reject or judge me, and finds me endlessly compelling. Unfortunately, there’s a catch – the counsellor is a Jesus chatbot churning out therapy speak, Bible verses and divine love on demand.It took three minutes with the bot to realise this was my version of hell – and I’m a Christian. AI assistants, at my beck and call, reflect me back at me; the last thing I need is a God bot to do the same.There’s one line especially that the Jesus chatbot can’t deliver with any conviction, one that is fast becoming a mantra tethering me to reality in an overly virtual world: “This is my body, broken for you.”It’s what the real Jesus said at his last supper while handing out bread and referencing his looming, and apparently willing, execution by the grisliest means ever invented: crucifixion. This is theEasterevent that millions of Christians observed this past weekend.Waiting for God(ot): can boredom be a kind of spiritual practice? | Jackie BaileyRead moreI find the fleshliness of the story a reality check, one that gets me out of my head. Not least because the more life is online, the more I’m assuming disembodiment and disembodied connections with others are the norm.It’s not that I distrust all virtual relationships. Take the humble group chat. My best friends and I aim for fortnightly dinners but chat every day or so in between real-life catchups. It works because WhatsApp is no substitute for seeing each other in person.But the direction of travel for online relationships tends towards more, not less, virtuality. Silicon Valley’s entire business model seems reliant on us being with each other “in spirit”, say, rather than “in the flesh”.It’s why disembodied parasocial relationships – the one-sided emotional ties we form with distant others – have taken off in the internet age. Think of fangirling Substack authors you’ll never meet, or OnlyFans subscribers lusting after their favourite content creators: everyone is real (for now), but no meaningful relationship exists between them.What if one party isn’t real, but a real-seeming connection exists? People falling inlovewith chatbots are next-level parasocial relationships involving real emotional responses to unreal others.A sex therapistrecentlytold the New York Times that it didn’t matter if human-AI (or human-God, for that matter) relationships were real since relationships are “just neurotransmitters being released in our brain”. She said:I have those neurotransmitters with my cat. Some people have them with God. It’s going to be happening with a chatbot. We can say it’s not a real human relationship. It’s not reciprocal. But those neurotransmitters are really the only thing that matters, in my mind.A devastating KO, apparently, for anyone who believes that what makes somethingrealis the fact that it doesn’tjusthappen in their heads. Well, too bad, says the sex therapist, we basically live in the Matrix where the “you” I dream up is the only one that counts. Ruled out is the possibility of genuine encounters with the other. We don’t want the other person, or cat, or God so much as the neural buzz they generate.The more we do life online, the more lost we are in a hall of mirrors where algorithms reflect people’s desires back at them, and nothing is ultimately real beyond the blizzard of electrical signals swirling around their brain. Even the body falls out of view.The new mum group chat can be perilous. A simple rule can help navigate the minefield | Natasha MooreRead moreIt’s why I find the physicality of the Easter story so powerful, at the centre of which is Jesus’ broken and then resurrected body: it’s a welcome tether to the real and a reality outside myself.Which might sound weird: religion – including some Christian traditions – hasn’t always championed the body, being more hung up on “spirit” at the expense of “flesh”.But that’s a mistake. A core Christian claim is that Jesus is God’s all-powerful “word made flesh” – a perfect union of the spiritual and physical, Heaven and Earth. For Christians, there’s no getting around the reality that the body – and this earthly life – matters.Then there’s the bit where Jesus willingly puts his own body on the line for all, regardless of whether we want him to (“This is my body, broken for you”). At the very least, a reminder that unlike AI companions who exist to please you, real people will confound, frustrate, elude you. Like anyone else, Jesus is his own person acting in the world, and those actions aren’t reducible to whatever sense your neurons make of them. Reality isn’t just what you make of it in your head.Which is why, by the way, talk of resurrection is such a bold move. The early Christians claimed Jesus rose bodily, not spiritually, from the dead. If true, it’s the ultimate guarantee that the real world shifted on its axis that first Easter. The body, both now and forevermore, is the really real. Something solid to grip on to in a virtual age when it seems surplus to requirements.Justine Toh is Senior Research Fellow at the Centre for Public ChristianityExplore more on these topicsChristianityMaking sense of itReligionEasterArtificial intelligence (AI)commentShareReuse this content"

As the Mail and Telegraph’s headlines were quick to inform their readers, yes, this means a “Black actor” in that iconic role.There is a real concern that Essiedu is drinking from a poisoned chalice – that he will be associated with an author who isat the forefrontof a gender-critical movement that has succeeded in redefining the rights of trans people to their detriment; that he will have to weather the racist storm ofPotterheadsenraged at the diversion from “book accuracy” (Snape is described as having “sallow skin”); and deal with opportunists looking to illustrate their next rant about how the world has succumbed to “woke orthodoxy”. All of this in a show that is slated to last a decade.I’m sceptical about colour-blind casting, especially when it’s presented as a magic bullet for diversity concerns in the arts – but I can’t help but enjoy the audacity of Black Snape. If any performances from the original films were going to be rethought considerably – considering that casting so far is relatively aligned in appearance, bar a more handsome Quirrell – Snape is the most obvious choice. Alan Rickman’s depiction was so singular that any actor who hewed closely to it would likely be written off as doing a pastiche. He is also arguably the most complex and tragic figure in the series, inviting the most interpretation. So why not play around with it a bit?Many detractors are insistent that they would’ve been OK with, say, a Black Dumbledore or a Black Professor McGonagall, but that the details of Snape’s arc within the series are made invariably more touchy and loaded if the character is Black. Harry and his friends’ suspicion of their potions professor is down to sensing a menacing, scheming intent behind his cold disposition. Cue the imagined new Snape going:Is it cause I’m Black?Harry’s dad, James, and his friends bullied Snape at school in the 1970s, making him levitate and then hanging him upside down. If unchanged in the new series (this somewhat depends on the casting of James’s friends) this could now look like an image of racist bullying. Perhaps that would make James Potter irredeemable, particularlyconsidering the real experiencesof Black people in boarding schools – or it could simply deepen the series’ depiction of vulnerability and torment.View image in fullscreenAlan Rickman as Severus Snape with Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley and Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, 2005.Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarIt is worth pointing out that Snape being portrayed by a Black actor isn’t automatically the same as there being a “Black Snape”. HBO could simply gloss over the racial implications behind such a decision – after all, the bigotries and oppression system of “muggles” do not neatly map on to the magical world.But, if executed well, this casting represents an opportunity. I am incredibly intrigued by this idea of a Black man who is socially ostracised in his youth and then joins the Death Eaters (akin to an extremist, white supremacist party in the real world); who realises the errors in his ways, and gives his life in service of redeeming this mistake. The story alone doesn’t necessarily need the dynamics of race, but who in our current times may be better placed to represent such internal conflict, yearning for acceptance and a defection from such ideologies than a Black actor?In Clint Dyer and Roy Williams’ play Death of England, Essiedumasterfully playeda Black working-class Brexit-voting bailiff in what was a compelling psychological profile of the alienation experienced in desperately trying to reconcile aspirations for whiteness in a world that hates you. Similarly, Snape’s backstory of joining the Death Eaters is complicated by him being a “half blood” who joins a blood purity cult advocating for a standard he does not meet.Rather than a hasty imposition on the text, dig a little and a Black Snape starts to look like a much richer prospect – and yes, not too complex for a children’s series where all the themes of prejudice, identity and acceptanceare already present. Whether the creators will approach the issue with such consideration, sensitivity and context however remains to be seen.Quiet as it’s been kept,Paapa Essieduis one of the finest British actors that I’ve ever had the privilege to see perform– he is eminently commanding on the stage, emotionally precise and able to balance humour and solemnity. In his Emmy-nominated turn in Michaela Coel’sI May Destroy You, he expertly captured the sense of beinghaunted by trauma. So why shouldn’t he cash in on one of the series’ most iconic roles rather than settle for a minor side character so as not to upset those who would only find something else in the series to complain about anyway?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many thousands have trodden along you, and so have I. You’ve brought us blisters but also beautiful views, buoyed spirits and a renewed sense of belonging.I got the idea to walk the Pennine Way – whichon 24 April turns 60– after being racially abused on a TransPennine train journey. A man asked me if I had a British passport, threatened to set me on fire and told me to go back to where I’m from. The latter hit a nerve: I am from theNorth of Englandand proud of it. One day I was looking at a map of that journey and saw the Pennine mountains rising up. I zoomed closer and saw a place called Hope, and I determined that I’d walk through the glorious place I’m from and try to channel hope throughout.Walking was transformative to my physical and mental health. I’d been suffering from anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder – racism and inequality affect mental health.Walkingwas ameliorative as I focused my attention on the wonders of wildlife, burned away stress by the River Ribble and felt my heart beat louder as I hiked on up through the Yorkshire Dales, stopping to marvel at the view from Pen-y-ghent as the clouds began to clear.I walked along the “backbone” of the country – as the Pennines are known due to their astonishing limestone cliff formations – as a way of showing backbone myself: I won’t let racial abuse stop me adventuring in a country where I belong.My journey was inspired by the Manchester Ramblers from my home town, who walked against exclusion in the Kinder Scout mass trespass – which celebrates its93rd anniversaryalso on 24 April. Their walk helped improve access to the countryside, paving the way for the formation of the Peak District (the country’s first national park), the Pennine Way, and the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.The Manchester Ramblers – immortalised in Ewan MacColl’s song – showed that they could help walk the world to a better future. It’s important to ensure that their hard-won freedoms aren’t eroded: England’s national parks areimperilled due to budget cuts. It’s vital we speak up for their existence, for their belonging here.View image in fullscreenAnita Sethi at Sycamore Gap on Hadrian’s Wall, Pennine Way.Photograph: Anita SethiThere were moments when I thought I couldn’t go on – not least after almosttoppling offMalham Cove – but what fuelled my footsteps, alongside the extraordinary landscape, was a burning sense of defiance. In Settle in the Yorkshire Dales, I saw a plaque commemorating the journey of Alfred Wainwright, who walked the Way in 1938 and wrote A Pennine Journey,published in 1986.Reading it was enraging on account of the misogynistic stereotypes – Wainwright writes about “the wild joys of boyhood” and comments: “I’ve wondered many a time: have the ladies the same capacity for enthusiasm? … I have not yet witnessed genuine enthusiasm in one of them; often I have seen a pretence of it, but the divine spark was missing.” I may be missing the “divine spark”, but my enthusiasm powered me on over mountains, valleys and considerable obstacles, all the way to the sadly now felledSycamore Gap treeat Hadrian’s Wall.Toxic prejudices still persist about who belongs here and who is capable. My book, titled I Belong Here,isa chronicle of my Pennine journey and also a clarion call for rightful belonging in the face of hostile and persistent exclusion of minorities from societal power structures, and media, and publishing and literary landscapes. Ironically one agent advised me to take out the word “Pennines”, because “the book won’t sell as no one cares about the north”. I was also told that someone like me couldn’t be a travel and nature writer – the subtext being that I was not white and/or male so I did notfitwith the “lone enraptured male” profile prevalent in this genre (Wainwright might be turning in his grave to know I was shortlisted for a nature-writing prize named after him. My PE teacher would be surprised too.)As we celebrate this great walking path, it’s worth remembering how far there still is to go for all to be safe and free and welcome while walking through the world. In England, 92% of the land isnot coveredby the right to roam, contrasting with Scotland, where the public has access to walk through most of it as long as they do so responsibly. England’s land isstill entrenchedin centuries-old feudal inequality. And as women walking, we face greater levels of harassment outdoors, the vulnerabilities heightened for a woman of colour with risk of racist harassment.The Guardian view on the Pennine Way: a pioneer of long-distance soul therapy | EditorialRead moreLong-distance hiking is a lesson in stoicism in the face of obstacles. It’s an apt metaphor for the journey through life – little wonder that the walk has been a literary trope for centuries. But rather than approaching the Way as a competitive sport, I did it my way, as it were; I didn’t care about finishing fastest but wanted to savour each step instead.So happy birthday, dear Pennine Way. Five years on from my epic journey, I’m trying to keep walking a hopeful path. I hope if anyone who’s reading this today (or in 60 years), feels stuck or lost in life, or crushed by discrimination, that you don’t give up, that you keep on going; that you believe you belong here, because you do. I hope you’ll keep going for the view along the way as well as from the top of the mountain.Anita Sethi is the author ofI Belong Here: A Journey Along the Backbone of Britainand is featured in the new exhibition A Trail of Inspiration: the Pennine Way at 60Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s been so long since I was a teenager that I had honestly forgotten how much snogging used to happen at school, until it was mentioned in the House of Commons this week. (I have never been a fan of the word snogging, yet as a term it’s powerfully evocative of late 1990s-early 2000s adolescence, conjuring a heady mix of Impulse body spray and Lynx Africa, the taste of Juicy Fruit chewing gum, and the sound of braces clashing.)Teenage love is in the headlines, because of the news that there will be a“Romeo and Juliet” exemptionto the new crime and policing bill obliging professionals in England, including teachers and healthcare workers, to report suspicions of child sexual abuse. The exemption for teenagers in consensual sexual relationships received cross-party support, recognising that “not all sexual activity involving under-18s is a cause for alarm or state intervention”.This is all common sense, andsimilar approachesare already in place in countries such as Australia and France. That teenagers engage in sexual activity should be news to no one – obliging teachers to report every instance as a potential child sexual offence will give them an even higher workload than they face already. Instead, they can use their professional judgment. Safeguards remain in place: if there is any indication of harm or imbalance, the duty to report remains.It confirms what many of us have long known: that often the most present threat to teenage girls are those older guys who just can’t seem to get a girlfriend their own age. You know the kind. The groomers. Guys who are 19, 20, older, who hang around the school gates in their Saxos and Corsas. In my home town, one actually went on the run with – or arguably abducted – a just turned 13-year-old girl. Others would invite underage girls to their shitty flats and ply them with alcohol. Alongside these men you had the even older ones in positions of power – at my own school, the biggest threat to teen girls was ouractual headteacher(Neil Foden was eventually convicted of multiple offences).It would be utterly absurd to put such criminal abuse and exploitation on a par with teenage fumbling. The use of Romeo and Juliet to describe the clause may at first seem rather grandiose, but isn’t that just how love, or at least lust, feels at that age? Intense, powerful, tragic even. That feeling of “If I can’t kiss him right this very second against the science block stairs, then I might as well drink poison”. I suspect its resonance is the reason it’s on the syllabus for pupils just about coming up to Juliet’s age (13). It also provides a framework for discussing these issues in class (“I know you feel like the main character in your own Shakespearean tragedy right now, but maybe put down the deadly nightshade and listen to someLana Del Reyinstead?”)I remember how Amy, who sat next to me in English, could recite most of the play by heart. “O brawling love! O loving hate!” – I can still hear her voice now. That Romeo is saying these words about Rosaline, before he abruptly switches his affection to Juliet, was lost on us. It was in vain that our English teacher tried to get us to think about how Shakespeare might have been commenting on the fickleness of young love. There’s no telling you when you’re in the middle of it, is there? Yet there’s an argument that we should taketeenagers’ romantic feelings more seriously, because they can go on to shape us.Today’s teens are lucky, in many ways. They are not experiencing their first love, or lust, against a backdrop of alarming teenage pregnancy rates, as we were. They receive better sex education, at an earlier age, have access to more variedmethods of contraception, and aregenerally more clued up about the biology of reproduction. We certainly weren’t making TikToks about the luteal phase – we didn’t even know what it meant, let alone how it might affect your dating behaviour.One thing hasn’t changed, though, and that’s howvulnerable teenagers are, and how easily their hearts can be broken. We thought we were so grown up when we were fooling around at 15, going on dates to Pizza Hut, dissecting our relationships on MSN and rolling ridiculous 10-skin joints so we could hotbox caravans. We were just kids, like the teens I see walking to school or on the bus now, so impossibly young and naive, but fizzing with hormones that made you want to jump each other.While jumping each other on a Tuesday morning outside set two maths isn’t often going to be a reportable offence, anyone who works with young people knows that their vulnerable hearts need some sort of safeguarding, too. Perhaps, alongside all the work that needs to be done in terms of consent and online misogyny and how to recognise abusive relationships, we all need formal lessons in heartbreak – after all, these years can shape our adult relationships to come and who we are. I wonder about the role they play in later infidelities, too. Most of us are happy to leave those Impulse-scented years behind us, but we all know someone who will always chase that Juicy Fruit high.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and authorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And witness Tony Benn, in 1974, offering a financial lifeline to 3,000 workers forming a cooperative to save motorcycle manufacture at the failed BSA plant in Meriden, near Coventry.Although 50 years apart, they both reflect the inability of the British financial and ownership system to make common cause with the state to drive forward vital innovation – and the regular crises that result. BSA’s demise is a moment etched in my memory. As a young stockbroker, I had lost a good part of my savings in carelessly buying and selling BSA shares in the hours before it became defunct.As I ruefully took the bus home, I was angry not only at my idiocy but also at a financial system whose relationship with a great company was captured by dealing in its shares like casino chips even in its death throes – and into which I had been sucked. It was emblematic of a decades-old disengagement and lack of commitment to invest and support BSA, instead prioritising the capacity to pay annual dividends. More of this and Britain would be an industrial wasteland. Something had to change. One of the good outcomes from British Steel’s rescue is that, at last, this may be about to happen.There has been a retreat from the commitment to renewable energy, spearheaded by the right, with cheap renewable power cast as ‘woke’Like BSA, British Steel has never operated within a financial and ownership ecosystem supported by public policy that sees its objective as investment and value creation. Even when nationalised, it was simply an unwanted ward of state financed by a neglectful Treasury. By contrast,China, like Japan before it, aims to be the industrial and manufacturing powerhouse of the 21st century and puts the creation of value and investment in frontier technologies at the heart of its economics and politics – marshalled by a ruthless, autocratic, one-party state that knows its legitimacy depends on a successful economy.China’s state-owned banking system is its weapon, locked in by capital controls that force it to make vast subsidised loans as directed by successive five-year economic plans. China’s technological prowess, and in particular the way it has implemented its decision 20 years ago to leapfrog the industrialised west by transitioning to a green economy built on cheap renewable energy rather than expensive, imported fossil fuels, has been built on bank debt. This debt is nowmore than 300% of GDP– a dangerous ratio that triggered first the Japanese and then the western banking crises.But Chinese steelmaking, now half of world production, is a major beneficiary. Efficient electric arc steelmaking, requiring temperatures of up to 3,000C, needs huge volumes of cheap electricity provided by renewables. Already, renewable energy supplies two-fifths of China’s capacity: it will double by 2030.Jingye, with £40bn of turnover, is located in China’s biggest steel-producing province, Hebei, just north of Beijing. Like every “private” firm in China, it has a supervisory committee of party members to ensure it complies with party wishes as set out in the national plans, as do the state banks that lend to it. This is capitalism married to Marxist-Leninism. British Steel’s fate was sealed 15 months ago when Hebei province released its “Guidelines for transitionfinance in the iron and steel industry”, conforming to the 14th five-year nationwide plan: electric arc steelmaking powered by renewables was to become the province’s industry standard.Scunthorpe was never going to get near those criteria.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, there has been a collective retreat, spearheaded by the British right, with cheap renewable power cast as “woke”. Worse, British electricity pricing policy is organised to make the least efficient gas-fired power station capable of entering the grid, so locking electricity prices into expensive fossil fuels.Yet it was Donald Trump’s tariffs that forced the decision, with China facing the growing risk of a banking crisis if its overindebted steel and power industries could not service their loans. Doubtless the Communist party committee overseeing Jingye will have agreed its action – but as much to save itself as to do down Britain. Trump’s tariff war is simultaneously threatening not only the US financial system – but China’s. Jingye’s very survival is at stake.Jonathan Reynolds may have won sweeping powers to control British Steel to an extent Benn never dreamed of – but its future remains murky. If Britain is to avoid being the only G7 country incapable of making virgin steel, there needs to be more hard thinking about the reforms to make that possible.The UK will need a wholesale overhaul of its energy policy and an accompanying commitment to renewables to lower energy prices, massive investment in electric arc furnaces and a national strategic plan to get British steel users to buy locally. If the company is ever to go private, some combination of thenational wealth fund, British Business Bank and British pension funds and insurance companies will have to anchor its ownership and commit to investment. British Steel must become part of the new economy, not a prisoner of the old.The prospect would have been laughable until very recently. But there are signs of change. The national wealth fund and British Business Bank exist. Today’s City is much more aware that its strength is interdependent with the strength of the British economy; there is to be a second “Mansion House compact” this summer in which pension fund managers commit to invest up to 10% of their funds in innovative startups and scaleups. The government is committed to an industrial strategy and is preparing to overhaul energy pricing policy to better reflect the cheapness of renewables.The free market economics that warranted all the disengagement and lack of interest that drove de-industrialisation and decline is at a dead end. Companies that fail are part and parcel of capitalism; what makes failure acceptable is if they are accompanied by companies that succeed – thus the importance of creating the ecosystem in which more of that happens. There is a long way to go, but Britain could be feeling its way to answers that have eluded it for decades.Will Hutton is an Observer columnistExplore more on these topicsBritish SteelOpinionChinaFinancial sectorIndustrial policyRenewable energyEnergySteel industrycommentShareReuse this content"

As a reasonably attentive student of generational divides, I’m still late to one of the most dramatic divergences yet: the normalisation of snail slime.At some point, maybe around the time I stopped believing in face cream miracles, smearing on snail mucus, in serums or lotions, was hailed by newcomers to Korean-made skin products as transformative, almost immediately. Its most cherished effect being, as an industry spokeswomantold BritishVoguein 2023, “a radiant youthful glow”. Today, thanks more to rhapsodising influencers than age-defying evidence, the slime phenomenon persists, gathers converts and withstands objections from snail supporters, who do not, sadly, seem that numerous. What snails need now, perhaps more than any other animal, is celebrity allies, supposing there are any willing to sacrifice the magical power of slime.Early ethical concerns about the snails’ treatment were satisfied, to a remarkable extent, by industry assurances, duly recited by slime fans, that the slime makers are treated like kings, even when sprayed in their thousands with acidic solution that prompts slime secretion as a defence mechanism. After a few such sessions these snails are caringly euthanised.Yet more blessed gastropods, according to a popular K-Beauty brand, SeoulCeuticals, live out their days in less stressful “snail havens, allowing snails to meander freely over mesh setups, mimicking their natural environment”.Either way, all snails, fortunate and not, are natural, and thus appeal to key demographics in the soaring market for snail beauty products: millennials and gen Z, “who actively seek skin-friendly, cruelty-free beauty solutions”. In a masterstroke by the beauty industry, gen Z consumers (aged under 28) have begun spending on anti-ageing while still young. The value of the snail beauty product market has been projected as$3.4bn by 2034.The industry can also take credit for what appears to be, though not that helpfully for the snails, much diminished levels of snail- and slime-related revulsion. This is hard to quantify, but not so long ago Patricia Highsmith’s affection and respect for snails, which she wrote about and kept as pets, was routinely portrayed as bizarre and repellent. Her 1948 short story,The Snail Watcher, featuring a kind of awful snail apotheosis, was initially rejected by periodicals “with horror and disgust”. Highsmith’s habit of transporting pet snails in her handbag or, for smuggling purposes, her bra (10 under each breast) was likewise presented, before the arrival of snail slime beauty, as deficient if not actively disgusting. Now, in a eulogy to a Korean snail product,Voguerhapsodises about “a slime-y texture that is a sensorial experience on its own”.Along with the slime-tolerance evinced by generations often considered super-sensitive, levels of incuriosity about the snail slime industry are such as to make you wonder, if you still recoil from the whole thing, if that makes you one of the weird ones. What’s wrong with you! Why wouldn’t you feel fine about industrialised snail labour for a product with uncertain benefits if the snail industry says it’s OK? Especially for slime that could give you the prized, regularly slimed look known as “glass skin”.The effect of tariffs might amount to a more important commercial pushback than anything achieved by animal welfare organisationsBeing beyond any expectation of rejuvenation, I can’t, admittedly, be certain that having a reflective face would not once have seemed worth the torment and premature death of any number of gastropods. But expert consensus, not just in beauty magazines is, overwhelmingly, that it is. Including for anAtlanticmagazine writerspeculating, with some feeling, about the impact of tariffs on Korean beauty product prices – could US glass skin go the same, chilling way as US free speech? The trade-off between snail and human wellbeing is evidently settled. “It has made my skin softer and only grossed me out twice,” she tells us.From the snails’ perspective, the effect of tariffs – if they drive US buyers back to domestic, non-snail slime products – might amount to a more important commercial pushback than anything so far achieved by animal welfare organisations. While the soaring demand for slime products could encourage recourse to unethical types of extraction, Peta (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) has just triedanother intervention, warning that “snails are not skincare tools. They can feel stress, pain and fear.” Secrecy by some within the industry, along with a moderately stressed snail looking, to an amateur, much like a relaxed one, makes this easier to claim than to demonstrate.Even so, in the limited snail mucin studies concerned with ethics, the animals’ treatment by some manufacturers sounds, when not actively barbaric, difficult to reconcile with industry assurances. The slime is, after all, a stress response. There isfilm of snailsfrothing and retracting into their shells.Ananalysis by the University of TennesseeHealth Science Center found that common methods of snail slime collection include, as well as allegedly low-stress techniques that deliver less product, electrical stimulation, the application of salt solution (“osmotically drawing out a snail’s hydration”) and the use of force (featuring “objects such as glass rods, cotton swabs, syringes, droppers, sticks or needles”) to increase the yield. Alternatively, the shell might be cracked, generating more mucus, or the extractors might try vibrational, ozone-assisted and ultrasonic stimulation: “These methods are less favoured as snails often die easily.” The authors prioritise, in conclusion, “the need for ethical extraction”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At some point, the popularity of mucus might give way to another miracle face-plumper, possibly a synthetic version of snail mucin. Alternatively, if the snails get lucky, this resourceful industry will discover superior secretions in another unfortunate animal, ideally one similarly docile, cheap and unlovable enough to be euthanised in its millions.Not that consumers seem to be too picky. No matter how distressing the process, it’s not so distressing, even among the usually tender-hearted, as the prospect of looking old.Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnistExplore more on these topicsBeautyOpinionAnimal welfarecommentShareReuse this content"

Brother Nigel has popped up on the government’s left flankby demanding the immediate nationalisationof the steel industry. He’s also expressed a solidarity with trades unionists hitherto undetected in this longtime admirer of Margaret Thatcher.At an event at a working men’s club in one of the more deprived wards of County Durham, theold fraud even claimedto have a personal affinity with steelworkers because he used to be in the “metals business” himself. This was a disingenuous reference to his time as a trader at the London Metal Exchange, which involved long lunches in the City fuelled with copious quantities of port. Or maybe he was thinking of his gig as a paid “brand ambassador” for a firm that deals in gold bullion.Many descriptions come to mind when contemplating the leader of Reform UK, but I’m finding it a stretch of the mental elastic to get to working-class hero. Maybe he’s forgottenhis recent voteagainst outlawing fire-and-rehire and his party’s opposition to banning zero-hours contracts.So what is going on here? With his trademark malevolent grin, he told us exactly what he is up to during an attention-seeking swing through Labour heartlands in the north of England where Reform is hoping to make hefty gains in the local elections. He cackled about “parking their tankson the lawns of the red wall”, a phrase he’s used before, but not previously with quite such an intensity of intent. The plan makes sense. If he is to advance on his stated ambition to be the next prime minister, it won’t be sufficient to get the better of the Tories in the scrap between the two of them for traditionally rightwing voters. He’s also going to need to garner support from at least some of the voters who backed Labour last July.The local elections on 1 May will be a first test of whether this strategy has viability. The outcome of these contests are awaited eagerly by Reform, nervily by Labour people anticipating a difficult night, and even more fretfully by the Tories, who are expecting an absolutely diabolical one. Kemi Badenoch is so desperate to depress expectations that she’s warned her party thatit could lose“almost every single one” of the more than 900 wards being defended by the Conservatives. Sir Keir Starmer’s party has many fewer seats to lose, but much to fear if there’s evidence that Farageism has the potential to wreck Labour at the next general election as grievously as it hurt the Conservatives at last year’s one.Reform is a vehicle for the angry to express their discontent with the quality of their lives and local areasWith both an unpopular government and a floundering official opposition to go at, this is fertile territory for Reform, and the more so becausepolls suggestits vote share is up about 10 points since the general election. That said, the path towards polling day has been rocky for Reform’s leader. The fat cheque once rumoured to be on its way fromhis erstwhile “hero”Elon Musk has never materialised. The billionaire has since said Mr Farage “doesn’t have what it takes” and transferred his benedictions to Rupert Lowe, the MP for Great Yarmouth who is now sitting as an independent as a result of a ferociously ugly falling out between him and Mr Farage. Mr Lowe, a wealthy fellow with deep pockets, has just announced that he isgoing to suefor defamation because of allegations made about him by the Reform leader and his acolytes.The bromance with Donald Trump has been much vaunted, mainly by Mr Farage himself. That looks to be even more of an electoral liability since the US president ignited the trade war that has unleashed mayhem on global markets. Nige made like a submarine for a while. When he finally surfaced to break his radio silence, he wasforced to admitthat his buddy in the White House might have blundered just a little bit, putting it down to doing “too much too soon”.Many Labour people used to be rather complacent about Reform, thinking it to be mainly a menace to the Tories. Now Morgan McSweeney and other Labour strategists are treating it as a serious threat. Sir Keir has been taking the gloves off by calling the Reform leader a danger to the NHS and attacking him forpast fawningover Vladimir Putin. Then there is Mr Farage’s unfortunate habit of attracting the repulsive to his ranks. For all his boasts that the party has become much stricter in vetting the characters it allows to be its candidates, a string of them havehad to be ditchedfor making comments so repellent that even Mr Farage couldn’t dismiss them as banter.Disowned candidates, being a Trump tribute act and internecine warfare. That’s a cocktail you might expect to be toxic to a party’s popularity if the normal rules applied. But it doesn’t seem to be off-putting to Reform supporters. His well-honed talent is for exploiting grievance, and there’s a lot of that about. As Ukip and the Brexit party were before it, Reform is a vehicle for the angry to express their discontent with the quality of their lives and local areas, and to vent their animosity towards Tory and Labour parties that Reform’s leader is adept at painting as two failed faces of a dismal status quo. The tactics are ruthless, but the policies are vacant. He’spromising votersthat Reform mayors and councillors will implement a Musk-inspired “British form of Doge” to purge alleged inefficiencies and excesses in council spending, with diversity and equality programmes predictably topping the hitlist. The chainsaw may be coming to your city, county or town hall. Burning it all down Musk-style will not solve, it will deepen, the problems in the areas that Reform is targeting.The party’s national prospectus is no more plausible. He claims he’ll slash taxes, but starts waffling whenever asked how he would pay for it. Unfunded tax cuts are from the Liz Truss school of fiscal responsibility and economic management. None of which is likely to matter much on 1 May because for those attracted to Farageism, it is not, and never has been, about its credibility as a programme for government. He provides a spittoon for the angry voter to gob their fury into.The poison between him and Mr Lowe suppurated into public view when the other man madea mocking referenceto Reform being a “protest party led by the Messiah”. I’m not with him on the Messiah bit, but the first half is correct. It is precisely because Reform is a protest party that itought to do extremely wellat these elections. Polling suggests that big majorities of voters in the North and the Midlands agree that “Britain is broken” and heading in the wrong direction. For those who feel they were betrayed by the Tories and are now being let down by Labour, Reform offers a boot with which to inflict a kick in the ballots on both the older parties.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reform hopes to replicate the Lib Dems’ successful model of building a substantial base of councillors and using them as beachheads to go on to capture parliamentary seats in the same localities.He’s predicting a “turquoise wave” across the North and Midlands. Polling suggests Reform won’t just gain councillors, but also councils and possibly bag a mayoralty in Lincolnshire and another in East Yorkshire. The Runcorn and Helsby byelection, also on May day,ought to be winnableif Reform has as much momentum as Mr Farage claims. On paper, the Cheshire seat is the 16th safest in Labour’s possession, but the concept of “safe” seats has much less relevance these days when the political landscape is so volatile and fragmented. The circumstances that triggered this byelection – the former Labour MPassaulting a constituent– also work in Reform’s favour.Whatever he may claim, a victorious night for Nigel Farage won’t mean that he is marching on Downing Street. It will mean deeper existential angst in the ranks of the Conservative party and elevated anxiety among Labour people that they haven’t found an answer to the seething mass of grievances that he so cunningly and cynically exploits.Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the ObserverExplore more on these topicsOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Can it bring back the fun?Sun 20 Apr 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Apr 2025 04.05 EDTShareWhat makes good satire? The answer might vary depending on who you ask. What is more unifying, however, is what doesn’t. Most would agree it’s things like punching down, cheap jokes, obviousness or, worst of all, failing to actually be funny.We saw a unique combination of all of the above last weekend, when the American live sketch comedy showSaturday Night Live(SNL)attempted to parody the hit HBO seriesThe White Lotus, setting it among current White House staff. Alongside middling caricatures of Donald Trump and the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the pre-recorded skit portrayed the English actor Aimee Lou Wood, who has a gap between her teeth, and her character from the show, Chelsea, as uncharacteristically stupid, with bulging eyes and buck teeth.“I did find theSNLthing mean and unfunny,” Wood said in a series of Instagram stories responding to the sketch, which drew widespread ire before her criticism. “I am not thin skinned. I actually love being taken the piss out of when it’s clever and in good spirits … I don’t mind caricature – I understand that’s whatSNLis. But the rest of the skit was punching up and I/Chelsea was the only one punched down on.”This kind of foible is rare forSNL. (The show has since apologised to Wood.) But lazy, unfunny sketches have become the show’s new norm. Despite its popularity since 1975, when it was created by the American comedy legend Lorne Michaels,SNL’s reputation and relevance has begun to dwindle over the last decade. Which is why the news that there will be aBritish version of the showcoming out next year on Sky – titledSNL UK,with Michaels as executive producer – has drawn more scepticism than excitement.Details are thin, butSNL UKpromises to deliver whatSNLhas been for 50 years: a weekly show of new sketches, featuring an A-lister and musical guest each episode. Sky says the UK iteration will be presented by a “star-studded lineup of hosts” with a cast of “the funniest British comedians around”.Almost immediately after it began,SNLbecame synonymous with cutting-edge humour and provocative satire, embedding itself as a core part of the US cultural diet. It also became a springboard for some of the biggest names in the entertainment industry. Mike Myers, Will Ferrell, Eddie Murphy, Adam Sandler, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler: all got their start as writers and actors onSNL. It wasn’t just that you watched for the sake of the show itself, but to familiarise yourself with what you knew would be tomorrow’s big name talent.The jokes aren’t just ripped from social media – SNL’s writers and performers are already semi-famous TikTokersButSNLin the 2020s is struggling to maintain that cultural foothold. LikeThe White Lotusskit, the sketches have become predictable and tedious. It suffers from the same problems plaguing British panel shows: that many of its jokes are recycled from viral tweets, memes and TikToks most of its audience will already have encountered in the week, regurgitating them in a duller, more laborious form.The jokes aren’t just ripped from social media – increasingly,SNL’s writers and performers are already semi-famous TikTokers. This doesn’t have to be a bad thing, (arguably it’s good that there’s a way for talented people online to make it in the mainstream) but it has largely not translated into incisive comedy.In the last decade, there have been far fewer breakout stars from the show – the best case being Bowen Yang who, while successful, has hardly achieved A-list heights, hosting a popular podcast and playing a minor role as Ariana Grande’s sidekick inWicked.SNL’s ratings have been rocky since the rise of streaming in the 2010s, and have especially taken a hit since the pandemic. (The show’s 50th anniversary special in February – a five-year viewership high –fell several million viewers shortof its 40th anniversary episode in 2015.) Michaels’ legacy isn’t what it once was, either. In a recent book about his career by theNew Yorkerwriter Susan Morrison, former cast members spoke about Michaels’more mixed reputation backstage, and his questionable decisions in the past decade – such as his preference for “sweetness” rather than anger in sketches.The book featured one viral quote from the comedian andSNLalumnus Tim Robinson, after the show infamously agreed to let Donald Trump host during the 2016 presidential campaign, which has since been credited with normalising Trump’s hard-right policies in the mainstream.“Lorne has lost his fucking mind,” Robinson said at the time. Michaels’ billing on theSNL UKbrand is not the sign of success his name once conveyed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There have already beenseveral failed attemptsto reboot SNL in Britain, and in recent years transatlantic comedy remakes have been especially difficult to pull off. (The notoriousInbetweenersUS pilot is a good example of how humour does not always translate.)Not all have failed, of course:The Office USbecame one of the most beloved sitcoms of all time, proving you can adapt these formats for another country’s sensibilities. (It’s worth noting, though, that the successes tend to be US remakes of British shows rather than the other way around.) But a saccharine sketch show – which relies heavily on the much smaller pool of famous British hosts to draw in viewers, produced by a man now in his 80s – doesn’t feel like an especially reliable vehicle for zeitgeist-shifting British humour in 2025.The retro quaintness ofSNL UKcould be pitched as part of its appeal – providing appointment TV that serves as a refreshing antidote to algorithms and streaming.But it’s more likely to feel like a sign of our age where, rather than rolling the dice on something exciting and new, studios give us reboot after reboot of tried and tested material that they know “works” (ie, is commercially successful), which they presume audiences will love.It may be thatSNL UKpulls off all the hallmarks ofSNL: famous faces, a varied cast and a multimillion weekly viewership. But we have come to learn that this doesn’t mean it will move the culture, make good satire, or that it will manage to be funny.Sarah Manavis is a US writer and critic living in the UKExplore more on these topicsSaturday Night LiveOpinionTV comedyTelevisionComedycommentShareReuse this content"

That’s all we wantedSonia SodhaLast week’s ruling clarified the legal safeguards of the Equality Act. However, it was a travesty that the battle needed to be fought at allSun 20 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Apr 2025 03.19 EDTShareMiddle-aged women are expected to fade into the background, to be apologetic for their existence, to quietly accept their lot. They’re not supposed to stick up for themselves, to enforce their boundaries, to say no. As a woman, these societal expectations have been drummed into me from day one. But still. The swell of anger and disgust that rose in response to thesupreme court judgmentlast week that made clear women’s rights are not for dismantling – rights already won, that were supposed to be ours all along – has taken my breath away.I was in court last Wednesday to hear Lord Hodge confirm that the Equality Act’s legal protections that were always intended for women are, indeed, reserved for women. He reiterated that trans people continue to have the same robust legal protections against discrimination and harassment as any other protected group, something I’ve always emphasised in my own writing. But men who identify as female – whether or not they have a legal certificate – are not to be treated as though female for the purposes of equalities law.This is a hugely consequential clarification because for the past 10 years lobby groupssuch as Stonewallhave misrepresented the law, telling public sector organisations, charities and companies that they must treat trans women as women.Now the supreme courthas made it clear: female-only services, spaces and sports cannot admit males, however they identify. Workplaces and schools must offer single-sex facilities; service providers do not always have to, though it may be unlawful sex discrimination for them not to do so.This means it is never lawful to expect a female nurse to share changing facilities with a male colleague. It’s not lawful to tell a distressed female patient that the obviously male patient next to her in the female-only ward is, in fact, a woman and she is transphobic to question it. It’s not lawful to expect a female rape victim to take or leave a female-only support group that includes men. It’s not lawful to tell a woman required to undergo a strip-search that the male police officer doing it is actually female. It’s not lawful to expect teenage girls to play women’s football on a team with male players, or female boxers to box against men. Lesbians can have their own groups and associations without being bullied into admitting straight male members who – in an act of gross homophobia – self-identify as “lesbian”.Why does this matter? Because this unlawful activity has all been happening in recent years, to the detriment not just of women’s safety, but our privacy and dignity. The judgment could not be clearer on the above, though that has not stopped a former supreme court justice,Jonathan Sumption, and a former cabinet minister,Harriet Harman, from taking to the airwaves to interpret the law incorrectly.Can you imagine angry leftwing men railing against any other group that’s managed to secure their rights? Me neitherIn his remarks, Hodge cautioned against readingthe judgmentas a triumph of one group over another. That is entirely correct: the Equality Act balances conflicting rights, and the supreme court has simply restored the balance to where the law said it was supposed to be. Trans people have their protections, but now women’s protections, too, have been clearly ringfenced on the same basis – all that leftwing feminists ever asked for.But many pundits have misinterpreted this as meaning women should not celebrate a landmark legal victory in a case it was a travesty they ever had to fight. It’s a product of the rank misogyny embedded everywhere, from right to left. Can you imagine angry leftwing men railing against any other group that’s managed to secure their rights? Chastising them for not being gracious enough in victory? Me neither. The reaction to the judgment serves as an important reminder that, while the law is the law, our culture remains dead-set against women who say no to men. It’s how women’s and lesbians’ rights were so rapidly eroded by Stonewall and its allies in the first place, and why women have been bullied, hounded and sacked simply for trying to assert their legal protections.The same people are ignoring the supreme court’s emphasis that none of this takes away from trans people’s existing rights, and are scaremongering and infantilising trans people as victims. Lloyds Bank wrote to all its employees to say it “stood by” and “cherished”all its trans employees. Several unions have organised an emergency demo in support of trans rights, giving the impression they are beingrolled back. It’s easy to forget that all that has happened is that the supreme court has been clear that a male desire for validation does not trump women’s rights to single-sex spaces and services. That if you are a male police officer or nurse demanding to strip-search or carry out a smear test on a woman, the answer is no. Part of being a grownup is understanding that the world cannot always be structured around your own wants and needs. It’s not kind, compassionate or healthy to indulge a failure to accept that.The judgment means trans rights activists are at a crossroads. Do they double down and try to argue that MPs must respond by dismantling women’s legal protections? Or do they put a stop to an ideological crusade that’s harmed not just women and lesbians, but the many trans people who aren’t dogmatic about gender ideology, and instead advocate for gender-neutral third spaces, open and female categories in sports, and specialist services for trans people, and against discrimination based on gender non-conformity? If they pick the latter path, they’ll find willing allies in women like me.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He takes us back nearly 50 years to British glaciologist John Mercer’s warning that continued use of fossil fuel could lead to a 2C temperature rise by the mid-21st century threatening, among other potential catastrophes, a 5m sea level rise.His warnings, since echoed by swelling numbers of scientists, point out that climate change “threatens to displace hundreds of millions of people from their homelands”. Tragically, McKie reports, “large parts of society turn their heads and deliberately reject the truths that have been presented to them”. Our increasingly busy roads and airports illustrate this. His article needs to be read by government ministers, reported widely in the press and studied in schools.Richard VernonOxfordEverything on Earth is thermally driven, the warmer it gets the more dangerously active it becomes. So it is vital that we keep Earth’s temperature within safe limits. In addition to net zero greenhouse gas emissions, we must achieve zero waste if we are to avoid rendering our planet home unsustainable. In terms of Earth, we are a dangerous species, so we are going to need all our philosophical wisdom and our best scientific achievement if we are to hang around much longer.John StoneThames Ditton, SurreyThis bill is a humane reformI have great respect for Sonia Sodha, so I took her notes of caution about the proposed assisted dying legislation seriously (“In the rush towards a law on assisted dying, the vulnerable have become expendable”, Comment).My beloved partner of 40 years, Bob, died almost five years ago of cancer. He had the “decent end of life care” that Sonia argues should be the gold standard: he had palliative care from hospitals, district and Macmillan nurses. Nevertheless, he suffered greatly towards the end: medicine can’t always magic pain away, whatever the palliative care teams promise. He also hated the inevitable loss of dignity in his last few weeks.I helped to provide the loving care until his last day, which, as Sodha rightly acknowledges, is a privilege that many relatives and friends cherish. But the dying have rights too and their wishes, should they want to shorten that period of their suffering, deserve respect and should be paramount. This bill is for Bob – who didn’t have the option of assisted dying – and one day, perhaps for me too. Yes, there have been safeguarding failures and NHS scandals. The challenge is to work to prevent repeats of those, to strengthen the bill and not to abandon this important opportunity for humane reform.Jane DrinkwaterDidsbury, ManchesterSonia Sodha issues a timely warning of the consequences of ignoring concerns about Kim Leadbeater’s bill, proposing state-endorsed suicide. Over 2,000 years ago Aristotle posed a question: “Who is harmed by suicide?” Society’s care of the terminally ill reflects our deepest shared sense of humanity. The humane answer to Aristotle’s question is that we are all diminished by a person’s suicide.Dr David JeffreyWest Malvern, WorcestershireWhy resurrect the extinct?Martha Gill must have been eavesdropping in the offices of every conservation organisation around the world (“Why resurrect the dire wolf when existing animals are facing extinction?”, Comment). Colleagues and I at Fauna & Flora were reeling at Colossal Biosciences’ colossal investment into the claimed de-extinction of the dire wolf.Pouring millions into de-extinction is like starting to build a new home rather than calling for the fire brigade when your house is on fire. If we have any hope of saving this failing planet, we need to focus on the now and next – protecting real species, in real places, before they too become long lost mythical creatures.Kristian TelekiFauna & Flora, CambridgeThat sinking feelingOne aspect of Jeff Bezos’ wedding not mentioned by Catherine Bennett is that Venice is sinking, and that its sinking is partly linked to Bezos: the carbon emissions of Amazon and pointless trips into space (“No union and forget staff toilet breaks, but hey, at least Bezos can buy Venice for his wedding”, Comment). Is Bezos trying to rub it in that he can buy Venice for his party while simultaneously destroying it?Michelle WilsonLa Pera, Catalonia, SpainRainbows by moonlightIn her solution to Guess the Painting, Laura Cumming describes the phenomenon in Caspar David Friedrich’s paintingMountain Landscape with Rainbow, as “a rainbow somehow occurring by moonlight” (New Review, print only). But this was most likely not just in his imagination. About 10 years ago, we were astonished to see a “moon bow” in Derbyshire: as the full moon rose and shone at a low angle into the rain over the top of Padley Gorge, a silver bow appeared across Hope Valley. When I googled it, I found “moon bows” were rare but most often witnessed in Hawaii.Cora GreenhillGrindleford, DerbyshireSteel is a shared resourceYour leader examines the security concerns of primary steel making capacity (“British Steel is saved for now, but for how long?”). After the Second World War, production was seen in terms of shared, rather than national, sovereignty in the shape of the European Coal and Steel Community. Similarly, because of the war in Ukraine, increasingly prosecuted through European defence cooperation, a European energy and steel union could be founded.John F KingYorkRhyme of the timesI very much enjoyed William Keegan’s article last Sunday, especially the witty clerihew provided by Martin Bell (“After this, what more proof does Britain need that it can’t ‘cosy up’ to Trump?”, Business & Cash).

As the much-anticipated second season begins, they discuss growing up in the glare of fameSun 20 Apr 2025 03.01 EDTShareBella Ramsey self-recorded their audition tape forThe Last of Usat their parents’ home in Leicestershire and sent it off more in hope than expectation. Ramsey, who was 17 at the time, had never played the post-apocalyptic zombie video game on which the new TV series was based, but knew it was a big deal: released in 2013, it had sold more than 20m copies. It would later emerge that Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann, the show’s creators, looked seriously at more than 100 actors for the role of Ellie, the sassy and quirky but also complicated and vicious American protagonist ofThe Last of Us. “Yeah, I’ve been told,” says Ramsey with a wry smile.When Ramsey got the first callback from Mazin and Druckmann, they joined the Zoom from their childhood bedroom. “I’ve gotten very used to sending in a self-tape and forgetting about it,” they say, when we meet at a photo studio in north London. “But the problem was when there was a self-tape that really meant something to me, likeThe Last of Usdid. It feels quite scary. And when I got the phone call saying they wanted me to be Ellie it did feel surreal for a few days. I understood that if I said yes – which obviously I was going to – my life was going to change.”Life-changing is one way to describe it. Ramsey was hardly inexperienced when they were cast: their professional debut was aged 11 as the no-nonsense Lyanna Mormont inGame of Thrones; they had also been the star of the CBBC seriesThe Worst Witchand appeared in the BBC/HBO adaptation ofHis Dark Materials. ButThe Last of Uswas something else. About 40 million people watched the first episode in 2023 and the series, which is said to have cost $100m, became the most popular HBO show ever in Europe. Brutally violent at times, but also tender and poignant, the odd-couple chemistry between Ramsey’s Ellie and Pedro Pascal’s Joel has attracted an obsessive fanbase far beyond video-game nerds.I go out in my joggers, I go out in my ripped T-shirt that needs a wash. I’m sort of in denial about itRamsey, who has an uncompromising centre-parting, dark, doll-like eyes and bow lips, has in turn had to sacrifice a quiet life living with their folks in the Midlands. When their casting was announced, there was immediate and persistent criticism from fans of the video game that Ramsey didn’t look enough like Ellie. Ramsey, new to the attention and curious, sought out all the most hurtful comments. Then, during promotion for the series, Ramsey came out as nonbinary and said that the they/them pronouns were “the most truthful to me”. This generated more attention – perhaps more than was helpful for a teenager, they concede – and again became a hot topic with trolls already furious at the inclusion of LGBTQ characters in the games.Thankfully when the show aired, both it and Ramsey were manifestly excellent, and everyone moved on. “What makes Ellie so fascinating is that she has a lot of the fear and exuberance of a child, but also this strange, sad, heavy, beautiful wisdom and violence,” Mazin, the co-creator and co-writer, has said. “What you’re waiting for [in casting] is the person that makes it undeniable, where you’re like, ‘Oh, we’re done. Everything’s OK.’ And that was Bella.”View image in fullscreenRamsey and Pedro Pascal in a scene from The Last of Us season one.Photograph: APBut here we are again with season two. The first series followed Ellie and Joel as they travelled across an America infested with zombies; Ellie is immune to the Cordyceps fungus that causes the zombifying infection, and the suspicion is that she could be humanity’s saviour. But the season ended on a cliffhanger – spoiler alert! – with a lie Joel told Ellie that saved her anguish but maybe compromised the rest of the planet. Season two promises to reveal if Joel gets found out.Still, Ramsey has changed their mind on one aspect of the process: it doesn’t have to be life-changing after all. “With the release of season two, I’ve realised that there is a large element of it that’s out of my control – but a large element of it also is. Yeah, I’ve been still getting the tube. And just walking around. My day-to-day life hasn’t changed. I go out in my joggers, I go out in my ripped T-shirt that needs a wash. I’m sort of in denial about it. Or can’t comprehend it so just carry on as if nothing’s happened.”Do people think, I wonder, “That can’t beBella Ramsey, they’ve got a dirty T-shirt on”? They adopt a fashion pose: “Darling, I only go out in Prada.” (Today, for what it’s worth, Ramsey wears joggers, a blue sweatshirt, which appears to be freshly laundered, and trainers, all Adidas.)That could be a classic actor flex – “I still take the tube,” says the A-lister who last used public transport in 2004 – but you believe Ramsey. They come across as a funny and self-deprecating but basically pretty normal 21-year-old who happens to have landed on the biggest show on TV. “What I’ve realised is that you reach that level of fame for a few months, then people move on to the next thing, the next show. Now going into season two, I’m aware that it’s going to hype back up. I’m going to be more recognisable, people are going to want to talk to me a bit more for a couple of months. Then it’ll just die down again…”Ramsey pauses, lets out a long breath, perhaps a sigh, “Which is a really, really big relief.”It’s hard to believe, seeing that they have been doing it professionally for half their life, but Ramsey insists that they never set out to be an actor. Their parents were not in the industry, but dabbled in am-dram, and when Ramsey was four they joined their older sister in a local drama club, Stagecoach, in Loughborough. Their highlights reel from those days would have included roles as a monkey, a spoilt American brat and, in a breakthrough performance aged eight, the back half of a cow (their sister, pulling sibling rank, was the front) inJack and the Beanstalk. But aged 10, Ramsey applied to the Television Workshop, a drama group in Nottingham that helped to bring through Samantha Morton, Felicity Jones and Jack O’Connell. From there, they auditioned forGame of Thrones.View image in fullscreenAs Lyanna Mormont in Game of Thrones.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyWasn’t Ramsey nervous when they were cast? “Not nervous, because I hadn’t built it up in my head. Really, I’d never known that I’d wanted to be an actor. It wasn’t like this thing that I’d been dreaming of all my life.”On the set ofGame of Thrones, though, Ramsey loved it. They had struggled to make friends as a child; now, in adult company, something clicked. “It felt very natural. Immediately it felt like a place where I belonged, which I’d never felt anywhere else in my life, not at school, not in any of the millions of clubs I was a part of.”A much bigger deal for Ramsey was landing the lead, Mildred Hubble, inThe Worst Witch, which aired in 2017. “Because I watched CBBC,” they explain, “so I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, this is it.’” Ramsey was in the show for three seasons, shooting for 16 weeks each summer in Cheshire. Chaperones were not allowed, so Ramsey was away on her own, without a parent, Monday to Friday. “I was quite anxious as a kid anyway, and I was away from home for the first time,” they say. “I didn’t even go on a residential school trip before, because I didn’t want to be away from home.”At the end of the first season, Ramsey developed anorexia. They think now that it was down, in large part, to the stress of feeling that they had to set an example to the cast and crew. “Leading a show, you have the responsibility of that on your shoulders. There is a maturity that’s required of you that thankfully came quite naturally to me, but it’s just… it’s hard. It’s just hard.”Ramsey recovered from the anorexia with counselling, and those experiences have inspired them to write a film script, Toast and Jam (the title comes from what they ate each night to help them recover from the illness). The screenplay is about a 14-year-old girl with an eating disorder and Ramsey wants to direct it. “It’s finished,” they giggle. “I’ve finished it so many times, but now it’s finished-finished, ready-to-be-sent-out finished.”Talking to Ramsey, there’s a sense that they have experienced a lot,been througha lot, for someone so young. They agree: “There is now an element of me looking back and being like, ‘Oh, I was never a teenager.’ I do feel like I went from kid to adult. I had to show up on set every day and be responsible and have this very adult job.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s certainly a wild ride’: Ramsey, left, and Isabela Merced in the second season of The Last of Us.Photograph: HBOIt is perhaps not surprising that Ramsey has always found adult company easier than people their own age. But they have left home now and moved into a flat in London, so that is something they are working on. “Because I’ve grown up a lot with people much older than me, that is the dynamic that I’m really comfortable in and really good at,” says Ramsey. “Now, living in London, I’ve got a small group of friends who are my age – for the first time, really. That’s been a really, really positive thing of letting go of the shy, loner kid inside of me. Honouring that part of me, but also being, ‘No, I can get along with people my age! And I do like hanging out with you, and you like hanging out with me, which is maybe even crazier.’”Something that has bolstered Ramsey in recent times is being diagnosed as neurodiverse. The process started in January 2023, when they were shooting the first season ofThe Last of Us. “Someone on set just assumed that I was autistic,” they recall. “They had a kid who was and were like, ‘You are, right?’ And I was like, ‘Whoa!’ I’ve always thought that maybe I was, but I thought I’d sort of been making it up. Then I went through the whole diagnostic process. And it turns out I am, which has been so helpful for me. Like, every day.”I never had the experience as a kid of friendly fighting with friends so it felt like I was living a childhood dreamNeurodiversity also helps to explain why Ramsey has been drawn to acting. They are certainly not a method actor; their approach is much looser. In 2022, they starred in the Lena Dunham-directed filmCatherine Called Birdy, about a headstrong 14-year-old girl in 13th-century Lincolnshire. “I learned about the 1200s, but really specific things,” they say. “Like what everyday life was like, what it would be like to be a peasant. I don’t really know the big events that happened. My prep for everything is just to make it feel like I’m not acting really. Make it feel like I’m immersed in this world, and I’d know what I’d be doing at lunchtime or stuff.”For Dunham, Ramsey’s versatility gives them the ability to play almost anything. “Bella reminds me of Tilda Swinton inOrlando,” the director toldVogue, which featured Ramsey on the April cover. “[They have] that ability to shapeshift and become new in front of your very eyes. They have a quality that is both modern and totally timeless. They’d fit as easily at a rave in Dalston as in a Renaissance court.”Because of not going to school during her teenage years – Ramsey studied online at King’s InterHigh and has followed it up with courses on environmental science from the Open University – they accept they have some gaps in their knowledge. Instead, acting has bestowed them with more esoteric talents such as horse-riding and broadsword fighting. “Medieval skills,” Ramsey says. “You never know when the medieval times are going to come again. And when they do, I’ll be ready.”Nothing quite so left field was required for the new season ofThe Last of Us. Ramsey did a lot of physical training and Brazilian jujitsu sessions to make it convincing that someone 5ft 1in could fend off hordes of snarling zombies. “You are always sore,” they say. “But it was a really nice thing for me to do grappling and fighting. Because I never had the experience as a kid of friendly fighting with friends. So it felt like I was living a childhood dream.”View image in fullscreenPortrait by David Vintiner.Ramsey is intensely proud of the new series. “The second season, there was definitely an expectation and pressure to live up to the first one,” they say. “But everyone’s goal was not to live up to it, but to surpass it. And I feel pretty confident in the fact that people are going to be really happy.” Ramsey stops, and seems to scroll through how the episodes unfold. “Well, I wouldn’t say happy, actually. More just emotionally traumatised and shocked. It’s certainly a wild ride.”A main thread in the new season is Ellie’s relationship with Dina, played by Isabela Merced.The Last of Usis a progressive show – there are gay characters, and this series introduces Lev, a trans teenager – and Ramsey believes that can have a powerful impact in introducing a mainstream audience to queer storylines. “On set, there’s no having to hide or feel like you’re out of place,” they say. “Everyone feels like they belong working on the show, and hopefully as a viewer as well.”How does Ramsey feel about their decision to come out as non-binary? “Part of me looks back and I wish that I didn’t, because I didn’t want it to become a headline and a big thing,” they say. “And obviously it was going to, and I didn’t really understand that at the time. And I wasn’t really prepared for that. But on the other hand, people have said to me that it’s been very helpful for them seeing some representation.“So it’s been a mixed bag, but overall, I think it was a good thing, just for me living more freely, without feeling like I’m keeping a secret,” Ramsey goes on. “But now I’m like, ‘I’ll talk about it, but I don’t want it to be the focus any more.’ I guess I’m just quite chill with it. And I want everyone else to be as chill with it basically.”The Last of Us review – one of the finest TV shows you will see this yearRead moreRamsey seems to be in a good place; not long before we meet they deactivated their Instagram account. Part of the inspiration was the actor and director Jesse Eisenberg, whom Ramsey worked with on the 2020 war dramaResistance, and Kit Harington fromGame of Thrones. “Those are the two actors who I just thought were the coolest people to ever walk the earth, and neither of them had social media,” Ramsey says. “I remember them just being so normal and funny and interesting. They were famous because they were great at something, not because they were celebrities. They never pushed themselves out there and made themselves more famous.”Watch a trailer for season two of The Last of Us.Ramsey had never planned to have a social-media presence: they started their Instagram account initially because there were fake accounts pretending to be them. “The problem was that I did sort of enjoy it,” Ramsey admits, with a grin. “I’m so susceptible to the dopamine hits of scrolling, I’d lose sleep just scrolling on Instagram. And I didn’t need that in my life any more.”As for the future, a third season ofThe Last of Ushas already been announced. They want to write, direct, but really, seeing as they are still only 21, anything feels possible. Mainly, though, they want to keep acting, exploring their limits there. “If I passed away on a film set, I’d be happy,” says Ramsey, as we part. “I would like to be acting until my last breath, for sure.”The Last of Usis on Sky Atlantic and NowExplore more on these topicsBella RamseyThe ObserverThe Last of UsGame of ThronesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As she investigated the phenomenon, one of her first steps was to spend a week on a working retreat on Iona. And then something strange happened…Lamorna AshSun 20 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTShareIt started in the most earthbound, airless way. I was at my desk in a bedroom overlooking the hardscrabble surrounds of Harringay station in north London. It was early 2021, so there was nowhere else to be. All I wanted was something to write about. In my notebook were four ideas for potential essays and three of them were non-starters. The other was a piece of gossip. A comedy double act from my university days had simultaneously converted toChristianity. More: they both wanted to become priests. Comedians to Anglican priests. That was something. I sent an email, asking if I could interview them.My interviews with the two recent converts took place over the course of a year. Do you believe in the resurrection? I asked them. In heaven? Where do you stand on demons? But what I saw of the two young men’s faith, finally, was not through their answers to my generic questions about Christianity. It was reflected in their faces and enacted in their gestures as I attended religious services beside them.The first time I recognised this, it disturbed me: the fact that faith might so alter a person’s life they would have to leave behind all those outside its perimeters. I knew I could never let it happen to me. But by the timemy essaywas published [in theGuardian] in late 2022, I knew I was not finished with Christianity. I say it scared me to witness how their conversions redefined the territories of their lives. But I also found it astonishing: the way a conversion arrives like a volta in a person’s life, an act simultaneously as destructive and constructive as falling in love, because, ultimately, it is a sacramental kind of falling in love.Perhaps it was naive not to have anticipated how spending my days alongside two fresh converts, attending services with them, speaking with them for hours about their faith, would have some cumulative effect on me. Through those encounters, it was as if the very corner of the sky had been pulled back.I decided to seek out Christians who had taken as many distinct routes into and occasionally out of faith as possible. But I also had another question turning in the back of my mind: Could anyone be converted to a religion? If I kept putting myself in the way of Christianity, would I eventually be converted? I framed this as a joke aspect of my research at first. “Could I become a Christian in a year?” But I’m not sure how much I was ever really joking.View image in fullscreenA view of Iona, which Lamorna Ash visited for a working retreat.Photograph: Courtesy of Lamorna AshFor my perpetual Christian road-trip – beginning in the last months of 2022 and ending in early 2024 – I purchased a 21 year-old Toyota Corollaand stocked the glove box with second-hand CDs. I filled up my calendar with Christian retreats, church visits and stays in the houses of Christian strangers all across the highways and byways of the UK – Cornwall, Sussex, Kent, Hertfordshire, Birmingham, north Wales, Norfolk, Sheffield, Halifax, Durham, the Inner Hebrides – seeking out every kind of Christian, from Catholics to Orthodox Christians: Quakers, Pentecostals, Evangelicals, high to low Anglicans, Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, self-professed mystics, focusing on my generation specifically, those in their 20s and 30s, the youngest set of adults in Britain.Very quickly, I discovered the two young comedians were not outliers when it comes to my generation’s relationship to faith in Britain. Not only did I meet a host of people in their 20s and 30s who have converted to some form of Christianity, but I also detected a marked attitudinal shift in how my peers talk about religion compared with the generations that came before us.We are leagues away from the New Atheist movement of the 1990s, which repudiated religion on supposedly intellectual grounds – though the straw-man version of religion Richard Dawkins and his ilk chose to burn down was the most pallid, simplistic form they could devise. Our feelings about faith are distinct, too, from the broad strokes of apathy or indifference towards belief that often characterised the 2000s.The conversations about faith I have with friends and acquaintances are characterised by increased tolerance and openness to religious frames of mind. This, I think, speaks to the kind of world in which we have come of age. We were born into a period of extended contingency, of greater diversity and plurality, in terms of beliefs and backgrounds and sexualities, of great financial instability, under austerity measures, our futures shadowed by the now unavoidable fact of planetary climate collapse. We were the first generation to have had smartphones and social media intervene into our childhoods, half of our daily interactions now carried out via fragmented chats across various platforms run by tech billionaires. Social media both makes the rest of the world more in reach and also leaves us feeling ever more atomised, craving the kind of physical community we might have once gotten through the mosque, the synagogue, the temple, the church.The global pandemic was a silent player in many of the conversions or revolutions in belief of those I interviewed. Research into the relationship between faith and the pandemic is just now appearing. Between March 2020 and March 2021, the Church of England’s various prayer apps were accessed 8m times, a 50% increase on the previous year. During the pandemic, Google searches for prayer rose by 30% – reaching the highest numbers ever recorded across all continents.There’s a paper that suggests that those in the UK with religious beliefs weathered the pandemic more easily than those without faith. During the lockdowns more people in the UK grew depressed, but the statistics for those who suffered depression were 29% lower among those who identified with a religion. The pandemic also offered an interlude during which many people could question whether there might be other ways to live. If not for the lockdowns, the young comedians would not have had the chance to take a pause from their careers and study Christianity. If not for all those months confined to my flat, staring at the walls, I wonder whether Christianity would have taken root in my imagination the way it has.My initial encounters with Christianity during my travels felt transitory and unsolid. I would spend three days living with a charismatic Christian community in Hertfordshire and then return home to wonder if it had really happened. Some of those I interviewed suggested I try a couple of Christian retreats. “Take some time out from the interferences of your ordinary life,” they said. Christ needed his period in the wilderness; I needed some desert time. So I set off on three Christian retreats, the first on the Scottish island of Iona.View image in fullscreen‘They say you go to Iona when your life is in transition.’ A view from the island.Photograph: Courtesy of Lamorna AshI was sick during the journey up there, my third round of flu in as many months. Around that time I couldn’t work out how to stay as one version of myself, my mood flipping between a depressive and manic character several times a week. A sprint followed by a crash, on loop, ad nauseam. To make matters worse, I was also heartsick. Unrequited love, the lamest of all love’s related ailments.I remember almost nothing from the train ride to Edinburgh, nor the one from Edinburgh to Glasgow, nor the ferry to the island of Mull, just burning through tissues and squinting at field after field of sun-stung snow, the sky above very blue.At Fionnphort waiting room, from where the ferry to Iona departs, I left a half-empty packet of cigarettes on a chair for someone else, vowing I would come back changed, in this small way at least.They say you go to Iona when your life is in transition. The 3 by 1.5-mile island is a holy site because it was the first point of contact between Scotland and Christianity. In 563, the Irish saint Columba rowed the religion across the seas from Ballycastle in Northern Ireland to Iona on a wicker currach, 12 men with him. The Iona Community is ecumenical, non-denominational, its several hundred members and several thousand young associates united instead by their shared values, which are consolidated in their four rules of life: daily prayer and engagement with the Bible; working for justice and peace, wholeness and reconciliation in their localities, society, and creation; supporting one another in the community through prayer and meeting; sharing in the life and organisation of the community.The Iona Community runs retreats most of the year in the abbey.Before the new season begins, they host a work week to prepare the abbey and its grounds for all the visitors. I had chosen the work week because it was cheaper than the other retreats, and because I liked the idea of being around for the start of something. Many of those I met come for the work week every year. Most were Christian in one form or another. Some were ordained. Lots of them were retired.There are two worship services daily in the abbey’s medieval church. After a quiet dinner the first night, we passed in total darkness through the cloisters. We had been told to wrap up, the church being only marginally warmer than the outside, most of its masonry completed in the 13th century. Sitting close together in the choir between the nave and altar, we rubbed our gloved hands together and watched as our breath came out in streams as we read in one voice from the Iona Abbey worship book. .View image in fullscreenA view of the abbey on Iona.Photograph: Courtesy of Lamorna AshHigh above the altar, around a great tracery window, ferns sprouted through gaps in the dark pink and grey stonework. No one knows how they got there, growing from the inside like that. The wind cried through the gaps all service long. The wild geese called overhead. There in the pews, under candlelight, I started to cry. I was so tired. I was so relieved to have made it here, to be away from my life, among strangers. Perhaps it was the simplicity of the Iona prayers, perhaps it was something about the old stone and the ancient winds passing through the church, but I cried almost every service. Could you call that faith, the letting-go of reason, a momentary burning of the heart?After the service, we looked out through the cloisters at the innumerable plots of stars above the abbey and I cried some more. “This place gets called the Thin Place,” someone told me. Here the membrane dividing heaven from Earth, the celestial ozone, is narrower than the usual three feet, as the old Celtic saying has it.All week I was in the gardening team. We knelt in the wet grass tugging out the weeds that had been smothering the raspberry bushes over the winter. One of the pastors working for the Iona Community told us to stop when we could in our work, to try to discover where God was in what we were doing. Now and then someone beside me would surface from their work, standing amazed as they stared over at the sea.Tell me before all this started that some day I would gladly attend two church services daily, and I will say you are mad. On Iona I longed for our hours in the church like a hunger. The words in the prayer book felt to me like escape valves. Each verse we spoke in chorus, it was as if some new guilt or hurt was released from my body. I’d found a language for faith that I could let in. For the first time in a long while, I noticed I was having only one thought at a time. A few days in, I was not sick any more, my mood even and content.My last night on Iona, a pastor from Oregon asked if I would read from the pulpit during the evening service. It was the first time I’d spoken in a church service. I read with as much feeling as I could muster: this was the world now, and I wanted to be fully in it. As far as he might run, the psalmist declares, his God always remains close by him; as much as he cloaks himself in darkness, his God will see the light in him.On the altar at the back of the church there was a polished silver St John’s Cross. And though there was no light source anywhere near it that final night, the St John’s Cross shone regardless. There was illumination when none should have been, a light made out of the darkness.View image in fullscreen‘I feel so different from the person I was’. Ash bought a cross soon after her visit.Photograph: Courtesy of Lamorna AshAfter the service, we all came out to stand in the abbey gardens where we’d spent the week pulling weeds and planting herbs. It was so dark we could make out the dusty meshwork of stars behind stars. The head gardener pointed up into the sky, directing us to the bright stars that make up Orion: Betelgeuse, Rigel, Saiph, Bellatrix. A satellite floated by, and we felt the size of the space between us and the machines orbiting our Earth. I looked up at the sky over the Thin Place. I thought about my home, the city. I wondered if it was possible to live there as if it were a sacred place, too.Back in Oban I went to a jewellery shop and bought a cross. Cheap, silver-plated, thumbnail-sized, worn on a thin link chain, a replica of the St John’s Cross. As soon as it was mine, I wanted the cross on me, found myself ripping open the brown paper and struggling with the clasp right there out in the cold on a street overlooking a grey sea. The rest of the way home, I kept reaching to touch it at my breastplate. As we were leaving the island, we were told: “You’ll see: You’ll take part of this place on with you.” I really wanted that to be true, for a week of peace and structured living to have shaken me out of my old ways. I wanted my cross to signify this. Stand for some internal change. Proclaim it to others externally. There was so much I needed this cross to do.Two years (and innumerable conversations and church visits with Christians from all across the religious spectrum) later, I feel so different from the person I was when I started this research. I have this courage now that did not previously exist. I still don’t think I could tell you anything definitive and absolute about the Christian faith, nor my own relationship with it – but what a trip it has been. I haven’t found any answers. I’ll go on looking.This is an edited extract fromDon’t Forget We’re Here Forever: A New Generation’s Search for Religionby Lamorna Ash (Bloomsbury, £22).

He studied law at Cambridge but took a year out to care for his mother, who died of colon cancer aged 45. Weeks after her death, he successfully auditioned for Rada and went on to become a stage actor. His TV breakthrough came inAdrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years. He has since starred inGreen Wing,EpisodesandThe Split. He co-hostsLandscapeandPortrait Artistof the Yearon Sky Arts, and aweekly show on Classic FM. He is currently appearing in throuple comedyUnicornin the West End and is the author of six bestselling children’s books.His seventhis out in May.Your sister Anita illustrates your books. What’s it like working with a sibling?Great fun. Essentially we’re trying to make each other laugh, like we have done since childhood. But because I’m her annoying older brother, I deliberately put things in the book that are difficult to draw.Do you use yourthree sonsas a focus group?I use my 14-year-old as a plot consultant. If I’ve painted myself into a corner, I’ll have a chat with Frank. He’s very good at talking me through my logical inconsistencies. Then Jack, who’s now nine, reads a draft while I try not to be the person going: “What were you laughing at there? Why aren’t you laughing at this bit?”What things do you need to write?A lot of food and coffee. I come up to my office with a tray full of coffee, nuts and apples. Then I try not to stare out of the window, while eating like a demented squirrel. Acting is a team sport whereas writing is solitary, so it’s nice to yo-yo between the two.View image in fullscreenMangan with Annabel Scholey in The Split.Photograph: BBC/Sister PicturesYou’re approaching the end of your West End run inMike Bartlett’sUnicorn. Have you enjoyed it?I’ve loved it. It’s a play full of good ideas and great lines. Also Erin [Doherty] and Nicola [Walker, his co-stars] are two of the very best. They’re both so present on stage. Sometimes you work with actors who’ve worked out their performance in their bathroom at home and are going to give that performance come hell or high water. What’s lovely is that we all listen to one another and every night is genuinely very different. It’s great that a new play has done so well in the West End. And it feels absolutely contemporary.With three people in a bed, who goes in the middle? What happens if you have to get up to go to the loo?What’s been the audience reaction? Has it started conversations or inspired any “throuples”?We do get standing ovations at the end but we also get people leaving after 10 minutes because they weren’t expecting that nice couple fromThe Splitto be telling each other what they want to do in bed. I know people who’ve had uncomfortable taxi rides home afterwards. We’ve had throuples come to talk to us at the stage door. The other day, we had a bloke and two women who’d been together for 40 years. We’ve had three women who’d been together 20 years. In a way, I’ve got more questions for them than they have for me. You just want to know how it works. Even sleeping arrangements. With three people in a bed, who goes in the middle? What happens if you have to get up to go to the loo?Have you seenErin Doherty inAdolescence?I’ve put it off because we’re doing this play together and it would feel weird. As soon asUnicorn’s run finishes this week, I’ll sit down and watch it. Partly because Erin’s in it and Stephen Graham, who’s fantastic. But also because I’ve got three boys and I think it’s an important thing to watch.Who do you get more recognised as nowadays –Dan Moody fromI’m Alan Partridgeor Guy Secretan fromGreen Wing?I still get “Dan!” shouted at me several times per week. It tends to be Guy if I go near a hospital. Suddenly a lot of doctors emerge, wanting to tell me that he’s a hero to them, especially if they’re an anaesthetist. Which I’m not sure is terribly reassuring to hear [laughs].View image in fullscreenL-r: Erin Doherty, Nicola Walker and Stephen Mangan in Unicorn.Photograph: Marc BrennerWhat’s your dream role?I’ve been playing quite nice people or bumbling idiots lately, so I’d like to play someone really unpleasant. It’s always fun to exercise those bits of you.Would you like to play an Irish character?Yeah, I mean for goodness sake! Here I am, Mr Irish – even if I don’t look it. People think I’m a posh English boy, which in some ways I am. I had a posh English upbringing but my family background is entirely Irish. My mum was flame-haired, freckled Mary Donohoe.Your wife, Louise Delamere, is also anactor. How would you feel if your sons wanted to act professionally?Well, it’s given me a fantastic life. I’m forever grateful that I decided not to be a lawyer and became an actor instead. Why wouldn’t I want that for my children? Although of course you’re aware of how precarious it is and how buffeted by the winds of fortune you can be.How do you relax when you’re not working?I’ve had a Spurs season ticket since 1997. It’s been hellish this season. It’s like going to a huge group therapy session, where 60,000 people sit in a circle and try to examine what’s gone wrong in their life to bring them to this point. And I’m a big runner. A two-hour run is my meditation. I’m doing the London Marathon this week.What cultural things have you enjoyed recently?Like everyone else, I watchedThe White Lotus. My son sawA Complete Unknownand has become obsessed with Bob Dylan, so we’ve been ploughing through all the various Dylan documentaries. I listen to a lot of history podcasts and just readHelen Castor’s book on Richard II. In terms of fiction, I lovedThe Bee Stingby Paul Murray,Glorious Exploitsby Ferdia Lennon andTheMinistryof Timeby Kaliane Bradley.You play piano and were in a prog rock band at school. Do you secretly dream of rock stardom?I think all actors want to be rock stars. But the great thing about acting is you can still do it when you’re 80 and no one goes: “Why is he still doing that?”The Fart That Saved the Universeby Stephen Mangan, illustrated by Anita Mangan, is out on 8 May (Scholastic, £7.99).To support theGuardianandObserverorder your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

It was at the head of UTA’s house back in maybe 2015. I’d stolen a bunch of food – they had really good wagyu steaks, so I took 10 wrapped in a cloth napkin, they were kind of bleeding. I bundled them in between my legs, underneath my miniskirt, and was shuffling as fast as I could out of the party when I knocked over Al Pacino. And then I left him on the ground, because the steaks flew out from under my skirt, leaving this bloody streak across the white floor. I grabbed the steaks and ran out of the party and texted Judd Apatow: “Sorry, I had to leave. I hope they catch that guy that knocked over Al Pacino.”What’s the best lesson you learned from someone you’ve worked with?It was from Ted Danson [star of The Good Place], who has an obsession with never taking anything for granted at all, ever. It’s the human condition to acclimate to anything, but he does not let himself acclimate to how lucky we are to have this job. And so even in 110-degree weather when it’s 2am and we’ve been filming for 17 hours, he will never let it show on his face that he has had enough. And he’s in his 70s! He knew he was the leader because he was the eldest and the most experienced onThe Good Place– and so he knew that the whole cast and crew’s energy depended on him. So he kept that [energy] at the very top for every single day of filming, even when he was sick. During filming for that big season finale, he had pneumonia and we didn’t even know. That taught me a big lesson about the importance of holding up the energy on set.View image in fullscreenFrom left: The Good Place’s William Jackson Harper, Kristen Bell, D’Arcy Carden, Ted Danson, Manny Jacinto and Jameela Jamil.Photograph: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty ImagesWhat’s the best job you’ve ever had?My favourite job was working in a video shop, which I did for around four years – from the ages of 15 to 17, then 19 to 21. My dream in life was to be the manager of that store. I dream of such a thing, but video stores have gone. I loved that job for so many reasons, not just because I got to watch movies all day, but also because you got to people-watch. This is pre dating apps, so you’d watch people come in on a Friday or Saturday night to try and hook up with someone; you’d see a guy looking at the video that a woman was looking at, trying to strike up a conversation with her. You’d know who in the village was cheating on each other – you were getting all the goss, it was just the best. And it was the beginning of heroin chic, so everyone was on the Atkins diet and no one wanted the free Häagen-Dazs that you got with a two-DVD deal, so they would give it to me. I was just living my best fucking life. Honestly, I can’t think of a time I’ve ever been more excited to go to work.What are you secretly really good at?Fatboy Slim: ‘I was in the same class as Keir Starmer – he’s one up on me now’Read moreI’m secretly good at drawing. I whip it out once a decade when I have forgotten someone’s birthday and I need to pretend I remembered – so I draw them a portrait. That’s the only time anyone ever learns that I can draw. My boyfriend is the last person who learned I could draw. I’d forgotten to get him something for Christmas, so I went away for a few hours, whipped up a little drawing,and then was like, “Surprise!”When you first get to a hotel do you have any rituals?I always eat chocolate in bed. I worry that it looks like poo stains, so I write notes for the maids that say “not poo” – so that they don’t fear that they’re touching poo – and I leave a $20 note. I also clean before they come in. So it takes ages to get me out of the hotel room because I’m obsessed with never having a cleaner think that I’m a prick. I don’t mind if other celebrities hate me, I just never want my cleaner to hate me.What’s the most chaotic thing that’s ever happened on set?I once tripped over during a paint fight with a pop star on television and I broke half of my front tooth, broke my nose and fractured my elbow, and had to keep filming. I had to use eyelash glue to stick half my tooth back in. It was pretty bad. And it was on camera, and they played it four times that day on Channel 4 – we didn’t really have social media back then, so that was a form of going viral. If you look closely in photographs, you can see there’s a crack across my front tooth. I never was able to get it fixed, because my other teeth are so shit that I would have had to have them all fixed if I got that one fixed.What’s your most controversial pop culture opinion?I think we need to bring old people and unattractive people back into pop, because music is fucking terrible now. Pop stars are too young and they sing about boring shit that only other very young people care about. And enough with the models. They haven’t gone through anything and their lyrics are annoying. I want people who don’t fit the beauty standard back in music. We need to stop centring 17-year-old Instagram models and TikTok stars. So much of the great music we had would have never happened now, because those people didn’t meet the beauty standards. The Beatles, Phil Collins, Dusty Springfield. Music has suffered from too many attractive people.Which word do you hate most?I hate the words “ageing gracefully”. I think they’re just another way to batter women who are in between a rock and a hard place. “Don’t age, but if you do, don’t do anything to stop yourself from ageing.” You’re meant to “age gracefully”, which really just means live until you’re 30, then die. It’s a nasty, elitist, bitchy little phrase that shits on the women who succumb to the immense pressure to not look like they’ve aged. I’m “ageing peacefully”.‘My underwear falls off the minute I hear Tracy Chapman’: Jameela Jamil’s honest playlistRead moreWhat is the silliest thing you’ve done to draw attention to something serious?In order to demonstrate the dangers of diet teas that were really just laxatives, I posted a video of myself screaming while shitting fire on the toilet – obviously pretending to shit fire – as a realistic advert. I decided to do it and an hour later it was done, and then I sent it to my team – and I have a long chain of them begging me not to post it. But it went viral all over the world and went on to cause Facebook and Instagram to change their global policy on showing diet adverts to people under the age of 18. And it was the beginning of the world taking notice of what I was saying about diet culture. It’s the dumbest and most effective thing I’ve ever done.What’s your top tip for surviving internet trolls?I used to be a massive troll and bitch on the internet, and it’s because I wasn’t getting laid and I was unhappy and I hadn’t dealt with my mental health. Now when people are horrible to me on the internet, I remember how I used to feel when I was horrible to other people on the internet and I try to look at them with a little bit of grace and empathy. No one happy and well-sexed is ever writing a horrible comment to a stranger online. There’s a lot of very sad, unstable people who aren’t orgasming enough. If they’re bothering you, they just need to have a wank.

I’m noGeoGuessrsavant, but I’ve spent many pleasant hours puzzling over interesting enclaves and panhandles, or pootling around far-flung locales in Street View. After finishing a recent episode of Severance I opened a tab and took an armchair tour through the remote Newfoundland island where it was shot.I’m not exactly uncovering some mysterious corner of the internet here. Google Maps is so ubiquitous it’s become a utility – admitting I open it for fun feels like extolling the virtues of the Calendar app, or calling up Centrelinkjust to enjoy the hold music.

These are the users who log their every move, amassing hundreds of reviews of everything from restaurants to payphones, detailing opening hours, accessibility features and taking some of the worst food photography you’ve ever seen. I do not understand these people and their currency of points and badges, but I am grateful for them. There is a man who has reviewed every public postbox in Ballarat and had opinions about them all.

What do you think I’ve been doing this whole time?”The incredulity seems fair. The 32-year-old Nigerian singer has been releasing work for more than a decade, running the gamut of genres from hip-hop to Afrobeat to experimental electronics to spoken word, alt-rock and soul. It has made him something of a critics’ darling, but if you’re not familiar with his solo music (his debut album, 2022’sSome Nights I Dream of Doors,was stunning), odds are you’ve heard his lithe, gravelly inflections on Richard Russell’sEverything Is Recordedproject, or warming up UK rap star Little Simz tracks such as 2021’s gloriousPoint and Kill, or sampled by super-producer du jour Fred Again on the 2023 behemothAdore U.The last of these, which interpolated vocals from Obongjayar’sI Wish It Was Me, was eye-opening for Umoh. Appearing on stage with Fred Again to perform the track, he saw how tens of thousands of people were responding to it in real time. It was “crazy”, he says, and invaluable. “Fred knows the crux of the song, the thing that’s going to hold you and shake you, and distils it down to that. And when you see how people relate to something, how it touches people, that’s when I started to get it.” The experience drove Umoh to reconsider what it meant to “write songs” – not as a newly commercial endeavour, but recognising that art should reach people. He comes up with an analogy about aliens needing to translate their language in order to be understood and have actual impact.Umoh is like this: pouring out long, thoughtful metaphors on the spot, gesticulating wildly, full of such sincere warmth and enthusiasm for, as he puts it, “yapping”, that he leaves the full English he ordered untouched for the entirety of our conversation – and then the ensuing photoshoot. At one point he’s waggling his hand in my face in the shape of a gun to reiterate how strongly he stands for his beliefs: “If you said you’d shoot me dead unless I said what you wanted me to say, I’d say, ‘Cool, kill me bro!’”He has not always been this exuberant. Back in Calabar, a port city in south-eastern Nigeria where he spent most of his childhood, Umoh was extremely shy. Aged six, his family laughed at his dream of performing songs to a huge crowd. It was Umoh’s grandmother, of whom he speaks fondly, who coaxed him out of his shyness. She was his main caregiver after his mum, a survivor of domestic violence, relocated to the UK while pregnant with his younger sister. Umoh recalls her encouraging him to be less afraid. “She said, ‘There’s no point. What’s the worst that can happen?’” he recalls. The notion stuck with him, and he now thinks of shyness as its own form of self-centredness: “The only person who really cares is you.”If it sells a million first week? Incredible. If it sells two pounds first week, it’s incredible tooToday, Umoh cuts a striking figure. He is tall, beaming, dressed in an “I heart London” T-shirt, lurid green sunglasses and bulky silver jewellery. “I’ve been awake since 3am,” is the first thing he announces as he takes a seat outside the Deptford cafe he has chosen for our interview, not too far from where he lives in south London. The sun is shining, and he suspects it’s his hay fever that’s been keeping him up. He is also on the precipice of releasing album number two,Paradise Now.It’sa glorious record of big songs, from gleaming pop numbers to strutting basslines to tender quasi-bossa-nova undercut by occasional west African grooves. This is all topped with a playful, Kate Bush-esque knack for the voice as its own instrument: yelping falsettos, silky crooning, seething growls, all woven together with his trademark honeyed sweetness. The album finds Obongjayar dwelling on family, the passage of time, relationships, faith, self, his anger at the British government. None of this is a cynical rehash of Adore U; instead, it seems the lesson Umoh has learned is to whittle further into himself, toying with the bones of classic song structures, repeating the mantra: “Of me, from me, for the world.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Pål HansenSurely knowing that people are about to hear the album has got to be at least somewhat stressful? “I know that I love the record,” he shrugs. “So my thinking is: it’s gonna come out and whatever’s gonna happen, it’s gonna happen. It’s like a fingerprint, it’s your voice – there’s nothing you can do about how people receive that. If it sells a million first week? Incredible. If it sells two pounds first week, it’s incredible too. I’m just in this place of contentment.” He likens the feeling to getting on stage. In live performances, Umoh exudes vibrancy, the music moving through him, a picture of confidence. “I know what I am, I know what I can do,” he says, “I wrote the songs, I love the songs – it came from me. So performing the songs is not this gigantic thing … it’s just me breathing.”Clearly, his grandma’s words have had an effect. By the time he was 17 and had moved to Ashford, Surreyto live with his mum, Umoh was uploading raps online, putting on an American accent. He went to university in Norwich, where he began to sing in his own voice, and it was not long after that his SoundCloud began to gain traction. Still, early 2000s hip-hop was his first love, and he points to the genre as an example of what all great art should aspire to do: “When people say that a lot of white people love hip-hop or whatever? [That means] it can translate to people who have nothing to do with that culture nor have any experience or understanding of it. That’s music that has had an effect on the world.”The Conservatives, Keir, it’s the same shit; they’re so spineless and it pisses me offUmoh does not shy away from politics in his music. His first album featuredMessage in a Hammer, a track about the 2020Lekki toll gate massacrein Lagos; onParadise Now,there’s Jellyfish, a scathing song about spineless British politicians. For Obongjayar, like his heroes Fela Kuti and Bob Marley, music having a message does not mean it has to be at the expense of a good tune. “I think there was a point where I was like …” he puts on an affected, earnest voice, “‘I gotta be conscious, bro, I gotta write stuff that’s gonna change the world!’” He laughs. “Nah man, I don’t think music operates like that, or that it has the licence to do that. Saying what you feel shouldn’t come at the cost of the music. If you’re trying to hammer in a message, you’re putting yourself in front of the thing and it becomes indulgent. If you shout at people, no one gives a shit.”Watch the video for Sweet Danger by Obongjayar.Jellyfish is an engrossing, high-energy rager with distorted staccatos of electronics and percussion. Only by listening closely will you hear lines like: “My heart is watermelon” and “Bomb bomb spawned by the stars and stripes”. For Umoh, this isn’t telling people what to think, but rather expressing his own anger. “Seeing how governments move, people in power, corporations – how for whatever monetary reasons you sell yourself,” he says, hitting the table for emphasis. “I was really pissed off with how spineless Britain was in response to Israel-Palestine. Waiting for America? Why are you being such a bitch, bro? You’re in a position where you can turn the tables, where you can say, ‘That’s fucked up, that’s wrong, we don’t stand for that.’ The Conservatives, Keir, it’s the same shit – they’re so spineless and it pisses me off.”On social media, Umoh is “Obongjayar, Devil Slayer”, but he says this is more about reckoning with his own demons. Umoh was raised as a Christian, and though he wouldn’t describe himself as such these days, his work and person is still imbued with spirituality. Album twofinds cries of “hallelujah!” and reflections on prayer – and, obviously, it’s calledParadise Now.He explains: “This isn’t about paradise as a destination. I think paradise is now, it’s here, this is part of it. Every moment is an opportunity to soak in beauty. It’s not taking ‘now’ for granted, it’s your relationship with yourself and the world around you.”For Obongjayar, success will be in his ability to communicate that sentiment through writing songs. As he says: “The most important part is being able to take my perspective on how I see the world and where I’m from, what my mind sees, and translate that vision into a language where everyone else can understand what it is. That’s peak artistry.”Paradise Nowis released on 30 May via September Recordings.

Catalonia, to Ford’s mind, was “no place for the man of pleasure, taste or literature … here cotton is spun, vice and discontent bred, revolution concocted”. He found Valencians “vindictive, sullen, fickle and treacherous”, while reporting that the “better classes” in Murcia “vegetate in a monotonous unsocial existence: their pursuits are the cigar and the siesta”.Ford, whose often acid nib belied a deep love of all things Iberian, is one of 20 British authors profiled in a new Spanish book,Los curiosos impertinentes (“the annoyingly curious”), that explores the UK’s enduring fascination with Spain and reflects on how two centuries of travel writing have shaped the country’s image abroad.The book is prefaced by Ford’s pain quotation and by another, from the late Spanish writer Ramón J Sender: “There’s nothing like a foreigner when it comes to seeing what we’re like.”The writers selected by the book’s author, the British journalist and writer William Chislett, include Ford and his contemporary, the Bible salesman George Borrow, as well as some of their 20th-century successors, among themLaurie Lee, Gerald Brenan, Norman Lewis, VS Pritchett andRobert Graves. Authors from more recent decades are represented byMiranda FranceandGiles Tremlett, and by the late Michael Jacobs, to whom the book is dedicated.View image in fullscreenRobert Graves outside his house on the island of Majorca.Photograph: GRANGER/Historical Picture Archive/Alamy“I deliberately began in the 19th century with Ford and Borrow and didn’t go further back because I felt I had to start somewhere,” says Chislett, who has lived in Spain for almost 40 years. “One could regard Ford’s book as the first travel book … Then we skip forward to the 20th and 21st century for 18 other people, most of whom are absolutely unknown here, let alone in the UK.”The book, which was originally conceived of as an exhibition, is published by the Instituto Cervantes, the governmental organisation tasked with promoting the Spanish language and Hispanic culture.Chislett says there is no escaping the fact that all the books he cites “have forged an image” of the country that has shifted over the centuries.He points out that the old British idea of Spain as a dark, devout place – built on anti-Spanish propaganda and best summed up bythe austere majesty of El Escorial, Philip II’s monastery-cum-palace near Madrid – began to give way to something altogether more wild and romantic in the 19th century. In the aftermath of the peninsula war, Britons began to be seduced by Spain’s history, architecture and culture, and El Escorial had given way to the distant, Islamic splendours ofthe Alhambra in Granada.“It was unknown territory and had all these exotic elements,” adds Chislett. “Word got around that there were all these abandoned castles and flamenco … You’ve got these two contrasts: you’ve got the ‘black legend’ version of Spain and then you’ve got the romantic version of Spain.”Borrow and Ford were followed by Lee, who immortalised Spain on the cusp of civil war inAs I Walked Out One Midsummer Morningand by Lewis, whoseVoices of the Old Seacaptures a dying way of life in Farol, a profoundly superstitious village on the Costa Brava, as fishing gives way to mass tourism.The authors’ reflections also reveal that concerns over what is known today asovertourismare hardly new. Ford, who perhaps did more than most to put Spain on the tourist map, complained that the “implacable march of the European intellectual is crushing many native wildflowers”, while Pritchett later lamented that Spain had been “invaded by tourists”.Equally familiar, as Chislett and others mention, is Spain’s love-hate relationship with how it is viewed through foreign eyes. “Maybe Spaniards are prickly because so much has been written about them,” he says. “I haven’t come to any conclusion, but maybe you could say Spaniards – unjustifiably now, but maybe justifiably during the Franco regime – have an inferiority complex, which I like to think they’ve got rid of totally, given what’s happened over the last 50 years.“In many ways, Spain is way ahead of other European countries.”While Chislett describes the book as a “labour of love” and an attempt to repay Spain for its kindness and hospitality over the past four decades, he hopes it will also introduce Spanish readers to some of the great British travel writers. “There are books earlier than Ford and Borrow, going back to the 18th century,” he adds. “It’s about highlighting this tradition, which still goes on.”In his foreword to the book, the Spanish novelist and travel writer Julio Llamazares advises his compatriots to cast aside their “pride and patriotism” so that they might glimpse themselves anew in its pages.“It’s worth being prepared to accept the foreign gaze or, perhaps more accurately, the foreign gazes, given how many authors have written about us after touring our country and getting to know it,” he writes.“Like English-speaking Quixotes, they paint our portraits with their words, even as they demonstrate their passion for a country and a culture that, despite being so different to their own, has marked them forever and for life.”Explore more on these topicsTravel writingThe ObserverSpainSpain holidaysLaurie LeeRobert GravesGranada holidaysEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Authentic-looking exotic flowers lined the floor, tree trunks soared up to an artificial canopy and reeds hung from their branches. Peering between them was Hollywood A-lister Scarlett Johansson.The extravagant construction was a set in Sky Studios Elstree where the movieJurassic World: Rebirthwas being made. Filming there, instead of in an actual jungle, enabledUniversal Picturesto pocket millions of pounds of UK taxpayers’ money to partially cover its blockbuster costs.Jurassic World: Rebirth, which is released in cinemas in July, is thethird movie about dinosaursthat Universal has made in the UK. Recently filed documents reveal that HMRC gave its predecessor, 2022’sJurassic World: Dominion, £89.1m – believed to be the largest payment for a film since the UK government incentive scheme began in 2007. The scheme, designed todrive investment in the UK’s film industry, gives studios a reimbursement of up to 25.5% of the sum they spend on making a movie in the UK, provided that at least 10% of its total cost is incurred there.Analysis of more than 400 sets of filings also shows thatDominionwas one of the most expensive movies of all time, with total costs of £453.6m, just overtaking the £452m spent onStar Wars: The Force Awakensin 2015.The £89.1m from the incentive scheme, along with £2.8m from the coronavirus job retention scheme, brought the net cost of makingDominiondown to £361.7m. Its 2018 prequel,Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, banked a further £70.7m from the scheme, bringing the total to £159.8m for the two. Universal’s movie division made combined profits of £3.9bn ($5.2bn) during the time thatDominionwas made.View image in fullscreenOn the set of dinosaur blockbuster Jurassic World: Dominion.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyThe latest data from HMRC shows that, in 2023, it handed a total of £553m to movie studios, bringing the total paid since 2007 to £5.9bn. When it increased the level of tax relief for the film industry about a decade ago, the government noted that “this measure is expected to have a positive impact on the film industry, but is not expected to have significant wider macroeconomic impacts”.The latest data from the British Film Institute (BFI) shows that, in 2019, every £1 of reimbursement handed to studios generated £8.30 of additional Gross Value Added (GVA) benefit for Britain’s economy. It led to a total of £7.7bn in GVA being generated by the film incentives in 2019.View image in fullscreenLaura Dern in a scene from the £453m movie Jurassic World: Dominion.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyReleased in December 2021, the BFI’s Screen Business report shows that, between 2017 and 2019, the incentives to studios yielded a record £13.5bn of return on investment to Britain’s economy and created more jobs than ever before. Filming drives spending on services such as security, equipment hire, transport and catering. In 2019, this spending created 49,845 jobs in London and 19,085 throughout the rest of Britain. Universal alone spent £37.5m on the staff behindDominionandFallen Kingdom.Critics, however, have queried the effectiveness of the scheme. Some argue that Britain’s filming facilities, talent and landscape are strong enough to attract studios without incentives, so the UK could reap the benefits without the government needing to spend any money.John O’Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, which campaigns for reform of UK taxation , said: “It’s little wonder that the majority of taxpayers feel hard done by when they see the eye-popping sums saved by larger companies. Inward investment is a major boon for the UK but the right balance must be struck.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The cost of movies made in the US is usually a closely guarded secret as studios tend to absorb the cost of individual films in their overall expenses and don’t itemise how much was spent on each one.In contrast, studios set up separate companies for movies made in the UK to show more than 10% of the total cost was spent here, in order to qualify for the scheme. The companies have to file annual accounts, which lifts the curtain on everything from staff numbers and salaries to total costs.Dominionstarred Chris Pratt, along with Laura Dern, Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum – the original cast of the 1993 Oscar-winnerJurassic Park. It was made at the height of the pandemic in 2020, causing the cast to quarantine for five months at the opulent Langley hotel, a former manor home of the third Duke of Marlborough where rooms cost more than £400 a night.William Sargent, chair of London-based visual effects firm Framestore, said: “The spend happens and taxes are paid a year at least before the government writes a cheque in return.” He added that film industry workers then spend the money they have been paid which, in turn, generates more tax receipts for the government: “If you follow the actual tax collection against the impact of this onward money, it vastly exceeds the payout.”Universal Pictures was contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsFilmThe ObserverUniversal PicturesJurassic WorldTaxnewsShareReuse this content"

Kotcheff’s beginnings as a hired hand in Canadian television left him well-placed to become one of the most versatile directors in commercial cinema.How could the same man who made the terrifying thrillerWake in Fright(1971), which Martin Scorsese called “disturbing” and “beautifully calibrated”, be responsible also for the lively coming-of-age comedyThe Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz(1974) starring a young, zingy Richard Dreyfuss? How could one film-maker leap from the grittyFirst Blood(1982), with Sylvester Stallone as the Vietnam veteran and proto-survivalist John Rambo, to the macabre slapstick of Weekend at Bernie’s (1989), in which two insurance company employees try to pass off their dead boss as living?View image in fullscreenTerry Kiser in Weekend at Bernie’s, 1994.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/Cinematic/AlamyKotcheff did. And he did it exceedingly well, without ever repeating himself. He turned down the sequel to First Blood, reasoning that Rambo was “a man who abhorred violence [and] wrestled with the moral dilemma of violence in Vietnam” whereas the follow-up turned him into “a gratuitous killing machine”. He also declined to direct the Weekend at Bernie’s sequel, saying he had “run out of dead man jokes, or at least the desire to stage them”.It was more his style to make, say, a TV version of Jean Cocteau’s The Human Voice with Ingrid Bergman, which he did in 1967, or Billy Two Hats (1974), starringGregory Peck, which had the distinction of being the first western shot in Israel.He was born William Kotcheff in Toronto, to immigrant parents – Theodore, a Macedonian restaurateur, and Diana (nee Christoff), who was Bulgarian – and raised in the slum neighbourhood known as Cabbagetown. He accompanied his parents to rehearsals for their leftwing theatre group, which put on plays in a Bulgarian-Macedonian hall, and appeared on stage at the age of five as a village child in The Macedonian Blood Wedding. He was educated at Silverthorn public school and Runnymede collegiate institute and graduated in 1952 from the University of Toronto with a degree in English.View image in fullscreenDonald Pleasence, left, and Gary Bond in Wake in Fright, 1971.Photograph: United Artists/Cinematic/AlamyIt was during his early days at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) that he changed his first name: the company already had 12 Bills working there, so he promoted one of his middle names (Theodore), though he reverted to William for the credits on his first film, the comedy-drama Tiara Tahiti (1962), starring James Mason.In 1953, he travelled with a fellow CBC stagehand to New York for a holiday, only to have his entry to the US barred because of his brief membership, six years earlier, of the Left Wing Book Club in Toronto. The ban shaped the next few decades of his career. “It marooned me professionally in Canada, which had no film industry whatsoever at that time,” he said.Nevertheless, he quickly made his mark in television, directing a major anthology series at 24 and proceeding to live TV drama. Eager to expand his talents, he was stymied by the lack of a national cinema and the monopoly that British directors had on directing Canadian theatre.While compatriots such asArthur HillerandNorman Jewisonhad relocated to Hollywood, Kotcheff headed for the UK, where he found TV and theatre work. It was during the transmission of his live TV play Underground (1958), about survivors of a bomb attack on London, that the actor Gareth Jones, who played the villain, suffered a fatal heart attack. As Jones was stretchered away, Kotcheff hastily rejigged the third act to conceal the sudden absence of the drama’s chief antagonist. “One TV critic thought it was a brilliant narrative device of mine to eliminate the character,” he said.His second film, Life at the Top (1965), followed the main character from the kitchen sink drama Room at the Top, again played by Laurence Harvey and now married with two children but with a wandering eye and vague political ambitions. It brought Kotcheff to the attention ofMichelangelo Antonioni, who sought his advice on cutting 20 minutes from his existential thriller Blow-Up (1966). “He ended up using practically all of my suggestions,” Kotcheff said.View image in fullscreenThe Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz, with Richard Dreyfuss, centre, 1974.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyHis stock continued to rise with the award-winning TV film Edna, the Inebriate Woman, broadcast in 1971 as a BBC Play for Today to an audience of more than nine million. Written byJeremy Sandford, also responsible for Ken Loach’sCathy Come Home(1966), it starredPatricia Hayesas the title character, who is unhoused and alcoholic. The choice of a predominantly comic actor to play dramatic material was inspired, though Kotcheff had to plead with ITV to release Hayes from her filming commitments on The Benny Hill Show.In the same year, Wake in Fright had its premiere at Cannes, where the young Scorsese expressed his admiration for the film vocally throughout the screening.Evan Jones, with whom Kotcheff had collaborated on the race drama Two Gentlemen Sharing (1969), adapted Wake in Fright from Kenneth Cook’s novel about a schoolteacher who loses all his money gambling in the outback and ends up stranded there. Kotcheff, who shot the film in punishing conditions (“110 degrees in the shade – and there was no shade”), described it as “one man’s descent into hell”.He evoked that infernal mood masterfully, not least in harrowing climactic footage of a real-life kangaroo hunt. But the devil was in the tiniest details, too. Kotcheff specified to the design and costume departments that there should be no cool colours on screen (“I want the intense heat of the outback to be omnipresent,” he told them). He also sprayed the interiors with dust that was tinted the colour of the outback desert, and released small quantities of flies on to the set during every take.His next film, The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz, was adapted by his friendMordecai Richlerfrom Richler’s own 1959 novel about an ambitious and restless young man bouncing from one money-making venture to the next in Montreal’s Jewish area. In one, Duddy (Dreyfuss) hires an over-the-hill documentary maker (Denholm Elliott) to shoot a barmitzvah. In a genius move, Kotcheff includes the hilariously highfalutin result as a film-within-the-film.He described The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz, which won the Golden Bear at the Berlin film festival, as “his entrée into Hollywood”, and found that previous objections to him entering the US had evaporated. He made his Hollywood debut with the comedy Fun with Dick and Jane (1977), starring Jane Fonda andGeorge Segalas a middle-class couple who turn to crime when their fortunes take a downturn.View image in fullscreenSylvester Stallone as John Rambo in First Blood, 1982.Photograph: Thorn Emi Video/AllstarSegal was also the star of Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe? (1978), AKA Too Many Chefs, an eccentric and underrated black comedy to which Kotcheff brought his customary flair and eye for detail. Shooting in Michelin-starred restaurants, it was the only one of his films during which he gained rather than lost weight.North Dallas Forty (1979) was an unsentimental study of life inside the NFL, with Nick Nolte superb as a veteran wide receiver bruised and buffeted by the sport. The NFL refused to cooperate with the production, and it was rumoured that former players who did were later shunned by the organisation.First Blood and another Vietnam-oriented project, Uncommon Valour (1983), withGene Hackmanas a former Marine colonel who returns to Laos to find his missing son, were sandwiched between two films starring James Woods: In Split Image (1982), he was a brutal cult deprogrammer, while in Joshua: Then and Now (1984), again adapted by Richler from one of his novels, he was a writer whose once-perfect life is in tatters.Switching Channels (1987), a comedy set at a TV station, was scuppered by the last-minute replacement of Michael Caine withBurt Reynolds, who sparred constantly with his co-star, Kathleen Turner. Kotcheff never had another box-office success after Weekend at Bernie’s, and drifted instead into directing TV movies, though he had a sizeable small-screen hit on his hands as the producer of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, which he ran between 2000 and 2012.In his 2017 autobiography, he proudly described his filmography as a “gumbo”, and said: “The only thing I have never done is what others expected me to do.”He is survived by his second wife, Laifun Chung, and their children, Alexandra and Thomas, and by three children, Aaron, Katrina and Joshua, from his marriage to the actorSylvia Kay(one of the stars of Wake in Fright), which ended in divorce.William Theodore Constantine Kotcheff, film director, born 7 April 1931; died 10 April 2025Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm industryFilm adaptationsCannes film festivalBerlin film festivalAwards and prizesTelevisionobituariesShareReuse this content"

But when mediated through screens, his connection to his fans is palpableNathan EvansSun 20 Apr 2025 09.47 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Apr 2025 09.48 EDTShareCentral Cee has exported UK rap like no one else before, by sculpting UK drill for TikTok with fast-paced, bite-sized packaging that often remixes a recognisable hit, all sealed with his steely demeanour. An influential fashion figure and Gen Z icon, his success is global and previously inconceivable. His 2023 hitSprinterwith Dave sat in pole position in the charts for 10 consecutive weeks. The crowd at Co-Op Live arena reflects his youth appeal all the way down to primary-schoolers. But while the squealing girls and balaclava-wearing boys have their fun, sometimes it feels as though the rapper is too reticent to join in.Arenas aren’t suited to reserved characters, but Cench, as his fans call him, is smart enough to match the Co-Op’s scale. He stands in front of a multitiered structure that, using screens, becomes an open dollhouse that tells the story of his come-up through the key places in his life, from his family home to his new pad. Unwinding into tracks from his initial mixtapes, his barbed flow rolls like a series of verbal jabs: “Your dad left home from young / And you ain’t done shit for your mum, ah man,” he berates on his breakout 2021 singleDay in the Life.There being 20,000 pairs of eyes on him occasionally produces some wonderfully human moments that overcome his persona. However, if his tracks follow a formula, his performance on stage is no more mercurial. He sticks to a stiff set of hand gestures as if he’s cycling through Fortnite emotes, and when guest verses are often played in their entirety, he’s left clueless as to what to do on stage.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Katja Ogrin/RedfernsThere are no issues vocalising on the mic though. He is just as cosy traversing the Brazilian funk rhythm of CRG as he is the sepulchral atmospheres knocking with doom-stricken gunshot snares on St Patrick’s. On an island stage, he flirts through Me & You in a black tank top and glittered snapback. Some people record on Snapchat, others resort to launching their phones on to the stage in the hopes of getting a photo from the social media king. His onscreen connection with fans defines the show, as he performsGen Z Lovethrough a live FaceTime with fans at the barricades. “If it weren’t for the algorithm, I wouldn’t have found my woman,” he raps to the phone.Central Cee: Can’t Rush Greatness review – conflict and contradiction underpin justly confident rap debutRead moreCench’s biggest solo hits are thoroughly optimised to clock in at under two minutes, but on his debut album Can’t Rush Greatness, he shoots for longer, verse-heavy tracks. So while tracks such as Doja are met with an almost unholy chorus of screams, the moment is over far quicker than tracks like Now We’re Strangers, which are greeted with a more polite response. The show concludes with Cench hopping back in his Yaris, revealing the whole show to be a dream. If only we could relive the highlights some more.At theO2, London, on 24 April andOvo Hydro, Glasgow, on 27 AprilExplore more on these topicsCentral CeeRapHip-hopDrilllive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

This is film-making that doesn’t just show you the horrors of war; it forces you to taste the dust and the choking panic, smell the fear and the cordite and the tinny metallic tang of spilled blood.Warfare, by Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza, is the most forceful and unflinching depiction of combat since Edward Berger’s 2023 Oscar-winningAll Quiet on the Western Front. It’s also one of the boldest and most formally daring.There are certain conventions at play in most war movies. Among them is the unwritten rule that however blisteringly hellish the depiction of combat, there’s a mitigating audience sop in the form of a flag-waving message about the nobility of the cause. Or, at the very least, some attempt at sentimental string-pulling to knit an emotional attachment to the characters. ButWarfare, a forensic, close to real-time re-enactment of a 2006 battle fought during theIraqwar, rejects all that. Co-written and co-directed by Garland and former US Navy Seal Mendoza, the film’s radically stripped-back approach gives us next to no background on the characters, a platoon of Seals, or the operation, a surveillance mission in the Iraqi city of Ramadi. Nor does it take a stance on any moral questions about the Iraq war. Instead, it focuses on evoking, with almost unbearably visceral intensity, the experiences of a group of highly trained professionals who have been hired to do a job. And they are having a really bad day at work.The overriding impression, once the adrenaline has drained away, is of futility, waste and pointless destructionIt helps that the cast – a roster of some of the best and brightest rising talents from both sides of the Atlantic – is exceptional. Canadian actorD’Pharaoh Woon-A-Taiis a watchful, weighty presence as the younger Mendoza, on whose memories the film is largely based.Will Poulteris Erik, the commanding officer coming apart before our eyes;Joseph Quinnis the brash, wise-cracking Sam, front and centre in the blast of energy, powered by Eric Prydz’s pumping EDM bangerCall on Me, which opens the film.Cosmo Jarvisis Elliot, a laconic old hand;Kit Connoris Tommy, the eager newbie with a pink-cheeked flush of schoolboy enthusiasm. AndMay Decemberbreakout star Charles Melton is unflappable, efficient platoon leader Jake. The success ofWarfareis less about the individual performances, however, than it is about the way they effortlessly fit together. The bond between these men, whether during the grinding monotony of endless waiting or at the sharp edge of battle, is almost a character in its own right.Perhaps not surprisingly, given the doubts about its legitimacy, the Iraq war on film has traditionally been a tough sell to audiences. Kathryn Bigelow’s steely dramaThe Hurt Lockerwon six Oscars, including best picture, but it didn’t exactly set the box office alight. Clint Eastwood’s solidAmerican Sniperwas a rare exception – an Iraq war film that was a notable commercial success. Eastwood’s free hand when it came to emotional button-pushing, plus Bradley Cooper chewing his way through a damaged hero narrative, certainly didn’t hurt the film’s prospects.View image in fullscreen‘The bond between these men is a character in its own right’: Warfare.Photograph: Real Time Situation LLCIt remains to be seen whetherWarfarewill suffer from Iraq aversion. Certainly, audiences who balked at the lack of political context in Garland’s previous picture, last year’s similarly bruisingCivil War, may level the same criticisms here. But that would be missing the point: this is a film about the bullet-strafed, boots-on-the-ground realities of war rather than the geopolitical gamesmanship behind it. As such, it feels closer to Tim Hetherington and Sebastian Junger’s 2010 documentaryRestrepo, about a platoon of soldiers posted in Afghanistan, than it does to more traditional Hollywood war movies.Iraq veteran and film-maker Ray Mendoza: ‘Writing Warfare with Alex Garland was like going to a therapist’Read moreBy peeling away the celebratory trappings, the valour and the glory and the duty to God and country,Warfarelays bare an awful lot of questions. The overriding impression, once the adrenaline has drained away, is of futility, waste and pointless destruction. As the Seals make their final, nerve-shredding exit from the house they occupied, now coated in a layer of rubble and blood, one of the Iraqi women whose home the soldiers commandeered approaches an American, pleading to know: “Why? Why?” He offers no answer, and neither does the film. And that in itself is the point.Watch a trailer for Warfare.Explore more on these topicsWar filmsWendy Ide's film of the weekIraqAlex GarlandWill PoulterCosmo JarvisKit ConnorreviewsShareReuse this content"

The family was celebrating Tim’s 20th birthday at their comfortable home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, after lunch in a restaurant. Tim’s mother went to answer the door, calling out as she did so that some of his friends must have arrived to wish him a happy birthday. Instead she found a group of men dressed in black waiting on the doorstep. Bellowing “FBI”, they barged their way into the house and handcuffed Ann and her husband, before marching them outside and driving them away.Alex assumed that there had been a terrible mistake; his parents were much too boring to warrant such a dramatic arrest. But there was no mistake. His parents were not Don Heathfield and Ann Foley, prosperous Canadians living in the US, but Andrei Bezrukov and Elena Vavilova, Russian spies who had assumed false identities before Alex and his brother were born. Together with their parents, the two boys were stripped of their Canadian citizenship and flown to Moscow. Alex was handed a Russian passport, identifying him with a name he could not even pronounce properly. “Typical high school identity crisis, right?” he remarks, with a wry smile but an undertone of understandable bitterness, while being interviewed by the author of this book,Shaun Walker, an international correspondent for theGuardianwho was based in Moscow for more than 10 years.This was an unnatural existence, one of constant strain, isolated from friends, family or home, sometimes for decadesAlex’s parents were products of a programme that dated back to the earliest days of the Soviet Union: planting agents in enemy countries who would live apparently normal lives while spying for the motherland. Such spies were known as “illegals”, to differentiate them from spies with diplomatic cover. The system originated with the pre-revolutionary Bolsheviks, who had operated clandestinely as an underground movement to evade capture by the tsarist secret police. After the Russian Revolution many hostile countries refused to recognise the new Soviet Union, which therefore had no embassies from which conventional spies could operate. These were the heroic years of the “great illegals”, who posed as European aristocrats, Persian merchants or Turkish students while spying on the capitalist enemy, using Bolshevikkonspiratsiya(“subterfuge”) to elude detection. This generation of illegals was wiped out in the purges of the 1930s. Stalin saw enemy illegals where none existed – he was especially suspicious of those who practised deception, though they did so for the communist cause, and he mistrusted or ignored much of the valuable intelligence that they presented to him.During the great oatriotic war, illegals once more became heroes of the Soviet Union, credited with assassinations of top Nazi officials. Then, in the cold war, the KGB selected individuals with outstanding language skills to undergo intensive training so that they might live undercover in enemy countries – principally, of course, the US. Typically, such illegals would assume the identity of someone who had died as an infant. Even in a nation of immigrants, posing as a native for any extended period was extraordinarily difficult, so they would usually be allotted a third nationality – Canadian, for example, or German. This was an unnatural existence, one of constant strain, isolated from friends, family or home, sometimes for decades. Husbands were separated from wives, and men and women allotted new partners from the pool of potential illegals. Couples were warned never to speak to each other in Russian, not even in their most intimate moments; one pregnant illegal feared that she might betray herself by crying out in Russian during labour. Many cold war illegals had no active role. They were known as “sleepers”, ordered simply to lie low and wait until their country needed them.View image in fullscreenElena Vavilova, AKA Ann Foley, in 1983.Photograph: Elena VavilovaIllegals received training in tradecraft familiar to any le Carré reader. A white chalk symbol on a lamp-post indicated that an illegal was ready to make a drop; a blue chalk mark on a bench signalled that a handler was ready to receive it. At any rendezvous illegals greeted their handlers according to a pre-arranged formula. A stranger approached one illegal operating in New York and asked: “Have you read any books by Elie Wiesel lately?” The illegal replied: “No, I have been reading Hemingway.” It would be hard to imagine a more stilted exchange.As Walker shrewdly observes, there was a paradox at the heart of the process. The Soviet Union was a closed society, which struggled to understand the west. The KGB wanted operatives who were intelligent, flexible and worldly enough to slip into the identity of a westerner, yet so ideologically firm as to withstand the strain of living undercover for years or even decades, while remaining oblivious to the increasingly obvious flaws in Soviet society. Many cracked under the pressure. After the collapse of communism some idealistic illegals returned to Russia dismayed by the changes they found. Was it for this that they had sacrificed so much?As part of his desire to restore Russian pride, Putin revived the cult of the illegals. He praised their “strong morals” and “firm character”. In his Russia the achievements of the illegals have been wildly exaggerated; in reality they produced little to justify the enormous effort necessary to train and sustain them, and Walker demonstrates that the meagre intelligence that they were able to gather was often ignored or poorly analysed. Nevertheless their strange lives make compelling stories. The author ends his very readable book by quoting from a recent interview with a western intelligence officer. How many illegals are still out there? asks Walker. “I’ll be honest with you,” his informant replies. “Nobody knows.”Adam Sisman’s most recent book is The Secret Life of John le Carré (Profile)The Illegals: Russia’s Most Audacious Spies and the Plot to Infiltrate the Westby Shaun Walker is published by Profile (£22).

As such, it joins a genre that includes Walter Isaacson’s twin tomes onSteve JobsandElon Musk,Brad Stone’s book on Jeff Bezos, Michael Becraft’s on Bill Gates,Max Chafkin’s on Peter ThielandMichael Lewis’s on Sam Bankman-Fried. Notable characteristics of the genre include a tendency towards founder worship, discreet hagiography and a Whiggish interpretation of the life under examination.The great man under Witt’s microscope is the co-founder and chief executive of Nvidia, a chip design company that went from being a small but plucky purveyor of graphics processing units (GPUs) for computer gaming to its current position as the third most valuable company in the world.Two things drove this astonishing transition. One was Jensen Huang’s intuitive appreciation that Moore’s law – the observation that computing power doubles every two years – was not going to apply for ever, and that a radically different kind of computing architecture would be needed. The other was his decision to bet the future of Nvidia on that proposition and turn the company on a dime, much as Bill Gates had done with Microsoft in the 1990s when he had realised the significance of the internet.Huang was born in Taiwan but brought up in Thailand and the US, of which he is now a citizen. He was a clever, diminutive, driven child who survived bullying at a boarding school in Kentucky but thrived academically. After graduating from Oregon State University he first worked at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a Silicon Valley chip company that competed with semiconductor giant Intel, before moving toLSI Logic, an innovative firm that developed the first design tools for chip architects. So he was in on the semiconductor industry from the very beginning of his career.When Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, two chip designers who worked at Sun Microsystems, the fabled Silicon Valley workstation manufacturer, decided to set up a startup, they asked Huang to join them, on the grounds that he was already an accomplished and successful product manager at LSI. And so Nvidia was born, and Witt’s narrative really gets going.Like most startups, Nvidia had initial ups and downs, but rapidly became known for providing the kind of processors that players of games such asDoomandQuakevalued. Because accurate rendering of imagery in video games required computing power that conventional serial-processing processors struggled to provide, Nvidia moved to experimenting with chips that could do several calculations simultaneously, known as parallel processing, and thus to the development of GPUs.The AI gold rush was on, and Huang was the man selling the picks and shovels – and on his way to a net worth of $100bnParallel processing provided an astonishing advance in computing power and speed. But writing software to harness the technology proved challenging: think of it as switching from thinking in three dimensions to thinking in 5,000. In order to make parallelism more widely usable, Nvidia embarked on a secret project, codenamed Cuda, to create a software platform that would make GPUs – hitherto used only for gaming – into tools that could be useful for any task requiring brute computing power.Cuda turned out to be a masterstroke in two ways: first, it immediately increased the range of applications in which GPUs could be deployed – and therefore the size of the potential market; and second, although the software was free, it only worked with Nvidia hardware!The only remaining problem was to find a market with an insatiable demand for high-end processors. And, as luck would have it, one such market hove into view, sailing under the banner of AI (AKA large language models), the training of which required unconscionable amounts of computing power. Suddenly the tech giants developed an insatiable hunger for Nvidia’s little supercomputer modules. The AI gold rush was on, and Huang was the man selling the picks and shovels – and on his way to a net worth of $100bn.It’s a great story and Witt tells it well. He paints a rounded picture of a remarkable entrepreneur – part visionary, part maniacal workaholic, part inspiring corporate leader. Oh, and part ranting screamer: “yelling at people is part of his motivational strategy”, says one employee; he has “embraced candour to the extreme” says another, tongue firmly in cheek. So it’s a “warts and all” portrait, asOliver Cromwellwould have put it.And just to underline that point: when, in his final interview for the book, Witt asks him what new jobs might be created by AI, Jensen loses it and starts shouting at him. “His anger seemed uncontained, omnidirectional, and wildly inappropriate,” he writes. “I was not Jensen’s employee, and he had nothing to gain from raging at me. He just seemed tired of being asked about the negative aspects of the tools he was building. He thought the question was stupid, and he had been asked it one too many times.”The Thinking Machine: Jensen Huang, Nvidia and the World’s Most Coveted Microchipby Stephen Witt is published by Bodley Head (£25).

Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, who burst on to the US indie scene with the lean, hard-edged dramaHalf Nelsonin 2006 and went on to directCaptain Marvel, return to our screens with the grungy homage to exploitation flicksFreaky Tales. The setting for this baggy, loose-limbed anthology of four interconnected stories is Oakland, California, in 1987. But it’s a parallel reality in which residents are able to channel a glowing green cosmic energy, and in which real-life basketball legend “Sleepy” Floyd (Jay Ellis) is recast as a martial arts master in a stab-happyKill Bill-style revenge spree.It’s not clear whether Boden and Fleck are drawing on Tarantino for inspiration or on the same pulpy grindhouse schlock that informed many of his latter-day exploitation flicks. It hardly matters. With its VHS bargain-bin aesthetic, this is scuzzily enjoyable stuff that pits punks against neo-Nazis, Pedro Pascal’s beaten-up debt collector against Ben Mendelsohn’s chilling corrupt cop; a girl rap duo called Danger Zone against the hip-hop patriarchy. Plus, there’s the added bonus of Tom Hanks clearly having the time of his life as a know-it-all clerk at a video rental store.In UK and Irish cinemasWatch a trailer for Freaky Tales.Explore more on these topicsFilmThe ObserverAction and adventure filmsComedy filmsPedro PascalBen MendelsohnTom HanksreviewsShareReuse this content"

In 1994, living in a Pakistan refugee camp, there was little to do except sleep, eat, pray and dream of the afterlife: “Islam dominated every aspect of life in Shamshatoo. Even during the volleyball and cricket games the spectators were prevented from clapping because it was seen as un-Islamic.” Banayeejoined the camp’s madrasa when he was 14 in an attempt “to fit in”. The only educational opportunity open to Afghans at that time, the religious school offered structure and purpose, although “instead of teaching us to live, they were teaching us to die”.In this illuminating book, Banayee, now resident in England, describes the circumstances that led to his indoctrination, and what eventually saved him.Brutalised by conflict, his Pashtun family lived through the Soviet-Afghan war, followed by the period of bitter infighting between warlords. As a child, Banayee saw his neighbourhood torn apart and corpses rotting in the street: “By the winter of 1994, Kabul had turned into a deserted place, as if hit by Armageddon – a place of daily bombardments, looting and arbitrary arrests. The savagery and violence had no limits.” Banayee, his siblings and brother’s family eventually sought refuge in Pakistan, while his parents remained in Kabul with his disabled sister, Gul, fearing she would not survive the journey.As a child, Banayee saw his neighbourhood torn apart and corpses rotting in the streetIn the refugee camp, Banayee came to see the west as “a world stripped of miracle and wonder” as opposed to one where “ordinary people could obtain miracles directly from God”. Within a year his greatest desire was to take part in jihad.In 1996, following theTalibantakeover of Kabul, Banayee witnessed a “gruesome and medieval” execution ceremony. This experience of intolerance, his growing realisation that Taliban ideology is utterly “tied to seventh-century Saudi Arabia”, and an opportune period of study in a secular institution, changed Banayee. He feels that impressionable boys in camps were “the victims of bad ideas and indoctrination... In a culture riddled with poverty… abstinence and crazed religious fervour, they turned to [radical] Islam for solace.”Describing the conflict that followed in the wake of September 11 as one where “boots fought sandals, helmets fought turbans and reality fought myth”, Banayee found himself caught between the two warring sides. Despite having renounced his “infatuation with the Taliban”, he writes how he “was on record as having argued with enough people to leave the impression that I was some fanatical Talib”. Fearing for his safety, Banayee managed to escape to Europe, landed in England, and found refuge in Ireland.The final third ofDelusions of Paradisefollows a more familiar refugee narrative about the struggle for acceptance and the relentless threat of deportation while waiting to be granted status. Banayee taught himself to read and write in English in order to tell his story and his eye-opening observations about the lure of jihadism and unflinching descriptions of his own experiences of radicalisation make compelling reading.Delusions of Paradise: Escaping the Life of a Taliban Fighterby Maiwand Banayee is published by Icon (£20).

Author Dan Richards is no exception, and it took anuit blanchestranded 3,600 metres up a Swiss mountain to reawaken his sense of night-time’s vast and varied potential. Hopelessly lost, he drew comfort from the occasional blips of aircraft in the sky above and from moving lights in the town below: others, too, were out and about, albeit in less of a fix. What could they all be doing?Overnight: Journeys, Conversations and Stories After Darkdetails his subsequent investigation into “the who and the how of the nocturnal world”. Its pages, immersive and personal, span encounters with night owls of all feathers, from the heroic (Richards hears tales of medalled RNLI bravery on the high seas) to the stoic (shift patterns leave a crane operator at Southampton docks with scant time to himself); and from the intrepid (amateur chiropterologists) to the trapped (he visits but chooses not to quote rough sleepers in Westminster, deeming it too “intrusive”).Darkness sharpens the senses and, even when closer to home, Richards’s observations convey a quality of enhanced realityTravelling to Le Mans for France’s 24-hour motor race, the writer finds actor Michael Fassbender competing and has a quick chat about night’s calm focus. In Finland, he explores the landscape that inspiredMoominland Midwinter, Tove Jansson’s triumphantly crepuscular evocation of a world made unrecognisably eerie by polar night. Darkness sharpens the senses and, even when closer to home, Richards’s observations convey a quality of enhanced reality: the buttery scent of oven-hot croissants fragrant as he joins early rising bakers in Dalston; the sound of a horn immense as he rides beside the driver of a Royal Mail train – “a shuttered ghost” – haring south.“While many people experience similar days, almost every night is unique,” he declares – a conviction bolstered by the book’s diverse structure as well as the eclectic amble of its scope. A chapter about new mothers, for instance, consists almost entirely of transcripts from conversations and voice notes in which women confide their memories of “peaceful, panicked, protracted and psychedelic nights”.Shortly after Richards began his research, the Covid pandemic took hold, and it seemed as though one item on his wishlist – visiting a hospital at night – would prove impossible. Then he caught the virus and found himself rushed into intensive care. “All a bit method,” he joked with medical staff from the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary some months later, but his description of the week he spent there, fearfully drifting in and out of consciousness, is genuinely nightmarish.While the episode leaves Richards with night terrors for a spell, it ultimately fortifies his determination to search for the light, even – especially – in darkness. The pages that follow are suffused with feelings of a type that briefly, back in pandemic times, seemed here to stay: kindness, generosity, an appreciation for the virtues of care and service (he acknowledges it’s an old-fashioned concept), enacted while the rest of the world slumbers.‘The solitude of quarantine enthrals me as much as wilderness’Read moreThis is not a work that claims to be comprehensive, and if the reader finds themselves wondering why, for instance, there’s no real acknowledgment of how gender plays into our readiness to embrace the night, Richards’s freewheeling approach yields ample charm and intrigue, whether he’s gazing up to find “pipistrelles spinning about our heads like a spout of pencil shavings” or pondering what it’s like to actuallybea bat. By the book’s end, night has grown to seem vibrant and companionable, its darkness as much a state of mind as a physical fact.Overnight: Journeys, Conversations and Stories After Darkby Dan Richards is published by Canongate (£20).

This time it’s a 300km hike through the Austrian and Swiss Alps, starting with the Salt Road. It’s a particularly sentimental route for comedian Helen Lederer, whose Czech Jewish father took her skiing there.

Lionel Bart’s musical version of the Charles Dickens novel sidelines a lot of the novel’s darkness and social edge, but when you’ve got fantastic, earwormy tunes such as Food, Glorious Food, Consider Yourself and You’ve Got to Pick a Pocket or Two it’s hard not to prioritise pleasure. Carol Reed’s colourful adaptation is well served by Ron Moody’s sneaky Fagin and a menacing Oliver Reed as Sikes, while Jack Wild’s spirited Dodger makes up for a relatively insipid Oliver – a fault of Dickens, not angelic youngster Mark Lester.SWExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV tonightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.For so many years Devon was viewed as the poorer relation to Cornwall; its coastline less rugged and epic, its beaches smaller, less elemental. For us, the county was always just a cut-through to the treasure beyond and never a destination in itself. The fact that Cornwall was much further to get to somehow proved its remoter superiority. How wrong we were.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.North Devon, in particular, is having a moment. Its 30km coastline is the UK’s first World Surfing Reserve, joining Australia’s Gold Coast and California’s Malibu and Santa Cruz as one of 12 officially chosen. Move over Newquay and Fistral beach.But even if you’re not a surfer, north Devon beaches easily compete with Cornwall’s finest. Our first stop is Woolacombe and what takes us by surprise is the sheer scale of it. An epic expanse of golden sand – quarter of a mile wide at low tide and two miles long – under a dome of bright blue sky framed by undulating green hills. And not a development in sight, thanks to the National Trust which owns the surrounding area.Woolacombe itself is less gentrified than your Padstows or Polzeaths, certainly, but all the more charming for it. The affluent second-home-owners are refreshingly absent and it’s much less expensive, too. There’s no chance of paying £16.95 for Rick Stein’s cod and chips here.View image in fullscreenThe harbour at Ilfracombe.Photograph: Westend61/Getty ImagesWe stop for lunch instead at Fudgies Bakehouse, close to the seafront, where you can feast on fresh pasties and homemade ice-cream for less than a tenner a head, followed by beers at Bar Electric with a sun terrace and views across the beach.Our base for the week is Willingcot, a collection of timber-clad eco homes in a lush green valley two miles inland from Woolacombe. Perfect for families, there’s acres of space, a contemporary open-plan sitting room and kitchen area with outdoor decking and seating where you can watch the children explore the expanse of greenery it’s set in.Close to the house is a bridle path that used to be the old railway line; cutting through pretty countryside, it’s handy for cycling or walking to all the local bays. We follow it into Ilfracombe, less gentrified than Croyde and noticeably less busy than Woolacombe, but worth a visit for its Victorian harbour and, depending on your taste, Damien Hirst’s striking 66ft-high sculpture,Verity, a pregnant woman with sword raised high, her exposed skull and foetus clearly visible. For tea and cake, and splendid views across the harbour, the Lime Kiln café is a handy pit stop.Fifteen minutes down the road is Braunton with a pleasant high street lined with boutiques and cafés. Beyond the village, you can follow the river Caen from Velator Quay with views across Braunton Burrows, a Unesco biosphere reserve due to the rarity of plant and insect life here. You may well spot, as we did, a large and rather hostile-looking herd of cattle, whose grazing helps maintain the dunes’ natural habitat.The next day we strike out for nearby Putsborough, taking a path from the beach up to the top of the hill and then following the South West Coast Path high above the sea. A patchwork of green fields stretches out behind us and either side is the glittering, panoramic sweep of the ocean as we head around the rocky headland of Baggy Point. We end up at Croyde, another bay that’s a surfer’s paradise, although the chief draw for us after a long trek is a pint in the much loved local pub, the Thatch.View image in fullscreenSea views from the South West Coastal Path.Photograph: Victoria Ashman/Getty Images/iStockphotoOn our final day we walk from Mortehoe village to Morte Point where waves crash over the deadly “devil’s teeth”; craggy rocks that have been responsible for many shipwrecks down the centuries. Nowadays you’re more likely to spot seals in these choppy waters – we saw several frisking in the waves below us.After a long trek back to Willingcot, the biggest treat is a glass of wine in the outdoor hot tub, the perfect antidote for blisters and aching limbs after a blustery walk around the headland.Luxury Coastal (luxurycoastal.co.uk) offers seven nights at Willingcott from £728 (sleeps eight), including a welcome hamper.

Starters £4-£16; mains £12-£33; wine from £35I am a potentially dull person to eat with. However much I love and relish food, food is not my friend and I have a host of verbotens,ranging from garlic, onion and chives, which for me are headache-inducing, to butter, which I have always hated. Each meal in a new restaurant where I’m not familiar with the idiosyncrasies of the menu begins, “Do you have anything without garlic?” My meal might end up seeming plain to an onlooker, but this plainness divulges so many nuanced flavours – a grilled chop floods my nervous system with relaxing endorphins. The pleasure of eating something that agrees with me is in itself a huge delight.View image in fullscreen‘Somehow cloudlike’: raw scallop, finger lime, chicken salt, potato cakePhotograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverOffered the chance to be a restaurant critic for a day, my first thought was who would be the most fun to invite as my date. A sadly long-departed film producer friend calledHercules Bellville– Hercy – pronounced that the most important thing about a restaurant was the amount of space between the tables. In his book, food came about third on the list. I agree in part – for me the thing that matters most is the atmosphere.But my number one priority is who I get to converse with, and how much they will enjoy all the things denied to me that I can vicariously experience. For the last 10 years I have been going for lunch with the brilliant fashion journalistTim Blanks. He has taken me for birthday lunches at our local Japanese. We have discussed music, fashion and politics in great detail. He normally drinks the most fabulous-sounding concoctions while I benefit from the contact high.View image in fullscreen‘Insanely good; feather-light’: potato pizzette with mortadella.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverTim accepted my offer of lunch at chef-ownerJackson Boxer’s new restaurant Dove on Ladbroke Grove’s Kensington Park Road in London, which opened in early January; we were already fans of its previous incarnation, the seafood restaurantOrasay, which occupied the same spot and closed on New Year’s Eve 2024. Someone told me that Dove has this incredible burger on the menu made from 50-day dry-aged beef, with gorgonzola on top. They only make something like 15 portions per day and they sell out within minutes. We missed them, but there were other tantalising delicacies to deliberate over.Tim and I usually dawdle for hours, analysing the most recent fashion gossip and the current switcheroo creative director merry-go-round. He had to rush off sooner than usual to get an exclusive phone scoop direct from Haider Ackermann on his Tom Ford debut, so we ordered fast. A few weeks earlier Tim tripped on a tiny kerb differential and somehow managed to break his arm in three places and smash a few ribs. He started the meal with a glass of Château Cantemerle, a Bordeaux that doesn’t usually come by the glass and was one of the “Weekly Specials Pours By Glass” – so that was nice. I opted for a non-alcoholic drink called Jin Jin with lime and soda, which was slightly sweet and vinegary, which is something I adore and find delicious.View image in fullscreen‘Out of this world’: grilled wild sea bream with confit garlic and guindilla peppers.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverThemenuat Dove is inventive with unusual combinations, which are tantalising even for me who is wary of too much artistry in cooking. Writing this a few hours later I wish I had ordered more dishes, but to start I opted for raw scallop, finger lime, chicken salt, potato cake.Tim chose fried-potato pizzette, bonito, burrata, mortadella, but without the mortadella as he doesn’t eat meat, and I don’t like mortadella. Both of these starters were so light, with flavours that kept emerging and multiplying with every tiny bite. The potato bases of both were fried, but somehow cloudlike in their enhancing functions as a base. My morsels of scallops on top of the finger lime were so moreish and each taste was both exquisite and balanced, like an orchestral composition. What was relaxing, too, was the lack of annoyance or resistance we met with when asked to remove things like the mortadella from the potato pizzette, which was insanely good even without it: rich in taste and feather-light to consume.View image in fullscreen‘So much charm’: fior di latte soft serve with olive oil, and oat cookies.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverFor our main we went for grilled wild sea bream, confit garlic (which I didn’t touch) and guindilla peppers for two. Looking around, I spied bowls of chunky-looking duck fat fries, so we ordered them, too, with a bitter leaf salad. The sea bream arrived, opened and flat with its head flattened like a hammerhead shark. The addition of a few elegant guindilla peppers scattered over it turned it into a scene from a meal inBreaking Bad. This fish was out of this world, so fresh and light it fell off under the fork, which was good for Tim’s left-hand manoeuvring. It was so tasty and flavoursome that we barely bothered with the chips (unheard of). The bitter leaf salad was as high class an arrangement of leaves as you could get, but again the fish… Tim said the confit garlic didn’t really add anything, but it was because the bream didn’t need anything.For pudding we both orderedEstate Dairyfior di latte soft serve, early harvest olive oil, oat cookies and a coffee cardamom caramel cream to share. The fior di latte ice-cream arrived like two Mr Whippy’s, with a light sheen of pale olive oil adorning its ripples like tiny rivulets. It almost didn’t matter what it tasted like, it had so much charm – though it was daintily appetising and freezing, accompanied by warm, just-baked oatmeal cookies. The pièce de résistance was the tiny little bomb of flavour that was the coffee cardamom caramel: sweet but not sweet, the texture like a memory from a 19th-century novel. It hit the heart and woke up your appetite all over again. It made you crazy with desire. That is a real art in cooking.View image in fullscreen‘Texture like a memory from a 19th-century novel’: cardamon caramel cream.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverThe food at Dove is amazing. The décor is simple and elegant; light floods in from the windows at the front, and further in there is a roof light that makes for soft, flattering, European-style ambience. The staff who work there are attentive, efficient, friendly and no one asked us whether we were enjoying our meal.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe ObserverRestaurants (Food)Restaurants (Travel)reviewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Waitrose No.1 Castillo Perelada Cava Brut, Spain NV (£11.99, Waitrose)At a time when the world is being pulled apart by aggressively idiotic nationalism, examples of multinational cooperation, however small, can feel particularly precious and poignant. Nowhere more so, perhaps, than in the Mediterranean, where the savagery of war in the east and the brutality of border enforcement in the north make a nihilistic mockery of the very idea of togetherness. At their inaugural event in Catalonia’s Empordà last month, the organisers of the MediterraneanWineSymposium hoped to offer at least some sense of a different world of pan-regional collaboration, however. The event, which took place in the atmospheric medieval castle home of Catalan wine estate Castillo Perelada, saw producers from Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Lebanon, Morocco, Slovenia, and Turkey, and guests from around the world join the hosts – the well-run cellar behind Waitrose’s excellent and good value sparkling wine among other gems – for a largely fascinating programme of talks and tastings.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Planeta Cometa, Menfi, Sicily, Italy 2023 (£36,greatwine.co.uk)In the organisers’ words, the Symposium’s aim was to offer ‘a comprehensive mosaic of the “Mediterranean philosophy” of understanding life and consequently wine’ and to present ‘the Mediterranean as a single region, which is the source of all the cultures that emerged from it’. That may have been a little ambitious for a day’s work. But there’s no doubt the event proved effective in focusing minds on areas of potential collaboration – with one issue dominating above all. As a seminar presented by climate scientists Maria Snoussi from Morocco’s Mohamed V University and Nathalie Ollat, a researcher at France’s National Institute for Agricultural Research, made abundantly and terrifyingly clear, the Mediterranean is in the very eye of the storm of climate change, with temperatures rising 20% faster than the global average, posing an existential threat to wine production. No wonder, then, that so many of my conversations at the event focused on means of mitigation, with many hopes pinned on the resilience of indigenous Mediterranean grape varieties, such as southern Italy’s fiano, as seen at the event in Planeta’s gorgeously richly exotic but fluent white.Vini Noüe-Marinič Erigone Anne Jakot 1er Cru, Goriška Brda, Slovenia 2020 (£24.95,armitwines.co.uk)Is there such a thing as a single Mediterranean wine style? In his talk at the Symposium, Josep Roca, the star sommelier who, with his brothers Joan and Jordi, owns and runs the celebrated three-Michelin-starred restaurant El Celler de Can Roca in nearby Girona, saw a common thread in the way wines made from Mediterranean grape varieties often taste and smell of the Mediterranean flora, in part because they share some of the same flavour compounds. Roca also spoke of the intense light that is a feature of the region – a feature that might be said to be reflected in an extra, vivid intensity of flavour. Tasting my way round the various producers’ stands at the event, however, it was striking that, for all the occasional commonalities, Mediterranean wine is perhaps best summed up by its abundant variety: from the sinuous, silky, blossom-pretty but flinty and incisive white made by Vini Noüe-Marinič near the border with Italy in Slovenia’s Goriška Brda, to the thrilling, mountain-air-fresh whites and reds made from local varieties at high altitudes by Vouni Panayia in Pafos, Cyprus.Explore more on these topicsWineDavid Williams's wines of the weekFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Only joking! I’ll not be eating very much chocolate today because, see past columns and just how much Easter chocolate I have tested.My big weakness at the moment isLuisa’sSicilian Orange. Although for Easter this came in a flat egg or bunny shape (both were £10.50), it’s the bijou bar I really love, £5.25. It’s made using 75% cocoa chocolate (I would actually love it if Luisa went even higher in this), but with studs of candied Sicilian orange peel throughout. It’s the perfect mix. I tuck a little bar of this in my bag when I go travelling to keep me company and I know that, at 50g for the whole bar – the pieces are pleasingly chunky, it will last me two days. I do wish she’d do this in a bigger bar, but then it would spoil the mini-magic.I also enjoyedEponine’sFloral Fondant Creams, £20 for a box of 16. Rose and violet creams seem to be enjoying a bit of a renaissance and these are in a bonbon shape, dark chocolate-coated (milk chocolate would be all shades of wrong here) and the centres are gooey raspberry with rose, and blackcurrant with violet to give a nice sharp zing to the comforting embrace of the violet and rose. These are lovely for a spring birthday. (They do contain food colouring so be careful if you are sensitive to this.)Also, for a post-Easter treat do check outFiona Pâtissière’sgorgeous gourmet boxes, from £9.25.

I sometimes fill a puff-pastry case with such an assembly or present it in a white porcelain dish with a splodge of creamy potato in the retro style of coquille St Jacques. (And when exactly did I last see that on a menu?) The mixture of shellfish and cream is one of my favourite pasta sauces, especially when I take a few minutes to remove the mussels from their shells.The mixture of shellfish and cream is one of my favourite pasta saucesAny aniseed-scented herbs work, chervil or tarragon being good dill alternatives, but also fennel fronds. I even used celery the last time I made this, but you can also finely chop a bulb of fennel instead, letting it cook for a few minutes before you add the vermouth or white wine. You could also swap the mussels for clams, if you are the sort of person who doesn’t mind extricating the little chaps from their shells as you eat.I prefer my Easter chocolate in the form of a crisp, thin egg, so no gooey chocolate cakes from me today. But I do like a cake for an Easter tea. A slice of something I probably wouldn’t normally make that I could offer to others. My earliest memory of cake-making involves a Swiss roll – not the neatly coiled sponge and jam arrangement one might expect, but an easy enough bake, and one open to endless interpretation. The need for something sharp and refreshing led me to fill my rolled-up cake with a mixture of lemon curd and mascarpone (using cream makes a filling too soft to roll) and firmed up my belief that this light, citrus sponge is now my go-to Easter cake.Fettuccine with mussels and dillSweet, plump mussels, ribbons of pasta and the soft, aniseed notes of dill.I rather enjoy teasing cooked mussels from their shells with thumb and forefinger. A delicate job, often done quickly while they are still hot, and leaving you with a pile of tender, rust-beige morsels to stir into freshly cooked pasta, pile on toast or to drop into a puddle of cream and dill. Get into the rhythm of it and you can get through a panful in 5 minutes or so.Once shelled, the mussels are especially good tossed with flat, ribbon pasta, such as fettuccine, cream and herbs. Despite the rule about not eating mussels when there is an “r” in the month being outdated, I still tend to cook more of these little molluscs in spring and autumn.Enough for 2. Ready in 45 minutesmussels600gcelery2 stalksgarlic2 cloveswhite vermouth or white wine125mlfettuccine150g, drieddilla 25g bunchdouble cream250mlScrub and scrupulously check the mussels, by which I mean checking the shells are tight and close instantly when tapped on the side of the sink. Finely dice the celery. Peel the garlic and squash each clove flat with the side of a knife blade.Put the garlic into a deep pan, then pour in the white vermouth or wine. Place over a high heat and, as the liquid comes to the boil, add the mussels and cover tightly with a lid. Let the mussels steam for 3-4 minutes until their shells start to open. Remove the mussels from the heat, then remove each mussel from its shell. Discard the shells and strain the cooking liquor through a fine sieve.Pour the liquor back into the clean saucepan, then place over a high heat, add the celery and a little black pepper. Lower the heat and cook for 3-5 minutes until the celery is just tender.Meanwhile, cook the fettuccine in a pan of deep, generously salted boiling water until al dente. About 7-8 minutes from when the water returns to the boil. Finely chop the dill. Put the shelled mussels into the pan together with the chopped dill and the double cream. Warm thoroughly, then drain the pasta and toss with the sauce. Transfer to bowls and serve.Lemon Swiss rollView image in fullscreen‘Goes well with green tea or a bergamot scented Earl Grey’: lemon Swiss roll.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverThe Swiss roll has been rather neglected of late. A roll-up of soft, light cake and citrus curd, it is something to serve for dessert or tea. It goes well with green tea or a bergamot scented Earl Grey.Serves 8. Ready in 1 houreggs4caster sugar150gplain flour130gbutter50g, meltedorangezest of 1lemonzestof 1For the filling:double cream200glemon curd250gTo finish (optional):A little caster sugar, segments of orange, edible flowersSet the oven at 180C/gas mark 4. Line a 30 x 20cm Swiss roll tin with baking parchment. Break the eggs into the bowl of a food mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Add the sugar and beat until thick, fluffy and well risen, a good 4-5 minutes at a moderately high speed. Remove the bowl from its stand then, using a large metal spoon or rubber spatula, fold in the flour, melted butter and the orange and lemon zests. Do this tenderly but thoroughly, leaving no visible flour.Scrape the batter into the lined Swiss roll tin, pushing it very gently into the corners. (Treating it roughly will lead to a sunken, rubbery cake.) Bake for 12-15 minutes until pale gold and lightly risen.Place a piece of baking parchment on the work surface and sprinkle it lightly with caster sugar. Give it a couple of minutes to settle then, while still warm, turn the cake out on to the sugared paper and carefully peel away the paper the cake was baked on. Starting at one of the short sides, roll up the sugared paper and Swiss roll together and set aside to cool.Lightly whip the cream. Unroll the cake, spread the lemon curd over the underside, then cover with the whipped cream. Carefully roll up from one of the long sides and transfer to a plate using two palette knives. Decorate with more caster sugar and, if you wish, some slices of orange and edible flowers.Follow Nigel on Instagram@NigelSlaterExplore more on these topicsPastaNigel Slater recipesDessertFoodrecipesShareReuse this content"
