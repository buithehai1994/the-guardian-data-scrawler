He insisted the move would be “permanent”.Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, earlier said there would now be “six or seven months of speculation about what taxes might or might not be increased in the autumn”.“There is a cost, both economic and political, to that uncertainty,” he said.Ministers are bracing for a backbench rebellion against the benefit cuts, which are expected to be put to a vote in May. It is speculated that as many as three dozen MPs could refuse to support the government, alongside possible frontbench resignations. However, with Labour’s huge majority, the proposals are expected to get through.Impact assessments of the welfare reforms published alongside the spring statement reflected the toll of an additional £500m in last-minute savings that were forced on the government.They showed an additional 250,000 people being pushed into relative poverty as a result of the cuts to the personal independence payment (Pip) and incapacity benefit.Paul Kissack, the chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, accused the chancellor of “putting the burden of the changing world on the shoulders of those least able to bear the load”.“The government needs to protect people from harm with the same zeal as it attempts to build its reputation for fiscal competence,” he added.But in defence of the cuts, Reeves recounted to MPs the chaos that had followed Liz Truss’s mini-budget.She said “there is nothing progressive, there is nothing Labour, about working people paying the price of economic irresponsibility”.In a speech that stressed the importance of shoring up the public finances in a rapidly changing world, she pledged £2.2bn for defence spending and claimed Labour was making progress in rebooting economic growth.Bar chart showing forecast annual real GDP growth by yearThough the OBR halved its forecast of GDP growth in 2025 to 1% from 2% at her October budget, Reeves hailed the fact that it had revised up its expectations for future years, after judging that Labour’s planning and housebuilding reforms will be good for growth.The welfare reforms were part of a £14bn package of measures aimed at rebuilding £10bn of headroom against Reeves’s self-imposed fiscal rules, in five years’ time.These included a fresh crackdown on tax avoidance and a tight spending squeeze later on in the parliament which is very likely to lead to cuts in unprotected government departments, teeing up a fractious spending review in June.Ruth Curtice, the director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said while Reeves was right to balance the books, she was “wrong to do so on the backs of low- to middle-income families, on whom two-thirds of the welfare cuts will fall”.Helen Barnard, the director of policy at the food bank charity Trussell, said: “The insistence by the Treasury on driving through record cuts to disabled people’s social security to balance the books is both shocking and appalling. People at food banks are telling us they are terrified how they’ll survive.”Reeves used her autumn budget to increase taxes by £40bn, including the controversial rise in employer national insurance contributions, which comes into force next month, alongside a flood of rising costs for consumers, including higher council tax and energy bills.The chancellor insisted she would not have to raise taxes on a similar scale. “We have now wiped the slate clean, and we’ll never have to do a budget like that again,” she said.Bar chart showing fiscal headroom in the past 15 yearsReeves blamed global factors for the deterioration in the fiscal outlook since October. “The global economy has become more uncertain, bringing insecurity at home, as trading patterns become more unstable and borrowing costs rise for many major economies,” she said.Challenged about the welfare cuts at a Downing Street press conference, she stressed that the impact assessments did not include the effects of £1bn in spending on back-to-work measures.“We’re putting £1bn in for targeted employment support to get people back to work,” she said.“So I’m confident that our plans, far from increasing poverty, will actually result in more people having fulfilling work, paying a decent wage to lift themselves and their families out of poverty.”The OBR suggested the changes would lead to an extra 1.3m homes being built, which Reeves said would put Labour within “touching distance” of its 1.5m target by 2029.The OBR said the resulting boost to GDP would bring in an extra £3.4bn to Treasury coffers. Using a favoured phrase of Gordon Brown’s, Reeves called this “the proceeds of growth”.Yet the OBR made clear that if Trump unleashes a global trade war when he announces tariffs next week, on what the White House is calling “Liberation Day”, it would blow a fresh hole in the public finances.The OBR warned that its worst case scenario of a tit-for-tat trade war could “almost entirely eliminate” the headroom against Reeves’s fiscal rules, by denting economic growth.However, the chancellor urged the public to “see where we get to” with the US. “Increased tariffs between our economies will damage both of our economies, and we will continue to make that case for free and open trade,” she added.Reeves and her team are braced for a backlash against the welfare cuts from Labour MPs, who will be asked to support them in May’s vote.The Labour MP Neil Duncan-Jordan said that the “last minute scramble” to tweak the cuts in line with OBR forecasts had “shattered any illusion of a moral case for cuts”.The Guardian view on Labour’s plan for stability: austerity in disguise | EditorialRead moreThe Poole MP added: “We are talking about people’s lives here – my constituents are frightened. This policy will fuel the social determinants of poverty that ultimately create further pressure on the services the chancellor is trying to cut.”Connor Naismith, the MP for Crewe and Nantwich, first elected last year, was among those to say they would vote against the government.“I didn’t come into politics to inflict this on the most vulnerable people in our society, and I cannot vote for changes which will have this impact,” he posted on X.“I know many colleagues are similarly concerned about these proposed changes and are continuing to make the case to ministers that we should change course.”Several other Labour MPs challenged Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, over welfare cuts at a meeting afterwards with a group of backbenchers.One said the discussions were “brutal” and that Jones faced “lots of people kicking off over Pip”. Of about two dozen Labour MPs present, more than half a dozen criticised the cuts and as many as four indicated that they would vote against them, according to people present.Other Labour MPs said the hostile questions came from people who are routinely critical of the government.Peter Lamb, who was among those who criticised the cuts, told the Guardian he was worried that ministers had not appreciated the impact of the change.“Frontbenchers genuinely do not appear to be aware that the changes to Pip will mean there are those with a high level of need who will no longer be able to access the support they need for daily living,” the Crawley MP said.The Liberal Democrat welfare spokesman, Steve Darling, who is registered blind, said: “This is incredibly insulting and shows the government just doesn’t understand the challenges facing people with disabilities.”Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, accused ministers of having “reneged on their promises to the British people” in the election and said the country was “weaker and poorer” as a result of their actions.Explore more on these topicsSpring statement 2025BudgetRachel ReevesEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicsTax and spendingWelfarenewsShareReuse this content"

Without mitigating factors the OfS said it could have been as high as £3.7m, at a time when the sector is struggling owing to financial pressures.The OfS’s main criticism was targeted atSussex’s policy on trans and non-binary equality, which included a requirement to “positively represent trans people”. The regulator warned of a “a chilling effect” that could lead staff and students to self-censor and avoid voicing opposing views, for fear of disciplinary measures.Amid concerns that every university in the country will have policies designed to prevent harassment and hate speech on campus,UniversitiesUK (UUK), which represents the sector, is seeking urgent clarification from the OfS in order to be able to advise members.“It’s absolutely essential that universities uphold freedom of speech and academic freedom, and they are legally bound to do so,” said Vivienne Stern, UUK’s chief executive.“This judgment, however, raises concerns about how universities can, in practice, discharge freedom of speech and academic freedom duties alongside other important legal obligations, for example under legislation to prevent harassment and hate speech.“We will therefore be writing to the OfS to ask for clarity as the judgment appears to find that it is a ‘failure to uphold freedom of speech and academic freedom’ if a university has policies to prevent ‘abusive, bullying and harassing’ material or speech.”In a briefing with the media after the publication of the investigation findings, Arif Ahmed, the director for freedom of speech and academic freedom at the OfS, acknowledged there was a potential for higher fines in future cases.“Clearly, future cases will not be the first case of their kind, so there will be a potential for higher fines in the future,” he said, adding: “I think universities should be looking at their policies and thinking carefully about what they need to do to comply with the law and to comply with regulatory requirements.”Ahmed was forced to defend the investigation and its findings against ferocious criticism from Sussex’s vice-chancellor, Prof Sasha Roseneil, who said they were “egregious and concocted” and claimed no one at the university had been interviewed during the course of the three-and-a-half-year investigation.Describing the process as “Kafkaesque”, she accused the OfS of “perpetuating the culture wars” and said the findings meant it was now all but impossible for universities to prevent abuse, harassment or bullying on campuses.Ahmed responded: “I’ve been really clear since my appointment, we’ve got no interest in getting involved in any kind of culture wars. Our interest is simply protecting freedom of speech.”He acknowledged that much of the engagement with Sussex was in writing, although the OfS did interview Stock. “But we did engage with the university. We looked at the university’s representations to us and considered [them] very carefully, and we took our time over this because we wanted to make sure that we got it right.”Stock welcomed the OfS ruling, saying: “I’m very pleased to see the OfS finding and I hope it sends a strong message to the many universities that still have policies with the very clauses the OfS has ruled against. There is no doubt in my mind that these policies chill lawful speech.”The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said: “If you go to university you must be prepared to have your views challenged, hear contrary opinions and be exposed to uncomfortable truths. We are giving the OfS stronger powers on freedom of speech so students and academics are not muzzled by the chilling effect demonstrated in this case.”Explore more on these topicsHigher educationGenderUniversitiesTransgenderUniversity of SussexEnglandOffice for StudentsnewsShareReuse this content"

But as numerousTrump administrationofficials have claimed that none of the information shared was classified – despite the apparent inclusion of operational details of the US strike on Yemen’s Houthi militia, which has been attacking shipping in the Red Sea – the Atlantic said ina new articleon Wednesday it was now releasing that information.It reproduced numerous messages from the text chat between the Pentagon chief,Pete Hegseth– who said on Tuesday that “nobody was texting war plans” – and top intelligence officials.They included details of US bombings, drone launches and targeting information of the assault, including descriptions of weather conditions.A Signal message shared with Atlantic journalist.A Signal message shared with an Atlantic journalist.They also mention specific weapons to be used, timings for attacks and references to a “target terrorist”, presumably a Houthi militant. There is further discussion of confirmation that a target had been killed, and the use of several emojis.“There is a clear public interest in disclosing the sort of information that Trump advisers included in nonsecure communications channels, especially because senior administration figures are attempting to downplay the significance of the messages that were shared,” the magazine said.“If this text had been received by someone hostile to American interests – or someone merely indiscreet, and with access to social media – the Houthis would have had time to prepare for what was meant to be a surprise attack on their strongholds.“The consequences for American pilots could have been catastrophic.”Trump administration officials have repeatedly claimed that the messages contained no classified information. On Tuesday, after the first article was published, Gabbard and Ratcliffe said the leak contained no classified information.The Atlantic also quoted an email response from the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt – after the magazine contacted the Trump administration to say it was considering publishing the entirety of the email chain – in which she said the chat did not include classified information but also that the White House did not want the messages released.“As we have repeatedly stated, there was no classified information transmitted in the group chat,” Leavitt wrote. “However, as the CIA Director and National Security Advisor have both expressed today, that does not mean we encourage the release of the conversation.”Q&AWhat is Signal?ShowSignal is a messaging app founded in 2012 that allows users to transmit texts, photos, videos and documents, as well as make audio and video calls. It uses end-to-end encryption, which protects messages against hackers and cyberattacks via an extra layer of security. Several other privacy features, such as the ability to automatically delete messages, have made it popular among communities such as journalists and activists that frequently deal with sensitive information.Signal is run by the non-profit Signal Foundation and relies on donations to function, giving it a different business model than other encrypted messaging services such as Meta-owned WhatsApp. It does not track user data to the same extent as Meta and publishes its code to allow for public auditing of its security measures. Signal, like any messaging app, is still vulnerable to human error through methods like phishing attacks or  spyware which can allow hackers to gain access to users’ devices. The Signal Foundation’s president called the addition of The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief a user error rather than a problem with her app’s security.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Donald Trump, when asked on Tuesday about the leak, also said: “It wasn’t classified information,” while adding that the leak was “the only glitch in two months”.After the latest messages were published, Leavitt claimed on X that “these were NOT ‘war plans’. This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin.”Waltz, too, wrote on social media: “No locations. No sources & methods. NO WAR PLANS,”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s a weapon system as well as sequence of strikes, as well as details about the operations,” Krishnamoorthi said. “This text message is clearly classified information. Secretary Hegseth has disclosed military plans as well as classified information. He needs to resign immediately.”The committee’s top Democrat, Jim Himes, asked Gabbard why she had told senators the day before that no details of timing, targets or weapons had been shared.“My answer yesterday was based on my recollection, or the lack thereof, on the details that were posted there,” Gabbard replied.“What was shared today reflects the fact that I was not directly involved with that part of the Signal chat and replied at the end, reflecting the effects, the very brief effects that the national security adviser had shared.”Ratcliffe, meanwhile, said: “I used an appropriate channel to communicate sensitive information. It was permissible to do so. I didn’t transfer any classified information.”Last week, NPR reported that thePentagon warned its staff specifically against the use of Signalbecause of its security vulnerabilities. In a Pentagon “OPSEC special bulletin” sent on 18 March, it warned that Russian hacking groups could aim to exploit the vulnerability.Pentagon warned staffers against using Signal before White House chat leakRead moreQuestions have also been raised about whether some of the participants in the Signal chat might have been using their personal phones.Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, who was in Moscow at the time to discuss Ukraine with Vladimir Putin,wroteon X that while in Russia “I only had with me a secure phone provided by the government” but then explained that the reason he did not make any comments in the chat until after returning to the US was “because I had no access to my personal devices until I returned from my trip”.The messages in the Signal chat were set to be automatically deleted in under four weeks. The Federal Records Act typically mandates that government communication records are kept for two years.The Atlantic said it did not generally publish information about military operations if it could possibly harm US personnel but that accusations from the Trump administration that it was “lying” caused it to believe that “people should see the texts in order to reach their own conclusions”.“There is a clear public interest in disclosing the sort of information that Trump advisers included in nonsecure communications channels, especially because senior administration figures are attempting to downplay the significance of the messages that were shared,” the magazine wrote.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS national securityThe AtlanticYemenUS militaryUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Asked about what citizens should stockpile, she referred toa video on her social media, in which she presents an emergency bag.Today, the EU launches its new#PreparednessStrategy.“Ready for anything” — this must be our new European way of life. Our motto and#hashtag.pic.twitter.com/fA1z8ZvMDA— Hadja Lahbib (@hadjalahbib)March 26, 2025To a soundtrack of off-key jazz piano, Lahbib is shown on the video discussing her emergency stockpile in a tongue-in-cheek way, including ID documents in waterproof casing, canned food, bottled water, matches, a Swiss army knife, cash, playing cards, medicines and a small radio.The strategy was devised to ensure better EU coordination and public awareness in response to a range of potential risks, such as extreme weather exacerbated by the climate crisis, pandemics, cyber-attacks and military invasions. “We must prepare for large-scale, cross-sectoral incidents and crises, including the possibility of armed aggression, affecting one or more member states,” the document states.The commission is also calling for a Europe-wide preparedness day to raise awareness; for the topic to be put on school curriculums; and for an EU “stockpiling strategy” to ensure adequate supplies of raw materials, shelters, generators, and “potentially” food and water.While the EU has no powers over civilian or military uniformed services, it has carved out a bigger role in crisis response since the Covid pandemic led to the unprecedented common purchases of vaccines and medical equipment. Now it wants to go further after areport from the former Finnish president Sauli Niinistölast year found there was no “clear plan” on what the EU would do “in the event of armed aggression against a member state”. Nïïnistö, a special adviser to the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU was better prepared to deal with crises and disasters than five years ago, but needed a change of mindset and more planning to anticipate crises.The plans are likely to provoke a mixed response from EU member states, who perceive threats in different ways. Last week, the European Commission rebranded itsmilitary spending plans“Readiness 2030”,instead of Rearm Europe, after complaints from the leaders of Italy and Spain, who argued the language risked alienating people.In contrast,northern European countries have led the way in emergency planning. Swedish authorities recommend keeping at home a good supply of water, energy-rich food, blankets and alternative heating, as well as investing in a battery-powered radio. Norway advises people to stock up on non-essential medicines, including iodine tablets in the case of a nuclear incident. German households have been urged to adapt their own cellars, garages or store rooms for use as bunkers, while housebuilders will be legally obliged to include safe shelters in new homes – as Poland has already done.Roxana Mînzatu, a commission vice-president, responded to accusations of scaremongering, likening preparedness to taking out accident insurance: “It doesn’t mean much more than the fact that you want to be prepared and you want to minimise the damage, the costs, the suffering that you might go through.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It differs from one country to another, but we can learn from each other.”The strategy was published the day after Denmark’s defence ministry announced it was bringing forward plans to introducemilitary service for womenby two years.Women who turn 18 after 1 July 2025 could be required to take part in an annual ballot from next year to determine if they must perform mandatory military service, something which is already required of men.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionEmergency planningEuropean CommissionEuropeExtreme weatherInfectious diseasesNatural disastersnewsShareReuse this content"

Earlier this year,a landmark inquiry into foreign interferencefound that information manipulation is the biggest risk to democratic institutions.Tuesday briefing: Why every candidate in Canada’s snap election is running against Donald TrumpRead more“Most threat actors remain likely to conduct threat activities and have likely adapted their tradecraft to further conceal their foreign-interference activity, making it even more challenging to detect,” Vanessa Lloyd, deputy director of operations for Canada’s spy agency and chair of the security and intelligence threats to elections taskforce, told reporters earlier this week as the agency laid out its plan to blunt the effects of interference campaigns.Between late January and early February,Chinais believed to have targeted the Liberal leadership bid of the former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, in a “malicious” campaign on WeChat that was viewed as many as 3m times, the security and intelligence threats to elections taskforce said in a news release.On Wednesday, the Globe and Mail reported that former Liberal leadership hopeful Chandra Arya had been disqualified amid concerns over his relationship withIndiaand concerns he could be susceptible to outside influence.Arya, elected to the House of Commons in 2015, was told he was barred from formally entering the Liberal leadership race in later January. Earlier this month, he was also told he was ineligible to run again in his electoral district. In both cases, the Liberal party did not provide further details.According to a security source who spoke to the Globe, while Canada was grappling with the fallout ofIndia’s assassination of a Sikh activist on Canadian soil, Arya travelled to India in August and met the prime minister, Narendra Modi. Arya is not believed to have not informed the government of his meetings.“As a member of parliament, I have engaged with numerous diplomats and heads of government, both in Canada and internationally. Not once have I sought – nor been required to seek – permission from the government to do so,” he said in a statement. “The sole point of contention with the Liberal party has been my outspoken advocacy on issues important to Hindu Canadians and my firm stance against Khalistani extremism.”The Canadian prime minister,Mark Carney, who doesn’t have a seat in the House of Commons, announced late last week he would contest the electoral district of Nepean, previously held by Arya.Carney was asked on Wednesday whether foreign-interference concerns had prevented the party from nominating a full slate of candidates for the current federal election. He told reporters hostile actors were not to blame for the party’s delay in nominating candidates.But accusations of outside influence have also shaken the opposition Conservative campaign, following allegations that India interfered in the 2022 leadership race, with the aim of helping the winner, Pierre Poilievre.The allegations, first reported by the Globe and Mail, suggest the Tory leader’s win was not attributable to outside influence and Poilievre is not believed to have been aware of India’s efforts.“Let’s be honest, I won the leadership fair and square,” he told reporters.But Canada’s spy agency could not share the information with Poilievre because he does not have the necessary security clearance. Poilievre is the only federal party leader who has declined an offer to obtain a security clearance – a position that has received widespread criticism and incredulity.“It’s very weird, because I can’t imagine, from a political perspective, why it’s worth it. I have top-secret clearance, it’s not that hard,” said Lori Turnbull, the director of Dalhousie University’s school of public administration. “It’s very hard for me to get my mind around why a leader who wants to be prime minister would not go ahead and do this. To give your rival something like that, for free, is stupid when you’re fighting a close election.”While intelligence officials have long anticipated and experienced efforts from hostile nations like India and China to sway a federal election, less predictable is the role Donald Trump might play. The US president has launched a trade war with Canada, and threatened to annex the country.Trump has a reputation for sharing false information and his close ally and senior adviser Elon Musk, the owner of the social media network X, has beenimplicated in the amplification of misinformation.Canada’s chief electoral officer, Stéphane Perrault, has said his office was not aware of any specific threats coming from the US.Explore more on these topicsCanadaIndiaMark CarneyChinaArtificial intelligence (AI)IranPakistannewsShareReuse this content"

In a swipe to her critics, she added: “There is nothing progressive, there is nothing Labour, about working people paying the price of economic irresponsibility.”Those deepcuts to welfare were there– including an extra £500m scrambled together at the last minute after the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) rejected the Treasury’s initial costings.A full impact assessment, published alongside the statement, showed the deep costs of those cuts for some of the poorest families in the UK, with anadditional 250,000 people driven into relative poverty– a decision that will cast a long shadow.As expected, the OBR has slashed its forecast for economic growth for this year, from 2% to 1% – and is concerned there may have been a permanent dent to the UK’s productivity, dragging on the economy in the future..But Reeves was able to point to glimmers of hope, too. The OBR has assessed Labour’s planning reforms, one of the government’s most radical policies, and estimates these will boost growth by 0.2% over the five-year forecast period. It is actually expecting the economy to be larger in five years’ time than it anticipated in October.The chancellor sought to make a positive case for the uplift in defence spending, too, stressing the government’s hopes for skilled job creation, from Portsmouth to Barrow, and the opportunities for spillovers from new technologies.While it horrified many Labour backbenchers, the switch from aid to defence spending is helpful in meetingReeves’s fiscal rulesbecause defence tends to be more investment-heavy – and the chancellor’s’ rules allow her to borrow to invest.Critics complain that Reeves has no coherent economic philosophy. To the extent that she does, it includes the fact that longstanding underinvestment is a key explanation for the UK’s underperformance..The looser debt rule she adopted in October helps to prevent the cuts in investment spending previous chancellors tended to reach for when times were tight: what Reeves called “the Tory choice”.On day-to-day spending, where her “stability rule” bites hard, balancing the books is much more of a challenge, and she has squeezed budgets in the later part of the forecast period. The OBR now says departmental spending will increase by just 1.2% a year from 2026-27 onwards – down from the 1.3% promised in the budget – after a 4% bump in the current year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Part of the fund will help pay for thecivil service redundancies package, as the government tries to slash admin costs, for example; it could also be used to fund more up-to-date IT to make services run better. But cost-cutting in public services already worn thin by years of underinvestment will not be easy.If public services are not showing noticeable improvements in the run-up to the next election, political pressure to ease the purse strings will be intense, including from Reeves’s cabinet colleagues.And while the chancellor was boxing and coxing to accommodate every last few million quid in the OBR’s new forecasts, and rebuild the £10bn headroom she left herself in October, the world was continuing to change rapidly around her.Next Tuesday is “Liberation Day” in Washington, when Donald Trump will announce what tariffs he plans to slap on the world’s exports. The OBR reckons that if he kicks off a global trade war, Reeves’s painstakingly restored headroom could evaporate, once again.She would then be back in the autumn, with diminishingly few options at her disposal, beyond raising taxes.Explore more on these topicsSpring statement 2025Rachel ReevesEconomicsEconomic policyBenefitsWelfareEconomic growth (GDP)analysisShareReuse this content"

The work continues because they deserve nothing less.”It was a worthy sentiment, perhaps, but the uncomfortable truth is that the statement was being issued as Sentebale – named “forget-me-not”, in the local language ofLesotho, in honour of Harry’s late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales – was in the midst of a spectacular implosion.Harry and Seeiso had earlier taken the “unthinkable” decision tostand down as patronsover the “untenable” leadership of Dr Sophie Chandauka, the chair of the African charity’s board.Chandauka, a Zimbabwe-born corporate lawyer, in turn unleashed an eye-watering attack in which she made little effort to hide her scorn for the youngest son of King Charles.View image in fullscreenDr Sophie Chandauka.Photograph: Yaroslav Sabitov/PA“There are people in this world who behave as though they are above the law and mistreat people, and then play the victim card and use the very press they disdain to harm people who have the courage to challenge their conduct,” she wrote.“Beneath all the victim narrative and fiction that has been syndicated to press is the story of a woman who dared to blow the whistle about issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir [misogyny directed towards black women] and the cover-up that ensued.”Chandauka added that she had made an application to the high court in order to stay in her position and had reported the charity’s trustees, who have also resigned, to the Charity Commission for investigation.Chandauka’s lawyers declined to provide further details as to their client’s case against Sentebale. Harry’s PR team have resisted attempts to be drawn further on the affair. But insiders suggest that at the heart of the drama was a clash of cultures.‘The field of human ancestry is rife with racism’: pioneering project to build cancer database in AfricaRead moreOver a 20-year career, Chandauka has worked for some of the world’s biggest companies, including Meta, Morgan Stanley and the Virgin Group. She inherited a successful charity but one that some concede had become reliant on the annual Sentebale polo cup and a certain section of society dipping into their pockets.According to one account, the charity survived the financial fallout of the Covid pandemic largely thanks to a pro bono performance by the pop star James Blunt, who was previously an army officer in the Household cavalry, at the Cotswold home of the previous chair, Johnny Hornby.Chandauka “wanted to do it differently”, said a source. It is understood that a decision was made to hire the “women-led strategy firm” Lebec at a significant cost. This led to a shift of the charity’s leadership away from London to southern Africa. Fundraising efforts would also now be focused more on the west coast of the US than the shires, according to one source.Last April, Lebec “convened a reception, panel discussion and intimate dinner to highlight Sentebale’s impactful work” at the Zaytinya restaurant at the Ritz-Carlton on Miami’s South Beach.There was then a visit by Harry to Lesotho and Johannesburg with executives from potential donors, including Google.Insiders who have worked in Sentebale said they could understand the move away from “a bunch of white blokes”. It was also one that chimed with the wider thinking in Africa about the role of western charities.Prof Bhekinkosi Moyo, at Wits business school at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, said: “There is value in proximity. A number of times institutions fly in, almost like they are parachuting into the region.“They struggle with localisation, but also they struggle with understanding what the issues are, because culturally they may not be attuned to what’s going on … That notion of a white gaze or parachuting in to solve people’s problems.”The problem for Sentebale, according to one insider, was that the strategy did not elicit the major donations that had been foreseen.“They got back, and I think the story was because Donald Trump’s come these donors aren’t as interested as we thought,” a source said. “I think the trustees then started moving towards thinking she should stand down.”Chandauka then “sued the charity to remain” in her “voluntary position”, according to a statement from Harry’s spokesperson.Sentebale insiders said they could not see how Chandauka could keep the charity afloat without its royal patrons.In a statement to the Guardian, her spokesperson said that “a lot of information being shared is untrue and defamatory in nature”.They added: “When we are ready as an organisation, we will share more detail regarding the events leading up to this point. Moreover, the board acts collectively on major decisions, and it would be inappropriate to assume decisions were made by any one person.”Explore more on these topicsPrince HarryAfricaLesothoCharitiesVoluntary sectorfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it is a smart, nuanced documentary that blossoms into something profoundRebecca NicholsonWed 26 Mar 2025 18.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 26 Mar 2025 18.02 EDTShareThere is a neat trick, used sparingly but to great effect, in Rose Ayling-Ellis: Old Hands New Tricks. According to the Royal National Institute for Deaf People, 80% of adults over the age of 70 will have some hearing loss. To demonstrate what this loss might be like for hearing viewers, the programme-makers amplify the background noise until it obfuscates the conversations that are taking place. The point is made simply and well.Ayling-Ellis made her name as an actor on EastEnders, but became something of a national treasure when she won Strictly Come Dancing, as the programme’s first deaf contestant. Her sensational Couple’s Choice dance with Giovanni Pernice, in which the music cut out while the dance continued in silence, is one of the show’s all-time great moments.Initial uptake for the classes is low, and the attendees are late. ‘They’re a tough crowd,’ says Ayling-EllisIn this charming, intelligent and emotional two-part documentary, she makes a hard sell for what she says is her passion project: teaching British sign language (BSL) to older people who may be struggling with hearing loss. She explains that she understands the frustration of not being able to hear what people are saying around her, and repeatedly emphasises the importance of being understood, connected and included. Sign language, she thinks, can be helpful, not just for the profoundly deaf but for people who may be losing their hearing, too. In order to test her theory, she persuades the residents of a retirement village in Buckinghamshire to embark on a pilot scheme with her.Hughenden Gardens Village is not a regular retirement home; it’s a cool one. It looks a bit like a hot-desking office crossed with a brand new school or hospital, and there are more than 300 older people living there, with an average age of 80. One resident describes it as “a combination of a hotel and a holiday camp”, which seems about right. Ayling-Ellis is filled with enthusiasm when she arrives, but it is to the credit of this series, and the benefit of its narrative arc, that setting up BSL classes for the residents proves quite a bit trickier than she expected.She is nervous before she delivers the pitch to residents, and fumbles it. The initial response is far from positive; one woman points out that she is 101, and therefore too old to learn new skills. Ayling-Ellis appeases her, says she isn’t. “I’m not really interested, you know,” the woman replies, not unkindly, but firmly nonetheless. Belinda, the friendly village manager, suggests that they put a six-week limit on the course. “They can be quite forgetful,” she explains.View image in fullscreen‘A combination of a hotel and a holiday camp’ … Rose Ayling-Ellis and residents of Hughenden Gardens Village in Old Hands, New Tricks.Photograph: Ricky Darko/BBC/Rogan ProductionsInitial uptake for the classes is low, and the attendees are late. “They’re a tough crowd,” says Ayling-Ellis. But she is not put off, and the fact that the BSL classes take place at all are a combination of tenacity and sheer belief. She calls upon a charismatic BSL teacher, Marios Costi, to tutor them, and he proves more than up to the task. And of course, while some of the early mishaps are lightly funny, it blossoms into something beautiful and profound.We learn more about the Hughenden residents, and their loves and losses. At times, it becomes a meditation on not just mortality, but what it means to live life with purpose and dignity, and how we might start to resist loneliness. Eric has been married to June for 69 years. She has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, and Eric says he no longer speaks to many people because he struggles to hear in crowds. He comes out of his shell in the BSL classes, to his daughter’s astonishment.This is more than a fairytale, however. It is nuanced and smart. Ayling-Ellis explains that she has mixed feelings about hearing aids, which many older people come to rely on; she says they are seen as a panacea, when that isn’t really the case. Learning BSL offers a more expressive way to communicate and, in turn, that reduces the risk of isolation, not feeling understood and not fitting in.There are many moving moments in which we see the possibilities. Sue is losing her sight. She needs to learn braille, but admits she is scared that she is too old to do it. Ayling-Ellis takes her to meet Michael, who was born deaf, then lost his sight, and now communicates with hands-on signing. He tells her not to give up. I have a lump in my throat.The wider point is that BSL can, and must, be learned by more people than those with hearing loss. Here, you see how it can spread. The village staff begin to learn it. Eric’s grandchildren show off a few words. If it works as well on everyone else as it does on me, viewers should come away with at least a few new words for themselves, too.Rose Ayling-Ellis: Old Hands New Tricks aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewRose Ayling-EllisTelevisionDeafness and hearing lossOlder peoplereviewsShareReuse this content"

Stylists on 20 free and easy ways to liven up your lookWhen you’re tired of your clothes, it can be tempting to shop. But you can transform your style with what’s in your wardrobe, by embracing everything from visible mending to debobblers and bold accessoriesSarah PhillipsWed 26 Mar 2025 12.36 EDTLast modified on Wed 26 Mar 2025 12.39 EDTShareAs the seasons change, it can be tempting to buy new items of clothing, but a more sustainable and affordable approach is to work with what you already own. We asked stylists how to revive and refresh your look – using what is already in your wardrobe.Audit your wardrobeFor most people, this means having a clear-out. “Too much choice is paralysing,” says Alexandra Fullerton, a stylist from Suffolk and author ofHow to Dress. “If you’ve got hundreds of items of clothing to choose from, where do you even start? We only wear 20% of our wardrobe 80% of the time, so we’re not wearing all this stuff that we are storing.” Some things may be too formal for every day wear, Fullerton concedes: “You might not want to push a trolley around Tesco wearing a ballgown. But fewer, better-quality pieces will save you time when you are choosing what to wear.”Donate to charity or sell clothes that are not needed any more, says Nick Hems, a Bath-based personal stylist for men and a tutor at the London College of Style. “When you trim down your wardrobe, it cuts out the decision fatigue. It is better for your mental health if you are looking at clothes that you like and wear, rather than stuff you’ve bought that doesn’t really suit you or make you feel good.”Make an event out of the changing seasonsIt is a good idea to put away seasonal items to avoid overcrowded rails, the stylists agree. When the weather is on the turn, pick an apt moment to swap collections over. “It sounds a bit mad, but welcome them back into your wardrobe,” says Fullerton. “Make it into a special occasion to shop your own wardrobe and reacquaint yourself with your archive. Sew any buttons back on. Give them a steam or iron. Out of sight is out of mind. When they are back in sight, you will realise that you don’t need more shorts because you’ve already got four pairs.”View image in fullscreenComposite: Guardian Design; Sviatlana Barchan/Goodboy Picture Company/Getty ImagesHang on to things – but not for too longHems advises keeping something for 18 months before passing it on if it hasn’t been worn. For Fullerton, a year is enough, “because then you would have gone through all the seasons”. She has an ingenious tip for keeping track of what you have worn: “When you put clothes in the wardrobe, turn the hanger around so the hook is facing towards you. When you wear an item, hang it the other way. Then, when you go through your wardrobe each season, if you notice anything still facing towards you, consider whether you are ever going to wear it. Challenge yourself to build it into an outfit over the next week. If you wear it, then it can regain its status in your wardrobe.” If not, it’s got to go.Figure out your greatest hitsGoing through your clothes, “think about the pieces that have made you most happy,” says Fullerton. “What you put on when you are most confident. The outfits that get the most compliments. We should be wearing things that make us feel incredible.”Mix things up“Our brains crave newness, but a new combination is as valid as a new item,” says Fullerton. She suggests “remixes” of outfits to her clients: “Why have you never worn this flowery skirt with this jacket? Or, why have you never worn that dress layered with that jumper?” This helps to “mix things up in a way that you wouldn’t have thought of, so that satiates a need, and dulls down the feeling that you are bored with all your clothes.”Blend key pieces with personalityView image in fullscreenA quirky jacket is a nice touch.Photograph: Daniel Lozano Gonzalez/Getty Images“You can have a capsule wardrobe but make sure you have some personality in there as well,” says Anna Cascarina, a Hertfordshire stylist and author ofThe Forever Wardrobe. She aims to own mainly classic items “that will transcend seasons”, such as “a tailored blazer, a pair of black wide-leg trousers, and a cashmere jumper”. She also likes to have a smaller amount of trend-led items that allow “my own personal style to come through, like a 1970s California-style fringe jacket” and lots of colour, too. Adding an unexpected item, be it something with an asymmetric hem or off-the-shoulder, “can make your look a bit more modern and a bit more you,” she says.Put on the wrong shoesIso Neville is a secondhand stylist who has not bought any new clothes since 2019, except underwear. She organisescar boot salesandflea marketsin south London where she lives. One of her favourite approaches to styling is using the “wrong shoe” method: “I first saw this with people trying to dress like Scandinavian influencers who wore trainers with everything. The premise is that if you wear a fancier dress and put a pair of trainers on, it really dresses it down.”Even on dull days, subtle updates to your outfits can kickstart spring | Jess Cartner-Morley on fashionRead moreYou can apply this more broadly with your outfits, Neville explains. “If you are wearing tracksuit bottoms with a hoodie, that is one language of style that is quite comfy. If you put a blazer over the top, that instantly dresses it up. Adding in something that is a bit smarter or a bit more casual can really change the outfit.”Don’t feel that you need to try a different look every dayDon’t be ashamed to wear the same thing often if it works, says Fullerton: “We should get joy out of wearing our favourite things, and that doesn’t mean you need to have a new outfit every day. We all turn to the formulas that we love, so wear those formulas over and over again.”Watch out for trends that you can recreate“There is a big trend for menswear and tailoring,” says Neville, “which is easy to achieve; I’m a big fan of just putting a blazer on with anything. I’m also seeing ties everywhere.”View image in fullscreenBrooches are having a moment.Photograph: Mallivan/Getty Images/iStockphotoFullerton suggests recreatingfisherman core. “Most people will have some sort of stripy top and chinos or jeans that will give a jaunty fisher feel. Adding interest to basics with a neckerchief or scarf is having a bit of a moment, too. If you don’t have a scarf, a scrap of fabric could do the same thing. The Miu Miu show this month had huge gold brooches as features on lapels. Have a look in the bottom of your jewellery box and cluster three little brooches to recreate the look.”“Satin mini dresses with a lace trim are back in,” says Cascarina, in case you have hung on to one from the 90s or have a nightdress like this. “Wear over a pair of jeans and under a jumper, so you can just see it hanging out.”Roll up your sleevesThere are very simple things you can do to make it look as though you have intentionally put together an outfit. “Even pushing your sleeves up takes your outfit from just being worn to being styled,” says Fullerton. “Tucking in your top, adding a belt, popping the collar of your shirt – all this will elevate your look.”If an item of clothing doesn’t feel quite right for you, says Neville, try wearing it a different way. “Instead of buttoning up a shirt, you could tie it at the front instead. Or you could put it on backwards, like I do sometimes, and tie it up to expose a bit of your back.”Wear bright socks“One rule for most men is: inject a bit of colour,” says Hems. “Break free of the navy blue and grey.” If you don’t feel confident in bold tones, or don’t have any to hand, “choose a bright sock to add a pop of colour,” says Fullerton. “This season’s colour isbutter yellow, so put on a pastel sock instead of a black or white one.” Cascarina adds that pinks and natural colours will also be big this season.Seek a second opinion“Most people have great clothes that are perfectly wearable,” says Fullerton, “but often you can’t see the wood for the trees in your own wardrobe, which is why it helps to have a stylist or a stylish friend or relative come in and suggest how to wear things.” Find someone to “look at what you’ve put together and say if it works”, says Hems.Look after the clothes you have“You’ve got to love and respect your clothes enough to wash them properly,” says Fullerton. “Don’t just throw them in the washing machine; follow the instructions and handwash them if necessary. Separate them into pale and bright loads, so your best white T-shirt doesn’t end up with a rogue red sock. Fold your knits, don’t hang them up, because they will lose their shape. Moth season is incoming, so make sure that everything is clean because moths are attracted to proteins in food particles and sweat particles in clothes. Get a debobbler or safety razor and some packing tape to pull bobbles off.”Make do and mendView image in fullscreenHaving a visible mend is a badge of honour.Photograph: Connect Images/Getty ImagesFix tears or holes before they become a bigger problem, says Neville: “This can be a daunting prospect. Sewing literacy is not as great as it was with my parents’ generation, but there are lots of mending cafes that are popping up, which are a good way to learn new skills.Visible mendingis also becoming a trend, so don’t feel as if everything has to be perfect and made to look as if it was never damaged. Having a visible mend is a badge of honour: it shows that you are looking after your clothes and care about longevity.”Consider an alteration“Recognise the clothes that don’t fit you well,” says Hems, and get them professionally adjusted. “Especially with trousers, take them to get altered, and the same goes for shirts and jackets where the sleeves are too long.”Challenge yourself“If I’m feeling in a bit of a rut,” says Neville, “I will try not to add things back into my wardrobe that have been in the laundry. Because people automatically go for the things that they wear every day.” Rather than reaching for her favourite items, she will “see what else I can try to wear, and incorporate those into my daily wardrobe”. Anything that still isn’t getting worn can be given away.Don’t forget to accessoriseView image in fullscreenGo bold with scarves and belts.Photograph: KoldoyChris/Getty Images“Accessories can elevate a look,” says Hems. “Switching pocket squares will instantly make it look different. Or adding a belt or watch.”Accessoriesare also a good way to introduce colour, says Cascarina. “People are frightened of wearing colour but you can add in a colourful belt, scarf or bag.”Figure out your three words“Decide onthree wordsthat best describe your style,” says Fullerton. Hers are: 60s, denim, tomboy. “This will streamline your wardrobe, because it won’t be full of stuff that you don’t feel likeyouin. You’ll be saving money, because you’re not buying stuff that isn’t going to get worn. And you’ll be saving time because you know in the mornings what your style is, what goes together, what suits you. When you have a coherent wardrobe, then everything will go together.”Accept that style evolves“Everything comes back around,” says Cascarina. “The difficult thing is that people might not have the space to keep hold of things. There have been loads of times when I’ve thought, ‘If only I’d kept that!’ Age doesn’t matter: you can wear what you want. But at the same time, our bodies change and that can be difficult to navigate. It is all about finding what your style and lifestyle is like now, and trying to change your wardrobe to fit that.”If you really need an item, consider renting or swappingView image in fullscreenPhotograph: fotoksa/Getty Images“Even with rental, you have to think about the shipping emissions, and dry-cleaning,” says Neville. “But before I would even go to the rental sites, I would consider an organised clothing swap;Loved Again Londonis one of my favourites. But I also really enjoy swapping among friends. It reduces the potential regret if you get rid of something that you later wish that you’d kept hold of. If you’ve just swapped it with a friend, you can probably get it back.”Explore more on these topicsFashionThe expertsAccessoriesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a SPRING STATEMENT, you halfwits. Everything is totally normal. This is precisely the fiscal event thatRachel Reeveshad always planned to give. Why the long faces? What could be more Labour than implementing massive welfare cuts just days before the tax rises you imposed last autumn come into effect? Just another day in Westminster.“I have full confidence in the chancellor,” Keir Starmer declared at prime minister’s questions. You couldn’t help wondering if this was the equivalent of a football club chair insisting that the manager’s job was safe just days before sacking him. There again, Keir isn’t spoilt for choice over possible replacements. Reeves looks to be by far the best qualified member of the cabinet. It probably hadn’t occurred to you that things could be even worse.There were cheers from a small section of the Labour benches as Reeves began her emer-, sorry, spring statement. These were most definitely Rachel’s fanclub. Her Useful Idiots. They would continue to cheer throughout. Even when there was nothing to cheer about. Perhaps they didn’t understand the implications of what she was saying. Large sections of the backbenches remained silent for the full half hour.Rachel Reeves does reasonable job of justifying fiscal prudence but welfare cuts cast shadowRead moreReeves began by saying Labour had been elected to bring change to the country. Yes. Sadly no one had told her that the change in question was meant to be for the better. But Rachel was not to be deterred. Everything was great, she insisted. The NHS had never been better. Interest rates were down. People had never had it so good. It wasn’t the government that needed to switch direction. It was voters who needed to re-educate themselves. Always look on the bright side of life.Then to a few caveats. The world was an uncertain place. So uncertain that there must be no mention of He Who Can Not Be Named. There was a namecheck for Vladimir Putin for his work in destabilising the world order. But nothing for Donald Trump and the threat of a trade war. That there’s a lunatic Orange Manchild in the White House. When it comes to the US, we remain very much an uncomplaining supplicant. Our role to suck up whatever is dished out. Without even the hint of a raised eyebrow.Having set the scene, Reeves moved on. Why all the fuss? There was nothing much to see here. She had only bothered to show up because she had said she would last year. But she would take the opportunity to remind everyone that her fiscal rules were non-negotiable. The country was entitled to stability. Even if that meant that the most vulnerable people in the country would have to pay for it. Someone had to. So it might as well be the scroungers.“We won’t put the public finances at risk,” she said. Only she could put growth in the economy. It was just a shame the Office of Budget Responsibility had downgraded its growth forecast to 1%. Ever since Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-budget, the OBR has acquired a not wholly deserved reputation for infallibility. I mean, anyone could have been better than Radon Liz. Even me. But now we are stuck with the OBR. Even though they are probably wrong.You just needed to learn to reprogramme your thoughts. Consider this downgrade to be a de facto upgrade. If it had been left to the Tories we would be in a recession. That was one way of looking at it, I suppose. But still not much comfort.Not even to her frontbench colleagues. As she continued to choke on the OBR’s numbers, you could see cabinet faces fall. Apart from Wes Streeting and Liz Kendall. They looked improbably chipper.Wes because he’s permanently upbeat and on message. He smiles to himself in his sleep. Liz because she’s never met a benefit cut of which she didn’t approve. Deep down she reckons that most people are scroungers at heart. She’ll be thrilled the OBR had downgraded her previous cuts and Reeves had demanded more. Though devastated she didn’t get to announce them herself. Older Labour ministers were shaking their heads at a second round of cuts in little more than a week.Next up came the wishful thinking. How Reeves managed to persuade the OBR to include £1bn of savings from tax evasion was beyond everyone. Normally this is just the kind of creative accounting that economists file under the “magic money tree”. There’s about as much chance of the government clawing back this £1bn as there is of Kemi Badenoch winning PMQs. Rachel must be a great deal more convincing in private than she is in public. Or maybe the OBR is easily flattered.We ended with a quick roundup of why all was well with the economy. It may be terrible now, but if we could just hold our nerve it would be fabulous in four years’ time. Just trust the process. And there was good news. A third world war was imminent. So we could rebuild our economy by manufacturing weapons of war. What better use of billions of pounds that could be spent elsewhere. And if some of us get killed in the conflict then so much the better. Fewer mouths to feed.It was all a bit bonkers. The world was a terrible, uncertain place but there was a narrow path to growth that was never likely to materialise because the world was a terrible, uncertain place. Understandably, by the time Reeves sat down most Labour MPs were in need of some light relief. Fortunately they had Mel Stride to deliver a few laughs to cheer them up.The best that can be said of the Melster is that he is an even less convincing shadow chancellor than Jeremy Hunt was a chancellor. He turned up with a speech full of crossings out and sentences highlighted in orange and green colour codes. Which was strange, because his immediate impact was of a man who was almost entirely clueless. There again, it didn’t help that he began by saying the Tories had left the economy in tiptop condition. Not even the Tories believe that.“What are the markets making of this?” Mel wondered. If he had cared to look, he would have seen that the pound and the FTSE were very marginally higher. Which, under the circumstances, was a huge win for Reeves. “Reeling from one fiscal event to the next is no way to run the public finances,” he continued. True. But Labour had learned this trick off the Tories.Rachel could go to bed reasonably happy. There had been no major backbench rebellions. And Stride had reminded the Commons that however bad labour were, the Tories were even worse. Just spare a thought for all those in need who are about to lose their benefits.Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesThe politics sketchHouse of CommonsBenefitsWelfarePublic financeOffice for Budget ResponsibilityEconomic policycommentShareReuse this content"

That makes Andy Kaufman particularly unusual, even this many years later: he is a comedian who worked so hard to raise questions about whether or not he was “on” that those questions lingered well after his death.The creator of characters such as Foreign Man, who would unexpectedly break into a spot-on Elvis impression; Latka Gravas, the sitcom version of that character he did for the beloved show Taxi; the grotesquely abusive lounge singer never-was Tony Clifton; and the misogynist woman-wrestling showboat named, uh, Andy Kaufman constructed so many clever hoaxes to house his work that many assumed he must not actually have died young at the age of 35. (Some of his collaborators insisted on perpetuating that illusion, though his death certificate is widely viewable.)Sex and the smackdown: the crazy world of wrestling cult comic Andy KaufmanRead moreThe newdocumentaryThank You Very Much isn’t strictly necessary to recount Kaufman’s legendary antics. He appears as a major figure in plenty of books and films, whether directly about his own life (including Man on the Moon, for which Jim Carrey inhabited Kaufman so deeply that he hadhis own Netflix documentaryabout his process) or chronicling the institutions he touched along the way (like just about any book covering the history ofSaturday Night Live). Just last fall, Nicholas Braun joined Carrey in playing Kaufman onthe big screen; he recreated the comedian’s famous Mighty Mouse bit, where Kaufman timidly puts on a recording of the Mighty Mouse theme song and gathers the nerve to lip-sync along with a single line, as it appeared on the premiere episode of SNL.What Alex Braverman’s film tackles is the comprehensiveness of the Kaufman project, placing it in a proper and personal context. Kaufman, a longtime practitioner of transcendental meditation, seemed to find a form of spiritual enlightenment in his commitment as a comedian, and clearly put a lot of thought into this aspect of his work. (There’s even footage of a young Kaufman asking Maharishi Mahesh Yogi whether achieving a kind of inner peace would eliminate the need for entertainment and entertainers.) Perhaps more so than the entertaining but somewhat conventional Carrey-starring biopic, Thank You Very Much is also upfront about how alienating Kaufman could be – to audience members, to casual observers, even to co-workers – while at the same time never framing his work as pure endurance tests. There’s an evident glee in his blurring the lines between reality and fiction, even when he does his best to hide it under voices or makeup.Thank You Very Much doesn’t depend on the same old clips, and watching all of this Kaufman footage emphasizes how inimitable the man was. Eventually, his performance-art take on comedy does start to reveal some descendants, if somewhat superficial ones. Kaufman’s Foreign Man shtick feels like it might have influenced earlyAdam Sandler, when his bizarre little voices and bursts of nonsense might have made audiences wonder if this is a near-amateur or a polished professional having a laugh (and in a way, it was both, though even early on, Sandler would give himself away with endearing little breaks in the facade). The later work of Tim Heidecker, where he plays “himself” in the ongoing (and weirdly intricate) On Cinema series and in a standup special that spoofs hacky comics by convincingly performing a certain type of familiar routine, has a clear Kaufman influence as well; it similarly requires more than passive consumption in order to fully appreciate the joke.View image in fullscreenAndy Kaufman performs on stage in 1978.Photograph: Paul Natkin/Getty ImagesWhat’s more difficult to replicate is Kaufman’s dedication to his strangest whims. (When Tim Heidecker passes away, it will probably not kick off a 30-year ambiguity over whether he’s genuinely dead.) The closest we have to that is something weirder and scarier, a kind of inverse to Kaufman’s thoughtful deception. In place of comedians who prompt the audience to wonder whether or not to take him at face value, it is far more common to see comedians who prod their audience to question the very nature of reality around them, but with comedians as their truth-telling, regular folks, and essentially trustworthy guides. The most obvious example, of course, is Joe Rogan, who “admits” to not being an expert while using his approachability to steer his audience in the direction of rejecting medical science or promoting baseless conspiracy theories. But the flipping of Kaufman’s brilliant gambits, where uncertainty about reality remains but the comedian is your trusted guide through that uncertainty, could apply to any number of comedians who cultivate parasocial relationships with their loyal listeners. It’s like a lazy man’s version of Kaufman: all the questioning, none of the performance.This allows the comedian to risk little while amassing followers; Kaufman repeatedly risked his reputation – as well as whatever following he had gathered from Taxi or SNL. It’s wild to consider that in 1982, Kaufman participated in a bit on SNL that had audience members calling in to decide whether he would continue to pop up on the show. He lost the vote, appeared once more, never again – despite the fact that some of his colleagues in the doc claim that he was double-crossed by producer Dick Ebersol, who had grown tired of his antics. You’d never know either away from Kaufman himself. Today, it’s far more common for comedians to simply court a persecution complex.There’s a lovely clip showcased in Thank You Very Much where Kaufman offers a rare reassurance to his audience: “Don’t be afraid of what you don’t know.” Today, that kind of mantra might have an entirely different meaning, used to promote a false sense of expertise from entertainers: don’t hesitate to speak up about topics you know less than nothing about! Given that, the way Kaufman was able to use the unknown as the existential engine of his entire career now seems all the more miraculous.Thank You Very Much is out in US cinemas on 28 March with a UK date to be announcedExplore more on these topicsComedyDocumentary filmsSaturday Night LiveTV comedyTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The two events might not seem to be connected. But Réard, who had been looking for a name for his design that would embody the tiniest garment imaginable, combined with the most explosive impact possible, hit on the almighty atomic blast as the ideal symbol. And so the modern bikini was born.The world’s first bikininow hangs on a mannequin in the Design Museum in London, looking decidedly less earth-shattering than it did back then. Formed from baggy triangles of pink fabric, printed with a newspaper pattern and tied together with string, it looks a bit like someone has fashioned a quick cossie out of a few pages of the FT.A two-piece isn't a genuine bikini unless it can be pulled through a wedding ring1962 advert for men’s swimming shorts“It was really controversial at the time,” says fashion historian Amber Butchart, curator of Splash! A Century ofSwimmingand Style. “Swimsuits were getting smaller and smaller in a kind of arms race, tied up with the excitement of the atomic age.”Two months earlier, another French fashion designer, Jacques Heim, had unveiled his own two-piece swimsuit at his beach shop in Cannes. He christened it the Atome, after the particle of matter, and hired skywriting aircraft to advertise “the world’s smallest bathing suit” over the Mediterranean. Not to be outdone, Réard hired his own skywriters to fly over the French Riviera, announcing his bikini to be “smaller than the smallest bathing suit in the world”.View image in fullscreenBaggy triangles … the world’s first bikini.Photograph: Luke HayesIt was the first time a swimming costume had plunged below the navel, to the horror of the Catholic church, and the glee of the male gaze. Réard was quick to capitalise on its minimalist credentials. Long before the arrival of the microkini, he published adverts declaring that a two-piece suit wasn’t a genuine bikini “unless it could be pulled through a wedding ring”.The competitive shrinkage of swimwear is one of many stories threaded throughout this illuminating exhibition, which charts our enduring relationship with water over the last 100 years, across fashion, architecture, sport and more. It touches on the British love of lidos, the lure of the seaside and the rise of wild swimming, as well as delving into more niche topics, from the controversies around hi-tech performance swimwear, to the curiousMermaidcore trend of the 2020s. Theinexplicable popularity of the Dryrobeas an item of everyday clothing gets a look-in too.As unlikely as the towel-lined changing gown becoming an acceptable thing to wear to the shops, the atomic-bikini period is one of the stranger moments in the history of the swimwear-industrial complex. Displayed next to the first bikini, a 1950s photo shows people lounging beside a hotel pool in Las Vegas, as a mushroom cloud erupts on the horizon.Another shot depicts a poolside showgirl wearing a jaunty mushroom cloud headpiece. It turns out that the nearby Nevada Test Site made the area a hotspot for “atomic tourism”, with Vegas casinos offering atomic-themed cocktails and Miss Atomic Bomb pageants – where evermore skimpy bikinis were naturally all the rage.View image in fullscreenSmuggle that budgie … trunks on display in the show.Photograph: Luke HayesKeen not to be left out of the scanty swimwear craze, men soon got in on the action. One vitrine is dedicated to the furtive rise of gay men’s swimming attire, at a time when homosexuality was still illegal. Raunchy “physique” magazines of the 1950s and 60s, ostensibly marketed as male health and fitness publications, doubled up as softcore porn, featuring adverts for mail-order posing pouches and revealing trunks.“You’ll be number one,” promises an ad for a tiny pair of shorts with strategic windows cut out of the sides, published in a 1962 issue of The Young Physique, “when the gang gets a glimpse of you thru porthole cutouts.” Who could resist the “skintight muscle-conforming knit” of the latest “Orlon-Wool-Rubber” blend? Available in alligator skin vinyl, too.Such technical material innovation is probed further in the evolution of high performance Olympic swimwear, most contentiously in the form of the2008 LZR Racer swimsuit. Developed by Speedo, in collaboration with Nasa scientists, the futuristic garment looks like something from Batman’s wardrobe. It was made from ultrasonically welded low-friction fabric to repel water, with compression panels for streamlining, as well as trapping air for increased buoyancy.View image in fullscreenMushroom cloud on top … showgirl Linda Lawson poses in a 1950s number.Photograph: University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Special Collections and Archives.The full body-length design instantly saw countless world records shattered: 94% of the gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Olympics were won by swimmers wearing the sleek suit. The international swimming federation, Fina, was furious, declaring that the level of innovation amounted to “technical doping”. It was one step of ingenious design too far, and was swiftly banned.Perhaps in future contests, athletes should all be forced to compete in the standard issue grey woollen onesie that used to be rented out to day-tripping bathers by the municipal Margate Corporation in the 1920s. In the days before most people had their own swimming costume, its unisex one-size-fits-all design ensured it could fit swimmers of all body shapes.A century later, the exhibition shows how similar design principles are being embraced today, in the re-emergence of gender-neutral swimwear, created by companies such as the Portland, Oregon-basedBeefcake. Its one-piece swimsuits, “for any body, anywhere”, take inspiration from the classic costumes of the 1920s, with sizes ranging from XS to 5XL, made in small batches by people in Portland making a living wage.View image in fullscreenIn collaboration with Nasa … the contentious Speedo LZR Racer.Photograph: AlamyBeefcake’s Dreamboat design is shown alongside other efforts to make swimming more inclusive. There isRebirth Garments’trans-friendly kit – which includes a compression lining in the bottom half to suit a trans woman, transfemme or non-binary person – and elegant unilateral mastectomy swimwear by Eno for single-breasted people.TheBlob swimsuit, meanwhile, was designed by Hannah Whelanas a piece of “artivism” to open up conversations around menstruation, period stigma and swimming, with a bright red patch emblazoned on its crotch.There are plenty more design stories to discover. Along with the actual red costume worn by Pamela Anderson in BayWatch, there’s a celebration of the reinvention of Penzance’s 1930s Jubilee seawater pool,recently upgraded with geothermal baths by Scott Whitby Studio, who were also responsible for the exhibition’s punchy design, drenched with bold, kiss-me-quick colours.Marvel, too, at the evolution of goggles – including a 1940s guide to making your own wooden Hawaiian diving variety – and ponder the unlikely high-fashion adoption of pool slides worn with socks, thanks to a 1990s Tommy Hilfiger campaign.Diver Tom Daley also features with his Made With Love knitting kits, as does the recent revival of budgie-smuggler briefs, for which he is partly responsible. We’ve come a long way since2009, when Alton Towers banned Speedos, in an apparent attempt “to maintain the family-friendly atmosphere at the resort”.View image in fullscreenBeach ready … Splash!

One such scaly pink fin – made by special effects designer Silvo Dordevic,AKA Siki Red– hangs momentously from the ceiling, as an example of the subcultural phenomenon of Mermaiding.The TikTok trend, which sees people dressing up and swimming as merfolk – and greeting each other with a cheery “shello!” – has been fuelled by the live action remake of The Little Mermaid, and the Netflix series MerPeople, both released in 2023. Mermaid academies can now be found from Bournemouth to Boracay island in the Philippines. It might look like child’s play, but it’s not for the fainthearted.London’s Design Museum takes a deep dive into our love affair with swimmingRead more“It’s one of the most physically uncomfortable situations you can ever be in,”according to Morgana Alba, founder of mermaid group, Circus Siren Pod. “You can’t breathe. You can’t see. You can’t really hear. You’re probably cold. And the tail is dragging you down.” On a basic human level, “our bodies don’t want to be under those conditions”.So, perfect for the next extreme fitness trend!

Those were the words that were thrown at me in my 20s … It wasn’t even an insult. It was just who I was.”The man speaking has a handsome, sensitive face. His eyes look soulful – not like those of someone dead inside. But then, Ben Bidwell has broken free from his past, and now helps other men do the same.“I had no intention of disconnecting from emotion or closing myself off – I just lived in a society that grabbed me and did its thing and took me down that road,” Bidwell says.Enlightenment came via a hypnotherapist. Bidwell had anorgasmia, a difficulty in achieving orgasm, and sought help for the condition. “I wasn’t looking to change. I was just intrigued to see if I could enhance my sexual experiences,” he writes on his website. But the hypnotherapist showed him that pursuing “financial success and female adoration” were bringing no fulfilment.The revelation that money and sex aren’t everything sounds trite, but for Bidwell it was huge.Now, Bidwell is a self-described “human potential coach” who focuses on masculinity and men’s mental health, promising men a life of wellbeing and emotional fulfilment.View image in fullscreenBen Bidwell: ‘If we offer men the opportunity to be better, it will reach more of them.’Photograph: Ben Bidwell“I came out of the military after 10 years. I was 26, and I was dead. I was a zombie. I couldn’t feel anything.”It’s probably no coincidence thatBryan Reevesuses similar language to Bidwell when describing his past. Reeves, a “life and relationship insight ninja”, also charts his journey from emotionally stunted high achiever – US air force captain turned successful businessman – to a contented “spiritual warrior” helping men become their best selves.Reeves and Bidwell are part of the growing life coaching industry, helping men deal with the emotional pain and dissatisfaction themanosphere–misogynistic online communitiesand their influencers – has successfully identified and exploited to monetise an anti-feminist message.Life coaching is unregulated and has no governing body or set of ethical standards. Anyone can call themselves a life coach and no specific requirements are needed, although many institutions now offer a range of courses. Unlike therapists, coaches do not offer advice on clinical conditions such as anxiety or depression but help clients lead more satisfactory lives.Reeves and Bidwell are not short of customers. The demand for their services shows that men are in search of guidance on everything from relationships to careers. The market research company IBISWorld estimated that coaching was a $2.1bn industry in the US, and more and more men arecustomers. Both coaches feel that men are feeling lost, and evidence supports this theory. The pandemic has exacerbated an already growing crisis of male connection: in the US, the number of men who had six or more close friendshalvedbetween 1990 and 2021, a phenomenon that particularly affected single men.This has been blamed on a complex set of factors, from socio-economic and work pattern changes to the decline of traditional community structures – as well as dominant masculinity norms, which don’t encourage men to nurture friendships with other men into adulthood. In the UK, research by Movemberfoundthat a quarter of British men had no close friends.As their friendships have declined, men have found networks on digital platforms. The 2023 State of American Men report by the gender equality organisation Equimundofoundthat nearly half of the men polled considered their online lives more rewarding than their offline lives and that only 22% had three or more close connections in their local area that they could depend on. Forty per cent of respondents said they trusted one or more figures from the manosphere; for young men, the proportion was almost half.Male malaise and moral panics about the disappearance of men are not new. The postwar period was marked by anxious discussion about allegedly declining masculinity both in Europe and in North America. These days, plenty of airtime is devoted to what ails men, and the “crisis of masculinity”regularlyfeaturesin media headlines.In his book Of Boys and Men(2022),Richard Reeves(no relation to Bryan), a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has documented the ways in which young men, particularly in the US, are struggling. At the end of 2023, Reeves launched the American Institute for Boys and Men, a thinktank that conducts research on and runs programmes to improve men’s wellbeing andhas received$20m in financial backing from the Melinda Gates Foundation.Society is so quick to judge the behaviour without understanding where the behaviour might have come fromBen BidwellAccording to Reeves, men are threatened with “cultural redundancy” – falling behind in education, dropping out of the workforce, and failing as fathers. These shifts feed their feelings of irrelevance, and there is no consensus about what a healthy model of masculinity looks like.By most metrics, men as a class, particularly straight white men, are doing OK.Menstill out-earn women significantly and dominate political leadership. Yet in an era in which societal norms have changed rapidly, many men do feel adrift, a change partly driven by socio-economic factors and the decline of manufacturing jobs in favour of services-based roles, some of which men are reluctant to take. While men at the top continue to thrive, others are struggling with “aggrieved entitlement” – a term coined by the sociologist Michael Kimmel to describe the wounded feelings of a person who feels entitled to something and fails to receive it.Reevesand othershave rightly cautioned against confusing the success of a handful of powerful men and the broad trend with the lived experience of the many young men whose status is less rarefied. A minority may be thriving, but countless men are suffering and need attention, so the argument goes.This sits uneasily with some progressives and feminists. In the face of persistent gender inequality and continued violence against women, there is understandable reticence about paying attention to men’s problems. Many feminists rightly argue that it is not women’s job to “fix men”. Figures like Bryan Reeves and Ben Bidwell fill a need: they are men that other men can turn to.By addressing male distress and insecurity, however, they share space with Pickup Artists (PUAs) – misogynistic dating coaches – and red-pilled influencers of all kinds, such as Myron Gaines, co-host of the dating podcast Fresh and Fit, who regularly calls women “hoes” andpromisesto “help men transform from simps to PIMPS”. Or Rollo Tomassi, founder of the life and relationship advice website The Rational Male, whoarguesthat “[men] coddle and cater to the feminine”.Like their manosphere counterparts, Bidwell and Reeves run courses aimed at fulfilling men’s desires. “I help you create the life and love you deserve,” promises Reeves on his website. “Turn your biggest dreams into everyday reality … Attract (& keep) an amazing romantic partner.”They address the same fears the manosphere exploits but offer an alternative to anger and grievance with self-improvement and personal responsibility. Attractive and successful – Bidwell once gained social media traction by posting naked pictures of himself to promotehealthier masculinity– they are able to gain the respect of clients who might otherwise seek inspiration elsewhere.Their charisma is essential to their appeal. Derek Beres, a writer and fitness instructor based in Portland, Oregon, and co-host of the Conspirituality podcast, has been documenting the influencer phenomenon for years and has seen the manosphere’s ideas spread in the wellness world.Beres believes misogynistic influencers who project an image of strength, likeAndrew Tate, can be appealing to men in search of control: “Some people really like him because he is strong and big, but he also just says whatever is on his mind. If I was a teenager growing up right now, I can understand being drawn to that, because he exudes confidence.”View image in fullscreenBryan Reeves: ‘A lot of men when they first discover my work, they get angry.’Photograph: David TostiBidwell avoids directly talking about the manosphere – both in his work and our conversation. But Reeves positions himself more openly as an alternative to it. “I’ve always been suspicious of that community,” he says. “These guys – they know how to get the girl, but they have no idea how to have a healthy relationship.”Earlier in the pandemic, Reeves became estranged from his father, who started getting into QAnon. The more misogynist strain of masculinity “quickly veers into conspiratorial thinking, and I have sympathy for that”, he says. “Not for those beliefs, but I understand what it is to go down the rabbit hole. At the heart of it, it’s appealing because it tells you that ‘Oh, well, it’s not your fault. It’s feminists and progressives and other people out there that are out to get you.’”Bidwell, too, knows he is speaking to men who might be tempted by misogynistic influencers. Marketing advisers have encouraged him to parrot the language of the manosphere and tell men what they want to hear in order to accrue clients – “telling them what they think they need and then giving them what they really need”.“If we tell people they’re wrong and they can’t see it, there’s going to be resistance,” he says. “Some might be open to it but the majority will push back, whereas if we offer men the opportunity to be better, it will reach more of them.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reeves runs relationship coaching for couples and a programme for men that teaches relationship skills and involves talking about relationship struggles in the presence of other men.“These are fighter pilots, lawyers, business owners, first responders, construction workers who just met other dudes and they are coming together to discuss their relationships, and not in a way that is cynical, mean-spirited or dismissive,” Reeves says. One of the most rewarding aspects of coaching, he says, is helping men gain awareness of women’s experiences. “I’m able to help men understand what women experience daily – the lack of safety, for example – that men don’t feel,” he says.Some clients struggle with Reeves’s approach. “A lot of men when they first discover my work, they get angry,” he says. “I think a lot of men are still caught up in that victim mentality: ‘I’m the victim here – it’s women’s fault. I’m the one that means well, I’m the one that has good intentions. If you would just listen to me and see it my way, everything would be OK.’”Men don’t grow up with older consistent male role models in their lives, men tend to see other men as competition or threatNeal AllistoneWhen Reeves tells clients they have a responsibility for their actions, they can be resistant. “It is confronting to men that they are not absolved of the responsibility that we have for our impact on others. And I think a lot of men, at first, are not ready to accept that,” he says.But others are ready. “Often it is a relationship with a woman that has brought them to me, because they have finally come to the realisation: ‘I don’t know what I’m doing, I am clueless, and I want things to be different. And I don’t want to lose this woman, or I have already lost her, and I’m starting to see my part in why it happened.’”For some men, a coach may be the first opportunity to discuss emotions with another man. “I had a dad, but not one who necessarily showed me the healthy aspects of masculinity,” Bidwell says. “He came out of the second world war, and at that time, there wasn’t space to be open to being vulnerable. It was important at that point for him to grin and bear it. There are a huge number of men who grew up with fathers like that: dads who are there, but who aren’t actually offering any guidance. Society is so quick to judge the behaviour without understanding where the behaviour might have come from.”Imeet Neal Allistone outside a pub on the English south coast on a late summer afternoon. A former business analyst and police intelligence officer, Allistone also has a background of stereotypically “manly” life experience and career success. He works for A Band of Brothers, a UK charity that offers mentoring – the oldest volunteer is 82 – to young men at risk of falling into the criminal justice system. For the past few years, he has also worked with men in prison, in child custody proceedings or going through adoption.A Band of Brothers is free and community-based, catering to the working-class and marginalised men that expensive programmes rarely reach.“I was baptised Methodist as a child, and then I hit my 20s and I joined a Buddhist monastery,” Allistone says. When living in Ukraine, he was baptised as Russian Orthodox, but he no longer agrees with organised religion.Yet Allistone laments the decline of the community ties that church, mosque, synagogue or temple used to bring.“We come from the point of view that community is dying, men don’t hang out with men any more, men don’t grow up with older consistent male role models in their lives, men tend to see other men as competition or threat,” he says. The young men he works with are at higher risk of loneliness, and since the pandemic Allistone says he has seen their feelings of isolation increase.Using terms like toxic masculinity is not helpfulBryan ReevesA Band of Brothers offers a one-to-one mentoring programme supporting men with mental health, money, addiction and relationships – but not romantic ones. Allistone is keen to stress that the organisation focuses on friendship and community relations and actively encourages men to develop support networks.A key element of the programme is the “rite of passage” weekend. It resembles the kind ofprivate retreats for menwhich have boomed in recent years – though stripped of the wellness elements and price tag. It involves a weekend of camping in the wilderness without technology or contact with the outside world. Mentees build a camp from scratch and are asked to share their darkest fears and confront their vulnerabilities.Allistone says the weekend is cathartic but not a long-term solution: “The guys ride out of that weekend on a high and feel fixed. We tell them that they will come down from that high, but by then their relationship with the mentor has been cemented and they have started experiencing community. And it’s a long, long journey – it takes years, you know, doing the work and revisiting and looking back at it to make changes.”The men Allistone mentors love the manosphere’s influencers and podcasts. The day before we meet, one of his mentees sent him a video titled “The CONSEQUENCES Of FEMINISM In Modern DATING”, a YouTube video from Whatever, another manosphere dating podcast. Fresh and Fitis popular, and most of the men have read 12 Rules for Life, the Canadian psychologistJordan Peterson’s2018 bestselling self-help book.Allistone and his colleagues deal with content from charismatic influencers by “putting the question back to the men, saying, ‘So what is it you’re trying to say here? What does it do to you?’”How much these coaches can compete with their counterparts in the manosphere is open to question. “If you have 100,000 followers on Instagram, and you’re able to make a living by coaching a small number of people, that’s still nothing compared to 11 million people per download for an episode of [Joe Rogan’s podcast],” says Beres, the Conspirituality co-host.The American Association of Psychologists describes “traditional masculinity ideology” as harmful to men and associated with negative health outcomes. But many men resist engaging with critiques of it.“Using terms like toxic masculinity is not helpful,” says Reeves. “I understand it, but many men hear an attack on masculinity itself, so I think messaging is very important. I do believe it has to be approached delicately, if we’re going to make any movement forward.”Men’s coaches understand the significance of human contact and community in addressing men’s feelings of insecurity, and they know how to communicate with men who might otherwise be attracted to violent and coercive belief systems. And they do make a difference. Allistone ends our drink with a story of a man he worked with who had just come out of prison.“He’d done 14 years inside. He wasn’t allowed to be anywhere near children or anything at all because of the level of violence that had been in his life. I worked with him for a year, and he’s now got a wife, and her child that was taken and put into care has come back, so he’s raising a stepson. And they’re doing amazingly. They’ve got a little business that they’re working on together and every now and then he sends me texts and pictures of his kid and tells me how they’re doing. And it’s lovely to hear stories like that. Our successes have gone away and been able to live fulfilling, independent lives.”Adapted fromCtrl, Hate, Delete: The New Anti-Feminist Backlash and How We Fight Itby Cécile SimmonsExplore more on these topicsWell actuallyMenAndrew TateMental healthJordan PetersonWomenSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

About £100bn worth of wind, solar and nuclear energy, with the rebuilt grid, will carry electricity to the projects coming on stream. The Office for Budget Responsibility confirms 1.3m new homes are possible – “within touching distance” of the manifesto’s 1.5m target, as Rachel Reeves put it. The massive shift into defence engineering, investing in skills, promises good jobs where they are needed most, from Thanet to Sunderland. Everything from now on depends on getting spades in the ground fast enough for this unprecedented capital investment. The OBR,halving growth this year, scores it a higher upgrade every year afterwards, promising £500 more in people’s pockets by the next election.But investing in warfare with money stolen from welfare will never be forgotten or forgiven. Wheelchairs beaten into armaments will be an abiding image that may stay with this government. Even if promises to take children out of poverty are fulfilled when the poverty review reports in the summer, even if people feel better with wages rising faster than inflation and a7% minimum wage raise in April, the stories of brutal losses further hitting people on personal independence payments will define Labour.No new taxes, the chancellor said. That was the choice Labour made. Tax reliefs for the well off stayed untouched, mega-millionaires untroubled, no taking back thenational insurance cutthe Tories gave away in a failed pre-election tax bribe. It’s technically not austerity, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies about overall spending – but it will feel austere in most public services.People know this new dangerous era needs emergency defence spending: this is a time when the nation could be asked to contribute to its security.Balancing the books at the cost of sick and disabled peopleAnna LandreDisability justice activist and researcherIn the spring statement, Rachel Reeves said “the Labour party is the party of work”.But for those too sick or disabled to work, Labour has chosen their backs on which to balance the public finances. After feedback from the Office for Budget Responsibility that the first round of cuts did not go far enough to bring down public spending, the chancellor has made changes that would save £3.4bn in total. The universal credit health element will be cut for new claimants and then frozen. According to the government’s official assessment, families will lose an average of £1,720 a year. An extra 250,000 people will be pushed into relative poverty by 2029-30, including 50,000 children.And what of disabled people who wish to work? The pledge to put £1bn into job support for people is a positive – though it remains to be seen how much this will help disabled people specifically, with anine-month waitfor the Access to Work scheme that forces many disabled people out of their jobs. Labour has promised fewer assessments for disability benefits, but the reform leaves out most redundant assessments disabled people face in other parts of government. Why not create a more efficient, joined-up system?Disabled people already in work will see changes to the eligibility threshold to personal independence payment (Pip, which is not an out-of-work benefit) that may push them out of employment. Many use it to cover the extra costs of working with a disability, such as buying assistive devices or paying for taxis. (It is worth noting that this government seems to havescrappedthe pledge to put accessibility at the heart of new rail policy.)Cutting Pip eligibility will also cause appeals to soar, offsetting any savings this government hopes for. (Last year, the DWPspent £50mon Pip appeals.) The Disability Policy Centre has also forecast £1.2bn inadditional coststo the NHS and other services.Will Labour’s give and take enable more disabled people to work or fewer? Right now, it seems poised to cost more than it saves.From a green superpower to a defence superpower – this is a betrayalFatima IbrahimCo-founder and co-director of Green New Deal RisingThis spring statement is an assault on our generation’s future. From a “clean energy superpower”, as Keir Starmer once put it, to the “defence industrial superpower” Reeves spoke about today, the rhetoric of this government has shifted dramatically since the election.Labour surged in the polls talking about a greener fairer future, and they were elected on a platform that promised green jobs, warm homes, cheaper bills, and GB Energy – one of the few flagship policies they consistently pushed, and one that remains popular with voters.But since coming into power, its talk of “growing the economy” has involved sweeping cuts hurting those who need support most, and a hawkish obsession with the defence sector, with an extra £2.2bn for the Ministry of Defence. People want to see investment in industries that will create jobs and cut bills. The renewable energy sector can do both, unlike building more tanks and weapons.Labour was right to put green policies at the heart of its original plans for growth. The green economy grew by 10% in 2024,generating £83bn. So if this government is serious about growth, why are they not investing properly in its strongest, most sustainable pathway? And why isn’t it considering other fairer ways to generate the money we need, such as taxing wealth?Where are the tax rises for people like me?Julia DaviesJulia Davies is a millionaire investor, lawyer and a member of Patriotic MillionairesIt’s incredibly disappointing that while repeating that the government is on the side of working people, the chancellor has in fact delivered to them another financial blow.The chancellor said: “We can’t tax and spend our way to prosperity”, minutes after confirming welfare and aid cuts. We cannot cut our way to prosperity either. Many disabled and vulnerable people are now living in fear. Meanwhile, patriotic millionaires like me – the people with the broadest shoulders – are telling MPs we can and should contribute more.We need to tax the super rich. While it’s good news that the government plans to invest more in HMRC and crack down on tax evasion, it’s simply not enough. A tax of just 2% on assets over £10m would alone raise£460m a weekand would affect only 0.04% of the population. Based on recent statements none of us expected that reform today, but we’ll be looking to the autumn budget for more ambition, as the country can’t afford to wait.The chancellor claims people will be £500 a year better off from 2029. It’s not good enough – the British people need a better deal right now. Seven in 10 millionaires and three quarters of the publicsupport higher taxes on wealth– as do many MPs. If the chancellor really does want a stronger economy, she needs to get serious about fairly taxing wealth.Labour’s problem runs much deeper than the fiscal rulesJonathan PortesProfessor of economics and public policy at King’s College London and a former senior civil servantBlame Tony Benn. The requirement for the government to publish at leasttwo official economic forecasts each year, enshrined in his 1975 Industry Act, has collided with the chancellor’s commitment that those forecasts be consistent with her fiscal rules. Without that we wouldn’t really need a spring statement all.The government has promised a spending review, an industrial strategy and an immigration white paper, all to come, not to mention a reset of our relationship with the EU. After that we will know the policy specifics behind the government’s strategy. Meanwhile, largely outside our control, we will also get a much better idea of just how much damageMaganomicswill do.So it would have been far better to wait until October and look at tax and spending in the round. Instead, alongside some really positive improvements to help support people into work, the government has hastily thrown together a package of cuts to disability benefits to “balance the books”. The problem isn’t the fiscal rules themselves,although the need to get within their lines twice a year is unnecessary. Ultimately,the constraint that government should balance tax and spending over the medium to long term, while borrowing to invest, can’t really be dodged, rules or no rules.By October the numbers will have shifted again, but the basic challenge will remain the same: how to restore productivity growth and improve living standards, while repairing Britain’s public services and addressing what should in any civilised society be unacceptable levels of poverty and destitution, all in the face of an ageing population. There is some genuinely good news in today’s statement – on planning reform, further increases to capital investment, and on training. But more will be required – not just higher taxes, but major tax reforms, and willingness to take some difficult political decisions on social care, immigration, EU relations and much more.Civil servants want reform – but not like thisMike ClancyGeneral secretary of the Prospect trade unionCivil service reform was one of the key themes of this spring statement, with a series of interventions by ministers culminating in the announcement of a target for a15% reduction in civil service administrationspending. Some of the reforms are very welcome, but there is a real danger that a positive agenda for change is being overtaken by the desire to find savings.A pledge to double the number of data and digital specialists is long overdue, and will help to modernise public service delivery and free up civil service time for more specialist work. The creation of a transformation fund allowing departments to bid for resources to, for example, overhaul outdated systems is a step in the right direction.But all of this comes in the context of the desire tosave £2.2bn from the civil serviceadministration budget and to reduce the rate of spending increases in departmental budgets. This funding doesn’t just cover “back room” functions, it covers a variety of roles in the civil service including scientists, policy officers and whole departments, including the Treasury.Reform requires investment in people and technology. Starting with a savings target, rather than a clear sense of what the civil service needs to deliver, is the wrong way to implement a programme of change and risks resulting in a disjointed approach that weakens rather than strengthens the civil service.Labour may have backed away from blunt headcount targets and the divisive language of the last government, but some of the words used about public servants and briefings about “project chainsaw” have caused serious relationship damage. If the government wants civil servants to be partners in reform, then it needs to work hard to rebuild this trust.Cutting aid will make Britain less secureDhananjayan SriskandarajahChief executive of the New Economics Foundation and author of Power to the PeopleOf all the choices that lie behind today’s spring statement the one I find most heartbreaking and wrongheaded is the choice to cut aid, as expected, to fund increased defence spending. On a day like this, my mind goes to the clinic for malnourished children I saw in Somalia or the programme to provide clean water in war-stricken Yemen. These are the sorts of life-saving programmes that will shut down as international development budgets are slashed to their lowest levels since records began in 1979,according to one estimate.A party elected on a manifesto pledge to“turn the page to rebuild Britain’s reputation on international development”has shown today that it is turning its back not just on the world’s poorest but also Britain’s strategic interests. If Rachel Reeves really wants to secure Britain’s interests she needs to see diplomacy, development and defence as complementary not competing approaches. Hard and soft power work together.In our rush to become a “defence industrial superpower”, Reeves has even added £2bn of UK Export Finance to help foreign buyers of British-made weapons to take out loans. That may help grow our economy a bit, but it won’t necessarily make the world a safer place. Meanwhile, cutting aid undermines our ability to stabilise fragile states and manage forced migration, reduces our ability to strike alliances that enhance national security, and cedes the ground to emerging powers such as China – including to pursue business and commercial interests that will be critical for Reeves’s search for growth. Like so much in today’s statement, what may seem like savings in the short term will have huge human and strategic costs in the long term.Explore more on these topicsSpring statement 2025The panelBudgetTaxTax and spendingEconomic policycommentShareReuse this content"

TV series such asAdolescence, media attention tosexist “manfluencers”like Andrew Tate, and community concern about“toxic masculinity”all raise the question of how to raise good boys and men.What can parents do to help raise boys who will become positive members of their community, men who treat the people around them with respect and fairness?‘Real’ men: how are masculine norms changing?For parents to be part of the solution, we first have to learn a little about the problem.“Masculinity”refers to the set of behaviours and roles associated with being a boy or a man. Traditional norms of masculinity tell males that they should be tough, aggressive, risk-taking, stoic, heterosexual, homophobic, emotionally constipated, hostile to femininity and dominant. These stereotypical expectationshave weakened in Australia in recent decades. There are growing emphases on male emotional expressiveness and nurturant fathering, a blurring of the boundaries between straight and gay, and increasing acceptance of the ideal of gender equality.Adolescence, the backlash: the nightmare of making hit TV in terrifying timesRead moreTraditional masculine norms do, though, still shape boys’ and men’s lives. Forabout one-fifth of boys and young men, strong endorsement of stereotypical manhood plays out in behaviours that harm themselves or harm others. Some young men face harm to themselves: they lack close friendships and support, consider suicide, take risks while drunk or high, or drive dangerously. Conforming to some aspects of traditional definitions of manhood can also bring rewards, such as success at work or status in male peer groups.More widely, boys and young men in general experience “gender policing”, efforts by others to encourage behaviour in line with influential norms of gender and to punish behaviour that strays away from these, including through verbal and physical abuse. This policing comes particularly from male peers, and parents, but also others.Boys and men who do not conform to dominant models of masculinity, whether because they are unable or unwilling to do so, pay a particular cost. They may suffer violence, abuse, marginalisation or stigma.Some boys and young men harm others. Most would never use violence against a girlfriend or other girl or woman. But a minority – again, a larger minority than many parents want to recognise – do perpetrate violence, particularly those who agree most with sexist norms of disrespect and male dominance.Australian data tells usthat most young men support gender equality and most reject violence, dominance and control in relationships. But a minority – one-quarter to one-third, depending on the issue –do endorse aspects of sexism. And although the evidence is only anecdotal, it is possible that we are seeing an increase in more hostile, misogynist forms of sexism among some cohorts of boys, whether prompted by pornography, anti-feminist social influencers, or something else.There is also profound diversity among boys and young men. Different groups have very different levels of access to resources, power and status, because of other social inequalities, depending on their economic position, ethnicity and other factors.How do we raise good men?It is not fair to look only to parents to address the harms that boys and young men suffer and cause, when schools, social media platforms, governments and communities can play a role. Still, parents can be powerful influences on the kinds of men their boys will become.Parents can encourage strong norms of gender equity among their children, model shared decision-making andchallenge rigid gender roles and stereotypes. Parents can encourage empathy and kindness. We can teach our sons how to deal safely with anger and aggression, developing their emotional intelligence or literacy.Parents can ask boys about how they want to be seen and about the values and morals they aspire to live by, to help motivate them to invest in positive ways of being. Talk to sons about the messages about manhood they notice in media, music and elsewhere. What is positive about them and what is negative, sexist or limiting? Note the value of some stereotypically masculine qualities, such as courage, leadership and strength, and of stereotypically feminine traits such as caring and empathy, and how these can be put into practice.Young people: share your thoughts on the Netflix show AdolescenceRead moreWith teenage boys, parents shouldtalk about sexual consent, rape and healthy relationshipsas part of regular chats about life, love and growing up. Talk to them about positive, pleasurable sexual involvements and relationships, noting that these are based on consent and mutual respect. Show boys that men can be considerate lovers and loving husbands and partners.Fathers can play vital roles, given the evidence thatsons learn their models of masculinity particularly from their dads. Try to provide a positive example, to “walk the walk”. Be a fair and supportive partner. Inspire your kids with a sense of fairness and respect. And when you get it wrong, as all of us will at times, acknowledge your behaviour and make amends.Talking to boys about masculinity will go better if we take a positive and empathetic approach, focused on supporting boys to build healthy, equitable relationships and friendships. Avoid unhelpful language that prompts defensiveness, like referring to men as “toxic”. Understand that boys may have had lengthy exposure to harmful messages about masculinity. And be patient and supportive in exploring these issues.Professor Michael Flood is a researcher on men, masculinities and gender at the Queensland University of Technology.Explore more on these topicsAdolescenceOpinionGenderParents and parentingFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

It’s not a pretty sightWed 26 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 26 Mar 2025 16.26 EDTSharePerhaps one of the greatest lessons of theDonald Trumpera, for me, has been in learning the difference between being shocked and being surprised. And indeed it was a bit shocking to learn, via an essay published by the Atlantic’s editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, that a high-profile journalist had been included on a chat on the commercial messaging app in which a military strike on the Houthi rebels in Yemen was coordinated – including discussions of the timing of the attack, debates about political messaging, personnel coordination and weapons to be used – seemingly without anyone noticing that he was there.It was shocking that their incompetence was so fortuitous – that the person they included, seemingly accidentally, in their unsecured group chat about war plans was someone so uniquely equipped to broadcast their idiocy to a large audience. But it was in no way surprising that members of theTrump administrationare behaving with such recklessness, shortsightedness, indifference to responsibility or peevish sadism. Of course they’re planning overseas bombings in a group chat, I thought when I first read Goldberg’s account. Because we live in an age where the people with the superlative power are those who are least temperamentally suited for it; because the stupidity of this White House outpaces any attempt at parody; and because these guys are exactly as dumb in real life as they look on television.The story goes like this: as part of its backing of Israel’s wars in the Middle East, theTrump administrationsought to strike against Houthi rebels, a coalition of Yemeni militants and pirates who have been attacking commercial vessels in the Red Sea in an attempt to pressure the west to stop supporting Israel’s war on Palestinians. Trump authorized a military strike on a scale more lethal and less precise than those that had previously been launched by the Biden administration; according to a Signal user identified as JD Vance, the president wanted to “send a message” and convey strength on the world stage. In the chat, no other strategic rationale for the strike was offered.Newly shared Signal messages show Trump advisers discussed Yemen attack plansRead moreSuch operations are supposed to be planned in secret, so that neither the targets, nor foreign governments, nor members of the media are aware of them ahead of time; the secrecy is what keeps the military personnel who carry out these strikes safe from some threats to their lives, and what allows the US to carry out its objectives unprompted. But the planning is also supposed to be documented, as much federal action is, to comply with records-keeping requirements.The resulting measures can be intense: often, to discuss classified matters, high-ranking federal officials enter safe rooms equipped with anti-surveillance technology, in which they are not allowed to take their phones; at other times, they are only permitted to discuss such matters on specially secured government-issued devices. (Signal, according to Goldberg, is not downloadable on these government devices, meaning that the administration officials in the chat were using their personal phones.) These are measures that have been put in place in order to protect interests that are worth protecting: to guard against foreign intelligence agencies (or, for that matter, magazine editors) learning of America’s plans, to keep Americans safe, to comply with records-keeping laws. Abiding by them is a sign of respect – both for the power of the executive, and for the law.And so that’s not what the Trump administration did. Instead, in order to coordinate the military strike, which was apparently greenlit by Trump in an in-person meeting in the White House situation room, the national security adviser, Michael Waltz, created an enormous national security threat by convening a planning group on a commercial messaging app.The group chat speaks to the essence of the second Trump administration: its cavalier incompetence, its contempt for human lifeWhy did the Trump officials use Signal for this, of all things? The reality is that they’re probably using it for a lot; the Heritage Foundation’sProject 2025, which has become something of a handbook for the Trump regime, recommends using private apps to conduct official business, so as to evade records-keeping laws. Signal is an app that is marketed for its privacy and message-disappearing features: a single member of a chat can mark messages to be deleted, permanently, for all members. (In another seemingly illegal move, Waltz reportedly set the messages in the war-planning group chat to disappear after a matter of weeks.)If the Trump administration’s members are habitually using Signal to conduct official business, the danger is not only that any foreign intelligence agency worth their salt (or any journalist who happens to benefit from their incompetence) could be listening in with relative ease. It’s that the records-keeping apparatus that is meant to preserve such conversations could not reach and document them – meaning that the use of Signal would specifically make such sensitive national security informationmoreaccessible to foreign adversaries andlessaccessible to historians and journalists here in the US.The content of the chats themselves is grim, too, providing an insight into the petty and eager social dynamics within Trump’s inner circle and the administration’s principle-thin commitment to any understanding of policy. Vance pipes up to suggest delaying the strike; he claims to be worried about public opinion on the issue, and complains that an attack on theHouthiswould provide economic benefits to Europe, who he wants to punish for some reason. He does not seem to feel he has enough clout to actually oppose the strike, however, undermining his own complaints with caveats that he will defer to others.The defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, chimes in, clearly thinking he’s supposed to be the center of attention, to eagerly but insubstantially support Vance’s points before pivoting to saying he wants to go ahead with the strike anyway. He has the cringing eagerness of a personality hire: he wants to be seen talking, but doesn’t really have much to say.Stephen Miller, Trump’s surrogate in the chat, says, bizarrely, that Europe will be made to compensate America for the strike at some later date, reflecting the Trumpian vision of all politics as an extortion racket to extract money, favors, or – perhaps more to the point – shows of deference. Everyone defers to Miller immediately. It is a group of very stupid people, trying to create post-hoc justifications for something their boss told them to do, not thinking too hard about what they’re actually doing – which is killing people.There is a risk, in talking about the Trump administration’s decision to plan a military strike over a Signal group chat in which they accidentally included a prominent journalist, of making it seem like the only problem with the administration’s actions was in their breach of confidentiality and decorum.But the controversy that erupted about the Signal chat after Goldberg revealed his inclusion on Monday seemed almost to overshadow the strategic folly and moral depravity of the strike itself: a reckless escalation in a volatile region that risked provokingIran, the Houthi’s backer and a nuclear state, and which took the lives of 53 human beings, including five children. That the strike seems to have been planned in a way that endangered national security and violated several federal laws should not blind us to the fact that the strike itself was stupid.But there is something in the story of the accidentally leaked war secrets group chat that speaks to the essence of the second Trump administration: its cavalier incompetence, its contempt for human life, its fealty to grievance and resentment, indifference to consequence, and jeering, jocular enthusiasm for violence. It shows us something about the Trump administration that we have previously seen only rarely: what they act like when they think they are in private.

I can give you comprehensive guidance on where to park, eat and drink near West Brom’s ground – Stoney Lane and the Soho Tavern, if you’re interested. I’m also good onchoosing urinals for domestic use– get one with a lid. But other than that, in the expertise department I’m a bit short. So I try to stay in my lane, because there will always be plenty of people who know much more than me about the matter at hand.Recipes are a good example. The Guardian alone has dozens of great cookery writers, so how dare I muster the temerity to throw a little something of my own in the pot? The temptation is great, as I forever yearn to be asked how I’ve made something. If I cook something that seems to be going down well, I ache for my victim to ask if I would mind sharing the recipe. Should they not ask, if they’re making all the right satisfied noises as they masticate, I have been known to shyly mutter something about emailing them the instructions. Tragic, really. I’m rarely asked to make good on this offer.If I cook something that goes down well, I ache for my victim to ask for the recipeAnd yet here I am, unbidden, daring to share with you a recipe. I’m sorry, needs must. Because every now and then something comes along that is so absurdly simple I can’t believe I didn’t know about it. I assumed I must be the only person in the world who isn’t in on the secret. But I’ve yet to come across anyone I’ve shared it with who has had a clue about it either. To be fair, a number of them have tried it once and only once, for the very good reason that they didn’t like it very much, but even they have had to acknowledge that it’s a dashed clever idea.What it is, is a bread (kind of) that you can make in 90 seconds. Well, that’s the cooking time. The prep takes 30 seconds, a minute tops. Which is quite something. Especially when I compare it with the time I spend making sourdough – going from that ecstasy of faff, stretching out over many hours and days, to knocking something up in less than the time it takes me to refresh my starter.I came across it when I last committed to losing some weight. The only way I can reliably, and relatively painlessly, shift some timber is by giving up bread. The more I eat it, the more I eat. That’s just the way it is. I’ll still bake it with the same enthusiasm, for others; I just don’t eat it. And that’s the other thing with this 90-second bread – because it’s made from almond flour there’s next to no carbs in it. When I first saw it somewhere on the internet, I thought it must be a spoof. But no.All you do is put three tablespoons of almond flour in a mug, along with a bit of salt and half a teaspoon of baking powder. And mix in an egg and a tablespoon of olive oil or melted butter. Then you microwave it on full power for 90 seconds. And out of the mug pops an alarmingly yellow, strangely shaped cylinder of something approximating bread. It’s roughly the shape of one of those mini cans of tonic water. Weird. Tastes a trifle weird too, to be honest. But slightly weird bread is better than bugger-all bread. And look, the quickest I can possibly come up with a sourdough loaf – not including days on end dicking around with the starter – is 12 hours. That’s 720 minutes – 288 times longer than this takes. And nice though my sourdough is, it’s not 288 times nicer than my strange little yellow log. So give it a try – it’s got to be worth a couple of minutes of your time.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBreadOpinionBakingFoodSourdoughDiets and dietingcommentShareReuse this content"

Don’t punish savers forchoosing safety! Don’t force everyone into stocks and shares! Think ofthe havoc you’ll cause for first-time buyersif you deprive banks and building societies of their stickiest source of deposits! Don’t fall for the self-interested lobbying of City fund managers!The cries were loud and furious before the spring statement and, in the event, Rachel Reeves did nothing on Isas. But prepare to have this quarrel all over again in the autumn becausethe documentsconfirmed the Treasury is still considering a cap on cash within an individual’s £20,000-a-year allowance.“The government is looking at options for reforms to individual savings accounts that get the balance right between cash and equities to earn better returns for savers, boost the culture of retail investment, and support the growth mission,” said the statement.The howls of protest will continue, then. But actually, Reeves is right to look at changes. The £20,000 allowance is generous by European standards. It is not unreasonable for the Treasury to ask if tax reliefs would do better work for everyone – savers included – if greater sums were directed at productive assets, such as UK equities.Such a reform would be in line with the original spirit ofIsasand their 1980s predecessors, Peps (personal equity plans) and Tessas (tax-exempt special savings accounts). On their introduction in 1999, the Isa allowance was £7,000, of which only £3,000 could go into cash. It was only as late as 2014, under George Osborne, that allowances were merged (and boosted to £15,000) and savers were given complete freedom to allocate as they wish.The old thinking was that savers enjoy a better return over any long-term period by being exposed to shares, a finding supported by virtually every statistical study. And it was also that tax reliefs should play a role in feeding capital into the UK funding pot for companies. Given the state of panic over the sleepy state of the London stock market, especially outside the big companies in the FTSE 100 index, that is not a small consideration.What would be a good “balance” for Isa rule-setting purposes? The pre-statement whisper said Reeves was considering acash limit of only £4,000 or £5,000, which would be radical. Politically speaking, it may be too radical. But a 50:50 split – in other words, keep the £20,000 overall allowance but only £10,000 could go into cash – might do the trick.That version of reform is backed by the New Financial thinktank and has the virtue of simplicity within an over-complicated Isa landscape. A cash cap at £10,000 would also leave most savers unaffected because three-quarters of allocations to cash Isas are below that level; most of the safety-first brigade could stick to existing habits.Instead, it would be those wealthy savers who max out their £20,000 allowance every year, and slot all or most of it into cash, who would be affected. The flow of money to the stock market might still be substantial – up to £10bn a year, thinks New Financial.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

First, the share-only portion ought to be UK-only. If the goal is to improve funding costs for UK companies, every pound that goes into global tracker funds, or is used for a flutter on Nvidia, misses the target. The Tory chancellor Jeremy Hunt’sunrealised vision of a “British Isa”– a UK-only £5,000 top-up above the £20,000 – would have beenfiddly and ineffective. Better to go the whole hog and make a pure case that UK tax reliefs should benefit UK-listed companies and UK-listed funds.Second,a pet grumble of this column: stamp duty on shares. The 0.5% levy on purchases of shares in UK companies brings in £3bn-plus to the Treasury, so immediate abolition is probably out of the question, even though no other major market imposes an equivalent charge at that level. But a commitment to phase out the levy over five years would be a useful signal. Reeves would be able to say she’s prodding savers towards shares while making the process cheaper. It still wouldn’t satisfy the cash-only diehards, but a chancellor’s horizons should be wider.Explore more on these topicsBusinessNils Pratley on financeIsasSaving moneySavingsSpring statement 2025Banks and building societiescommentShareReuse this content"

Namely, himself. The United States’ war plans are being divulged to journalists like gossip on a second-rate Real Housewives spinoff, but the focus of the American president is squarely on a painting of himself that he doesn’t care for. Trump posted on Truth Social, his personal squawk box for various grievances, that he takes umbrage with a depiction of his face in the Colorado state capitol.The painting depicts Trump as full-faced, cherubic and without wrinkles. He almost looks younger, like a large baby in a suit. Aboss baby, if you will. You might assume that at 78, Trump would jump at the chance to shave a few years off his face, but sadly, it seems he’d prefer to look like he waslit by the director of photography from Nosferatu.If I had to put my art critic hat on, I’d say Trump almost looks regal in the Colorado painting. Squint, and he resemblesHenry VIIIafter a shave. You’d think he’d be flattered by that association. After all, Henry VIII had twice the number of wives Trump has. So far.Trump outburst prompts removal of his ‘distorted’ portrait from Colorado capitolRead moreBut no, the ire of Trump came down fully on Sunday – and the painting wasswiftly removed. “Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves, but the one in Colorado, in the State Capitol, put up by the Governor, along with all other Presidents, was purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before,” Trump said in his social media post.The state of Colorado is an easy target for Trump. He lost it by 11 points in 2024. The governor, Jared Polis, is a Democrat. The painting was actuallycrowdfunded in large part by Republicans, but even then, for Trump, it was a perceived insult. And Trump is the kind of person to perceive insults around every corner.“The artist also did President Obama, and he looks wonderful, but the one on me is truly the worst,” he continued. I’m sure that compliment for Obama was one he typed withstubby-fingeredfrustration. No one should be getting the royal treatment but him. In a sense, that’s the most relatable thing about the man.The painting exposes him, casts him as soft, childlike and ill-prepared to wear the clothes of an adultTake a photo of me without my consent and chances are I will be horrified by the finished product – angles that make me look heavier, show off my ever-expanding bald spot or generally remind me of what I actually look like.

Photos reveal what people – strangers and familiars alike – actually see when they look at us: the facial tics, the gestures, the lumps and bumps and frown lines.Worse yet is a painting or drawing. That anyone submits to one of those exaggerated drawings from carnivals or the beach is beyond me. Why would you want a caricature of you drawn by someone you’ve never met, giving you a giant head and a pair of rollerblades or alarge pencil? Maybe someone should get one of these for Trump and see if he prefers it to the Henry VIII boss baby painting. “Sir, we thought you’d like this drawing of you surfing while wearing a backwards baseball hat and carrying a puppy in one hand.”There’s a caricature drawing of me on the wall of a bar in Los Angeles called Capri Club, if you ever find your way out here. My drawing sits among those of other regular patrons and luminaries of the neighborhood. It’s based off of a photo of me in front of said bar, having a martini. The moment captured is a lovely memory for me of a summer night well spent with friends and cocktails. The drawing, on the other hand, gives me deep anxiety. I look puffy, for starters. My substantial, jowly cheeks seem to grow every time I look at it, as though I have Dorian Gray-ed myself inside this bar. It’s very clearly me up there, but it’s not who I see myself to be. Granted, if I drew myself, I’d just be a wobbly stick with a circle for a head. So perhaps I shouldn’t be giving notes to artists.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I am pained when I think about how other people look at me. I know I’m not alone in that self-conscious whinging and navel-gazing. I wish I could blithely ignore the cacophony of doubt, but I can’t manage it, and countless people in the world feel the same way.Perhaps that’s why I’m mildly shocked Trump is so concerned with how he looks in a painting inColorado. This is a man who tells the world he never doubts himself, that he is resolute in his decision-making and is always in control. The first few months of his second term in office have been almost exclusively about proving how strong he is and that anyone who wrongs him will be punished.So why be so worried about a painting? Perhaps it’s that the painting exposes him, casts him as soft, childlike and ill-prepared to wear the clothes of an adult. His preferred image of himself is a backlit Batman villain rather than the backwards-aging Benjamin Button in Colorado. In that case, maybe the painting did its job.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionArtUS politicsColoradocommentShareReuse this content"

It may be profitable for shareholders but it’s destructive for everyone elseWed 26 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 26 Mar 2025 13.43 EDTShareWelcome to Mipim, the world’s largest real estate fair, which returned to Cannes this month. Picture an ocean of property developers in blue suits and puffy gilets thronging theFrench beachfront. Inside the convention centre, instead of salespeople fronting the booths, you’ll find politicians talking up their region’s heritage, sport teams, music scenes, universities and waterfronts, with glossy prospectuses to tempt global investors.About one-quarterof Mipim attendees are from the UK, with every British banner and brochure focused on one thing: courting investors with the promise of growth. A billboard declares Manchester “The UK’s Growth Opportunity”. Another proclaims that in the Tees Valley, “Anything is Possible”. Newcastle’s CEO and director of investment and growth tell me how the city makes development “dead easy for investment”. But the question is: growth for whom?At a panel discussion, six senior officials from across the north of England vie to seduce an audience of investors – like Dragons’ Den for property tycoons – to choose their city to build major new property developments. After decades of Tory austerity, and with no sign of Labour restoring council funding to its full pre-2010 levels, this is what Britain’s municipalities are reduced to: grubbing for cash to build projects they cannot afford to fund themselves. It’s an unedifying spectacle to see local governments pleadingat the feet of international capital.After hearing yet another UK council leader lionise the growth opportunities for investors in their city, a consultant next to me mutters: “How do they expect to increase returns for investors without increasing inequality?” It’s a damning question – one which cuts to the heart not just of Mipim, but the whole sector of investment-led real estate development.Private sector property investors are not altruists. Backers may be persuaded to support major developments, with councils promising to smooth the process of securing planning permission, but there’s no such thing as a free lunch. When investors put their money into real estate, whether they’re building housing, retail or commercial skyscrapers, they are always hoping to pump up the local land value, pushing up rents to make chunkier profits.But when property prices grow faster than local wages, inequality shoots up too, strainingpoorer communitiesand displacing businesses.Poorer families spendmore of their income on housingthan rich ones, and the higher that development raises prices, the more extreme the disparity becomes.We see this when longstanding affordable cafes shut in the shadow of a shiny new tower because they canno longer afford the inflated lease, or our kids can’t afford to live where they grew up despite there beingmore new homes in the area than ever.And while big developments can generate local construction jobs, not all that investment goes into the local economy. Britain runs a trade deficit of more than£14bnon building materials, for example, meaning a significant proportion of the price of a new tower block is often immediately going out of the country on importing foreign steel and timber. When the original investors are based overseas, as is the case with our big build-to-rent developers – the majority of which areowned by foreign private equity firms– their profits also leave the UK.In 2016, London was in the grips of a post-Olympics, pre-Brexit boom, and City Hall officials could see that the unfettered growth of the preceding years had come at a cost.Finn Williams, then an officer at the Greater London Authority, told me: “Social infrastructure was becoming more and more stretched. Estate regeneration was displacing existing communities and causing environmental damage. The production and performance spaces that our cultural scene depended on were being lost to redevelopment.”A two-tier housing market will be the result of Labour’s half-baked leasehold reform plans | Harry ScoffinRead moreWilliams and his team saw that growth was not inherently good for London, as many had previously assumed. They realised that a line needed to be drawn between developments that could achieve genuine social goals and those which were simply extracting value for shareholders by jacking up asset prices. So in 2017, shortly after he was elected mayor, Sadiq Khan unveiled his Good Growth by Design drive – an explicit acknowledgment that not all types of growth were desirable.The big problem with Mipim is not the boozy beachfront networking – it is the underlying assumption that local authorities and planning departments should do whatever it takes to enable growth for investors over the good of their communities. It is a myopic mindset that risks flooding Britain with bad developments that are profitable for their shareholders but destructive for everyone else.UK local authorities go to Cannes seeking private investment because under this government they have little choice, but we may soon find that the cities we are so desperate to flog are no longer worth living in. Their future will have been sold off, one glossy prospectus at a time.Phineas Harper is a writer and curatorExplore more on these topicsHousingOpinionCommunitiesLocal governmentReal estatePropertycommentShareReuse this content"

The public are tuning outWed 26 Mar 2025 14.59 EDTLast modified on Wed 26 Mar 2025 15.01 EDTShareRachel Reeves’s springstatementmattered as much for what she didn’t say as what she did. The chancellor mentioned neither the poor nor inequality. There was no defence of the welfare state, no transformative ambition, no urgency – even amid a climate crisis. Labour promised a break with the past, but she delivered continuity in technocratic clothing. She cast Labour as a competent manager, not a party of ideas – comfortable with markets constraining policy. Ms Reeves framed spending cuts as pragmatic, not ideological. In her vision, “responsibility” means restraint, not redistribution. Labour was once called amoral crusade. For her, it is neither.She will dismay many in her party. Their disappointment will deepen if they read the documents accompanying her statement. TheOffice for Budget Responsibility(OBR) warns unemployment is set to rise.Unprotectedspending will be cut in real terms. It spells out that welfare cuts are driving a deficit reduction, and taxes are at record highs without matching social investment.More than 20 peoplewill be poorer for everyone personher reforms push into work. It’s hard not to conclude that Ms Reeves has repackaged austerity as “stability”, sacrificing the most vulnerable on the altar of prudence.The fiscal rules themselves are a source of volatility, turning every OBR forecast into budget theatre. Economists peer through a glass, darkly – reliant on models that blur more than they clarify. The result is predictable drama. Staying within the rules hinges on optimistic assumptions about growth, interest rates and productivity. Even the OBR gives Ms Reeves just a 54%chanceof hitting her target. That’s a coin toss.Poor productivity, a modest rise in interest rates or a Trumpian trade shock could all derail her plans. These aren’t black swan events – they’re credible risks in a volatile world. Her rules leave no margin for any of them. Yet from 2026-27, they’ll permit an extra0.5% of GDP– about £13bn – in day-to-day spending. Still, Ms Reeves will push250,000more people into poverty – nearly all from disabled households – to meet a rule that won’t even exist by the time it’s meant to be met.One of Ms Reeves’s most misleading tactics is conflatingcapital investmentwith cuts to day-to-day spending – the kind that keeps services running, not building new ones – and so dressing up austerity as ambition. While making cuts, she touts £2.2bn more for defence and £2bn for affordable housing. The former won’t lift demand; the latter barely dents the damage from welfare cuts. She’s cutting the country’s social wage and calling it responsibility, while boosting the military and calling it investment. It’s sleight of hand that George Osborne would be proud of – from a Labour chancellor.Labour campaigned as agents of change. In office, it has governed as bean-counters. The public has noticed – and is tuning out. Ipsos Moripollingshows 62% of voters say Britain is heading in the wrong direction; just 15% think it isn’t. Ms Reeves’s fiscal caution hasn’t built confidence, and won’t. Voters want visible, material improvements, especially on living costs and public services – where Labour has yet to deliver. It risks losing its voting coalition by chasing supposed credibility over change, managing a crisis it inherited, but refusing to challenge with the tools it controls. Ms Reeves may point to last year’s election win to blunt criticism. Yet if success is the only virtue and morality optional, then failure is not just defeat – it is disgrace.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They are outraged because they believe that the arrest of Istanbul’s mayor is a tipping point, with the country sliding from authoritarian democracy to outright autocracy.Authorities have now arrested more than 1,400 protesters, including numerousphotojournalists. They areclamping down on coverageof a movement that Mr Erdoğan describes as “evil”, but which is driven by anger at cumulative political repression and the parlous state of the economy.The next presidential election is not due until 2028. But the arrest of Mr İmamoğlu for alleged corruption and terror links last week – he was subsequently charged on the former count – could hardly have more suspicious timing. It camedays beforehis CHP party was to nominate him for the presidency. The night before his detention, Istanbul University annulled his diploma; a degree is required to run for the presidency. Both moves have been widely decried as politically motivated.About 13 million people reacted by joining the 1.7 million CHP members in backing him as nominee, according to the party. Mr Erdoğan, too, was an Istanbul mayor who was jailed – only to triumph politically. That, however, was in a more volatile political landscape. In contrast, Mr Erdoğan has entrenched power over two decades. He weathered the massGezi Park protestsin 2013 and used anattempted coupthree years later to launch a wide-ranging purge that cemented his power and crushed broader dissent.Term limits preclude him running again in 2028. But the fear is that he plans to do so by either changing the constitution or calling early elections. The jailed PKK founderAbdullah Öcalan’s recent callfor fighters to lay down arms has raised questions over whether the government is attempting to draw support from a pro-Kurdish political party.The ballot box has been one of the last places where Turkish citizens could truly have their say, even if opposition politicians – including Mr İmamoğlu – have often been hobbled both before and after elections. People were furious at punitive inflation – and the government has now spentup to $25bnstabilising the lira due to this self-inflicted crisis. Mr İmamoğlu’s affable image has also proved attractive to conservative voters who previously shied from his party. But Mr Erdoğan presumably hopes that anger will ebb and the economic situation improve before the next election.The other dimension of the timing is international. Mr Trump, who likes strongmen, has just described Mr Erdoğan as a good leader. Europe is preoccupied by Ukraine and US security abandonment – with the latter meaning it seeks greater security cooperation with Ankara. Leaders previously swift to criticise Mr Erdoğan have been strikingly muted. Yet European governments have leverage if they choose to use it. They should.At home, the CHP says that it is shifting from daily street protests to other means, such aseconomic boycotts. But these protests have seen a striking coalition of formal political opposition and frustrated young people with their own views and tactics. That relationship could disintegrate under those tensions. But their differences have so far proved fertile and could yet lead to a more spontaneous, less predictable and possibly more successful movement than Mr Erdoğan anticipates.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Theproposed billdefines the syndrome as characterised by “verbal expressions of intense hostility toward” Donald Trump and “overt acts of aggression and violence against anyone supporting [Trump] or anything that symbolises [Trump].”Such a bill obviously infringes on our constitutional right to freely criticise our elected leaders and can serve as a stepping stone towards labelling and punishing political opponents under the guise of utilising a variety of compulsory psychiatric interventions. However, this bill is reminiscent of anti-Trumpmental health professionalswho have opined that President Trump poses a great danger because of a severe personality disorder.Clearly, a psychiatric diagnosis can only be made by mental health professionals who are licensed to do so, and only after having examined a patient. It poses great danger to our society both when legislators use their political power to impose a psychiatric label on their political opponents and when mental health professionals misapply their expertise to give a psychiatric label to those whom they fear.In the 1960s, many psychiatrists opined on the mental health of the Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. As a result of that controversy, in 1973 the American Psychiatric Association developed the “Goldwater rule”, which applies to public figures. It states that it is unethical for a psychiatrist to offer a proper authorisation for such a statement.This rule is still in effect, though much too often broken. Perhaps we need to develop a comparable national rule prohibiting political personnel, both elected and appointed, from creating psychiatric diagnoses as a tool against their political opponents.Leon HoffmanPsychiatrist, New York City, USHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Arsenal had been here before, overturning a 1-0 defeat by Bayern Munich to reach the semi-finals last season, but the mountain was that bit bigger, Athenea del Castillo adding to Linda Caicedo’s strike in the 82nd minute of the first leg to heap pressure on the showdown in north London.There could be no excuses on the carpet-like surface for which their game is built, the torrential rain and torn-up pitch at the Estadio Alfredo Di Stefáno providing some forgiving context to the 2-0 defeat in Spain.This was at Arsenal’s home, though, in front of more than 20,000 fans who anxiously urged their team forward again and again as they sought to reduce the deficit early on. The home team were dominant, accruing more than 65% of possession in the first half and 26 touches in the opposition box to Madrid’s three.For all that, though, the final ball was poor, one shot on target before the interval a damning statistic. Maëlle Lakrar did well to deny Alessia Russo after a wonderful flick from Katie McCabe was met by the England forward and an unmarked Mariona Caldentey sent a header off the bar from the resulting corner. Caitlin Foord struggled to connect cleanly with a Russo ball and landed heavily, and cross after cross from Kelly was wasted.In the 41st minute there was a huge let‑off for the Gunners, Daphne van Domselaar’s double save keeping them in it. That was the final meaningful action of the first half and, with time ticking away from the hosts, hope started to seep from the crowd.Madrid were well organised, having made just one enforced change to the team that won in Spain, with Melanie Leupolz absent through injury, and confidence was high following a first defeat of the La Liga champions Barcelona on Sunday. They absorbed the Arsenal pressure relatively comfortably.View image in fullscreenMariona Caldentey celebrates scoring Arsenal’s second goal.Photograph: Ashley Western/Colorsport/ShutterstockThere was no time to waste but the blueprint had been there in the first half. It took one minute for Arsenal to do what they had not been able to do for 45 minutes: capitalise on Kelly’s crosses.Russo turned in from her England teammate straight after the restart and three minutes later the tie was level via the same source – this time Caldentey’s head was there to meet Kelly’s ball and direct it coolly past Misa Rodríguez.Just before the hour Arsenal had the lead in the tie for the first time when McCabe’s free-kick was nodded down by Steph Catley and swept in by Russo.

The semi-final against Montemurro’s Lyon awaits, with the French giants having secured a 6-1 aggregate win against Bayern Munich. Those fixtures will be played over the last two weekends in April.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueArsenal WomenReal Madrid WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They spent most of Tuesday chewing the fat, then sunk their teeth into a steak dinner at Hawksmoor restaurant. Bread was broken, the next significant signpost towards the summer tour of Australia ticked off.If there were no major surprises on his coaching staff – three from Ireland and one each from Scotland and England – it felt telling that while you could make a pretty good guess, no one has yet been assigned specific roles. Farrell wants his staff to work in harness rather than worry about precise remits in isolation, to build cohesion rather than concern themselves with detail just yet.Wigglesworth and Easterby named as assistant Lions coachesRead moreEqually telling was the fact that on day one, the coaches put together a long list of about 75 players in contention for selection when Farrell makes the final call on 8 May. No one was off limits – players based in France, significantly those from England who are seen as unavailable for their national team, will be considered and oh to be a fly on the wall whenOwen Farrellcame up for discussion.Like it or not, until the final squad is announced, the subject of Owen Farrell’s potential inclusion is the most dominant narrative surrounding this summer’s tour. The coach’s son, a former England captain made a pariah after the last World Cup, his country’s record points scorer, a born winner, a three-time Lion, an experienced fly‑half in a field full of greenhorns, perhaps the most polarising figure in the English game.Farrell Jr has endured a difficult first season at Racing 92 in the French Top 14. Stuart Lancaster has been sacked by Racing, such have been their travails, and Farrell has not been helped by a groin injury from which he has just recovered. Those close to him, those who have played with him before, worry that such has been his gruelling workload, nearly 17 years after breaking through at Saracens, that his body is creaking.The Racing owner, Jacky Lorenzetti, who is never shy of voicing his opinion, described him earlier this season as playing “at the speed of a snail going backwards”, though he did add: “On the field, we haven’t seen the real Farrell. However, day to day we can count on an incredible leader, who loves the club and wants to win.”And listen to Andy Farrell describe what he is looking for in his captain for this summer’s Lions tour of Australia and it was hard not to alight on the elephant in the room.“He’s got to be highly respected within the group, and a person that’s more than comfortable being himself within that, and is able to do that,” he said.“Obviously he’s got to have the respect, not just as a player, not just as a leader within the changing room, but a leader in the way that he handles himself in the entirety of what a Lions captain should be.”View image in fullscreenThe British & Irish Lions head coach, Andy Farrell, has talked of a need for respected players in the squad.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersAs much as Maro Itoje and Caelan Doris can be considered frontrunners, there is little doubting that Farrell Jr ticks the above boxes. Listen to players from Scotland, Ireland and Wales, those who did not know him well before touring with him, talk about Farrell’s influence on previous Lions tours and they are unequivocally glowing.Warren Gatland, head coach for the three tours on which Owen Farrell has appeared, has been equally effusive and though it was the player’s decision to step away from England duty – a decision made before his move to France – he has admitted this season that it would be “massive” to make a fourth tour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

From England, the Smiths Fin and Marcus can be considered in contention, the Ireland duo of Sam Prendergast and Jack Crowley, too. Perhaps at the age of 32 there is finally a place on a Lions tour for George Ford but the argument for including someone of Farrell’s experience is obvious. Equally, with Sione Tuipulotu still recovering from a chest injury, there is no outstanding candidate at inside-centre.Scotland’s dangermen Russell and Van der Merwe loom large for EnglandRead moreSuddenly, the arguments for Farrell’s inclusion become obvious but when asked specifically about whether his son was in the frame, there was evidently a degree of awkwardness, a keenness to move swiftly on. “Same as everyone else. He’s just coming back from injury. You keep an eye on everything, and him like every other player as well, so yeah.”Farrell Sr is his own man. He gave an articulate, compelling answer when asked whether he might feel the need to pick any Welsh players purely on the basis of satisfying quotas – short answer, no – and will not worry about upsetting anyone if he feels Owen warrants his place in the squad.Equally, he is a father and when the backlash toOwen’s red card for a high tackleduring a 2023 World Cup warmup game reached fever pitch, Andy’s reaction was scathing: “The circus that has gone around all of this is absolutely disgusting, in my opinion.”It was one of the rare occasions that the curtain was pulled back on a relationship that has been so outwardly professional for so many years. Farrell Sr unashamedly paternal, protective, with junior cast in a light of vulnerability when so often he has come across as bulletproof. It is a relationship that fascinates and, as a result, so too does his potential selection this summer.Explore more on these topicsBritish & Irish LionsAndy FarrellOwen FarrellRugby unioncommentShareReuse this content"

Wise words there from TS Eliot, who, to be fair, never had to rebuild a high-end Premier League team while also dealing with closing out a title race, natural era-wastage, and losing your most successful homegrown player since the glory days of Phil Thompson waving the European Cup around in the pub and all that.ForLiverpoolsupporters it seems likely the next month will bring a wildly varying emotional register. Departures and farewells. Winning the league in front of actual non-quarantined humans. The sense, even through the veil of commemorative red smoke, that the team that got you here are finally starting to become something else. Spring is always a time of reckoning up in football, April the cruellest month, all new shoots and final blooms, memories and desires, cheers but also sometimes jeers. So yeah. Let’s see how that pans out for the lads.Real Madrid open up old Liverpool wounds with Alexander-Arnold move | John BrewinRead moreThis is the real point about the news thatTrent Alexander‑Arnold’s move to Real Madrid is all but done. It is, of course, simply confirmation by now. Leaving on a free transfer is entirely on the club not the player, just as it is a bit nuts to suggest Alexander‑Arnold should have signed an unwanted new contract in the hope this might winkle out more money for his soon to be former employer.But it is still a shock for fans to see this finally come to pass. It is also logical and reassuring that this will draw a powerful emotional response. Football is not supposed to be a forgiving place when it comes to this kind of stuff. There is simply no point having a reasoned counterpoint, or suggesting, well, people leave jobs all the time. Football is not hotel management.The emotional response, the tribal element; this is why football has survived more or less in the same form to this day. These are the roots that clutch. This is why it is pointless telling anyone how to feel about things such as this. This isn’t a reasoned discussion. It’s a passion play of ownership and familial bonds, dreams and madness. This quality is also a vital economic asset. The day everyone is just fine with this and says: “Good luck, what’s your new Insta, I’m a Madrid fan now”, is the day football dies as a spectacle worth following.View image in fullscreenTrent Alexander-Arnold was encouraged by Jürgen Klopp not to compromise on his gifts.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAGrief and rage then: these are a necessary corollary. But we will get past them. At which point there is a note of clarity. ForArne Slotthe departure of Alexander‑Arnold is also an opportunity, and a necessary piece of signposting. Sport always moves forward. What is actually happening here, and will now perhaps happen more clearly, is the end of a very distinct era. Who knows, it could be the making of the new one, too.First up, it is necessary to pay tribute to Alexander-Arnold, and in a way that speaks to this dynamic. The Premier League will miss him almost as much as Liverpool, because he is a non-standard footballer, extravagantly skilled and also brittle, encouraged by Jürgen Klopp not to compromise on his outstanding gifts and to become a super‑strength player, in a way that has created so many unforgettable moments.Alexander-Arnold has more assists and more shots than any other career defender in Premier League history. At the same time, while he isn’t exactly a bad defender, he can be a disastrous one. We remember the inadvertent comedy of the 2022 Champions League final‑winning goal, the he’s‑behind‑you pantomime dynamic of Vinícius Júnior sneaking a full 60 yards on Alexander‑Arnold’s blind side to score from a cross, as maddening as it was also comically sigma male, the A-list defender who just will not defend.View image in fullscreenTrent Alexander-Arnold: so casual you half expect to look down and notice he’s wearing flip-flops.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianOn the other side, we have the genuinely sublime and original passing, the full range of angles, vision, cut, fade, variations of pace; always effective but also just so much fun to watch in a homogenised game. Alexander-Arnold is one of the few remaining elite maverick talents, out there making the game interesting, moving about with that familiar mooching grace, so casual you half expect to look down and notice he’s wearing flip-flops.This is how good he is: Madrid don’t want him to replace Dani Carvajal, or not completely. They want him to replace Toni Kroos too, to restore some of his range of passing. MeanwhileAlexander‑Arnold wants to win a Ballon d’Or. Good luck with both of those. Time will be short. The noises off are unforgiving. And Madrid have to win.So much for the departed. This is above all a moment for the team that remains, and in essence the real end of the Klopp era. To date Slot has been able to show only his best side, repurposing inherited parts, adding new gears and altering the tempo, always sure-footed in public, striding his touchline looking like the owner of a successful chain of provincial bakers here to receive a regional business award from the Duchess of Sandwich.It is still best to see the new era as a hybrid to this point, an extended Viking funeral for the age of Klopp. This has been a high-grade first fix, but Liverpool have looked tired as the season has narrowed, and in a way that feels like more than just a physical thing. This is a side reaching their tipping point. And this summer could yet bring a genuine tectonic shift.View image in fullscreenVirgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah could also end up leaving Liverpool this summer.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesAlexander-Arnold may or may not be followed by Mohamed Salah and/or Virgil van Dijk. But those two will 33 and 34 years old by the start of next season. For all the hopeful talk about science and conditioning, nobody outruns the clock. The influence of both will necessarily diminish from this point. In the process Liverpool are close to losing not just their three best players but their three best players by a mile and the defining architecture of an era.It will be incredibly hard to navigate this. The game is never about individuals. Except sometimes when it actually is. For the past seven years Liverpool have basically lost two or three games a season when all three of these players start. Even when they have a bad day Liverpool can always lean on their right side, or the cold still centre in defence. And while Slot has been rightly praised for his excellent choices, it does help to have a fearless dead-eye super-ripped machine-genius finisher in the team who just keeps validating every single one of them by scoring the winning goal.From Sels to Salah: a Premier League best XI of the season so farRead moreAgain, uncertainty and departures also present an opportunity. Alexander-Arnold in particular is a handy star player to lose, if only because he is so unusual in his style and impact that there is no real idea of replacing him directly. This is a good thing. It leaves room for different strengths and patterns, a way of playing that Slot himself can wholeheartedly engineer. At the same time, every end-of-contract exit removes the need for Slot to manage that change himself, to placate or defenestrate basking stars. Not leaving can also be a problem. May we direct the jury at this point to exhibit A: the wasteland previously known as football overlords Manchester United. Every major departure also brings with it a note of freedom, all the more so for Slot, with a league title all but under his belt.For all the serene progress to this point, this team don’t really look finished. Is the midfield really settled? Is Salah-dependence, the sheer weight of his goals and assists, really a long-term recipe for success? Either way it seems clear this will not become another Souness-style nightmare, an act of precision rebalancing carried out with all the delicacy of a man repointing a gingerbread house with a sledgehammer.But the rebuild was always waiting. And while Alexander‑Arnold may not have left an envelope of cash on the mantelpiece to help that process he is at least speeding it along, giving information, flagging the task to come.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolTrent Alexander-ArnoldArne SlotcommentShareReuse this content"

When she told him, she said there was a lot of screaming and he said she was “incompetent” and “stupid”.“I clearly said: ‘Shut up’, because it didn’t stop,” Ingrid told the court in Sandes inNorway. “When I said that, I got a hand in the face. He hit me in the face. It was fast and it was hard. It hurt.”The court was told it was one of seven alleged incidents of physical and verbal abuse to which she was subjected by Gjert, who shot to global prominence after coaching three of his sons to Olympic, world and European glory. Their success was captured in the TV documentary series Team Ingebrigtsen, each episode of which was watched by more than 1 million Norwegians.However, the third day of the trial of Gjert Ingebrigtsen heard of more harrowing allegations that were never captured by the cameras. Gjert, who faces six years in prison if ­convicted of abusive behaviour towards Jakob and Ingrid, denies all allegations of violence.On another occasion Ingrid said that her father had screamed so forcibly at her in the car that she had broken down in tears. She said she thought the incident had occurred after she couldn’t change the radio or check the weather forecast.“He asked me if I was afraid of him,” she told the court. “I think that was very difficult to answer. I remember thinking: ‘What ­happens if I answer yes? What happens if I answer no?’ So I didn’t answer right away. Then I remember he asked again and again until I answered. Then I ended up answering ‘yes’.”Her father could not understand her answer, the judges heard. “It was the stupidest thing he had ever heard,” Ingrid said. “And didn’t drive home until I promised I wouldn’t tell anyone, especially not my mum, because he was afraid of what she would think.”According to the indictment, Gjert is alleged to have abused his daughter “by using threats, coercion, violence, restricting her freedom of movement and violating her in other ways”. The court was told that these incidents included calling Ingrid an “idiot” when she was sick and pushing her with both hands in the upper body so that she fell to the floor after an argument.Earlier in the day, Jakob told the court under cross-examination that the TV series Team Ingebrigtsen was not an accurate portrayal of what went on in the family. “The problem we had with it is that it didn’t reflect reality,” the Tokyo 2020 Olympics 1500m and Paris 2024 5,000m champion said. “A lot changed when the camera crew was present. When they film, it is presented in a more ­humorous and cosy way.”On Tuesday Jakob told the court that he had beenkicked and punched by his fatherwhen he was as young as eight or nine, and that he con­tinued to face other threats as he got older. But when questioned he admitted that he had not seen his father do ­anything physical to his older ­brothers Henrik and Filip – and that when he moved out of the family home at 18 to be with his now‑wife, Elisabeth, he still lived just 300 metres from his father.“That was as far as I dared to go, because I felt I definitely needed my parents’ consent, even though I was of legal age,” Jakob said. “I was afraid that the defendant would ­sabotage my life. He had a lot of ­control over finances, training and things that meant a lot to me.”Jakob, who told the court he had split from his father and coach early in 2022 after he hit Ingrid in the face with a wet towel, said that Gjert had messaged him later that year when he could only win 1500m silver in the WorldAthleticsChampionships in Eugene. “The defendant was happy that I failed,” he said. “And he conveyed that with that message.”The trial, which is due to last until 16 May, continues.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsNorwaynewsShareReuse this content"

More support may soon come given the subcommittee that produced the report included Tom Harrison, the former chief executive of the England and WalesCricketBoard, who is favourite to replace the ­outgoing ICC chief, Geoff Allardice.Central to the WCA’s proposals is a reorganisation of international fixtures similar to Uefa’s successful introduction of the Nations League, with ad hoc bilateral series replaced by a competitive structure that would give “all international cricket meaning”.International teams would be split into divisions of up to eight in each of the three major formats, with all teams in each mini-league playing each other at least once in every two‑year cycle with promotion, rele­gation and World Cup qualification at stake.This would replace the ­existing World Test Championship, which may anyway soon be overhauled. Currently teams do not all play each other in every cycle, forcing a convoluted scoring system that Ben Stokes, England’s Test captain, criticised last year as “utterly confusing”. The ECB is also due to petition the ICC to stop deducting WTC points for slow over rates, without which England would have finished third in the most recent cycle rather than fifth.Most fixtures in the WCA’s proposed leagues would be played during four windows each year – they suggest that each should be about 21 days long, which notably would not be enough for a five-Test series. No major franchise cricket would be played during these breaks.The WCA, which represents ­players in most major cricketing nations – but not India – also argues for a more equitable distribution of the game’s wealth.India receives nearly 40% of the ICC’s net earnings, while 87% of revenue from bilateral international cricket is kept by the three major cricket markets of India, England and Australia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If national boards cannot agree to share revenue more equitably – which it admits is “a likely scenario” – it suggests creating an unspecified “new global cricket product” that would do so.“While current models may suit the bigger countries in the short term, they ultimately limit the sport’s growth potential,” it writes, advocating a fairer system that would “increase investment, talent depth and retention, and in turn competitive balance across more countries”.It also calls for the system for freeing players to appear in foreign franchise tournaments – which is entirely at the whim of their national association – to be scrapped and replaced with a “compulsory player-release mechanism”.Explore more on these topicsCricketInternational Cricket CouncilSport politicsShareReuse this content"

The vote will take place after a hybrid meeting, with some expected to attend online.Beaumont, who wasparachuted into the RFU on a temporary basisafter Tom Ilube resigned in December, and the rest of the board have backed Sweeney throughout. With such a large electorate and the turnout uncertain, the outcome of the RFU’s first SGM for 25 years is impossible to predict.Sweeney has made it clear he will not resign and he is unlikely to be sacked immediately even if he suffers a humiliating defeat. In that event, the RFU would call an emergency board meeting for Friday to decide on their next steps.The SGM will be opened by the RFU president, Rob Udwin, before the motion is introduced by Paddy McAlpine, chair of Chichester RFC and one of four co-chairs of WGU, a rebel alliance of clubs from the Championship down to grassroots leagues.View image in fullscreenBill Beaumont (left) took over as interim RFU chair after Tom Ilube quit after the row about Bill Sweeney’s pay.Composite: GettyA counter resolution from the RFU board has also been tabled seeking members’ approval of “the acceleration” of a review of governance and representation that was started last May by Malcolm Wharton, a former member of the RFU council and RFU board. The governance review will recommend devolving more decision-making to local and regional bodies to counter accusations of the SGM simply ratifying the status quo.“The first motion arose because a number of members clearly felt frustrated by the challenges they are seeing around the game and because they believed that forcing our CEO out would help change that,” Beaumont said. “While I do not doubt their concern, a vote of no confidence in our CEO will not change this for the better.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Voting against the first motion this Thursday will allow us to get on with this job and not spend months consumed by the rancour and disruption that this process has brought.”The WGU immediately responded by claiming that the RFU board are not suitable leaders for the sport. “The rancour and disruption to the game has only been caused by the intransigence of the executive and board and their unwillingness to listen to and hear the issues raised over several years by participants, member clubs and referees’ societies,” it said. “Despite offers to engage and work on a way forward, the board and senior executive have refused to do so, which illustrates their unsuitability to lead our game.“This vote for change is asking the board to remove our CEO through a managed process. Let’s not forget that our past chair did the right thing and resigned rather than waiting for a special general meeting or annual general meeting forcing him to go.“Regardless of the result, we have highlighted to the rugby world what is going on within the inner corridors of Twickenham and that is a big step forward with clubs engaging in how the future may look. No one wins today as the game has already lost so much after successive boards’ failure through lack of direction and poor leadership.”Explore more on these topicsRugby Football UnionRugby unionSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Two separate sources at tier-four clubs praised the extensiveness of the consultation.An email sent to lower-league clubs on Wednesday and seen by the Guardian, said: “The consultation period was an opportunity for us to listen to and understand the views of the wider game. Therefore, given what we have heard, it is recognised that more work is required to find the right solution to the challenges, and the current proposals will not be moving forward at this time.”The plans would have also led to the divisions in tiers three and four of the pyramid increasing from 12 to 14 teams per division. There would have been changes to the promotion rules too, with three rather than two teams relegated to tier four from each of the tier-three divisions. The four league winners in tier four would be promoted and the runners-up would have entered playoffs to determine two new promotion spots. Additionally, there would have been a vast expansion of tier six, which has 16 divisions and that could have risen to as many as 24 regional leagues with 10 teams per league, if the plans had gone ahead.Instead, the existing one-up, one‑down structure will remain in place across those leagues. But it is understood there remains a commitment from the FA to continue ­reviewing the options for how the leagues should look in the future.One of the key reasons the proposals were drawn up in the first place was that the governing body had sought to find ways to enhance the amount of meaningful, competitive matches that 16- to-19-year-old players were receiving, amid widespread concerns at lots of clubs about the state of the reserve and academy leagues. Discussions about different ways to resolve this issue will continue, but the earliest any future changes could come in would now have to be the summer of 2027.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are still no guarantees that green investment will not be quietly cut in the near future.But at a time whenthe UK’s green sectors are growing at three times the rate of the rest of the economy, according to the CBI, ignoring climate and environment policy means missing vital opportunities.Ed Matthew, UK programme director at the E3G thinktank, said: “The chancellor has left a huge open goal by neglecting the clean economy as the primary driver for growth in the UK. While the broader economy slumped, the clean economy boomed, growing by 10% last year, creating £83bn of added value.“If the government is serious about growth, it must stop tinkering at the edges and ramp up capital investment into the clean economy – the best chance we have for economic recovery.”A host of measures – including some thatLabour espoused in opposition, but which are now on the back-burner or under threat – could deliver cost savings for households and businesses, economic opportunities, and revenue for the Treasury.Insulating homeslowers bills, cuts waste,improves healthand creates jobs. The government pledged £13.2bn by 2030 for a“warm homes plan”in its manifesto, but Westminster insiders suggestthis spending could be under threatdue to the chancellor’s “non-negotiable”fiscal rules.Owing to the way the UK’s electricity market has worked since privatisation, electricity bills are set by the marginal wholesale price of gas, which is often the most expensive energy option on the grid.Tackling climate crisis will increase economic growth, OECD research findsRead moreThis could be changed, and shifting green levies from bills to general taxation,reforming the marketand updating infrastructure would also make electricity cheaper, encourage the switch to electric vehicles and low-carbon power and allow for greater efficiency.Chris Glover, director of total utilities management at the engineering firm Buro Happold, said: “We currently pay around £1bn per annum to curtail renewable energy generation when the grid cannot handle the power.“This eye-watering amount of money is simply passed on to consumers, who end up paying for both the curtailed renewable energy and the gas that replaces it.”Fossil fuel dependence has been a key factor in high inflation, according to the Treasury. But the £8.3bn promised for Great British Energy to spur the development of more renewable generation, though unmentioned by Reeves,is in question.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The study – which accounted for nearly 100,000 sites across all continents – found that human activities had resulted in “unprecedented effects on biodiversity”,according to the paper, published in Nature.Florian Altermatt, professor of aquatic ecology at the University of Zurich and head of Eawag, said: “It is one of the largest syntheses of the human impacts on biodiversity ever conducted worldwide.”The team looked at terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats, as well as including all groups of organisms, including microbes, fungi, plants, invertebrates, fish, birds and mammals.Human pressures distinctly shifted community composition (essentially, which species live where) and decreased local diversity, researchers found. On average, the number of species at human-impacted sites was almost 20% lower than at sites unaffected by humans.Particularly severe losses were recorded among reptiles, amphibians and mammals, according to the paper. Their populations are often smaller than invertebrates, which increases the chances of extinction.The analysis covered five drivers of decline: habitat change, direct exploitation of resources (such as hunting or fishing), climate change, invasive species and pollution.François Keck, lead author and a postdoctoral researcher in Altermatt’s research group, said: “Our findings show that all five factors have a strong impact on biodiversity worldwide, in all groups of organisms and in all ecosystems.”View image in fullscreenDead fish on the Gulf of Mexico coastline in Texas in 2023, probably due to either pollution or low oxygen levels from warming seas – both human-linked problems.Photograph: Anadolu/GettyPollution and habitat changes, often driven by agriculture, have a particularly negative impact on biodiversity. Intensive agriculture – especially arable farming – involves large amounts of pesticides and fertilisers, which result in a decline of biodiversity, but also shifts the composition of species. The full extent of climate change and how it affects species is not entirely understood.While the overall effect of human intervention was negative, some ambiguities remained: human impact on wildlife varied by location, as did the degree to which biodiversity was homogenised by human activity, researchers said.Before this paper there had never been an attempt to combine findings from such a large number of biodiversity research studies examining humans’ impact everywhere on the planet and in all groups of organisms; most studies were limited to looking at either a single location or a specific human impact. This meant it was difficult to make general statements about the impacts of human activity on biodiversity, researchers say.Keck said: “It’s not just the number of species that is declining. Human pressure is also changing the composition of species communities.”In mountainous areas, for example, specialised plants are being replaced by those that typically grow at lower altitudes. This process is known as the “elevator to extinction” as high-altitude plants have nowhere else to go. This could mean that while the number of species might remain the same, the diversity is reduced.“Bending the curve of contemporary biodiversity loss and change is one of the greatest challenges facing our society,” the researchers stated. They said the paper should provide an “important benchmark” for the development and assessment of future conservation strategies.View image in fullscreenA hyacinth macaw flies over the Pantanal wetland in Brazil during devastating wildfires in 2020.

We actually see a modest increase in GDP growth, that may look small at first … but quickly grows.”Simon Stiell, the UN climate chief, also warned in a speech on Wednesday morning in Berlin that Europe would suffer economic devastation from the climate crisis, if strong action were not taken soon.Extreme weatherwould shave 1% from Europe’s GDP before mid-century, and by 2050 would shrink the economy by 2.3% a year.Although those figures may appear small, the crucial point is that the economic contraction would continue year after year. For comparison, the financial crisis of 2008-09 caused a contraction of 5.5% in the EU, but recovery began within a few years. The contraction owing to the climate crisis would be the equivalent of a serious recession occurring every year.By the end of two decades of such damage, the EU economy would cease to exist.“[Climate breakdown] is a recipe for permanent recession,” said Stiell. “As disasters make more and more regions unliveable, and food production declines, millions more people will be forced to migrate, internally and across borders.”He added: “The climate crisis is an urgent national security crisis that should be at the top of every cabinet agenda.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In the UK, the cost is likely to be 0.2% of GDP a year to 2050. Providingclimate finance to the poor world would also benefit rich countries.Data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena), published on Wednesday, found record-breaking growth last year of 15% in renewable energy capacity. Nearly two-thirds of the growth was from China, the world’s powerhouse of green energy generation.Francesco La Camera, the director general of Irena, said: “The continuous growth of renewables we witness each year is evidence that renewables are economically viable and readily deployable.”However, fossil fuels continue to attract investment. In 2023, about 1.5m new jobs were created in the global clean energy sector – but nearly 1m jobs were also added in the fossil fuel industry.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisClimate financeEconomicsOECDUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

They hastily renamed the resource to remove the word “climate” and quietly released it without fanfare in December, before Trump’s return to the White House.However, the unusual precautions taken by staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) weren’t enough to save the tool, which they had rebadged as the Future Risk Index.The newTrump administration, which haseliminated mentions of the climate crisisand its consequences across multiple government websites, deleted the index last month, dashing several years of work and with it hopes it would help cities, states and businesses across the US prepare for worsening storms, wildfires and floods.“We changed the name of it, removed mentions of emissions scenarios, tried to not get it any attention,” said a source familiar with the Fema project, who asked not to be named. “But it was taken down because there is now a fear of anything climate-related. There is such a culture of fear and uncertainty in Fema, people are worried about getting fired or defunded.”How we recreated the toolThe Guardian is now helping resurrect and display the short-lived tool, which was keenly awaited within Fema as the first free, localized resource showing how much climate change impacts will cost American communities.Drawing data from across federal government agencies, the index has county-by-county information on projected annual losses this century from threats includingextreme heat,coastal flooding,wildfires,hurricanesanddrought, all of which are worsened by human-caused global heating. Each county was also given an overall risk rating, which ranked how vulnerable its particular population is to climate shocks.Such information is crucial for planning by local governments, insurers, utilities and others that look to Fema to help contend with a growing list of disasters now rending American communities, according to Victoria Salinas, who was deputy administrator of resilience at Fema during Joe Biden’s administration.“It doesn’t matter if you call it climate change or not, the consequences are getting worse and so we were trying to play catch-up,” said Salinas.“If you’re making a decision about rebuilding a school, would you put it in the same place if it will flood again in 15 years? We have forced people to rebuild in the same places until now because we didn’t have this sort of data. Taking this information down really erodes the nation’s ability to keep communities safe and curtails effective disaster response.”Aside from the Future Risk Index, Trump’s Fema has also axed itsmain climate webpage, which called the climate crisis a “priority for emergency managers”, and expungeda pageon future conditions that acknowledges the consequences of global heating. The agency does retain the overallNational Risk Index, which shows current risk hazards across the US, but has stripped away anything that might be related to the climate crisis or diversity, equity and inclusion.“We’ve seen whole pages taken down that relate to hazard reduction for wildfires, things that shouldn’t be politicized, just because they mention climate change,” said the current Fema worker. “It’s all very intense and chaotic.”Four maps of the USThe Future Risk Index was initially restored to public viewbyFulton Ring, a software and data company. The company’s founders, Rajan Desai and Jeremy Herzog, said they were aghast at the Trump administration’s removal of online climate data and didn’t want taxpayer-funded work to go to waste.“We knew this was in the crosshairs because other tools like it have been shut down,” said Herzog. “We felt this would be a high-integrity action to take, more impactful than just protesting. People should be asking why these datasets are being taken down for political motivations.”US faces growing impacts of the climate crisisThe sidelining of climate concerns within Fema comes as the agency is increasingly strained by a growing number of catastrophes that are being fueled by rising global temperatures. Last yearwas the hottest ever recorded in the US and the world. America washit by 27 disasterscosting $1bn or more in damages, including twoenormoushurricanesthat ravaged large areas of the country’s south-east.Then, shortly before Trump took office in January, entire neighborhoods of Los Angeles were razed by wildfires that scientists said were worsened by the climate crisis. The president, however, has continued to call the climate crisis “a giant hoax” and has eventhreatened to dismantle Femaand hand over its functions to the states, whichexperts say could not foot the ballooning costsof disaster response and recovery.The Future Risk Index shows that such climate-driven impacts will only multiply if planet-heating emissions are not significantly cut. By the 2050s, counties in New Jersey, New York and Texas will be among those at the highest risk from coastal flooding, while the counties that contain Las Vegas, Nevada, Dallas, Texas and St Louis, Missouri, will be most vulnerable to extreme heat.Los Angeles, a site of January’s devastating wildfires, is among four places in California most at risk from fires by mid-century, the others being San Diego, Riverside and San Bernardino. Meanwhile counties in Florida, including Miami-Dade and Palm Beach, home of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, dominate the list of the most at-risk places from hurricanes by the mid-part of the century, if emissions are not cut.The projected losses affecting counties from climate-driven events could reach as much as $191m or more each year by mid-century, depending on a variety of conditions such as the path of hurricanes and wildfires and the trend of planet-heating emissions. The biggest losses are mostly anticipated in counties with high hurricane risk in states including Texas, Alabama, Florida, South Carolina and Louisiana.One bar chart, one line chartThe resurrected Future Risk Index provides a snapshot in time of these projected impacts, which will invariably alter as America’s population moves,often into harm’s way, and demographics evolve. Fema has ended work on updating the index to account for such changes.But the climate crisis is already being felt byits warping of the US’s insurance market, making it difficult or impossible for many homeowners to get insured and therefore a mortgage, and the increasing drumbeat of disasters that costs the economy about $150bn a year. Rising heat is also imperilingendangered species, prizedecosystemsand USfood security.“We need to better understand these risks so that we can plan to save lives and also save dollars,” said Michael Coen, a former chief of staff to the Fema administrator. “It’s reckless to take down information that can save lives without taking the time to understand the consequences. It makes me very concerned about the next four years.”Fema was approached for comment, but did not respond.MethodologyThe underlying data behind Fema’s Future Risk Index, last updated 2 December 2024, waspreserved by the data consultancy Fulton Ring. The index uses data from government and private organizations to project the changes in extreme weather events’ frequency and intensity across US counties. It calculates the relative risk and economic losses from these events under four climate scenarios.The losses are categorized in two ways, as projected annual losses and as projected risk ratings. In both cases, each county is sorted into a risk tier relative to other counties (from “very low” to “very high”). Projected annual losses factor in each weather event’s frequency and intensity and the number of human lives and physical assets at risk. To help compare areas’ future risk with their current risk fromFema’s National Risk Index, each counties’ average expected annual losses are placed in a static dollar range shared by the two indices. The other measure of losses, projected risk rating, includes the same estimate of economic losses due to extreme weather events’ impact on physical assets and loss of human lives, but it then factors in social vulnerability and community resilience. These social factors increase or decrease the estimated economic losses. The risk rating is not presented in dollar amounts because future social conditions are unpredictable and dollar estimates could be misleading.The climate scenarios include two time ranges, mid-century (2036 to 2065) and late-century (2070 to 2099), and two emission scenarios (lower and higher). The lower emission scenario (known asRCP 4.5)represents the most realistic,in which emissions peak around 2040but the Parisagreement climate policies are not met. The higher emissions scenario (known asRCP 8.5) is the “worst-case”,in which emissions increase throughout the century.The risk ratings for counties with no recorded incident of the weather event are categorized as “not applicable”. Those with no projected increase in risk, sometimes due to data issues, are categorized as “no rating”.The original index provided four different inputs to calculate risk for extreme heat events. For simplicity we chose to present one: temperatures in the 95th percentile and above using the Localized Constructed Analogs version 2 (LOCA2) data source.See the Future Risk Index’sfull technical documentation here."

The process will also lead to services at the Whittington, University College London, Barnet and North Middlesex hospitals being enhanced.Some but not all of the Royal Free’s maternity staff will be redeployed to those other hospitals.The North Central London integrated care board – which oversees theNHSin the five boroughs – said the trend meant it no longer needed all five hospitals to host births. It insisted that “the current arrangements cannot continue as they are” and that “this is the right direction in which to go.”.Dr Josephine Sauvage, a GP and medical director for the ICB’s Start Well maternity review, said the reconfiguration of care would provide “the best quality services for babies, children and parents – wherever they are – across our communities.“We have a declining birth rate in our areas and the need for more complex support for mothers, pregnant people and their babies is growing,” she added.The Royal Free is a teaching hospital and centre of excellence for various forms of medical care, including cancer, transplant surgery and infectious diseases.Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, whose Hampstead and Highgate constituency includes the Royal Free, said she was “dismayed” by the decision. “The most marginalised parents in my constituency” would lose out as a result of the closure, she added.“I know from my own experience that the hospital helps mothers with gestational diabetes,” said Siddiq, whose first child was born there by caesarean section.The maternity unit would close “eventually”, the ICB said. It did not give an exact date but it is likely to be later this decade.The Royal Free will also lose its special care baby unit when the maternity unit goes. The number of babies treated there has fallen by 4% every year since 2019/20 and in 2023/24 only 49% of its cots were occupied at any one time, which the ICB said was too few for staff to keep up their skills.The decision secures the future of the maternity unit at the Whittington hospital in Islington. The ICB had said they would shut it instead if they reprieved the Royal Free unit.Camden and Islington councils have both shut several primary schools in recent years in response to school rolls falling because of the birth rate.Edgware birth centre in Barnet will also close as part of the changes, again because too few babies are being born there – just 28 in 2023/24. It will host more antenatal and postnatal care instead.Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

In her witness statement she recalled another incident, not reported in the 2021-22 publications, which she said took place at the film’s wrap party.“Noel then came into the women’s toilets … I went into a cubicle and, as I went to close the door, Noel opened it and came into it after me. I was at the back of what was quite a very small cubicle and he leaned against the door, facing me and blocking the way out.“He pulled a condom out of his pocket and said something to the effect of: ‘How about it then.’ I said something about his wife and three kids, as I had seen them before on set. I can’t remember his response in precise words but it was something along the lines of: ‘I don’t care.’ His attitude in that moment changed. He went from friendly to defensive. I just felt huge pressure from him.“I can’t remember how I got out of the cubicle. He must have moved to the side or something and I pushed past and somehow I got away.”Philip Williams, representing Clarke, suggested Crabb had made up the incident and had not told the Guardian about it, citing a transcript of a conversation he said that she had with one of its journalists in which it was not mentioned.Crabb said she had told the Guardian but requested that it not be included in the article when she realised her name was going to be published.Another witness on Wednesday was Helen Atherton, a standby art director whose allegations also featured in the Guardian’s reporting. She said in her witness statement that Clarke had subjected her to relentless “looks, comments and gestures” about her bottom during her first two weeks on the set of Brotherhood.Asked by Williams why she did not simply say she did not like Clarke’s “bad jokes” immediately, Atherton replied: “Unfortunately I think a lot of women do put up with treatment like that in the film industry – but hopefully that is changing – and that’s why I didn’t confront him.”However, she told the court that such behaviour usually came from those in more junior positions. “I’ve never had any remarks from another director or someone in a hierarchy position,” Atherton told the court.Clarke admits commenting twice on her bottom but says he apologised and it was accepted.The court also heard from Synne Seltveit, a Norwegian friend of Clarke’s assistant producer, Gina Powell. Seltveit claims Clarke sent her an unsolicited picture on Snapchat of “a naked erect penis which I presumed was his” before her 2015 trip to the UK to see Powell.Williams questioned the timing, saying it did not make “any logical sense” that Clarke would message her before he had even met her. But Seltveit said it would have been easy to find her on Snapchat, adding: “He knew I was coming, he knew I was a good friend of Gina.”Her friend took a picture of the “dick pic”, which the metadata dates to 4 June 2015, the court heard.Williams said: “My client denies sending that picture and he denies that it’s his penis.”Explore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeGuardian Media GroupNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

Hands out. Hang on a sec. I’m going to put handcuffs on you, all right. You’re under arrest on suspicion of theft from a shop, all right. Because, I mean, Christ, what have you got in there?”De Groot replies “Creme Eggs” and the officer begins unzipping the shoplifter’s jacket. De Groot offers no resistance apart from saying “It’s all gonna fall out.”The officer pulls the boxes from his coat, telling the thief: “Christ, you’ve really loaded this up.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The tax loophole that turns old pubs into places of worshipRead moreOn Wednesday, during herspring statement, she raised the target to £7.5bn, a projection that won the blessing of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent body that vets the chancellor’s sums.Measures to close the “tax gap” include:Spending £100m on 500HMRCcompliance stafff£87m to improve HMRC’s debt collectionProsecuting 20% more tax fraudsters“Compensation” for whistleblowersReeves is also launching four consultations on how to further improve tax collection, including one aimed at “promoters” of avoidance schemes.Together, new proposals to close the tax gap will raise an extra £1.055bn by 2029-30, according to Treasury calculations, which was rubber-stamped by the OBR.The lion’s share of the sum, £715m, is slated to come from improved collection of overdue debts, including the hiring of 600 new compliance offers.A further £125m comes from increased penalties for late payment, £95m from hiring 500 extra staff to collect due debts – on top of 5,000 announced at the budget – and £125m from extending the digitisation of income tax collection to those earning more than £20,000, from 2028.But Reeves also fleshed out some of the methods the government will use to achieve its expanded target of closing the tax gap by £7.5bn within five years.They include an incentive scheme for whistleblowers, “rewarding informants with compensation linked to a percentage of any tax taken as a result of their action”.Like theSerious Fraud Office (SFO), which has also said it wants to reward whistleblowers, the Treasury appears to be following the example of the US, where informants are regularly paid a cut of funds collected thanks to their information.HMRC, Companies House and the Insolvency Service will target “phoenixisation”, where businesses use “contrived” insolvencies to evade tax and write off debts owed to others.HMRC is expanding its counter-fraud capability to increase the number of prosecutions for the most harmful fraud by 20% by 2029-30, compared with current levels, from 500 to 600 a year.Since Labour took office, the Guardian has revealed details of financial advisers offering avoidance schemesto the super-richandproperty owners.Explore more on these topicsTax avoidanceHMRCTax and spendingRachel ReevesSpring statement 2025newsShareReuse this content"

After that decision, individuals connected to the athletes commissioned a legal opinion from Blackstone Chambers.The KC-led report produced by four barristers at Blackstone, says: “We believe that there are strong grounds to challenge the lawfulness of the decisions, as regards the Interpretation Panel’s jurisdiction to make them in the first place, the substantive outcome, and the procedure that the Interpretation Panel appears to have adopted.”Cambridge remain deeply aggrieved at Oxford’s conduct, particularly as they claim OUBC have not responded to any communication from them or the university throughout the saga. OUBC have not responded to requests for comment.With just over two weeks until the race Cambridge have no plans to act on the legal opinion at this stage as mounting a legal challenge would be time-consuming and potentially disruptive to the squad, but they are reserving all options for the future. The three students involved have reluctantly accepted their fate, prioritising the success of the squad over their own personal ambitions.The interpretation panel, which is chaired by the corporate finance lawyer Ian Hodgson and comprises representatives from each club, made its initial decision after Oxford’s complaint in December before overturning it when Cambridge appealed in January.After Cambridge named Heywood, Foxell and Crowley in their crews in February, Oxford challenged their selection again on the grounds that schedule 2 of the joint agreement between the clubs governing the race states that the interpretation panel’s decisions are “binding, final and unappealable”.View image in fullscreenCambridge are aggrieved at Oxford’s conduct, claiming OUBC has not responded to any communication from them.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAfter this submission, the panel reverted to its original decision, despite having previously accepted that it was flawed.The legal opinion from Blackstone outlines three areas in which the lawfulness of the panel’s decisions could be challenged relating to its jurisdiction, the substantive outcome and the procedures used. The interpretation panel is accused of failing to observe the timescales set out in the joint agreement so that individual competitors and their teams have clarity on any issues of eligibility well in advance of the race.

Both clubs have regularly selected PGCE students, with Julia Robey, now deputy head of sixth form at King’s college school, Wimbledon, racing for Oxford in 2017.Finally, the KC-led review asserts that the interpretation panel’s work is procedurally unfair. The students were not informed their involvement was being challenged, were not given any opportunity to represent themselves and have still not received any documentation regarding the decision.The decision to ban PGCE students has been described as “an insult to teachers” by Imogen Grant, the reigning Olympic lightweight double sculls champion, who won the women’s Boat Race with Cambridge in 2017, 2018 and 2022. There are also widespread concerns that women will be disproportionately affected, as according to a teacher training census conducted by gov.uk, 68% of PGCE entrants across all universities in 2024-25 are female.A PGCE is only required to teach in the state sector, with Heywood, Foxell and Crowley all working at state schools in Cambridgeshire in addition to their studies. “This is an insult to teachers everywhere and a desperate ploy from Oxford,” Grant said.“I don’t believe this reflects on the current Oxford squad, who have also had to train among this uncertainty all year. I believe this is entirely down to select individuals among the alumni who have a narrow, outdated view of who rows boat races.”Explore more on these topicsThe Boat RaceRowingUniversity of CambridgeUniversity of OxfordnewsShareReuse this content"

The terms of settlement are confidential.”Rose said in her statement in 2023 that she made a“serious error of judgment”during a conversation with Simon Jack, the BBC News business editor, in which she confirmed the bank had taken a “commercial decision” in shutting Farage’s Coutts accounts and offering him a NatWest account.It was subsequently reported by the BBC that Farage had been expelled from the bank because its customers were required to hold £3m in savings, or to borrow or invest £1m.She added: “Put simply, I was wrong to respond to any question raised by the BBC about this case. I want to extend my sincere apologies to Mr Farage for the personal hurt this has caused him.”NatWest laterscrapped almost £7.6m in potential payouts to Rose.Explore more on these topicsBankingNigel FarageNatWest GroupReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

It gives patients and their loved ones the right to request an urgent review of the person receiving hospital treatment, which triggers their care being looked at by a team of specialists, who offer a second opinion.Prof Sir Stephen Powis, NHS England’s national medical director, said the initiative “is already one of the most significant changes in patient safety in recent years, with hundreds of calls leading to improvements in patient care – and undoubtedly lives saved”.Martha died of sepsis after doctors at King’s College hospital in Londondid not move her to its intensive care unit, despite her parents voicing serious concern about her care.Martha’s mother, Merope, a senior editor at the Guardian, said patients have contacted her family to describe how the lives of their loved ones have been saved thanks to the rule.She said: “I’m very pleased with the progress that has been made with the implementation of Martha’s rule.“More than 100 people escalated to ICU [intensive care unit] or equivalent is a really significant number and I’ve heard directly from people who feel a family member’s life has been saved in this way, including an NHS nurse who was struggling to have her voice heard.

Everyone needs to have access to this service, which is changing NHS culture by giving patients more power, costs very little but has a huge impact.”So far,143 hospitals in Englandhave signed up to the Martha’s rule pilot scheme.Hughes told the select committee: “We’ve had over 2,000 calls [under the scheme], which have led to more than 300 patients having an improvement in their care and over 100 ending up being escalated to ITU [intensive therapy unit] or equivalent.“I think it really shows that the patients and families have really valuable information that we can listen to, and if we act on that, then we improve safety and we reduce harm to patients, but also we improve things like staff morale, reduce numbers of complaints, etc.”Powis said: “Patients or their loved ones are often best placed to spot signs of deterioration, and I know everyone across the NHS is grateful to Martha’s parents, Merope and Paul, for their tireless campaigning and ongoing work with us on the rollout.”Rachel Power, the chief executive of the Patients Association, applauded the early success of Martha’s rule.She said: “[This] clearly demonstrates the power of giving people a clear, accessible route to be heard when they’ve noticed the signs of deterioration.“We’re continuing to call for Martha’s rule to be rolled out across the entire NHS to ensure that every patient, in every hospital, has access to this potentially life-saving measure.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHospitalsDoctorsEnglandHealthSepsisnewsShareReuse this content"

All of the addresses that were specifically targeted were described as “legitimate businesses who allow people to book online (eg Airbnb, Booking.com etc.)”Walthamstow residents whose houses were splattered with paint earlier this month had told the Guardian that they had received letters from the apparent culprits claiming that specific addresses were being targeted.Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, wrote to the Home Office last weekcalling for an investigationinto what appears to be a series of similar incidents across English cities.She said on Wednesday: “I’ve been told by the police that they now recognise six linked attacks and are investigating a connection to organised crime - I am concerned there have been many more and would appeal to others who have had this happen to come forward.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The MPs on the bill who do not support assisted dying have frequently claimed that their suggestions to make the bill safer were outvoted.Announcing the end of the committee process, Leadbeater said it had made “already the strongest assisted dying legislation anywhere in the world even safer and more robust”, citing changes made including mandatory training for doctors and panel members to detect coercion and a guarantee that anybody considering an assisted death would be made fully aware of all end-of-life care options.But the bill’s critics, in their letter to MPs, said there was “reckless and loose language in the bill” that undermined the founding principles of the NHS. They said there were insufficient protections for children, people with anorexia, people with mental health conditions, those with learning difficulties or victims of domestic and financial abuse.They also criticised ministers involved in the process for giving no impact assessments or indications of the costs of the service and no guarantee of improvements to palliative care to ensure a real choice.Among the other concerns raised by MPs was the prospect that doctors would still be allowed to proactively suggest assisted dying to patients who had not raised it themselves and the potential for the private sector to make a profit from the legislation.“Our efforts have not succeeded in improving the bill and we cannot recommend a vote in favour of it,” the MPs said. “It is our hope that the bill will not progress in its current form, and that a better way can be found to take forward the vital conversation about choice at the end of life.“But a flawed and dangerous bill that places the most vulnerable people in society at unacceptable risk is no choice at all, and we urge MPs to vote against it.”Leadbeater said in her statement that the “status quo is failing dying people and their families”. She said there was “particular care to protect the disabled and the vulnerable and to ensure that only those with a genuine, settled and informed wish to be assisted to die in the manner of their choosing are able to do so”.She said she hoped that there would be confidence in her plan for a multi-disciplinary panel to replace high court judges. “We are not removing judges from this process. Rather, we are adding the expertise and experience of psychiatrists and social workers to provide extra protections in the areas of assessing mental capacity and detecting coercion while retaining judicial oversight,” she said.Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingDeath and dyingLabourHouse of CommonsnewsShareReuse this content"

At least one appeal to join the protest was circulating on the social media network Telegram.“I don’t know who organised the protest,” one man told Agence France-Press. “I took part to send a message on behalf of the people: enough with the war.” He said he had seen “members of the Hamas security forces in civilian clothing breaking up the protest”.A statement released by family elders from Beit Lahiya expressed support for the protests against Israel’s offensive and its tightened blockade. They also said the community fully supported armed resistance against Israel and rejected “any attempt to exploit legitimate popular demands by a fifth column”, apparently referring to opponents of Hamas.In a separate development on Wednesday, at least nine Palestinians were killed by two separate Israeli airstrikes in central Gaza, medics said.One strike hit a group of Palestinians gathered outside a charity providing hot meals in the Nuseirat refugee camp. At least five people, including a woman and her adult daughter, were killed by the strike, according to the al-Awda hospital, which received the casualties.The resumption of Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip had displaced 142,000 people in seven days, the UN said on Wednesday, warning of dwindling stocks of humanitarian aid.“In just one week, 142,000 people have been displaced,” the spokesperson for the UN secretary-general, António Guterres, said, adding that about 90% of Gaza’s population had been displaced at least once between the start of the war on 7 October 2023 and January of this year.There has been no sign that Israel will open entry points to allow essential aid to flow or ease itsnew offensive.The Gaza health ministry said more than 50,000 Palestinians had been killed in Gaza and another 113,408 wounded since the beginning of the war.AFP, Reuters and AP contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesBenjamin NetanyahuHamasnewsShareReuse this content"

Among the recipients of the messages was a prominent journalist, who was inadvertently added to the group.“This is very worrying.Canadaneeds to think about what this means in practical terms: is the United States prepared to protect our secrets, as we are bound to protect theirs?” said Richard Fadden, the former head of Canada’s intelligence agency. “Every country has experienced leaks, of varying severity. The problem with this one is that it’s being generated at the highest levels of the US government – and they haven’t admitted that it’s a problem.”Latest Signal leak revelations expose US officials’ lies about what was sharedRead moreCanada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia andNew Zealandhave for decades shared intelligence in a pact informally known as the Five Eyes. But the leak of classified information is likely to put further strain on the group as it weighs how seriously the current American administration takes the handling of top secret information.“When we have intelligence leaks, we admit it, we try to sort out what’s happened and we try to fix it. One doesn’t get the impression today that the US cabinet members will admit there’s a problem,” said Fadden, who also served as national security adviser to Canada’s Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper. “They’re just trying to clean it up from a political perspective. That worries me.”Despite a far more detailed picture of the information leaked to the journalist Jeffrey Goldberg, the White House and key figures in the message thread have redoubled efforts to claim none of the information was classified.View image in fullscreenRichard Fadden in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, in 2021.Photograph: James Park/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesThe Pentagon chief,Pete Hegseth, said on Tuesday that “nobody was texting war plans” in the thread. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, wrote on social media “these were NOT ‘war plans’. This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin.”“No locations. No sources & methods. NO WAR PLANS,” national secruity adviser Mike Waltz wrote on X. “Foreign partners had already been notified that strikes were imminent. BOTTOM LINE: President Trump is protecting America and our interests.”Fadden disputed the “cleanup exercise” by the current administration.“This is intelligence, and it should be kept confidential. It would be useful if somebody in the US administration admitted they made a mistake, acknowledged there were problems, but that on the sharing of critical intelligence, wanted the current relationships to continue,” he said. “I don’t think that is the kind of thing the administration is inclined to do. There are ways to lower the temperature. Their lack of willingness to do that makes it worse.”The use of Signal by senior members of theTrump administrationhas also become a focus of the leak. The commercial messaging app is popular among journalists for its sophisticated encryption but cannot be download on devices issued by the federal government, meaning those involved in the discussions were probably using private phones.“It may well be that Signal is easier, but that’s not the issue. When you join government, you have to accept some sort of restrictions,” said Fadden. “Even though Signal is quite good in terms of encrypting, that doesn’t mean that people who are wandering around with their iPhones can’t be hacked. That is worrying.”The revelations came asCanadagrapples with a rapidly deteriorating relationship with the United States, its largest trading partner and closest military ally.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I would like to think that on things like the sharing of critical intelligence, we would be able to survive.”But Fadden suggests the nature of the leaks – and the denials – will provoke intense conversations among US allies.“Should we think more carefully about what we call ‘Canadian eyes only’ intelligence, or should we continue to share very, very broadly? I imagine that United Kingdom and Australia,New Zealandwill go through the same sort of exercise. The Five Eyes will survive this. But over the short to medium term, it probably will mean a few adjustments.”Canada’s department of national defence declined to comment on the leaks.Explore more on these topicsCanadaUS national securityTrump administrationPete HegsethDonald TrumpUS militaryNew ZealandnewsShareReuse this content"

Boasberg temporarily blocked the Alien Enemies Act deportations later on 15 March following a legal challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union.But the Trump administration allowed two planes already in the air to continue toEl Salvador, where the US handed 238 Venezuelan men over to Salvadoran authorities to be placed in the country’s “terrorism confinement center”.The ruling came as Kristi Noem, the US secretary of homeland security, arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to visit amega-prisonholding theVenezuelans deportedby the US. Noem, an outspoken proponent of Trump’s immigration crackdown, also plans to meet with El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, whose Trump-aligned government is holding the Venezuelans in exchange for $6m.Family members of many of the deported Venezuelan immigrants deny the alleged gang ties. Lawyers for one of the deportees, a Venezuelan professional soccer player and youth coach, said US officials had wrongly labeled him a gang memberbased on a tattooof a crown meant to honor his favorite team, Real Madrid. In explaining her decision to uphold Boasberg’s ruling, the US circuit judge Patricia Millett, an appointee of Barack Obama, said the government was not affording the immigrants the chance to contest the government’s assertion that they were members of Tren de Aragua before deporting them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Drew Ensign, a lawyer for Trump, responded: “We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy.“US circuit judge Karen Henderson, an appointee of George HW Bush, said it was not clear that Tren de Aragua’s presence in the United States constituted an act of war as contemplated by the Alien Enemies Act.“An invasion is a military affair, not one of migration,” Henderson wrote in her ruling on Wednesday. Ensign argued on Monday that the judge had no right to second-guess the president’s decision on foreign affairs matters. In a dissenting opinion, Walker wrote: “The Government likely faces irreparable harm to ongoing, highly sensitive international diplomacy and national-security operations.” Walker also said he would have halted Boasberg’s ban because the proper forum for the immigrants to have brought the case was Texas, where they are detained, rather than Washington DC.The Trump administration may ask the US supreme court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, to review the case. Boasberg is separately weighing whether the Trump administration violated his order by failing to return deportation flights after his order was issued.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationVenezuelaUS politicsTrump administrationEl SalvadorLaw (US)AmericasShareReuse this content"

People who push themselves when working out report a form of time warp, making it feel as if they have been exercising for longer than they have, researchers say.Adults who took part in 4km cycling trials on exercise bikes perceived time to have slowed down, scientists said, with the cyclists overestimating how long they had been pedalling for by about 10%.The finding suggests people who are trying to improve their fitness might feel their workouts are shorter and more enjoyable if they are distracted from the intensity of the activity by listening to music or training in a more competitive setting.“People perceive time as moving more slowly during exercise,” said Andrew Edwards, a professor of psychology at Canterbury Christ Church University in Kent, and the first author on the study. “This distortion may affect pacing and the enjoyment of physical activity.”Three-quarters of gym-goers report boost in mental health, report saysRead moreIn the study, 33 physically active adults took part in three cycling trials on an exercise bike. Before, during and after the trial, they were asked to estimate a time period of 30 seconds. The first trial was performed solo. The second was accompanied by a virtual avatar on the bike’s screen. And on the third trial, they were told to beat the virtual opponent.Writing inBrain and Behaviour, the researchers described how time appeared to run slow when people were exercising but not before or after. The effect was the same across the trials, suggesting the virtual opponent had no noticeable impact.The time warp does not seem to be specific to cycling, but linked to the intensity of the exercise or how uncomfortable it feels, Edwards said. What drives the shift in time perception is not clear, but he believes that at high intensities, exercise makes the body more aware of the pain it is enduring, making the duration feel longer.“Exercise, particularly hard exercise, increases focus on the body, creating a heightened awareness of each moment,” he said. “That makes time feel like it’s dragging.”The researchers compared the effect to Einstein’s special theory of relativity, which said time was not absolute and depended on the observer’s frame of reference. In 1929, Einstein was claimed to have said: “When you sit with a nice girl for two hours you think it’s only a minute, but when you sit on a hot stove for a minute you think it’s two hours. That’s relativity.”“This study is the first to experimentally demonstrate that time and relativity can be demonstrated through the medium of exercise … showing that time is distorted,” the authors wrote.The intensity of the exercise may not be the only factor. Infollow-up researchon professional footballers, Edwards found that training sessions involving a football seemed to pass more quickly than cardio training and video analysis sessions.“If time feels slower, workouts may feel longer and less enjoyable. Making exercise more engaging could help people stick with it,” Edwards said. “Repetitive or unenjoyable exercise might enhance this time-slowing effect, while distractions or enjoyment might reduce it.”Explore more on these topicsScienceHealthFitnessPeer review and scientific publishingResearchAlbert EinsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

Then came the cutsRead moreThe team called for countries to instigate innovative financing strategies and integrate HIV services into wider health systems.Campaigners said the study should prompt a rethink of plans to cut aid. Anne Aslett , of the Elton John Aids Foundation, said: “This report demonstrates the critical and urgent need for donors to recognise the cumulative impact of their decisions to cut aid budgets.“If funding for the global HIV response falls away to the extent this report suggests it could, millions more people will get sick, and health budgets will simply not be able to cope.”Meanwhile, Save the Children warned that UK aid cuts would see deaths linked to malnutrition rise worldwide.

Guardian Australia has not been able to identify the woman and man seen handing the letter to politicians.The event was hosted by the deputy chair of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, Andrew Wallace, to celebrate the launch of the Australia-Israel Allies Caucus – a group of mostly Coalition members critical of the federal government’s approach toward Israel.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe letter, addressed to Wallace, a Queensland LNP backbencher, urged the caucus members to ditch bipartisan support for a two-state solution, which would see Palestine recognised internationally as a state, saying it would “benefit” both Australia and Israel.“While Australia’s main political parties formally continue to endorse two states, Israel’s political representatives and public have long opposed such a plan,” the letter said.“Especially since the October 7th massacre, it is clear that the creation of a Palestinian state would mean the destruction of the state of Israel.”Its signatories included far-right members of Israel’s parliament, including Ohad Tal of theReligious Zionism partyand Almog Cohen ofOtzma Yehudit, or “Jewish Power”, as well as Amit Halevi from Netanyahu’s Likud party. Tal tweeted the letter from his X account in February.“The consequences of October 7th must include the deletion of the two-state option rather than rewarding the savages who committed the massacre,” the letter continued.Australia splits with US to back UN resolution demanding end to Israel occupation of Palestinian territoriesRead more“A Palestinian state would serve the sole, defining, antisemitic goal of Palestinian nationalism: the eradication of the Jewish state.“Ahead of the federal elections in Australia, we call on the various political parties to remove the two-state paradigm from their party platforms. Such a move would send a strong message of support and friendship to Israel and to Jewish Australians. It would also express a commitment to common sense, justice, and peace in Israel in the region.”Guardian Australia attended the event in February and requested a copy of the letter but was denied. A Liberal staff member described it at the time as “letters of encouragement” from Israeli politicians. It’s understood Wallace allowed the individuals to distribute the letters to politicians in attendance.Wallace said he supported Australia’s bipartisan policy of a two-state solution in Israel and Palestine when asked in February. He did not respond to a request for further comment this week.The Israeli ambassador, Amir Maimon, gave an off-the-record speech at the meeting, but the embassy said it had no involvement in distributing the letter.Several Liberal and National MPs and senators were in attendance, including shadow ministers James Paterson, Sarah Henderson, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price and Claire Chandler. The former Labor MP Mike Kelly also attended.A spokesperson for the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said the government maintained its longstanding commitment to a Palestinian state and the state of Israel, “living side by side in peace and security, within internationally recognised borders”.“It is for the Liberal MPs and senators who received the letter to explain whether they still support this longstanding, bipartisan Australian government policy,” the spokesperson said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The latest conflict was triggered by an attack by Hamas militants in Israel in October 2023, in which they killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostages.Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

He did not confirm the death of the four US soldiers, but noted that the details remain unconfirmed,” the Nato acting spokesperson, Allison Hart, later told AFP.The Lithuanian army said earlier there was “no evidence or information confirming the death of the troops”.“People [are] working round the clock. Everybody remains on standby, ready to provide emergency medical support,” the Lithuanian defence minister, Dovilė Šakalienė, said on X.Lithuanian authorities received a report about the soldiers’ disappearance on Tuesday afternoon.US Army Europe and Africa’s public affairs office confirmed in its statement that the soldiers “were conducting scheduled tactical training at the time of the incident”.“I would like to personally thank the Lithuanian armed forces and first responders who quickly came to our aid in our search operations,” said Lt Gen Charles Costanza, the V Corps commanding general.More than 1,000 American troops are stationed in Lithuania on a rotational basis.Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are all Nato members and have often had chilly ties with Russia, a key ally of Belarus, since declaring independence from the Soviet Union in 1990.Relations soured further over Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and the Lithuanian president, Gitanas Nausėda, has been one of the most outspoken supporters of Ukraine in its fight against the forces of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.Explore more on these topicsUS militaryLithuaniaNatoEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Not for Europe or North America,” said the Dutch head of the alliance. “The global security challenges are too great for any of us to face on our own. When it comes to keeping Europe and North America safe, there is no alternative toNato.”Europe “needs to know that Uncle Sam still has our back”, Rutte continued, but in turn “America also needs to know that its Nato allies will step up. Without restrictions and without capability gaps” because “reassurance is a two-way street”.In defiance of Donald Trump, is a European ‘security council’ emerging? | Paul TaylorRead moreThe 76-year-old alliance has come under intense pressure following the election of Donald Trump, most recently with key administration memberscomplaining about European defence “free-loading” in a confidential chat on the Signal app that leaked when a journalist from the Atlantic was added to the group by mistake.On his first trip to Europe earlier this year, Pete Hegseth, the new defence secretary, said the US was no longer “primarily focused” on European security and signalled that cuts to the number of American troops in Europe were a possibility.Since then,some reports had suggestedthat the US was willing to relinquish its hold on the position of Nato’s top military commander, the supreme allied commander Europe (Saceur), a position first held by Dwight Eisenhower and currently held by Gen Christopher Cavoli, whose tour expires in the summer.One Nato source said that idea had been dropped. A second said the UK was particularly keen to ensure the US remains inside the alliance at a time when any sustained end to the fighting in Ukraine could allow Russia to distribute 600,000 troops elsewhere along member states’ eastern flank.On Friday last week, Trump himself appeared to dismiss the speculation. When asked directly about the US being prepared to give up the top military command, he replied that the alliance was “gone until I came along” before praising Rutte, his predecessor and European members for increasing defence spending.“Nato is solid, is strong but they have to treat us fairly,” the US president added.Another report suggested Europe’s leading military powers wanted to devise a plan toshift the financial and military burden to European capitalsover the next five to 10 years and present it to the US, amid worries about whether Washington would come to the defence of Europe in a crisis.However, this idea was dismissed by British sources who argued that the idea that the US contribution to European security could be replaced in five years or so was “living in cloud cuckoo land”.Rutte said he recognised that “the US commitment to Nato comes with a clear expectation” and “that European allies and Canada take more responsibility for our shared security”. He said he would work towards developing this at the next leaders’ summit in The Hague in June.Nato members have begun to announce some increases in defence spending, with the UK promising to lift its budget from 2.33% of GDP to 2.5% by 2027, starting with an extra £2.2bn next year. Germany has agreed to loosen its debt rules to allow for additional spending on defence under the incoming chancellor, Friedrich Merz.Explore more on these topicsNatoMark RutteTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsEuropeDefence policyShareReuse this content"

Police claim one sub-plot – code-named “Green and Yellow Dagger” – included plans to cause social and political chaos by assassinating Lula with poison and shooting the supreme court judgeMoraesdead.Brazil’s attorney general, Paulo Gonet, told the court police investigators had “uncovered a terrifying operation to carry out the coup, which even included killing the president and vice-president elect, as well as that of a supreme court minister”.One assassination plot “envisaged using explosives, military ordnance and poison … [and] the operators only didn’t follow through on what had been agreed because they didn’t manage to … co-opt the commander of the army,” Gonet added, urging judges to put Bolsonaro and his alleged accomplices on trial.Bolsonaro rejected the charges in a lengthy WhatsApp statement sent to allies as the hearing began on Tuesday, calling the case against him “an aberration, the like of which has never been seen before”. “They are accusing me of a crime I never committed – a supposed attempted coup,” Bolsonaro claimed, insisting he had never desired or suggested “a democratic rupture”.In a written statement after Wednesday’s ruling, Bolsonaro claimed he was the victim of judicial persecution designed to end his political career and silence Brazil’s rightwing opposition.“Those in power are focused on ensuring I spend the rest of my life in prison so I can never run for president again,” he wrote.“The Brazilian people are being robbed of their right to choose their leader, and no country can call itself a democracy when its most popular candidate is barred from the ballot through judicial maneuvers,” Bolsonaro added.In court, lawyers for the accused also denied their clients had broken the law, although many stopped short of denying a coup attempt had taken place.Bolsonaro’s lawyer, Celso Vilardi, denied the ex-president had been involved in the 8 January uprising or led a criminal organization that plotted to murder Lula and other top authorities.José Luis Mendes de Oliveira Lima, a lawyer representing Braga Netto, called his client “a man of unblemished reputation” who was not guilty of “any kind of criminal act”.Oliveira’s lawyer, Andrew Fernandes Faris, called the former defense minister “a most honourable man”, and called for the charges against him to be thrown out.The lawyer for Torres, Eumar Novacki, denied his client was part of the “macabre coup drama” and claimed the investigation was filled with “false conclusions”.Demóstenes Torres, representing Santos, also denied his client was part of the plot and attacked the “federal police novelists” he claimed had concocted a fictional narrative about the supposed conspiracy.Ramagem’s lawyer, Paulo Renato Garcia Cintra Pinto, said it would have made no sense for his client to have tried to destroy Brazil’s democracy since he had himself just been elected to congress in the 2022 election.Bernardo Mello Franco, a political commentator for the newspaper O Globo, said he saw little chance of the ex-president avoiding jail. “Bolsonaro will probably be convicted, Bolsonaro will probably be arrested – or he’ll go into exile, he’ll flee the country … From a judicial standpoint Bolsonaro’s cornered,” he said.Bolsonaro’s best chance of a “political resurrection” lay in helping elect a rightwing ally in next year’s presidential election who would agree to pardoning him after taking power. His congressman son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, and wife, Michelle Bolsonaro, were possible candidates.The far-right populist was also banking on support from his most important foreign ally, the US president, Donald Trump, in his quest to avoid jail and ensure his political survival.“Bolsonaro is hoping Trump will be a kind of saviour for him, both politically and judicially. He believes Trump will somehow interfere in Brazilian politics to help him,” said Mello Franco, although he suspected Trump had bigger fish to fry.“Right now, I think Trump seems to have greater priorities than Brazil … [and that] the Bolsonaros are paying more attention to Trump than Trump is paying to Bolsonaro.”Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Last Friday, Columbiagave into the Trump administration by agreeing to a series of demands in order to restore $400m in federal funding. These changes include crackdowns on protests, increased security power and “internal reviews” of some academic programs, like the Middle Eastern studies department.“When I saw Columbia completely capitulate, and I saw this vocabulary of, well, we’re going to work behind the scenes because we’re not going to get targeted – that whole way of thinking pre-supposes that some universities will get targeted, and you don’t want to be one of those universities, and that’s just a losing strategy,” he said.Stanley added: “You’ve got to just band together and say an attack on one university is an attack on all universities. And maybe you lose that fight, but you’re certainly going to lose this one if you give up before you fight.”“Columbia was just such a warning,” he said. “I just became very worried because I didn’t see a strong enough reaction in other universities to side with Columbia. I see Yale trying not to be a target. And as I said, that’s a losing strategy.”Stanley said he wasn’t concerned about his ability to continue his scholarship at Yale, but the broader climate against universities played a role. He praised other faculty at Yale for standing up against the attacks on their profession and said he wished he could stay and fight with them.“But how could you speak out loudly if you’re not an American citizen?” he questioned. “And if you can’t speak out loudly if you’re not an American citizen, when will they come for the American citizens? It’s inevitable.”Social media posts spread on Wednesday, noting the alarm sounded by a scholar of fascism leaving the country over its political climate. Nikole Hannah-Jones, the journalist and creator of the 1619 project,wroteon the social media platform Bluesky: “When scholars of authoritarianism and fascism leave US universities because of the deteriorating political situation here, we should really worry.”In a statement, Yale said it remains a “home to world-class faculty members who are dedicated to excellence in scholarship and teaching”.“Yale is proud of its global faculty community which includes faculty who may no longer work at the institution, or whose contributions to academia may continue at a different home institution,” the university said. “Faculty members make decisions about their careers for a variety of reasons and the university respects all such decisions.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Stanley said this order sets the country “on a path to educational authoritarianism”.He said he considered leaving the US in 2017, but that the second Trump administration has “definitely” proven worse than the first. Stanley’s profile has also risen since then after the publication of several books on propaganda and fascism. The Munk school is building a program with the view that there’s an “international struggle against democracy” and provides a “very exciting intellectual opportunity”, he said.“I don’t see it as fleeing at all,” he said. “I see it as joiningCanada, which is a target of Trump, just like Yale is a target of Trump.”What does it say that a scholar of fascism is leaving the US right now? Said Stanley: “Part of it is you’re leaving because ultimately, it is like leaving Germany in 1932, 33, 34. There’s resonance: my grandmother left Berlin with my father in 1939. So it’s a family tradition.”Explore more on these topicsUS universitiesYale UniversityCanadaUS politicsHigher educationAmericasCensorshipShareReuse this content"

They will be joined by other X-Men stars including Kelsey Grammer, Rebecca Romijn, James Marsden and Alan Cumming.Channing Tatum, who had been set to lead a standalone Gambit film, will also star, having recently played the role in Deadpool & Wolverine.Elizabeth Olsen, who plays the Scarlet Witch, recentlyconfirmedthat she will not be joining the cast.At last year’s San Diego Comic-Con, it was revealed that Iron Man star Robert Downey Jr would be joining the film to play the villain Doctor Doom. “New mask. Same task,” Downey Jr said to the crowd. “Boy, I tell you, I like playing complicated characters.”The film will be directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, who have previously directed four films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Their last film for the studio wasAvengers: Endgamein 2019, which made over $2.79bn worldwide.“The only thing I’ll say about the movie is this: we love villains who think they are the heroes of their own stories,” Joe Russosaidin a recent interview.“That’s when they become three-dimensional and when they become more interesting. And when you have an actor like Robert Downey Jr, youhaveto create a well-shaped, three-dimensional character for the audience. That’s where a lot of our focus is going.”Their most recent film, The Electric State, landed on Netflix earlier this month to negative reviews. The Guardian’s Peter Bradshawcalledit “very bland and derivative”.Earlier this year, Captain America: Brave New World made $401m worldwide after 2023’s The Marvels underperformed with $206m.Avengers: Doomsday just began production in London and is scheduled for release in May 2026.Explore more on these topicsSuperhero moviesMarvelIan McKellenAvengers: EndgamePatrick StewartPaul RuddChris HemsworthnewsShareReuse this content"

She discusses social media censorship, sexuality, crying on stage – and her magical childhoodWed 26 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 26 Mar 2025 06.07 EDTShare‘Ihad an epiphany recently,”FKA twigssays. You have to love a conversation that starts like that. “Where I sit in the industry now is where I sat when I was at school. I was a little bit of an outsider then. And I thought, if I did this job, I’d be on the inside. But after 15 years of doing it, I just found myself still on the outside.”FKA twigs’ appearance is mysterious: the 37-year-old has wise eyes, seemingly as old as a mountain, but the skin of a 14-year-old; her head is shaved at the side, like an ecowarrior, yet she is ridiculously beautiful, like a Disney princess. Her singing voice is otherworldly and she has incredible range. People have always compared her to Björk, but the first song onher new album, Eusexua, gives a bit of texture to that comparison. Yes, they are alike, in the sense that they are both from outer space. But space is quite large.“Ethereal” is a word often spoken about – and by – FKA twigs, so maybe that is what sets her apart. She considers this and shrugs. “It’s hard to tell when you’re inside yourself why it is.”We meet in the cafe at the Barbican in London, where later she is going to see Chekhov’s The Seagull. Born and raised in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, and privately educated on a scholarship, Tahliah Debrett Barnett, as she once was, comes across as much more global than spa town, having taken a circuitous but effective route to the centre of everything.View image in fullscreen‘I’m very ferocious’ … FKA twigs.Photograph: Jordan HemingwayThe other phrase people use about FKA twigs is “avant garde”, but what do they mean? Is it something simple, as in her visual style is highly theatrical, not sexy in any regular sense of the word? Is it something more complicated, as in her music defies classification, not because it doesn’t fit neatly into any genre, but because you can’t really do anything – dance, have it on in the background, whistle – except concentrate on it? Is it because she often names her records the way Elon Musk names his children: all letters, no sounds (EP1, in 2012; LP1, in 2014; M3LL155X, in 2015)?She left Cheltenham to go to the Brit school in Croydon for sixth form, but had been getting professional gigs as a dancer since she was 12. By her early 20s, she was an incredibly successful backup dancer, working with musicians including Kylie Minogue, Jessie J and Ed Sheeran. She would perform her music anywhere and everywhere, sometimes for money, sometimes for the craic; the legend is that she got signed by an A&R guy who spotted her at a bondage club.The way she describes it, she was much more perfectionist and grafter than party girl: “I had four jobs. In the evening, I would go and perform in pubs; if I was lucky, I’d get 15 quid. The line might be six people; sometimes no one turned up. It didn’t really profit me anything. It’s a choice, isn’t it? Do I want to spend 50 quid going out with my mates and getting pissed at the weekend, or do I want to spend it on a room to rehearse in with my band?”It wasn’t a bondage club: it was a warehouse party co-sponsored by a tattoo artist and a fetishwear brand. It was there she met Tic, the Ghanaian hip-hop artist with whom she co-wrote EP1. “Now,he’sethereal,” she says. “Ethereal and ephemeral.” Has he vanished now? “He’s vanished many times and turned up again.”“I entered my career at the height of Pop Idol,” she says. “It was a new era of finding people off the street and manufacturing them into a pop star. I was never a part of that. I’m shy, you know. I wouldn’t have been good at the interviews.” She is also nothing like malleable enough for a process such as that, with a fierce sense of self that she puts down to the best years of her life.Florence Pugh said: ‘It’s amazing to see women’s bodies doing something that’s sensual, but not oversexualised’When were they? “I guess between five and about eight?” Seriously? “My mum was a salsa dancer and she made costumes as well. We didn’t have a lavish lifestyle, but I was really loved. Especially as a young child, in those formative years, my mum had a lot of curiosity in me – discovering who I was and what made me tick. She put a lot of time into that, a lot of attention to detail. It was so magical. Everything was possible, every single day. I wasn’t a princessy kid – I was quite gender neutral – but I was always dancing, figuring out how I could use my body to become a cat, or to say an idea. I grew up feeling like my body could do anything.”Her early dance training had its limits – ballet, modern, tap. “It was pre-internet and I was from Cheltenham,” she says, laughing. “As I’ve got older, I’ve understood that movement is such a deep well of inspiration.”In the same way that she could never have been moulded into the mainstream of the 2010s, neither does she fit into this “TikTok era, with kids having one song that will blow up overnight. I’ve not been a part of that, either.” She has a deep suspicion of new media’s impact on creativity: “Everyone has a voice. There’s more opinions and fans can make you or break you. They can decide overnight that you’re this and that; they can comment, they can make videos that give the wrong impression and spread through the whole internet like wildfire.”When she was in a relationship with the actor Robert Pattinson, in the mid-2010s, she got a load of abusive drivel from his fans, but by her own account her fans are sophisticated people, or they wouldn’t like her in the first place. Does she get a lot of flak? “No, I don’t,” she says. “This doesn’t bother me personally. I think it just makes it hard for genuine artists to stay original.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s hard for genuine artists to stay original’ … at the Palace theatre in Los Angeles in 2019.Photograph: Rich Fury/Getty Images for ABAYou could call FKA twigs’ a portfolio career – singing, dancing, acting, modelling – but she is usually doing all those things simultaneously. If she were a man, I think she would be called a performance artist. “When I did the Valentino show [at Paris fashion week in 2023], Florence Pugh said: ‘It’s amazing to see women’s bodies doing something that’s sensual, but not oversexualised.’ Which isn’t to say that I don’t use my body in a way that’s sexualised sometimes – that is a part of my language – but there’s a whole other spectrum, as a woman, to move in a way that’s dynamic, strong, sensual, awe‑inspiring, but not supposed to be serving. Unless that’s my choice. There’s a pole dance I do in my new show which is both. I decide when I’m serving and I decide when I’m not.”Ah, the pole dancing. This was a feminist faultline in the 90s, when FKA twigs was just a small child. We were all arguing about the pornification of the mainstream and whether it could ever be ironic enough to get away with it. In the video for Cellophane, the standout single from her 2019 album, Magdalene, she answers that question definitively, without really trying. There is some incredible choreography, with haunting, creepy special effects, in which, yes, she is pole dancing, but, no, she is definitely not serving. Commandingly acrobatic, it is a show of strength with a trace of menace. “With the pole, it’s about finding new ways to play with the ideas your body can say. Sex work is the oldest profession; why are we so outraged by it?”View image in fullscreen‘Now, fans can make you or break you’ … at Flow festival in Helsinki in 2016.Photograph: Gaëlle Beri/RedfernsAt the start of last year, this tension – surely you can reclaim and express the sexuality of your own body without having to internalise the objectification projected on to it? – blew up in the hands of theAdvertising Standards Authority, which banned a Calvin Klein advertfor an “overly sexualised” image that focused on FKA twigs’ body rather than the clothes being advertised, but then lifted the ban two months later, after she said she was proud of the image and had collaborated in its creation. It seems obvious, from any given image, that whatever FKA twigs’ body is saying about sex, or anything else, she is the one who is saying it. But not obvious enough, apparently.When she plays the song Cellophane live, fans on social media always wonder afterwards whether she is OK. It’s the lyrics, partly – “Didn’t I do it for you? / Why don’t I do it for you? / Why won’t you do it for me? / When all I do is for you?” – but it is mainly the eerily convincing embodiment of anguish. “I’m a performer!” she says, indignantly. “I think it would be more sad to be on stage and smiling. When you’re out there shaking the tail feather and not feeling it, that’s when it hurts. Not when you’re crying.”The day after our interview, she gave the keynote speech at the Audio and Visual Arts festival at the British Library and distilled this vibe – that she has been in this game a long time, is pushing 40 (her words), is competent in ways that belie the unearthly creature you see: “I know where my keys are.” Keys like keys, or keys like music? Can get back into her house, or knows what’s what? Her meaning is ambiguous, a lot of the time, but only to liven things up; it never seems to connote uncertainty on her part.FKA twigs: Eusexua review – a hymn to the healing power of the dancefloorRead moreThere is a song on Eusexua the lyrics of which fans will be poring over. She started writing Keep It, Hold It four years ago, when it was about “keeping abuse a secret – don’t tell anybody anything”. That would have been 2021, when she detailed in an interview with Elle what she described as an abusive relationship with the actorShia LaBeouf. (LaBeouf denies the claims.) It is a chilling, sad and enraging account of a relationship that began in 2018, on the set of his semi-autobiographical film Honey Boy, in which she played Shy Girl, and ended the following year. In retrospect, even the fact that he would conjure himself a fictional girl and not give her a name gives me the creeps.Just before that interview with Elle, FKA twigsfiled a lawsuit against LaBeouffor sexual battery, assault and the infliction of emotional distress, which she can’t now talk about, as the hearing is this year. I almost don’t want to mention it, because it seems so wrong for her openness to carry such a heavy price, for LaBeouf’s name to be for ever mentioned in conjunction with hers. Yet her courage in describing that publicly is a fundamental part of who she is, as is the fact that she is still, while keeping her terms very general, radically honest about what happened and what came after.Whatever that song meant originally, the lyrics have evolved, she says: “Four years on, it means something completely different. Now, ‘keep it and hold it’ means look after yourself. That light you hold as a human, always protect it. For me, I’m very ferocious. I used to think: no one will ever blow the candle out. And I still believe that, but it can get dimmed. So now it’s about: no, I’ll always protect my candle.”While she was doing her keynote at the British Library, in conversation with the DJ and club legend Nadine Noor, she described her experience with the media in a way that was a little chastening. She would show up to a conversation because it was one of her “deliverables”; journalists would ask her how she was, but not really care about the answer, as that was just one of their “deliverables”. “I’m in a place of brutal honesty at the moment,” she said to the audience. “In a gentle and caring way. I don’t have anything to hide.” People cheered, although it wasn’t the end. In an FKA twigs performance, you may never understand exactly what you are hearing or looking at, but you know it’s real.FKA twigs’ new album, Eusexua, is out now on YoungDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Last time, Statham fought back against phone scammers and a conspiracy that led all the way to, well, you know; this time, he’s taking on sex trafficking. He’s narrowed his focus, though: There’s one particular act of sex trafficking that really gets his goat. The bad guys have the ill fortune to target Jenny Garcia (Arianna Rivas), the college-aged daughter of Joe (Michael Peña), owner of the construction outfit where Levon Cade (Statham) makes his no-fuss living. Levon is saving up for a lawyer to fight for better custody of his own young daughter, so when Jenny is kidnapped from a bar outing, he reluctantly agrees to dust off the Royal Marine skills that never really went anywhere and track her down. (Joe also offers him a huge sum of cash, a potential boon for his custody battle with his dead wife’s supercilious father.)The movie’s steady supply of working-class posturing is a bit much, even for the genuinely and charmingly rough-hewn Statham. Some of the muchness presumably comes courtesy ofSylvester Stallone, who shares screenwriting credit with Ayer. The result is an unexpected three-way tug of war, gentle but unmistakable, between their three compatible yet distinct sensibilities. There are glimmers of classic Statham action scenes, as when thugs harass employees at a Garcia worksite and Levon takes matters (as well as a bunch of constructional materials) into his own hands. There’s crusty Stallone-style camaraderie in Levon’s friendship with his blind compatriot Gunny (David Harbour, hammy as ever) and his instant chemistry with a tangentially involved gang leader. Two more of the over-many bad guys, meanwhile, feel like they’re wandering in from a bad Ayer remake of The Crow. The movie shifts visual tones and textures from scene to scene, sometimes digital-clear and sometimes 2000s-style grainy, which is both novel and more than a little jarring.Where Stallone and Ayer seem to agree is that Statham torturing and mowing down bad guys is as exciting as him fighting a bunch of henchmen (untrue!) and Jenny especially doesn’t deserve to be sex-trafficked because she’s so tough and self-reliant. (In fact, she often seems more annoyed than truly afraid for her life.) The movie also indulges some weird intimations that Joe, while obviously fitting the “model minority” stereotype to a T, is too soft and weak to truly protect his family, and must outsource the job to unpretentious working-class Levon, who lives a spartan life in his truck before he acquiesces to the lawyer-suggested need for a residence and upgrades to a flophouse. Joe may technically be a widower, but the movie’s divorce-dad energy is off the charts.At its best, a movie like A Working Man functions as an update to the hard-boiled detective story, with a resilient bruiser conducting his own off-books missing-person investigation. There’s a little of that juice as Levon does some amateur undercover work as a drug buyer, cozying up to a motorcycle gang (the aforementioned leader sits on a chrome throne, another touch that feels like Ayer’s doing). But Stallone and Ayer don’t have the patience for too much skullduggery; skullsmashery is more their thing, and as an action movie, A Working Man doesn’t reach the giddy highs of Statham’s best. It spends too much time futzing with its star’s righteous bona fides, and while Statham looks great for his age, his fight sequences become increasingly methodical as the movie goes on, making little use of his trademark athleticism. Some of the movie’s cartoon mayhem is fun enough. The rest feels like, well, work.A Working Man is out in US and UK cinemas on 28 MarchExplore more on these topicsJason StathamSylvester StallonereviewsShareReuse this content"

It also stars Frances Fisher and Travis Fimmel.It is described as “a heartfelt and emotional story forged in the struggles of the new frontier”.Baldwin was charged with manslaughter after a prop gun killed Hutchins and injured the film’s writer-director Joel Souza. The case was dismissed last July for Baldwin but the armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed is serving an 18-month sentence for her role.The film was later completed andpremieredlast November at the Camerimage cinematography festival in Torun, Poland. It is dedicated to Hutchins.“We are here because we want to honour her,” Souza said at the premiere. “We want to showcase her work. We want it not to just disappear.”Vulture’s Nick Newmancalledit “a work of salutary effect and simple pleasure saturated in morbid curiosity”.Earlier this month a documentary was released on Hulu calledLast Take: Rust and the Story of Halynawhich looked back at both Hutchins and the accident. “She absolutely would have become a household name as a cinematographer,” the film’s director, Rachel Mason, said to the Guardian. “Anyone who knew her had absolutely no doubt she was going to be on the highest level, winning awards, becoming well-known for that.”The film drew some criticism upon premiering for its focus on the death of Hutchins over her life and career. “I hoped it might have a little more Halyna in it or been a little more about Halyna,” Souza said.Mason told the Guardian that the shift was inevitable with each new development. “As we were working on the film, the story kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger,” she said. “There was more news, there were trials, and there were things that I couldn’t have imagined when I first started. I just wanted to focus entirely on Halyna and her body of work, the people that she knew and she worked with, and not so much on Rust.”Baldwin has since led a reality show on TLC that follows the life of himself and his family. The Guardian’s Lucy Mangancalledit “a new low for television”.The actor will next star in the Italian Christmas movie Kid Santa alongside his brother William. The film comes from the director of Sherlock Santa, Vote for Santa and The Good Witch of Christmas.Rust will be released on 2 May in the US.Explore more on these topicsAlec BaldwinRust film set shootingWesternsnewsShareReuse this content"

He recalls his shaky start as a standup and what he learned from Bob Monkhouse and Les DawsonJohnny BallWed 26 Mar 2025 07.01 EDTShareAfter spending the summer as a Redcoat, I arrived at Butlin’s Metropole hotel in Blackpool. As I walked in, the entertainments manager asked, without hesitation, “Can you do an act?” “No,” I said. “Shit,” he said, and the tale unravelled. The summer Reds had gone and we were starting up the winter season. But the hotel had no lull between summer and winter. There were guests who needed entertaining, but with whom? Principal comedian Freddie Davies was on honeymoon and a second comic hadn’t yet arrived. “Are you sure you don’t do an act?” asked Vince in desperation. “Well, I do know an act!” I said. “Great,” said Vince, “you’re doing it tonight.”For the past two seasons, playing drums for the Redcoat Show, I had watched Ricky McCabe’s very funny, never-changing comedy spot around 60 times. Of course, I knew every word. It opened with, “Hello there. Will the lady with the lucky ticket come up and get me?” So, that very Friday night, having no option, being the only person available, I was top of the bill. I was very nervous, but once the first few gags had got laughs, I relaxed, and it went quite well. “Fabulous,” said Vince, “same again tomorrow night!” I pleaded no, but, of course, the guests changed over on Saturday so I would have a totally new audience. This time, with more confidence, it went very well indeed. Right after the show, one of the girls came up and said, “Great spot, Johnny. Oh, the new Redcoat has just arrived – he says he knows you. His name is Ricky McCabe!”View image in fullscreen‘First dream achieved. I’m a Butlin’s Redcoat!’Photograph: Courtesy: Johnny BallI was rooted to the spot in shock. But, plucking up courage, I rushed into the lounge to find Ricky. “Hello, mate,” he cried, grinning from ear to ear. With no sign of a smile, I guided him to a table and said, “Ricky, I’ve got to tell you something terrible. I’ve just done your act.” The smile drained from his face! I quickly explained that I hadn’t volunteered to do it. They had nobody else, and I had admitted that I knew his act, having watched it so often from my drums. Ricky went through the act, and I confirmed, “Yes, I did that. Yep, that too.” I had missed nothing. Ricky was in complete shock. After a few “bloody hells!” or similar, he resigned himself to the situation and started to work out what he would do for an act the next night, with me trying to help. In a couple of days, Ricky had forgiven me.As a team, we all became great friends at the Metropole and Ricky helped me write my very first comedy act. I had been collecting gags by the hundred since I was 11, but jokes in a book do not make an act. It was Ricky and his experience which solved this problem. As a comedian, you have to explain in the first instant just what kind of person you are. I was incredibly nervous and unsure of myself, so that had to be the tack.Ricky suggested I carry a brown paper bag, slightly inflated, and arrive on stage visibly shaking. At the microphone, I would say, “Hello. I’d like to start by, er, start. I’d like to commence. First of all, I’d like to say, to start, er, first of all!” Then I would stop and point at the quivering bag and say, “Bag of nerves!” It always got the laugh and often applause and I would throw the bag into the wings and come back smiling. The ice was broken and away I went. I soon became known as “Bag of Nerves”!I was giving the audience what they were asking for – and only ever as rude as they wanted me to beSlowly, I learned the tricks of keeping the audience on side and building a rapport with them. This change of fortune arrived when I learned to relax and appeared to be enjoying the audience’s company from the first minute. My style became one of almost asking the audience for their approval before I could carry on. I would soon slip in a slightly bluer joke and immediately ask for their approval. So, rather like Max Miller, I was apparently giving the audience what they were asking for and only ever as rude as they wanted me to be.Bob Monkhouse first saw me working a big rough club in Manchester. He arrived looking very out of place in his dress suit with tissues tucked around his neck to stop the makeup reaching his Persil-white collar. He caught me as I came offstage and complimented me on my timing and the fresh new style I was developing. Bob was the greatest comedy technician I would ever see – the consummate master. From Bob, I learned that when you are coming to a major punchline, you make sure you are moving towards the audience on the tag, or lighting up your face, or changing it to a frown – anything with a dynamic impact. This learning process wasn’t about stealing – it was about learning the many ways that a performance can be improved and adapted.View image in fullscreen‘First picture as a comedian – a cigarette was part of the act.’Photograph: Courtesy: Johnny BallIn late 1964 (still my first year as a professional), the agent Mike Hughes called his four principal comedians to Liverpool for a photocall. He had marketed us as the Liverpool Comedy Wave and it worked, even though only one of us hailed from Merseyside. Besides myself, there was my old Butlin’s mate Freddie Davies, Mike Burton and Mike Newman. All three had appeared on Opportunity Knocks, but I refused to even consider it. Everything about it smacked of amateurism. I remember one of them appeared on the show sandwiched between three schoolgirls singing Three Little Maids and a taxi driver from Walthamstow who played “the mouth organ”. Of course, the show did make stars of Freddie Davies and dear oldLes Dawson, who I knew well.Les was a comedian’s comedian, and we all loved his material despite the fact that it didn’t get many laughs. His flowery vocabulary was very entertaining to us, but club audiences weren’t that enamoured with his total lack of energy. What club audiences wanted was vitality. What Les gave them was lugubriousness. He was a droll and his style suggested a lack of care for everything, including his own act. On two occasions, I recall talking Les into carrying on in the business. But I honestly didn’t think he would carry on much longer. Then came Opportunity Knocks and his static comic style made him an instant star.Meanwhile, I was in such demand in the clubs I still had every confidence that I would get a major break very soon. The Stage newspaper’s respected James Towler, in his Yorkshire Relish column, featured the four Mike Hughes comedians, ending with, “But the one with most potential is most certainly Johnny Ball!” Only time would tell.This is an edited extract from Johnny Ball – My Previous Life in Comedy, published by the Book Guild (£10.99).

The fundamentals of this scene are familiar – you’ve probably watched something like it in a film, or dreamed about it happening to you; perhaps it already has. But Sara lives in a new world, several decades in the future, and she is being arrested because Scout, the state’s AI security system, has flagged something irregular inside her mind.Sara seems unexceptional: she’s a museum archivist, married and mother to young twins. She once had an argument with her husband Elias after he impulsively part-exchanged the family Toyota for a Volvo. Sara sees herself as a person who “couldn’t possibly be considered a member of the lawbreaking classes”, until the moment at the airport when an officer informs her that her “risk score” is too high, and sends her to Madison, a California women’s retention centre housed in a former elementary school. At Madison, a record of good behaviour will lower her score; however, this record lies in the hands of her guards. She is not sufficiently subordinate, and can’t get her number down.“Retainees” are held initially for 21 days, then on a rolling basis, potentially for ever. This isn’t punishment but risk management, for anybody considered likely to commit a crime. Every citizen has a risk score, extrapolated via algorithm from personal cloud data, from surveillance networks, and from the Dreamsaver – a widely used skull implant that delivers more restful sleep. The small print of Dreamsaver Inc grants the company rights to share the user’s dreams with the government. People are OK with this; it seems to have reduced terrorism.The Dream Hotel has a burning quality, both in its swift, consuming escalation and in the clarity and purpose of what it showsThe Dream Hotel is Laila Lalami’s fifth novel – earlier works received nominations for the Booker, Pulitzer and National book awards – and has been longlisted for the Women’s prize. Her 2020 nonfiction book, Conditional Citizens, draws on her experiences as a Moroccan American to think about her adopted country’s two-tier system: how rights and freedoms are, in practice, exercised very differently across race, class, gender and national origin. Lalami’s fiction has explored the way these differences play out across a range of times and places: from Hope and Other Dangerous Pursuits (2005), on migrant experiences in modern Morocco, toThe Moor’s Account(2014), inspired by the true story of a 16th-century Black man who survived a notorious Spanish colonial expedition to the Americas. Her most recent novel, 2019’sThe Other Americans, is set in California in the shadow of the Iraq war, and follows the causes and repercussions of the moment when Driss, a Moroccan immigrant, is killed at an intersection by a speeding car.In The Dream Hotel, Lalami turns to the future. The novel is especially interesting as a vision of how AI could weave itself into the two-tier system that she has described and reimagined in earlier works. Sara contrasts the apparent neutrality of Scout’s “new era of digital policing” with the racist treatment her Moroccan immigrant parents received at US airports during her childhood. However, familiar prejudices are built into new tools, which search for specific deviations from an enforced norm. Some bad arguments and weird dreams, a relative who has been in prison and a history of drug use are enough for conviction. Sara’s medical notes link to a record documenting that she was the victim of a sexual assault when she was 19. This adds three points to her risk score.Reading The Dream Hotel is a physical experience: it’s rare for a novel to induce so strong a sense of powerlessness and frustration. Like many technologies, Lalami’s AI renders its users, from the individual to the state, simultaneously smarter and more stupid. It harvests vast quantities of data, then fundamentally misunderstands it. Meanwhile retainees’ hearings are randomly deferred; visits denied; phone calls cut off and overcharged; privacies invaded. “Prison is a place beyond shame.” Sara gradually absorbs the reality that she has become one of the people the state can punish. She dispatches emails of complaint to an interface whose blank replies denote impunity: “We are working to resolve service disruptions”; “This ticket is marked as resolved.”In this sharp, sophisticated novel of forecasts and insightful takes, what I found most powerful was the great bewilderment that the characters share. Lalami traces the upheaval of AI through systems and structures into personal lives, close relationships and quiet thoughts. Sara privately questions whether she has a hidden potential for violence. An interlude at the centre of the novel follows a tech executive who is straining to make sense of her vast yet miserable power.Perhaps you wouldn’t ordinarily pick up a novel in search of an experience of confusion. But The Dream Hotel has a burning quality, both in its swift, consuming escalation – you can’t look away – and in the clarity and purpose of what it shows. Sara is drawn into the bizarre logic through which imprisonment and a two-tier system make one another make sense. “She must’ve done something,” says one new retainee of a longtime resident. “I mean, if they’rekeepingher here this long, then they must have something on her.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I’ve tested everything from heated blankets to high chairs, and all my reviews are firm but fair.I’m a self-confessed anthophile, and this isn’t my first time testing flower delivery services. Of course, I love luxury flowers as much as the next person – I have a soft spot for a fussy arrangement or silk ribbon – but I also have a lot of time for budget flowers. In spring, I rarely go past a bucket of £1 supermarket daffodils without picking up a bunch. Whatever your budget, I’m determined to hunt down the best bouquet for your buck.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I needed to invest in several new vases.’Photograph: Zoë PhillimoreDuring testing, I received many bunches from the main British flower-delivery services. I first tested for Valentine’s Day and then tested again for Mother’s Day. In fact, I received 23 arrangements over the two testing periods. My regular courier drivers asked if everything was OK, as they were delivering enough flowers tosatisfy even Elton John’s needs. The flowers were counted and cut on arrival to condition them, and then arranged into vases and placed around my house. I followed the directions for each bunch where relevant – arranging them and adding flower food as suggested.I kept my eye on each bouquet every day, noting when any flowers began to fade. My house is a draughty Victorian number, but I did fire up the central heating and log burner intermittently to see how the flowers coped. I had all the flowers delivered over the course of two days so I could be sure they all underwent the same conditions (yes, I did need to invest in several new vases – charity shops are great hunting grounds for them).The best flower delivery services in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Iaroslava Zolotko/Getty Images/iStockphotoBest overall:Marks & SpencerView image in fullscreen£40 at M&SBouquet tested:white rose, antirrhinum and eucalyptusMarks & Spencer has recently overhauled its flower business, offering a five-day freshness guarantee on its bouquets. For Valentine’s Day, I tested an impressive, much larger (and much more expensive) arrangement, but for Mother’s Day, I’ve opted for something a bit more modest that’s available for next-day delivery.Why we love itThe arrangement I tested was incredibly fresh. The one recommended here features 21 stems of pink antirrhinum, white rose and eucalyptus populus. The pretty and delicate antirrhinum are the real spectacle here – they will come in bud, and open over a few days, revealing their delicate pastel pinks. The quality of the white roses I received in my bunch was incredible – large and juicy. I often find that roses in arrangements are small and slightly dull, but not here. I love the scent and drama of eucalyptus – a superior bit of foliage in my opinion.M&S says it sources as many British flowers as it can, depending on what’s in season. It also uses sustainable packaging. The flowers I tested came in a cardboard box and the bouquet was wrapped in kraft paper with a form of cellophane wrap over the top.It’s a shame that…there aren’t guaranteed to be more British flowers in the arrangements.Fastest delivery:next dayDelivery cost:FreeB Corp certified:noBest budget:Scilly FlowersView image in fullscreen£28.50 at Scilly FlowersBouquet tested:60 scented narcissiSpring sunshine in a box, this affordable delivery overflows with 60 beautiful budded narcissus stems, some vibrant egg-yolk yellow, some pastel.

They’re low-effort, maximum joy in flower form. You don’t need any special skills to arrange them because they’re so gloriously simple. Many of the stems came as buds, and gradually opened up over the week, which spread the joy for longer.It’s a shame that…they sell out so fast (I tested a beautiful Mother’s Day bouquet as well that sadly went out of stock) and aren’t available all year round but this is understandable on both counts.Fastest delivery: 1st class Royal MailDelivery cost:freeB Corp certified:noBestsubscription service:Freddie’s FlowersView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Zoë Phillimore£41 at Freddie’s FlowersBouquet tested:showstopper (seasonal arrangements change on four-weekly cycles)Freddie’s Flowers started as a subscription-only business, but it has since grown to offer one-off deliveries too. I’ve tested both, with the latest beingPaint the World, a seasonal Mother’s Day arrangement from its one-off gifting range. The flowers arrived in a flat-lay box, bundled in recyclable paper along with instructions on how to create your arrangement.Why we love itI love taking the time to arrange the blooms. It’s a chance to get creative, even if only for five minutes. And it’s simple enough to follow the instructions, even if you’re not particularly artistic.I loved the variety of blooms, too: it was clear that thought had gone into creating something dramatic, with even the filler flowers adding dimension and spectacle. The lilies in Paint the World came carefully packaged in extra padding, and all the flowers were of great quality.Lilies aren’t ideal for everyone, though, as they’re extremely poisonous to pets; the subscription boxes can be made lily-free for that very reason (although you still need to be cautious around other kinds of flowers, as noted at the top of the article).It’s a shame that…you don’t have much control over your delivery days, and although good value, the one-off arrangement didn’t have as many stems as the showstopper bunch.Fastest delivery: subscription flowers are variable – delivery days are set depending on your postcode;one-off bunchesare available next dayDelivery cost:for subscription flowers, £4; for one-off deliveries, next day £5, standard freeB Corp certified:yesBest same-day flowers:InterfloraView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Zoë PhillimoreFrom £75 at InterfloraBouquet tested:Love & Joy to MumInterflora is effectively a floral matchmaker.

For testing, I received a peachy bouquet called Love & Joy to Mum, which was teeming with roses, gerberas, tulips and eucalyptus.Why we love itI love the more personal feeling of receiving a bouquet from a local florist – especially because, as luck would have it, mine came from my favourite florist. Interflora guarantees that arrangements are made to order, and my arrangement certainly seemed fresh. Some of the flowers were lightly scented but not overpowering, which is always a joy.The bouquet easily lasted beyond five days, providing a burst of colour and delight on my dining table long after the initial excitement of receiving them. For the last-minute ones among us, you’ll be glad to know that Interflora offers same-day delivery if you order before 3pm. There’s sometimes surge pricing on very busy delivery days, though(which I imagine includes Mother’s Day).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

They come bundled up “sleeping” – so most flowers are in bud rather than big blousy blooms. But this just means they unfurl over time, last longer and bring extended joy as you watch them blossom. I’ve tested various letterbox flower delivery services and rate Bloom & Wild as the best – for range, service and quality. It always offers new trend-led arrangements, too.Why we love itI opted for the Hope bouquet, which gives £1 of each sale to Tommy’s, a charity that funds research into the causes of miscarriage, stillbirth and premature birth. I can’t think of a more perfect Mother’s Day gift than to pay it forward for mums who have been through any of these experiences.This bouquet has spring tulips with the bulb still attached. Once the flowers die back, dry the bulbs, pop them in the paper bag included and then plant them out in a flower bed or planter (in late October to December) for them to bloom again next Mother’s Day. Delicate irises and dramatic snapdragons complete the bouquet. There are no instructions on how to arrange these flowers, but I still had a lot of fun shuffling them about in the vase.It’s a shame that…there weren’t one or two more stems or more iris in the arrangement. It felt like there was a bit too much filler.Fastest delivery:next dayDelivery cost:free, but up to £6 for weekend deliveryB Corp certified:yesThe best of the restView image in fullscreenSmith & MunsonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Zoë Phillimore£35 at Smith & MunsonBest for:British-grown single-variety flowersBouquet tested:columbus double British tulips, 20 stemsSmith & Munson grows all its flowers in Lincolnshire – it specialises in tulips, like the sample I tried, lilies, peonies and ranunculus. These are all seasonal, so you can’t get them out of season.They were all buds when they arrived, ensuring they lasted as long as possible. I liked that they were packaged in a tube, with instructions to pop them in water and keep them in the paper for a few hours. Presumably, this is to let them acclimatise to being indoors – but it also extends the anticipation as you can’t see your flowers for a few hours. After six hours, the buds opened to reveal puffy double tulips in bright pink hues. Smith & Munson is dedicated to growing quality flowers in the UK, and having a single-variety bouquet meant every stem was a winner.It didn’t make the final cut because …the flowers didn’t last quite as long as I’d have liked (about five days).Fastest delivery:24 hours (Tuesday-Saturday);delivery cost:free;B Corp certified:noFlowerbxView image in fullscreenFrom £45 at FlowerbxBest for:show-stopping flowersBouquet tested:blush nude stocks, 20 stemsFlowerbx is another delivery service that offers single-variety bunches, but you’ll only be able to get these ones in time for Mother’s Day if you live in London. These blush nude stocks are perfect for Mother’s Day, with a choice of between 10 and 40 stems. Stocks are a highly scented spring flower that will fill your recipient’s home with a gorgeous fragrance while looking absolutely show-stopping. I’ve tested Flowerbx on two different occasions and the brand always provides the arrangement that people remark on the most – no stem has been a dud, and they last incredibly well.It didn’t make the final cut because …the delivery turnaround times can be fairly long for £5.Fastest delivery:same day in London, variable nationwide;delivery cost:from £5;B Corp certified:yesWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: yacobchuk/Getty ImagesSustainabilityCut flowers don’t have a great reputation in the sustainability stakes, but many brands are working hard to improve practices. Look for British-grown flowers where you can, and go for those that are seasonal. Peonies in January are just not a good vibe for the planet.Delivery timesNot all flower-delivery services offer next-day delivery. Check the delivery service offering on the website or underneath each entry above. And some can sneak in the cost on top of the flowers, which ends up making a fairly affordable bunch rather punchy.How to make your flowers last longer at homeCut flowers may last only five days at home, even with all the variables being in their favour. Roses and tulips especially don’t last long. However, other flowers such as hydrangeas and chrysanthemums can go for a lot longer.To make your flowers last longer at home, you’ve got to think about care and the environment. Only ever use a clean vase, then trim off a few centimetres from the end of each stem. Cut them at a 45-degree angle to increase the surface area in the water. Remove any foliage on the stem below the water line, and then put them in cool water, mixed with flower food (all decent flowers should come with flower food).12 affordable jewellery brands, worn and rated for style and qualityRead morePick the right spot for your flowers. Spring flowers don’t appreciate being near heat sources. Don’t put them too close to your fruit bowl, either: fruit releases ethylene gas, which makes your flowers wilt more quickly.Tips for buying seasonal flowersAs well as being more sustainable, seasonal flowers will last longer in your home. Knowing what’s in season is the best place to start. If you’re buying flowers in the depths of winter, this means no sunflowers or dahlias are coming your way.Buy your flowers from a local florist, or via an online flower delivery service that says it offers British seasonal flowers. It may take a deep dive to find out what that actually looks like. Flower subscriptions, such as Freddie’s Flowers above, are also a great way to get seasonal flowers that have been grown to order.Zoë Phillimore is a freelance journalistwith 20 years of experience.She’s tested everything from mattresses to makeup, and she’s slightly obsessed with finding small new businesses to spotlight.

I saw her visibly shrink. So I taught her the value of bad mannersAmy BeashelWed 26 Mar 2025 02.55 EDTShareMy daughter is beautiful. At least, I’ve always thought so and, like many mothers of babies and toddlers, I enjoyed the recognition of her gorgeousness from others. “Isn’t she cute?” “Her eyes are so pretty!” “Wow, what lovely thick hair!”There are, of course, many other wonderful things about my youngest – her voracious appetite for books and wicked comic timing for a start – but, as she morphed from baby to toddler to young lady, I noticed how strangers commented on her looks much more than they did with my son.To my surprise, I found that I was doing the same thing. My daughter and I loved choosing outfits together and learning how to style hair in buns and braids, whereas – the occasional demand for a mullet notwithstanding – my son showed far less interest in his appearance.I assuaged my guilt over whether I was reinforcing stereotypes with the truth that there is creativity in outward expression, and made sure to remind my child that there are more important things than looks.Then came the party. My daughter was no longer a little girl but an 11-year-old. Sparkling in a midnight-blue jumpsuit, she was excited about dancing and cake. Together, we mingled with family, friends and strangers. A man in his 70s approached us: a kind-faced, jolly type who was delighted with the surprisingly good weather and his gin. Then, without prompting, he ran his eyes the length of my daughter.“You’re a very attractive young lady, aren’t you?”Technically, his question was merely a variation on the compliments we had exchanged with other women and girls at the party just minutes before. But I felt the mood shift.My daughter’s smile became awkward. Suddenly everything about her – her dipped head, her flushed cheeks, her shoulders, which curled a fraction to make her seem ever so slightly smaller – conveyed a sense of embarrassment and shame.The man who “complimented” my 11-year-old displayed no similar signs of discomfort. In his eyes, I imagine he had done nothing wrong. But, witnessing my daughter’s obvious unease, I was angry. Could he not see he had made her feel self-conscious? Did he really believe that voicing his opinion on a child’s appearance was acceptable? I asked him neither of these questions of course, silenced by good manners. I didn’t want to makehimfeel awkward. I was afraid to make a scene.It was only later that I apologised to my daughter. I had prioritised a stranger’s comfort over her own and potentially taught her to do the same. My mum and I have long joked about how, when I was a student, I worked the phrase “discovering her own self-worth” into every English literature essay I submitted, from GCSE to degree-level. But, apparently, it was something I struggled to put into practice. In that moment, my response felt like a feminist fail.Only it wasn’t. My daughter and I have often spoken about that afternoon, with my son and husband in on the conversation, too. I’ve shared many of my own uncomfortable experiences, from the man who shouted at me “look at the tits on her” when I was 12, to the cafe manager who touched my bum while I worked as a waitress, when I was 15. After the latter, I snuck off in tears to call my mum, who whisked me away, concocting a forgotten appointment as an excuse for my sudden departure. Neither of us challenged the manager about what he had done.I tell my children these stories to place my daughter’s experience at the party into cultural and generational context. For so long, society has encouraged women and girls to be accommodating of men, while simultaneously normalising the sexism, objectification and violence they so often experience at their hands. As a result, many of us still find it difficult to articulate our unease. That incident prompted my daughter and I to discuss alternative responses to comments or requests that leave us feeling uneasy: “I’m not comfortable with what you said”, or “I don’t find that funny”, or “No”.I still find that last one the hardest. Its monosyllabic brevity feels rude – but I’d rather the discomfort that comes from saying “no” than the horror of what can come from saying nothing.I continue to teach my daughter not to smile or say thank you in the face of unwanted compliments. And if she is perceived as bad mannered, I’m OK with that. Men’s egos are no longer the priority. And what is?

The stress and guilt of our split caused me to experience erectile dysfunction. I consulted a doctor and was prescribedViagra.The day after getting the meds I had very good sex with my girlfriend, but after about a month I decided totry without the tablet and failed miserably.So Iwent back to takinga tablet every timeI have sex. I getthem online nowso I don’t evenspeak to a consultant. Itake half a pill 20 minutesbefore sex, without telling my partner; however, I get stressed atthe thought of it not workingand sometimes getheart palpitations. I wonder if I should go back to the doctor and get an implant or another form ofmedication.My lover thinks I am a virile manand would be shocked if she knew I took the blue pill.The heart palpitations you are describing may be of concern, so please arrange an in-person consultation with a doctor immediately. Other than that, your health is your private business. If it does not affect another person you do not need to share your medical facts – or your medication protocol – with anyone else. One of the useful things about ED meds is that they can reduce erectile anxiety – but this doesn’t seem to be working in your case. And you are doing your best to “perform” well but that stressful focus is not necessarily the most productive path to sexual pleasure, satisfaction and true intimacy. Pause and think about what genuinely gives you pleasure; I bet it is not only about erectile perfection.

Follow these nine simple steps to create crumbly delights that you’ll make again and againFelicity CloakeWed 26 Mar 2025 08.00 EDTShareOatcakes are that glorious thing: portable porridge – a high-fibre, high-energy, pocket-friendly snack that’s almost as good on its own as it is on a cheeseboard with a wedge of Hebridean blue. Commercial versions, however (which often contain some very un-Scottish palm oil), can be so sturdy that they could double as chipboard, but once you taste these crumbly, richly flavoured, homemade alternatives, you’ll never go back.Prep10 minCook40 minMakesAbout 14200g medium oatmeal50g pinhead oatmeal25g porridge oats75g butter¼ tsp salt¼ tsp brown sugar2 tbsp fine oatmeal, or plain flour of your choice (gluten-free is fine), plus extra for dusting1 Toast the oatmeal and oatsView image in fullscreenHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Line a large, preferably rimmed baking tray with baking paper and tip in the medium and pinhead oatmeals and the porridge oats. Spread out and bake for about 15 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally to ensure they brown evenly; you should be able to smell them toasting even with the door closed.View image in fullscreen2 A note on the butterView image in fullscreenMeanwhile, put the kettle on for the boiling water in the next step. Dice the butter and put it in a heatproof jug – if you’d prefer to keep your oatcakes vegan, you should be able to substitute most brands of plant butter or coconut oil (though the latter will give them a distinctly tropical flavour).3 Flavour the toasted oatmealView image in fullscreenLeaving the oven on, use the baking paper in the tray to funnel the toasted oats into a large heatproof bowl. Stir in the salt and sugar – both are optional, but recommended, though you may well wish to adjust the amounts of each to taste, or indeed to add another flavouring such as dried seaweed flakes, black pepper, chilli, finely grated hard cheese, seeds or sweet spices (ginger or cinnamon, say).4 Make the oatcake doughView image in fullscreenPour 75ml boiling water on to the butter, leave to sit briefly, then stir until melted. If you’d like to add a liquid flavouring such as Marmite or honey, add this now, then mix the lot into the toasted oats, along with the fine oatmeal or flour to make a damp but coherent dough; if it’s too wet, add a little more flour.5 Prepare the baking kitLightly grease the same sheet of baking paper that you used to toast the oats; depending on the size of the tray, you may need a second sheet and a second tray. Alternatively, bake the oatcakes in two batches, keeping the cut-out, uncooked biscuits in the fridge for up to a couple of days (or freeze them and bake from frozen, though if you do that, they’ll take longer to cook).6 Flatten and shapeView image in fullscreenDust a work surface with fine oatmeal or flour, then use your hands or a rolling pin to pat out the dough until it’s about 5mm thick (if you prefer your oatcakes thinner and crisper, by all means go for it). Use a cutter or glass of your desired size (I use a 5cm one) to cut out the oatcakes, re-rolling any scraps and cutting out more oatcakes.7 Bake for 20 minutesView image in fullscreenArrange the oatcakes on the lined baking tray (s), bearing in mind that, if you’re short on space, they don’t really spread during baking, so can be positioned quite close together. Put in the oven and bake for 20 minutes, turning the tray around after 10 minutes to ensure they cook evenly.8 Flip and finish bakingUsing a palette knife or spatula, carefully flip over each oatcake, then bake for a further five to 10 minutes, depending on how crisp you like them. Remove, leave to cool and firm up, then tuck in. Alternatively, store in an airtight container; they keep and freeze well, too, so long as they’re wrapped up tightly.9 Alternative usesThese oatcakes are more fragile than the commercial kind; if you end up with a few leftover crumbs, try scattering them with a little sugar over fruit and baking, or on macaroni or cauliflower cheese, or toast and toss them with pasta or with yoghurt and honey – anywhere you want to add a bit of crunch, really.Explore more on these topicsFoodFelicity Cloake's masterclassBiscuitsBritish food and drinkVegetarian food and drinkSide dishesBakingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Additionally, ultramarine blue has a lower refractive index than black iron oxide.” Baki added that this creates less opaque colour, which also helps to reduce what is known as the “grey cast”.The new work, which has yet to be published but is to be presented at the spring meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS), reveals how the team looked at the impact of including ultramarine blue by creating 20 powder foundations and 18 stick foundations in both darker and lighter shades.The researchers analysed the colour of the powders using a spectrophotometer, as well as assessing them visually both on specialised paper and when applied to the inner forearms of participants.Keep it real with a new take on contouringRead moreBaki added that ultramarine blue helps in both darker and lighter foundations by enabling the creation of different undertones, but can be transformative for the former because it reduces the grey cast.“Based on our research, we recommend combining black iron oxide and ultramarine blue. However, ultramarine blue can be used alone as a dark pigment as well. It depends on what skin tone and undertone needs to be achieved with the foundation,” said Baki.“For very dark skin colour, ultramarine blue may not be enough to match consumers’ skin tone value, as it creates lighter foundations when compared to black iron oxide at the same percentage. If a dark colour needs to be created, combining black and blue can provide a more skin-like colour than black iron oxide alone.”The study provides examples of how to create more inclusive foundation lines for consumers. “Ultramarine blue should be added to foundations for all shades to expand the undertones for the same shade and create more skin-like foundation shades,” Baki said.Explore more on these topicsMakeupBeautynewsShareReuse this content"

No longer are they reserved for soft, brown stews (although I love those, too); you can use these legumes to make so many vibrant, flavour- and texture-packed meals. Both of today’s dishes are nourishing and would make excellent sides for a weekend feast, but they’d equally also be fabulous for a midweek dinner.Purple sprouting broccoli, bean and walnut bake (pictured top)Prep5 minCook35 minServes4 as a main, 6 as a side100g walnut halvesSalt and pepper400g purple sprouting broccoli50g butter1 onion,peeled and sliced50g flour600ml whole milk125g mature cheddar,grated¼ tsp freshly grated nutmeg580g jarbutter beans, or 1½ 400g tins butter beansHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Pop the walnuts on a small baking tray and toast for seven minutes.Fill a large saucepan with water and bring it to a boil. Season with a tablespoon of salt, then, working in batches, drop in the broccoli spears stalk side down and blanch for two minutes. Lift out into a colander and leave to steam dry while you blanch the remaining broccoli.Melt the butter in a saute pan over a medium heat, then add the onion and cook, stirring often, for 15 minutes, until soft and just taking on some colour. Tip in the flour, cook, stirring, for two minutes, then gradually add the milk, whisking in each addition until smooth before adding more. Bring the sauce to a boil, then simmer, stirring so it doesn’t stick, for two minutes, until the sauce thickens.Take the pan off the heat, then stir in 100g of the cheddar and the nutmeg, and season to taste.

It’s the end of a spiritual month and Muslims around the world share many Eid customs, including seeing family, preparing food and wearing new clothes.Celebrating traditions from Palestine, Syria, Lebanon and Algeria, five Australia-based chefs share what they will be cooking this Eid.Algerian couscousView image in fullscreenSanah Djebli’s Algerian couscous.Photograph: DjebliSanah Djebli, co-owner of Sydney’s Café TanjaRamadan is not just about abstaining from food. It’s about truthfulness – something we can all learn from | Shadi Khan SaifRead moreDuring Eid, we usually have breakfast then visit my grandmother who would have been awake for hours preparing couscous. It’s a long process – the semolina is steamed, spread with butter or ghee and mixed by hand, then steamed again. The secret is to never let it touch the water. At the end, the whole house smells like buttery steam.We serve it topped with slow-cooked vegetables and a spiced tomato-based sauce that’s common in Algeria.There’s no written down recipe for anything. But that’s the beauty of it: to learn to make it, you have to spend time with your family.Ma’amoul (semolina cookies filled with dates)View image in fullscreenSarah Shaweesh making ma’amoul.Composite: Sarah ShaweeshSarah Shaweesh, owner of now-closed Khamsa Cafe in SydneyEach day when we break our fast during Ramadan, I cook small dishes, catering for my guests’ cravings. Eid is different – we celebrate around food all day. A substantial meal is mansaf, Palestinian whole lamb with rice, but I get most excited about ma’amoul, a cookie filled with dates, walnuts or pistachios. They taste like heaven.In the morning, we wear new clothes, go to prayer and afterwards go visiting from house to house, starting with the eldest family member. Everywhere we go we eat ma’amoul.When I was a kid I wasn’t allowed to help with ma’amoul but, because I love to cook, eventually I was taught everything. The biscuits are made from semolina dough, flattened into discs and folded around mixtures of pounded pistachio, walnut or dates. Each ma’amoul is pressed into a mould, each one shaped differently so you know the filling, then baked and dusted with icing sugar.Last Eid at Khamsa, we prepared ma’amoul with friends who have no family in Australia and everyone went home with a box.Khubz harra (chilli bread)View image in fullscreenLebanese chilli bread on the barbecue.Photograph: Alaa El FouaniAlaa El Fouani, chef and co-owner of Shareef’s in SydneyIt’s said loved ones who have passed away are waiting for you to greet them on Eid, so in Lebanon we would visit the cemetery early in the morning. Afterwards we’d go to my grandparents’ and our grandfather gave us money to buy fireworks.For lunch we’d have khubz harra. It’s made from barbecued Lebanese bread spread with chilli and topped with shish meat, plus parsley, tomato, onion, hummus and hot chips, then rolled like shawarma.Usually only adults barbecue but I’ve always loved to cook so at 14 I learned to make khubz harra. I’ve been in Sydney for many years but I still make it for my family every Eid.Wara’a eneb (vine leaves filled with rice and lamb)View image in fullscreenVine leaves ready to be rolled.Photograph: Racha Abou AlchamatRacha Abou Alchamat, chef-owner of Sydney catering business Racha’s Syrian KitchenGrowing up, my favourite part of Eid was gathering at my grandfather’s house in Syria. My dad has nine brothers and sisters; their husbands, wives and kids made about 50 people, which is a lot to feed. We used to make kilos of vine leaves filled with rice and fatty lamb (wara’a eneb).My aunties sat around the kitchen table, placing spoonfuls of filling on leaves and closing the edges together like rolling a cigarette. The rolled vine leaves were placed in a big pot layered with garlic, lemon, salt and pieces of lamb cutlets, neck or tongue. The fattier the meat, the nicer the flavour. Once the pot was full, flat vine leaves were laid on top, pressed down with a weight. Then the pot was filled with water, more lemon, garlic and salt and left to boil for a few hours.When it was finished, we removed the broth, then put a big tray over the top of the pot to flip the vine leaves out. It was always like magic when the dish came out on to the tray.I left Syria in 2007. It’s just me, my husband and two kids in Sydney, and I feel sorry my kids didn’t have a chance to experience Eid back home. But I try to connect with people here, sharing our culture. I often make wara’a eneb for my catering customers. I’m so happy to share my stories and food with them because I think it’s important to reflect where you came from.Recipes for Ramadan: Karima Hazim’s warak enab (stuffed vine leaves)Read moreKa’ak (ring-shaped biscuit filled with date paste)Huda Albardawil, chef-owner of Melbourne catering business Huda’s Kitchen RulesSweets are very important at Eid in Palestinian culture. When I was a girl in Qatar, I remember all the women in the family would gather at my Teta’s house during the last few days of Ramadan to make ka’ak, a ring-shaped biscuit filled with date paste, as well as ma’amoul.Women would organise themselves in groups, some preparing dough, others making date paste – removing pits, adding olive oil and spices like aniseed. The whole house would fill with the scent. While they were working, they would talk and gossip. I remember watching them and feeling privileged to be part of this amazing culture.One Eid, Teta said, “Habibi, come next to me and do this ka’ak”. My mum protested but my Teta said, “We need her to learn”. I’ll never forget that moment. She encouraged me and I made a perfect ka’ak.Our recipe for ka’ak comes from a long line of women in our family. When my grandmother gave it to me, she said I must keep making it as part of our Palestinian heritage. Now every Eid when I make ka’ak in Australia, I start by saying a prayer to her, to ask her soul to be with me. I feel she’s all around me, giving advice and supervising. Making ka’ak was the thing she loved most, and I’ll keep the tradition alive, passing it down to my children and grandchildren.Explore more on these topicsAustralian food and drinkAustralian lifestyleEid al-FitrFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But miners are working there againSteven MorrisWed 26 Mar 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 26 Mar 2025 13.29 EDTShareThe workspace would not suit everyone. A soggy, gritty, cramped cavern 50 metres beneath a Welsh hillside accessible only by a series of ladders that drop through craggy holes into the darkness.But a smile spread over Dai Walker’s grime-caked face as the miner described the challenge of hunting for gold in the hills of north-westWalesand the joy when he and his colleagues find a few specks.“It’s hard work, it’s not a place for the weak.” he said. “But when you see a bit of gold, it’s special. It makes you keep going back. I love the history; I like thinking about all the miners that have been here over the years. There’s hardly a family around here that doesn’t have a connection with the mine.”This is a big moment in the history of theClogau St David’s mine near Dolgellauin Gwynedd. Clogau used to be the UK’s richest goldmine, with members of the British royal family using the precious metal from the hills of Eryri (Snowdonia) in wedding bands for more than a century.By the 1990s Clogau was considered exhausted, but in 2018 a company calledAlba Mineral Resourcesacquired a licence and embarked on a programme of rehabilitation and exploration, deploying modern technology to try to track seams of gold.It has now revealed that gold has been extracted from Clogau once again and this weekendan auction for a 1oz (28g) coin made from its goldto celebrate the revival of the site – and to test the keenness of the market for the metal – will begin.“It’s an important moment for us,” said Mark Austin, the chief operating officer and senior geologist. “It’s been quite the journey.”Gold hunting in these hills is not something to rush. Over the last five years the team has painstakingly drained flooded tunnels, removed hills of spoil left by their predecessors, often by hand, and made the parts of the network they need to access secure enough to satisfy modern safety regulations.They had to showNatural Resources Walesand theEryri national parkthat the water extracted from the mine would not harm the river that tumbles down the hillside and make sure they did not disturb the bats living in the old mine.Austin said they had found gold in spoil heaps, left by the miners who worked here from 1854, and that they had pinpointed what they believed to be untapped reserve after drilling into the hillside.View image in fullscreenA coin minted from gold extracted from the mine is being auctioned with a guide price of £20,000 to £25,000.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe zone they are focusing on has been named the Llecfraith payshoot, which has the geological make-up associated with Welsh gold.What they are looking for in particular are quartz veins with a “stripey and dirty” texture. A motto of the old-timers was: “Mine the streaky bacon, not the white elephant.” “There’s definitely gold there,” said Austin. The question is how much and how accessible it is.The Guardian was taken down to “level five”, where blasting and digging is taking place. There is no easy way in and it is not comfortable: anyone entering has to wear a harness in case they slip from one of the ladders, and manoeuvring through the cracks and low tunnels is a challenge. It isn’t quiet; the constant drip of water echoes around the confined spaces.Walker was working the vein at the payshoot, extracting ore that had previously been blasted from the rock face, loading it into a bag 0.7 tonne at a time. It is then hauled to surface ground level, transferred to a small wagon and rolled out along an old railway track into the fresh air.There in a small plant, the ore is crushed and hammered and poured on to shaking tables. The flecks of gold, because they are heavier, separate and are sent on to a refinery.View image in fullscreenA miner at the site in north Wales.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianIn the office, George Frangeskides, Alba’s chair, described the economics of the operation. He said this was not (yet) a fully fledged mining operation but “bulk sampling”. “It’s a pilot plant, a boutique mine,” added Frangeskides.When the mine last closed, gold was valued at less than a couple of hundred pounds per ounce; now it is more than £2,300. Sometimes Welsh gold, because of its rarity and its royal associations, can fetch five, 10 or 20 times the spot price.The coin that is being auctioned, which features an image of a dragon atop the nearby mountain ofCadair Idrison one side and miners from the site’s golden age on the other, has a guide price of £20,000 to £25,000.A maximum of 10 or 12 people work at the site, including veterans of previous mining in the Dolgellau gold belt, but if the gold they suspect is in the hillside is found, it could mean many more jobs and a boom for an area that relies heavily on tourism and agriculture.“We’re throwing everything at it,” said Frangeskides. “The UK mining industry has been in the doldrums but there are success stories coming in.” He citeslithium finds in Cornwallandgold mining in Scotland.At Clogau they may soon know whether they are sitting on a fortune. “The only way is to blast it, bulk sample it, process it, see what the grade is,” said Frangeskides. “That’s the name of the game. We’re on the cusp of proving this thing up. This is the crunch time.”Explore more on these topicsWalesMiningGoldCommoditiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He boasted of his government’s achievements, of hiring new teachers and attracting youth to an aerospace and technology conference.The pro-government cable channel NTV carried news of the efforts of the finance minister, Mehmet Şimşek, to stabilise the economy. Neither channel broadcast footage from the protests, which were sparked by the arrest of the Istanbul mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu. Neither did they interview protesters. Though NTV was running a headline that said hundreds of people had been arrested, mirroring statements made by the interior minister.Substantive coverage of the protests has instead been the preserve of the small slice of newspapers and cable channels that exist outside the well funded and slick pro-government broadcasting networks. The opposition-aligned newspaper Cumhuriyet, for instance, has carried news of the conditions inside a maximum-security facility where İmamoğlu has been held, and speeches by another opposition leader to rapturous crowds of thousands.“This is the negative outcome of what Erdoğan has built for two decades, which is a highly polarised, toxic media environment,” said Erol Önderoğlu of Reporters Without Borders, pointing to the spread of cable channels and media companies with longstanding financial ties to the government.“Erdoğan now controls about 85% of national and corporate media inTurkey, so we’re not talking about a fair media environment where pluralism truly flourishes,” he said.This imbalance is laid bare in the coverage of the protests. Murat Somer, a political science professor who studies polarisation at Istanbul’s Özyeğin University, said when pro-government channels do cover the opposition or demonstrators, they portray them as a threat.“If you listen to the pro-government media, you are hearing that the protesters are a bunch of vandals who are insulting Erdoğan,” he said. Demonstrators are described as “aggressive and hostile, but also weak and unable to accept that Imamoğlu has committed crimes”.View image in fullscreenTurkey’s government media watchdog has banned the broadcasting of live footage of the protests.Photograph: Murad Sezer/ReutersTurkey’s government media watchdog (RTÜK) has banned the broadcasting of live footage of the protests, although this sparked a row within the body, whose membership is designed to reflect the makeup of the Turkish parliament.İlhan Taşcı, an RTÜK official from the opposition, posted on X that bureaucrats called the managers of major television networks “and issued threats that they stop live broadcasts or their licenses would be revoked”. The RTÜK president, Ebubekir Şahin,responded, telling Taşcı “there is no need for disinformation. The state and its institutions will do what is necessary.”Live footage of the protests would dispel much of what the pro-government channels have said about them, said Somer. “If there was live coverage, it would show a well-attended peaceful event – yesterday there were thousands of people singing and it almost looked like a concert,” he said. “But they can’t show this. It’s disinformation, it’s as simple as that.”This skewed coverage prompted opposition leader ÖzgürÖzel and other members of his Republican People’s party (CHP) to call for a boycott, targeting businesses that they claim have deep financial ties to the government or fund its media apparatus. The boycott list includes a popular coffee chain, Turkey’s widely loved chocolate producer Ülker and media organisations including the state broadcaster. Özel has also called on the government to allow İmamoğlu’s trial to be broadcast live.Ten photojournalists were detained in dawn raids this week, withseveral charged by prosecutors the following day and facing jail time.“As we know, images are powerful, and with these latest protests we’ve seen so many remarkable ones in the international media, showing that Turkey’s democracy is resisting with so many people in the streets again,” said media expert Emre Kızılkaya, of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government.“Some of the photos we’ve seen are documenting police brutality with remarkable visuals, and this may have alarmed the Turkish authorities.”Most Turkish people get their news from television, but overwhelming government control means the few channels critical of the government or loyal to the opposition are constantly weathering heavy fines from the regulators. This pressure has only increased since the protests began, including the live broadcast ban, further fines, and arrests targeting employees of opposition channels.Kızılkaya pointed to the crackdown on live broadcast and detentions of journalists who reported from the protests as preventing news that helps to “capture the essence of these protests”.Opposition-aligned channels, he added, were unable to reflect the mood by interviewing demonstrators on the street or showing clashes with the police.“Media organisations that are critical of the government see themselves as playing their last game,” he said. “They see these protests as vital for the future of the right to properly inform the country … the future of journalism is on the line now.”Explore more on these topicsTurkeyProtestRecep Tayyip ErdoğanEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Lego and tardigrades, predicts Sandy Edwards, who is among many readers to nominate the mighty, tiny tardigrade. Edwards, from St Andrews in Scotland, says: “Survivalists! When it comes to the end of the world, they, and Lego, are all that will remain!”Mirko Tosoni, based in Amsterdam, is another fan. “They are the only one who ever survived five mass extinctions on Earth – talk about resilience! They also live in the most uninhabitable places, from the moon to the deepest sea, and yet are around us every day, too, in the moss of your garden, for example. Don’t we all need more resilience in this messed-up world we live in?”We are all feeling vulnerable at the moment. In gloomy geopolitical times, when we feel small and powerless, we are drawn to similarly small species whose resilience carry a message of hope.And none are more resilient than the tardigrades, a phylum of eight-segmented micro-animals that measure less than a millimetre long.Our nominee, the 0.5mm-longMilnesium tardigradum, survived in outer space when plonked there as part of a European Space Agency experiment. Tardigrades can endure radioactivity, most cancers, extreme cold, scorching heat, zero gravity, being shot from a gun and being trapped in a freezer for – wait for it – 30 years.Most remarkably of all, this astonishingly tough invertebrate is also incredibly cute. When the German zoologist Johann August Ephraim Goeze discovered these animals in 1773 he named them the “little water bear”. They’re also affectionately known as moss piglets, as their cute, plump forms can often be enjoyed if moss or lichen is put under a microscope.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Tardigrades evolved in water, and require a film of water around their bodies to enable them to survive. If they are exposed to freezing or drying, theyenter a desiccated state called a tun. In this state, they can survive for many years – instantly reviving when they encounter water.Tardigrades: Earth’s unlikely beacon of life that can survive a cosmic cataclysmRead moreWith such superpowers, tardigrades have survived all five great extinction events. They’ve been making a living on Earth for 600m years, and they are already a hugely popular choice among us latecomers to the existence party.Milnesium tardigradumis found in all kinds of habitats, all around the world, and has gathered eloquent nominations from readers in France, the US, Canada and Britain.Whatever humanity hurls at them, the tardigrades will shrug it off and continue their plodding long after we are just a thin layer of plastic in the soil.So vote indestructibility, vote cute moss piglet, vote Milnesium tardigradum.Between 24 March and 2 April, we will be profiling a shortlist of 10 of the invertebrates chosen by readers and selected by our wildlife writers from more than 2,500 nominations.

Students have faced suspensions and expulsions over encampment demonstrations and other actions, as schools crack down on participation.Now, at least five students and academics of color at US universities have been targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), as a part of the Trump administration’s ongoing push to punish noncitizens over their support of Palestine.“What we’re seeing is the use of immigration law to go after visa holders, permanent lawful residents, [over] their speech,” said Samah Sisay, a staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR). “He’s trying to suppress political speech that goes against what the administration wants.”Despite white students, professors and academics also being heavily involved in pro-Palestine protests, people of color have disproportionately faced sudden arrests and threats of deportation or had their visas revoked.“We’re just seeing the focus on very specific people,” said Sisay, referring to academics of color. “I think it really is to try to create a wedge in solidarity, the multiracial, multiethnic solidarity that’s been created in support of Palestinian human rights.” Ice’s actions, she said, have “set a warning for students of color at these universities who rely on scholarships and educational support to improve their lives or better the situations for their family”.Columbia student protester sues Trump administration for trying to deport herRead moreYunseo Chung, a 21-year old Columbia student and legal permanent resident who moved to the US from South Korea at age seven, is currently in hiding after Ice officials attempted to detain her. Chung attended a few pro-Palestine demonstrations over the past months, and was arrested on 5 March at a protest at Barnard College. On Tuesday, a federal judge granted Chung a temporary restraining order to prevent Ice from detaining her, until the court rules otherwise.Momodou Taal, a Cornell University student who led pro-Palestine demonstrations, had his student visa revoked and was asked by Ice officials to surrender due to his political activity. Taal, a dual citizen of the UK and the Gambia, is now taking legal action against the Trump administration.Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia graduate student and Palestinian activist who led on-campus protests, was among the first student activists to be detained by Ice, earlier this month. Khalil,who wrotethat his detainment “was a direct consequence of exercising my right to free speech as I advocated for a free Palestine and an end to the genocide in Gaza”, is being held in a Louisiana detention center.The targeting of immigrant students for their political activity is “worrisome” and “unprecedented” in of itself, said Gabriel Chin, a law professor at the University of California, Davis. “At least since the 1950s, lawful permanent residents, according to the supreme court, have first amendment rights and can speak on matters of public concern,” he said. “What’s going on in the Middle East is a matter of public concern.”The Trump administration has justified the attempted deportations of student protestors by saying they are threats to national security. Chung was accused of having “engaged in concerning conduct, including when she was arrested by NYPD during a pro-Hamas protest at Barnard College”,according to a statementfrom the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).View image in fullscreenBadar Khan Suri.Photograph: Georgetown UniversityIn the case ofKhalilandBadar Khan Suri, an Indian post-doctoral student at Georgetown University who was also arrested recently for his activism, the administration cited a rarely invoked immigration law that allows a person’s legal status to be revoked if their presence has “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States”. According tothe DHS, Suri, who is accused of having “close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, a senior adviser to Hamas” – his wife is of Palestinian descent – allegedly “[spread] Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media”.Trump’s current actions against pro-Palestine immigrants are a “test”, said Sisay, who represents Khalil, to see if the courts will allow him to move forward with targeted deportations of other activists. “This is a broad enough and discretionary provision in immigration law that gives the secretary of state for the executive branch an abundant amount of power to just pick and choose who they want to deport from the country,” she said.The Trump administration’s attack on immigrant academics is only one example in a long history ofUS immigrationlaws being wielded unfairly against people of color, said Chin. “Back when the immigrant stream was white, there was leniency and flexibility in the immigration system.” After 1965, as more immigrants of color arrived in the US, “the opportunities for leniency became fewer and fewer”. Chin added: “The bottom line is the immigration system has become harsher because the people subject to it are people of color.”A Palestinian American medical student objected to working alongside IDF soldiers. The university suspended herRead moreThe latest developments come as the Trump administration and Republicans at large have continuously taken aim at pro-Palestine actions on US campuses, claiming that such actions are antisemitic and hotbeds of Hamas support. Earlier this month, Trump announced that Columbia University would lose $400m in federal funds for its handling of university-wide protests; in response, Columbiacapitulated to several administration demandsas a first step to resecuring its funding.Such conflation of pro-Palestine support with terrorism is a continuation of the Biden administration’s position thatlargely labeleddemonstrations as antisemitic. In the face of Trump’s second administration, universities “are buckling under pressure”from Trump, despite previously purporting to be guardians of free speech and upholding campuses as sanctuaries from Ice.Several students have sought legal representation to shield themselves against deportation efforts. But the ramp-up of attempts to target noncitizen protesters “is just the start”, said Sisay. “It’s generally the message that anyone engaged [in] activism, advocacy or issues that this administration does not support could be targets,” she said. “Unfortunately, I think that’s where we’re headed.”Explore more on these topicsUS universitiesUS immigrationUS campus protestsPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warUS educationTrump administrationanalysisShareReuse this content"

This week, Guardian Documentaries has released a short film about the life and legacy of the Black Panthers with a focus onthe group’s children. It was released alongsidea Long Read by Ed Pilkingtonin the US on the wider group. I spoke to one of those cubs in the film, Ericka Abram, about her childhood within the activist community in the 1970s, and how her life was shaped by the experience. But first, the weekly roundup.‘I lived in a protected Panther bubble’View image in fullscreenEricka Abram is carried by her mother, Elaine Brown, at a rally calling for the release of Bobby Seale, the national chair of the Black Panthers, in Oakland, California, 1971.Photograph: Stephen Shames/PolarisThe first thing I notice about Ericka is that she is deliberate in her articulation and her responses are meticulously considered. She is also warm and quick-witted, with a flair for a killer line. She will not argue with people online about Donald Trump, she says, because it’s a waste of time to engage with a “bot, a baby or a bigot”.Ericka is the daughter of Elaine Brown, a former chair of the Black Panther party, and Raymond Hewitt, one of its leaders. She spent her early years in Oakland, California, and theBlack Panther party she grew up inwas not only a political organisation, but also a social one. The cubs lived in dormitories and had their own school. At weekends, they could return to a home where adult members of the party lived together and played an equal role in their care – “comrade moms” is how she describes the women she lived with.Ericka had no idea her childhood was anything out of the ordinary. Even though reporters showed up at their schools, and she had seen her mother and Huey Newton, the co-founder of the Black Panthers, on television, she did not have a sense of how outsiders perceived the party. I ask her if she was aware of the risks involved for her family and the wider network. “It just felt like family,” she says. Despite this, she shares a chilling story about her mother’s bodyguard stopping a seven-year-old Ericka from opening the door of their house and rebuking her, because he was the first person who should walk out, in case someone shoots.The full picture did not start to become clear until she was in high school, years after her mother left the party and took Ericka with her. She recalls someone once telling her: “Your mother is the only woman in US history to lead a paramilitary organisation.” Ericka says it was “strange” to hear her mum being described like that.She recalls a community that was deeply activist but also, perhaps counterintuitively, apolitical. Ericka tells me it often shocks people that she not only had no insights on the internal politics of the Black Panthers, but she had almost no idea what the party actually was. “The Black Panther party and the reasons it existed were unknown to me. [This is] because I wasn’t suffering racism or sexism; I lived in a protected Panther bubble.” The group participated in boycotts with farmworkers, who successfully secured better working conditions and union rights, and Ericka “hated” that party members couldn’t eat grapes and things she thought were delicious. But the boycotts were explained to her in such a way that she grasped that there were overlords who needed to be forced to play fair. She says from an early age she understood capitalism as synonymous with greed.View image in fullscreenPower to the pupil … Ericka Abram says attending a non-Black Panther school for the first time was full of conflict for her.Photograph: Kendall Bessent/the GuardianLeaving that bubble was a sharp adjustment. When Ericka was eight her mother left the party and moved to Los Angeles, and the experience of attending a non-Black Panther school for the first time was full of conflict. “I had fights frequently – arguments with my teachers – most of it was about injustice. One teacher put me out of class because I said Australia was founded by prisoners and bigots or something like that. I was in seventh grade.” Another time she was ejected from class for sitting quietly during the pledge of allegiance. “I might not have understood the values that were raising me, but as soon as I was removed from them I needed them most,” she says.I ask how she adjusted to living in the mainstream. Her answer is unequivocal: “There was no place for me in American society.” That might have led to her finding refuge in drugs, says Ericka, who started using cocaine when she was 15. “I was trying to medicate a pain I didn’t understand. And living a life I hadn’t any intention of living.” As a child, she had assumed she would one day become a Black Panther. When that life did not come to pass, a profound sense of effacement took hold. “I developed this idea that unless I die for the people, my life was worthless,” she says. Growing up in an organisation with such a clear purpose raised the hurdle so high that one may as well not try to scale it. That’s what comes “from being raised by people who knew what they were willing to die for”, she says.I suggest that she is describing a sort of nihilism and erasure. Well, yes, is her answer. Ericka has always believed that individuals do not matter. “We were raised to believe we were precious – but we were precious for a purpose. I went to school with a kid called Bullet. I mean, there’s no pressure there.” Ericka says at times she felt she did not live up to expectations. As a teenager “I felt I had failed my mother,” she admits casually. I stop her. Why? “Because when we left [the Black Panther party] there was nothing to protect us from America. I thought I could protect her but I didn’t understand what that meant.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWith such a legacy, I wonder if she harbours any resentment towards her mother, or indeed that generation of Black Panther parents, for not preparing their children for life outside the party? “No,” she says, before I finish the question. “I didn’t feel resentment. But I remember I was about to start my sophomore yearwhen Huey Newton was killed. I felt so alone. And I realised that I wasn’t mourning his death but that, even at the age of 19, some part of me thought that as long as he was alive, someone would still come and tell me what to do.” As she holds back tears, there is such plaintiveness and loss in her voice. For a moment, she is again that 19-year-old faced with figuring life out on her own.And it feels as if she has. Ericka’s sense of failure has been replaced by an understanding that what theBlack Pantherssigned up to was something exceptional. She refuses to call herself a cub, because a cub grows up to be a Panther. And she is not that. “They really did promise their lives to an ideal,” she says.The values she grew up with are serving her well during atumultuous time in US political history. “I know that I see the world in a unique way,” Ericka says when I ask how the Black Panthers shaped her life. She understands now that the difference between “activists and revolutionaries is what you are willing to risk” – and that without solidarity, nothing can be achieved. The Black Panthers were not just seeking racial equality but interconnection between all who are suffering the depredations of state and capital. There is in Ericka a clear understanding that what it takes to stabilise politics in a country roiled by a second Trump administration is a combination of empathy but also resolve – action guided by love.The Black Panther Cubs: When the Revolution Doesn’t Comeis out now.

The last column coveredwhat to do with your 23andMe account after the company filed bankruptcy. If you’d like to skip to a section about a particular tip, click the “Jump to” menu at the top of this article.If you’re a visa or green card holder with plans to travel to the US, reports of people being turned away at airports over messages found on their devices might be prompting you to second-guess your travel plans. You might be asking whether Customs and Border Protection (CBP) can search your phone, whether you can opt out and what you should do to minimize your risks.The short answer is that yes, CBP can search your devices. Constitutional protections are generally weaker at US borders, including airports. You can try to opt out, but depending on your specific circumstances, you might not be willing to risk the potential ramifications of not complying, which can include the confiscation of your devices.Privacy experts say everyone should conduct a personal risk assessment – which should include your immigration status, travel history and what data you might have on your phone. There’s not a one-size-fits all solution because data that may seem sensitive to some may not be to others, depending on your circumstances. That assessment might affect your calculus of whether to push back if CBP attempts to search your phone, for instance, or how much you want to lock down your devices before heading to the airport.Opt out: how to stop tech companies spying on your phone as Trump promises mass deportationsRead moreWhile CBP said it only searched about 47,000 devices of the 420 million people who crossed the US border in 2024, experts the Guardian spoke to say border enforcement has been unpredictable under the Trump administration, so figuring out whether you’re at risk of a device search is not as straightforward as it once was. French officials said a French scientist wasrecently turned awayat an airport in Texas because immigration officers found texts that were critical of Trump on his phone.“The super-conservative perspective is to assume they are completely unhinged and that even the most benign reasons for travel are going to subject non-citizens to these device searches,” said Sophia Cope, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a non-profit digital rights group.If you’re a US citizen, you must be admitted into the country. That said, some jurisdictions allow CBP to work with the FBI or local police to advance domestic investigations, so there are still some risks of your devices being searched for domestic reasons.There are steps you can take to make it harder for CBP officers to access your device and the data on it. So what should you do to protect the data on your phone from being searched? The main thing is to prepare ahead of heading to the airport. Here is what you should be thinking about:Decide if you will comply with a phone searchBefore you travel, start to prepare for the possibility of being pulled into secondary screening. First, you should decide if you’re going to comply if an immigration officer asks if they can search your device. They may ask for your phone password or for you to unlock the device. Ideally, you would unlock the device yourself and not share your password. You can decide not to give your consent, but that does come with its own risks.From aguide to the borderfrom the EFF: “This presents a no-win dilemma. If a traveler complies, then the agents can scrutinize and copy their sensitive digital information. If a traveler declines, then the agents can seize their devices and subject the traveler to additional questioning and detention.”It’s possible that, if you refuse the search, the officer might decide that you are not worth the trouble because you do not present a high risk. They might let you go. On the flip side, though, declining could make the process longer or could result in border agents confiscating your device. If they do confiscate your device, make sure you ask for a property receipt so you can document that they have your device when you try to get it back. Even if you don’t give up your password, immigration officials can use various tools on your device to unlock it themselves. They can also try to guess your password, so make sure you have a strong and long password.There are a lot of reasons you might not want to risk being held back longer than you already have been or risk having your device confiscated – including that you don’t know how long border agents will keep your phone.If you plan to comply with a phone search to avoid any further complications, your phone might be searched either manually or with forensic tools. It is worthwhile to prepare for both types of searches.Turn your phone and Face ID off before entering the USThe EFF recommends turning your devices completely off before entering the US. This could return your phone or laptop to a heightened security state and, as a result, could make it harder for anyone to break the encryption on your device.Privacy advocates also recommend making sure your device requires a password to decrypt or unlock. If you use Face ID or a fingerprint to unlock your phone, for instance, it would be easier for an officer to use it to gain access to your device.Do not wipe your phoneYou might think the most protective options are to completely wipe your phone before traveling, use a burner or travel without a phone. But the EFF’s Cope said that could actually raise suspicions.“People are damned if they do and damned if they don’t,” Cope said. “If you cross the border with no data on your device, that itself can be seen as suspicious.”Instead, if you want to seem cooperative but do have data or texts stored on your phone that you wouldn’t want to be accessed, Cope suggests deleting that information selectively rather than wiping your whole device.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionEncrypt your data and use a strong passwordThe most important step to take before you travel is to encrypt the data on your device, which is different than using encrypted messaging services like Signal. Device encryption can make it harder for CBP officers to access files on your phone or laptop or recover deleted files, even if they confiscate the device and subject it to sophisticated forensic tools.Fortunately,all recent modelsof both iPhones and most Android phones come with full-device encryption automatically turned on. On an Android, double check that yours is on in the “advanced settings” tab of your “Security” menu. You will want to choose a strong password that is not easy to guess so CBP can’t walk in the front door to your device. Here’s agood primeron how to make a strong password.“This encryption is only as good as the encryption passphrase someone uses on their device, though,” said EFF senior staff technologist Bill Budington. “So the best advice is to choose a strong, nine- to 12-random-character (or four- to five-word) passphrase for the device, and make sure that biometric unlocks like Face ID or Touch ID are turnedoffwhen going through sensitive areas like checkpoints or somewhere your device could be confiscated.”Laptops, on the other hand, do not all come with full-device encryption. You can use the encryption tools some of them offer to encrypt your data. MacOS has a tool called FileVault, which you can access by searching for it in the top right corner of your screen, and some Windows computers come with a tool called Bitlocker, which can be used to encrypt your device. The EFF has a full list of tools you can use on various operating systemshere.For those of you traveling with a device owned by your employer or someone else, you will want to make sure to have a conversation with them before you travel to ensure your device is sufficiently protected.How to securely delete your dataIn addition to encrypting your devices, you should delete any specific texts, apps, photos, etc that you feel are sensitive or you wouldn’t want a government agent to see.Securely deleting this data requires a few steps and comes with limitations. If you are not wiping your phone entirely, as that may raise suspicions, you will probably opt to delete specific files. That more practical option may be effective for a manual or cursory search but may not be sufficient in the event of a more advanced search byUS immigrationpersonnel. Files may not be fully deleted, or there may be references to these files that remain on your device.On top of ensuring your device is encrypted, you will want to make sure that you’ve deleted your files from any trash folders as well. On iMessage, for instance, if you click on “filters” in the top left corner you’ll find a “recently deleted” folder. Make sure you’ve cleared texts from there as well. On iPhones, once a file isdeletedfrom both the main iMessage interface and the “recently deleted” file, it is permanently deleted, according to the company.Cope suggests pre-emptively deleting some apps your don’t want to be searched. This protective method is imperfect because an advanced search could reveal that an app was installed, but it would be a way to avoid having your WhatsApp messages searched, for instance, in the case of a manual search.Move things on to a cloud storage serverDuring law enforcement searches inside the boundaries of the US, a cloud storage server is not more protected than your devices. At the border, however, there are currently policies in place that prohibit CBP from searching online cloud services. In practice, that means that immigration officers will have to put your phone in airplane mode before searching it.“They do specifically say officers are only authorized to look at data that are ‘resident on the device’,” Cope said. “So that is data that is actually on the hard drive of your phone, laptop or camera. They’re supposed to disconnect it from the internet, if it’s an internet-connected device.”If you have data that you don’t want to or can’t delete permanently for any reason, you can delete it off your device and store it on your cloud storage like iCloud, Google Drive or Microsoft One Drive.This is a high-level guide that may not touch on the specifics of your situation.

Among them were a group of Israeli soldiers who escorted the settlers inside the village where Ballal lives.“Because I work for a human rights organisation called Haqel: in Defense of Human Rights, and because I’m also a photographer, I went there to document what was happening,” he said. “I took three or four photos, and then I realised that the situation was deteriorating. There were dozens of settlers, and they were becoming increasingly aggressive.”Masked settlers with sticks started attacking Palestinian residents, including a group of Jewish activists, smashing their car windows and slashing tyres, according to Josh Kimelman, an activist with the Center for Jewish Nonviolence (CJNV). Videoprovided by the groupshowed a masked settler shoving and swinging his fists at two activists in a dusty field at night.“In that precise moment, I thought about my family, who were at home,” Ballal said. ‘‘I ran to them and told my wife, ‘Lock the house and keep the children inside.’ They could have attacked me, but by doing so they wouldn’t have harmed my family.”One settler, escorted by two Israeli soldiers, walked straight over to Ballal’s house. Soldiers started shooting in the air to prevent anyone from supporting Ballal, who was shouting for help.‘Like a punishment’: witnesses describe Israeli settler attack on No Other Land directorRead more“The soldiers pointed their rifles at me while the settler from behind began beating me,” Ballal said. “They threw me to the ground, and the settler started hitting me on the head. Then a soldier also began beating me; with the butt of his rifle, he struck me on the head. After that, he fired his weapon in the air. I don’t understand Hebrew, but I gathered that he said the next rifle shot would hit me. In that moment, I thought I was going to die.”Injured, handcuffed and blindfolded, Ballal and two other Palestinians were moved by the soldiers to a military vehicle and then to a police station in theWest Banksettlement of Kiryat Arba, where they spent the night on the floor and were forced to sleep under a freezing air conditioner.Ballal said he was beaten by IDF soldiers while in detention. “It was a revenge for our movie,” he said. “I heard the voices of the soldiers, they were laughing about me … I heard [the word] ‘Oscar’.”His lawyer, Lea Tsemel, said the three received only minimal care for their injuries from the attack and that she had no access to them for several hours after their arrest.A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces denied Ballal was beaten in detention. They said: “The claims that the detainees were beaten during the night at an IDF detention facility were found to be entirely baseless.“IDF forces facilitated medical treatment for the detainees after the initial transfer of the suspects to the Israel police, and throughout the night the detainees remained in a military detention facility while handcuffed in accordance with operational protocol.”The spokesperson did not respond to Ballal’s allegations that he was beaten by IDF soldiers in front of his house.View image in fullscreenHamdan Ballal (second from right) with his co-directors at the 97th Oscars in Hollywood earlier this month.Photograph: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagicBorn in 1989 in Susya, Hamdan Ballal Al-Huraini went on to become a film-maker, photographer and human rights activist. He won acclaim as co-director ofNo Other Land(2024), which exposes Israeli settler violence and the displacement of Palestinian communities in Masafer Yatta between 2019 and 2023.Earlier this month, he and the film’s other directors appeared on stage at the 97th Academy Awards in Los Angeles to accept the Oscar for best documentary.The joint Israeli-Palestinian production has won a string of awards, starting at the Berlin international film festival in 2024. It has also drawn ire in Israel and abroad. The mayor Miami Beach in Florida proposed ending the lease of a theatre that screened it. Israel’s culture minister, Miki Zohar, has called the Oscar win “a sad moment for the world of cinema”.“We won the Oscar just three weeks ago, and the violence has escalated,” Ballal said. “Not only against me, not only against the activists and other crew members of the film, but against all the residents.”The No Other Landco-director Yuval Abraham claimed on X that the US Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organises theOscars, “sadly, declined to publicly support Hamdan Ballal while he was beaten and tortured by Israeli soldiers and settlers. Several US Academy members – especially in the documentary branch – pushed for a statement, but it was ultimately refused. We were told that because other Palestinians were beaten up in the settler attack, it could be considered unrelated to the film, so they felt no need to respond.“In other words,” Abraham added, “while Hamdan was clearly targeted for making No Other Land, he was also targeted for being Palestinian – like countless others every day who are disregarded. This, it seems, gave the Academy an excuse to remain silent when a film-maker they honoured, living under Israeli occupation, needed them the most.”The Academy has been contacted for comment.The Israeli military designated Masafer Yatta in the southern West Bank as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered residents, mostly Arab Bedouin, to be expelled. About 1,000 people have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards, and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time.During the war in Gaza, Israel has killed hundreds of Palestinians in the West Bank during wide-scale military operations, and there has also been a rise in settler attacks on Palestinians.CJNV shared details of at least 43 attacks in the village of Susya since the beginning of the year, perpetrated by violent settlers.“They won’t stop here,” Ballal said. “The settlers will continue to attack us. I’m more scared now than before.“After what they did to me,” he added, “I fear it could now happen to others.”Explore more on these topicsWest BankPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaOscarsDocumentary filmsNo Other LandnewsShareReuse this content"

It looks almost as new as the day they installed it in their kitchen because his unique diet does not require much cooking.“It’s more or less a decoration,” said the retired corrections officer from Fond du Lac,Wisconsin. “We needed it to fill the space in between the cupboards.“There’s nothing to make me want to use a stove ever.”Then there’s the booth with his name on it at the McDonald’s closest to his home. It is inside the second iteration of that McDonald’s, which was opened in 2008 on the same property but on a spot just over from its torn-down predecessor.Gorske says the booth marks the exact location where he proposed marriage to Mary, when that location was still a parking lot outside the original McDonald’s there. And that booth is where he prefers to dine on the Big Macs he occasionally chooses to eat at the restaurant. Most Big Macs he brings home to refrigerate or freeze and then microwave to cut down on gasoline expenses – as well as to ensure he never loses access to his favorite burger in the event of, say, a blizzard.“That’s a special spot to me,” said Gorske, referring to his booth. He added that he appreciates how the owner of that McDonald’s has also put up a picture of him on a wall there.Gorske’s gargantuan collection of Big Mac containers is another of the visuals created by his life’s pursuit that he considers to be the most striking.He stored the cartons in his attic until it ran out of capacity in 2006. Since then, Gorske has been keeping his containers in his basement – but they have stacked up so high that it tends to overwhelm visitors who get to see his collection.“You can rub your hand over just hundreds and hundreds of cartons,” Gorske said. “And what I always tell people is that – how I look at it – is it’s time. You know, every two cartons is a day of my life, and it’s kind of a weird thing when you see something like that.”Two cartons in particular which are neither in his basement nor attic – but permanently in his freezer – hold the last Big Macs he bought from the torn-down McDonald’s outside of which he proposed to Mary, with whom he has a son. He regards them as a dear memento.“The wife jokes that she probably will just throw them in the coffin with me because I’ll never get around to eating those,” Gorske said.Gorske said he channels much of the rest of his free time into participating in local senior bowling leagues four times weekly. He doesn’t have a cell phone or a computer and therefore doesn’t surf the internet, though he understands from loved ones that many are aware of his record-setting affinity for the item that most McDonald’s eateries list as No 1 on their menu.He reiterated advice he has given before for people who are potentially thinking about gunning for his Big Mac eating crown: don’t.“For somebody to want to do that, you’re going to have to eat Big Macs for 50 years … and you’re going to have to really like Big Macs,” Gorske said. “It’s such an easy thing for me to do because I already do it every day.“I’m just one of them people that can eat Big Macs constantly, and it’s not going to affect my health at all.”Explore more on these topicsGuinness World RecordsWisconsinMcDonald'sfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How to let go of a grudgeResentment is natural when you’ve been wronged, but over time it can become bitter and self-defeating. Psychologists explain how to move onEmine SanerWed 26 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 26 Mar 2025 08.02 EDTShareAt some point in the late 70s, during a Brownies meeting, something happened to Deborah that she has never been able to forget. Well, she can’t actually remember exactly what the incident was, but she knows the perpetrator – another girl, who still lives in her town. “I think she might have pushed me,” says Deborah. “I think she might have said something mean to me.” Whatever it was, she has held a “deep grudge against her for 46 years”.It affected her deeply at the time. Deborah (not her real name) had been bullied at school, but says she doesn’t hold grudges against those people. Brownies was different – it was supposed to be a safe, happy place, and this girl ruined it for her. It hasn’t had a huge impact on her life, but the grudge – and the negative association – seeps into her mind every time she spots the woman. “It happens quite a lot.” She might bump into her in a shop or drive past her. “She’s always been a shadow in my life.”Grudges are deceptive little things. Once they take hold in the heart, they become the guest that doesn’t know how to leaveThey still have friends in common. Recently, Deborah went to a birthday party and the woman was there. She says the woman has no idea how Deborah feels about her: “She can’t even remember being in Brownies with me.” This makes things worse, she says. “I think it’s difficult to get over a grudge if they don’t know you have a grudge against them, or why.”She could confront her, but doesn’t think it would help. “She might apologise, but if she can’t remember then it feels a bit meaningless.” Instead, Deborah is resigned to living with it. “It’s not eating away at me, like it did maybe the first 10 years. I’m pleasant to her – I’m not mean – but there’s always this little thing at the back of your mind, gnawing away.”View image in fullscreenGulls … difficult to forgive.Photograph: mtreasure/Getty Images/iStockphotoIf you are someone who holds grudges, you may recognise this feeling. I hold many. Every time I go past a shop in my town – a shop that wronged me egregiously in 2016 – I surreptitiously flick them the V-sign, a gesture now so ingrained that I often find myself doing it automatically. I could have exacted revenge with a blistering online review and then moved on, but instead I choose year after year of this futile pettiness. A 2022 survey found that a typical British adult holds six grudges, which seems incredible – I could easily gather six new grudges each week. A small selection: at least one ex, eight local businesses, a Vinted seller, a fox, my old dentist. Not too many past colleagues, but certainly several celebrity interviewees. I harbour animosity towards gulls for countless crimes against me and my loved ones. I have boycotted countless companies for so long, I can no longer remember the reasons. My grudges feel like warm companions, or pets I like to keep close – there is a reason you “hold” one, or “nurse” one – and I have no intention of giving them up.But maybe I should. Grudges, it is fairly well established, are bad for us. People who hold grudges are more likely to have lower levels of mental wellbeing, and even experience depression.Forgiveness is associated with lower stress levels, lower risk of heart disease and mental illness, and may lead to a longer life. You only need look at the worst people in public life, and the way they wield grudges, to want to distance yourself from them.View image in fullscreenFred Luskin.A grudge can be enjoyable, says Fred Luskin, a psychologist and director of the Stanford University Forgiveness Project, and author of The Forgive for Good Recovery Workbook. “Short doses of anger release dopamine, which is a pleasure chemical.” This is fine in the short term, but the issue, he says, is when the grudge goes on too long. “The problem with dopamine is not that every now and then you might release a tiny bit of it, but if you do it too much, it will make it harder to get pleasure from things you should be getting pleasure from. The pleasure centres in the brain have been captured.”Robert Enright, professor of educational psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a pioneer of forgiveness research, says short-term anger is “probably a good thing because it shows: ‘I am a person of worth – people should treat me that way.’” Your anger may be justified and if it does turn into a grudge, that probably comes with enjoyable feelings such as a sense of empowerment or self-protection. “But then there’s this tendency, if we’re not careful, for grudges to turn on us. Grudges are rather deceptive little things. Once they take hold in the heart, they become the unwelcome guest that doesn’t know how to leave.” They can transform into anxiety or blanket mistrust.It’s natural to have a grudge for a short time – a day or a week – “because sometimes your mind needs to mull over what to do about things,” says Luskin. It can last much longer, he points out, when “things are so painful it takes a while to process.” Finding out your partner is having an affair with your best friend, say, is not something you will get over in a week, “because it disrupts your whole life and somehow you have to figure out how to move on. A grudge needs to be time-limited. It’s just not helpful to keep it going for too long.”Holding a long-term grudge, Luskin says, “amplifies helplessness. When you have a grudge against something, you’re saying, ‘I don’t really know how to cope with it, and all I can do is get pissed off and say nasty things.’ That teaches you a lack of efficacy and self-confidence – so grudges are a sign of weakness.”View image in fullscreen‘Ruminating over past hurts means we are reliving them rather than moving forward.’Photograph: Posed by model; Husam Cakaloglu/Getty ImagesPhysically, they can also have an impact, he says. “Every time you think of the thing that upsets you, you have a stress response. You’re filled with adrenaline and cortisol, and those are not good for you after a while, so a grudge is not in your best interest.”By keeping us tied to a negative experience, says Elena Touroni, consultant psychologist and director of the ChelseaPsychologyClinic, it reinforces those feelings of “anger, resentment or betrayal. This can increase stress levels, disrupt sleep, and even contribute to anxiety or depression. Grudges take up mental space – ruminating over past hurts means we are reliving them rather than moving forward.” They are so powerful, she says, because “grudges often stem from a deep sense of injustice. When we feel wronged, our brains hold on to that memory as a way of protecting us from similar harm in the future.”Some grudges can last a lifetime, and some people are more inclined to hold them than others. “Those with a high sensitivity to injustice or who struggle with letting go of control may find it harder to move on. Personality traits such as high neuroticism, which is linked to anxiety and emotional instability, or a strong sense of moral rigidity can also make grudges more persistent.”View image in fullscreenLinda Blair … ‘Be merciful rather than harsh on yourself.’Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianThe clinical psychologist Linda Blair says that grudges can come “from a place of rigidity, that we feel someone has broken our rules. And that’s very narrow because, of course, why should we expect that our rules are universal rules?” Many grudges arise because of unmet expectations. We may also consciously, or subconsciously, fear being in the wrong. “If you could be merciful rather than harsh on yourself, you would say, ‘Yes, I was wrong, and I need to apologise.’”Enright suggests asking yourself if you are in control of the grudge, or if it is in control of you: “For example, if it is starting to affect sleep or your energy level, or even how you interact with others.” Then, he says, it’s time to think about letting it go – although this is hard in our society, because we are not used to practising forgiveness.Joe, whose father left his mother for another woman, recognises that his teenage grudge against his stepmother harmed himself and his father in the long run. “I guess it was a legitimate grudge at the start, but, as time went on, I held it for no reason. The grudge just took over.” A few years later, Joe met his stepmother, not long before she died, and realised that he could have been building a relationship with her. “The impact of holding that grudge for so long was that my dad really didn’t get to experience that feeling of having me and her in his life at the same time.”It was an early lesson, he says, in trying to view a situation from someone else’s perspective, and how that might have changed his own experience. “Everyone has their own way of looking at a situation, and you need to open your mind a bit and understand it’s not black and white. In the first instance, maybe there’s a good reason why you should have a grudge – because you need space, or time, to come to terms with something – but after a while, the longer you hold it, the more bitter and self-defeating it becomes.”View image in fullscreenRobert Enright.Photograph: Althea Dotzour/University of Wisconsin–MadisonForgiveness, says Enright, is “a good idea because the one hurt by the grudge in the long term is the one holding it, rather than those towards whom the grudge is directed.” You can decide to let go of the grudge, says Blair. Once you have defined what it is you are angry about, ask yourself if you can change it. “Almost certainly you can’t, because it will be in the past. And if I can’t change it, why am I wasting my energy on it? And then, what else could I be doing with my energy if I didn’t hold it for this problem?”Ask yourself, she says: if this was happening to a friend of mine, what would I advise? “We’re much more logical and kinder to our friends than we are to ourselves, and that might give you the solution.” She also advises talking it through with a friend, “preferably someone who doesn’t know the person or circumstances that you are holding a grudge against, so they can be more objective. Should that fail, you can, of course, talk it through with a professional.”Enright adds that you can decide to be “merciful” to someone you believe has wronged you, “without excusing what the other did. People tend to think in either/or ways. Either you forgive and abandon justice, or you stand firm and you don’t forgive under any circumstances until you get justice. But you can have forgiveness and justice grow up together, so that, as you forgive, ask something of the other, and your ask will probably be more gentle, more reasonable and maybe better received.” You may never be reconciled, but that doesn’t mean you have to harbour the grudge in your own life.Want to develop emotionally? Get to know your inner spiderRead moreTry to start thinking about the person in new ways, so you don’t “think of this person only as the one who engaged in these behaviours against me. Then you see, eventually, do you both have worth as human beings? Once you see that you share commonalities of humanity, and you even share commonalities of being wounded, there’s a tendency to start softening the heart.”Forgiveness, says Luskin, “is that quality of withdrawing the ability that you gave other people to ruin your day.” He recommends practising relaxation techniques every time you are reminded of the original crime, “so you are not so physically captured by it”. It can be helpful, he says, to remind yourself that you won’t always get what you want in life, or that life can sometimes be difficult. “You have to practise some degree of gratitude so you get used to seeing life as both difficultandgood, and that helps to reduce the power of grudges.”The realisation that life might be even better without my trusty resentments and the warming fantasies of revenge makes me think it might be time to let go of my grudges. But the gulls, they are not forgiven.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingMental healthHealthPsychologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What will happen next? Sami Kent and Ruth Michaelson reportIt has been more than two decades since Recep Tayyip Erdoğan became Turkey’s president. Over the years, Erdoğan’s regime has become increasingly authoritarian, eroding press freedoms and removing checks to his power. But in the last week mass protests have erupted. Pouring on to the streets of Istanbul, thousands have defied government warnings and a crackdown by riot police to ensure their voices are heard.Today in Focus producerSami Kent,who has written a book about the history of Turkey, talks toMichael Safiabout the background to the protests. Erdoğan has jailed the one remaining political rival to his power – Istanbul’s mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu. The two men share a similar background and, explains Kent, were both seen as modernisers offering fresh views. Erdoğan was also mayor of Istanbul and was also jailed – coming out of prison a political hero. Now it seems history is repeating itself.Foreign correspondentRuth Michaelsonhas been on the streets talking to the demonstrators. Alongside supporters of Imamoğlu’s party, the CHP, she found many young people who grew up under Erdoğan and now want a dramatic change. To them, she says the protests are not about one man but “about our future in this country. It’s about democracy”. And for them, she says “there is a real sense of joy, of potential with these protests, and a real sense of momentum”.Photograph: Erdem Şahin/EPAExplore more on these topicsTurkeyToday in Focus"

There were telegraph poles and hailstones the size of oranges dropping out of the sky’Interview byChris BroughtonWed 26 Mar 2025 10.57 EDTLast modified on Wed 26 Mar 2025 22.30 EDTShareIam a proud American, although that notion has been politicised to death in this country, where you’re not considered patriotic unless you’re a Republican. For mySpina Americanaseries, I chose to explore a part of the US where people are solidly conservative and won’t budge – partly because they feel abandoned by the rest of the nation.This area is typically referred to as “flyover country”, and has been written off politically, socially and culturally for decades. I wanted to meet and learn about its inhabitants while also sharing my own fears and hopes for our mutual land. It involved making myself vulnerable, but if I only approach people who are like me, what am I really gaining?I approached the owner of the nudist park and gave a speech from a stage, naked, explaining my intentionsI chose a 100-mile-wide corridor through the central US and just started driving, beginning in Texas and working my way up though Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska and the Dakotas to see what I could find. Although I don’t predetermine or schedule anything unless I absolutely have to, I needed permission to photograph inside a prison in North Dakota, to be embedded with the sheriff’s department in Nebraska, and to ride with storm-chasers during tornado season.Shooting storm-chasers involved covering thousands of miles, racing between states as supercell thunderstorms developed and predictions for the most likely place to see a tornado hit the ground kept shifting. I was part of a group of eight led by a meteorologist, though the focus was more on thrill-seeking than scientific study. Long periods of driving and downtime were punctuated by moments of absolute terror – our hair standing up as the air around us became supercharged, there were hailstones the size of oranges, and telegraph poles dropping out of the sky.This was taken after one such incident in Burlington, Oklahoma. A tornado had almost landed on top of us, and a piece of roof flew across a field towards our speeding van before miraculously lifting up. We stopped for a few minutes to gather our senses, and that’s when I saw this woman from our group silhouetted against those ferocious rotating clouds, with the grass blowing in the foreground. Until you’re underneath one, it’s hard to imagine how massive and dangerous these storms are, but I do think this gives a sense of the scale and the chaos.What I had most wanted to capture was a portrait of a storm-chaser in front of a tornado, but I eventually accepted that the shot I envisaged wasn’t going to happen. Generally, I believe the most honest approach to work like this is to do it organically. I photograph things and people as I find them, then ask: “Hey, is there anything else around here you think I might find interesting?”Riders on the storm: the scientists who chase tornadoes - in picturesRead moreThese were rural areas so I expected empty fields and elderly farmers, and I got plenty of those. I did not expect strip joints, but I ended up photographing in three of them. I asked a bartender in Texas: “Hey, what’s going on around these parts?” She said: “Well, I live in a nudist park.” I approached the owner and gave a speech from a stage explaining my intentions to the 150 residents. I was naked when I did that, and also when I took the photographs. They had never allowed a photographer in before, but they realised my intentions were genuine and that it would give them a chance to advocate for their lifestyle.I also spent two weeks documenting a Mennonite community in Kansas, and took a portrait of a pair of Amish guys who had never been photographed before. Many people have been delighted by my picture of a fisherman standing on ice and showing off the pike he’s just speared with a homemade trident. He’s from a tiny town in North Dakota and was tickled pink when I called to tell him he’d been seen all over the world.Yes, I saw political flags on lawns, but I didn’t photograph them, just as I hadn’t included images of Fidel Castro or Che Guevara in my book about Cuba. I didn’t want any of these people to be written off as partisan. Meeting them, I was blown away by how open, curious and hospitable they were, just like all of us are when given mutual respect.Richard Sharum’s CVView image in fullscreenBorn: Texas, 1978Trained:“Mostly self-taught.”Influences:“Early: Cartier-Bresson, Sebastião Salgado, Larry Towell, Jim Nachtwey.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.‘The first thing to say is that I’m a terrible swimmer,” says Amber Butchart, curator of a new exhibition on swimming that opens at the Design Museum in London this week. Growing up, school swimming lessons were “horrible, traumatic” – the cold water, the humiliation, the scrutiny from teenage boys. But something shifted when she moved to Margate 10 years ago and discovered the joy of swimming in the resort’s huge tidal pool, which was built in the 1930s. “This sounds quite pretentious, but it’s this idea of becoming one with the horizon,” says Butchart. “It’s almost like an existential feeling of the vastness of the world and being physically a part of that when you’re immersed in water. It’s transformational.”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Splash! A Century of Swimming and Style explores our enduring love affair with swimming, from Britain’s lido boom of the 1920s and 30s to the Mermaidcore trend which has been all over TikTok in recent years. Among the 200 exhibits are the first Olympic solo swimming gold medal won by a British woman, a selection of men’s Speedos from the 1980s and the iconic red swimsuit worn by Pamela Anderson in Baywatch. Though the exhibition tells the story of swimming through the lens of design and fashion, Butchart was keen to avoid the kitschy stereotypes of “bathing beauties” that often accompany the theme, and to take a deeper dive into the politics of the swimming pool.View image in fullscreen“It’s transformational.” Amber Butchart photographed at the Walpole Bay Tidal Pool in Margate. Photograph: Alun Callender“Obviously it’s a show about design and architecture and fashion, but there are so many social histories, and also wider global histories, that I wanted to try to get in as well, because this idea of outdoor swimming, the sea as redemptive, this is not the case for everyone. There are many communities in Britain that aren’t taught to swim for various reasons. And I’m in Kent, where we have people crossing [the Channel] in small boats which is this enormous tragedy. The sea is not a sanctuary for everyone.”Butchart first had the idea for the exhibition during the pandemic, when indoor pools were closed and her daily swims in the sea became a ritual to be cherished, something “life affirming”. Margate was one of the first British resorts to promote sea bathing as a health cure in the 1700s, so it seems fitting that this is where the story begins. The oldest item on display is a knitted municipal bathing costume that would have been rented to swimmers by the Margate Corporation (the logo is fetchingly stamped on the front) in the 1920s. “What swimwear does is it allows access to public space,” says Butchart. “You can’t go swimming in a public space if you don’t have a swimsuit. So it’s immediately getting into those questions of who has access and who is not given access.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenClockwise from top left: The iconic red swimsuit worn by Pamela Anderson in Baywatch; Rebirth swimwear designed for non-binary and gender non-conforming people; a 1920s Margate Corporation bathing costume; Olympic swimmer Alice Dearing wearing a Soul Cap swim cap. Photographs: Zuma Press/Alamy; Colectivo Multipolar; Luke Hayes/Design Museum; Soul CapButchart, a fashion historian who began her career working in a vintage clothing store, says she has an abiding love for 1950s swimwear, but adds: “I was very aware that so many stories about swimwear in the past promoted particular types of bodies and excluded other types of bodies. So, I wanted to make this a much more expansive show.”One of the items on display is the swimsuit worn by Alice Dearing at the Tokyo Olympics. Dearing was the first black woman to represent Team GB in an Olympic swimming event and co-founder of theBlack Swimming Association. In 2022 shecollaborated withSoul Cap, a company that creates swim caps for people with afro hair, locs and braids. Thecaps were bannedfrom the Olympics in 2021 by the International Swimming Federation on the basis that they didn’t follow the “natural form of the head”. The decision was reversed the following year.As well as examining the social and cultural history of swimming, the exhibition will showcase contemporary designers and architects who are coming up with solutions to improve access to swimming spaces, whether it be theUK’s first beach huts purpose-built for people with disabilities in Boscombe, or a range ofswimwear for non-binary, trans and gender non-conforming people. There will also be a short film fromSubversive Sirens, a Minnesota-based synchronised swimming team whose mission statement is “black liberation, equity in swimming, radical body acceptance and queer visibility”.View image in fullscreenAccessible beach huts in Boscombe, designed by ABIR Architects. Photograph: ABIR ArchitectsNot only does the exhibition look at what we wear in the water, but it also charts the rise of the seaside as a place for showing off the latest fashions – the pier and the promenade doubling up as an outdoor catwalk. “One of the things I love about living at the seaside is that people take more risks with what they’re wearing,” says Butchart. “The sartorial rules can be broken.” One of her favourite items on display is a pair of 1930s “beach pyjamas”. Pioneered by Coco Chanel, this trend flourished in fashionable French resorts such as Juan-les-Pins and Deauville, eventually making its way across the Channel. “It was the first time women were really allowed to wear trousers in public for the first time,” says Butchart.View image in fullscreenWomen on the promenade at Thorpe Bay, Essex, wearing matching beach pyjamas. Photograph: JA Hampton/Getty ImagesThe rise of beachwear coincided with the golden age of lido building, with art deco wonders such as the Jubilee Pool in Penzance popping up in coastal locations around the UK. The magnificent pool – the largest surviving saltwater lido in the country –reopenedin 2016 following an extensive community campaign. Many of our public baths and lidos have not been so fortunate.View image in fullscreenThe art deco Jubilee Pool in Penzance, the largest saltwater lido in the UK. Photograph: Liz Kay PhotographyThe timeline of the exhibition plots the rise of overseas package holidays, the ensuing decline of many British seaside resorts, and the environmental issues facing open water swimmers today. And while the solutions to some problems belong firmly in the 21st century – the ongoing search for alternatives to fossil fuel-derived synthetics for manufacturing swimwear, for example – for others, we must look to the past. Butchart believes that the connection between the seaside and wellbeing that made resorts such as Margate, Brighton and Scarborough fashionable in the 1800s could prove to be their salvation. She points to an initiative in her adopted home town of Margate – afree community beach saunain a recreated Victorian bathing machine – as a perfect example of a “full circle moment”.From the golden age of lidos to sewage in our seas, kiss-me-quick to queer visibility, the scope of the exhibition is as expansive as those horizon views from the Margate tidal pool. Butchart hopes that visitors will find it thought-provoking. But most of all, she hopes it will inspire them: “If people leave the exhibition thinking ‘I just really want to go for a swim’, that would be lovely.”Splash!

He was released in January as part of Trump’s mass pardon.The 69-year-old’s nomination, which needs to be confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate, comes after South Africa’s ambassador to Washington, Ebrahim Rasool,was expelledearlier this month, and amid US claims that South Africa is discriminating against its white minority.Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, had called Rasool “a race-baiting politician who hates America” after Rasool told a thinktank that Trump’s Maga movement was partly a response to “a supremacist instinct”.In February, Trumpsigned an executive ordercutting aid to South Africa, accusing it of racial discrimination against white Afrikaners, who ruled the country during apartheid. The order also offered them refugee resettlement.South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, told reporters on Tuesday he would appoint a “top-class” replacement for Rasool. He added that US funding cuts were “entirely within their own right … and in many ways a wake-up call … [to be] more self-reliant.”The US-South Africa relationship had worsened under the previous US president, Joe Biden, after South Africa refused to take sides when Russia invaded Ukraine. In 2023, the then US ambassador, Reuben Brigety,accused South Africa of supplying Russia with arms.Things soured further when South Africa brought a caseaccusing Israel, a US ally, of genocidein Gaza at the international court of justice. TheUN court orderedIsrael to take measures to prevent potential acts of genocide. Israel, which reacted furiously to the allegations, has until July to answer South Africa’s case.However, Trump’s overturning of norms and spreading of misinformation about SouthAfricahas catapulted the relationship into new territory.“There is just an absolute disagreement on the way in which Ramaphosa and Trump see the world,” said Ziyanda Stuurman, an independent political risk analyst.Trump’s executive order criticised South Africa for its case against Israel.It also claimed that a law signed in January allowing land to be expropriated with “nil compensation” in limited circumstances enabled South Africa to “seize ethnic minority Afrikaners’ agricultural property”. The South African government has said that the US has similar laws allowing the government to take over land for public purposes.Conservative Afrikaner groups that have the ear of Trump allieshave promoted conspiracy theories of a “white genocide” in South Africa.Meanwhile, land and wealth remain concentrated among white South Africans, who make up 7% of the population (about half Afrikaans), while black people represent 81%.“How do you respond when it seems like the main motivation for the breakdown of the relationship is based on a complete and utter untruth, ie that whites are being treated badly,” said Melanie Verwoerd, a former ambassador to Ireland and MP for the African National Congress, the former liberation movement that has led all South African governments since the end of white minority rule.South Africa’s history of successful negotiations to end apartheid, in which Ramaphosa led the ANC delegation, were cause for hope in improving relations, though, she said.Some analysts suggest South Africa could build bridgesthrough Elon Musk, the South African-born billionaire who is leading Trump’s bid to slash the size of the US government. Musk has been increasingly critical of South Africa, with Trump echoing some of his statements.Musk, who wants to expand his satelliteinternet business Starlink globally, hasrepeatedly railed againsta requirement that telecoms investors cede 30% of equity in their South African subsidiary to black owners.On Monday, Musk posted on X: “The legacy media never mentions white genocide in South Africa.”Last week, he criticised the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters party for singing the controversial Kill the Boers song at political rallies. A South African court ruled in 2022 that the song was not meant to be taken literally.Dropping the equity condition could be part of a “pragmatic” deal that doesn’t compromise sovereignty, said Ronak Gopaldas, a director at risk consultancy Signal Risk: “I would focus on the commercial rather than the moral aspects.”Explore more on these topicsSouth AfricaDonald TrumpAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Ten people claiming to be affected by the translocation from Liwonde national park have begun legal action against the International Fund for Animal Welfare (Ifaw), demanding that the conservation NGO construct adequate fencing to protect the 167 villages around the park and compensate local people for the damage caused by the elephants.More than 50 children were orphaned between July 2022 and November 2024 as a result of the translocated elephants, according to local communities. Among the 10 people killed were John Kayedzeka, 31, who was trampled by a herd while working in a field in September 2022 andMasiye Phiri, 31, who died after she was charged by a bull elephant while in the garden with her two-year-old child a year later.One farmer from Zambia said he was walking across his farm when he came across two elephants and a calf, which charged. “I couldn’t run away in time. They stepped on me and then broke off branches and covered me in them,” he said.“I was in Lumezi hospital for four months while my wounds healed … Since that incident, my stomach is swollen on one side. I don’t know what is wrong. I can’t straighten my arm, so I can’t farm. I depend on the well wishes of others to survive,” the 53-year-old said. “I am very afraid to move around on my own, so I tend to stay at home alone. I am in pain all of the time.”Two deaths do not directly involve elephants but have been blamed on the translocation: one person was killed by a hippo displaced by elephants and another by hyenas believed to be trailing the mammals out of the park. Local people say that elephants are also routinely raiding their crops and trampling fields, threatening their livelihoods.View image in fullscreenAlthough elephants have long lived in the park, local people say that the spike in human-wildlife conflict began after the translocation.Photograph: Georg Berg/AlamyThe UK law firm Leigh Day has been instructed to act on behalf of the 10 people against Ifaw in the UK, Zambia and Malawi, potentially bringing the case to the high court in England. Claimants have not been named so far to protect their identities. While elephants have long been in the park, with populations falling due to poaching, local people said the spike in human-wildlife conflict started after the translocation.“My farmland has been destroyed five times. Three times in April 2024. Twice in May 2024. I was growing maize, sugarcane, rice and beans. Everything was destroyed,” said one 73-year-old farmer. “Before the relocation, sometimes I could harvest 35 bags of rice. This year, I have nothing.”Another farmer who lives on the Zambian side of the park, whose father-in-law was killed by the animals, is also part of the case.“My father-in-law was old and he didn’t manage to run away and they trampled him, and he was killed. The news spread across the community and the community members went to help but he had already died,” she said.How a fatal bear attack led an Italian commune to rally against rewildingRead moreIn a statement, Ifaw said it had received notice of legal action in December and rejected allegations of wrongdoing.“Ifaw is deeply saddened by all cases of human-wildlife conflict in and around Kasungu, where it has been working to support government and communities develop sustainable solutions for reducing human-wildlife conflict and promote coexistence,” a spokesperson said, highlighting that Malawi’s government had overall responsibility for its national parks. Ifaw provided technical and financial support, following international best practice while moving the elephants, they said.The elephant translocation was among the largest of its kind and images of the operation were used for fundraising, with pictures of the mammals being lifted by crane described as “scenes reminiscent of the Disney classic Dumbo”. It was athree-way operationbetween Malawi’s national park service and two NGOs: Ifaw and African Parks.View image in fullscreenWildlife officers prepare to translocate an elephant from Liwonde national park to the Kasungu national park in 2022.Photograph: Joseph Mizere/AlamyAnother claimant in the case said they hoped to live in peace with the elephants and wanted the NGO to take steps to protect them.“We need the owners of the elephants to compensate us, they need to barrier the park, if they don’t barrier the park, they should find another way to protect us and our crops. We want to claim the damage and barrier the park. If it is like this next year how are we going to live? We can’t be removed from this place. These are our ancestral places, inherited. If we moved it would take a very long time to settle and start over,” they said.“We can’t do anything as we are just human beings – we know the law, we can’t attack the elephants. We want to ensure there is protection. We are peace-loving people, we don’t want to have a war between us and the elephants. We just want peace.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsAnimalsThe age of extinctionMalawiZambiaConservationConservation and indigenous peopleAfricaNational parksnewsShareReuse this content"

Earlier this year,a landmark inquiry into foreign interferencefound that information manipulation is the biggest risk to democratic institutions.Tuesday briefing: Why every candidate in Canada’s snap election is running against Donald TrumpRead more“Most threat actors remain likely to conduct threat activities and have likely adapted their tradecraft to further conceal their foreign-interference activity, making it even more challenging to detect,” Vanessa Lloyd, deputy director of operations for Canada’s spy agency and chair of the security and intelligence threats to elections taskforce, told reporters earlier this week as the agency laid out its plan to blunt the effects of interference campaigns.Between late January and early February,Chinais believed to have targeted the Liberal leadership bid of the former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, in a “malicious” campaign on WeChat that was viewed as many as 3m times, the security and intelligence threats to elections taskforce said in a news release.On Wednesday, the Globe and Mail reported that former Liberal leadership hopeful Chandra Arya had been disqualified amid concerns over his relationship withIndiaand concerns he could be susceptible to outside influence.Arya, elected to the House of Commons in 2015, was told he was barred from formally entering the Liberal leadership race in later January. Earlier this month, he was also told he was ineligible to run again in his electoral district. In both cases, the Liberal party did not provide further details.According to a security source who spoke to the Globe, while Canada was grappling with the fallout ofIndia’s assassination of a Sikh activist on Canadian soil, Arya travelled to India in August and met the prime minister, Narendra Modi. Arya is not believed to have not informed the government of his meetings.“As a member of parliament, I have engaged with numerous diplomats and heads of government, both in Canada and internationally. Not once have I sought – nor been required to seek – permission from the government to do so,” he said in a statement. “The sole point of contention with the Liberal party has been my outspoken advocacy on issues important to Hindu Canadians and my firm stance against Khalistani extremism.”The Canadian prime minister,Mark Carney, who doesn’t have a seat in the House of Commons, announced late last week he would contest the electoral district of Nepean, previously held by Arya.Carney was asked on Wednesday whether foreign-interference concerns had prevented the party from nominating a full slate of candidates for the current federal election. He told reporters hostile actors were not to blame for the party’s delay in nominating candidates.But accusations of outside influence have also shaken the opposition Conservative campaign, following allegations that India interfered in the 2022 leadership race, with the aim of helping the winner, Pierre Poilievre.The allegations, first reported by the Globe and Mail, suggest the Tory leader’s win was not attributable to outside influence and Poilievre is not believed to have been aware of India’s efforts.“Let’s be honest, I won the leadership fair and square,” he told reporters.But Canada’s spy agency could not share the information with Poilievre because he does not have the necessary security clearance. Poilievre is the only federal party leader who has declined an offer to obtain a security clearance – a position that has received widespread criticism and incredulity.“It’s very weird, because I can’t imagine, from a political perspective, why it’s worth it. I have top-secret clearance, it’s not that hard,” said Lori Turnbull, the director of Dalhousie University’s school of public administration. “It’s very hard for me to get my mind around why a leader who wants to be prime minister would not go ahead and do this. To give your rival something like that, for free, is stupid when you’re fighting a close election.”While intelligence officials have long anticipated and experienced efforts from hostile nations like India and China to sway a federal election, less predictable is the role Donald Trump might play. The US president has launched a trade war with Canada, and threatened to annex the country.Trump has a reputation for sharing false information and his close ally and senior adviser Elon Musk, the owner of the social media network X, has beenimplicated in the amplification of misinformation.Canada’s chief electoral officer, Stéphane Perrault, has said his office was not aware of any specific threats coming from the US.Explore more on these topicsCanadaIndiaMark CarneyChinaArtificial intelligence (AI)IranPakistannewsShareReuse this content"

Among the recipients of the messages was a prominent journalist, who was inadvertently added to the group.“This is very worrying.Canadaneeds to think about what this means in practical terms: is the United States prepared to protect our secrets, as we are bound to protect theirs?” said Richard Fadden, the former head of Canada’s intelligence agency. “Every country has experienced leaks, of varying severity. The problem with this one is that it’s being generated at the highest levels of the US government – and they haven’t admitted that it’s a problem.”Latest Signal leak revelations expose US officials’ lies about what was sharedRead moreCanada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia andNew Zealandhave for decades shared intelligence in a pact informally known as the Five Eyes. But the leak of classified information is likely to put further strain on the group as it weighs how seriously the current American administration takes the handling of top secret information.“When we have intelligence leaks, we admit it, we try to sort out what’s happened and we try to fix it. One doesn’t get the impression today that the US cabinet members will admit there’s a problem,” said Fadden, who also served as national security adviser to Canada’s Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper. “They’re just trying to clean it up from a political perspective. That worries me.”Despite a far more detailed picture of the information leaked to the journalist Jeffrey Goldberg, the White House and key figures in the message thread have redoubled efforts to claim none of the information was classified.View image in fullscreenRichard Fadden in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, in 2021.Photograph: James Park/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesThe Pentagon chief,Pete Hegseth, said on Tuesday that “nobody was texting war plans” in the thread. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, wrote on social media “these were NOT ‘war plans’. This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin.”“No locations. No sources & methods. NO WAR PLANS,” national secruity adviser Mike Waltz wrote on X. “Foreign partners had already been notified that strikes were imminent. BOTTOM LINE: President Trump is protecting America and our interests.”Fadden disputed the “cleanup exercise” by the current administration.“This is intelligence, and it should be kept confidential. It would be useful if somebody in the US administration admitted they made a mistake, acknowledged there were problems, but that on the sharing of critical intelligence, wanted the current relationships to continue,” he said. “I don’t think that is the kind of thing the administration is inclined to do. There are ways to lower the temperature. Their lack of willingness to do that makes it worse.”The use of Signal by senior members of theTrump administrationhas also become a focus of the leak. The commercial messaging app is popular among journalists for its sophisticated encryption but cannot be download on devices issued by the federal government, meaning those involved in the discussions were probably using private phones.“It may well be that Signal is easier, but that’s not the issue. When you join government, you have to accept some sort of restrictions,” said Fadden. “Even though Signal is quite good in terms of encrypting, that doesn’t mean that people who are wandering around with their iPhones can’t be hacked. That is worrying.”The revelations came asCanadagrapples with a rapidly deteriorating relationship with the United States, its largest trading partner and closest military ally.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I would like to think that on things like the sharing of critical intelligence, we would be able to survive.”But Fadden suggests the nature of the leaks – and the denials – will provoke intense conversations among US allies.“Should we think more carefully about what we call ‘Canadian eyes only’ intelligence, or should we continue to share very, very broadly? I imagine that United Kingdom and Australia,New Zealandwill go through the same sort of exercise. The Five Eyes will survive this. But over the short to medium term, it probably will mean a few adjustments.”Canada’s department of national defence declined to comment on the leaks.Explore more on these topicsCanadaUS national securityTrump administrationPete HegsethDonald TrumpUS militaryNew ZealandnewsShareReuse this content"

Police claim one sub-plot – code-named “Green and Yellow Dagger” – included plans to cause social and political chaos by assassinating Lula with poison and shooting the supreme court judgeMoraesdead.Brazil’s attorney general, Paulo Gonet, told the court police investigators had “uncovered a terrifying operation to carry out the coup, which even included killing the president and vice-president elect, as well as that of a supreme court minister”.One assassination plot “envisaged using explosives, military ordnance and poison … [and] the operators only didn’t follow through on what had been agreed because they didn’t manage to … co-opt the commander of the army,” Gonet added, urging judges to put Bolsonaro and his alleged accomplices on trial.Bolsonaro rejected the charges in a lengthy WhatsApp statement sent to allies as the hearing began on Tuesday, calling the case against him “an aberration, the like of which has never been seen before”. “They are accusing me of a crime I never committed – a supposed attempted coup,” Bolsonaro claimed, insisting he had never desired or suggested “a democratic rupture”.In a written statement after Wednesday’s ruling, Bolsonaro claimed he was the victim of judicial persecution designed to end his political career and silence Brazil’s rightwing opposition.“Those in power are focused on ensuring I spend the rest of my life in prison so I can never run for president again,” he wrote.“The Brazilian people are being robbed of their right to choose their leader, and no country can call itself a democracy when its most popular candidate is barred from the ballot through judicial maneuvers,” Bolsonaro added.In court, lawyers for the accused also denied their clients had broken the law, although many stopped short of denying a coup attempt had taken place.Bolsonaro’s lawyer, Celso Vilardi, denied the ex-president had been involved in the 8 January uprising or led a criminal organization that plotted to murder Lula and other top authorities.José Luis Mendes de Oliveira Lima, a lawyer representing Braga Netto, called his client “a man of unblemished reputation” who was not guilty of “any kind of criminal act”.Oliveira’s lawyer, Andrew Fernandes Faris, called the former defense minister “a most honourable man”, and called for the charges against him to be thrown out.The lawyer for Torres, Eumar Novacki, denied his client was part of the “macabre coup drama” and claimed the investigation was filled with “false conclusions”.Demóstenes Torres, representing Santos, also denied his client was part of the plot and attacked the “federal police novelists” he claimed had concocted a fictional narrative about the supposed conspiracy.Ramagem’s lawyer, Paulo Renato Garcia Cintra Pinto, said it would have made no sense for his client to have tried to destroy Brazil’s democracy since he had himself just been elected to congress in the 2022 election.Bernardo Mello Franco, a political commentator for the newspaper O Globo, said he saw little chance of the ex-president avoiding jail. “Bolsonaro will probably be convicted, Bolsonaro will probably be arrested – or he’ll go into exile, he’ll flee the country … From a judicial standpoint Bolsonaro’s cornered,” he said.Bolsonaro’s best chance of a “political resurrection” lay in helping elect a rightwing ally in next year’s presidential election who would agree to pardoning him after taking power. His congressman son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, and wife, Michelle Bolsonaro, were possible candidates.The far-right populist was also banking on support from his most important foreign ally, the US president, Donald Trump, in his quest to avoid jail and ensure his political survival.“Bolsonaro is hoping Trump will be a kind of saviour for him, both politically and judicially. He believes Trump will somehow interfere in Brazilian politics to help him,” said Mello Franco, although he suspected Trump had bigger fish to fry.“Right now, I think Trump seems to have greater priorities than Brazil … [and that] the Bolsonaros are paying more attention to Trump than Trump is paying to Bolsonaro.”Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

They do excellent work, and they have their own bank accounts and are compensated comparably to nationals. They have a lot of benefits, including paid holidays. You can enter the program freely and leave the program,” he said.View image in fullscreenRalph Gonsalves, prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines, speaks in Brussels, Belgium, in 2023.Photograph: Nicolas Landemard/Anadolu Agency via Getty ImagesSince its 1959 revolution, Cuba has been sending medics to both developed and developing countries around the world, includingItaly, Brazil, and countries in the Caribbean and West Africa. Its doctors and nurses have been instrumental in tackling outbreaks such as Covid-19 and Ebola.But under the expanded US policy, “current or former Cuban government officials, and other individuals, including foreign government officials, who are believed to be responsible for, or involved in, the Cuban labor export program” and their immediate family will be subjected to visa restrictions.Cuba’s ambassador to the SVG, Carlos Ernesto Rodríguez Etcheverry, earlier this month described the announcement as a “shameful decision”, saying that it has no legal basis and will deprive millions of people around the world of medical services.‘Giving us oxygen’: Italy turns to Cuba to help revive ailing health systemRead more“We really reject the idea … that Cuban doctors, Cuban nurses are slaves and that the Cuban government is involved in any trafficking issue with regard to our medical brigades. Because we respect our doctors, our nurses,”he told local media.Describing the idea that Caribbean nations are involved in trafficking as “propaganda”, Gonsalves said that Cuban doctors operate private practices in SVG while they are employed by the government, and some apply for permanent residency in the country. “It’s very clear that there isn’t any sort of issue around trafficking as suggested,” he said.Barbados’s prime minister, Mia Mottley, currently chair of the Caricom group of Caribbean nations, told parliament that althoughBarbadosdoes not currently have Cuban medical staff, “we could not get through the [Covid] pandemic without the Cuban nurses and the Cuban doctors”.She added: “I will also be the first to tell you that we paid them the same thing that we pay Bajans, and that the notion, as was peddled not just by this government in the US, but the previous government, that we were involved in human trafficking by engaging with the Cuban nurses was fully repudiated and rejected by us.”Mottley said that “like others in this region”, she is prepared to lose her US visa if “we cannot reach a sensible agreement on this matter”.Caricom met on Friday, 21 March, to discuss Rubio’s visit among other matters, Gonsalves said. During his visit to Jamaica, Rubio will hold bilateral meetings with officials from Jamaica, Trinidad and Barbados, before going to Guyana andSuriname. Gonsalves said that he was sure the issue of Cuban doctors would be raised by Caribbean governments.A statement fromTrinidad and Tobagoannouncing the meeting with Rubio said discussions would “focus on US foreign policy and the effect on Trinidad and Tobago and the wider region”, but did not specify whether the issue of Cuban doctors was on the agenda.Explore more on these topicsCaribbeanCubaHealthCoronavirusBarbadosJamaicaTrinidad and TobagonewsShareReuse this content"

We must accept it and begin planning | Gaia VinceRead moreMore than 5,500 people were forced to evacuate from their homes in Andong, the neighbouring counties of Uiseong and Sancheong, and the city of Ulsan, where the fires were the largest, according to South Korea’s ministry of the interior and safety.South Korean officials earlier on Tuesday had said firefighters had extinguished most of the flames from the largest wildfires in those areas, but the ongoing dry and windy weather caused setbacks and allowed the blazes to spread again.View image in fullscreenThe ruins of the Unramsa temple are pictured after a wildfire devastated the area in UiseongPhotograph: Minwoo Park/ReutersThe Uiseong fire, only 68% contained and exacerbated by strong winds, shows “unimaginable” scale and speed, said Lee Byung-doo, a forest disaster expert at the National Institute of Forest Science.Climate change is projected to make wildfires more frequent, Lee said. “We have to admit large-scale wildfires are going to increase and prepare more resources and manpower,” he told a local television station.mapNearly 9,000 firefighters, along with more than 130 helicopters and hundreds of vehicles, were deployed to battle the fires, but efforts were partially suspended overnight as the winds strengthened.Officials in Andong and Uiseong county ordered residents in several villages and those near Andong University to evacuate to safe locations or temporary shelters – including schools and indoor gyms – as a fire that started in Uiseong continued to spread.The blaze in Uiseong destroyed Gounsa, a Buddhist temple built in the seventh century, according to officials from the Korea Heritage Service. There were no immediate reports of injuries, and some of the temple’s national treasures, including a stone Buddha statue, were evacuated before the fire reached the wooden buildings.View image in fullscreenFire destroys buildings in Uiseong.Photograph: Yoon Gwan-shick/APThe fire also spread to the nearby coastal town of Yeongdeok, where officials shut down roads and ordered residents of at least four villages to evacuate. The justice ministry did not immediately confirm local reports that it had begun relocating 2,600 inmates from a prison in Cheongsong county, also near Uiseong.Human-caused climate breakdown is responsible for a higher likelihood of fire and bigger burned areas in southern Europe, northern Eurasia,theUSand Australia, with some scientific evidence of increases in southern China.Climate breakdown has increased the wildfire season by about two weeks on average across the globe.With Reuters and Associated PressExplore more on these topicsSouth KoreaWildfiresAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

It arrived just days after China’s foreign ministry accused the Albanese government of interfering with its internal affairs.The letter, which contained a picture of Hui and personal details, claimed he was a “wanted person” for a “range of national security related offences including incitement to secession” and “collusion with a foreign country”. It is now being investigated by Australian federal police.The letter also accuses Hui, who fled to Australia via Europe in 2019, of leaving Hong Kong with $3m in proceeds of crime. Hui, who was a pro-democracy legislator in Hong Kong, denies that claim and says it is “fictitious”.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailLast week, Guardian Australia revealeda fake pamphlet pretending to be from Hui’s law firmwas sent to mosques, falsely claiming he was a pro-Israel lawyer willing to “wage war” against Islamic terrorism.

He did not confirm the death of the four US soldiers, but noted that the details remain unconfirmed,” the Nato acting spokesperson, Allison Hart, later told AFP.The Lithuanian army said earlier there was “no evidence or information confirming the death of the troops”.“People [are] working round the clock. Everybody remains on standby, ready to provide emergency medical support,” the Lithuanian defence minister, Dovilė Šakalienė, said on X.Lithuanian authorities received a report about the soldiers’ disappearance on Tuesday afternoon.US Army Europe and Africa’s public affairs office confirmed in its statement that the soldiers “were conducting scheduled tactical training at the time of the incident”.“I would like to personally thank the Lithuanian armed forces and first responders who quickly came to our aid in our search operations,” said Lt Gen Charles Costanza, the V Corps commanding general.More than 1,000 American troops are stationed in Lithuania on a rotational basis.Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are all Nato members and have often had chilly ties with Russia, a key ally of Belarus, since declaring independence from the Soviet Union in 1990.Relations soured further over Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and the Lithuanian president, Gitanas Nausėda, has been one of the most outspoken supporters of Ukraine in its fight against the forces of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.Explore more on these topicsUS militaryLithuaniaNatoEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The US said it was studying the Russian request.At a briefing on Wednesday, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, praised the talks. “We are satisfied with how pragmatically and constructively our dialogue is developing and by how it is yielding results,” he said.A list of Russian and Ukrainian targets to be covered by the energy moratorium had been agreed with the help of US negotiators, Peskov added, a point that had been announced by Zelenskyy the day before. Ukraine’s leader said the energy ceasefire should be ready to come into force from today.Zelenskyy is scheduled to meet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in Paris and attend a meeting of political and military delegations from 31 countries led by France and the UK, represented by the prime minister, Keir Starmer. Together they are trying to stitch together a “reassurance force” to provide security to Ukraine in the event of a negotiated armistice or peace.Details about who will participate and the size of the force have been sparse with speculation that it could contain 10,000 to 30,000 troops plus fighter jet policing to secure Ukraine’s air space, as well as maritime patrols de-mining the Black Sea to protect grain exports.European sources have stressed that the force would not police or be based closed to the current front lines, but the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential office, Ihor Zhovkva, said the reassurance force had to be strong enough to fend off any Russian aggression, if necessary.Though Zhovka said Kyiv had to “first and foremost” rely on its own military, members of any reassurance force had to show a “readiness to fight” and “to be ready to be engaged in the real combat” and recognise that defending Ukraine was “an inevitable part of European security”.Donald Trump has been pressing for a full end to the fighting in Ukraine, declaring on the campaign trail before his election that he could end the war in 24 hours, though earlier this month he described his own statement as “a little bit sarcastic”.So far the parallel negotiations that took place in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, have brought relatively modest results – and raised questions over whether a full ceasefire is possible given the lack of trust between Moscow and Kyiv and ongoing fighting.Overnight, the US president even questioned whether Putin was committed to a peace deal at this stage. “I think that Russia wants to see an end to it, but it could be they’re dragging their feet,” Trump said in a TV interview.“I’ve done it over the years, you know; I don’t want to sign a contract, I want to sort of stay in the game, but maybe I don’t want to do it, quite … I’m not sure. But no, I think Russia would like to see it end, and I think Zelenskyy would like to see it end at this point,” he told Newsmax.Ukraine’s strategy is to engage constructively in the talks, showing it is ready to agree to intermediate ceasefire proposals, and switch the onus on peace to Russia in the belief the Kremlin will raise more pre-conditions.Moscow, however, appears focused on what it can obtain from the US, with Trump acknowledging the US had had discussions about a division of Ukrainian territory with the Kremlin. No such negotiations had been had with Ukraine, Zelenskyy said on Tuesday.On Wednesday evening, during a panel interview in Paris with journalists from across Europe, Zelenskyy said he was “very grateful” for bipartisan support from the US, but he feared some were “under the influence of Russian narratives”. “We can’t agree to those narratives,” he added.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaTrump administrationSaudi ArabiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Without the US, UK, Turkey, Canada, Norway and Iceland, it is impossible to imagine the defence of Europe, and nothing can replace America’s nuclear umbrella, the ultimate guarantor of our security.Rutte also added that he was “absolutely confident that United States remains committed to Nato and to Article Five,” adding:“Don’t just take my word for it.Listen to President Trump, who has repeatedly stated his commitment to a strong Nato.Listen to the strong bipartisan support in the US Congress, and listen to the American people, three quarters of whom support Nato, according to a recent poll.”Share"

Asked about what citizens should stockpile, she referred toa video on her social media, in which she presents an emergency bag.Today, the EU launches its new#PreparednessStrategy.“Ready for anything” — this must be our new European way of life. Our motto and#hashtag.pic.twitter.com/fA1z8ZvMDA— Hadja Lahbib (@hadjalahbib)March 26, 2025To a soundtrack of off-key jazz piano, Lahbib is shown on the video discussing her emergency stockpile in a tongue-in-cheek way, including ID documents in waterproof casing, canned food, bottled water, matches, a Swiss army knife, cash, playing cards, medicines and a small radio.The strategy was devised to ensure better EU coordination and public awareness in response to a range of potential risks, such as extreme weather exacerbated by the climate crisis, pandemics, cyber-attacks and military invasions. “We must prepare for large-scale, cross-sectoral incidents and crises, including the possibility of armed aggression, affecting one or more member states,” the document states.The commission is also calling for a Europe-wide preparedness day to raise awareness; for the topic to be put on school curriculums; and for an EU “stockpiling strategy” to ensure adequate supplies of raw materials, shelters, generators, and “potentially” food and water.While the EU has no powers over civilian or military uniformed services, it has carved out a bigger role in crisis response since the Covid pandemic led to the unprecedented common purchases of vaccines and medical equipment. Now it wants to go further after areport from the former Finnish president Sauli Niinistölast year found there was no “clear plan” on what the EU would do “in the event of armed aggression against a member state”. Nïïnistö, a special adviser to the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU was better prepared to deal with crises and disasters than five years ago, but needed a change of mindset and more planning to anticipate crises.The plans are likely to provoke a mixed response from EU member states, who perceive threats in different ways. Last week, the European Commission rebranded itsmilitary spending plans“Readiness 2030”,instead of Rearm Europe, after complaints from the leaders of Italy and Spain, who argued the language risked alienating people.In contrast,northern European countries have led the way in emergency planning. Swedish authorities recommend keeping at home a good supply of water, energy-rich food, blankets and alternative heating, as well as investing in a battery-powered radio. Norway advises people to stock up on non-essential medicines, including iodine tablets in the case of a nuclear incident. German households have been urged to adapt their own cellars, garages or store rooms for use as bunkers, while housebuilders will be legally obliged to include safe shelters in new homes – as Poland has already done.Roxana Mînzatu, a commission vice-president, responded to accusations of scaremongering, likening preparedness to taking out accident insurance: “It doesn’t mean much more than the fact that you want to be prepared and you want to minimise the damage, the costs, the suffering that you might go through.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It differs from one country to another, but we can learn from each other.”The strategy was published the day after Denmark’s defence ministry announced it was bringing forward plans to introducemilitary service for womenby two years.Women who turn 18 after 1 July 2025 could be required to take part in an annual ballot from next year to determine if they must perform mandatory military service, something which is already required of men.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionEmergency planningEuropean CommissionEuropeExtreme weatherInfectious diseasesNatural disastersnewsShareReuse this content"

The Bavarian conservative leader Markus Söder called it an “attack on rural life” and demanded a special investigation.Cem Özdemir, the acting agriculture minister in the caretaker government, from the Greens, posted on X: “Intimidation and threats have absolutely no place in our democracy. Not against Günther Felßner and his family, nor against anyone else.”Referring to the farmer protests which took place inGermanylast year, Özdemir said: “This applies to everyone, and it applies just as much to gallows, ferry blockades, and all other attacks.”Radical protests have become a polarising force in Germany, with political tolerance for disruptive actions – such as climate activists gluing themselves to runways and farmers blocking streets with tractors – often dependent on the group carrying them out.The outgoing coalition’s cuts to tractor diesel subsidies caused furious protests in 2024 that included sightings of makeshift gallows.In January 2024, a mob trapped the Green economy minister, Robert Habeck, on a ferry with his wife when they were coming home from holiday. Ricarda Lang, the party’s co-leader at the time, was stopped from leaving a party meeting the following month by farmers who lit fires and blocked roads with tractors.Joachim Rukwied, the president of the German farmer’s association, who previously described the ferry blockade as a “no-go”, said on Wednesday he was astonished by the protest at Felßner’s farm and deeply regretted the withdrawal of his candidacy.“Such criminal actions are crimes and have nothing to do with freedom of expression or legitimate protest,” he said. “We must not allow these radical activists to further poison democratic discourse.”He added that he thought activists should not be allowed to bring class action lawsuits either.Middle Franconia police said they were investigating 13 people on suspicion of trespass, two who they understood to have climbed on to the roof and lit a flare.Animal Rebellion, which hung the banner that read “No animal exploiter as agriculture minister”, defended its protest as peaceful and suggested Felßner was using it as an excuse to quit because his candidacy was unpopular. An online petition to stop him from becoming a minister gathered 400,000 signatures.Felßner was fined by a court in 2018 for discharging waste on to his neighbour’s property that polluted the water and soil.He has also alarmed experts by calling on the public to “eat meat for the climate”. Animal agriculture is responsible for 12-20% of the greenhouse gas pollutants worsening extreme weather, and climate scientists have found that eating less meat is a vital step to stop the planet from heating.“An agricultural lobbyist, convicted environmental criminal and science denier is not a suitable candidate for the agriculture ministry,” an activist from Animal Rebellion said in a statement.Explore more on these topicsGermanyActivismProtestFriedrich MerzEuropeFarmingnewsShareReuse this content"

He faces up to five years in prison and a fine of €75,000 (£63,000) if convicted of the offences.Depardieu denies any wrongdoing, telling the court this week: “I deny all of it.”The woman employed as third assistant film director has not been named in the media. She was tasked with accompanying Depardieu from his dressing room on to the set during the filming.She told the court a first sexual assault happened during a night shoot in Paris, when she found herself alone with Depardieu at the end of a short road where his dressing room was located as they walked towards an outdoor set.She said she felt his hand on her buttock. “It happened by surprise; I was shocked. I didn’t know how to react … I carried on as if nothing had happened, kept walking to the set. I had a knot in my stomach.”She said the second assault happened at a later date on a set inside a Paris apartment, where Depardieu blocked her against a door and put his two hands on her breasts. She told the court: “I said no. I was scared.” She said that on a third occasion Depardieu put his hand on her buttocks and she again said: “No.”The assistant director told the court that before this, Depardieu “talked about sex all day on set, constantly talking of ‘pussy’ to everyone”. She said: “He listens a lot, observes everyone, listens to everything and uses it later to humiliate everyone. At the time, I was having a difficult separation. I’d spoken to someone about it, so he mocked me for it. There were lewd comments, humiliations; it was an unhealthy environment.”She said she felt ashamed of what Depardieu had done and did not want to speak out because she wanted to continue working on the film and handle the situation herself. But when her direct superior asked how she was getting on with Depardieu, she told her all that had happened.The assistant director said that, after this, Depardieu shouted at her that she was a “snitch” and he was “odious” to her on set, calling her “crazy”.She said Depardieu later said “sorry” to her in an angry way in front of other crew members. She said Depardieu said he did not want her coming to collect him from his dressing room any longer.She said: “On the set I felt huge anxiety, stress, shame, guilt; it was very difficult.”Asked by the head judge what she wanted from the trial, the assistant director said: “I want us to hear the truth and stop minimising what happened.”Depardieu denied sexual assault. “I did not touch her buttocks, I did not touch her breasts, I did none of that,” he said.He told the court: “I’m not like that. I can’t be like that … I’ve never of my own will touched a buttock like that, even furtively. It wouldn’t cross my mind.”Asked by the complainant’s lawyer about the allegations of touching the woman’s buttocks he said: “I didn’t sexually assault. A sexual assault is more serious than that I think.”Asked to clarify, he said he didn’t know what sexual assault was.He said that at the time, he couldn’t walk 150 metres in the street on his own because of his health, weight and joint troubles. He said he was almost always accompanied by a bodyguard or aides on the film set, and was never alone with an assistant director.Depardieu said of the assistant director:“I think that maybe, I don’t know, she was wary because of my reputation of being vulgar, crude, rude,” Depardieu said. “But I’m not only that. I still respect people.”He said he was not someone “who touches people”.He said that he had later asked the production to make sure it was a man who collected him from his dressing room instead of a woman because he always made lewd comments in his dressing room and didn’t want women to be shocked if they overheard them.He said: “I’m crude and vulgar. I say things that can shock young people.” He told the court that on a previous film he’d said: “Bring me a man who’s not shocked by my language,” and: “Stop putting in girls who are shocked by what I say.”He denied shouting at the assistant director.The French actor Fanny Ardant, a close friend of Depardieu, testified in his support. She said she had never witnessed any inappropriate gestures by him in a long career working together.She appeared in Les Volets Verts but was not on set at the time of the alleged sexual assaults.She called Depardieu an incredible actor and a “genius”, saying “all forms of genius carries within it something extravagant, unsubmissive”.Ardant said: “Yes, he takes up space on set; yes, he has a big mouth, says crude things, likes to play the idiot on a set because people will then be less afraid of his personality ... I knowGérard Depardieu, I’ve heard his shouting, his cries of anger, his provocations ... but I have never witnessed a gesture I found shocking.”Leaving the stand, she approached Depardieu, embraced him and kissed him on the cheek.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsGérard DepardieuFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

At least one appeal to join the protest was circulating on the social media network Telegram.“I don’t know who organised the protest,” one man told Agence France-Press. “I took part to send a message on behalf of the people: enough with the war.” He said he had seen “members of the Hamas security forces in civilian clothing breaking up the protest”.A statement released by family elders from Beit Lahiya expressed support for the protests against Israel’s offensive and its tightened blockade. They also said the community fully supported armed resistance against Israel and rejected “any attempt to exploit legitimate popular demands by a fifth column”, apparently referring to opponents of Hamas.In a separate development on Wednesday, at least nine Palestinians were killed by two separate Israeli airstrikes in central Gaza, medics said.One strike hit a group of Palestinians gathered outside a charity providing hot meals in the Nuseirat refugee camp. At least five people, including a woman and her adult daughter, were killed by the strike, according to the al-Awda hospital, which received the casualties.The resumption of Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip had displaced 142,000 people in seven days, the UN said on Wednesday, warning of dwindling stocks of humanitarian aid.“In just one week, 142,000 people have been displaced,” the spokesperson for the UN secretary-general, António Guterres, said, adding that about 90% of Gaza’s population had been displaced at least once between the start of the war on 7 October 2023 and January of this year.There has been no sign that Israel will open entry points to allow essential aid to flow or ease itsnew offensive.The Gaza health ministry said more than 50,000 Palestinians had been killed in Gaza and another 113,408 wounded since the beginning of the war.AFP, Reuters and AP contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesBenjamin NetanyahuHamasnewsShareReuse this content"

Among them were a group of Israeli soldiers who escorted the settlers inside the village where Ballal lives.“Because I work for a human rights organisation called Haqel: in Defense of Human Rights, and because I’m also a photographer, I went there to document what was happening,” he said. “I took three or four photos, and then I realised that the situation was deteriorating. There were dozens of settlers, and they were becoming increasingly aggressive.”Masked settlers with sticks started attacking Palestinian residents, including a group of Jewish activists, smashing their car windows and slashing tyres, according to Josh Kimelman, an activist with the Center for Jewish Nonviolence (CJNV). Videoprovided by the groupshowed a masked settler shoving and swinging his fists at two activists in a dusty field at night.“In that precise moment, I thought about my family, who were at home,” Ballal said. ‘‘I ran to them and told my wife, ‘Lock the house and keep the children inside.’ They could have attacked me, but by doing so they wouldn’t have harmed my family.”One settler, escorted by two Israeli soldiers, walked straight over to Ballal’s house. Soldiers started shooting in the air to prevent anyone from supporting Ballal, who was shouting for help.‘Like a punishment’: witnesses describe Israeli settler attack on No Other Land directorRead more“The soldiers pointed their rifles at me while the settler from behind began beating me,” Ballal said. “They threw me to the ground, and the settler started hitting me on the head. Then a soldier also began beating me; with the butt of his rifle, he struck me on the head. After that, he fired his weapon in the air. I don’t understand Hebrew, but I gathered that he said the next rifle shot would hit me. In that moment, I thought I was going to die.”Injured, handcuffed and blindfolded, Ballal and two other Palestinians were moved by the soldiers to a military vehicle and then to a police station in theWest Banksettlement of Kiryat Arba, where they spent the night on the floor and were forced to sleep under a freezing air conditioner.Ballal said he was beaten by IDF soldiers while in detention. “It was a revenge for our movie,” he said. “I heard the voices of the soldiers, they were laughing about me … I heard [the word] ‘Oscar’.”His lawyer, Lea Tsemel, said the three received only minimal care for their injuries from the attack and that she had no access to them for several hours after their arrest.A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces denied Ballal was beaten in detention. They said: “The claims that the detainees were beaten during the night at an IDF detention facility were found to be entirely baseless.“IDF forces facilitated medical treatment for the detainees after the initial transfer of the suspects to the Israel police, and throughout the night the detainees remained in a military detention facility while handcuffed in accordance with operational protocol.”The spokesperson did not respond to Ballal’s allegations that he was beaten by IDF soldiers in front of his house.View image in fullscreenHamdan Ballal (second from right) with his co-directors at the 97th Oscars in Hollywood earlier this month.Photograph: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagicBorn in 1989 in Susya, Hamdan Ballal Al-Huraini went on to become a film-maker, photographer and human rights activist. He won acclaim as co-director ofNo Other Land(2024), which exposes Israeli settler violence and the displacement of Palestinian communities in Masafer Yatta between 2019 and 2023.Earlier this month, he and the film’s other directors appeared on stage at the 97th Academy Awards in Los Angeles to accept the Oscar for best documentary.The joint Israeli-Palestinian production has won a string of awards, starting at the Berlin international film festival in 2024. It has also drawn ire in Israel and abroad. The mayor Miami Beach in Florida proposed ending the lease of a theatre that screened it. Israel’s culture minister, Miki Zohar, has called the Oscar win “a sad moment for the world of cinema”.“We won the Oscar just three weeks ago, and the violence has escalated,” Ballal said. “Not only against me, not only against the activists and other crew members of the film, but against all the residents.”The No Other Landco-director Yuval Abraham claimed on X that the US Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organises theOscars, “sadly, declined to publicly support Hamdan Ballal while he was beaten and tortured by Israeli soldiers and settlers. Several US Academy members – especially in the documentary branch – pushed for a statement, but it was ultimately refused. We were told that because other Palestinians were beaten up in the settler attack, it could be considered unrelated to the film, so they felt no need to respond.“In other words,” Abraham added, “while Hamdan was clearly targeted for making No Other Land, he was also targeted for being Palestinian – like countless others every day who are disregarded. This, it seems, gave the Academy an excuse to remain silent when a film-maker they honoured, living under Israeli occupation, needed them the most.”The Academy has been contacted for comment.The Israeli military designated Masafer Yatta in the southern West Bank as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered residents, mostly Arab Bedouin, to be expelled. About 1,000 people have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards, and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time.During the war in Gaza, Israel has killed hundreds of Palestinians in the West Bank during wide-scale military operations, and there has also been a rise in settler attacks on Palestinians.CJNV shared details of at least 43 attacks in the village of Susya since the beginning of the year, perpetrated by violent settlers.“They won’t stop here,” Ballal said. “The settlers will continue to attack us. I’m more scared now than before.“After what they did to me,” he added, “I fear it could now happen to others.”Explore more on these topicsWest BankPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaOscarsDocumentary filmsNo Other LandnewsShareReuse this content"

He said that the lack of access was part of an attempt to “obfuscate what’s going on, and to inject this notion of doubt into information that comes out”.Speaking after he accepted a special fellowship award for the Society of Editors conference, he said that while Palestinian journalists were doing “fantastic work”, he and other international media colleagues wanted to contribute to reporting on the ground in Gaza.“Why don’t they let us in,” he said. “Because there’s stuff there they don’t want us to see. Beginning after those Hamas attacks on 7 October, they took us into the border communities. I was in Kfar Aza when there was still fighting going on inside it. They had only just started taking out the bodies of the dead Israelis. Why did they let us in there? Because they wanted us to see it.“Why don’t they let us in to Gaza? Because they don’t want us to see it. I think it’s really as simple as that. Israel took a bit of flak for that to start with, but none now, certainly not with [President] Trump. So I don’t see that changing anytime soon.”The Israeli government has been approached for comment. However, Israel’s military has previously said that it has escorted journalists to Gaza to allow them to report safely. According to the Foreign Press Association, Israel’s defence authorities have said that journalists in Gaza could be at risk in wartime and could endanger soldiers by reporting on troop positions.Scores of journalists have been killedsince the war started.Asked about whether international media should trust Gaza casualty figures released by the territory’s health ministry, which is led by Hamas, Bowen said the numbers were currently “the best measure that we have” because of the inability of reporters and other bodies to verify them. The ministry says more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed during the war.“I think without question, it’s the bloodiest war that they’ve had since the foundation of the Israeli state of 1948,” Bowen said. “If the place could open up, people could go through, look at the records, count the graves, exhume the skeletons from under the rubble and then they’d get a better idea. But when the doors shut, these things become very, very difficult.”Last year, Bowen was among 50 journalists, including the BBC’s Lyse Doucet and its former presenter Mishal Husain, calling on Israel and Egypt to provide “free and unfettered access to Gaza for all foreign media”.Bowen’s intervention comes with the BBC still investigating the making of the documentaryGaza: How to Survive a Warzone, which was pulled from iPlayer after it emerged that the 13-year-old who narrated the film, Abdullah al-Yazouri, was the son of the deputy minister of agriculture in the Hamas government.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaBBCPalestinian territoriesPress freedomJournalist safetynewsShareReuse this content"

The film also grapples with the issue of sexual violence in India, particularly against lower caste women, and therising tide of anti-Muslimprejudice in the country.Santosh made its debut at Cannes film festival to widespread acclaim. It was the UK’s official entry for the Oscars’ international feature category and went on to be nominated for a Bafta for best debut feature this year, as well as receiving glowing reviews, including five stars in the Observer, whichcalled it a “phenomenal achievement”. Its lead actor, Shahana Goswami, recently won best actress at the Asian film awards.Santosh review – gripping police procedural about the murky side of modern IndiaRead moreThe film was made in India, has an entirely Indian cast and is all in Hindi, the dominant language of north India. The filmmakers had previously submitted the script in order to film in India and had faced no issues. India’s largest cinema chain was also on board to distribute the film in January.However, Indian audiences are unlikely to ever be able to see it in cinemas after censors on the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), a government body which approves all cinematic releases, refused to do so for Santosh over concerns about its negative portrayal of the police.Suri, the film’s writer and director, described the decision by the censors as “disappointing and heartbreaking”.“It was surprising for all of us because I didn’t feel that these issues were particularly new to Indian cinema or hadn’t been raised before by other films,” she said.Suri said the censors had demanded a list radical cuts so lengthy and wide-ranging that they would be “impossible” to implement. Legal restrictions prevented her sharing exact details of the censor’s demands, but she said that the list of cuts was so long it had gone on for several pages, and included concerns about themes relating to police conduct and wider societal problems which are deeply baked into the film.“It was very important to me that the film is released in India so I did try to figure out if there was a way to make it work,” said Suri. “But in the end it was just too difficult to make those cuts and have a film that still made sense, let alone stayed true to its vision.”Suri emphasised that while the film offered an uncompromising depiction of the police, “I don’t feel my film glorifies violence in a way that many other films focusing on the police have done. There’s nothing sensationalist about it.”The decision by the censorship board comes at a time when India’s cultural sphere is seen to be more heavily policed than ever, with films and TV series dealing with politically sensitive themes often targeted with hate campaigns and police cases, or dropped by streaming platforms before they are released.Suri admitted she had been “nervous” about releasing the film in India in the current climate but insisted it was “vitally important” for her that the very people affected by the issues in the film were able to see it. It was the incidentin 2012 of a women raped on a bus in Delhi, commonly known as the Nirbhaya case, that had initially inspired her to make the film and she had collaborated with Indian non-government organisations when building up the story.Police violence and torture is a well-documented issue in India. According to a 2020Human Rights Watch report, police in India routinely use torture and flout arrest procedures with little or no accountability.Depictions of police violence have also previously appeared in Indian cinema but Suri questioned whether the highly realistic depictions in Santosh – as opposed to the often stylised format of Bollywood and other Indian film industries – had caused discomfort among the censors.“Maybe there’s something about this film which is troubling in that everybody is morally compromised and there is no single hero,” she said. “I think that’s what might set it apart from other stories in Indian cinema which often show a maverick cop in a rotten system.”No Indian police figures have responded to coverage of the film, which is set in a fictional north Indian town. The CBFC have been contacted for comment.There is no appeals process or negotiation allowed with the CBFC once their report is submitted and the matter can be contested only in court. However, Suri said she would still keep fighting to have the film available to Indian audiences.“All my work has been about India; one film was deeply nostalgic, another was super beautiful and sensual,” she said, “Yes this one shows another face of the country. But there’s humanity in everybody in this film.”Santosh is currently on release in UK cinemasExplore more on these topicsIndiaSouth and central AsiaCensorshipnewsShareReuse this content"

The cuts will be felt most keenly by those eligible for personal independence payment (Pip), 800,000 of whom will lose £4,500 a year on average.Everything is great, nothing to see here, Rachel Reeves tells MPs | John CraceRead moreDebbie Abrahams, theLabourchair of the work and pensions select committee, told the Commons: “All the evidence points to the fact that the cuts to health and disability benefits will lead to increased poverty, including severe poverty, and worsened health conditions. How will making people sicker and poorer help to drive our economy up and get people into jobs?”Neil Duncan-Jordan, the MP for Poole, said: “We are talking about people’s lives here – my constituents are frightened.“This policy will fuel the social determinants of poverty that ultimately create further pressure on the services the chancellor is trying to cut. And we know cuts won’t bring growth, they won’t create jobs – they will only create poverty.”Many backbenchers are now considering voting against the changes to Pip at a Commons vote, which is expected in May, with rumours that one or more frontbenchers could quit to join the rebels.Rachael Maskell, the Labour MP for York Central, said: “The devastating impact of people losing essential income will fall on disabled people. I will not accept or vote for measures that will put people at risk or push deeper into poverty.”The government’s impact assessment shows just over 370,000 people who currently claim Pip will lose it, while another 430,000 who would have been eligible for the benefit in the future will not now get it.Rachel Reeves does reasonable job of justifying fiscal prudence but welfare cuts cast shadowRead moreA further 150,000 people will lose their access to carer’s allowance – equivalent to one in 10 unpaid carers. The charity Carers UK said they were the “first substantial cuts to carer’s allowance in decades” and would cause “huge anxiety for hard-pressed carers and their families who need every penny they can get to pay their bills”.The average individual Pip loss of £4,500 a year, combined with the loss of £4,250 a year in carer’s allowance, could mean some households lose at least £8,740 a year as a result of the changes. More than 1 million unpaid carers already live in poverty.Meanwhile, 2.25 million people who claim universal credit will be affected by the decision to freeze the health element of the payment, with each losing £500 a year on average. A further 730,000 future recipients will lose an average of £3,000 a year.The OBR said the £4.8bn cuts package was “the largest package of welfare savings since the July 2015 budget” which was presented by the former Tory chancellor George Osborne and included a four-year freeze to most working-age benefits and cuts to tax credits and universal credit.Several Labour MPs voiced their unhappiness during a fractious briefing by Darren Jones, the Treasury chief secretary, to backbenchers on Wednesday afternoon.Of around two-dozen Labour MPs present, more than half a dozen criticised the cuts and as many as four indicated that they would vote against them, according to people present.Jones caused further anger with a lunchtime appearance on the BBC,during whichhe tried to explain problems with how the benefits cuts had been assessed by using the analogy of his children’s pocket money.“If I said to my kids: ‘I’m going to cut your pocket money by £10 per week, but you have to go and get a Saturday job,’ the impact assessment on that basis would say that my kids were down £10, irrespective of how much money they get from their Saturday job,” he said.Steve Darling, the Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesperson, called Jones’s comments “incredibly insulting” and called on him to apologise.Other Labour MPs expressed their frustrations at the Office for Budget Responsibility, whose forecasts forced Reeves to make steeper cuts to benefits than had been expected just a week ago.One backbencher said: “The parliamentary Labour party needs to be raising its voice about the OBR and the fiscal rules. This is driving our constituents into poverty and destroying faith in a Labour government to make tiny numbers on a balance sheet add up.”Additional reporting by Jessica Elgot and Eleni CoureaExplore more on these topicsSpring statement 2025WelfareBenefitsPovertyRachel ReevesEconomic policyDisabilitynewsShareReuse this content"

The national security officials said “no classified material” had been shared in the chat.Republicansare now calling for investigations, as well.According toreporting from the Hill, top Republican senators are calling for various committees to investigate the leak, including the Senate armed services committee and the Senate intelligence committee. The Mississippi senator Roger Wicker, who chairs the armed services committee, told the Hill he would be asking the defense department’s inspector general to investigate the scandal.The national security adviser, Mike Waltz, who reportedly added Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of the Atlantic, to the group chat,took “full responsibility”for the leak on a Tuesday night Fox News appearance. However, he did not describe how the leak happened and trashed Goldberg, calling him “the bottom-scum of journalists”. During his television appearance, Waltz said he started the Signal group chat but unknowingly added a contact that happened to have Goldberg’s number.“Of course I didn’t see this loser in the group, it looked like someone else,” he said.Q&AWhat is Signal?ShowSignal is a messaging app founded in 2012 that allows users to transmit texts, photos, videos and documents, as well as make audio and video calls. It uses end-to-end encryption, which protects messages against hackers and cyberattacks via an extra layer of security. Several other privacy features, such as the ability to automatically delete messages, have made it popular among communities such as journalists and activists that frequently deal with sensitive information.Signal is run by the non-profit Signal Foundation and relies on donations to function, giving it a different business model than other encrypted messaging services such as Meta-owned WhatsApp. It does not track user data to the same extent as Meta and publishes its code to allow for public auditing of its security measures. Signal, like any messaging app, is still vulnerable to human error through methods like phishing attacks or  spyware which can allow hackers to gain access to users’ devices. The Signal Foundation’s president called the addition of The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief a user error rather than a problem with her app’s security.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Tensions are rising among Republicans, with the two wings of the party divided on what should happen with Waltz, according toreporting from Politico.On the one hand, traditional, hawkish Republicans see Waltz as a strong vehicle to push Trump officials towards a more aggressive foreign policy, and advocate for him to stay in the administration. On the other hand, Trumpian Republicans like Vance oppose the hawkish approach to foreign policy. Waltz’s position, for now, seems to be safe, withDonald Trumpcalling Waltz a “very good man”.Despite the prospect of congressional investigations, there are still significant questions left unanswered about the leak, with Waltz and Trump contradicting each other in separate interviews. Waltz on Tuesday said that a staffer had been not responsible for the leak.Newly shared Signal messages show Trump advisers discussed Yemen attack plansRead more“Look, I take full responsibility, I built the group,” Waltz said. But Trump suggested the opposite during an interview.“What it was, we believe, is somebody that was on the line with permission, somebody that worked with Mike Waltz at a lower level, had Goldberg’s number or call through the app, and somehow this guy ended up on the call,” Trump said. His statements were unclear, since the Atlantic journalist had been added to a text chat, not a phone call.The use of Signal for internal government discussions has also been called into question. A non-profit organization, American Oversight, sued members of theTrump administrationon Tuesday afternoon, saying the app’s use violated the Federal Records Act. The organization is requesting that a federal court order the officials to preserve the messages “to prevent the unlawful destruction of federal records”.Trump said on Wednesday afternoon during wide-ranging remarks at the White House as he announced new tariffs, about the Signal group chat scandal: “I think it’s all a witch-hunt.” He added that Signal could be a “defective” platform and said it was “not very good”.The secretary of state Marco Rubio also weighed in while on a visit to Jamaica.Talking to reporters in Kingston, he said of the chat group: “Someone made a big mistake and added a journalist.”Reuters and the Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsRepublicansTrump administrationUS SenateHouse of RepresentativesUS politicsThe AtlanticnewsShareReuse this content"

There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,” Gabbard said.Ratcliffe argued that Signal was “an appropriate channel to communicate sensitive information”, despiteearlier warningsfrom the defense department that it could be targeted by Russian hackers.“I didn’t transfer any classified information. And at the end of the day, what is most important is that the mission was a remarkable success,” the CIA director said.Democrats countered that what was revealed in the group was classified. Raja Krishnamoorthi had an aide hold up the printed Signal messages in which Hegseth shared exact details of the strikes.“This is classified information. It’s a weapon system as well as sequence of strikes, as well as details about the operations,” Krishnamoorthi said. “This text message is clearly classified information. Secretary Hegseth has disclosed military plans as well as classified information. He needs to resign immediately.”Republicans rejected the claims by having Ratcliffe and Gabbard note that details such as the names of the targets or specific locations were not revealed in the chat.“The Democrats are obviously making the assertions that what was in the Signal chat was classified, and claiming that Secretary Hegseth put this war plan out to the world, which he clearly did not,” the Florida Republican Greg Steube said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The answer is no,” Ratcliffe replied.White House security leak: who’s who in the Signal group chatRead moreWhen Ratcliffe and Gabbard appeared beforea Senate intelligence committee hearingon Tuesday, Democrats questioned them extensively about the Signal group, while Republicans either avoided the topic or said they would ask about it in a private session. In the day since, some Republican senators said they woulddemand the Trump administrationinvestigate the group chat.“I think President Trump has handled this matter well,” the Republican senator Lindsey Graham said on Wednesday. “Further, I believe that all the participants in the chat were under the impression they were using an appropriate and secure form of communication.

He estimates being owed about $300,000 from both companies in unpaid wages, including unpaid overtime, meal and rest breaks, and mileage reimbursement.“The more I drove, it seemed, the more I got manipulated,” he said. “One of the big ways you’re losing is the depreciation on your car.”During that time, Russell said he worked 70-to-80-hour weeks, often chasing bonuses or trying to make up for the unreliable and inconsistent pay, and put 270,000 miles (435,000km) on a single vehicle in just over three years before it broke down, just as he finished paying it off.“I get very frustrated when I hear rideshare companies claim it’s a part-time job, it’s not meant to be full time. No. They created a market and business that is relying on full-time labor, so they have to take accountability for that full-time labor,” he added. “They built this massive company on the back of our labor. They were undercutting cab companies. They took losses for years to make this happen. Hopefully they will be held accountable for the law they weren’t following before they wrote their own law, Prop 22. Drivers are entitled to that money.”It’s not just about the earnings … It’s about changing the way that these companies operateBen Valdez, Uber driver since 2015Ben Valdez, an Uber driver inLos Angelessince 2015 who was working 20 to 25 hours a week during the four-year period, said he’s owed nearly $200,000 from the wage theft claim he filed against the company.“The companies need to pay the drivers what they what they’re owed. They took advantage of a lot of drivers during the period of time,” said Valdez. “It’s not just about the earnings. There should be compensation for time based on the hours you actually work. The state of California needs to know that it’s not just about the money owed. It’s about changing the way that these companies operate.”Ibrahim Diallo, a rideshare driver based inSan Francisco, claimed his pay has declined over the years during his time working for the apps.Studies, including those from theUniversity of California, Berkeley, and theNational Equity Atlas, have shown that pay for rideshare and delivery apps have remained significantly low, often below hourly minimum wage rates with expenses, taxes and active working time taken into account, including after Prop 22 was enacted in California. Uber and Lyft havedisputedlow hourly average wages for drivers.“I have struggled recently against homelessness while trying to still work as a driver,” Diallo said to Rideshare Drivers United. “After expenses, many of us are earning less than minimum wage. This is inhumane. We need accountability and for the state to force these companies to make better standards for work.”A spokesperson forUbersaid in an email that “drivers come to Uber precisely because of the unique flexibility that it provides. Prop 22 safeguarded their choice to work independently, while ensuring important new protections.

We don’t know the final count but maybe a dozen left out of an agency that had almost 200 employees through last year,” said a FMCS employee who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. “It is shocking as the agency does not regulate and has always been non-controversial. Even Republicans have always seen the value of an agency that saves the economy far more money in reduced work stoppages in the private sector than the agency spends. It is also a blow to the use of more efficient dispute resolution by federal agencies who have used our services for non-labor disputes. That program has now been entirely abolished.”Teen member of Musk’s Doge staff provided tech support to cybercrime ring, records showRead moreThey noted the cuts were drastic to the point where the agency, in most cases, can no longer be effective and noted it will worsen and prolong labor strikes and lockouts.The FMCS was established by Congress in 1947. Its shuttering comes in the wake ofDonald Trump’sexecutive order, signed on 14 March, to dismantle seven federal agencies, including FMCS.Dedrick added in a LinkedIn post on the dismantling of the agency: “Annually, FMCS saves the US Economy over $500 million by protecting household earnings, safeguarding company revenues and services, and ensuring the continuity of the robust commerce that promotes and underlines our national prosperity.”He noted this savings is achieved with fewer than 150 mediators around the US, accounting for less than 0.0014% of the federal budget.FMCS was contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsBusinessTrump administrationUS unionsElon MuskUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

In an interview with the the Pat McAfee Show broadcast on Wednesday, James said he has little interaction with Jordan.“We don’t talk,” James said. “Because I’m still playing. I’m still playing, I’m still focused on my craft right now.”LeBron James at 40: NBA’s brightest star stares down the dying of the lightRead moreJames said much of the distance is due to the pair’s competitiveness. James has fourNBAtitles and is a four-time Most Valuable Player. Jordan was a six-time champion and a five-time MVP.“I think it’s because I’m still playing,” James said. “And MJ, we all know MJ. Even if you don’t know him personally, he is one of the most ruthless competitors there is and until I’m done and he doesn’t have to look at me running up and down wearing the No 23 and every time my name is mentioned, it’s mentioned with his.”The 40-year-old said he has “hope” he will become closer to Jordan when he retires, saying something similar happened with Kobe Bryant. James said there was some competitive friction between the pair but that softened when Bryant had retired and James joined the Lakers.“That’s when our relationship became really, really good,” James said. “He welcomed me. He called me, like, ‘Bro, anything you need in LA, I got you. You’re a Laker now. You’re family.’ And we would have multiple conversations. Obviously, you guys saw him coming to a lot of games ... And when I passed him for the scoring record in Philly, he had a tweet out there like, ‘Keep on going.’ Like, ‘Keep transcending the game. Keep going.’ And that shit meant so much to me.”James also spoke about his son and Lakers teammate, Bronny. Bronny was drafted by the Lakers last year, amid some accusations of nepotism. He has struggled in early NBA appearances but has spent time in the G-League andscored a career-high 17 pointsfor the Lakers earlier this month.“For me as a dad, it doesn’t matter if he never scores, ever. For me as a dad, I’m just super proud of him, period, as a young man,” said James. “For me as a mentor and as a teammate of his that wants to see him thrive because I have seen the work he’s put into the game, I am super proud of his development to where he is now. From the moment that he was drafted ... to now ... his development has skyrocketed.”Bronnysuffered a cardiac arrest in college, and James described the joy of seeing him recover and make his debut for the Lakers this season.“Us going out on the floor and having that moment, physically I wasn’t even there,” James said. “I wasn’t even there. I’m floating. I could only imagine where Bronny was. We haven’t even talked about it yet. At some point we will. But I wasn’t even there. I was so [happy], I might have been in the rafters. I might have been at home – my body might have been at home watching the game and watching the moment. I completely was not there.”James was also asked about extending his playing career so that hisyoungest son, 17-year-old Bryce, could play alongside his father and Bronny on the Lakers.“Don’t do that to me,” James said with a smile.Explore more on these topicsLeBron JamesNBALos Angeles LakersBasketballUS sportsMichael JordannewsShareReuse this content"

When she told him, she said there was a lot of screaming and he said she was “incompetent” and “stupid”.“I clearly said: ‘Shut up’, because it didn’t stop,” Ingrid told the court in Sandes inNorway. “When I said that, I got a hand in the face. He hit me in the face. It was fast and it was hard. It hurt.”The court was told it was one of seven alleged incidents of physical and verbal abuse to which she was subjected by Gjert, who shot to global prominence after coaching three of his sons to Olympic, world and European glory. Their success was captured in the TV documentary series Team Ingebrigtsen, each episode of which was watched by more than 1 million Norwegians.However, the third day of the trial of Gjert Ingebrigtsen heard of more harrowing allegations that were never captured by the cameras. Gjert, who faces six years in prison if ­convicted of abusive behaviour towards Jakob and Ingrid, denies all allegations of violence.On another occasion Ingrid said that her father had screamed so forcibly at her in the car that she had broken down in tears. She said she thought the incident had occurred after she couldn’t change the radio or check the weather forecast.“He asked me if I was afraid of him,” she told the court. “I think that was very difficult to answer. I remember thinking: ‘What ­happens if I answer yes? What happens if I answer no?’ So I didn’t answer right away. Then I remember he asked again and again until I answered. Then I ended up answering ‘yes’.”Her father could not understand her answer, the judges heard. “It was the stupidest thing he had ever heard,” Ingrid said. “And didn’t drive home until I promised I wouldn’t tell anyone, especially not my mum, because he was afraid of what she would think.”According to the indictment, Gjert is alleged to have abused his daughter “by using threats, coercion, violence, restricting her freedom of movement and violating her in other ways”. The court was told that these incidents included calling Ingrid an “idiot” when she was sick and pushing her with both hands in the upper body so that she fell to the floor after an argument.Earlier in the day, Jakob told the court under cross-examination that the TV series Team Ingebrigtsen was not an accurate portrayal of what went on in the family. “The problem we had with it is that it didn’t reflect reality,” the Tokyo 2020 Olympics 1500m and Paris 2024 5,000m champion said. “A lot changed when the camera crew was present. When they film, it is presented in a more ­humorous and cosy way.”On Tuesday Jakob told the court that he had beenkicked and punched by his fatherwhen he was as young as eight or nine, and that he con­tinued to face other threats as he got older. But when questioned he admitted that he had not seen his father do ­anything physical to his older ­brothers Henrik and Filip – and that when he moved out of the family home at 18 to be with his now‑wife, Elisabeth, he still lived just 300 metres from his father.“That was as far as I dared to go, because I felt I definitely needed my parents’ consent, even though I was of legal age,” Jakob said. “I was afraid that the defendant would ­sabotage my life. He had a lot of ­control over finances, training and things that meant a lot to me.”Jakob, who told the court he had split from his father and coach early in 2022 after he hit Ingrid in the face with a wet towel, said that Gjert had messaged him later that year when he could only win 1500m silver in the WorldAthleticsChampionships in Eugene. “The defendant was happy that I failed,” he said. “And he conveyed that with that message.”The trial, which is due to last until 16 May, continues.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsNorwaynewsShareReuse this content"

Wise words there from TS Eliot, who, to be fair, never had to rebuild a high-end Premier League team while also dealing with closing out a title race, natural era-wastage, and losing your most successful homegrown player since the glory days of Phil Thompson waving the European Cup around in the pub and all that.ForLiverpoolsupporters it seems likely the next month will bring a wildly varying emotional register. Departures and farewells. Winning the league in front of actual non-quarantined humans. The sense, even through the veil of commemorative red smoke, that the team that got you here are finally starting to become something else. Spring is always a time of reckoning up in football, April the cruellest month, all new shoots and final blooms, memories and desires, cheers but also sometimes jeers. So yeah. Let’s see how that pans out for the lads.Real Madrid open up old Liverpool wounds with Alexander-Arnold move | John BrewinRead moreThis is the real point about the news thatTrent Alexander‑Arnold’s move to Real Madrid is all but done. It is, of course, simply confirmation by now. Leaving on a free transfer is entirely on the club not the player, just as it is a bit nuts to suggest Alexander‑Arnold should have signed an unwanted new contract in the hope this might winkle out more money for his soon to be former employer.But it is still a shock for fans to see this finally come to pass. It is also logical and reassuring that this will draw a powerful emotional response. Football is not supposed to be a forgiving place when it comes to this kind of stuff. There is simply no point having a reasoned counterpoint, or suggesting, well, people leave jobs all the time. Football is not hotel management.The emotional response, the tribal element; this is why football has survived more or less in the same form to this day. These are the roots that clutch. This is why it is pointless telling anyone how to feel about things such as this. This isn’t a reasoned discussion. It’s a passion play of ownership and familial bonds, dreams and madness. This quality is also a vital economic asset. The day everyone is just fine with this and says: “Good luck, what’s your new Insta, I’m a Madrid fan now”, is the day football dies as a spectacle worth following.View image in fullscreenTrent Alexander-Arnold was encouraged by Jürgen Klopp not to compromise on his gifts.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAGrief and rage then: these are a necessary corollary. But we will get past them. At which point there is a note of clarity. ForArne Slotthe departure of Alexander‑Arnold is also an opportunity, and a necessary piece of signposting. Sport always moves forward. What is actually happening here, and will now perhaps happen more clearly, is the end of a very distinct era. Who knows, it could be the making of the new one, too.First up, it is necessary to pay tribute to Alexander-Arnold, and in a way that speaks to this dynamic. The Premier League will miss him almost as much as Liverpool, because he is a non-standard footballer, extravagantly skilled and also brittle, encouraged by Jürgen Klopp not to compromise on his outstanding gifts and to become a super‑strength player, in a way that has created so many unforgettable moments.Alexander-Arnold has more assists and more shots than any other career defender in Premier League history. At the same time, while he isn’t exactly a bad defender, he can be a disastrous one. We remember the inadvertent comedy of the 2022 Champions League final‑winning goal, the he’s‑behind‑you pantomime dynamic of Vinícius Júnior sneaking a full 60 yards on Alexander‑Arnold’s blind side to score from a cross, as maddening as it was also comically sigma male, the A-list defender who just will not defend.View image in fullscreenTrent Alexander-Arnold: so casual you half expect to look down and notice he’s wearing flip-flops.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianOn the other side, we have the genuinely sublime and original passing, the full range of angles, vision, cut, fade, variations of pace; always effective but also just so much fun to watch in a homogenised game. Alexander-Arnold is one of the few remaining elite maverick talents, out there making the game interesting, moving about with that familiar mooching grace, so casual you half expect to look down and notice he’s wearing flip-flops.This is how good he is: Madrid don’t want him to replace Dani Carvajal, or not completely. They want him to replace Toni Kroos too, to restore some of his range of passing. MeanwhileAlexander‑Arnold wants to win a Ballon d’Or. Good luck with both of those. Time will be short. The noises off are unforgiving. And Madrid have to win.So much for the departed. This is above all a moment for the team that remains, and in essence the real end of the Klopp era. To date Slot has been able to show only his best side, repurposing inherited parts, adding new gears and altering the tempo, always sure-footed in public, striding his touchline looking like the owner of a successful chain of provincial bakers here to receive a regional business award from the Duchess of Sandwich.It is still best to see the new era as a hybrid to this point, an extended Viking funeral for the age of Klopp. This has been a high-grade first fix, but Liverpool have looked tired as the season has narrowed, and in a way that feels like more than just a physical thing. This is a side reaching their tipping point. And this summer could yet bring a genuine tectonic shift.View image in fullscreenVirgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah could also end up leaving Liverpool this summer.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesAlexander-Arnold may or may not be followed by Mohamed Salah and/or Virgil van Dijk. But those two will 33 and 34 years old by the start of next season. For all the hopeful talk about science and conditioning, nobody outruns the clock. The influence of both will necessarily diminish from this point. In the process Liverpool are close to losing not just their three best players but their three best players by a mile and the defining architecture of an era.It will be incredibly hard to navigate this. The game is never about individuals. Except sometimes when it actually is. For the past seven years Liverpool have basically lost two or three games a season when all three of these players start. Even when they have a bad day Liverpool can always lean on their right side, or the cold still centre in defence. And while Slot has been rightly praised for his excellent choices, it does help to have a fearless dead-eye super-ripped machine-genius finisher in the team who just keeps validating every single one of them by scoring the winning goal.From Sels to Salah: a Premier League best XI of the season so farRead moreAgain, uncertainty and departures also present an opportunity. Alexander-Arnold in particular is a handy star player to lose, if only because he is so unusual in his style and impact that there is no real idea of replacing him directly. This is a good thing. It leaves room for different strengths and patterns, a way of playing that Slot himself can wholeheartedly engineer. At the same time, every end-of-contract exit removes the need for Slot to manage that change himself, to placate or defenestrate basking stars. Not leaving can also be a problem. May we direct the jury at this point to exhibit A: the wasteland previously known as football overlords Manchester United. Every major departure also brings with it a note of freedom, all the more so for Slot, with a league title all but under his belt.For all the serene progress to this point, this team don’t really look finished. Is the midfield really settled? Is Salah-dependence, the sheer weight of his goals and assists, really a long-term recipe for success? Either way it seems clear this will not become another Souness-style nightmare, an act of precision rebalancing carried out with all the delicacy of a man repointing a gingerbread house with a sledgehammer.But the rebuild was always waiting. And while Alexander‑Arnold may not have left an envelope of cash on the mantelpiece to help that process he is at least speeding it along, giving information, flagging the task to come.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolTrent Alexander-ArnoldArne SlotcommentShareReuse this content"

Sign up now!Daniel HarrisWed 26 Mar 2025 11.15 EDTLast modified on Wed 26 Mar 2025 11.46 EDTShareSELEC-OUCH!There is no name in football more evocative than that of Braseew, its mere mention conjuring images ofbrawls,backyard misadventuresandjogo bonito(sponsored by Nike). Even José Mourinho, at his mostdavkanikjoyless, was moved to note that “a team without a Brazilian isn’t a team” – though given he said that after signing Fred,still missing crucial penalties for him almost a decade later, perhaps it was part of some dastardly plan of pathological, exhibition self-sabotage.But we digress. Given the richness of Brazilian football heritage — an arena in which Mourinho is, of course, the leading expert — it was no shock to wake this morning and discover that the Selecão had been involved in a five-goal thriller overnight. It was, though, somewhat surprising to learn that they were on the wrong end of a4-1 humiliationby arch rivals, Argentina. In the process, the defending champions cemented their spot in the next competition, the resounding result achieved with the electrifying pace of Enzo Fernández in attack, a central-defensive partnership of Nicolás Otamendi, who retired at least a decade ago, and Cristian Romero, for whom the experience was so relaxing he even avoided his usual booking for endearingly wild GBH.And it wasn’t even as though Brazil – who managed to win a World Cup with Dunga, Zinho and Mazinho, then again with Roqué Junior, Gilberto and Kléberson, yet fail to win one with Zico, Falcão and Sócrates – are in a fallow period. In their starting XI were Joelinton ­– like Fernandinho before him, mysteriously exempt from the laws governing foul play; Marquinhos; Raphinha; Rodrygo; and Vinicius Jr, suddenly less loquacious about which awards he’s pre-emptively awarded himself. In the event, though, it was Matheus Cunha who scored their consolation goal – just as he did when Wolves lost 6-2 to Chelsea, 5-3 to Brentford, 2-1 to Ipswich and so on. Which is to say that yes, the Daily is tacitly comparing that lot to Matt Doherty, Nelson Semedo and Toti Gomes, and strongly implying that Mourinho was wrong: a team with 11 Brazilians still isn’t a team.Of course, Brazil will still – no, notthatWill Still – qualify for the 2026 jamboree, along with most of South America. They now sit fourth in the 10-team group, with six nations moving on by right and one given the chance to progress via playoff – or, in other words, it really does take 45 games to eliminate three teams out of 10. So perhaps, to facetiously connect two unconnected things one last time, it’s not just Mourinho with some dastardly plan of pathological, exhibition self-sabotage, but the World Cup itself.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Sarah Rendell at 8pm GMT for live updates on Arsenal 3-0 Real Madrid (3-2 agg) in their Women’s Big Cup quarter-final second leg.QUOTE OF THE DAYIn the end, there was more repercussion for everything that happened than Spain winning the World Cup.

What did she do next?The Dutch rider was narrowly beaten in her bid to retain her title. But she has stormed back at the start of this season using lessons from her childhoodAndy CochraneWed 26 Mar 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 26 Mar 2025 05.02 EDTShareEarlier this month, on the final climb of the Strade Bianche, Demi Vollering flew past Anna van der Breggen, her former coach and renewed rival,handily winning by 18 seconds. As the first spring classic of the year, the Italian race is renowned for its white gravel roads and regarded as a barometer of early season fitness. Vollering, already one of her sport’s best riders, showed she was capable of an even higher level.“The whole team was motivated, so I wanted to win for them,” says Vollering, “but I didn’t feel a lot of pressure before the race, because everything is new with the team.”After losing the 2024 Tour de France Femmesby just four seconds, the smallest margin ever, Vollering switched teams and signed with FDJ-SUEZ in the offseason. Despite four successful years with SD Worx, during which she won the Tour de France, La Vuelta Femenina, and the overall UCI Title, the Dutch rider knew a fresh start was necessary to return to the top of the podium. Early results are optimistic, with adominant win at Setmana Ciclista Valencianafollowed by the decisive victory at Strade Bianche.“It’s the start of a new journey,” says Vollering, downplaying her results while excited for the new energy. “We’re just figuring it out as a team. I’m focused on getting everyone involved, getting everyone to their top level. It changes a lot when the team is riding for a win together and everyone wants to be a part of it.”Close finish can fire Tour de France Femmes to greater heightsRead moreWhile Vollering’s biggest goal is reclaiming the Tour de France crownshe won in 2023, she knows doing so will require helping everyone on the team get stronger. “Our goal for the early races is to learn how to work together. Our preseason training camps were focused on team efforts and getting to know each other. We know this will benefit us later on, so I don’t feel too much pressure in races right now.”FDJ-SUEZ plans to use the spring to practice teamwork and positioning, which will be implemented in the Tour. Vollering says this has helped her on a individual level.“I’ve always lived by, ‘it all starts with dreaming,’” she says. In high school, it helped Vollering believe becoming a pro athlete was possible. Later on, while working in her father’s flower shop, it helped her keep the idea of being in a professional peloton alive, even when doubts crept in. “Without female riders to look up to, the dream would almost disappear at times, but I’m happy I kept searching for it.”Now at the sharpest end of the sport, Vollering continues to push the envelope. “Big dreams help me stay in the process. When I’m having hard times, a clear vision keeps me going,” she says. “When nothing is working out, I keep fighting. I dared to dream of the biggest results and because of that they came. That’s the message I want to give the world.”Dreams, she admits, don’t always come true. Despite winning La Vuelta, Tour de Suisse, and two stages of the Tour last season, she failed in her ultimate goal at the Tour de Fance by the finest of margins. “It was part of the process, a year I needed to go through. It was a really big lesson for me. Losing showed me how much I love this sport,” she says. “Some parts of last year I want to forget, but it gives me a lot of motivation to work harder.”View image in fullscreenDemi Vollering won a thrilling finish to the Strade Bianche.Photograph: Dario Belingheri/Getty ImagesFDJ-SUEZ enter the season with an entirely different mindset than her last squad, something that originates from the team’s humble beginnings. “Everyone is respectful and calm. Everything feels really natural,” she says. “They weren’t always successful and they’ve worked really hard for where they are, which keeps them grounded and down to earth. We have big dreams that help us feel united for the season.”In the offseason, Vollering also switched coaches and added new mental exercises, like solving puzzles to test her brain when her body is stressed to the max. Still, for the most part, her program is similar to last year, including yoga practice at the start of every day.Consistency is part of every elite athlete’s strategy, including Vollering, whose early lessons came from her father. “He would say, ‘every human is just flesh and blood. If you realize it, you’ll be a step ahead.’ Which just means you just have to work hard. My dad will die in the greenhouses, because it is his passion. From a young age I saw how important it was to find your passion and work for it.”Vollering’s mother taught her to always look inwards before judging anyone else. “This made my sisters and me people pleasers, but also taught us to observe people and see what they need,” she says. “I often blame myself first, but this pushes me to be at the top of my game, which you have to do at the top of the sport.”When Vollering was just two years old, her grandmother found a kids bike at a secondhand market and gave it to her. “I was lucky to get it. That began a love of bikes that has never left,” she says. “I have so many memories on a bike, playing with other kids on the streets, riding laps on a BMX track for a whole day, and riding on vacation. We even made a little cyclocross track in the back garden.”In the summers, Vollering’s parents would take her and her sisters camping, an experience that proved formative. “We would take a caravan or trailer around the Netherlands or Belgium and go camping. It was so much fun sleeping outdoors with my cousins,” she says. “Something about moving in the fresh air is freeing. I let go of everything and go back to feeling like a kid again, which is the goal of being an adult.”View image in fullscreenDemi Vollering in the yellow jersey during last year’s Tour de France.Photograph: Hollandse Hoogte/REX/ShutterstockLast year, Vollering signed a deal with Nike, making her one of the most recognized faces in women’s cycling. That recognition means Vollering’s voice carries more weight. Last season when she spoke up about the lack of TV coverage for women’s cycling, criticizing broadcasters prioritizing the early stages of the men’s Vuelta over the queen stage of the women’s Tour, itspawned an industry-wide discussionon equity, ultimately driving more interest towards women’s cycling.“Live broadcasts are very important, not just the last 30 minutes of races, which are often over by then,” Vollering says. “Broadcasting from the beginning shows how important positioning is and how teams work together. With more live broadcasting, we’re starting to see more money and sponsors coming into the sport. It’s changing, but still has a long way to go.”Vollering hopes the growth in women’s cycling continues. “The next step for us is a Under-23 category. That would create a stepping stone for girls coming into the sport who don’t have the top level yet. It would give them a place to grow, get the bike skills, and learn what type of rider they are.”The U23 category would probably create a cleaner development process and a deeper field on the highest level, driving more interest in the sport as a whole. However, to create a new category would require even more girls getting into the sport, which was one of the big reasons Vollering wanted to partner with Nike.“Girls are often pulled away from their dreams because of expectations from people around them,” says Vollering. “I want to give them a role model to look up to. I want to do what Sernea Williams did for tennis. She’s much more than a tennis player. Everyone knows her. She transcended the sport and showed so many young girls that they could dream bigger.”Explore more on these topicsCyclingTour de France FemmesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Tsunoda would join Max Verstappen for his home grand prix in Japan next week, with Lawson likely returning to the Racing Bulls feeder team.Lawson was promoted from Racing Bulls to replace Mexican driver Sergio Pérez but has struggled in his first two race weekends in Australia and China.

While Verstappen is second in the 2025 standings, eight points behind McLaren’s Lando Norris, Lawson has failed to score a point in Melbourne or Shanghai.Japan’s Tsunoda has made a stronger start and scored three points when he finished sixth in the Shanghai sprint last Saturday.

Arsenal had been here before, overturning a 1-0 defeat by Bayern Munich to reach the semi-finals last season, but the mountain was that bit bigger, Athenea del Castillo adding to Linda Caicedo’s strike in the 82nd minute of the first leg to heap pressure on the showdown in north London.There could be no excuses on the carpet-like surface for which their game is built, the torrential rain and torn-up pitch at the Estadio Alfredo Di Stefáno providing some forgiving context to the 2-0 defeat in Spain.This was at Arsenal’s home, though, in front of more than 20,000 fans who anxiously urged their team forward again and again as they sought to reduce the deficit early on. The home team were dominant, accruing more than 65% of possession in the first half and 26 touches in the opposition box to Madrid’s three.For all that, though, the final ball was poor, one shot on target before the interval a damning statistic. Maëlle Lakrar did well to deny Alessia Russo after a wonderful flick from Katie McCabe was met by the England forward and an unmarked Mariona Caldentey sent a header off the bar from the resulting corner. Caitlin Foord struggled to connect cleanly with a Russo ball and landed heavily, and cross after cross from Kelly was wasted.In the 41st minute there was a huge let‑off for the Gunners, Daphne van Domselaar’s double save keeping them in it. That was the final meaningful action of the first half and, with time ticking away from the hosts, hope started to seep from the crowd.Madrid were well organised, having made just one enforced change to the team that won in Spain, with Melanie Leupolz absent through injury, and confidence was high following a first defeat of the La Liga champions Barcelona on Sunday. They absorbed the Arsenal pressure relatively comfortably.View image in fullscreenMariona Caldentey celebrates scoring Arsenal’s second goal.Photograph: Ashley Western/Colorsport/ShutterstockThere was no time to waste but the blueprint had been there in the first half. It took one minute for Arsenal to do what they had not been able to do for 45 minutes: capitalise on Kelly’s crosses.Russo turned in from her England teammate straight after the restart and three minutes later the tie was level via the same source – this time Caldentey’s head was there to meet Kelly’s ball and direct it coolly past Misa Rodríguez.Just before the hour Arsenal had the lead in the tie for the first time when McCabe’s free-kick was nodded down by Steph Catley and swept in by Russo. The turnaround was remarkable and deserved and the Emirates Stadium crowd delighted in every touch, turn and pass.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The semi-final against Montemurro’s Lyon awaits, with the French giants having secured a 6-1 aggregate win against Bayern Munich. Those fixtures will be played over the last two weekends in April.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueArsenal WomenReal Madrid WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Two separate sources at tier-four clubs praised the extensiveness of the consultation.An email sent to lower-league clubs on Wednesday and seen by the Guardian, said: “The consultation period was an opportunity for us to listen to and understand the views of the wider game. Therefore, given what we have heard, it is recognised that more work is required to find the right solution to the challenges, and the current proposals will not be moving forward at this time.”The plans would have also led to the divisions in tiers three and four of the pyramid increasing from 12 to 14 teams per division. There would have been changes to the promotion rules too, with three rather than two teams relegated to tier four from each of the tier-three divisions. The four league winners in tier four would be promoted and the runners-up would have entered playoffs to determine two new promotion spots. Additionally, there would have been a vast expansion of tier six, which has 16 divisions and that could have risen to as many as 24 regional leagues with 10 teams per league, if the plans had gone ahead.Instead, the existing one-up, one‑down structure will remain in place across those leagues. But it is understood there remains a commitment from the FA to continue ­reviewing the options for how the leagues should look in the future.One of the key reasons the proposals were drawn up in the first place was that the governing body had sought to find ways to enhance the amount of meaningful, competitive matches that 16- to-19-year-old players were receiving, amid widespread concerns at lots of clubs about the state of the reserve and academy leagues. Discussions about different ways to resolve this issue will continue, but the earliest any future changes could come in would now have to be the summer of 2027.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On the biggest stage in European football, the Champions League, the Brazilian produced the performance of her City career so far to help set up a2-0 quarter-final first leg win against Chelsea.Kerolin was a constant thorn in Chelsea’s side throughout the game and provided the assist for one of Vivianne Miedema’s two goals to set up a tantalising scoreline before the return leg at Stamford Bridge on Thursday.“I’m really happy,” the 25-year-old says. “The team played well and we were all having a good day, so that made it much easier for me to feel light and calm for a special night in the Champions League”. One assist in a Champions League quarter-final was never, however, going to be enough for the fiercely competitive and ambitious forward, and she followed that up by scoring against Chelsea in City’s2-1 Women’s Super League defeatagainst the reigning champions.After three years in North Carolina, Kerolin felt she needed a new challenge. “I have this big dream of being the best player in the world and of becoming a world champion,” she says. “I knew being in Europe could help me get more visibility globally because all the players who win the Fifa The Best awards are either in England or Spain. I think life is meant for dreaming so I moved here with the purpose of challenging myself.”Kerolin goes on to describe her move to City as a way to keep her on her toes. “Playing against and with players who challenge me every day in training means that if you don’t work hard and don’t stay focused, you won’t play,” she says. “The players at City are very good.”View image in fullscreenKerolin Nicoli in action against Chelsea in the league.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAKerolin’s past two years have been full of ups and downs. She went from being the 2023 National Women’s Soccer League most valuable player to sustaining a season-ending anterior cruciate ligament tear immediately after the Women’s World Cup. She then returned to the Brazil national team in time to grab silver at the 2024 Olympics. At the end of that year, she also had a decision to make.“I was uncertain about whether I should stay another year in the US, if I wanted to play there for one more year after my ACL injury before moving back to Europe,” Kerolin, who played for Madrid CFF in 2021, says.“City was a team whose style of play really surprised me. It is also interesting that their style of play is very similar to the way my club in the US played. Our coach there really liked the way City played, so he kind of mirrored that. This, in a way, has made the adaptation process a little easier.”Settling in at City has been more straightforward on the pitch than off it, Kerolin admits with a smile, with the weather in the north of England something she has very much had to get used to. “It really got to me in the beginning,” she says. “When I was called up for training in Brazil I wanted to set off fireworks. I said, ‘I need some sun!’.“I actually thought I was prepared because I was in the US and it’s also cold there, right? But it’s nothing compared to Manchester. It’s very cold here [for me]. But I came here with a purpose so that is just another obstacle I have to go through to reach my goal.”A lot has happened since Kerolin arrived in England. City have fallen 15 points behind Chelsea in the WSL after losing to their rivals on Sunday. Prior to that the manager, Gareth Taylor, had also beenreplaced by Nick Cushing, while one of her teammates, Khadija Shaw, wassubjected to horrific racial abuseafter a game against Arsenal.Kerolin has been the subject of similar abuse and says she tried to support Shaw as best as she could even though they had not had much time as teammates together. “It really affected me, especially when I was with the Brazilian national team,” she says. “After a while I realised that the people who criticised and insulted me didn’t know what I was going through. They would be the same ones who later wanted to praise me and say good things. So I decided that [what they said] was irrelevant. The most important thing is for the coach, us, and our team to know how we really are. You can’t be 100% perfect every day, so after I understood that, it became easier.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Khadija didn’t play the next game [and it was important for her to decide]. The main thing was how she was feeling, her recovery and making sure that she felt OK. This was a good example of how clubs should protect players and not just think about results. The wellbeing of the players is more important.”Brazil will host the next Women’s World Cup in 2027 and Kerolin is desperate for her country to have a successful tournament, on and off the pitch. “Brazilian football is about talent,” she says. “It’s football from the outside, street football. Every time people ask me about Brazil, they want to know about the carnival, the parties and things like that. But going to Brazil and getting to know our culture will give them a different perspective. Brazil is talented and not only that, the food is amazing – I’ve been everywhere and it’s hard to beat.“I think that, when other players have been to Brazil for the World Cup, they will look at us differently, understanding our culture, and respecting the country in a new way.”Get in touchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailmoving.goalposts@theguardian.comThis is an extract from our free weekly email, Moving the Goalposts.

British fans cannot use the site or others like it because it is illegal to resell footballtickets in this way in the UK. The Premier League lists Vivid Seats as an “unauthorised ticket website”.Boehly reveals Chelsea owners likely to split if they disagree over stadium planRead moreThe issue has been atopic of much discussion among Chelsea fans, with many on social media complaining it has become impossible for members to buy tickets to home and away games. There were already concerns within the fanbase about ticket touting, leading the Chelsea Supporters’ Trust to conduct a survey of its members about the issue. The CST found that only 17% of supporters had confidence in the club to tackle touting and anger was expressed at Vivid Seats’ connection with Boehly, who became Chelsea’s co-owner and chairman in 2022. Vivid Seats charges 10% commission, plus a service fee.Chelseahave previously denounced ticket holders who sell on their seats for profit.In the open letter to Masters, the CST said it had “received a significant amount of correspondence from concerned members” as well as the widerChelseafanbase over the reports of Boehly’s connection with Vivid Seats. A CST spokesperson said: “Vivid Seats continues to list Premier League tickets for above face value at significantly inflated rates and our members have continued to indicate that Mr Boehly’s connection with Vivid Seats is a breach of trust and a clear conflict of interest.“Not only does this undermine the efforts of Chelsea FC, the Premier League, and the Metropolitan Police to combat ticket touting, but Vivid Seats contravenes the Chelsea FC ticketing policy, and is explicitly named by the Premier League as a known unauthorised ticket website.“We believe that now is the time for the Premier League to act swiftly and ensure that a major shareowner of a Premier League club ceases facilitating the sale of tickets for significantly above face value.”The Football Supporters’ Association backed the CST’s calls for the issue to be addressed. An FSA spokesperson said: “It is crystal clear that the Premier League needs to take action. Clubs, supporters’ groups, the police and the Premier League itself has worked hard in recent years to combat ticket touting – there is no excuse for a club owner to be involved in such activity.”Tickets listed on the Vivid Seats website for Chelsea’s final home Premier League match of the season on 18 May, against Manchester United, range from £442 for general admission to more than £3,000 for hospitality in the Harris Suite at Stamford Bridge.Chelsea declined to comment when contacted by PA Media.

Instead, as his teammates took to the practice field on Wednesday morning, Raphinha, scorer of 27 goals and provider of 20 assists this season, was still somewhere over the Atlantic.The same was true of the defender Ronald Araújo, with the Barcelona coach, Hansi Flick, confirming that neither of them will play as La Liga restarts – 44 hours after Brazil kicked off against Argentina in a World Cup qualifier more than 10,000 miles away.Brazil humiliated by Argentina as bitter rivals book place at 2026 World CupRead moreTheOsasunamidfielder Enzo Boyomo may play, at least that was the hope Barcelona’s opponents hold on to, but with a day to go his manager did not know where exactly he was either, let alone what shape he was in. “We have to see if he makes it first,” Vicente Moreno said. The Cameroon international had embarked on a journey from Yaoundé to Istanbul to Madrid to Barcelona.Araújo’s plan had initially been to travel from La Paz, where Uruguay took on Bolivia, and pick up Raphinha and other Brazilian and Argentinian La Liga players in Buenos Aires, stopping in Madrid en route to Barcelona. They were not due to arrive in Catalonia until Wednesday evening.“They are not going to play,” Flick said. “The flight is long, it’s not the ideal situation. They have to train, recover, rest. We will see about Sunday [when Barcelona play again].”Brazil-Argentina had kicked off at 1am Wednesday Spain time; Barcelona-Osasuna begins at 9pm on Thursday. “If we could have chosen another date, we would have done,” Moreno said speaking for both clubs. By then, though, nothing could be done.Barcelona and Osasuna had originally been scheduled to face each other a fortnight ago, but the game was postponed at the last minute afterthe death of Barcelona’s club doctor Carles Minarroin the team hotel in the hours before the game. Rescheduling was not easy: Barcelona are in the Copa del Rey semi-final and the Champions League quarter-finals. Elimination from either competition would open options but, if not, the only date available was three days before the final game of the league season.View image in fullscreenBarcelona train before their rescheduled match with Osasuna.Photograph: Javier Borrego/AFP7/ShutterstockWhen 27 March was first proposed the clubs objected. According to the fixture list, that would mean Osasuna playing Barcelona on Thursday and Athletic Bilbao on Friday. It would also mean the teams missing some internationals and playing others that had not had a rest between the international break and club fixtures restarting.Robert Lewandowski trained on Wednesday for the first time after representing Poland. Spanish, Dutch and French players had played extra time in their midweek internationals. Flick suggested that going straight to penalties was “something we could think about”.The Spanish federation unilaterally decided the game would go ahead on Thursday, with Osasuna’s game against Athletic moved back two days. Barcelona do not now have the stipulated 72 hours between their next two league games – a week after Carlo Ancelotti had threatened that if that happened to Real Madrid again they would refuse to turn up.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is not about Barcelona, it is about protecting players. But I can’t change anything. We are going to play.“I don’t want to talk about it much; we have to accept it. They said you have to play and so we play. Maybe Uefa and Fifa need to say its necessary for [players to have] two or three days rest after the international break. I don’t want to tell you what my reaction was when I found out.“We had decided that the players would have two days rest after the international break and we have had to change that. It’s not the best situation but they’re very professional and they are in good shape. The team is fantastic, what I saw today [in training] is a very good situation.“We are confident and we have to fight, and winning tomorrow would be the best reaction we can have. I had a meeting with the rest of my staff, the physios, the fitness coaches about what we can do and they said: ‘You know, coach? The players are good, they’re fit, they can play every three days.’”Explore more on these topicsBarcelonaOsasunanewsShareReuse this content"

The Internazionale marksman has, however, been a more effective performer for his national team.As Son and his teammates huffed and puffed to a 1-1 draw with Jordan on Tuesday –a third successive stalemate in an easier World Cup qualifying group – Taremi scored twice in a 2-2 draw with Uzbekistan tosecure a fourth successive World qualification for his nation.Brazil humiliated by Argentina as bitter rivals book place at 2026 World CupRead moreNeeding a point against Uzbekistan in Tehran to qualify, the hosts were a goal down when Taremi shrugged off recent injury issues to fire home a spectacular volley from the edge of the area. His second goal, arriving with eight minutes remaining after Uzbekistan had retaken the lead, was less spectacular and instead showcased the 32-year-old’s goal-poaching abilities just as much, as he reactedquickest to strike from close range.That was goal No 54 for Taremi for Iran, taking him to half of Ali Daei’s international tally. While Taremi is not going to challenge the legendary Iran striker in terms of goals scored, he can do something more precious: lead his country to the knockout stages of a World Cup.Taremi’s partnership with Sardar Azmoun has been fruitful, even if the former Bayer Leverkusen and Roma striker surprised many last summer by giving up life in Germany to return to the Middle East with Dubai’s Shabab Al-Ahli, reportedly so he can be closer to his stable of horses. Both of these particular Iranian thoroughbreds have also been linked to Premier League clubs in the recent past, including Manchester United and Arsenal. Iran’s defence is not quite as strong, as evident in the soft goals given away to Uzbekistan.View image in fullscreenMehdi Taremi strikes his second goal against Uzbekistan, his 54th for Iran.Photograph: Vahid Salemi/APIran were always going to qualify but to be undefeated in 14 games is credit to their head coach, Amir Ghalenoei. The 61-year-old was appointed in 2023 to succeed Carlos Queiroz after the last World Cup, when Iran came close to getting out of the group stage for the first time before falling just short. The appointment was seen as being an underwhelming choice, and not just because Ghalenoei’s first spell in charge almost 20 years ago did not go well. Many feel that as well as producing turgid football, Ghalenoei doesn’t have the tactical or motivational skills to take the team to the knockout stages. Indeed, there are rumours that Taremi would like a change.The striker is not just Iran’s talisman and captain but also has friends in high places. He publicly fell out with Dragan Skocic, the man who led Iran to qualification for the 2022 World Cup before being replaced by Queiroz only weeks before the squad travelled to Qatar. It would not be a surprise if something similar happened to Ghaleneoi.Taremi is not afraid to speak out publicly. During last week’s win over the United Arab Emirates, also at the same Azadi Stadium, the floodlights failed (the 29 minutes of added time was a new international record, breaking the existing one of 24 minutes whenIran lost 6-2 to England at the last World Cup, when Taremi scored both of the defeated team’s goals). Afterwards he publicly asked where the millions that had been promised to renovate the iconic but ageing arena had gone.It is not just the facilities that are getting old. Only two of Iran’s starting XI against Uzbekistan were under 30 and the average age of the team was over 31. Ghalenoei – or his replacement – has much to do in terms of refreshing the squad.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Iran’s relative isolation has long meant that the country struggles to arrange top-class tests, especially in Tehran. The friendly list since the last World Cup has games against Russia, Kenya, Bulgaria, Angola, Jordan and Qatar. In the past, sanctions also make it tricky for the Iranian FA to get its hands on money owned from international sporting organisations such as Fifa and the Asian Football Confederation to pay for overseas training camps.View image in fullscreenAmir Ghalenoei may not make it to the World Cup as Iran’s head coach.Photograph: Majid Asgaripour/ReutersFor 2026, there is another potential problem. It is expected that Donald Trump will soon announce a full travel ban on 10 countries, a list that is sure to include Iran. How this will work for fans hoping to make the trip to the United States next summer – not to mention the players and staff – remains to be seen.Distractions are a part of life for Iranian footballers. If there was the same environment as, say, Japan in terms of facilities, atmosphere, and investment, then the natural talent that comes out of the country would make it a genuine force. As it is, an ageing team is going to need Taremi to be at his absolute best in North America next year.Explore more on these topicsIranWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The left-back went off injured while playing inCanada’s 2-1 win over the United Statesin the Concacaf Nations League third place game.The news comes as a blow to Bayern and toCanada, who were hoping to have Davies available heading into a busy summer with the Club World Cup and preparations for next year’s World Cup.With a charged win over US, Canada proved they’re a complete squadRead moreDavies’s agent, Nedal Huoseh, issued a statement on Wednesday blaming the Canadian federation for the injury, claiming that his client was not supposed to play in the third-place game but was convinced to by head coach Jesse Marsch.“Alphonso was not 100% after the Mexico game and it was planned that he was not going to start against the USA,” Huoseh’s statement read in part. “As a captain I feel he was pressured to start the game by the coach. Alphonso is not the kind of guy to say no in those moments. He ended up playing and look what happened. Canada Soccer needs to do a better job managing these players, in my opinion.”Canada Soccer has yet to publicly respond to Huoseh’s statement.The Davies blow was just one part of a bad international week for Bayern, as center-back Dayot Upamecano will also miss time due to injury. Bayern predicted Upamecano will be out for “several weeks” with a problem in his left knee after his return from playing both legs of France’s quarter-final win over Croatia in the UefaNations League.“In international breaks there is unfortunately always a danger that players come back injured, and this time it has hit us especially hard,” Bayern’s board member for sport Max Eberl said. “The absences of Alphonso Davies and Dayot Upamecano weigh heavily on FC Bayern.”Eberl said the team would “pull even closer together now” to make up for losing Davies and Upamecano. “The quality is there to keep on pursuing our big goals,” Eberl said.The injuries could mean Bayern rely more on central defender Kim Min-jae, who returned to training Monday after an achilles tendon injury forced him to miss international games for South Korea. It could also mean more game time for Bayern’s fringe players like center back Eric Dier, left-back Raphael Guerreiro and versatile defender Hiroki Ito.Bayern next play St Pauli in the Bundesliga on Saturday and face Internazionale in the quarter-finals of the Champions League next month.Explore more on these topicsBayern MunichCanadaNations LeagueUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Boothroyd also managed Watford and Coventry before succeeding Gareth Southgate as Under-21s manager in 2016, spending five years in the role.On the League Managers Association’s website on Wednesday, the 54-year-old said: “Three years ago, I was diagnosed with Parkinson’s. The news came as a massive shock to me, following what I expected to be my routine LMA Annual Health Assessment.“It has taken me time to feel ready to share my diagnosis and I have found it difficult not being completely open with people. My passion and love for coaching is as strong as ever, I am focusing on keeping physically fit, which is key to slowing down the progression of Parkinson’s.

Physically, it’s been easier,” he said. “I’m coping well with that because I’m a former footballer who’s worked on the grass every day as a coach, as a manager so that’s easy getting up and being disciplined to go for a run or do some exercise, because exercise is the key thing in staving off this condition. It’s been tough, but now I feel a lot more able to come out and talk about these things.”“It is a bit like my life’s been on hold for all of us for my family, for my kids and people have just wanted to be helpful and that’s great. I don’t want to wallow, don’t want pity, all I want is to get back on the pitch or whatever it is I end up doing.“I won’t let this define me, I’ll continue, I’ll keep fit, I’ll do what I’ve got to do in the gym and hopefully I can get a job with a purpose.”After leaving his England role following the team’s exit from the European Under-21 Championship, Boothroyd had a short spell as part of the Northern Ireland coaching staff in May 2022.Explore more on these topicsFootballWatfordEngland Under-21snewsShareReuse this content"

Farrell also said he will not pick players simply to satisfy quotas despite fears the Wales squad could be completely overlooked.On unveiling his coaching staff for the 10-game tour, Farrell revealed he and his assistants have compiled a longlist of about 75 players that includes Courtney Lawes, who is impressing for Brive in the French second division, and is likely to ­feature a number of others, includingOwen Farrell. The Toulouse duo of Jack Willis and Blair Kinghorn with Kyle Sinckler, David Ribbans and Ben White, all of whom are based at ­Toulon, are also possibilities.Andy Farrell’s awkwardness over whether to choose Owen for Lions speaks volumes | Gerard MeagherRead moreOwen Farrell has endured a ­difficult season with a struggling Racing 92 side and has not played for England since the2023 World Cup bronze-medal match. He has been sidelined of late with a groin injury but appeared off the bench last Saturday as Racing pulled off an impressive victory at Clermont.Andy Farrell will name his squad, of about 37 players, on 8 May, but with the Top 14 final scheduled for 28 June, France-based ­players could have to join the tour late and miss the curtain-raiser against ­Argentina in Dublin as well as the first match in Australia. Farrell said the Lions could enter talks with clubs such as ­Toulouse in a bid to secure players’ early release, though the Top 14 clubs would probably expect compensation.“We’re open-minded about all of that,” he said. “As we start to ­whittle it down the dynamics become a ­little bit different, but we don’t know if we’re going to have sufficient ­players in certain ­positions where we’re able to get on a plane and ­somebody could join us for game three.

He’s just coming back from injury.

The vote will take place after a hybrid meeting, with some expected to attend online.Beaumont, who wasparachuted into the RFU on a temporary basisafter Tom Ilube resigned in December, and the rest of the board have backed Sweeney throughout. With such a large electorate and the turnout uncertain, the outcome of the RFU’s first SGM for 25 years is impossible to predict.Sweeney has made it clear he will not resign and he is unlikely to be sacked immediately even if he suffers a humiliating defeat. In that event, the RFU would call an emergency board meeting for Friday to decide on their next steps.The SGM will be opened by the RFU president, Rob Udwin, before the motion is introduced by Paddy McAlpine, chair of Chichester RFC and one of four co-chairs of WGU, a rebel alliance of clubs from the Championship down to grassroots leagues.View image in fullscreenBill Beaumont (left) took over as interim RFU chair after Tom Ilube quit after the row about Bill Sweeney’s pay.Composite: GettyA counter resolution from the RFU board has also been tabled seeking members’ approval of “the acceleration” of a review of governance and representation that was started last May by Malcolm Wharton, a former member of the RFU council and RFU board. The governance review will recommend devolving more decision-making to local and regional bodies to counter accusations of the SGM simply ratifying the status quo.“The first motion arose because a number of members clearly felt frustrated by the challenges they are seeing around the game and because they believed that forcing our CEO out would help change that,” Beaumont said. “While I do not doubt their concern, a vote of no confidence in our CEO will not change this for the better.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Voting against the first motion this Thursday will allow us to get on with this job and not spend months consumed by the rancour and disruption that this process has brought.”The WGU immediately responded by claiming that the RFU board are not suitable leaders for the sport. “The rancour and disruption to the game has only been caused by the intransigence of the executive and board and their unwillingness to listen to and hear the issues raised over several years by participants, member clubs and referees’ societies,” it said. “Despite offers to engage and work on a way forward, the board and senior executive have refused to do so, which illustrates their unsuitability to lead our game.“This vote for change is asking the board to remove our CEO through a managed process. Let’s not forget that our past chair did the right thing and resigned rather than waiting for a special general meeting or annual general meeting forcing him to go.“Regardless of the result, we have highlighted to the rugby world what is going on within the inner corridors of Twickenham and that is a big step forward with clubs engaging in how the future may look. No one wins today as the game has already lost so much after successive boards’ failure through lack of direction and poor leadership.”Explore more on these topicsRugby Football UnionRugby unionSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

After that decision, individuals connected to the athletes commissioned a legal opinion from Blackstone Chambers.The KC-led report produced by four barristers at Blackstone, says: “We believe that there are strong grounds to challenge the lawfulness of the decisions, as regards the Interpretation Panel’s jurisdiction to make them in the first place, the substantive outcome, and the procedure that the Interpretation Panel appears to have adopted.”Cambridge remain deeply aggrieved at Oxford’s conduct, particularly as they claim OUBC have not responded to any communication from them or the university throughout the saga. OUBC have not responded to requests for comment.With just over two weeks until the race Cambridge have no plans to act on the legal opinion at this stage as mounting a legal challenge would be time-consuming and potentially disruptive to the squad, but they are reserving all options for the future. The three students involved have reluctantly accepted their fate, prioritising the success of the squad over their own personal ambitions.The interpretation panel, which is chaired by the corporate finance lawyer Ian Hodgson and comprises representatives from each club, made its initial decision after Oxford’s complaint in December before overturning it when Cambridge appealed in January.After Cambridge named Heywood, Foxell and Crowley in their crews in February, Oxford challenged their selection again on the grounds that schedule 2 of the joint agreement between the clubs governing the race states that the interpretation panel’s decisions are “binding, final and unappealable”.View image in fullscreenCambridge are aggrieved at Oxford’s conduct, claiming OUBC has not responded to any communication from them.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAfter this submission, the panel reverted to its original decision, despite having previously accepted that it was flawed.The legal opinion from Blackstone outlines three areas in which the lawfulness of the panel’s decisions could be challenged relating to its jurisdiction, the substantive outcome and the procedures used. The interpretation panel is accused of failing to observe the timescales set out in the joint agreement so that individual competitors and their teams have clarity on any issues of eligibility well in advance of the race. As a result the three students were preparing for the race until December unaware of any problem only to be ruled out, then reinstated the following month before being finally banned six weeks before the race, all while continuing to train.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Both clubs have regularly selected PGCE students, with Julia Robey, now deputy head of sixth form at King’s college school, Wimbledon, racing for Oxford in 2017.Finally, the KC-led review asserts that the interpretation panel’s work is procedurally unfair. The students were not informed their involvement was being challenged, were not given any opportunity to represent themselves and have still not received any documentation regarding the decision.The decision to ban PGCE students has been described as “an insult to teachers” by Imogen Grant, the reigning Olympic lightweight double sculls champion, who won the women’s Boat Race with Cambridge in 2017, 2018 and 2022. There are also widespread concerns that women will be disproportionately affected, as according to a teacher training census conducted by gov.uk, 68% of PGCE entrants across all universities in 2024-25 are female.A PGCE is only required to teach in the state sector, with Heywood, Foxell and Crowley all working at state schools in Cambridgeshire in addition to their studies. “This is an insult to teachers everywhere and a desperate ploy from Oxford,” Grant said.“I don’t believe this reflects on the current Oxford squad, who have also had to train among this uncertainty all year. I believe this is entirely down to select individuals among the alumni who have a narrow, outdated view of who rows boat races.”Explore more on these topicsThe Boat RaceRowingUniversity of CambridgeUniversity of OxfordnewsShareReuse this content"

Her surprise lead places her in pole position heading into Friday’s free skate with a chance to become the first American women’s singles skater to win a world title since Kimmie Meissner in 2006.She edged out Japan’s Mone Chiba, who scored 73.44, and fellow American Isabeau Levito, the injury-hit reigning world silver medalist, who earned 73.33 for third place in her first competition since Skate America in October.‘Frozen in time’: figure skating world unites in grief and tribute at Boston world championshipsRead moreLiu was candid when asked how she managed to emerge as the leader. “I don’t know. It’s so strange. I really don’t know,” she said. “I would say it’s definitely my mentality. It’s hard to get in whatever state of mind I have, but I really like it. And everyone keeps telling me it seems to ‘work’ – I don’t know what that means, but I’ll just keep skating.”Her program featured a clean triple Lutz–triple toe loop combination, fast and centered spins and expressive choreography that earned her a standing ovation. She even threw in a spontaneous cartwheel during her introduction.“I was thinking of doing something cool,” she said. “I saw the space I had and thought, ‘A cartwheel will be it.’”Theremarkable comebackhas yielded richer dividends than many expected. Liu retired after earning bronze at the 2022 world championships, her final competition before stepping away. Early last year, she announced her return, with renewed motivation and long-term hopes of competing at the2026 Winter Olympics in Milano Cortina.“Doesn’t really change anything,” Liu said of leading after the short. “My goals are still the same. I want to put out a really good performance for my free skate. The ideal one – that would be a dream.”Her coaches, Phillip DiGuglielmo and Massimo Scali, met her at the boards with quiet smiles and a warm “welcome back”.Just behind Liu, Levito – last year’s world silver medalist from Mount Holly, New Jersey – looked strong in her own return after missing four months with a foot injury. Her Audrey Hepburn-themed short program to Henry Mancini’s Moon River was another crowd favorite.View image in fullscreenIsabeau Levito of the United States performs her Audrey Hepburn-themed short program on Wednesday afternoon at the world figure skating championships in Boston.Photograph: Joosep Martinson/International Skating Union/Getty Images“I had 1,000 thoughts from start to finish in that entire program,” said Levito, a former world junior champion who turned 19 this month. “At times I was thinking about something not even related to skating. I understand why I was nervous – I thought I would forget how to compete. But I’m so happy to be back.”The three-time defending world champion Kaori Sakamoto of Japan mixed in some uncharacteristic struggles and posted a 71.03 for fifth place. She landed a double flip instead of a triple on her opening combination – a rare error that may have cost her the chance of becoming the first skater to win four straight world titles since the American great Carol Heiss’s run of five on the trot from 1956 through 1960.‘If there was no one on Earth, I would still skate’: Alysa Liu on her remarkable figure skating comebackRead moreAmber Glenn, considered one of the favorites after an undefeated Grand Prix season, stumbled on her trademark triple Axel and fell to ninth place with 67.65. The 25-year-old from Plano, Texas, remains the only woman in this field to land the high-risk jump cleanly in competition this season.“I’m obviously very disappointed right now,” Glenn said. “It’s always hard to come back after a fall.”South Korea’s Kim Chae-yeon, last month’s Four Continents and Asian Winter Games champion, touched her hand to the ice on a shaky triple toe loop and finished 11th with 65.67. That will leave the 18-year-old with an uphill battle of matching her world bronze medal from a year ago in Montreal.Missing from the field once again was the Russian contingent, whose skaters remain barred from international competitions due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. Russian women had won five of the six world titles prior to the ban and their continued absence has reshaped the medal landscape, creating new opportunities for rising contenders from Japan, South Korea and the United States.View image in fullscreenKaori Sakamoto of Japan is bidding to become the first skater to win four straight world titles since Carol Heiss won five in a row from 1956 through 1960.Photograph: Joosep Martinson/International Skating Union/Getty ImagesThe competition opened Wednesday at midday under a cloud of grief and remembrance. Atribute was scheduled ahead of the evening sessionfor the 28 members of the skating community who died on 29 January, when an American Airlines flightcollided with a military helicopternear Washington. Among the 67 total victims were two skaters, two coaches and two parents from the host Skating Club of Boston.“The kids we lost – across the country – were the future of the sport,” said Doug Zeghibe, chief executive of the club. “So it’s really nice to see this being acknowledged.”Worlds continue Thursday with the pairs’ free skate and the start of the men’s and ice dance events. All medals will be doled out by Saturday night. This event also serves as a critical qualifier for the 2026 Winter Games, with Olympic quotas determined by national placements in each discipline.For Liu, that road to Milano Cortina has already begun. But first, she has a world title within reach. “I didn’t expect too much from this season,” she said. “But I know that next season will be even better.”That may be true. But right now Alysa Liu is leading the world – and skating like she never left.Explore more on these topicsFigure skatingUS sportsShareReuse this content"

But at the age of 16, shedecided to walk away. Two years later, she has reemerged with a fresh purpose in her sport, rising to new heights ahead of this year’s world figure skating championships, which get under way on Wednesday afternoon at Boston’s TD Garden.Why she leftThe opportunity to reflect about her purpose on the ice presented itself during the Covid-19 quarantines. When California’s ice rinks shut down, her usual training schedule halted.“That was my first ever break,” said Liu, who had skated mornings and afternoons seven days a week for years. “Once quarantine started, I was like, ‘Wow! This is what not skating is like.’ And I loved it so much.”To continue training amid a growth spurt and the pandemic, the then-15-year-old Liu moved to Delaware with her father. With limited in-person coaching lessons, she said she would lay on the ice and blast music, relishing the freedom to create structure for herself. The isolation gave her mind a sense of peace and curiosity.“That’s when I was thinking: what do I want out of this sport?,” Liu recalled. “I never really had time to stop and think for a moment. It was just me in the rink like that for a long time. I was really totally connected with myself.”Among the realizations: she missed her family.Liu grew up as the eldest of five children, with a sister and triplets a couple years younger, but she was the only one who skated. Her schedule took her away to the ice, back and forth from dorms to training centers and competitions around the world so much that everything in her memory remains a blur. She calculated that after the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, she would move away for college.“My worry was that I’ll have never lived with my family. I’m growing up so fast, so young. I knew that if I continued skating, I would never have a chance at home,” she said. This disconnect showed up in other ways: a purposefully missed flight to the Colorado Olympic training center, a panicked FaceTime to her old coach Phillip DiGuglielmo. She pushed through, hoping that the Olympics would be worth the sacrifice.In Beijing, Liu skated two clean programs and placed seventh on the day in the women’s competition, the highest among the Americans. Because of Covid-19 restrictions, foreign spectators were not allowed to watch. Although athletes were mostly restricted to the village, Liu embraced the experience and also found the little moments to enjoy, like practicing her Mandarin and taking advantage of the dim sum bar for breakfasts.View image in fullscreenLiu competes in the women’s singles free skate in the 2022 Winter Olympic Games at Beijing’s Capital Indoor Stadium on 17 February 2022. She finished in sixth place.Photograph: China News Service/Getty ImagesAfter finishing her competition season by winning a bronze medal at the 2022 world championships, at 16, Liu shocked the world when she posteda retirement announcement on Instagram, a decision she said she secretly reached months before and posted before anyone could stop her. She then temporarily disabled her social media.For almost two years, Liu explored who she was outside of skating. She took her first family vacation to Mexico and went on a Himalayan trek with friends and no internet in Nepal. She tried other sports like tennis, volleyball and basketball while hanging out and watching movies with her siblings. (She keeps a running list in her notes app of her favorite films, including Everything Everywhere all at Once, Children of the Sea, Spirited Away, and Bottoms.) But she still continued to stretch to maintain her mobility and flexibility. (One of her life goals is being able to do a cartwheel even when she is really old.) She did a smiley piercing on herself. She started school at UCLA in the fall of 2023.A ski trip with friends at Lake Tahoe inspired her to reevaluate her relationship to skating. Gliding down the hill at full speed, Liu realized that she wanted to get back on the ice again. With abundant knowledge and access to rinks and coaches, Liu felt that she would be a “hypocrite” if she said she loved skiing but did not love skating.“I love sports. I like moving. I also love music and I love dancing. That’s literally skating?” she laughed.While balancing her winter quarter classes at UCLA, Liu decided to add in a public ice session once a week at the Toyota Sports Performance Center in nearby El Segundo. She quickly discovered that she could still do the complex jumps she once did when she was younger. After months of wanting to distance herself from skating as her identity, she found herself drawn back time and time again to the ice as a hobby and source of expression.“If there’s days where you just want to be on the ice for fun when it’s not planned in your training schedules, I feel like that’s kind of when you know you still like it,” she said. And she still loved it. “I don’t really regret anything I’ve ever done, so even things I really hated doing, I wouldn’t change.”Guiding her own comebackWhen she was younger, Liu said her father mostly oversaw the decisions of firing and hiring of coaches, includingright before the 2022 Olympics. This time, she knew that she wanted to build her own team.In February 2024, she requested a call with her old coach, Phillip DiGuglielmo, who had seen her skate since she was five years old in Oakland. She also sought after Massimo Scali, a former Italian ice dancer and choreographer whom she remembered that she liked to work with.“They both understand my psyche, the psychology that I had then and now,” Liu said. “Compared to a lot of other skaters, I can be seen as really weird or crazy because I literally quit and came back. They would be uneasy with me.” Her goals were not related to any specific podium placements. “It’s just really great to have a team that understands you because a lot of people in skating misunderstand me.”When DiGuglielmo hopped on a FaceTime call with Liu, he spent two hours poking holes about her comeback logic. Why now? She had essentially done it all already. Was she ready for more hours of training? What about all the other reasons she had quit?View image in fullscreenLiu performs in the gala exhibition at the NHK Trophy at Yoyogi National Gymnasium on 10 November 2024, where she’d finished fourth overall in the third competition of her comeback.Photograph: Toru Hanai/International Skating Union/Getty ImagesThe hip problems that Liu had from repeatedly practicing triple and quad jumps had slowly gone away as her body had time to heal. She would focus on developing stronger muscles and stamina, no longer “cheating” with shortcuts during workouts. She knew she could also prioritize hanging out and sightseeing at competitions with friends and family. The food and body image issues she had developed, including comments from one coaching team that her at-home Chinese food diet had “so much fat” and “was bad [for her]”, went away as she got older and formed her own impressions and opinions.“It wouldn’t happen this time, because I kind of know why [these problems] were there before and that none of those things really can affect me,” she said. She finds all aspects of skating much more enjoyable now. “I’m skating for a different reason now. I’m really skating just to skate now.”“It’s the team that she decided, it’s the people that she trusts. And all of this gave her such a level of empowerment and such a level of freedom of really of using us as people that are guiding who she is, but not deciding who she is and how she has to do things,” Scali said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She saved songs in her Spotify playlists and made vision boards. She went in-person to designerLisa McKinnon’s studio in Los Angelesto check on costume designs. She trained at the Lakewood Ice rink, with remote training and frequent trips by her coaches before putting a pause on her classes last fall.Her short program came together quickly, skated to fellow half-Chinese Icelandic pop jazz artistLaufey’s Promise, communicating a message of sudden goodbyes, a failed promise to stay away, and an inevitable reunion. It’s a fitting song that reflects her journey back to the ice. Her free skate program radiates disco high energy and joy using Donna Summer’s MacArthur Park. Soon, Liu was landing on the podium at different international competitions, placing first at two Challenger Series assignments in Hungary and Croatia.At her first return to the US figure skating national championships in January in Wichita, Liuplaced a narrow second behind Amber Glenn. Her Laufey short programled to a standing ovationand tears from her coaches.“The difference is night and day, really. The level of engagement and authenticity that she has now, the connection. She came back better. This journey is so beautiful for her. We are fighting to keep her authentic to who she is,” said Scali.View image in fullscreenLiu reacts in the Kiss & Cry with her coaches Phillip DiGuglielmo and Massimo Scali at January’s US nationals in Wichita.Photograph: Matthew Stockman/Getty ImagesWithin women’s skating, there is this pervasive idea that you need to be younger to execute the rotations and physicality required. As people undergo puberty and their center of gravity changes, skaters have to adjust, sometimes losing consistency in skills that used to come more easily. It’s rare to have skaters walk away and return at the elite level.“The sheer fact that she took two years off and came back a better all-around skater, with stronger power, with better skating skills, with a greater attention to detail in her musical expression, like all of that? I don’t even know how that’s possible,” said figure skating analyst Jackie Wong. “People work years to try to improve all of these sorts of intangibles that she’s improved on.”The figure skating community has been supportive of Liu’s return. At international competitions, DiGuglielmo says that skaters young and old line up to meet her. “As you start to grow up, and your body changes, and things are harder, and school gets harder, you can’t fulfill all of your dreams. They look at Alysa and say: ‘Hey, I’m gonna go back and I’m gonna finish my dreams here,’” DiGuglielmo said.For all of the hype that she received when she was younger for her list of “firsts” and being a skating prodigy, Liu hopes that more people focus on longevity and break down the stereotype of having to accomplish a lot when they are younger. “I think it holds people back from once they do hit adulthood, people don’t want to try skating because there’s already this narrative that they’re gonna fail already,” she said.Making memories at worlds and beyondThe fact that Liu’s comeback has been so fast shows how innately talented she is to begin with, said Wong.“Maybe [before] she wasn’t even pushing herself to 75 or 80%,” analyst Wong said.The American women have a significant task as worlds return to Boston this week. The top two finishers have to have a combined placement of 13 or less to earn the United States three spots at next year’s Winter Olympics in Milano Cortina. Each point and level of execution will count.At the Four Continents Championships last month in South Korea, one of Liu’s spin elements was judged at a lower execution level than expected. It was her fellow teammate and competitor Glenn who took up the torch of encouragement, joking that the women would host a spin boot camp.“Alysa is such a consistent competitor and for something as simple as a spin level to be the difference in placement would be a disservice to her,” Glenn said. She notes that having Liu back has been “incredible” and Liu “lightens the mood” when things get stressful or tense at competitions. The two last saw each other in-person when they both performed at the Legacy on Ice tribute show in DC, commemorating the 67 victims, many from the figure skating community, who died during a midair plane crash in January at Ronald Reagan International Airport. Liu had skated to the song Hero by Mariah Carey to honor the first responders.View image in fullscreenLiu now has her sights fixed on a second Olympic appearance at next year’s Milano Cortina Games.Photograph: Chung Sung-Jun/International Skating Union/Getty ImagesLiu trains about four days a week now with a focus on building stamina to improve her performances on the ice. Every now and then, “just to relax [her] mind and try new things and not be too boring in practice”, she’ll try the famous triple axel – a jump that requires skaters to complete three and a half rotations in the air with a forward takeoff – that holds one of the highest point values in competition. She is also open to someday trying to land the quad lutz again, a jump she has not done in competition since pre-puberty.Although she’s successfully landing the triple axel during practices, her coaches and her agree that they won’t be adding the jump into the lineup until her stamina improves because of the injury risk.“You put a triple axel in the program, and it changes the dynamic of the rest of the program. All of a sudden so much energy goes into that jump,” DiGuglielmo said. “But I wouldn’t put limits on Alysa. I just wouldn’t, I wouldn’t. I think that would be a big mistake.”It would be great if she won the short program, he said, but one of the goals he tells Liu for this worlds is for her to be more conscious of making memories. She said she wants to go up in the stands and watch and appreciate more performances in Boston. She takes her skating very seriously, but she doesn’t take competitions seriously. For her, competitions are an excuse to skate more and showcase her passion for music and dance, rather than focus on making the podium or even the Olympic team next year.Liu carries around her Sony Cyber-shot and a disposable camera, snapping photos of friends and moments she wants to capture and keep. She journals to remember her days more. After this season ends, she plans to start school again next quarter and will go on tour with Stars on Ice and perform in shows in Colorado and Delaware before returning to training. But even without the journaling, she says she can remember this comeback journey more because she is approaching it with more intent.“It’s a satisfying feeling. If there was no one on Earth, I would still skate. As long as there’s music and as long as there’s ice and our skates, I would still do it,” Liu said.Explore more on these topicsFigure skatingUS sportsUSA Olympic teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The layoffs will impact more than 930 employees, with another nearly 200 managers being moved into non-management roles, and another nearly 800 open jobs will be closed, according to the email.Block now operates payment platforms Square and Afterpay, the money transfer app CashApp, and the music streaming service Tidal.Dorsey wrote in the email that the layoffs and other changes to staffing and organization are not being implemented with the intention of hitting “a specific financial target, replacing folks with AI, or changing our headcount cap”. As part of anearlier reorganizationthat began in early 2024 and also saw roughly 1,000 Block employees lose their jobs, Dorsey implemented a headcount maximum of 12,000 employees.Instead, Dorsey wrote that this additional reorganization is about “raising the bar and acting faster on performance, and flattening our org so we can move fast and with less abstraction”, according to the email. Last year Dorsey struck asimilar tonein notifying staffers of layoffs, saying the company needed to “build like a startup again”.Napster, now a streaming service, sells for $207m to Infinite RealityRead moreIn Tuesday’s email, Dorsey added that he was enacting cuts to staff and management levels and closing open jobs all at once, instead of over time, because “we’re behind in our actions, and that’s not fair to the individual or the company.”Block’s stock is down 29% this year so far. Its revenue and profits have grown less over the last year, creating shareholder concern, even as Dorsey has taken back more operating control during that time. Dorsey noted in his email that part of his job is to increase the company’s stock value and that this reorganization “will help us focus and execute better to do just that”.“When we know, we should move, and there hasn’t been enough movement,” the CEO wrote. “And we need to move faster to stay ahead of the transformational moment our industry is in, so we’re able to continue increasing access, openness and automation.”A spokesperson for Block did not respond to calls and email seeking comment.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyJack DorseyArtificial intelligence (AI)XnewsShareReuse this content"

The report recommends this be sped up.The report also identifies a lack of coherent systems to learn from the mass of different AI pilots taking place across government, calling for action to address this.Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the Conservative MP who chairs the PAC, said: “The government has said it wants to mainline AI into the veins of the nation, but our report raises questions over whether the public sector is ready for such a procedure.“A transformation of thinking in government at senior levels is required, and the best way for this to happen is for digital professionals to be brought round the top table in management and governing boards of every department and their agencies. I have serious concerns that DSIT does not have the authority over the rest of government to bring about the scale and pace of change that’s needed.”A government spokesperson said: “These findings reflect much of what we already know, which is why we set out a bold plan to overhaul the use of tech and AI across the public sector – from doubling the number of tech experts across Whitehall, to making reforms to replace legacy IT systems more quickly and building new tools to transform how people interact with the state.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)House of CommonsKeir StarmerComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

The last column coveredwhat to do with your 23andMe account after the company filed bankruptcy. If you’d like to skip to a section about a particular tip, click the “Jump to” menu at the top of this article.If you’re a visa or green card holder with plans to travel to the US, reports of people being turned away at airports over messages found on their devices might be prompting you to second-guess your travel plans. You might be asking whether Customs and Border Protection (CBP) can search your phone, whether you can opt out and what you should do to minimize your risks.The short answer is that yes, CBP can search your devices. Constitutional protections are generally weaker at US borders, including airports. You can try to opt out, but depending on your specific circumstances, you might not be willing to risk the potential ramifications of not complying, which can include the confiscation of your devices.Privacy experts say everyone should conduct a personal risk assessment – which should include your immigration status, travel history and what data you might have on your phone. There’s not a one-size-fits all solution because data that may seem sensitive to some may not be to others, depending on your circumstances. That assessment might affect your calculus of whether to push back if CBP attempts to search your phone, for instance, or how much you want to lock down your devices before heading to the airport.Opt out: how to stop tech companies spying on your phone as Trump promises mass deportationsRead moreWhile CBP said it only searched about 47,000 devices of the 420 million people who crossed the US border in 2024, experts the Guardian spoke to say border enforcement has been unpredictable under the Trump administration, so figuring out whether you’re at risk of a device search is not as straightforward as it once was. French officials said a French scientist wasrecently turned awayat an airport in Texas because immigration officers found texts that were critical of Trump on his phone.“The super-conservative perspective is to assume they are completely unhinged and that even the most benign reasons for travel are going to subject non-citizens to these device searches,” said Sophia Cope, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a non-profit digital rights group.If you’re a US citizen, you must be admitted into the country. That said, some jurisdictions allow CBP to work with the FBI or local police to advance domestic investigations, so there are still some risks of your devices being searched for domestic reasons.There are steps you can take to make it harder for CBP officers to access your device and the data on it. So what should you do to protect the data on your phone from being searched? The main thing is to prepare ahead of heading to the airport. Here is what you should be thinking about:Decide if you will comply with a phone searchBefore you travel, start to prepare for the possibility of being pulled into secondary screening. First, you should decide if you’re going to comply if an immigration officer asks if they can search your device. They may ask for your phone password or for you to unlock the device. Ideally, you would unlock the device yourself and not share your password. You can decide not to give your consent, but that does come with its own risks.From aguide to the borderfrom the EFF: “This presents a no-win dilemma. If a traveler complies, then the agents can scrutinize and copy their sensitive digital information. If a traveler declines, then the agents can seize their devices and subject the traveler to additional questioning and detention.”It’s possible that, if you refuse the search, the officer might decide that you are not worth the trouble because you do not present a high risk. They might let you go. On the flip side, though, declining could make the process longer or could result in border agents confiscating your device. If they do confiscate your device, make sure you ask for a property receipt so you can document that they have your device when you try to get it back. Even if you don’t give up your password, immigration officials can use various tools on your device to unlock it themselves. They can also try to guess your password, so make sure you have a strong and long password.There are a lot of reasons you might not want to risk being held back longer than you already have been or risk having your device confiscated – including that you don’t know how long border agents will keep your phone.If you plan to comply with a phone search to avoid any further complications, your phone might be searched either manually or with forensic tools. It is worthwhile to prepare for both types of searches.Turn your phone and Face ID off before entering the USThe EFF recommends turning your devices completely off before entering the US. This could return your phone or laptop to a heightened security state and, as a result, could make it harder for anyone to break the encryption on your device.Privacy advocates also recommend making sure your device requires a password to decrypt or unlock. If you use Face ID or a fingerprint to unlock your phone, for instance, it would be easier for an officer to use it to gain access to your device.Do not wipe your phoneYou might think the most protective options are to completely wipe your phone before traveling, use a burner or travel without a phone. But the EFF’s Cope said that could actually raise suspicions.“People are damned if they do and damned if they don’t,” Cope said. “If you cross the border with no data on your device, that itself can be seen as suspicious.”Instead, if you want to seem cooperative but do have data or texts stored on your phone that you wouldn’t want to be accessed, Cope suggests deleting that information selectively rather than wiping your whole device.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionEncrypt your data and use a strong passwordThe most important step to take before you travel is to encrypt the data on your device, which is different than using encrypted messaging services like Signal. Device encryption can make it harder for CBP officers to access files on your phone or laptop or recover deleted files, even if they confiscate the device and subject it to sophisticated forensic tools.Fortunately,all recent modelsof both iPhones and most Android phones come with full-device encryption automatically turned on. On an Android, double check that yours is on in the “advanced settings” tab of your “Security” menu. You will want to choose a strong password that is not easy to guess so CBP can’t walk in the front door to your device. Here’s agood primeron how to make a strong password.“This encryption is only as good as the encryption passphrase someone uses on their device, though,” said EFF senior staff technologist Bill Budington. “So the best advice is to choose a strong, nine- to 12-random-character (or four- to five-word) passphrase for the device, and make sure that biometric unlocks like Face ID or Touch ID are turnedoffwhen going through sensitive areas like checkpoints or somewhere your device could be confiscated.”Laptops, on the other hand, do not all come with full-device encryption. You can use the encryption tools some of them offer to encrypt your data. MacOS has a tool called FileVault, which you can access by searching for it in the top right corner of your screen, and some Windows computers come with a tool called Bitlocker, which can be used to encrypt your device. The EFF has a full list of tools you can use on various operating systemshere.For those of you traveling with a device owned by your employer or someone else, you will want to make sure to have a conversation with them before you travel to ensure your device is sufficiently protected.How to securely delete your dataIn addition to encrypting your devices, you should delete any specific texts, apps, photos, etc that you feel are sensitive or you wouldn’t want a government agent to see.Securely deleting this data requires a few steps and comes with limitations. If you are not wiping your phone entirely, as that may raise suspicions, you will probably opt to delete specific files. That more practical option may be effective for a manual or cursory search but may not be sufficient in the event of a more advanced search byUS immigrationpersonnel. Files may not be fully deleted, or there may be references to these files that remain on your device.On top of ensuring your device is encrypted, you will want to make sure that you’ve deleted your files from any trash folders as well. On iMessage, for instance, if you click on “filters” in the top left corner you’ll find a “recently deleted” folder. Make sure you’ve cleared texts from there as well. On iPhones, once a file isdeletedfrom both the main iMessage interface and the “recently deleted” file, it is permanently deleted, according to the company.Cope suggests pre-emptively deleting some apps your don’t want to be searched. This protective method is imperfect because an advanced search could reveal that an app was installed, but it would be a way to avoid having your WhatsApp messages searched, for instance, in the case of a manual search.Move things on to a cloud storage serverDuring law enforcement searches inside the boundaries of the US, a cloud storage server is not more protected than your devices. At the border, however, there are currently policies in place that prohibit CBP from searching online cloud services. In practice, that means that immigration officers will have to put your phone in airplane mode before searching it.“They do specifically say officers are only authorized to look at data that are ‘resident on the device’,” Cope said. “So that is data that is actually on the hard drive of your phone, laptop or camera. They’re supposed to disconnect it from the internet, if it’s an internet-connected device.”If you have data that you don’t want to or can’t delete permanently for any reason, you can delete it off your device and store it on your cloud storage like iCloud, Google Drive or Microsoft One Drive.This is a high-level guide that may not touch on the specifics of your situation.

The fundamentals of this scene are familiar – you’ve probably watched something like it in a film, or dreamed about it happening to you; perhaps it already has. But Sara lives in a new world, several decades in the future, and she is being arrested because Scout, the state’s AI security system, has flagged something irregular inside her mind.Sara seems unexceptional: she’s a museum archivist, married and mother to young twins. She once had an argument with her husband Elias after he impulsively part-exchanged the family Toyota for a Volvo. Sara sees herself as a person who “couldn’t possibly be considered a member of the lawbreaking classes”, until the moment at the airport when an officer informs her that her “risk score” is too high, and sends her to Madison, a California women’s retention centre housed in a former elementary school. At Madison, a record of good behaviour will lower her score; however, this record lies in the hands of her guards. She is not sufficiently subordinate, and can’t get her number down.“Retainees” are held initially for 21 days, then on a rolling basis, potentially for ever. This isn’t punishment but risk management, for anybody considered likely to commit a crime. Every citizen has a risk score, extrapolated via algorithm from personal cloud data, from surveillance networks, and from the Dreamsaver – a widely used skull implant that delivers more restful sleep. The small print of Dreamsaver Inc grants the company rights to share the user’s dreams with the government. People are OK with this; it seems to have reduced terrorism.The Dream Hotel has a burning quality, both in its swift, consuming escalation and in the clarity and purpose of what it showsThe Dream Hotel is Laila Lalami’s fifth novel – earlier works received nominations for the Booker, Pulitzer and National book awards – and has been longlisted for the Women’s prize. Her 2020 nonfiction book, Conditional Citizens, draws on her experiences as a Moroccan American to think about her adopted country’s two-tier system: how rights and freedoms are, in practice, exercised very differently across race, class, gender and national origin. Lalami’s fiction has explored the way these differences play out across a range of times and places: from Hope and Other Dangerous Pursuits (2005), on migrant experiences in modern Morocco, toThe Moor’s Account(2014), inspired by the true story of a 16th-century Black man who survived a notorious Spanish colonial expedition to the Americas. Her most recent novel, 2019’sThe Other Americans, is set in California in the shadow of the Iraq war, and follows the causes and repercussions of the moment when Driss, a Moroccan immigrant, is killed at an intersection by a speeding car.In The Dream Hotel, Lalami turns to the future. The novel is especially interesting as a vision of how AI could weave itself into the two-tier system that she has described and reimagined in earlier works. Sara contrasts the apparent neutrality of Scout’s “new era of digital policing” with the racist treatment her Moroccan immigrant parents received at US airports during her childhood. However, familiar prejudices are built into new tools, which search for specific deviations from an enforced norm. Some bad arguments and weird dreams, a relative who has been in prison and a history of drug use are enough for conviction. Sara’s medical notes link to a record documenting that she was the victim of a sexual assault when she was 19. This adds three points to her risk score.Reading The Dream Hotel is a physical experience: it’s rare for a novel to induce so strong a sense of powerlessness and frustration. Like many technologies, Lalami’s AI renders its users, from the individual to the state, simultaneously smarter and more stupid. It harvests vast quantities of data, then fundamentally misunderstands it. Meanwhile retainees’ hearings are randomly deferred; visits denied; phone calls cut off and overcharged; privacies invaded. “Prison is a place beyond shame.” Sara gradually absorbs the reality that she has become one of the people the state can punish. She dispatches emails of complaint to an interface whose blank replies denote impunity: “We are working to resolve service disruptions”; “This ticket is marked as resolved.”In this sharp, sophisticated novel of forecasts and insightful takes, what I found most powerful was the great bewilderment that the characters share. Lalami traces the upheaval of AI through systems and structures into personal lives, close relationships and quiet thoughts. Sara privately questions whether she has a hidden potential for violence. An interlude at the centre of the novel follows a tech executive who is straining to make sense of her vast yet miserable power.Perhaps you wouldn’t ordinarily pick up a novel in search of an experience of confusion. But The Dream Hotel has a burning quality, both in its swift, consuming escalation – you can’t look away – and in the clarity and purpose of what it shows. Sara is drawn into the bizarre logic through which imprisonment and a two-tier system make one another make sense. “She must’ve done something,” says one new retainee of a longtime resident. “I mean, if they’rekeepingher here this long, then they must have something on her.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Much as it may seem laughable that the presidentwantsthe Nobel peace prize, his quest may be the best chance we have for securing any US government regard for the rights and lives of Palestinians inGaza.Trump currently seems toendorsethe strategy of the Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, of trying to pummel Hamas into accepting defeat. ToforceHamas to release its remaining hostages and to disband its diminished military force, Netanyahu hasresumedIsrael’s strategy ofstarvingandbombingPalestinian civilians. In less than a week, about600Palestinians have already been killed.Thesecond phaseof the ceasefire was supposed to have led to the release of Hamas’s last hostages in return for the freeing of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and a permanent end to the fighting. Instead, the Israeli government has unilaterally changed the terms. It wants the hostages released and Hamas dismantled without committing to end the war. Hamas has rejected that one-sided ultimatum, evidently worried that Netanyahu would then resume attacking Palestinian civilians unimpeded.What the accidentally leaked war group chat reveals about the Trump administration | Moira DoneganRead moreThis is not an idle fear. The point of the renewed attacks may not be simply to wrest concessions from Hamas. The vast majority of the hostages freed so far have been released after negotiations rather than by military action, and most families of the hostages, prioritizing survival of their loved ones,wanta negotiated solution.Rather, Israel’s aim may be to advance the project of expelling Palestinian civilians from Gaza, the longtime dream of the Israeli far right. Already the defense minister, Israel Katz, isthreateningto seize and annex parts of Gaza, and Netanyahu is reportedly planning a new and largergroundinvasion. Now that Trump has endorsed theforced permanent deportationof 2 million Palestinians from Gaza – a massive war crime and crime against humanity – Netanyahu may feel he has a green light to pursue that callous strategy.Tellingly, the far-right Israeli politician Itamar Ben-Gvir hasrejoinedNetanyahu’s governing coalition aspolice ministernow that the temporary ceasefire, which he opposed, has ended. Head of the pro-settler, nationalist-religious Jewish Power party, Ben-Gvir has long been unabashed about his desire to “solve” the conflict in Gaza bygetting ridof the Palestinians. And we should recognize that Gaza would most likely be just a prelude to the occupied West Bank.In these circumstances, a deal withHamasseems unlikely. Why would Hamas capitulate if that would permanently separate the Palestinian people from their homeland?Netanyahu and Trump maycalculatethat overwhelming military force, if applied with sufficient brutality, would force Hamas’s hand. That has long been the Israeli strategy. Trump has evenresumeddelivery of the enormous 2,000lb bombs that Joe Biden hadsuspendedbecause Israel was using them to indiscriminately decimate entire Palestinian neighborhoods.The international criminal court prosecutor has alreadyhintedthat this indiscriminate bombardment may be the next focus of his war-crime charges. Trump himself would be at risk of being charged foraiding and abettingthese atrocities – an eventuality that would not lead to his immediate jailing but would severelylimithis ability to travel to the 125 governments that as members of the ICC would have an obligation to arrest him. (Trump might ask Vladimir Putin about how it feltnot to be able to attendthe August 2023 Brics summit in South Africa for fear of arrest.)Hamas has so far shown no inclination to succumb to this war-crime strategy, and the surrounding Arab states haverejectedbecoming a party to another Nakba, the catastrophic forced displacement of Palestinians in 1948. The big question is whether Trump comes to recognize that a deal, not forced surrender, is the most likely way out of the current horrors in Gaza that he hadvowedto end.For now, Trump’s deference toIsraelseems firm, but one should never take anything for granted with Trump. If there is any constant to his rule, it is that his self-interest overcomes concern for others.That’s where the Nobel prize comes in. If Trump wants to be known as the master of the deal, it won’t be by underwriting more Israeli war crimes.Trump alone has the capacity to force Netanyahu to adopt a different approach. Despite Israel’sdependenceon US military assistance, Netanyahu got away with ignoring Biden’s entreaties to curb the starvation and slaughter of Palestinian civilians because the Israeli leader knew that the Republican party had his back. But Trump hasbecomethe Republican party. If he pressures Israel, Netanyahu has nowhere to the right to turn.That is how Trump playeda decisive rolein securing the temporary ceasefire that began shortly before his 20 January inauguration. He could do the same thing now to force Netanyahu toward a more productive, less inhumane path.What might that look like? The best option remains a two-state solution – an Israeli and Palestinian state living in peace side-by-side. The main alternatives would be rejected by Israel (recognition of the “one-state reality” with equal rights for all) or most everyone else (theapartheidof endless occupation).Trump has turbocharged the attacks on free speech at US universities. I have seen it first-hand | Sandy TolanRead moreThe Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, hassaidthat he will not normalize relations with Israel, which Trump craves, without a Palestinian state. Both the Saudis and the Emiratis have also insisted on a state as a condition for financing the rebuilding of Gaza.But wouldn’t aNobel peace prizefor Trump be preposterous? No more so than the one granted, however controversially, to Henry Kissinger. He had directed or approved war crimes or mass atrocities in Vietnam, Cambodia, East Timor, Bangladesh and Chile, but the Nobel committee honored him nonetheless for concluding a peace deal with Vietnam and withdrawing US forces. A Trump pivot away from Netanyahu’s endless war would be no more surprising than Kissinger’s about-face.Admittedly, it would be foolhardy to bet on Trump becoming an advocate for a Palestinian state, but it is worth recognizing that his personal ambitions could lead him in that direction. It speaks to the topsy-turvy world of Trump that the Palestinians’ best hope in the face of an Israeli government that respects no legal bounds is to play up what it would take for Trump to secure his coveted Nobel. We must persuade Trump to do the right thing for the wrong reason.Kenneth Roth, the former executive director of Human Rights Watch (1993-2022), is a visiting professor at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs.

It’s not a pretty sightWed 26 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 26 Mar 2025 16.26 EDTSharePerhaps one of the greatest lessons of theDonald Trumpera, for me, has been in learning the difference between being shocked and being surprised. And indeed it was a bit shocking to learn, via an essay published by the Atlantic’s editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, that a high-profile journalist had been included on a chat on the commercial messaging app in which a military strike on the Houthi rebels in Yemen was coordinated – including discussions of the timing of the attack, debates about political messaging, personnel coordination and weapons to be used – seemingly without anyone noticing that he was there.It was shocking that their incompetence was so fortuitous – that the person they included, seemingly accidentally, in their unsecured group chat about war plans was someone so uniquely equipped to broadcast their idiocy to a large audience. But it was in no way surprising that members of theTrump administrationare behaving with such recklessness, shortsightedness, indifference to responsibility or peevish sadism. Of course they’re planning overseas bombings in a group chat, I thought when I first read Goldberg’s account. Because we live in an age where the people with the superlative power are those who are least temperamentally suited for it; because the stupidity of this White House outpaces any attempt at parody; and because these guys are exactly as dumb in real life as they look on television.The story goes like this: as part of its backing of Israel’s wars in the Middle East, theTrump administrationsought to strike against Houthi rebels, a coalition of Yemeni militants and pirates who have been attacking commercial vessels in the Red Sea in an attempt to pressure the west to stop supporting Israel’s war on Palestinians. Trump authorized a military strike on a scale more lethal and less precise than those that had previously been launched by the Biden administration; according to a Signal user identified as JD Vance, the president wanted to “send a message” and convey strength on the world stage. In the chat, no other strategic rationale for the strike was offered.Newly shared Signal messages show Trump advisers discussed Yemen attack plansRead moreSuch operations are supposed to be planned in secret, so that neither the targets, nor foreign governments, nor members of the media are aware of them ahead of time; the secrecy is what keeps the military personnel who carry out these strikes safe from some threats to their lives, and what allows the US to carry out its objectives unprompted. But the planning is also supposed to be documented, as much federal action is, to comply with records-keeping requirements.The resulting measures can be intense: often, to discuss classified matters, high-ranking federal officials enter safe rooms equipped with anti-surveillance technology, in which they are not allowed to take their phones; at other times, they are only permitted to discuss such matters on specially secured government-issued devices. (Signal, according to Goldberg, is not downloadable on these government devices, meaning that the administration officials in the chat were using their personal phones.) These are measures that have been put in place in order to protect interests that are worth protecting: to guard against foreign intelligence agencies (or, for that matter, magazine editors) learning of America’s plans, to keep Americans safe, to comply with records-keeping laws. Abiding by them is a sign of respect – both for the power of the executive, and for the law.And so that’s not what the Trump administration did. Instead, in order to coordinate the military strike, which was apparently greenlit by Trump in an in-person meeting in the White House situation room, the national security adviser, Michael Waltz, created an enormous national security threat by convening a planning group on a commercial messaging app.The group chat speaks to the essence of the second Trump administration: its cavalier incompetence, its contempt for human lifeWhy did the Trump officials use Signal for this, of all things? The reality is that they’re probably using it for a lot; the Heritage Foundation’sProject 2025, which has become something of a handbook for the Trump regime, recommends using private apps to conduct official business, so as to evade records-keeping laws. Signal is an app that is marketed for its privacy and message-disappearing features: a single member of a chat can mark messages to be deleted, permanently, for all members. (In another seemingly illegal move, Waltz reportedly set the messages in the war-planning group chat to disappear after a matter of weeks.)If the Trump administration’s members are habitually using Signal to conduct official business, the danger is not only that any foreign intelligence agency worth their salt (or any journalist who happens to benefit from their incompetence) could be listening in with relative ease. It’s that the records-keeping apparatus that is meant to preserve such conversations could not reach and document them – meaning that the use of Signal would specifically make such sensitive national security informationmoreaccessible to foreign adversaries andlessaccessible to historians and journalists here in the US.The content of the chats themselves is grim, too, providing an insight into the petty and eager social dynamics within Trump’s inner circle and the administration’s principle-thin commitment to any understanding of policy. Vance pipes up to suggest delaying the strike; he claims to be worried about public opinion on the issue, and complains that an attack on theHouthiswould provide economic benefits to Europe, who he wants to punish for some reason. He does not seem to feel he has enough clout to actually oppose the strike, however, undermining his own complaints with caveats that he will defer to others.The defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, chimes in, clearly thinking he’s supposed to be the center of attention, to eagerly but insubstantially support Vance’s points before pivoting to saying he wants to go ahead with the strike anyway. He has the cringing eagerness of a personality hire: he wants to be seen talking, but doesn’t really have much to say.Stephen Miller, Trump’s surrogate in the chat, says, bizarrely, that Europe will be made to compensate America for the strike at some later date, reflecting the Trumpian vision of all politics as an extortion racket to extract money, favors, or – perhaps more to the point – shows of deference. Everyone defers to Miller immediately. It is a group of very stupid people, trying to create post-hoc justifications for something their boss told them to do, not thinking too hard about what they’re actually doing – which is killing people.There is a risk, in talking about the Trump administration’s decision to plan a military strike over a Signal group chat in which they accidentally included a prominent journalist, of making it seem like the only problem with the administration’s actions was in their breach of confidentiality and decorum.But the controversy that erupted about the Signal chat after Goldberg revealed his inclusion on Monday seemed almost to overshadow the strategic folly and moral depravity of the strike itself: a reckless escalation in a volatile region that risked provokingIran, the Houthi’s backer and a nuclear state, and which took the lives of 53 human beings, including five children. That the strike seems to have been planned in a way that endangered national security and violated several federal laws should not blind us to the fact that the strike itself was stupid.But there is something in the story of the accidentally leaked war secrets group chat that speaks to the essence of the second Trump administration: its cavalier incompetence, its contempt for human life, its fealty to grievance and resentment, indifference to consequence, and jeering, jocular enthusiasm for violence. It shows us something about the Trump administration that we have previously seen only rarely: what they act like when they think they are in private.

Namely, himself. The United States’ war plans are being divulged to journalists like gossip on a second-rate Real Housewives spinoff, but the focus of the American president is squarely on a painting of himself that he doesn’t care for. Trump posted on Truth Social, his personal squawk box for various grievances, that he takes umbrage with a depiction of his face in the Colorado state capitol.The painting depicts Trump as full-faced, cherubic and without wrinkles. He almost looks younger, like a large baby in a suit. Aboss baby, if you will. You might assume that at 78, Trump would jump at the chance to shave a few years off his face, but sadly, it seems he’d prefer to look like he waslit by the director of photography from Nosferatu.If I had to put my art critic hat on, I’d say Trump almost looks regal in the Colorado painting. Squint, and he resemblesHenry VIIIafter a shave. You’d think he’d be flattered by that association. After all, Henry VIII had twice the number of wives Trump has. So far.Trump outburst prompts removal of his ‘distorted’ portrait from Colorado capitolRead moreBut no, the ire of Trump came down fully on Sunday – and the painting wasswiftly removed. “Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves, but the one in Colorado, in the State Capitol, put up by the Governor, along with all other Presidents, was purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before,” Trump said in his social media post.The state of Colorado is an easy target for Trump. He lost it by 11 points in 2024. The governor, Jared Polis, is a Democrat. The painting was actuallycrowdfunded in large part by Republicans, but even then, for Trump, it was a perceived insult. And Trump is the kind of person to perceive insults around every corner.“The artist also did President Obama, and he looks wonderful, but the one on me is truly the worst,” he continued. I’m sure that compliment for Obama was one he typed withstubby-fingeredfrustration. No one should be getting the royal treatment but him. In a sense, that’s the most relatable thing about the man.The painting exposes him, casts him as soft, childlike and ill-prepared to wear the clothes of an adultTake a photo of me without my consent and chances are I will be horrified by the finished product – angles that make me look heavier, show off my ever-expanding bald spot or generally remind me of what I actually look like. The worst pictures are the ones that capture you in some gruesome motion – chewing your food, preparing to launch into a conversation or scratching some intimate area on your body. We’re used to ourreversed image in a mirror, our own personal fantasyland where we can pick and choose how we see our flip-flopped face to ensure we leave the house with some semblance of self-esteem intact. Photos reveal what people – strangers and familiars alike – actually see when they look at us: the facial tics, the gestures, the lumps and bumps and frown lines.Worse yet is a painting or drawing. That anyone submits to one of those exaggerated drawings from carnivals or the beach is beyond me. Why would you want a caricature of you drawn by someone you’ve never met, giving you a giant head and a pair of rollerblades or alarge pencil? Maybe someone should get one of these for Trump and see if he prefers it to the Henry VIII boss baby painting. “Sir, we thought you’d like this drawing of you surfing while wearing a backwards baseball hat and carrying a puppy in one hand.”There’s a caricature drawing of me on the wall of a bar in Los Angeles called Capri Club, if you ever find your way out here. My drawing sits among those of other regular patrons and luminaries of the neighborhood. It’s based off of a photo of me in front of said bar, having a martini. The moment captured is a lovely memory for me of a summer night well spent with friends and cocktails. The drawing, on the other hand, gives me deep anxiety. I look puffy, for starters. My substantial, jowly cheeks seem to grow every time I look at it, as though I have Dorian Gray-ed myself inside this bar. It’s very clearly me up there, but it’s not who I see myself to be. Granted, if I drew myself, I’d just be a wobbly stick with a circle for a head. So perhaps I shouldn’t be giving notes to artists.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I am pained when I think about how other people look at me. I know I’m not alone in that self-conscious whinging and navel-gazing. I wish I could blithely ignore the cacophony of doubt, but I can’t manage it, and countless people in the world feel the same way.Perhaps that’s why I’m mildly shocked Trump is so concerned with how he looks in a painting inColorado. This is a man who tells the world he never doubts himself, that he is resolute in his decision-making and is always in control. The first few months of his second term in office have been almost exclusively about proving how strong he is and that anyone who wrongs him will be punished.So why be so worried about a painting? Perhaps it’s that the painting exposes him, casts him as soft, childlike and ill-prepared to wear the clothes of an adult. His preferred image of himself is a backlit Batman villain rather than the backwards-aging Benjamin Button in Colorado. In that case, maybe the painting did its job.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionArtUS politicsColoradocommentShareReuse this content"

He is conducting business as usual while the US burnsWed 26 Mar 2025 08.00 EDTShareIn just two months,Donald Trumphas launched an assault of staggering ferocity on America’s values, laws and people. TheDemocraticparty faces a choice: does it lead the fight against authoritarianism and billionaire capture, or does it hunker down and hope the president implodes on his own? After last week’s legislative debacle, we’ve concluded that if Democrats want to fight, they need to replace the Senate minority leader,Chuck Schumer, with someone who understands the stakes.Since November, our grassroots movement, Indivisible – led by regular people organizing nationwide – has been fighting back. Indivisible groups have pushed members ofCongress, attended town halls, protestedElon Musk, and organized locally against Trump’s agenda. Everywhere we go – red, blue or purple – people ask why Democratic leadership doesn’t share their urgency.For months, we urged Senate Democratic leadership to use every tool at their disposal to fight back and raise the alarm. We asked them to stay unified against Trump’s nominees – a cabinet of billionaires and extremists who openly flout the law. We asked them to organize against Maga bills such as theLaken Riley Act, which expands Trump’s mass deportation powers. We asked them to use every procedural tool to halt business as usual. All too often the response has been: “We’re in the minority, we don’t have the votes.”Donald Trump is seeking to erase the United States as we know it | Laurence H TribeRead moreThis argument collapsed with the passage of a funding bill packed with Maga priorities. The funding bill required 60 votes to pass, giving Democrats rare leverage. They could have demanded safeguards against Musk’s raid of the government or at least stoppedRepublicansfrom making things worse. This was perhaps their only real chance to take a stand this year.UnderHakeem Jeffries’ leadership, House Democrats overwhelmingly united to oppose the bill, forcing the House speaker, Mike Johnson, to pass it with Republican votes. Then it reached the US Senate, where Schumer initially vowed to block it – butreversed coursewithin 24 hours and gave Republicans the votes they needed.This was bad policy and worse politics. History shows that the party demanding new concessions in a funding fight loses public support – and Republicans were the ones making demands. Republican leaders and Trump himself were openly thrilled with Schumer. HouseDemocratsfelt betrayed. Nancy Pelosi, a master legislative strategist, put it bluntly: “I myself don’t give away anything for nothing. I think that’s what happened.”Schumer’s defense was that avoiding a shutdown would prevent further damage and stop Trump’s rise. But those with the most at stake disagreed. Litigators fighting Trump’s legal battles said passing the continuing resolution hurt their cases more than a shutdown. The federal employees’ union acknowledged that while a shutdown would be painful, a blank check for Trump to continue his rampage was worse. Yes, a shutdown would be an opportunity for Trump to wreak havoc on federal agencies – but he is doing precisely that already while all the lights are on. From the Center for American Progress to House Democrats to Never Trumpers, a broad coalition agreed: Democrats needed to take a stand.Even if one accepted Schumer’s rationale, his lack of strategy was indefensible. He knew for months this would be the Democrats’ only leverage point. There was no excuse for entering the week without a plan or for undercutting House Democrats after they took a tough vote.The real reason for Schumer’s surrender was a mystery until this week. In an interview with Chris Hayes following the backlash, he was asked if we were facing a constitutional crisis. His response: “We’re not there yet.”It was a stunning admission. The problem isn’t just Schumer’s strategy – it’s his perception of reality. He is conducting business as usual while the country burns.Politics have changed but the Democrats haven’t – they are old and out of touch | Moira DoneganRead moreAfter the Senate Democratic collapse, we called an emergency meeting with over 1,300 Indivisible leaders across the country. The reaction was near-universal: shock, despair and rage. Our leaders – who are holding “empty chair” town halls to pressure Republican lawmakers hiding from constituents – couldn’t understand why Schumer wouldn’t fight as hard as they are. They felt betrayed. Ultimately, 91% of local leaders across blue, red and purple states voted for Indivisible tocall on Schumer to step down.We made this call in sorrow, not anger. We’ve worked closely with Schumer over the years. We appreciate his achievements. We like him personally. But the events of the last four months have made painfully clear that the Democratic party is not going to climb out of this hole by relying on the same people who led us into it. We need a leader who understands we’re in an emergency and acts like it. We need our leaders to match the fervor of the people rising up in defense of America.That leader can emerge if we create the opening. Schumer’s fate is no longer in his hands. The Democratic senators who can demand a new leadership election answer to us – their constituents. They will act if we speak up. We get the party we demand – and for the sake of our democracy, we must demand more.Leah Greenberg is the co-executive director of IndivisibleEzra Levin is the co-executive director of IndivisibleExplore more on these topicsDemocratsOpinionChuck SchumerUS politicsUS SenateRepublicansDonald TrumpTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

A tragic plane crash was baselessly blamedon DEI. AllDEI programmes within public bodieshave been ended and private contractors face cancellation if they also don’t comply. Webpages thatdefend religious diversityin the context of Holocaust remembrance have been taken down.Science and academia have been particularly targeted.Universities are threatenedwith losing federal funding if they support DEI. Government reports and government-funded research are being held back if they includeprohibited termssuch as “gender”, “pregnant person”, “women”, “elderly”, or “disabled”. Grants funded by the National Institutes of Health are beingcancelledif they address diversity, equality or inclusion in any form.What is more, this total “war on woke” (more accurately: “fight against fairness”) is happening in the UK as well as the US. Already,British companies and British watchdogsare abandoning their diversity drives. Tory leaderKemi Badenoch has describeddiversity initiatives as a “poison”.These attacks are rooted in wilful distortions of what DEI is all about. There are two big lies that need to be nailed. The first is that diversity and inclusion initiatives compromise the quality of employees byselecting incompetent candidatesbecause of their minority group membership. The second is that DEI isa distraction that holds back success. Let’s consider each in turn, using the field of science itself as an example.The notion that DEI involves putting group membership before ability and leads to the appointment of incompetent candidates is a misrepresentation of what DEI initiatives are all about. Scientific ability is not restricted to one sex, ethnicity or religion, or to the able-bodied. Embracing diversity has the simple advantage ofwidening the pool of talentfrom which scientists are drawn. DEI initiatives are about ensuring that less competent members of the most privileged groups are not advantaged over more competent members of less privileged groups.Bias starts at school, particularly in thephysicalsciences, where both girls and boys consider these “boy subjects”by the time they are teenagers. Even once you start your academic career, bias affects grantfundingdecisions andpublicationrates. Women and minorities face additional barriers tocareer progression: for instance, bothfemaleandethnic minorityscientists receive less credit for their work than male or white scientists respectively. Bias affects whetheryou feel at homein the scientific workplace. Institutions that tackle the many workplace barriers for women and ethnic minorities (child-unfriendly working hours, tolerance of harassment, culturally insensitive socialisation practices) have higher retention rates amongwomenandminorityresearchers. Diverse workplacesattract more diverse staffto apply for jobs – creating a positive feedback loop. And we know that scientific research teams andinstitutions that prioritise diversityperform better.As for the second myth that DEI is a barrier to success, diversity actually improves the quality of science.Evidenceshows that scientific papers produced by ethnically diverse teams are more impactful than those written by homogeneous teams. Similarly,studiesshow that diverse teams consider more alternatives and make better decisions.Scientists from diverse backgrounds raise new research questions and priorities – especially questions thataffect minoritised communities. The lack of women in the higher echelons of biomedical science has led to a comparative lack of research intomenstrual and reproductive health problems. The lack of black scientists has led to a neglect of conditions that affect black people such assickle cell disease. And when it comes to the intersection of “race” and sex, things are even worse. It is only in the last few years that it even became known that black and Asian women aremuch more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirththan white women.View image in fullscreenPeople attend a Stand Up For Science rally at Washington Square Park on 7 March 2025.Photograph: Michael Nigro/Pacific Press/Rex/ShutterstockMedical sciences and social sciences have long suffered from a lack of diversity in research design, leading to worse medicine because findings do not apply to all populations. For example, clinical trials have tended to test treatments mainly onmenandon white people, leading to poorer health outcomes for women or minorities. Adiverse group of researchersmakes members of minorities more willing to volunteer for trials and helps ensure diverse participant recruitment. This improves scientific validity. It also increases the trust of minorities in the outputs of research (say, the development of new vaccines) and hence the societal impact of the research (say, their willingness to get vaccinated).All in all, ensuring diversity and equality and inclusion among scientists makes for better scientists and better science. While our examples are drawn from science, they are true much more broadly. DEI initiatives are about ensuring that we always select the best irrespective of group membership, not about selecting by group membership irrespective of who is best. Science is fundamentally about discovering truth through rigorous, unbiased, transparent inquiry and narrow pools of talent or perspectives make that much harder. Therefore,DEI initiatives are necessary to achieving the core mission of science, not a distraction from it.Christina Pagel is a professor of operational research within UCL’s clinical operational research unit.

Their anti-oligarchy mass rallies have brought outrecord-breakingnumbers, testifying to a widespread popular desire to fight back againstElon MuskandDonald Trump.Filling the void left byChuck Schumerand his ilk, AOC and Bernie are becoming leaders not just of leftist activists, but of the Democratic party’s mainstream liberal base. The hard question now is how to harness all this energy into a movement capable of actually defeating Musk, then Trump.Team Bernie has already taken great steps in this direction. It’s not just that the “fighting oligarchy” tour has brilliantly succeeded in energizing ordinary Americans and in spreading a resonant anti-billionaire, pro-democracy message. It’s also the case that these events have a concrete strategic action focus, as one of Bernie’s advisersexplainedonline:For those asking, yes these [rallies] are tied to action. All have been in or near GOP-held swing districts and we are following up with specific actions to pressure their Member to vote NO on any Medicaid cuts or billionaire tax breaks – or else face electoral consequences.This is all essential. But at risk of engaging in the left’s extremely annoying habit of sideline quarterbacking America’s two most influential Democratic socialists, here’s some unsolicited advice for Bernie and AOC: ask all rally attenders to becomeorganizers. The fate of our country depends in part on channeling the excitement of these rallies into a sustained collective campaign.To generate the scale of resistance necessary to win, we need attenders not only to take action like signing a petition or attending a rally, but to get dozens of their co-workers, friends, and neighbors to do the same, as part of a sustained and escalating collective effort armed with a plan to win. In other words, we need a lot moreorganizing –and we need to leverage high-attention moments like these rallies to directly onboard everybody looking to fight back.To be fair, the fact that these rallies haven’t yet made such organizing asks isn’t the fault of its hosts – above all, it reflects the weakness of the US labor movement and the left. If we had already succeeded in galvanizing a mass-scale national campaign against the billionaire coup, I have no doubt that AOC and Bernie would be actively boosting it. But whether we like it or not, we desperately need our main tribunes to leverage their popularity and platform to supercharge our incipient bottom-up efforts.Since Bernie and AOC have such a high profile, and since America’s crisis is so dire, any organized campaign that they choose to boost or launch would likely go viral. My two cents is that the best target is Musk – since he’s so unpopular – and the best message is one focused on saving widely loved services like the veteran affairs department, social security and the national parks. There’s a very good chance that sustained, mass backlash against Musk can force Trump to throw Doge to the wolves.What concretely could Bernie and AOC ask people to do? Most immediately, I think the best bet would be to ask their followers to become organizers for the upcoming 5 April “Hands Off!” mass day of action called for by groups such as MoveOn, Indivisible and the Working Families Party. Given the breadth of the coalition calling for it, 5 April has the potential to be huge. Crucially, however, the ask can’t just be to show up on the 5th, but to spend the next two weeks actively reaching out to your co-workers, neighbors and beyond to persuade them to take part.That way, we can help ensure that 5 April is just the start of an escalating campaign capable of forcing out Musk and saving our services.Eric Blanc is assistant professor of labor studies at Rutgers University.

The administration has withheld $400m in federal funds from ColumbiaUniversity and has vowed to remove even more if its demands are not met.Columbia has anendowmentof $14.8bn and an annual operating budget of $6.6bn. The cuts amount to roughly 6% of its annual budget – a non-trivial share. In order to keep it, Columbia was instructedto adopt a number of illiberal measures: it must put itsMiddle East, South Asia and Africa Studies department into academic receivership; change its admissions policies to reduce admits of people from those regions and admit more Jewish students; and grant campus police more power to surveil, detain and remove people from campus without following the usual due process. It must accept permanently heightened restrictions on campus protest and speech and comply with unlawful federal orders to arrest and expel green card holders who havecommitted no crime, such asMahmoud Khalil.I havepreviously stressed, and I maintain, that the tumult at Columbia University and other elite schools about Middle East policy is of little consequence to the people struggling in the Middle East. However, what Columbia doesisof immense consequence to the overall landscape of higher education in the United States because of a phenomenon sociologists describe as “institutional isomorphism”.In conditions of genuine uncertainty, with competing tradeoffs and high apparent stakes, institutional leaders often try to defer decision-making as long as possible. But circumstances often force someone to make the first move. If that first mover also happens to be an institution others look up to, then those other institutions often rapidly follow suit – assuming that a school such as Harvard, for instance,mustknow what it’s doing. Few university leaders would be faulted for emulating Harvard. Consequently, its policy ends up becoming the de facto policy of most other schools too – starting with elite peer institutions and then trickling down.We call on Columbia to stand up to authoritarianism | Open letterRead moreWe can see this dynamic at work in university hiring. A couple of non-elite state schools announced a freeze in the wake of budget uncertainty. Then Stanfordadoptedthe policy, and it promptly explodedthroughoutelite private universities and “public Ivies” such as the UC system. Similar patterns are likely to play out here, too. Other universities aredesperate to avoidfalling into the Trump administration’s crosshairs, and they’reclosely watchinghow Columbia navigates this situation. This is distressing because, as theWall Street Journalfirst reported, Columbia University has conceded to most of the Trump administration’s demands without resistance.The “America First” president seems poised to successfully suppress criticism of a foreign country and its policies nationwide under the auspices of fighting antisemitism – a scourge that, while very real and pernicious, is demonstrablyless pronounced or accepted on college and university campusesthan almost anywhere else in American society. Antisemitism is certainly far less accepted at Columbia than, say, in the GOP, where our sitting president casually decreed that Chuck Schumeris not Jewish any morebecause he doesn’t accept all of Trump’s policies – and proceeded to call the Senate minority leader “Palestinian” (anothersemitic population) as a slur.This is not a partisan political point. Virtually every aspect of the Trump administration’s posture rests on track laid by the Biden administration and the Democratic party.For instance, the reason Trump could plausibly refer to Gaza a “demolition site” is because, for more than a year prior to his re-election, his Democratic predecessor (urged on by Schumer and others) supplied unlimited weapons to Israel to carry out a campaign of destruction that hasfew modern equivalents– a campaign that was not just restricted to Gaza, but also extended to the West Bank, Iran, Yemen, Lebanon and Syria. Biden’s planned successor, Kamala Harris, and her surrogates repeatedlystressed to votersthat these policies would continue largely unchanged under her watch.Even before Trump had a chance toweigh in, Joe Biden immediately characterized the protests at Columbia as “antisemitic” and declared that “order must prevail” on college campuses. Democratic lawmakers putaggressive pressureon the former Columbia University president Minouche Shafik to crush the protests. She ultimately did so with the assistance of New York City’s Democratic mayor, Eric Adams (who justified his clampdown via evidence-free statements that the protests were driven primarily by “outside agitators”).Trump celebratedthe pictures and videos of students getting roughed up by the NYPDand, upon Trump’s reclaiming the White House, the justice departmentintercededon behalf of Adams – making his criminal investigation go awayin apparent exchangefor the mayor adopting a more aggressive posture on immigration – a move that critics claim isa quid pro quo.In a similar vein, it was Biden whoenshrinedthe IHRA definition of antisemitism into federal guidance, despite the definition’s author repeatedly describing it as a “travesty” to use this definition to regulate speech and behavior. Building on Biden’s introduction, Trump is poised tosign a billthat would implement this same definition into federal anti-discrimination law – and in the meantime, he’s insisting Columbia and other schools adopt this definition in their own codes of conduct. NYU and Harvard havealready taken this step, overriding concerns by civil rights and civil liberties organizations – from theACLU, toFire and the AAUP, toIsraeli civil rights groups– who stressed that IHRA’s definition is extremely vague and provides strong leeway for institutional stakeholders tocensor most critical discussionof Israel, Zionism or Judaism more broadly, by Jews and non-Jews alike.Likewise, before Trump called upon Columbia to put its Middle East studies programs into receivership, New York’s Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul, took the extraordinary step ofdemandingthat the City University of New York eliminate a job posting for scholars who study Palestine. This is the same type of overreach Trump is exercising at Columbia – politicians setting the agenda for what can be taught and who can be hired – justified on the same grounds.TheDemocratswill not save colleges and universities. They have been key partners and pioneers for all of the actions currently being undertaken by the Trump administration in this domain.If universities are to be saved, they will have to save themselves. And if a desire to preserve academic freedom and institutional autonomy isn’t enough for Columbia University’s leadership, they should perhaps look to its own recent past to see what the wages of compliance are likely to be.Shafik did everything the hardliners asked of her: she threw her faculty under the bus at a congressional hearing, whileoffering absolutely no defenseof her institution and its value. Shesuspendedstudent groups such as Jewish Voice for Peace and Students for Justice in Palestine. She unleashed administrative punishments on protestors, and then siced the cops on them. The school has been turned into averitable fortress– it’s more secure than a typical military base, as I learned first-hand when I did a series of recent talks there (and I’m speaking as amilitary brat).What did all this capitulation yield? Still more demands for capitulation! Shafik was driven out. The demonization of the campus has continued apace, and the punishments have ramped up further. The same can be expected for all others who adopt this subservient posture. University leaders should understand that there will be no point at which their compliance is “enough.” The Trump administration seems committed to executing a set of punishments on colleges and universities and espousing particular narratives about institutions of higher learning independent of what colleges and universities say and do in the meantime. The institutions can debase and betray themselves ad infinitum and get the same outcome as if they did nothing. Indeed, even though Columbia has agreed to all of Trump’s demands without contest, the administration has not released any funds, and administration officialssuggeststill more demands will be made in the near future of Columbia and other universities.I saw similar dynamics play out after I wasdismissedfrom the University of Arizona following a Fox News smear campaign. I wasfar from the only scholarwho lost a job because of a witch-hunt. Whether the attacks came from theleft or the right, university leaders consistently think that if they just give the mob a head it will go away. In fact, it just makes more mobs hungry for more heads. Demonstrating to the mobs that these pile-ons work is a strategy for virtually guaranteeing subsequent pressure campaigns.This desire for peace, order, and non-confrontation dominates the academy. Higher ed institutions, in general, are full of people who arerisk averseandconformist. People who fall into “leadership” roles are often the most quiescent of all – allowing themselves to get steamrolled by PR teams and lawyers into servile postures, offering limp and half-hearted defenses of the academy and its mission, when defenses are offered at all. To universities’ credit, they recognize this about themselves: most university presidents acknowledge they havedone a poor jobresponding to declining faith in their institutions and the accompanying efforts to impose reforms from the outside.Small wonder the public doesn’t trust academia. Not only are we apparently unable or unwilling to address their concerns; we also seem incapable of effectively communicating our own value in society in the face of adversaries out to gut our institutions.Now is the time to dispense with both of these tendencies. We need to be more explicit aboutaddressingways our institutions are not, in fact, representing and serving large swaths of the US. However, we also need to be more muscular about pushing backagainstfalsenarratives, asserting ourvalueto society, and defending our institutions from inappropriate forms of political interference.Institutional neutrality,now the rage, is no shield for cowardice. The Kalven Report, the foundational document of this institutional neutrality movement,emphasizes: “From time to time instances will arise in which the society, or segments of it, threaten the very mission of the university and its values of free inquiry. In such a crisis, it becomes the obligation of the university as an institution to oppose such measures and actively to defend its interests and its values.”We find ourselves in such a moment now.If, in this moment, faculty refuse to make use of the rights and freedoms we have, then it doesn’t matter if they’re stripped away, and they will be. If “academic freedom”, “free speech”, and “viewpoint diversity” organizations have nothing to say to this illiberalism, or even support these moves, they’re worse than useless. If university leaders cannot muster the strength or conviction to decline to follow unlawful and unethical orders and challenge these actions in the courts, then they should resign in disgrace or be pushed out. If we, as a collective, cannot and will not stand against this overreach and defend ourselves in public – then we deserve what we get. But others do not deserve to suffer from our failure. And so, we must not fail.Critically, any resistance to the administration’s illiberal policies, or defense of our institutions and their mission, must not be framed in banal partisan terms. This is not just a matter of effective praxis (to preventfurther polarization and resentment), it’s also a matter of respecting the truth. We got here through bipartisan political actions. Moreover, the chronic failures of our own professions and institutional leadersprovided fodderfor the “populist” forces now aligned against us. We’ll only get out of this predicament by engaging with those who are currently skeptical of, or alienated from, our institutions.Musa al-Gharbi is a sociologist in the School of Communication and Journalism at Stony Brook University.

On St Patrick’s Day, when the globe traditionally turns green, Donald Trump’sofficial guestat the White House was not the taoiseach bearing a bowl of shamrock, but an unelected stooge recently found by a civil court juryliable for the rapeof a woman in a Dublin hotel. Fear and loathing of the mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor, who is facingcivil trial in the USfor alleged sexual assault of another woman in Florida, is one of middle Ireland’s most unifying forces.“We couldn’t think of a better guest to have with us on St Patrick’s Day,” gushed Trump’s press secretary Karoline Leavitt on 17 March, rubbing salt in the wound. McGregor was given access to the Pentagon, met the defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, and the national security adviser, Mike Waltz. In the Oval Office, McGregor and his family posed for photographs with the US president, a man also found liablefor sexual assault. Prominent in the photographs was Elon Musk, the world’s richest individual and Trump’s unelected jobs slasher. McGregor presented Musk with a box of his own brand cigars. Four days later, the Dubliner, self-styled “the notorious”, announced heintends to contestthe Irish presidential election later this year.McGregor’s declaration got far less attention in his own country than it did internationally. The former fighter is not expected to even make it to the starting line because of a constitutional requirement for candidates tosecure nominationsfrom either 20 members of parliament or four entire local authorities. It is exceedingly unlikely he can obtain the backing to compete in the race to succeedMichael D Higgins, the poet and former anti-war activist who has been the much loved president for the past 14 years.So far, the centre still holds in Ireland. Last November’s election returned the sametwo centrist partiesto government that have dominated since the state’s foundation. Yet the centre has its wobbles. On the other side of the Atlantic, the Trumpocracy appears to believe it can shift the tectonic plates by endorsing McGregor.Middle Ireland is politically middle of the road and is not to be confused with middle-class Ireland because frustration with perceived liberal political-correctness-gone-mad over gender equality, transgender rights and immigration transcends social strata. Despite ranking as one of the world’s wealthiest countries, Ireland is in the throes of a protractedhomelessness crisis, with rocketing house prices and creaking public infrastructure. Having reinvented itself since the 1990s from grim Catholic orthodoxy into tolerant modernity by passing referendums providing for divorce, same-sex marriage and abortion, there is a sense among some that the change has been too rapid.View image in fullscreenAndrew Tate in Romania, 24 March 2025. Tate this week targeted Ireland’s tánaiste Simon Harris as a ‘weakling’Photograph: Vadim Ghirdă/APThis creates a certain appetite for the gospel according to JD Vance, which holds thatEuropehas retreated from its values by suppressing hateful and misogynistic online commentary, banning protests outside abortion clinics and deciding to “open the floodgates to millions of unvetted immigrants”, as the US vice-president told the Munich Security Conference in February.McGregor does not need to become president to galvanise Ireland’s small but vocal minority on the hard right. He emerged as its figurehead in November 2023 when violent protests erupted in Dublin city centre after two children and their preschool teacher were stabbed on a street. “Ireland, we are at war,” he had posted just the day before on Musk’s X platform. Riot police have been deployed at anti-immigrant demos.The Irish government was given no notice of McGregor’s White House visit, not even when, in an unexplained departure from normal protocol, taoiseach Micheál Martin’s St Patrick’s Day visit was brought forward by a week. What really incensed middle Ireland was McGregor’sinarticulate untruthfulnesswhen he was invited to meet journalists in the White House press briefing room, claiming an “illegal immigration racket” was “running ravage” in Ireland. Martin said McGregor’s assertions were “wrong” and did not reflect the views of the Irish people. The Dublin Rape Crisis Centre said the White House visit was designed to “launder” McGregor’s reputation.McGregor’s White House visit has been described as “sinister” but what may be most sinister is the reason he was invited for St Patrick’s Day and, previously, for Trump’s inauguration in January. The White House is actively courting Europe’s far right. A week after making a Nazi-like salute at Trump’s inauguration festivities, Musk urged delegates at an election campaign event for Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland party not to let immigration dilute their culture. Italy’s rightwing prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and Hungary’s Viktor Orbán are seen as Trump’s best friends in the EU.Politically,Irelandis small potatoes but as an English-speaking country, the westernmost EU member and a non-Nato member it is a potential back door to Europe’s conversion to the Trumpocracy’s gospel. The country is particularly vulnerable because of the high density of US pharma and tech companies swelling its coffers.Trump has repeatedly complained about the EU’s€13bn tax fineon Apple in Ireland, and his commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, has described the country’s corporate taxation regime as hisfavourite “tax scam”. Factor in its trade advantage with the US, and Ireland’s growing economy would be plunged into recession were Trump to punish it with tariffs. The inevitable social upheaval would make fertile ground for McGregor and his ilk to flourish. The danger is real. In November, the patriarch of one of the most prominent criminal families came nail-bitingly close to winning a parliamentary seat in the Dáil.Now Ireland finds itself dragged into the international swamp of toxic masculinity as a consequence of McGregor’s Oval Office outing. Responding to the tánaiste Simon Harris’s denunciation of him and the former kickboxer Andrew Tate as “social pariahs”, thelatter was scathing. “Jealous weak men will do anything it takes to stop powerful men regaining control of the system,” taunted the influencer who is facing a rape charge in Romania, which he denies.While Ireland holds its nose at the sight of McGregor in the White House, it holds its breath at the sight of Trump fanboy-ing over him.Justine McCarthy is a journalist, author and an Irish Times columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

TV series such asAdolescence, media attention tosexist “manfluencers”like Andrew Tate, and community concern about“toxic masculinity”all raise the question of how to raise good boys and men.What can parents do to help raise boys who will become positive members of their community, men who treat the people around them with respect and fairness?‘Real’ men: how are masculine norms changing?For parents to be part of the solution, we first have to learn a little about the problem.“Masculinity”refers to the set of behaviours and roles associated with being a boy or a man. Traditional norms of masculinity tell males that they should be tough, aggressive, risk-taking, stoic, heterosexual, homophobic, emotionally constipated, hostile to femininity and dominant. These stereotypical expectationshave weakened in Australia in recent decades. There are growing emphases on male emotional expressiveness and nurturant fathering, a blurring of the boundaries between straight and gay, and increasing acceptance of the ideal of gender equality.Adolescence, the backlash: the nightmare of making hit TV in terrifying timesRead moreTraditional masculine norms do, though, still shape boys’ and men’s lives. Forabout one-fifth of boys and young men, strong endorsement of stereotypical manhood plays out in behaviours that harm themselves or harm others. Some young men face harm to themselves: they lack close friendships and support, consider suicide, take risks while drunk or high, or drive dangerously. Conforming to some aspects of traditional definitions of manhood can also bring rewards, such as success at work or status in male peer groups.More widely, boys and young men in general experience “gender policing”, efforts by others to encourage behaviour in line with influential norms of gender and to punish behaviour that strays away from these, including through verbal and physical abuse. This policing comes particularly from male peers, and parents, but also others.Boys and men who do not conform to dominant models of masculinity, whether because they are unable or unwilling to do so, pay a particular cost. They may suffer violence, abuse, marginalisation or stigma.Some boys and young men harm others. Most would never use violence against a girlfriend or other girl or woman. But a minority – again, a larger minority than many parents want to recognise – do perpetrate violence, particularly those who agree most with sexist norms of disrespect and male dominance.Australian data tells usthat most young men support gender equality and most reject violence, dominance and control in relationships. But a minority – one-quarter to one-third, depending on the issue –do endorse aspects of sexism. And although the evidence is only anecdotal, it is possible that we are seeing an increase in more hostile, misogynist forms of sexism among some cohorts of boys, whether prompted by pornography, anti-feminist social influencers, or something else.There is also profound diversity among boys and young men. Different groups have very different levels of access to resources, power and status, because of other social inequalities, depending on their economic position, ethnicity and other factors.How do we raise good men?It is not fair to look only to parents to address the harms that boys and young men suffer and cause, when schools, social media platforms, governments and communities can play a role. Still, parents can be powerful influences on the kinds of men their boys will become.Parents can encourage strong norms of gender equity among their children, model shared decision-making andchallenge rigid gender roles and stereotypes. Parents can encourage empathy and kindness. We can teach our sons how to deal safely with anger and aggression, developing their emotional intelligence or literacy.Parents can ask boys about how they want to be seen and about the values and morals they aspire to live by, to help motivate them to invest in positive ways of being. Talk to sons about the messages about manhood they notice in media, music and elsewhere. What is positive about them and what is negative, sexist or limiting? Note the value of some stereotypically masculine qualities, such as courage, leadership and strength, and of stereotypically feminine traits such as caring and empathy, and how these can be put into practice.Young people: share your thoughts on the Netflix show AdolescenceRead moreWith teenage boys, parents shouldtalk about sexual consent, rape and healthy relationshipsas part of regular chats about life, love and growing up. Talk to them about positive, pleasurable sexual involvements and relationships, noting that these are based on consent and mutual respect. Show boys that men can be considerate lovers and loving husbands and partners.Fathers can play vital roles, given the evidence thatsons learn their models of masculinity particularly from their dads. Try to provide a positive example, to “walk the walk”. Be a fair and supportive partner. Inspire your kids with a sense of fairness and respect. And when you get it wrong, as all of us will at times, acknowledge your behaviour and make amends.Talking to boys about masculinity will go better if we take a positive and empathetic approach, focused on supporting boys to build healthy, equitable relationships and friendships. Avoid unhelpful language that prompts defensiveness, like referring to men as “toxic”. Understand that boys may have had lengthy exposure to harmful messages about masculinity. And be patient and supportive in exploring these issues.Professor Michael Flood is a researcher on men, masculinities and gender at the Queensland University of Technology.Explore more on these topicsAdolescenceOpinionGenderParents and parentingFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

About £100bn worth of wind, solar and nuclear energy, with the rebuilt grid, will carry electricity to the projects coming on stream. The Office for Budget Responsibility confirms 1.3m new homes are possible – “within touching distance” of the manifesto’s 1.5m target, as Rachel Reeves put it. The massive shift into defence engineering, investing in skills, promises good jobs where they are needed most, from Thanet to Sunderland. Everything from now on depends on getting spades in the ground fast enough for this unprecedented capital investment. The OBR,halving growth this year, scores it a higher upgrade every year afterwards, promising £500 more in people’s pockets by the next election.But investing in warfare with money stolen from welfare will never be forgotten or forgiven. Wheelchairs beaten into armaments will be an abiding image that may stay with this government. Even if promises to take children out of poverty are fulfilled when the poverty review reports in the summer, even if people feel better with wages rising faster than inflation and a7% minimum wage raise in April, the stories of brutal losses further hitting people on personal independence payments will define Labour.No new taxes, the chancellor said. That was the choice Labour made. Tax reliefs for the well off stayed untouched, mega-millionaires untroubled, no taking back thenational insurance cutthe Tories gave away in a failed pre-election tax bribe. It’s technically not austerity, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies about overall spending – but it will feel austere in most public services.People know this new dangerous era needs emergency defence spending: this is a time when the nation could be asked to contribute to its security.Balancing the books at the cost of sick and disabled peopleAnna LandreDisability justice activist and researcherIn the spring statement, Rachel Reeves said “the Labour party is the party of work”.But for those too sick or disabled to work, Labour has chosen their backs on which to balance the public finances. After feedback from the Office for Budget Responsibility that the first round of cuts did not go far enough to bring down public spending, the chancellor has made changes that would save £3.4bn in total. The universal credit health element will be cut for new claimants and then frozen. According to the government’s official assessment, families will lose an average of £1,720 a year. An extra 250,000 people will be pushed into relative poverty by 2029-30, including 50,000 children.And what of disabled people who wish to work? The pledge to put £1bn into job support for people is a positive – though it remains to be seen how much this will help disabled people specifically, with anine-month waitfor the Access to Work scheme that forces many disabled people out of their jobs. Labour has promised fewer assessments for disability benefits, but the reform leaves out most redundant assessments disabled people face in other parts of government. Why not create a more efficient, joined-up system?Disabled people already in work will see changes to the eligibility threshold to personal independence payment (Pip, which is not an out-of-work benefit) that may push them out of employment. Many use it to cover the extra costs of working with a disability, such as buying assistive devices or paying for taxis. (It is worth noting that this government seems to havescrappedthe pledge to put accessibility at the heart of new rail policy.)Cutting Pip eligibility will also cause appeals to soar, offsetting any savings this government hopes for. (Last year, the DWPspent £50mon Pip appeals.) The Disability Policy Centre has also forecast £1.2bn inadditional coststo the NHS and other services.Will Labour’s give and take enable more disabled people to work or fewer? Right now, it seems poised to cost more than it saves.From a green superpower to a defence superpower – this is a betrayalFatima IbrahimCo-founder and co-director of Green New Deal RisingThis spring statement is an assault on our generation’s future. From a “clean energy superpower”, as Keir Starmer once put it, to the “defence industrial superpower” Reeves spoke about today, the rhetoric of this government has shifted dramatically since the election.Labour surged in the polls talking about a greener fairer future, and they were elected on a platform that promised green jobs, warm homes, cheaper bills, and GB Energy – one of the few flagship policies they consistently pushed, and one that remains popular with voters.But since coming into power, its talk of “growing the economy” has involved sweeping cuts hurting those who need support most, and a hawkish obsession with the defence sector, with an extra £2.2bn for the Ministry of Defence. People want to see investment in industries that will create jobs and cut bills. The renewable energy sector can do both, unlike building more tanks and weapons.Labour was right to put green policies at the heart of its original plans for growth. The green economy grew by 10% in 2024,generating £83bn. So if this government is serious about growth, why are they not investing properly in its strongest, most sustainable pathway? And why isn’t it considering other fairer ways to generate the money we need, such as taxing wealth?Where are the tax rises for people like me?Julia DaviesJulia Davies is a millionaire investor, lawyer and a member of Patriotic MillionairesIt’s incredibly disappointing that while repeating that the government is on the side of working people, the chancellor has in fact delivered to them another financial blow.The chancellor said: “We can’t tax and spend our way to prosperity”, minutes after confirming welfare and aid cuts. We cannot cut our way to prosperity either. Many disabled and vulnerable people are now living in fear. Meanwhile, patriotic millionaires like me – the people with the broadest shoulders – are telling MPs we can and should contribute more.We need to tax the super rich. While it’s good news that the government plans to invest more in HMRC and crack down on tax evasion, it’s simply not enough. A tax of just 2% on assets over £10m would alone raise£460m a weekand would affect only 0.04% of the population. Based on recent statements none of us expected that reform today, but we’ll be looking to the autumn budget for more ambition, as the country can’t afford to wait.The chancellor claims people will be £500 a year better off from 2029. It’s not good enough – the British people need a better deal right now. Seven in 10 millionaires and three quarters of the publicsupport higher taxes on wealth– as do many MPs. If the chancellor really does want a stronger economy, she needs to get serious about fairly taxing wealth.Labour’s problem runs much deeper than the fiscal rulesJonathan PortesProfessor of economics and public policy at King’s College London and a former senior civil servantBlame Tony Benn. The requirement for the government to publish at leasttwo official economic forecasts each year, enshrined in his 1975 Industry Act, has collided with the chancellor’s commitment that those forecasts be consistent with her fiscal rules. Without that we wouldn’t really need a spring statement all.The government has promised a spending review, an industrial strategy and an immigration white paper, all to come, not to mention a reset of our relationship with the EU. After that we will know the policy specifics behind the government’s strategy. Meanwhile, largely outside our control, we will also get a much better idea of just how much damageMaganomicswill do.So it would have been far better to wait until October and look at tax and spending in the round. Instead, alongside some really positive improvements to help support people into work, the government has hastily thrown together a package of cuts to disability benefits to “balance the books”. The problem isn’t the fiscal rules themselves,although the need to get within their lines twice a year is unnecessary. Ultimately,the constraint that government should balance tax and spending over the medium to long term, while borrowing to invest, can’t really be dodged, rules or no rules.By October the numbers will have shifted again, but the basic challenge will remain the same: how to restore productivity growth and improve living standards, while repairing Britain’s public services and addressing what should in any civilised society be unacceptable levels of poverty and destitution, all in the face of an ageing population. There is some genuinely good news in today’s statement – on planning reform, further increases to capital investment, and on training. But more will be required – not just higher taxes, but major tax reforms, and willingness to take some difficult political decisions on social care, immigration, EU relations and much more.Civil servants want reform – but not like thisMike ClancyGeneral secretary of the Prospect trade unionCivil service reform was one of the key themes of this spring statement, with a series of interventions by ministers culminating in the announcement of a target for a15% reduction in civil service administrationspending. Some of the reforms are very welcome, but there is a real danger that a positive agenda for change is being overtaken by the desire to find savings.A pledge to double the number of data and digital specialists is long overdue, and will help to modernise public service delivery and free up civil service time for more specialist work. The creation of a transformation fund allowing departments to bid for resources to, for example, overhaul outdated systems is a step in the right direction.But all of this comes in the context of the desire tosave £2.2bn from the civil serviceadministration budget and to reduce the rate of spending increases in departmental budgets. This funding doesn’t just cover “back room” functions, it covers a variety of roles in the civil service including scientists, policy officers and whole departments, including the Treasury.Reform requires investment in people and technology. Starting with a savings target, rather than a clear sense of what the civil service needs to deliver, is the wrong way to implement a programme of change and risks resulting in a disjointed approach that weakens rather than strengthens the civil service.Labour may have backed away from blunt headcount targets and the divisive language of the last government, but some of the words used about public servants and briefings about “project chainsaw” have caused serious relationship damage. If the government wants civil servants to be partners in reform, then it needs to work hard to rebuild this trust.Cutting aid will make Britain less secureDhananjayan SriskandarajahChief executive of the New Economics Foundation and author of Power to the PeopleOf all the choices that lie behind today’s spring statement the one I find most heartbreaking and wrongheaded is the choice to cut aid, as expected, to fund increased defence spending. On a day like this, my mind goes to the clinic for malnourished children I saw in Somalia or the programme to provide clean water in war-stricken Yemen. These are the sorts of life-saving programmes that will shut down as international development budgets are slashed to their lowest levels since records began in 1979,according to one estimate.A party elected on a manifesto pledge to“turn the page to rebuild Britain’s reputation on international development”has shown today that it is turning its back not just on the world’s poorest but also Britain’s strategic interests. If Rachel Reeves really wants to secure Britain’s interests she needs to see diplomacy, development and defence as complementary not competing approaches. Hard and soft power work together.In our rush to become a “defence industrial superpower”, Reeves has even added £2bn of UK Export Finance to help foreign buyers of British-made weapons to take out loans. That may help grow our economy a bit, but it won’t necessarily make the world a safer place. Meanwhile, cutting aid undermines our ability to stabilise fragile states and manage forced migration, reduces our ability to strike alliances that enhance national security, and cedes the ground to emerging powers such as China – including to pursue business and commercial interests that will be critical for Reeves’s search for growth. Like so much in today’s statement, what may seem like savings in the short term will have huge human and strategic costs in the long term.Explore more on these topicsSpring statement 2025The panelBudgetTaxTax and spendingEconomic policycommentShareReuse this content"

But the one on tax cuts has made life rather difficult for Peter Dutton and Angus Taylor to match without massively increasing the deficit – or telegraphing huge cuts just weeks from an election.The budgetwas not a horror. Austerity budgets always are about hitting low-income earners and cutting back on services that are largely unused by anyone earning more than the average full-time wage. So that is good. But to be honest, there just wasn’t any great ambition.The Coalition’s2022 budget, I suggested at the time, revealed a government with no ideas and showed the government in its death throes. It’s only real item of note was a $420 increase in the $1,080 low-middle income tax offset (LMITO) that bizarrely went from $420 to $0 the moment you earned a dollar over $125,999.Australia budget 2025: the seven graphs you need to see | Greg JerichoRead moreAs far as election bribes went, it was dumb and pointless because it was for one year only. It was just an “oh gosh, our stage-three tax cuts are terrible, better bribe some people” response.This time the government chose to deliver a tax cut. And that’s fine. It targets those earning less than $45,000 and it doesn’t give swags of money to the richest.All good.But at a cost of $7.7bn in 2028-29, that’s about 50% more than it would cost to have increased jobseeker by $200 a fortnight.That is a choice. It’s a choice that might be politically good but it leaves a lot of people living 38% below the poverty line for no good reason, other than the government chose to do that.And even were it to increase jobseeker by $200 it would merely restore the level back to where it was in the 1980s under Bob Hawke – still about 25% below the poverty line:If the graph does not display, click hereThe government chose not to touch the capital gains tax discount – which gives around $18bn in 2025-26 to the richest 10% while distorting the housing market.So that’s a choice. Not an economic one; a political one.But while the tax cuts do, in my view, have good economic cause (helping low-income earners), they also were one of the sharpest political moves of late.Taylor has spent the best part of the month going around marginal seats throwing around the line that Australians on average are paying $3,500 more in tax than they were in June 2022 due to bracket creep.At the same time, he has also been clear that there was no prospect of the Liberal party going to the election promising tax cuts – which research by my colleagues at the Australia Institute has found meant it would be the first time since 1972 the Liberal party had not offered personal tax cuts at an election.Here was Taylor on Tuesday morning:JOURNALIST: So maybe a stage-four tax cuts?ANGUS TAYLOR: (Laughs)Now Jim Chalmers has a tax cut and Taylor has currently nothing other than the weird suggestion that it is a hoax.But what about Taylor’s claims of $3,500 more tax? Surely that overshadows the $268 tax cut?First of all, you have to realise that Taylor’s $3,500 figure is dumb. Yes, people are paying more tax but they are paying more tax because they are earning more money! That is not bracket creep; that is the marginal tax system at work.And people are not on average $3,500 worse off – they still have more money after tax than they did before.But he is right – some people are paying more tax than in June 2022 – and the major reason,as I noted back in April 2023, was the decision in Josh Frydenberg’s March 2022 budget to end the $1,500 LMITO.Oddly, Taylor has not mentioned that.Bracket creep is also an issue that mostly affects those on low incomes, but the LNP’s preferred version of the stage-three tax cuts didn’t care about them at all.Oddly again, Taylor has not mentioned that.Let’s just recap the state of play, given these new tax cuts on top of the stage-three tax cuts (and compared to the old stage three).If the graph does not display, click hereAfter these new tax cuts, everyone who earns less than $153,500 would be worse off if the government had decided to keep the old stage three.But that does not account for the end of the $1,500 LMITO.So let’s show what that looks like:If the graph does not display, click hereUnder the old stage three, anyone earning less than $96,900 was going to be worse off after the tax cuts and losing the LMITO. Now mostly everyone earning under $31,700 will be better off.It shows the huge impact of removing the LMITO, and also the problem for Taylor and Dutton given they have rejected the tax cuts.It is pretty much impossible to do their own version of a tax cut in a way that will make things better for those earning around the median wage of $62,500 – let alone those on average full-time wage of $106,000 – without spending more money.For example, they could lower the 30% tax rate for incomes between $45,000 and $135,000 to 29%. That would cost roughly the same – but everyone who earns less than $98,500 would be worse off than under the government’s changes, and those on $106,000 would be only $74 better off.As soon as you lower that rate to say 28%, yes people are better off, but you are spending almost double the amount – so you need to find about $25bn in cuts over the next four years. Have fun selling that.Who knows, maybe Dutton will announce a tax cut tonight in his budget reply. He could reintroduce a version of the LMITO around $550. That might cost much the same but would be better targeted by not giving anything to high-income earners. Will that happen? The odds are unlikely.Either way, tax is now a major part of both the ALP’s and LNP’s election campaigns. And many of the other choices that would help the unemployed or reduce tax breaks to the rich will be likely left for someone else to worry about.Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsAustralian budget 2025GrogonomicsAustralian economyAustralian politicsLabor partyCoalitioncommentShareReuse this content"

It may be profitable for shareholders but it’s destructive for everyone elseWed 26 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 26 Mar 2025 13.43 EDTShareWelcome to Mipim, the world’s largest real estate fair, which returned to Cannes this month. Picture an ocean of property developers in blue suits and puffy gilets thronging theFrench beachfront. Inside the convention centre, instead of salespeople fronting the booths, you’ll find politicians talking up their region’s heritage, sport teams, music scenes, universities and waterfronts, with glossy prospectuses to tempt global investors.About one-quarterof Mipim attendees are from the UK, with every British banner and brochure focused on one thing: courting investors with the promise of growth. A billboard declares Manchester “The UK’s Growth Opportunity”. Another proclaims that in the Tees Valley, “Anything is Possible”. Newcastle’s CEO and director of investment and growth tell me how the city makes development “dead easy for investment”. But the question is: growth for whom?At a panel discussion, six senior officials from across the north of England vie to seduce an audience of investors – like Dragons’ Den for property tycoons – to choose their city to build major new property developments. After decades of Tory austerity, and with no sign of Labour restoring council funding to its full pre-2010 levels, this is what Britain’s municipalities are reduced to: grubbing for cash to build projects they cannot afford to fund themselves. It’s an unedifying spectacle to see local governments pleadingat the feet of international capital.After hearing yet another UK council leader lionise the growth opportunities for investors in their city, a consultant next to me mutters: “How do they expect to increase returns for investors without increasing inequality?” It’s a damning question – one which cuts to the heart not just of Mipim, but the whole sector of investment-led real estate development.Private sector property investors are not altruists. Backers may be persuaded to support major developments, with councils promising to smooth the process of securing planning permission, but there’s no such thing as a free lunch. When investors put their money into real estate, whether they’re building housing, retail or commercial skyscrapers, they are always hoping to pump up the local land value, pushing up rents to make chunkier profits.But when property prices grow faster than local wages, inequality shoots up too, strainingpoorer communitiesand displacing businesses.Poorer families spendmore of their income on housingthan rich ones, and the higher that development raises prices, the more extreme the disparity becomes.We see this when longstanding affordable cafes shut in the shadow of a shiny new tower because they canno longer afford the inflated lease, or our kids can’t afford to live where they grew up despite there beingmore new homes in the area than ever.And while big developments can generate local construction jobs, not all that investment goes into the local economy. Britain runs a trade deficit of more than£14bnon building materials, for example, meaning a significant proportion of the price of a new tower block is often immediately going out of the country on importing foreign steel and timber. When the original investors are based overseas, as is the case with our big build-to-rent developers – the majority of which areowned by foreign private equity firms– their profits also leave the UK.In 2016, London was in the grips of a post-Olympics, pre-Brexit boom, and City Hall officials could see that the unfettered growth of the preceding years had come at a cost.Finn Williams, then an officer at the Greater London Authority, told me: “Social infrastructure was becoming more and more stretched. Estate regeneration was displacing existing communities and causing environmental damage. The production and performance spaces that our cultural scene depended on were being lost to redevelopment.”A two-tier housing market will be the result of Labour’s half-baked leasehold reform plans | Harry ScoffinRead moreWilliams and his team saw that growth was not inherently good for London, as many had previously assumed. They realised that a line needed to be drawn between developments that could achieve genuine social goals and those which were simply extracting value for shareholders by jacking up asset prices. So in 2017, shortly after he was elected mayor, Sadiq Khan unveiled his Good Growth by Design drive – an explicit acknowledgment that not all types of growth were desirable.The big problem with Mipim is not the boozy beachfront networking – it is the underlying assumption that local authorities and planning departments should do whatever it takes to enable growth for investors over the good of their communities. It is a myopic mindset that risks flooding Britain with bad developments that are profitable for their shareholders but destructive for everyone else.UK local authorities go to Cannes seeking private investment because under this government they have little choice, but we may soon find that the cities we are so desperate to flog are no longer worth living in. Their future will have been sold off, one glossy prospectus at a time.Phineas Harper is a writer and curatorExplore more on these topicsHousingOpinionCommunitiesLocal governmentReal estatePropertycommentShareReuse this content"

In cities across the country, including the regime’s strongholds,protests have been ongoingfor the past week.Istanbul mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu’sdetention on bogus corruption chargesthis week galvanised the people; within days, the protests evolved into something bigger – a national riot demanding democracy, dignity and freedom. The protests reminded many of theGezi uprising of 2013, yet this time the young people who we thought had lost all hope for the future under Erdoğan and during the severe economic crisis took to the streets, risking limitless police violence by attending public gatherings which are now banned.One of the slogans adorning placards encapsulated the sentiment perfectly: “If we burn, you’ll burn with us.” While the protests were rife with political humour, everyone knows that what is happening is no joke: the country stands at a political point of no return. The die is cast. Either Erdoğan will retreat, or else. What that “else” could possibly be is a daunting prospect. Yet the people’s determination to break the wall of fear is unprecedented, and this time, unlike during the Gezi uprising, the main opposition party is “hosting” the political action – or at least trying to.İmamoğlu is not only the mayor of the largest city inTurkeybut also, with his widespread popularity, Erdoğan’s only credible political rival. Right before his detention on dubious claims made by the regime – financial corruption, being a leader of a criminal organisation and collaborating with terrorist organisations – İmamoğlu was about to announce his candidacy for the next presidential elections.Several opinion polls indicated his support would probably surpass Erdoğan’s in that election, due to be held in 2028. According to sources close to Erdoğan, the plan was to arrest and discredit İmamoğlu and to appoint a government trustee to the main opposition party. This has been Erdoğan’s modus operandi for years. Several mayors from opposition parties – both social democrats and the Kurdish party – have been taken into custody, and İmamoğlu’s arrest was anticipated. In his last video before his detention, while getting dressed, İmamoğlu calmly said that he would “stand resolute” for the people of Turkey.Taking his words as a call to action, hundreds of thousands have filled the city’s squares since the first night. The main opposition party, on witnessing the scale of the protests, transformed its primaries for presidential candidacy into a mass political action, inviting all citizens to cast their votes in support of İmamoğlu to demonstrate to the regime that support for him extends far beyond party politics. Close to 15 million peoplevoted for İmamoğlu, securing his position as the official opposition candidate.The particularities of this story may be confusing. The boundlessness of the lies and tricks employed by an authoritarian leader can be hard to follow. But what is happening in Turkey has important lessons for democracies around the world.Over the last decade, as we have seen in several European countries and the US, holding the line by lining up with centrist political parties has not been effective, andOccupy-style street politics, inspiring though they may be, do not adequately counter the rising tide of fascism. “Try again, fail again” strategies have been exhausted in recent years, the most recent example being the US. Clearly, the conventional political parties – the Democrats in the US and social democrats in Europe – have failed to harness the political and moral outrage of the masses, which leaders like Erdoğan or Donald Trump induce. The political energy flowing from street politics is too unpredictable to be embraced by conventional political parties – and the masses, with their youthful enthusiasm, are hesitant to align themselves with worn-out political institutions. So what is the solution?Turkey’s protests over Istanbul mayor grow into ‘fight about democracy’Read moreThe old-school progressive opposition parties resemble shipwrecks – they are decaying structures. They have lost all that was vital in them over the last five decades after aligning with theneoliberalhegemony, which severed its organic ties to the progressive sectors of society. They are highly bureaucratised and, as a result, paralysed giants unable to keep up with the agility of the new far right. What is occurring in Turkey right now is youthful energy schooling and shoaling around this shipwreck, breathing life into it by transforming the wreck into a reef. For days now, youth leaders have been delivering speeches at significant party meetings, continually negotiating the guidelines for collaborative action. Whenever possible, they ensure that their outrage extends beyond İmamoğlu’s arrest. Their presence irrevocably alters the spirit of the political movement and drives the social democratic party forward towards life. Throughout this process, the young learn to navigate the slow-moving giant while the giant adapts to become nimble and brave enough to counter the ruthless tactics of the regime.Not only for Turkey but also soon forEuropeand beyond, the central question of saving democracy from the rise of authoritarianism will be this: will the youthful energy of the masses be allowed into the wreckage to transform it into a living organism? One that is robust enough to challenge the historical tide bending towards authoritarianism? Turkey, in the days to come, will be answering this question.Ece Temelkuran is a Turkish journalist and political commentator, and author ofHow to Lose a Country: The 7 Steps from Democracy to DictatorshipExplore more on these topicsTurkeyOpinionRecep Tayyip ErdoğanOccupy movementProtestFreedom of speechEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Back then, “Tina” was deployed in favour of an economic model that gave us badly distributed low growth, shambolic rip-off privatised utilities, a housing crisis and social insecurity. It is now devastatingly clear that there is no alternative to discarding this failed experiment.Yet this week, our supposedly Labour chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will take a scalpel to departmental budgets already devastated by 15 years of austerity. Our government has robbed most pensioners of the winter fuel payment, and announced£5bn worth of cutsto disability benefits, which strip support from citizens unable to independently clothe themselves, or who need an aide to use the toilet. By the time of the next election,according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, all households will have suffered a fall in living standards, but the poorest will be clobbered twice as hard. This, under the rule of a party founded to represent the interests of ordinary people.The British public could be forgiven for believing they are imprisoned in a political Groundhog Day. They wake up, their leaders tell them they are awfully sorry, but they are going to have to make yet more unfortunate cuts – butthistime, pain will be rewarded by the coming prosperity. A thousand sleeps, another thousand sleeps – and the nation wakes to the same speech. Here’s the bad news: on our current trajectory, you’re going to hear that speech for the rest of your life, whatever your age.For those who fret that the monotony will bore them rigid, fear not: things will not remain the same. After all, each cut inflicts more pain than the last, hacking away at a public realm and social expenditure already shrunken by the previous round of slashing. There are many reasons why politicians are going to keep pointing to an ever shrinking pot of money. An ageing population imposes ever greater costs, and thenumber of Britonsaged 80 and over is set to more than double in the next 40 years.Soaring defence spendingwill gobble up expenditure – and with weak returns for the wider economy.Costs imposed by the climate emergencyare set to treble in the next quarter of a century.High levels of immigrationpoured billions of pounds of additional tax revenue into the exchequer: satisfying demands to close our borders accordingly comes with a price tag.The 2008 financial crash represents the moment that social progress ground to a halt in this country. Sure, scientific and technological advance continued: smartphones got more features, the internet was faster, artificial intelligence is marching on. But by the time the Tories were ejected from power, realwages were still lowerthan when Lehman Brothers collapsed. The Trades Union Congress estimated that the average British worker would be£10,400 a year betteroff if real wages had grown at their pre-crash trend.The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated that the last government left the purchasing power ofschool budgets 4% lowerthan when they took power, our National Health Service is defined by permanent crisis, whiletechnical expertsraise alarm bells about the safety of creaking infrastructure. Life expectancyremains lower than beforethe pandemic – and growth in our lifespans wasshuddering to a halt before Covid, and alreadyfalling among poorer English women. From pothole-riddled roads to ever more soulless and empty high streets, a sense of decline has become a fact of life.There is no alternative but to abandon this decline, precisely because it is so intolerable. An expectation that life will improve – not least for each successive generation – is hardwired into western society. The death of that optimism has had increasingly cataclysmic results. It has bequeathed rightwing authoritarianism, which increasingly leaves the survival of democracy an open question. The US spirals into naked authoritarianism: that would once have seemed a fantastical prospect, but who would rule that out now for European nations, including our own?The Guardian view on Rachel Reeves’s spending cuts: a choice, not an economic necessity | EditorialRead moreAn economic model that prioritises assets over investment has failed. Our social fabric cannot absorb this relentless assault on the public realm. To confront our current emergency, some Labour MPs have floated a wealth tax. They risk the wrath of a leadership that is as intolerant of dissent as it is devoid of vision. This is hardly a gimmick or an empty slogan. Back in 2020, a team of accountants, economists and lawyers set up aWealth Tax Commission. They weren’t messing about: one of its main architects specialised in helping private clients navigate the British tax system, and therefore knew its loopholes inside out.Their proposal: a one-off wealth tax on millionaire couples for five years would raise £260bn. They sought to learn from wealth taxes in other countries, not least about what didn’t work. They sought to deal with potential pitfalls – like those who are asset-rich but lacking enough cash to satisfy the tax collectors. One in 14 households targeted by their proposed tax fell into that bracket, they concluded, but they could pay what they owed over five years, and even longer when applied to private pensions.Here is just one suggestion, and it needs updating, but it is a detailed, serious piece of work by experts who know what they’re talking about. Those who deem such proposals unfeasible should consider our current plight. An economic model based on permanently stripping away security from most of the population is simply not sustainable. Human misery aside, it has already spawned profound disillusionment and despair, which rightwing populism feeds off. If taking the scalpel to public expenditure bred prosperity, Britain would now be booming. Instead, it has condemned us to stagnation and decline. Rail against abandoning our failed economic model all you like, but if voters conclude there will be social decay whoever they vote for, faith in democracy will die.

While the cost of everyday items is going up, our weekly income stays the same.I am currently living in crisis accommodation in regional New South Wales. Being on jobseeker has meant I cannot afford to pay rent as well as everyday expenses. I’m trying hard to look for work but there are very few jobs in my area.3:10The 2025 Australian federal budget: here's what you need to know – videoI have three school-age children which I share custody of with their father, and when they are with me, I stress so much about being able to provide for them, as I receive only $718 a fortnight. It would change everything if the jobseeker payment went up in line with the cost of living, but unfortunately the government has made the decision to leave it at the same rate.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailI’m in the process of trying to find a job so that life isn’t so hard, but I feel even with a job, things would still be difficult. It’s been impossible for me to be approved to rent even a one-bedroom apartment on such minimal money, which has led me to crisis housing.I feel like politicians who have never had to be on jobseeker have no idea how hard it is to live on it. While I’m grateful that the budget has reduced the cost of doctor visits and medication, this doesn’t address the spiralling cost of everyday expenses such as food.I have had to experience homelessness just because the cost of everything has become so high. But people who have never been in these situations would have no idea how hard this is. They would not know what it’s like to have to constantly budget and make even a small grocery shop last days. And I know they might think, “they can just get a job if it’s so hard”, but I’ve been looking for a job for so long and it’s impossible, especially in a rural area.I’d say to the politicians: imagine what it’s like to not have the job you have. Imagine struggling to put food on the table not just for yourself, but your children. We are just normal people trying to get by on such minimal money, and of course we feel like less of a person because of that.Australia budget 2025: the seven graphs you need to see | Greg JerichoRead moreI can’t seem to get myself out of this situation because my money is so limited. I’ve been applying for houses for $220 a week, but they look at my income, and I know I’m not even close to being accepted for it. I will probably have to be homeless for a while until someone gives me a chance at a job, but until then, life will be such a struggle. I can’t even afford to take my kids to the park and buy them some lunch while we are out. School clothes, school lunches, school shoes, school excursions anything to do with school is hard to pay for. It makes me feel like less of a parent knowing my child will feel less important to their friends who have the best of the best because their parents can afford it.I am constantly having to ask people for money, promising to pay it back when I get paid, then putting myself in hardship that fortnight because of paying that debt back. Not to mention the amount of actual debt I’m in now with fines or loans because I don’t have enough money to even pay them off, even on a payment plan.I don’t think politicians think about these things when they choose what to put in or leave out of the budget.I’d just like to ask that next time there is a budget, jobseeker is increased. We are not the kind of people who want to “live off” the government. We are just ordinary people trying so hard to get by, to find a job and to care for our kids, but the cost of living has made this impossible.Laura Azzam lives in regional New South WalesExplore more on these topicsAustralian budget 2025OpinionWelfareAustralian economyCentrelinkcommentShareReuse this content"

The hypocrisy is mind-bogglingTue 25 Mar 2025 20.16 EDTLast modified on Wed 26 Mar 2025 17.49 EDTShareTheanger I have witnessedover the past few days within the environment and climate movement has been extraordinary.I have spent the past four days in emergency meetings with leaders across the environment movement furiously responding to Anthony Albanese’s latest attack on nature.The government’scarve-out for the salmon industrymeans the environment is more poorly protected at the end of its three-year term than it was at the start of it.In case you missed it, the government hasintroduced amendments to the national nature protection lawthat sideline the environment minister and effectively terminate a review of the impact foreign-owned salmon farming companies are having on the endangered Maugean skate and the adjacent world heritage area on Tasmania’s west coast.The prime minister came to government in 2022 promising to strengthen Australia’s failing nature laws. But nearing the end this term, this move to push through a bill to weaken those very laws has damaged Labor’s environmental credentials.The Coalition is expected to support the amendments.Peter Dutton’s commentsin the past week show he is in favour of overriding established protections and processes on behalf of other destructive and polluting industries.Bill to protect Tasmanian salmon farming passes House despite fears of ‘alarming’ environmental protections rollbackRead moreYou may not have heard of the Maugean skate before and you might be wondering why this species has suddenly become the poster child for Australia’s broken nature laws.The skate is a flat-bodied ancient ray – a bit like a stingray – that grows to about a ruler-and-a-half in length from its pointy snout to the tip of its tail. It is found only in Macquarie Harbour inTasmania.It may soon join the sorry list of extinct Australian species.Pollution, including from salmon farming, can lead to conditions that choke the skates to death.In the 2019 storms, the harbourwas basically flipped upside down, with oxygen-depleted bottom waters pushed up the water column, suffocating nearly half the skate population in shallower waters. This could happen again.Scientists agree Maugean skate numbers remain perilously low and the imminent extinction risk remains unchanged, as does the threat of salmon farming to the species.The federal government acknowledges all of this. Itsown conservation advicefor the Maugean skate describes the pollution created by salmon farming in Macquarie Harbour as being “catastrophic” for the endangered fish.Tuesday night’s budget allocated $3m for a captive breeding program for the Maugean skate. And the federal government has earmarked millions of dollars to oxygenate Macquarie Harbour.In other words, public money is being used to breed an “insurance” population of the endangered fish and clean up the salmon industry’s putrid mess.Surely the more economical – not to mention ethical – approach would be to protect the skate’s natural habitat and compensate and support the career transitions of local salmon workers?But here we are. The Maugean skate survived the mass extinction of the dinosaurs 66m years ago. Now it could be snuffed out by a reckless pre-election promise from the Albanese government.The political firestorm over Tasmania’s salmon farming – podcastRead moreEarlier this month the prime minister publicly expressed his outrage when a so-called “hunting influencer” visiting Australia from the US filmed herself for social media wrenching a wombat joey away from its mother.Yet now, Albanese appears willing to put the future of an entire unique Australian species at risk at the behest of one industry. The hypocrisy is mind-boggling.But the impact of these legislative changes extends far beyond that.They could encourage big polluters to seek other industry-specific carve-outs – creating open season on nature. They will make it harder for communities to challenge destructive coal, gas and deforestation projects too.This is bad law-making and bad process – rushed through in the shadow of an election.It’s a middle finger to every one of us who has raised their voice for strong nature laws that would stop the destruction of Australia’s precious forests, oceans and wildlife.The Albanese government has fumbled reforms to our broken nature laws for three years. Now, with an election looming, the prime minister has hurried a bill into parliament that means nature has less protection that it did when he came to office.Polluting industries like salmon farming need to be properly regulated, not let off the hook.We call on all Australians who love nature and care about the future to urge Labor MPs and candidates to dump these amendments and deliver full reform of Australia’s failed nature laws in the first 12 months of a new term of government.Kelly O’Shanassy is CEO of the AustralianConservationFoundationExplore more on these topicsEndangered speciesOpinionTasmaniaConservationcommentShareReuse this content"

They are outraged because they believe that the arrest of Istanbul’s mayor is a tipping point, with the country sliding from authoritarian democracy to outright autocracy.Authorities have now arrested more than 1,400 protesters, including numerousphotojournalists. They areclamping down on coverageof a movement that Mr Erdoğan describes as “evil”, but which is driven by anger at cumulative political repression and the parlous state of the economy.The next presidential election is not due until 2028. But the arrest of Mr İmamoğlu for alleged corruption and terror links last week – he was subsequently charged on the former count – could hardly have more suspicious timing. It camedays beforehis CHP party was to nominate him for the presidency. The night before his detention, Istanbul University annulled his diploma; a degree is required to run for the presidency. Both moves have been widely decried as politically motivated.About 13 million people reacted by joining the 1.7 million CHP members in backing him as nominee, according to the party. Mr Erdoğan, too, was an Istanbul mayor who was jailed – only to triumph politically. That, however, was in a more volatile political landscape. In contrast, Mr Erdoğan has entrenched power over two decades. He weathered the massGezi Park protestsin 2013 and used anattempted coupthree years later to launch a wide-ranging purge that cemented his power and crushed broader dissent.Term limits preclude him running again in 2028. But the fear is that he plans to do so by either changing the constitution or calling early elections. The jailed PKK founderAbdullah Öcalan’s recent callfor fighters to lay down arms has raised questions over whether the government is attempting to draw support from a pro-Kurdish political party.The ballot box has been one of the last places where Turkish citizens could truly have their say, even if opposition politicians – including Mr İmamoğlu – have often been hobbled both before and after elections. People were furious at punitive inflation – and the government has now spentup to $25bnstabilising the lira due to this self-inflicted crisis. Mr İmamoğlu’s affable image has also proved attractive to conservative voters who previously shied from his party. But Mr Erdoğan presumably hopes that anger will ebb and the economic situation improve before the next election.The other dimension of the timing is international. Mr Trump, who likes strongmen, has just described Mr Erdoğan as a good leader. Europe is preoccupied by Ukraine and US security abandonment – with the latter meaning it seeks greater security cooperation with Ankara. Leaders previously swift to criticise Mr Erdoğan have been strikingly muted. Yet European governments have leverage if they choose to use it. They should.At home, the CHP says that it is shifting from daily street protests to other means, such aseconomic boycotts. But these protests have seen a striking coalition of formal political opposition and frustrated young people with their own views and tactics. That relationship could disintegrate under those tensions. But their differences have so far proved fertile and could yet lead to a more spontaneous, less predictable and possibly more successful movement than Mr Erdoğan anticipates.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The two events might not seem to be connected. But Réard, who had been looking for a name for his design that would embody the tiniest garment imaginable, combined with the most explosive impact possible, hit on the almighty atomic blast as the ideal symbol. And so the modern bikini was born.The world’s first bikininow hangs on a mannequin in the Design Museum in London, looking decidedly less earth-shattering than it did back then. Formed from baggy triangles of pink fabric, printed with a newspaper pattern and tied together with string, it looks a bit like someone has fashioned a quick cossie out of a few pages of the FT.A two-piece isn't a genuine bikini unless it can be pulled through a wedding ring1962 advert for men’s swimming shorts“It was really controversial at the time,” says fashion historian Amber Butchart, curator of Splash! A Century ofSwimmingand Style. “Swimsuits were getting smaller and smaller in a kind of arms race, tied up with the excitement of the atomic age.”Two months earlier, another French fashion designer, Jacques Heim, had unveiled his own two-piece swimsuit at his beach shop in Cannes. He christened it the Atome, after the particle of matter, and hired skywriting aircraft to advertise “the world’s smallest bathing suit” over the Mediterranean. Not to be outdone, Réard hired his own skywriters to fly over the French Riviera, announcing his bikini to be “smaller than the smallest bathing suit in the world”.View image in fullscreenBaggy triangles … the world’s first bikini.Photograph: Luke HayesIt was the first time a swimming costume had plunged below the navel, to the horror of the Catholic church, and the glee of the male gaze. Réard was quick to capitalise on its minimalist credentials. Long before the arrival of the microkini, he published adverts declaring that a two-piece suit wasn’t a genuine bikini “unless it could be pulled through a wedding ring”.The competitive shrinkage of swimwear is one of many stories threaded throughout this illuminating exhibition, which charts our enduring relationship with water over the last 100 years, across fashion, architecture, sport and more. It touches on the British love of lidos, the lure of the seaside and the rise of wild swimming, as well as delving into more niche topics, from the controversies around hi-tech performance swimwear, to the curiousMermaidcore trend of the 2020s. Theinexplicable popularity of the Dryrobeas an item of everyday clothing gets a look-in too.As unlikely as the towel-lined changing gown becoming an acceptable thing to wear to the shops, the atomic-bikini period is one of the stranger moments in the history of the swimwear-industrial complex. Displayed next to the first bikini, a 1950s photo shows people lounging beside a hotel pool in Las Vegas, as a mushroom cloud erupts on the horizon.Another shot depicts a poolside showgirl wearing a jaunty mushroom cloud headpiece. It turns out that the nearby Nevada Test Site made the area a hotspot for “atomic tourism”, with Vegas casinos offering atomic-themed cocktails and Miss Atomic Bomb pageants – where evermore skimpy bikinis were naturally all the rage.View image in fullscreenSmuggle that budgie … trunks on display in the show.Photograph: Luke HayesKeen not to be left out of the scanty swimwear craze, men soon got in on the action. One vitrine is dedicated to the furtive rise of gay men’s swimming attire, at a time when homosexuality was still illegal. Raunchy “physique” magazines of the 1950s and 60s, ostensibly marketed as male health and fitness publications, doubled up as softcore porn, featuring adverts for mail-order posing pouches and revealing trunks.“You’ll be number one,” promises an ad for a tiny pair of shorts with strategic windows cut out of the sides, published in a 1962 issue of The Young Physique, “when the gang gets a glimpse of you thru porthole cutouts.” Who could resist the “skintight muscle-conforming knit” of the latest “Orlon-Wool-Rubber” blend? Available in alligator skin vinyl, too.Such technical material innovation is probed further in the evolution of high performance Olympic swimwear, most contentiously in the form of the2008 LZR Racer swimsuit. Developed by Speedo, in collaboration with Nasa scientists, the futuristic garment looks like something from Batman’s wardrobe. It was made from ultrasonically welded low-friction fabric to repel water, with compression panels for streamlining, as well as trapping air for increased buoyancy.View image in fullscreenMushroom cloud on top … showgirl Linda Lawson poses in a 1950s number.Photograph: University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Special Collections and Archives.The full body-length design instantly saw countless world records shattered: 94% of the gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Olympics were won by swimmers wearing the sleek suit. The international swimming federation, Fina, was furious, declaring that the level of innovation amounted to “technical doping”. It was one step of ingenious design too far, and was swiftly banned.Perhaps in future contests, athletes should all be forced to compete in the standard issue grey woollen onesie that used to be rented out to day-tripping bathers by the municipal Margate Corporation in the 1920s. In the days before most people had their own swimming costume, its unisex one-size-fits-all design ensured it could fit swimmers of all body shapes.A century later, the exhibition shows how similar design principles are being embraced today, in the re-emergence of gender-neutral swimwear, created by companies such as the Portland, Oregon-basedBeefcake. Its one-piece swimsuits, “for any body, anywhere”, take inspiration from the classic costumes of the 1920s, with sizes ranging from XS to 5XL, made in small batches by people in Portland making a living wage.View image in fullscreenIn collaboration with Nasa … the contentious Speedo LZR Racer.Photograph: AlamyBeefcake’s Dreamboat design is shown alongside other efforts to make swimming more inclusive. There isRebirth Garments’trans-friendly kit – which includes a compression lining in the bottom half to suit a trans woman, transfemme or non-binary person – and elegant unilateral mastectomy swimwear by Eno for single-breasted people.TheBlob swimsuit, meanwhile, was designed by Hannah Whelanas a piece of “artivism” to open up conversations around menstruation, period stigma and swimming, with a bright red patch emblazoned on its crotch.There are plenty more design stories to discover. Along with the actual red costume worn by Pamela Anderson in BayWatch, there’s a celebration of the reinvention of Penzance’s 1930s Jubilee seawater pool,recently upgraded with geothermal baths by Scott Whitby Studio, who were also responsible for the exhibition’s punchy design, drenched with bold, kiss-me-quick colours.Marvel, too, at the evolution of goggles – including a 1940s guide to making your own wooden Hawaiian diving variety – and ponder the unlikely high-fashion adoption of pool slides worn with socks, thanks to a 1990s Tommy Hilfiger campaign.Diver Tom Daley also features with his Made With Love knitting kits, as does the recent revival of budgie-smuggler briefs, for which he is partly responsible. We’ve come a long way since2009, when Alton Towers banned Speedos, in an apparent attempt “to maintain the family-friendly atmosphere at the resort”.View image in fullscreenBeach ready … Splash! A Century of Swimming and Style.Photograph: Luke HayesWhat would the theme park make of someone turning up in the 2-metre long silicone mermaid tail? One such scaly pink fin – made by special effects designer Silvo Dordevic,AKA Siki Red– hangs momentously from the ceiling, as an example of the subcultural phenomenon of Mermaiding.The TikTok trend, which sees people dressing up and swimming as merfolk – and greeting each other with a cheery “shello!” – has been fuelled by the live action remake of The Little Mermaid, and the Netflix series MerPeople, both released in 2023. Mermaid academies can now be found from Bournemouth to Boracay island in the Philippines. It might look like child’s play, but it’s not for the fainthearted.London’s Design Museum takes a deep dive into our love affair with swimmingRead more“It’s one of the most physically uncomfortable situations you can ever be in,”according to Morgana Alba, founder of mermaid group, Circus Siren Pod. “You can’t breathe. You can’t see. You can’t really hear. You’re probably cold. And the tail is dragging you down.” On a basic human level, “our bodies don’t want to be under those conditions”.So, perfect for the next extreme fitness trend!

There were telegraph poles and hailstones the size of oranges dropping out of the sky’Interview byChris BroughtonWed 26 Mar 2025 10.57 EDTLast modified on Wed 26 Mar 2025 22.30 EDTShareIam a proud American, although that notion has been politicised to death in this country, where you’re not considered patriotic unless you’re a Republican. For mySpina Americanaseries, I chose to explore a part of the US where people are solidly conservative and won’t budge – partly because they feel abandoned by the rest of the nation.This area is typically referred to as “flyover country”, and has been written off politically, socially and culturally for decades. I wanted to meet and learn about its inhabitants while also sharing my own fears and hopes for our mutual land. It involved making myself vulnerable, but if I only approach people who are like me, what am I really gaining?I approached the owner of the nudist park and gave a speech from a stage, naked, explaining my intentionsI chose a 100-mile-wide corridor through the central US and just started driving, beginning in Texas and working my way up though Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska and the Dakotas to see what I could find. Although I don’t predetermine or schedule anything unless I absolutely have to, I needed permission to photograph inside a prison in North Dakota, to be embedded with the sheriff’s department in Nebraska, and to ride with storm-chasers during tornado season.Shooting storm-chasers involved covering thousands of miles, racing between states as supercell thunderstorms developed and predictions for the most likely place to see a tornado hit the ground kept shifting. I was part of a group of eight led by a meteorologist, though the focus was more on thrill-seeking than scientific study. Long periods of driving and downtime were punctuated by moments of absolute terror – our hair standing up as the air around us became supercharged, there were hailstones the size of oranges, and telegraph poles dropping out of the sky.This was taken after one such incident in Burlington, Oklahoma. A tornado had almost landed on top of us, and a piece of roof flew across a field towards our speeding van before miraculously lifting up. We stopped for a few minutes to gather our senses, and that’s when I saw this woman from our group silhouetted against those ferocious rotating clouds, with the grass blowing in the foreground. Until you’re underneath one, it’s hard to imagine how massive and dangerous these storms are, but I do think this gives a sense of the scale and the chaos.What I had most wanted to capture was a portrait of a storm-chaser in front of a tornado, but I eventually accepted that the shot I envisaged wasn’t going to happen. Generally, I believe the most honest approach to work like this is to do it organically. I photograph things and people as I find them, then ask: “Hey, is there anything else around here you think I might find interesting?”Riders on the storm: the scientists who chase tornadoes - in picturesRead moreThese were rural areas so I expected empty fields and elderly farmers, and I got plenty of those. I did not expect strip joints, but I ended up photographing in three of them. I asked a bartender in Texas: “Hey, what’s going on around these parts?” She said: “Well, I live in a nudist park.” I approached the owner and gave a speech from a stage explaining my intentions to the 150 residents. I was naked when I did that, and also when I took the photographs. They had never allowed a photographer in before, but they realised my intentions were genuine and that it would give them a chance to advocate for their lifestyle.I also spent two weeks documenting a Mennonite community in Kansas, and took a portrait of a pair of Amish guys who had never been photographed before. Many people have been delighted by my picture of a fisherman standing on ice and showing off the pike he’s just speared with a homemade trident. He’s from a tiny town in North Dakota and was tickled pink when I called to tell him he’d been seen all over the world.Yes, I saw political flags on lawns, but I didn’t photograph them, just as I hadn’t included images of Fidel Castro or Che Guevara in my book about Cuba. I didn’t want any of these people to be written off as partisan. Meeting them, I was blown away by how open, curious and hospitable they were, just like all of us are when given mutual respect.Richard Sharum’s CVView image in fullscreenBorn: Texas, 1978Trained:“Mostly self-taught.”Influences:“Early: Cartier-Bresson, Sebastião Salgado, Larry Towell, Jim Nachtwey.

She discusses social media censorship, sexuality, crying on stage – and her magical childhoodWed 26 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 26 Mar 2025 06.07 EDTShare‘Ihad an epiphany recently,”FKA twigssays. You have to love a conversation that starts like that. “Where I sit in the industry now is where I sat when I was at school. I was a little bit of an outsider then. And I thought, if I did this job, I’d be on the inside. But after 15 years of doing it, I just found myself still on the outside.”FKA twigs’ appearance is mysterious: the 37-year-old has wise eyes, seemingly as old as a mountain, but the skin of a 14-year-old; her head is shaved at the side, like an ecowarrior, yet she is ridiculously beautiful, like a Disney princess. Her singing voice is otherworldly and she has incredible range. People have always compared her to Björk, but the first song onher new album, Eusexua, gives a bit of texture to that comparison. Yes, they are alike, in the sense that they are both from outer space. But space is quite large.“Ethereal” is a word often spoken about – and by – FKA twigs, so maybe that is what sets her apart. She considers this and shrugs. “It’s hard to tell when you’re inside yourself why it is.”We meet in the cafe at the Barbican in London, where later she is going to see Chekhov’s The Seagull. Born and raised in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, and privately educated on a scholarship, Tahliah Debrett Barnett, as she once was, comes across as much more global than spa town, having taken a circuitous but effective route to the centre of everything.View image in fullscreen‘I’m very ferocious’ … FKA twigs.Photograph: Jordan HemingwayThe other phrase people use about FKA twigs is “avant garde”, but what do they mean? Is it something simple, as in her visual style is highly theatrical, not sexy in any regular sense of the word? Is it something more complicated, as in her music defies classification, not because it doesn’t fit neatly into any genre, but because you can’t really do anything – dance, have it on in the background, whistle – except concentrate on it? Is it because she often names her records the way Elon Musk names his children: all letters, no sounds (EP1, in 2012; LP1, in 2014; M3LL155X, in 2015)?She left Cheltenham to go to the Brit school in Croydon for sixth form, but had been getting professional gigs as a dancer since she was 12. By her early 20s, she was an incredibly successful backup dancer, working with musicians including Kylie Minogue, Jessie J and Ed Sheeran. She would perform her music anywhere and everywhere, sometimes for money, sometimes for the craic; the legend is that she got signed by an A&R guy who spotted her at a bondage club.The way she describes it, she was much more perfectionist and grafter than party girl: “I had four jobs. In the evening, I would go and perform in pubs; if I was lucky, I’d get 15 quid. The line might be six people; sometimes no one turned up. It didn’t really profit me anything. It’s a choice, isn’t it? Do I want to spend 50 quid going out with my mates and getting pissed at the weekend, or do I want to spend it on a room to rehearse in with my band?”It wasn’t a bondage club: it was a warehouse party co-sponsored by a tattoo artist and a fetishwear brand. It was there she met Tic, the Ghanaian hip-hop artist with whom she co-wrote EP1. “Now,he’sethereal,” she says. “Ethereal and ephemeral.” Has he vanished now? “He’s vanished many times and turned up again.”“I entered my career at the height of Pop Idol,” she says. “It was a new era of finding people off the street and manufacturing them into a pop star. I was never a part of that. I’m shy, you know. I wouldn’t have been good at the interviews.” She is also nothing like malleable enough for a process such as that, with a fierce sense of self that she puts down to the best years of her life.Florence Pugh said: ‘It’s amazing to see women’s bodies doing something that’s sensual, but not oversexualised’When were they? “I guess between five and about eight?” Seriously? “My mum was a salsa dancer and she made costumes as well. We didn’t have a lavish lifestyle, but I was really loved. Especially as a young child, in those formative years, my mum had a lot of curiosity in me – discovering who I was and what made me tick. She put a lot of time into that, a lot of attention to detail. It was so magical. Everything was possible, every single day. I wasn’t a princessy kid – I was quite gender neutral – but I was always dancing, figuring out how I could use my body to become a cat, or to say an idea. I grew up feeling like my body could do anything.”Her early dance training had its limits – ballet, modern, tap. “It was pre-internet and I was from Cheltenham,” she says, laughing. “As I’ve got older, I’ve understood that movement is such a deep well of inspiration.”In the same way that she could never have been moulded into the mainstream of the 2010s, neither does she fit into this “TikTok era, with kids having one song that will blow up overnight. I’ve not been a part of that, either.” She has a deep suspicion of new media’s impact on creativity: “Everyone has a voice. There’s more opinions and fans can make you or break you. They can decide overnight that you’re this and that; they can comment, they can make videos that give the wrong impression and spread through the whole internet like wildfire.”When she was in a relationship with the actor Robert Pattinson, in the mid-2010s, she got a load of abusive drivel from his fans, but by her own account her fans are sophisticated people, or they wouldn’t like her in the first place. Does she get a lot of flak? “No, I don’t,” she says. “This doesn’t bother me personally. I think it just makes it hard for genuine artists to stay original.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s hard for genuine artists to stay original’ … at the Palace theatre in Los Angeles in 2019.Photograph: Rich Fury/Getty Images for ABAYou could call FKA twigs’ a portfolio career – singing, dancing, acting, modelling – but she is usually doing all those things simultaneously. If she were a man, I think she would be called a performance artist. “When I did the Valentino show [at Paris fashion week in 2023], Florence Pugh said: ‘It’s amazing to see women’s bodies doing something that’s sensual, but not oversexualised.’ Which isn’t to say that I don’t use my body in a way that’s sexualised sometimes – that is a part of my language – but there’s a whole other spectrum, as a woman, to move in a way that’s dynamic, strong, sensual, awe‑inspiring, but not supposed to be serving. Unless that’s my choice. There’s a pole dance I do in my new show which is both. I decide when I’m serving and I decide when I’m not.”Ah, the pole dancing. This was a feminist faultline in the 90s, when FKA twigs was just a small child. We were all arguing about the pornification of the mainstream and whether it could ever be ironic enough to get away with it. In the video for Cellophane, the standout single from her 2019 album, Magdalene, she answers that question definitively, without really trying. There is some incredible choreography, with haunting, creepy special effects, in which, yes, she is pole dancing, but, no, she is definitely not serving. Commandingly acrobatic, it is a show of strength with a trace of menace. “With the pole, it’s about finding new ways to play with the ideas your body can say. Sex work is the oldest profession; why are we so outraged by it?”View image in fullscreen‘Now, fans can make you or break you’ … at Flow festival in Helsinki in 2016.Photograph: Gaëlle Beri/RedfernsAt the start of last year, this tension – surely you can reclaim and express the sexuality of your own body without having to internalise the objectification projected on to it? – blew up in the hands of theAdvertising Standards Authority, which banned a Calvin Klein advertfor an “overly sexualised” image that focused on FKA twigs’ body rather than the clothes being advertised, but then lifted the ban two months later, after she said she was proud of the image and had collaborated in its creation. It seems obvious, from any given image, that whatever FKA twigs’ body is saying about sex, or anything else, she is the one who is saying it. But not obvious enough, apparently.When she plays the song Cellophane live, fans on social media always wonder afterwards whether she is OK. It’s the lyrics, partly – “Didn’t I do it for you? / Why don’t I do it for you? / Why won’t you do it for me? / When all I do is for you?” – but it is mainly the eerily convincing embodiment of anguish. “I’m a performer!” she says, indignantly. “I think it would be more sad to be on stage and smiling. When you’re out there shaking the tail feather and not feeling it, that’s when it hurts. Not when you’re crying.”The day after our interview, she gave the keynote speech at the Audio and Visual Arts festival at the British Library and distilled this vibe – that she has been in this game a long time, is pushing 40 (her words), is competent in ways that belie the unearthly creature you see: “I know where my keys are.” Keys like keys, or keys like music? Can get back into her house, or knows what’s what? Her meaning is ambiguous, a lot of the time, but only to liven things up; it never seems to connote uncertainty on her part.FKA twigs: Eusexua review – a hymn to the healing power of the dancefloorRead moreThere is a song on Eusexua the lyrics of which fans will be poring over. She started writing Keep It, Hold It four years ago, when it was about “keeping abuse a secret – don’t tell anybody anything”. That would have been 2021, when she detailed in an interview with Elle what she described as an abusive relationship with the actorShia LaBeouf. (LaBeouf denies the claims.) It is a chilling, sad and enraging account of a relationship that began in 2018, on the set of his semi-autobiographical film Honey Boy, in which she played Shy Girl, and ended the following year. In retrospect, even the fact that he would conjure himself a fictional girl and not give her a name gives me the creeps.Just before that interview with Elle, FKA twigsfiled a lawsuit against LaBeouffor sexual battery, assault and the infliction of emotional distress, which she can’t now talk about, as the hearing is this year. I almost don’t want to mention it, because it seems so wrong for her openness to carry such a heavy price, for LaBeouf’s name to be for ever mentioned in conjunction with hers. Yet her courage in describing that publicly is a fundamental part of who she is, as is the fact that she is still, while keeping her terms very general, radically honest about what happened and what came after.Whatever that song meant originally, the lyrics have evolved, she says: “Four years on, it means something completely different. Now, ‘keep it and hold it’ means look after yourself. That light you hold as a human, always protect it. For me, I’m very ferocious. I used to think: no one will ever blow the candle out. And I still believe that, but it can get dimmed. So now it’s about: no, I’ll always protect my candle.”While she was doing her keynote at the British Library, in conversation with the DJ and club legend Nadine Noor, she described her experience with the media in a way that was a little chastening. She would show up to a conversation because it was one of her “deliverables”; journalists would ask her how she was, but not really care about the answer, as that was just one of their “deliverables”. “I’m in a place of brutal honesty at the moment,” she said to the audience. “In a gentle and caring way. I don’t have anything to hide.” People cheered, although it wasn’t the end.

They started in quite a constrained way, with titles such as Shenmue and Driver offering miniature cities to wander about, but during the 21st century, they grew to encompass whole kingdoms. Now we have titles such as Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Elden Ring and Death Stranding that contain vast and highly varied environments; Minecraft worlds are reportedly 60,000km wide. And let’s not forget space sims such as Elite Dangerous and No Man’s Sky, which effectively contain whole galaxies.This whole design model, however, is starting to seem a teeny bit unsustainable. Not only is it astonishingly expensive to build giant worlds (it’s rumoured that the forthcoming Grand Theft Auto 6 will cost in the region of $2bn), but the market is also saturated with competitors all promising many hundreds of hours of exploration. Is there really an unlimited supply of players willing to buy and play more than two of these a year – especially now that we’re being incentivised to stick around through live service features, such as regularly updated costumes, missions and locations?As a result, major studios are beginning to rethink their approach to map design in large single-player adventures. Released in February, Avowed is the latest epic role-playing fantasy from Obsidian Entertainment, and instead of an open structure, the landscape is divided into a series of smaller segments, which open up consecutively as the story progresses. According to narrative designer Kate Dollarhyde, a key part of this decision was being able to provide a cogent narrative that allowed for more player choice. “Pacing is really tough in open-world games,”she told Xbox Wire. “You never know where the player is and what they’re doing at any given time. So having these zones that happen in sequence means we always know what content you’ve just come from on the critical path.”In short, what the player loses in terms of being able to wander about wherever they like, the developers gain in taking control over how the story proceeds. I enjoyed the structure too because it gave me a very clear idea of how far I’d come – it made a very ambitious title feel manageable.View image in fullscreenSmall enough to feel manageable … the world of Atomfall.Photograph: Rebellion DevelopmentsAnother recent example is Atomfall, apocalyptic postwar thriller from Rebellion Developments in which the player must escape the quarantine zone placed around a disaster at the Windscale nuclear plant. Again, there are four main landscape areas for the player to discover, some of which are subtly locked behind narrative prompts. These spaces are fully explorable – you can wander the woods, explore a little village, clamber down into winding caves – but they’re comparatively small, so it feels like wherever you go, you’re going to find something interesting and relevant. Added to this is the lack of fast travel: you get everywhere on foot, so you really become embedded in these rich spaces – part of the pleasure becomes taking new routes between familiar locations, checking out ruined country mansions, or hidden gorges leading down to trickling streams.It reminded me of how fun it was to play last year’s excellent role-playing adventure Dragon’s Dogma 2, which was more open in design but similarly restricted fast travel across the map, providing only a few teleport sites. In this way, every quest really felt like a quest – something time-consuming, unpredictable and dangerous. The sorts of things games are really about.I wonder what effect the arrival of GTA 6 will have – whether other publishers will feel they should compete or if they’ll just throw their arms up in surrender and head the way of Obsidian and Rebellion. I hope it’s the latter. There’s still so much innovation to be made in contained explorable environments – look at how much interactive variety has been teased from the wonderful Hitman titles: the way that interlocking gameplay systems involving player-character abilities, enemy AI and environmental factors combine to produce rich procedural narratives. I’ve forgotten a lot of the landscape I saw in the Horizon titles but I’ll never forget knocking out a millionaire tech bro with a giant fish.The variety that open-world titles boast about doesn’t just have to come from sheer expanse, it can be much more granular. I’d take an intricately authored village over a vast wilderness any day, because I like to get to know a place. I knew the little town of Silent Hill, I knew the docks of Shenmue. It’s like famous game designer Chappell Roan once put it: I don’t want the world, but I’ll take this city.What to playView image in fullscreenA must-try little puzzler … Cave of Cards.If Balatro has got you really into weird poker games, can I point you towardCave of Cards?

It’sa really nuanced piecewith lots of examples, and I like the way Howitt neatly sums up the Ubisoft school of open-world game design as “travelling to points on a map to build up progress meters”.If you’re waiting for the TV adaptation ofThe Last of Us Part Two, Variety hasa decent interviewwith the actor Pedro Pascal, who portrays Joel, about how he prepared for the five-year gap in the narrative timeline between the games.

But A Working Man is a better Jason Statham title, because who’s better, or at least more reliable, at punching in for duty at the genre factory than Stath? Pushing 60, he’s still throwing those punches, sometimes aided by Jackie Chan-like props, and increasingly aided by those old-guy action-movie crutches of firearms and grenades.Snow White review – Disney’s exhaustingly awful reboot axes the prince and makes the dwarves mo-capRead moreA Working Man is Statham’s insta-follow-up to his biggest hit in years, 2024’s January-movie ideal The Beekeeper; it’s not a sequel, but it’s also directed by David Ayer, extending his break from cops and gangs to send Statham off to combat some more broadly agreed-upon social ills with vaguely QAnon undertones. Last time, Statham fought back against phone scammers and a conspiracy that led all the way to, well, you know; this time, he’s taking on sex trafficking. He’s narrowed his focus, though: There’s one particular act of sex trafficking that really gets his goat. The bad guys have the ill fortune to target Jenny Garcia (Arianna Rivas), the college-aged daughter of Joe (Michael Peña), owner of the construction outfit where Levon Cade (Statham) makes his no-fuss living. Levon is saving up for a lawyer to fight for better custody of his own young daughter, so when Jenny is kidnapped from a bar outing, he reluctantly agrees to dust off the Royal Marine skills that never really went anywhere and track her down. (Joe also offers him a huge sum of cash, a potential boon for his custody battle with his dead wife’s supercilious father.)The movie’s steady supply of working-class posturing is a bit much, even for the genuinely and charmingly rough-hewn Statham. Some of the muchness presumably comes courtesy ofSylvester Stallone, who shares screenwriting credit with Ayer. The result is an unexpected three-way tug of war, gentle but unmistakable, between their three compatible yet distinct sensibilities. There are glimmers of classic Statham action scenes, as when thugs harass employees at a Garcia worksite and Levon takes matters (as well as a bunch of constructional materials) into his own hands. There’s crusty Stallone-style camaraderie in Levon’s friendship with his blind compatriot Gunny (David Harbour, hammy as ever) and his instant chemistry with a tangentially involved gang leader. Two more of the over-many bad guys, meanwhile, feel like they’re wandering in from a bad Ayer remake of The Crow. The movie shifts visual tones and textures from scene to scene, sometimes digital-clear and sometimes 2000s-style grainy, which is both novel and more than a little jarring.Where Stallone and Ayer seem to agree is that Statham torturing and mowing down bad guys is as exciting as him fighting a bunch of henchmen (untrue!) and Jenny especially doesn’t deserve to be sex-trafficked because she’s so tough and self-reliant. (In fact, she often seems more annoyed than truly afraid for her life.) The movie also indulges some weird intimations that Joe, while obviously fitting the “model minority” stereotype to a T, is too soft and weak to truly protect his family, and must outsource the job to unpretentious working-class Levon, who lives a spartan life in his truck before he acquiesces to the lawyer-suggested need for a residence and upgrades to a flophouse. Joe may technically be a widower, but the movie’s divorce-dad energy is off the charts.At its best, a movie like A Working Man functions as an update to the hard-boiled detective story, with a resilient bruiser conducting his own off-books missing-person investigation. There’s a little of that juice as Levon does some amateur undercover work as a drug buyer, cozying up to a motorcycle gang (the aforementioned leader sits on a chrome throne, another touch that feels like Ayer’s doing). But Stallone and Ayer don’t have the patience for too much skullduggery; skullsmashery is more their thing, and as an action movie, A Working Man doesn’t reach the giddy highs of Statham’s best. It spends too much time futzing with its star’s righteous bona fides, and while Statham looks great for his age, his fight sequences become increasingly methodical as the movie goes on, making little use of his trademark athleticism. Some of the movie’s cartoon mayhem is fun enough. The rest feels like, well, work.A Working Man is out in US and UK cinemas on 28 MarchExplore more on these topicsJason StathamSylvester StallonereviewsShareReuse this content"

That makes Andy Kaufman particularly unusual, even this many years later: he is a comedian who worked so hard to raise questions about whether or not he was “on” that those questions lingered well after his death.The creator of characters such as Foreign Man, who would unexpectedly break into a spot-on Elvis impression; Latka Gravas, the sitcom version of that character he did for the beloved show Taxi; the grotesquely abusive lounge singer never-was Tony Clifton; and the misogynist woman-wrestling showboat named, uh, Andy Kaufman constructed so many clever hoaxes to house his work that many assumed he must not actually have died young at the age of 35. (Some of his collaborators insisted on perpetuating that illusion, though his death certificate is widely viewable.)Sex and the smackdown: the crazy world of wrestling cult comic Andy KaufmanRead moreThe newdocumentaryThank You Very Much isn’t strictly necessary to recount Kaufman’s legendary antics. He appears as a major figure in plenty of books and films, whether directly about his own life (including Man on the Moon, for which Jim Carrey inhabited Kaufman so deeply that he hadhis own Netflix documentaryabout his process) or chronicling the institutions he touched along the way (like just about any book covering the history ofSaturday Night Live). Just last fall, Nicholas Braun joined Carrey in playing Kaufman onthe big screen; he recreated the comedian’s famous Mighty Mouse bit, where Kaufman timidly puts on a recording of the Mighty Mouse theme song and gathers the nerve to lip-sync along with a single line, as it appeared on the premiere episode of SNL.What Alex Braverman’s film tackles is the comprehensiveness of the Kaufman project, placing it in a proper and personal context. Kaufman, a longtime practitioner of transcendental meditation, seemed to find a form of spiritual enlightenment in his commitment as a comedian, and clearly put a lot of thought into this aspect of his work. (There’s even footage of a young Kaufman asking Maharishi Mahesh Yogi whether achieving a kind of inner peace would eliminate the need for entertainment and entertainers.) Perhaps more so than the entertaining but somewhat conventional Carrey-starring biopic, Thank You Very Much is also upfront about how alienating Kaufman could be – to audience members, to casual observers, even to co-workers – while at the same time never framing his work as pure endurance tests. There’s an evident glee in his blurring the lines between reality and fiction, even when he does his best to hide it under voices or makeup.Thank You Very Much doesn’t depend on the same old clips, and watching all of this Kaufman footage emphasizes how inimitable the man was. Eventually, his performance-art take on comedy does start to reveal some descendants, if somewhat superficial ones. Kaufman’s Foreign Man shtick feels like it might have influenced earlyAdam Sandler, when his bizarre little voices and bursts of nonsense might have made audiences wonder if this is a near-amateur or a polished professional having a laugh (and in a way, it was both, though even early on, Sandler would give himself away with endearing little breaks in the facade). The later work of Tim Heidecker, where he plays “himself” in the ongoing (and weirdly intricate) On Cinema series and in a standup special that spoofs hacky comics by convincingly performing a certain type of familiar routine, has a clear Kaufman influence as well; it similarly requires more than passive consumption in order to fully appreciate the joke.View image in fullscreenAndy Kaufman performs on stage in 1978.Photograph: Paul Natkin/Getty ImagesWhat’s more difficult to replicate is Kaufman’s dedication to his strangest whims. (When Tim Heidecker passes away, it will probably not kick off a 30-year ambiguity over whether he’s genuinely dead.) The closest we have to that is something weirder and scarier, a kind of inverse to Kaufman’s thoughtful deception. In place of comedians who prompt the audience to wonder whether or not to take him at face value, it is far more common to see comedians who prod their audience to question the very nature of reality around them, but with comedians as their truth-telling, regular folks, and essentially trustworthy guides. The most obvious example, of course, is Joe Rogan, who “admits” to not being an expert while using his approachability to steer his audience in the direction of rejecting medical science or promoting baseless conspiracy theories. But the flipping of Kaufman’s brilliant gambits, where uncertainty about reality remains but the comedian is your trusted guide through that uncertainty, could apply to any number of comedians who cultivate parasocial relationships with their loyal listeners. It’s like a lazy man’s version of Kaufman: all the questioning, none of the performance.This allows the comedian to risk little while amassing followers; Kaufman repeatedly risked his reputation – as well as whatever following he had gathered from Taxi or SNL. It’s wild to consider that in 1982, Kaufman participated in a bit on SNL that had audience members calling in to decide whether he would continue to pop up on the show. He lost the vote, appeared once more, never again – despite the fact that some of his colleagues in the doc claim that he was double-crossed by producer Dick Ebersol, who had grown tired of his antics. You’d never know either away from Kaufman himself. Today, it’s far more common for comedians to simply court a persecution complex.There’s a lovely clip showcased in Thank You Very Much where Kaufman offers a rare reassurance to his audience: “Don’t be afraid of what you don’t know.” Today, that kind of mantra might have an entirely different meaning, used to promote a false sense of expertise from entertainers: don’t hesitate to speak up about topics you know less than nothing about! Given that, the way Kaufman was able to use the unknown as the existential engine of his entire career now seems all the more miraculous.Thank You Very Much is out in US cinemas on 28 March with a UK date to be announcedExplore more on these topicsComedyDocumentary filmsSaturday Night LiveTV comedyTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A restored print is showing in London this monthRyan GilbeyWed 26 Mar 2025 05.40 EDTLast modified on Wed 26 Mar 2025 08.03 EDTShareYou never forget your first visit to Café Flesh. Mine took place in June 1986: it was a month before my 15th birthday and I was spending Saturday afternoon, as I often did, at the notorious Scala cinema in tawdry, pre-gentrified King’s Cross. I don’t know which staff member thought it appropriate to allow an acne-peppered child in to see the post-apocalyptic sex fantasy Café Flesh – in a double-bill with the equally explicit hardcore horror-comedy Thundercrack! – but I’m glad they did.When I emerged blinking into the early evening sunlight, I had witnessed sights that few 14-year-olds could have imagined. The movie is set in a desolate future where “the Nuclear Kiss” has left 99% of the population unable to enjoy intimacy without becoming nauseous. These are the Sex Negatives. The remaining 1%, known as Sex Positives, are forced to perform for the chaste, dead-eyed masses. They grind away joylessly on stage to a jazzy but sinister electronic score by Mitchell Froom, who went on to be a producer for Paul McCartney, Crowded House and Suzanne Vega (to whom he was briefly married).The film’s on-stage performances, featuring real sex, play like radioactive mutations of porn cliche. A bored housewife has sex with a milkman, except that here he is dressed as a rat, complete with snout and obscenely swishing tail. In another scene, a secretary is mounted on the desk by her boss, who happens to have a giant yellow pencil in place of a head. Debbie Does Dallas this is not. A twisted masterpiece it may well be.Porn audiences in the US loathed the film during its initial run in 1982. But once it transferred a year later to the midnight movie circuit – the same place that had made hits of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Pink Flamingos and Eraserhead – it really found its people. Hunter S Thompson loved it, as did Frank Zappa. It later influenced the artist Dinos Chapman and the horror maestro Rob Zombie. Vera Drew, award-winning director of The People’s Joker, recently confessed: “I will be rewatching this movie (and probably ripping it off) for the rest of my life.” Who can blame her? The film’s production design is slick and debased, gleaming and corroded, wreathed in smoke and style. It blends a 1980s ad-agency gloss with 1950s Americana, as well as an atmosphere of nuclear dread applicable to both decades.With the movie about to re-emerge in a new restored print, I email its director Stephen Sayadian. To avoid potential prosecution, he was listed in the credits of Café Flesh as Rinse Dream, a pseudonym suggested by his co-writer, Jerry Stahl, who is billed as Herbert W Day (the name of Stahl’s most despised primary school teacher). Sayadian, now 71, is amused to learn that I witnessed his warped vision at such a tender age. “Next to you, I’m a passenger on the Good Ship Lollipop,” he says.View image in fullscreen‘The structure is the same as the old musicals’ … poster for Café Flesh (1982).The allusion to Shirley Temple and the golden age of Hollywood is typical of him. When we connect via video call a few days later, the director, who sports a crown of wild silver hair, is speaking from the office in his Chicago home; the walls around him are papered with a floor-to-ceiling collage, painstakingly applied by hand, of cultural icons dating back to the silent film era. Café Flesh pays homage to Guys and Dolls, Cabaret and the Fred Astaire musical The Band Wagon. “The structure of pornography is the same as the old musicals,” Sayadian says. “You’d have scenes punctuated by musical numbers that weren’t necessarily related: it was Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland putting on a show.” Nothing like the one in Café Flesh, that’s for sure.Stahl, who went on to write for TV series such as Moonlighting and the alien sitcom ALF, and later had his Hollywood addiction memoir Permanent Midnight adapted into a film starring Ben Stiller, has described Café Flesh as a “fuck you” to pornography. Sayadian saw it more as a cinematic calling card: a chance to parlay his reputation as a supreme visual stylist into a film career.Since the mid-1970s, Sayadian had worked at the counter-cultural porn magazine Hustler, where the owner Larry Flynt gave him carte blanche to create elaborate spoof ads. Among his best was the savage, double-page big-tobacco parody showing a hospital ward full of Marlboro cowboys in iron lungs, or the witty Dunkin’ Dildos, in which sex toys were laid out like doughnuts.After leaving Hustler, setting up his own studio and designing posters for movies including The Fog and Dressed to Kill, Sayadian was offered the chance by a porn company to move into film-making. His first effort, the stylishly kinky Nightdreams, was financed with the loose change from peep shows; its entire $60,000 budget came in the form of socks full of quarters. Café Flesh was more ambitious. Shot over 10 days for $90,000 – paper money, this time – it allowed Sayadian’s imagination full reign.What did the porn performers think of his outlandish ideas, such as the pencil-headed boss and the rodent milkman? “This was all so new to them, they couldn’t believe it,” he laughs. His technique of cutting abruptly from fully clothed wide shots to explicit closeups was also unconventional. “I wanted to get the sex over with as quickly as possible. Whenever the actors got passionate, I’d stop the take and start again. I thought: if this is a future where they’re being forced to do it, maybe they wouldn’t enjoy it any more.” That’s the one thing he would change about the film if he could. “I’d make it more erotic. Those scenes are really a trudge to get through.”Jane Giles, who co-directed last year’s hit documentaryScala!!!, begs to differ. She saw Café Flesh as an audience member, then became the Scala’s programmer in 1988 and helped make it one of the cinema’s most frequently screened films. “After that first run in 1986, it was withdrawn from exhibition because local councils were getting queasy about showing films that didn’t have BBFC certificates,” she recalls. “Then when Camden council agreed for the first time in years to let the Scala show it again, there were queues around the block. I think it’s a really sexy film. There’s one character who’s a newcomer to sex. She’s like, ‘Oh my God, this is great!’ That was how I felt as a horny teenager. You discover sex and you think, ‘I want to keep doing this for ever!’”When the film’s financiers saw what Sayadian had made, they were aghast. “They hadn’t read the script,” he says. “My favourite comment was: ‘It’s like you took a perfect pair of breasts and wrapped them in a barbed wire bra.’” Café Flesh lasted less than a week at California’s Pussycat chain of adult cinemas before being pulled. “The movie theatres were asking: ‘What did you do to us?’ Customers were demanding their money back.”View image in fullscreenCafé Flesh.Photograph: Stephen SayadianPerhaps they took umbrage at their on-screen portrayal. Every sex scene includes cutaways to the crowd of pallid Sex Negatives gawping at pleasures they can no longer experience first-hand. It’s quite the buzz-kill. “Some of those extras came from scouring methadone clinics,” he says. “We’d drag people up to my studio and pay them $30 for 30 seconds’ filming.”As well as serving as a commentary on porn and voyeurism, Café Flesh distils the obsessions of its era, from 1950s nostalgia (seen in other 1980s films such as Blue Velvet, Parents and Back to the Future) to nuclear terror and Aids. “When Jerry and I began writing the script, the word ‘Aids’ didn’t exist,” says Sayadian. “Then people started talking about a ‘gay plague’. I knew this was an infectioneveryonewas going to be vulnerable to, and I saw how it could work as part of the film. I even wanted to include a boy-boy scene but that was a no-no in heterosexual porn. The other one back then was African American performers. The racism, sexism and homophobia was really something. Porn is the most conservative business I was ever in.”The revelation for me seeing Café Flesh again for the first time in nearly 40 years is that it isn’t a porn film at all. As Danny Peary, author of the Cult Movies books, has written: “It is the rare XXX-rated film where graphic sex is not gratuitous, but necessary to the plot.” In that way, it feels perfectly in tune with the modern explicitness of Stranger By the Lake,Théo & Hugoand the cheerfully transgressive work ofBruce LaBruce. Giles is glad to see the film back again but hesitates when I ask how she thinks it will go down with audiences today. “I’m sure they’ll be surprised by all the big hairy muffs,” she says.Café Flesh is screening at the ICA cinema, London, on 29 March.This article was amended on 26 March 2025. An earlier version used a still from the film Dr Caligari as the main picture, rather than Café Flesh.Explore more on these topicsFilmPornographyScience fiction and fantasy filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But, ahead of the Black British book festival (BBBF) this weekend, a number of Black literary figures say there has been a noticeable downward shift in the number of Black writers being published.View image in fullscreenSelina Brown.Photograph: Spenser McPhersonSelina Brown, who founded BBBF in 2021, said the number of Black authors being pitched to her has dropped dramatically in the last 18 months. She also believes the number of books being published by Black writers has “plummeted”.“Some publishers were saying ‘we don’t have anything to give you’. Publishers are now seeing diverse authors as a ‘risk’, so Black and brown authors aren’t being taken on,” Brown said.Other prominent voices within the British publishing industry – where only about 3% of the workforce are Black, according to figures from the Publishers Association (PA) – noted a surge in interest in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, then a subsequent dip.Sharmaine Lovegrove, cultural strategist at Hachette UK, one of the country’s leading publishing houses, co-foundedThe Black Writers’ Guildand established Hachette’s Dialogue imprint, which focuses on books by, about and for marginalised communities. She said things are harder for new Black authors now than they were pre-2020.“We didn’t think we couldn’t go so far so quickly, and go back to where we started,” said Lovegrove. “I think it’s harder because people will say ‘well, we tried’. When people say ‘we tried’ they’re reluctant to do that again and that’s heartbreaking.”Lovegrove said the industry hasn’t been able to build new, diverse audiences and struggled to talk and cater to Black authors who were often labelled “difficult” for advocating for themselves.View image in fullscreen‘The biggest mistake was seeing it as a trend’ … Sharmaine Lovegrove.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The ObserverShe said: “The biggest mistake was seeing it as a trend as opposed to an opportunity to cultivate something meaningful that was missing.”“It’s as if the industry is saying: ‘It’s all very difficult and these books haven’t done very well so we’re literally not going to try again with someone from the same background’,” she added. “It’s the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”A report by PA found that “ethnic minority” representation across the industry fell from 17% to 15% in 2024, with a decline in the numbers of Asian and British Asian staff. The number of Black staff remained at about 3% during the same period.There have been success stories. After selling more than a million copies ofWhy I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race, Reni Eddo-Lodgelaunched her Monument Books imprintat HarperCollins last year, with the specific goal of finding writers “who can help us understand our past, navigate our present and map new futures”.Bristolian writerMoses McKenziehas won critical acclaim and awards. Other authors including Emma Dabiri, Yomi Adegoke, David Olusoga and Afua Hirsch have all had impressive sales figures and built international profiles.The Black British book festival has also been expanding: it runs a community library in London and plans to open another this year; it has collaborated with Glastonbury festival; it launched a children’s book festival in Birmingham, which was headlined by Lenny Henry earlier this month, and has planned higher education courses.But Brown says the impetus of 2020 has faded and new Black authors have often seen their books marketed the same way as other authors despite publishers speaking of wanting to “reach new audiences”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

It can’t work. You cannot have a one size fits all approach to every book.”Lemara Lindsay-Prince, who was in charge at Stormzy’s Penguin Random House imprint #Merky Books before she left to set up her ownliterary studiofor authors, said that convincing stakeholders across a publishing division’s sales and marketing teams was at times very challenging.She said: “People always think it’s this editor, author, agent matrix that prohibits global majority voices getting published and that’s not always the case: it’s sales, marketing, publicity, international sales, and rights. It isn’t inclusive enough and because of that many people don’t see the value in a global majority voice.”Majority of UK children’s books with Black main characters written by white authors, study findsRead more“When people tell me they want to be an editor, I say don’t – go work in sales,” she added. “That’s where the critical part of the conversation is happening. Editorial can have the vision but if the people who hold the purse strings don’t value Black and brown voices then you’re in trouble.”Agencies such asDark Matter, which focuses on linking publishers and authors with Black audiences, have had success recently butanalysis by the Bookseller in 2023found that the boom in Black authors being published after 2020 “failed to result in the promised broadening of publishing’s output”.Brown said she established BBBF because there was an obvious gap in the market for a festival that catered to Black readers. Her instinct has been proven correct with successful events in Manchester, her home town of Birmingham and a sell-out last year at the Barbican in London where R&B star Eve headlined.This year’s festival takes place atManchester Central Libraryon 29 March. Its lineup, which features Kehinde Andrews, Kit de Waal, Jeffrey Boakye and DJ Paulette, is expected to bring in more than 2,500 people.Brown says the industry needs to change how it measures success for diverse authors. “The fact that an author is sat on a panel in some conference and their influence is having an impact on people – that’s important,” she said. “Yes, the bottom line is financial but we need to have different benchmarks.”Explore more on these topicsBooksBlack British cultureFestivalsPublishingnewsShareReuse this content"

It also stars Frances Fisher and Travis Fimmel.It is described as “a heartfelt and emotional story forged in the struggles of the new frontier”.Baldwin was charged with manslaughter after a prop gun killed Hutchins and injured the film’s writer-director Joel Souza. The case was dismissed last July for Baldwin but the armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed is serving an 18-month sentence for her role.The film was later completed andpremieredlast November at the Camerimage cinematography festival in Torun, Poland. It is dedicated to Hutchins.“We are here because we want to honour her,” Souza said at the premiere. “We want to showcase her work. We want it not to just disappear.”Vulture’s Nick Newmancalledit “a work of salutary effect and simple pleasure saturated in morbid curiosity”.Earlier this month a documentary was released on Hulu calledLast Take: Rust and the Story of Halynawhich looked back at both Hutchins and the accident. “She absolutely would have become a household name as a cinematographer,” the film’s director, Rachel Mason, said to the Guardian. “Anyone who knew her had absolutely no doubt she was going to be on the highest level, winning awards, becoming well-known for that.”The film drew some criticism upon premiering for its focus on the death of Hutchins over her life and career. “I hoped it might have a little more Halyna in it or been a little more about Halyna,” Souza said.Mason told the Guardian that the shift was inevitable with each new development. “As we were working on the film, the story kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger,” she said. “There was more news, there were trials, and there were things that I couldn’t have imagined when I first started. I just wanted to focus entirely on Halyna and her body of work, the people that she knew and she worked with, and not so much on Rust.”Baldwin has since led a reality show on TLC that follows the life of himself and his family. The Guardian’s Lucy Mangancalledit “a new low for television”.The actor will next star in the Italian Christmas movie Kid Santa alongside his brother William. The film comes from the director of Sherlock Santa, Vote for Santa and The Good Witch of Christmas.Rust will be released on 2 May in the US.Explore more on these topicsAlec BaldwinRust film set shootingWesternsnewsShareReuse this content"

The law, Senate File 496, was first approved by Iowa’s Republican-led legislature and governor Kim Reynolds in 2023, however, Locher placed an injunction on it in December 2023 after authors and publishers sued the state.The preliminary injunction was reversed by the US Eighth Circuit appeals court last August, leading publishers and authors to file a second complaint, arguing that the ban violates free speech and “goes far beyond prohibiting books that are obscene as to minors because it prohibits books with even a brief description of a sex act for students of all ages without any evaluation of the book as a whole”.In his decision, Locher wrote that the ban has resulted in “forced removal of books from school libraries that are not pornographic or obscene”, and that unconstitutional applications of the law “far exceed” constitutional applications.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Publisher-led lawsuits have also been brought inFloridaandIdaho.Other books unconstitutionally caught up in the law, wrote Locher, include Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut, Song of Solomon and The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison, and Looking for Alaska and The Fault in Our Stars byJohn Green.Explore more on these topicsBooksJohn GreenJodi PicoultIowanewsShareReuse this content"

He faces up to five years in prison and a fine of €75,000 (£63,000) if convicted of the offences.Depardieu denies any wrongdoing, telling the court this week: “I deny all of it.”The woman employed as third assistant film director has not been named in the media. She was tasked with accompanying Depardieu from his dressing room on to the set during the filming.She told the court a first sexual assault happened during a night shoot in Paris, when she found herself alone with Depardieu at the end of a short road where his dressing room was located as they walked towards an outdoor set.She said she felt his hand on her buttock. “It happened by surprise; I was shocked. I didn’t know how to react … I carried on as if nothing had happened, kept walking to the set. I had a knot in my stomach.”She said the second assault happened at a later date on a set inside a Paris apartment, where Depardieu blocked her against a door and put his two hands on her breasts. She told the court: “I said no. I was scared.” She said that on a third occasion Depardieu put his hand on her buttocks and she again said: “No.”The assistant director told the court that before this, Depardieu “talked about sex all day on set, constantly talking of ‘pussy’ to everyone”. She said: “He listens a lot, observes everyone, listens to everything and uses it later to humiliate everyone. At the time, I was having a difficult separation. I’d spoken to someone about it, so he mocked me for it. There were lewd comments, humiliations; it was an unhealthy environment.”She said she felt ashamed of what Depardieu had done and did not want to speak out because she wanted to continue working on the film and handle the situation herself. But when her direct superior asked how she was getting on with Depardieu, she told her all that had happened.The assistant director said that, after this, Depardieu shouted at her that she was a “snitch” and he was “odious” to her on set, calling her “crazy”.She said Depardieu later said “sorry” to her in an angry way in front of other crew members. She said Depardieu said he did not want her coming to collect him from his dressing room any longer.She said: “On the set I felt huge anxiety, stress, shame, guilt; it was very difficult.”Asked by the head judge what she wanted from the trial, the assistant director said: “I want us to hear the truth and stop minimising what happened.”Depardieu denied sexual assault. “I did not touch her buttocks, I did not touch her breasts, I did none of that,” he said.He told the court: “I’m not like that. I can’t be like that … I’ve never of my own will touched a buttock like that, even furtively. It wouldn’t cross my mind.”Asked by the complainant’s lawyer about the allegations of touching the woman’s buttocks he said: “I didn’t sexually assault. A sexual assault is more serious than that I think.”Asked to clarify, he said he didn’t know what sexual assault was.He said that at the time, he couldn’t walk 150 metres in the street on his own because of his health, weight and joint troubles. He said he was almost always accompanied by a bodyguard or aides on the film set, and was never alone with an assistant director.Depardieu said of the assistant director:“I think that maybe, I don’t know, she was wary because of my reputation of being vulgar, crude, rude,” Depardieu said. “But I’m not only that. I still respect people.”He said he was not someone “who touches people”.He said that he had later asked the production to make sure it was a man who collected him from his dressing room instead of a woman because he always made lewd comments in his dressing room and didn’t want women to be shocked if they overheard them.He said: “I’m crude and vulgar. I say things that can shock young people.” He told the court that on a previous film he’d said: “Bring me a man who’s not shocked by my language,” and: “Stop putting in girls who are shocked by what I say.”He denied shouting at the assistant director.The French actor Fanny Ardant, a close friend of Depardieu, testified in his support. She said she had never witnessed any inappropriate gestures by him in a long career working together.She appeared in Les Volets Verts but was not on set at the time of the alleged sexual assaults.She called Depardieu an incredible actor and a “genius”, saying “all forms of genius carries within it something extravagant, unsubmissive”.Ardant said: “Yes, he takes up space on set; yes, he has a big mouth, says crude things, likes to play the idiot on a set because people will then be less afraid of his personality ... I knowGérard Depardieu, I’ve heard his shouting, his cries of anger, his provocations ... but I have never witnessed a gesture I found shocking.”Leaving the stand, she approached Depardieu, embraced him and kissed him on the cheek.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsGérard DepardieuFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It currently receives £344,206 a year.Last year, Gilhooly launched a fund which aimed to make the Wigmore Hall financially self-sustaining in “an uncertain public environment for classical music in the UK”.The venue hoped to raise £10m by 2027, but has reached its target early. It said in a statement: “Providing long-term financial security, the fund allows Wigmore Hall to remain ambitious and artistically bold while retaining its independence.”Wigmore Hall also received a £500,000 grant from the AKO Foundation, which the venue said would enable its scheme to provide £5 tickets for concertgoers under 35 to continue for a further five years.It also announced its season for the following year, including performances by musicians such as Rhiannon Giddens, baritone Matthias Goerne and Simon Russell Beale interpreting the life of Debussy with pianist Lucy Parham.Explore more on these topicsWigmore HallClassical musicArts Council EnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

But it is a smart, nuanced documentary that blossoms into something profoundRebecca NicholsonWed 26 Mar 2025 18.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 26 Mar 2025 18.02 EDTShareThere is a neat trick, used sparingly but to great effect, in Rose Ayling-Ellis: Old Hands New Tricks. According to the Royal National Institute for Deaf People, 80% of adults over the age of 70 will have some hearing loss. To demonstrate what this loss might be like for hearing viewers, the programme-makers amplify the background noise until it obfuscates the conversations that are taking place. The point is made simply and well.Ayling-Ellis made her name as an actor on EastEnders, but became something of a national treasure when she won Strictly Come Dancing, as the programme’s first deaf contestant. Her sensational Couple’s Choice dance with Giovanni Pernice, in which the music cut out while the dance continued in silence, is one of the show’s all-time great moments.Initial uptake for the classes is low, and the attendees are late. ‘They’re a tough crowd,’ says Ayling-EllisIn this charming, intelligent and emotional two-part documentary, she makes a hard sell for what she says is her passion project: teaching British sign language (BSL) to older people who may be struggling with hearing loss. She explains that she understands the frustration of not being able to hear what people are saying around her, and repeatedly emphasises the importance of being understood, connected and included. Sign language, she thinks, can be helpful, not just for the profoundly deaf but for people who may be losing their hearing, too. In order to test her theory, she persuades the residents of a retirement village in Buckinghamshire to embark on a pilot scheme with her.Hughenden Gardens Village is not a regular retirement home; it’s a cool one. It looks a bit like a hot-desking office crossed with a brand new school or hospital, and there are more than 300 older people living there, with an average age of 80. One resident describes it as “a combination of a hotel and a holiday camp”, which seems about right. Ayling-Ellis is filled with enthusiasm when she arrives, but it is to the credit of this series, and the benefit of its narrative arc, that setting up BSL classes for the residents proves quite a bit trickier than she expected.She is nervous before she delivers the pitch to residents, and fumbles it. The initial response is far from positive; one woman points out that she is 101, and therefore too old to learn new skills. Ayling-Ellis appeases her, says she isn’t. “I’m not really interested, you know,” the woman replies, not unkindly, but firmly nonetheless. Belinda, the friendly village manager, suggests that they put a six-week limit on the course. “They can be quite forgetful,” she explains.View image in fullscreen‘A combination of a hotel and a holiday camp’ … Rose Ayling-Ellis and residents of Hughenden Gardens Village in Old Hands, New Tricks.Photograph: Ricky Darko/BBC/Rogan ProductionsInitial uptake for the classes is low, and the attendees are late. “They’re a tough crowd,” says Ayling-Ellis. But she is not put off, and the fact that the BSL classes take place at all are a combination of tenacity and sheer belief. She calls upon a charismatic BSL teacher, Marios Costi, to tutor them, and he proves more than up to the task. And of course, while some of the early mishaps are lightly funny, it blossoms into something beautiful and profound.We learn more about the Hughenden residents, and their loves and losses. At times, it becomes a meditation on not just mortality, but what it means to live life with purpose and dignity, and how we might start to resist loneliness. Eric has been married to June for 69 years. She has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, and Eric says he no longer speaks to many people because he struggles to hear in crowds. He comes out of his shell in the BSL classes, to his daughter’s astonishment.This is more than a fairytale, however. It is nuanced and smart. Ayling-Ellis explains that she has mixed feelings about hearing aids, which many older people come to rely on; she says they are seen as a panacea, when that isn’t really the case. Learning BSL offers a more expressive way to communicate and, in turn, that reduces the risk of isolation, not feeling understood and not fitting in.There are many moving moments in which we see the possibilities. Sue is losing her sight. She needs to learn braille, but admits she is scared that she is too old to do it. Ayling-Ellis takes her to meet Michael, who was born deaf, then lost his sight, and now communicates with hands-on signing. He tells her not to give up. I have a lump in my throat.The wider point is that BSL can, and must, be learned by more people than those with hearing loss. Here, you see how it can spread. The village staff begin to learn it. Eric’s grandchildren show off a few words. If it works as well on everyone else as it does on me, viewers should come away with at least a few new words for themselves, too.Rose Ayling-Ellis: Old Hands New Tricks aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewRose Ayling-EllisTelevisionDeafness and hearing lossOlder peoplereviewsShareReuse this content"

The fundamentals of this scene are familiar – you’ve probably watched something like it in a film, or dreamed about it happening to you; perhaps it already has. But Sara lives in a new world, several decades in the future, and she is being arrested because Scout, the state’s AI security system, has flagged something irregular inside her mind.Sara seems unexceptional: she’s a museum archivist, married and mother to young twins. She once had an argument with her husband Elias after he impulsively part-exchanged the family Toyota for a Volvo. Sara sees herself as a person who “couldn’t possibly be considered a member of the lawbreaking classes”, until the moment at the airport when an officer informs her that her “risk score” is too high, and sends her to Madison, a California women’s retention centre housed in a former elementary school. At Madison, a record of good behaviour will lower her score; however, this record lies in the hands of her guards. She is not sufficiently subordinate, and can’t get her number down.“Retainees” are held initially for 21 days, then on a rolling basis, potentially for ever. This isn’t punishment but risk management, for anybody considered likely to commit a crime. Every citizen has a risk score, extrapolated via algorithm from personal cloud data, from surveillance networks, and from the Dreamsaver – a widely used skull implant that delivers more restful sleep. The small print of Dreamsaver Inc grants the company rights to share the user’s dreams with the government. People are OK with this; it seems to have reduced terrorism.The Dream Hotel has a burning quality, both in its swift, consuming escalation and in the clarity and purpose of what it showsThe Dream Hotel is Laila Lalami’s fifth novel – earlier works received nominations for the Booker, Pulitzer and National book awards – and has been longlisted for the Women’s prize. Her 2020 nonfiction book, Conditional Citizens, draws on her experiences as a Moroccan American to think about her adopted country’s two-tier system: how rights and freedoms are, in practice, exercised very differently across race, class, gender and national origin. Lalami’s fiction has explored the way these differences play out across a range of times and places: from Hope and Other Dangerous Pursuits (2005), on migrant experiences in modern Morocco, toThe Moor’s Account(2014), inspired by the true story of a 16th-century Black man who survived a notorious Spanish colonial expedition to the Americas. Her most recent novel, 2019’sThe Other Americans, is set in California in the shadow of the Iraq war, and follows the causes and repercussions of the moment when Driss, a Moroccan immigrant, is killed at an intersection by a speeding car.In The Dream Hotel, Lalami turns to the future. The novel is especially interesting as a vision of how AI could weave itself into the two-tier system that she has described and reimagined in earlier works. Sara contrasts the apparent neutrality of Scout’s “new era of digital policing” with the racist treatment her Moroccan immigrant parents received at US airports during her childhood. However, familiar prejudices are built into new tools, which search for specific deviations from an enforced norm. Some bad arguments and weird dreams, a relative who has been in prison and a history of drug use are enough for conviction. Sara’s medical notes link to a record documenting that she was the victim of a sexual assault when she was 19. This adds three points to her risk score.Reading The Dream Hotel is a physical experience: it’s rare for a novel to induce so strong a sense of powerlessness and frustration. Like many technologies, Lalami’s AI renders its users, from the individual to the state, simultaneously smarter and more stupid. It harvests vast quantities of data, then fundamentally misunderstands it. Meanwhile retainees’ hearings are randomly deferred; visits denied; phone calls cut off and overcharged; privacies invaded. “Prison is a place beyond shame.” Sara gradually absorbs the reality that she has become one of the people the state can punish. She dispatches emails of complaint to an interface whose blank replies denote impunity: “We are working to resolve service disruptions”; “This ticket is marked as resolved.”In this sharp, sophisticated novel of forecasts and insightful takes, what I found most powerful was the great bewilderment that the characters share. Lalami traces the upheaval of AI through systems and structures into personal lives, close relationships and quiet thoughts. Sara privately questions whether she has a hidden potential for violence. An interlude at the centre of the novel follows a tech executive who is straining to make sense of her vast yet miserable power.Perhaps you wouldn’t ordinarily pick up a novel in search of an experience of confusion. But The Dream Hotel has a burning quality, both in its swift, consuming escalation – you can’t look away – and in the clarity and purpose of what it shows. Sara is drawn into the bizarre logic through which imprisonment and a two-tier system make one another make sense. “She must’ve done something,” says one new retainee of a longtime resident. “I mean, if they’rekeepingher here this long, then they must have something on her.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Mingled with the recollection of our own life stories, we humans also carry those of others, told or sometimes concealed by those we once knew, or even never met. But what is passed down becomes ours too. This interwoven fabric of past, present and future is the rewarding inspiration behind Michael Zev Gordon’s compelling and intelligent new concert piece,A Kind of Haunting.Gordon’s substantial setting is for two narrators, baritone and string orchestra. Premiered by theBritten Sinfoniaunder Jonathan Berman, it proves true to its title. The score explores Gordon’s search for his Polish Jewish ancestors, murdered in the Holocaust in 1941: an event of which Gordon’s own father barely spoke, and which the composer and his own children now own too. The focus is on the haunting not just the horror. As Gordon says, the work explores the potency of the Holocaust’s aftereffects – a gift and a curse, as Marianne Hirsch’s narration has it.Gordon’s music is deceptively fragmentary. It starts with a shard of lullaby which disappears and reappears without crystalising. Other patterns and phrases recur and rebuild. But the structure is always clear and controlled. There is a strong focus on text, suggesting Gordon does not want the music to become too overwhelming. Occasionally it feels a little too restrained for what is being described, but Gordon’s artistic tact pays dividends in the final pages. One narrator, the excellent Allan Corduner, depicts the search. The second, Louisa Clein, reflects, equally convincingly, on the meaning of the interwoven memories. James Newby brings vocalism of great nuance and controlled solemnity to five reflective arias of mounting intensity to texts by the poet Jacqueline Saphra.The opening half of the concert brought two contrasting masterworks of the Holocaust era itself. Under Berman, the Sinfonia played Martinů’s Concerto for double string orchestra, piano and timpani with full toned ferocity. One had to remind oneself that the concerto, with Huw Watkins a formidable piano soloist, was written in 1938, before the events it otherwise seems to embody so strongly. Strauss’s Metamorphosen, premiered in 1946, is a work of an altogether different kind, with violinist Zoë Beyers leading the 23 string players in a performance whose intimacy captured the veteran composer’s vast sense of loss.This concert will be broadcast onBBC Radio 3on 9 AprilThe Britten Sinfonia: 1945: A Kind of Hauntingis at Elgar Concert Hall, Birmingham on 26 March and Saffron Hall, Saffron Walden on 28 MarchThis article was amended on 26 March 2025.

The chair of Continental Studios, Griffin Mill (Bryan Cranston) is keen to deliver a decisive blow with the hammer of his newly acquired IP. Because “if Warner Bros can make a billion dollars off the plastic tits of a pussyless doll, we should be able to make TWO billion off the legacy brand of Kool-Aid.” He has just fired his long-serving studio head, Patty Leigh (Catherine O’Hara), for her preference for art and is on the verge of promoting studio executive Matt Remick (Seth Rogen) to the big job. What’s a guy – even if he is a devoted cinephile who dreams of adding his contribution to the illustrious roll call of meaningful movies, even if Patty has been his friend and mentor for years – to do? He kisses the ring, takes the job and grabs the Kool-Aid man by the hand. And with that we are off to the races for 10 fast, furious and farcical episodes of Rogen’s new Hollywood satire The Studio, created with his partner since their Superbad-minting days, Evan Goldberg.Can Matt make a Kool-Aid movie that satisfies his inner cineaste and the gaping studio money maw? Why, it certainly seems so when Martin Scorsese (played, inimitably, by Martin Scorsese) turns out to have a script about just that subject! Well, indirectly about just that subject. Actually about the Jonestown massacre, whose 918 victims are supposed to have killed themselves by drinking … yes, you guessed it! And starring Steve Buscemi as Jim Jones. This is going to work out great.View image in fullscreenIke Barinholtz, Kathryn Hahn, Chase Sui Wonders and Seth Rogen in The StudioPhotograph: Apple TV+It does for viewers. The ensuing catastrophe unfolds beautifully, every small decision setting off a cascade of worsening consequences (“Why do you keep lying!” “I don’t know!”) until we arrive, awash with adrenaline and horror, on the far shore, 40 hectic minutes later, as Scorsese sobs on Charlize Theron’s shoulder. “I was so much happier two weeks ago when I was just angry and resentful that I didn’t have this job,” says Matt. The second episode, which plays out in a single take – as a director frantically tries to capture a vital scene in its own single take, as Matt’s presence on set distracts everyone – would make Brian Rix proud, though the more farce-averse among you may have to take a Valium to get through it.Many things mark The Studio out from the ever-increasing herd of satires on Hollywood. There is the unimpeachable casting, from core to cameos; the former comprising not just O’Hara as the raw-nerved Patty but also Kathryn Hahn as permanently, incandescently furious marketing maven Maya, Chase Sui Wonders as the assistant Matt promotes to creative executive (“I thought you only said that so I wouldn’t quit!” “I did. But I also meant it,”) and, perhaps most gloriously, Ike Barinholtz as coke-snorting creative exec Sal Saperstein (“I don’t mean this to sound crass,” he says of Matt’s Jonestown plans, “but I feel like I’ve been double-stuffed by Walt Disney and Aaron Sorkin.” “Thanks?” says Matt). And of course there’s Rogen himself, who wisely makes Matt an everyman, whatever his exalted professional status may be – in thrall to celebrity despite himself, desperately keen to be liked in a job which demands that he make hateful decisions every day, and as susceptible as flattery as any of us – even if he is still, by Hollywood standards at least, a pretty good guy. And all the cameos manage that rare thing – earning their place, from Ron Howard to Zac Efron via Theron, Scorsese, Anthony Mackie, Paul Dano, Olivia Wilde and more, playing up to and around the images we have of them and seemingly having a great time doing it.The Studio trailer – videoThere are enough insider jokes to keep film nerds and keen observers of the Hollywood ecosystem happy, as wheels within wheels turn, backs are stabbed, favours are secretly traded, positions jockeyed for and bums endlessly licked, and enough good jokes to prevent the rest of us feeling shut out or short-changed.You mustn’t come to The Studio looking for much hugging or learning. Emotional abruption, not growth, is the name of the game. Matt does have a better self in there somewhere, but it never stands a chance. Yours wouldn’t either if you had Maya screaming in your face all day, and Buscemi’s face filling with disgust when he realises what you’ve done to Marty. But watching a man’s better angels forever drowning in a rising tide of venality is always fun, is it not? And it sells.The Studio is on Apple TV+ now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionSeth RogenTV comedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Newborns enter the world vulnerable in ways that might be avoided if the gestation period were longer. Scientists long held the belief that this foreshortening was due to an evolutionary trade-off between the brain size of the child and hip-width of the mother. More recently, research has suggested that the explanation lies in energy, not geometry. When the energy demands of a foetus reach roughly double those expended by a mother at rest, a threshold is passed and the upper limit of a pregnancy is reached. As a result, we humans meet our children ahead of time, their bodies assailable and exposed, ours exhausted and hypervigilant.Raw Content, the latest novel by author and academic Naomi Booth, exists in the psychological and social hinterlands of new motherhood; heart ablaze, nerves frayed, a mind willing itself to do the impossible, namely, to make the world safe. The book centres on Grace, a legal editor who finds herself unexpectedly pregnant. She denies the impending reality of her situation until the last moment, before hastily setting up house and playing families with her boyfriend and her newborn baby. At which point, the stage is set; Grace, alternately brittle and open-hearted, is thrust into a new unreality of alien bodies, uncomfortable proximities, needs, flesh, insatiable hungers.What follows is a stylistically elegant, emotionally astute, but ultimately somewhat limited exploration of Grace’s descent into postpartum psychological distress, most notably OCD. It’s an important topic that Booth treats with due care and seriousness, but there remains a challenge in how to effectively render the associative, hypnogogic quality of a mind in the process of glitching and fixating, grappling with a love so intense that it begins to edge toward psychosis. Booth is excellent on the anatomical uncanniness of the newborn, the peril incumbent in a body so small and exposed: “Skin so thin … tiny veins rising close to the surface … the soft spot on her head, pulsing.” Where the novel is less successful, however, is in its attempts to portray the existential otherworldliness of new life, the ways in which it seems to have emerged from an eternity of nonexistence, to remind us of our own fleeting finitude. In this regard, it is hard not to draw unfavourable comparison with Claire Kilroy’sSoldier Sailor, a recent novel that more successfully captures the ways in which the quotidian and social demands of early motherhood can coexist with the preternatural.Booth knows that too much is asked of too few, in spaces that are too small, and in lives with little headroomThere are issues, too, with the framing devices Booth deploys. Grace’s work as a legal editor requires her to skim read criminal cases without fully apprehending the gruesome details, while at the same time demarcating the content into discrete and comprehensible sections. As a metaphor for how we so often compartmentalise the combinatorially infinite and chaotic risks of being alive, it is both fair enough and also quite heavy-handed. Similarly, the evocation of Grace’s Colne valley childhood, replete with ghosts of the Yorkshire Ripper and the traumatic child protection cases witnessed by her police officer father, are functionally evocative of the role social violence plays in shaping our individual psyches, but come across as fuzzy and ill-defined, the mechanisms of transmission undertheorised.Raw Content is most successful when it is most rooted. Booth observes the hundreds of small, repetitive actions that are required when caring for a newborn with admirable precision and wry detachment. There are moments of acerbic and witty insight. The novel is also rightly critical of the ways in which we have individualised and privatised the task of parenthood, building a social model that is increasingly atomised and isolated and then acting shocked when there is no mythical village left to help raise the child. Booth knows that too much is asked of too few, in spaces that are too small, and in lives that have too little headroom for care and community.She also raises the idea that in having a child, one often unwittingly jump-starts the process of “re-parenting” a version of one’s younger self. This means that far from the healing, cathartic experience some new parents might imagine, what actually happens is that older, unmet needs and traumas can begin to reassert themselves. A complex and often life-altering experience, it is one of many that Raw Content touches on but stops short of truly exploring or presenting to the reader in new or striking ways. In this sense, it is emblematic of the book as a whole. It’s a strong, well-written novel, but one that attempts to take on a clutch of the heaviest, most psychospiritually and socioculturally freighted things a human can experience. In doing so, it inevitably sacrifices the depth of its insights for the breadth of its gestures.Raw Content by Naomi Booth is published by Corsair (£18.99).

Silver lamé letters on a black background, spelling Here Is a Gale Warning, sounded the alarm for an unspecified emergency. A half century later, Finn-Kelcey’s act, a video of which flickers above one of the two main galleries atKettle’s Yardand gives this exhibition its title, no longer seems so enigmatic. From climate change to economic precarity to rising fascism, we are living in an age of concurrent catastrophes. The future is here, the storm already blowing.Artists have always responded to the exigencies of their times, but these days it’s museums that are uniquely under pressure. Public campaigns to make institutions more diverse and accessible have mounted just as governments around the world move to strip them of budgets and their audiences of rights. Museums have a responsibility to grapple with the cultural fallout, though the trend for mounting group exhibitions around critical issues can feel like an anxious plea for survival. Art, meanwhile, isn’t well served by sloganeering. Assembling works ranging from documentary to totally abstract around the assertion that they “warn us of political, social and ecological upheaval”, Here Is a Gale Warning seems painfully aware of this conundrum, but succumbs to it anyway.Take, for instance, the show’s opening salvo, God Kennel – A Tabernacle, a wooden sculpture resembling a doghouse suspended upside down from the ceiling. Also by Finn-Kelcey, it hovers above the floorplan of a flat in a nearby Cambridge council estate, rendered to scale in masking tape byAnne Tallentireso that it extends across the floor into the neighbouring gallery. Clever and economical, Tallentire’s work brings a working-class domicile into Kettle’s Yard, a museum attached to the former home of wealthy art collectors. Yet the pairing is presented as a statement about the UK housing crisis, a topic subsequently abandoned – and one that doesn’t quite sync with Finn-Kelcey’s own reference to the Ark of the Covenant.View image in fullscreenEphemeral … a still from a video work by Cecilia Vicuña.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Electronic Arts Intermix, New YorkIn the next room, Finn-Kelcey’s video, along with her tantalising photographs of hands in boxing gloves about to burst airborne bubbles, keep company withCecilia Vicuña’s Precarios. Ephemeral sculptures made of rubbish the artist gathered from streets near her home in New York City, or from the banks of a river in her native Chile, these are heartbreakingly anthropomorphic, fragile monuments made of the very materials with which we’re destroying our planet and ourselves.Pia Arke’s nearby video Arctic Hysteria, named for a pseudo-scientific condition said to inflict Inuit women, shows the Greenlandic artist crawling naked over an enormous photograph of Nuugaarsuk Point, taken with an inhabitable, hut-shaped camera, before tearing it to shreds. The raw performance invokes the violence of Danish colonisation on Greenlandic women’s bodies – all the more apt now that Donald Trump has said he wants to claim the island for the US.I’ve never seen Arke, Finn-Kelcey and Vicuña exhibited together before, and their grouping feels poignant and elegiac. Yet beyond shared environmental concerns, the strength of these works lies in the fact that their meaning remains slippery.The rest of the show is far more abstract and vaguer still in its relevance to the theme.Tarek Lakhrissi’s Unfinished Sentence I, an installation of hanging spears and tridents, is a reference – or so we’re told – to the lesbian feminist Amazons in Monique Wittig’s novel Les Guérillères. Clanging sounds clipped from TV shows such as Xena: Warrior Princess and Buffy the Vampire Slayer play in the background, adding drolly to the work’s militant atmosphere, though the weapons on display are too dull and crudely welded to much threaten the patriarchy. Wall text also explains that lavender gels on the overhead lights are a reference to the LGBTQ+ community, but tinted so faintly they’re almost unnoticeable, they hardly enhance the visibility of queer lives.View image in fullscreenLike an acid-dipped astral projection … Justin Caguiat’s Pissing in the Stars.Photograph: Courtesy the artist, Stuart Shave and Modern Art, LondonMore than a dozen small hand-loom weavings byCandace Hill-Montgomeryhang on the walls of both galleries. Incorporating objects sourced from the artist’s friends and family, their titles nod to references as diverse asBrice MardenandGeorge Floyd, though their colourful patterns are entirely abstract. AlongsideJustin Caguiat’s Pissing in the Stars, a monumental painting like an acid-dipped astral projection, they seem far more meditative than premonitory. Interspacing 03, a Tallentire sculpture of stacked polystyrene, gridded paper and colourful tape rolls, is described in a wall label as being somehow about the prison system – though it appeared to me as tersely minimalist as any floor piece byCarl Andre. Large, collaged works byTomashi Jackson, meanwhile, render images of protests in Los Angeles and London inscrutable through layers of screen-printed paint, paper and vinyl. Although their textured surfaces are highly engaging, they only became legible when I viewed them through my mobile phone. Like so many other works on display whose subjects are identified in wall labels, they relied a bit too much on outside mediation.Then again, that’s how we experience most things nowadays. Art, protests and natural disasters all come to us flattened, abstracted and annotated on our tiny screens. Museums can show us other ways of looking at the world that don’t inscribe culture within an equally limiting frame. Abstraction doesn’t need to warn us to be worthy of our attention. It’s enough to make us feel things we can’t explain.Here Is a Gale Warning is at Kettle’s Yard, Cambridge, until 29 JuneExplore more on these topicsArt and designreviewsShareReuse this content"

Playwrights Stephen Christopher and Graeme Smith are having none of that.Any time someone threatens us with a backstory in this funny and heartening three-hander, they halt the action with a meta-theatrical flourish and put us back on track. Too much trawling through the past, says one character, and we’ll be blaming everything on medieval serfs.Causes, then, are put aside. What we do know is that 40-year-old Craig (Ross Allan) has a history with drugs, perhaps not so different to that of the younger Jay (Craig Mclean), and that Donny (Stephen Docherty), a man in his 60s, still feeling the loss of his mother, can get through several bottles of wine and spirits in a day.As Gareth Southgate puts toxic masculinityback in the headlines, here are men being vulnerable, scared and supportive. They take fright at being referred to as friends (too intimate), but look out for each other as only those who understand weakness can. They are also very funny.View image in fullscreenPhysical comedy … Ross Allan as Craig, right, and Craig Mclean as Jay in Dancing Shoes.Photograph: Tommy Ga-Ken WanIn his inaugural season atA Play, a Pie and a Pint, Guardian journalist Brian Logan directs with a keen eye for physical comedy, not least when Donny confesses his secret love of dancing. Thanks to the camera-happy Jay, he turns into #DancingDonny, an internet sensation with 1.5m online hits. It could all go terribly wrong, yet this man who knows nothing of social media somehow straddles the generational divide to find solace in real life.Like Dorothy in her ruby slippers, he finds magic in his red shoes. Like the Ugly Duckling, he risks ridicule to show his true self. In a brilliant performance, Docherty combines earnestly clunky moves with unselfconscious joy.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.‘The first thing to say is that I’m a terrible swimmer,” says Amber Butchart, curator of a new exhibition on swimming that opens at the Design Museum in London this week. Growing up, school swimming lessons were “horrible, traumatic” – the cold water, the humiliation, the scrutiny from teenage boys. But something shifted when she moved to Margate 10 years ago and discovered the joy of swimming in the resort’s huge tidal pool, which was built in the 1930s. “This sounds quite pretentious, but it’s this idea of becoming one with the horizon,” says Butchart. “It’s almost like an existential feeling of the vastness of the world and being physically a part of that when you’re immersed in water. It’s transformational.”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Splash! A Century of Swimming and Style explores our enduring love affair with swimming, from Britain’s lido boom of the 1920s and 30s to the Mermaidcore trend which has been all over TikTok in recent years. Among the 200 exhibits are the first Olympic solo swimming gold medal won by a British woman, a selection of men’s Speedos from the 1980s and the iconic red swimsuit worn by Pamela Anderson in Baywatch. Though the exhibition tells the story of swimming through the lens of design and fashion, Butchart was keen to avoid the kitschy stereotypes of “bathing beauties” that often accompany the theme, and to take a deeper dive into the politics of the swimming pool.View image in fullscreen“It’s transformational.” Amber Butchart photographed at the Walpole Bay Tidal Pool in Margate. Photograph: Alun Callender“Obviously it’s a show about design and architecture and fashion, but there are so many social histories, and also wider global histories, that I wanted to try to get in as well, because this idea of outdoor swimming, the sea as redemptive, this is not the case for everyone. There are many communities in Britain that aren’t taught to swim for various reasons. And I’m in Kent, where we have people crossing [the Channel] in small boats which is this enormous tragedy. The sea is not a sanctuary for everyone.”Butchart first had the idea for the exhibition during the pandemic, when indoor pools were closed and her daily swims in the sea became a ritual to be cherished, something “life affirming”. Margate was one of the first British resorts to promote sea bathing as a health cure in the 1700s, so it seems fitting that this is where the story begins. The oldest item on display is a knitted municipal bathing costume that would have been rented to swimmers by the Margate Corporation (the logo is fetchingly stamped on the front) in the 1920s. “What swimwear does is it allows access to public space,” says Butchart. “You can’t go swimming in a public space if you don’t have a swimsuit. So it’s immediately getting into those questions of who has access and who is not given access.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenClockwise from top left: The iconic red swimsuit worn by Pamela Anderson in Baywatch; Rebirth swimwear designed for non-binary and gender non-conforming people; a 1920s Margate Corporation bathing costume; Olympic swimmer Alice Dearing wearing a Soul Cap swim cap. Photographs: Zuma Press/Alamy; Colectivo Multipolar; Luke Hayes/Design Museum; Soul CapButchart, a fashion historian who began her career working in a vintage clothing store, says she has an abiding love for 1950s swimwear, but adds: “I was very aware that so many stories about swimwear in the past promoted particular types of bodies and excluded other types of bodies. So, I wanted to make this a much more expansive show.”One of the items on display is the swimsuit worn by Alice Dearing at the Tokyo Olympics. Dearing was the first black woman to represent Team GB in an Olympic swimming event and co-founder of theBlack Swimming Association. In 2022 shecollaborated withSoul Cap, a company that creates swim caps for people with afro hair, locs and braids. Thecaps were bannedfrom the Olympics in 2021 by the International Swimming Federation on the basis that they didn’t follow the “natural form of the head”. The decision was reversed the following year.As well as examining the social and cultural history of swimming, the exhibition will showcase contemporary designers and architects who are coming up with solutions to improve access to swimming spaces, whether it be theUK’s first beach huts purpose-built for people with disabilities in Boscombe, or a range ofswimwear for non-binary, trans and gender non-conforming people. There will also be a short film fromSubversive Sirens, a Minnesota-based synchronised swimming team whose mission statement is “black liberation, equity in swimming, radical body acceptance and queer visibility”.View image in fullscreenAccessible beach huts in Boscombe, designed by ABIR Architects. Photograph: ABIR ArchitectsNot only does the exhibition look at what we wear in the water, but it also charts the rise of the seaside as a place for showing off the latest fashions – the pier and the promenade doubling up as an outdoor catwalk. “One of the things I love about living at the seaside is that people take more risks with what they’re wearing,” says Butchart. “The sartorial rules can be broken.” One of her favourite items on display is a pair of 1930s “beach pyjamas”. Pioneered by Coco Chanel, this trend flourished in fashionable French resorts such as Juan-les-Pins and Deauville, eventually making its way across the Channel. “It was the first time women were really allowed to wear trousers in public for the first time,” says Butchart.View image in fullscreenWomen on the promenade at Thorpe Bay, Essex, wearing matching beach pyjamas. Photograph: JA Hampton/Getty ImagesThe rise of beachwear coincided with the golden age of lido building, with art deco wonders such as the Jubilee Pool in Penzance popping up in coastal locations around the UK. The magnificent pool – the largest surviving saltwater lido in the country –reopenedin 2016 following an extensive community campaign. Many of our public baths and lidos have not been so fortunate.View image in fullscreenThe art deco Jubilee Pool in Penzance, the largest saltwater lido in the UK. Photograph: Liz Kay PhotographyThe timeline of the exhibition plots the rise of overseas package holidays, the ensuing decline of many British seaside resorts, and the environmental issues facing open water swimmers today. And while the solutions to some problems belong firmly in the 21st century – the ongoing search for alternatives to fossil fuel-derived synthetics for manufacturing swimwear, for example – for others, we must look to the past. Butchart believes that the connection between the seaside and wellbeing that made resorts such as Margate, Brighton and Scarborough fashionable in the 1800s could prove to be their salvation. She points to an initiative in her adopted home town of Margate – afree community beach saunain a recreated Victorian bathing machine – as a perfect example of a “full circle moment”.From the golden age of lidos to sewage in our seas, kiss-me-quick to queer visibility, the scope of the exhibition is as expansive as those horizon views from the Margate tidal pool. Butchart hopes that visitors will find it thought-provoking. But most of all, she hopes it will inspire them: “If people leave the exhibition thinking ‘I just really want to go for a swim’, that would be lovely.”Splash!

Lift out into a colander and leave to steam dry while you blanch the remaining broccoli.Melt the butter in a saute pan over a medium heat, then add the onion and cook, stirring often, for 15 minutes, until soft and just taking on some colour. Tip in the flour, cook, stirring, for two minutes, then gradually add the milk, whisking in each addition until smooth before adding more. Bring the sauce to a boil, then simmer, stirring so it doesn’t stick, for two minutes, until the sauce thickens.Take the pan off the heat, then stir in 100g of the cheddar and the nutmeg, and season to taste. Drain the butter beans, then pour them into the sauce and stir to coat.Turn on the grill to high. Lay the broccoli and three-quarters of the walnuts in a large baking dish, then pour the sauce all over the top. Pull up a few spears, so they poke out of the sauce, then sprinkle over the remaining 25g cheddar.Grill for five minutes, until bubbly and golden, sprinkle over the remaining walnuts and some black pepper, and serve.Sesame, carrot, orange and crispy bean saladView image in fullscreenSophie Wyburd’s sesame carrot, orange and crisp bean salad.Prep20 minCook40 minServes4as a side500g carrots1 tsp sweet smoked paprikaOlive oilSalt and pepper3 tbsp honey580g jarbutter beans, or 1½ 400g tins butter beans50g sesame seeds1 tsp cumin seeds30gflat-leaf parsley,finely chopped2 oranges150g tahiniHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7.

Follow these nine simple steps to create crumbly delights that you’ll make again and againFelicity CloakeWed 26 Mar 2025 08.00 EDTShareOatcakes are that glorious thing: portable porridge – a high-fibre, high-energy, pocket-friendly snack that’s almost as good on its own as it is on a cheeseboard with a wedge of Hebridean blue. Commercial versions, however (which often contain some very un-Scottish palm oil), can be so sturdy that they could double as chipboard, but once you taste these crumbly, richly flavoured, homemade alternatives, you’ll never go back.Prep10 minCook40 minMakesAbout 14200g medium oatmeal50g pinhead oatmeal25g porridge oats75g butter¼ tsp salt¼ tsp brown sugar2 tbsp fine oatmeal, or plain flour of your choice (gluten-free is fine), plus extra for dusting1 Toast the oatmeal and oatsView image in fullscreenHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Line a large, preferably rimmed baking tray with baking paper and tip in the medium and pinhead oatmeals and the porridge oats. Spread out and bake for about 15 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally to ensure they brown evenly; you should be able to smell them toasting even with the door closed.View image in fullscreen2 A note on the butterView image in fullscreenMeanwhile, put the kettle on for the boiling water in the next step. Dice the butter and put it in a heatproof jug – if you’d prefer to keep your oatcakes vegan, you should be able to substitute most brands of plant butter or coconut oil (though the latter will give them a distinctly tropical flavour).3 Flavour the toasted oatmealView image in fullscreenLeaving the oven on, use the baking paper in the tray to funnel the toasted oats into a large heatproof bowl. Stir in the salt and sugar – both are optional, but recommended, though you may well wish to adjust the amounts of each to taste, or indeed to add another flavouring such as dried seaweed flakes, black pepper, chilli, finely grated hard cheese, seeds or sweet spices (ginger or cinnamon, say).4 Make the oatcake doughView image in fullscreenPour 75ml boiling water on to the butter, leave to sit briefly, then stir until melted. If you’d like to add a liquid flavouring such as Marmite or honey, add this now, then mix the lot into the toasted oats, along with the fine oatmeal or flour to make a damp but coherent dough; if it’s too wet, add a little more flour.5 Prepare the baking kitLightly grease the same sheet of baking paper that you used to toast the oats; depending on the size of the tray, you may need a second sheet and a second tray. Alternatively, bake the oatcakes in two batches, keeping the cut-out, uncooked biscuits in the fridge for up to a couple of days (or freeze them and bake from frozen, though if you do that, they’ll take longer to cook).6 Flatten and shapeView image in fullscreenDust a work surface with fine oatmeal or flour, then use your hands or a rolling pin to pat out the dough until it’s about 5mm thick (if you prefer your oatcakes thinner and crisper, by all means go for it). Use a cutter or glass of your desired size (I use a 5cm one) to cut out the oatcakes, re-rolling any scraps and cutting out more oatcakes.7 Bake for 20 minutesView image in fullscreenArrange the oatcakes on the lined baking tray (s), bearing in mind that, if you’re short on space, they don’t really spread during baking, so can be positioned quite close together. Put in the oven and bake for 20 minutes, turning the tray around after 10 minutes to ensure they cook evenly.8 Flip and finish bakingUsing a palette knife or spatula, carefully flip over each oatcake, then bake for a further five to 10 minutes, depending on how crisp you like them. Remove, leave to cool and firm up, then tuck in. Alternatively, store in an airtight container; they keep and freeze well, too, so long as they’re wrapped up tightly.9 Alternative usesThese oatcakes are more fragile than the commercial kind; if you end up with a few leftover crumbs, try scattering them with a little sugar over fruit and baking, or on macaroni or cauliflower cheese, or toast and toss them with pasta or with yoghurt and honey – anywhere you want to add a bit of crunch, really.Explore more on these topicsFoodFelicity Cloake's masterclassBiscuitsBritish food and drinkVegetarian food and drinkSide dishesBakingfeaturesShareReuse this content"
